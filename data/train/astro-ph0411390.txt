    "galex , the galaxy evolution explorer is a @xmath11 telescope devoted to observing the ultraviolet ( uv in two bands centered at about 153 m and 231 nm ) sky in several imaging surveys including an all - sky imaging survey and several spectroscopic surveys ( martin et al . 2004 , barlow et al . 2004 ) .",
    "this paper presents the first analysis of the galex early release spectroscopic observations available from galex .",
    "the european large area iso survey ( elais ) is a database of deep @xmath12 observation carried out with iso to study the extragalactic universe in the ir range .",
    "the correlation of elais with uv data allows us to carry out a multi - wavelength study and to estimate the dust attenuation to deduce and compare star formation rates ( sfr ) estimated from uv and ir .",
    "applications of this work are related to lyman break galaxies discovered at @xmath13 ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 , lowenthal et al . 1997 ) and now to even higher redshift galaxies at @xmath14 with the hubble ultra deep field by bunker et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and maybe @xmath15 ( pello et al . 2004 ) .",
    "although the present sample in not purely uv - selected , it aims at better understanding how to correct for the dust attenuation in these galaxies .",
    "it could also lead to a way of understanding uv characteristics of ir - bright galaxies .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 in this paper .",
    "galex observed the elais s1 field for 12198 sec . in the imaging mode on 15 september 2003 and 31267 sec . in the spectroscopic mode on 24 september 2003 .",
    "this field had already been observed by the infrared space observatory ( iso ) using isocam .",
    "the southern field , s1 , centered at @xmath19 = 00h34m444 , @xmath20 = -43deg2812  ( j2000.0 ) , covers an area of the sky of about 2 @xmath21 2 deg@xmath22 .",
    "the final band - merged elais catalogue ( rowan - robinson et al . 2003 ) , containing 3523 sources , is available through the elais web site . the s1 catalog ( complete at the 5 @xmath3 level ) contains 462 sources in the flux density range 0.5 - 150 mjy ( la franca et al . 2004 ) .",
    "galex ir0.2 pipeline detected 959 spectra within the 1.2-deg field of view that we cross - correlated with the elais s1 .",
    "the area of the common field is about 0.5 deg@xmath22 .",
    "our elais s1 sample was selected by cross - correlating the uv galex spectroscopic sample with the mid ir ( mir at @xmath2 ) iso catalogue assuming that the emission from objects within a circular aperture of 6-arcsec radius could be from the same object .",
    "this cross - correlation provided us with 88 objects , most of which proved to be galactic foreground stars . from this sample ,",
    "19 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts were finally selected ( table 1 ) and we focus on this sample to carry out a multi - wavelength analysis .",
    "all the objects except two are below @xmath23 : their average fuv luminosity is @xmath24 @xmath5 and their average ir luminosity @xmath25 @xmath5 where log(l ) are luminosities in erg.s@xmath26 . assuming luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs ) luminosities in the range @xmath27 and ultra luminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ) have @xmath28 ( chary & elbaz 2001 , goldader et al .",
    "2002 ) , 12 of them qualify as lirgs , 4 objects are seyfert 1 and 1 object is classified as a liner .",
    "two objects are at @xmath29 , their uv luminosities are above @xmath30 and their ir luminosities are about @xmath31 i.e. ultra luminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ) . however , since they are classified by elais as seyfert 1 , the contribution of the central non - thermal qso is very likely to be predominent for these objects and their study is outside the scope of the present paper which is to study star - forming objects and their dust attenuation .",
    "the interpretation of uv spectra must mainly deal with two parameters : the stellar population ( with associated parameters : star formation rate , age , metallicity , etc . ) and the dust reddening ( with associated parameters : attenuation curve , amount of dust , etc . ) . in order to get back to the former",
    ", we have to correct for the latter .",
    "to estimate this correction , calzetti , kinney & storchi - bergmann ( 1994 ) fitted the observed uv continuum ( corrected for the foreground extinction ) by a powerlaw expressed as @xmath8 in the range @xmath32 .",
    "they selected windows to exclude absorption lines and the @xmath33 dust feature which might cause a departure from the assumed power law .",
    "for their sample of starbursts , the resulting @xmath7 was found to correlate with the balmer optical depth and therefore with the dust content .",
    "one interesting point is that the attenuation curve deduced from calzetti , kinney & storchi - bergmann s ( 1994 ) sample does not show any evidence from the @xmath33 dust feature .",
    "we estimated the uv slope @xmath7 of our sample after visually inspecting the spectra and discarding pixels in absorption lines or where the signal - to - noise ( @xmath34 ) was low .",
    "following calzetti , kinney & storchi - bergmann , we assumed that no @xmath33 dust feature is present and keep the corresponding pixels in the fit .",
    "the slopes obtained from the fit over the left pixels are listed in table 1 with the associated uncertainty @xmath35 .",
    "figure  1 presents one of the best and one of the worst fits over the observed spectra . for elaisc15_j0035 - 4356 , lying at the edge of the field of view and close to a bright object , the slope can not be estimated . for most of the galex database ,",
    "we have the uv color @xmath36 which can be used ( buat et al .",
    "2004 , schiminovich et al .",
    "04 , arnouts et al . 2004 ) to evaluate the uv slope @xmath7 .",
    "so , it is interesting to compare the estimated @xmath7 to the @xmath36 colors ( figure 2 ) .",
    "there is no apparent relationship between the galex @xmath36 color and the uv slope @xmath7 for the complete sample .",
    "however , as shown by the analysis of fuse spectra by buat et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and expected from models ( e.g. leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) , the continuum of starburst galaxies flattens below @xmath37 and it can not be fitted over the full @xmath38 by a single power law .",
    "if we restrict our sample to galaxies with @xmath39 , @xmath7 correlates with @xmath36 and the trend is very consistent with the galex @xmath36 vs. @xmath40 relationship found by kong et al .",
    "( 2004 ) within an absolute uncertainty of about @xmath41 mag . to further check this , we have integrated kinney et al.s ( 1993 ) templates into galex filters ( except the bulge and elliptical templates ) .",
    "the location and standard deviation of these points is consistent with our data for @xmath9 .",
    "for this reason , the wavelength range used for the fit is restricted to rest - frame wavelengths @xmath42 .",
    "we suggest that any estimation of @xmath7 from @xmath36 should include a k - correction above about @xmath43 as performed in schiminovich et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and arnouts et al .",
    "by construction , all our objects are detected in uv and in mir . from the @xmath2 fluxes",
    ", we evaluated the ir bolometric luminosity @xmath44 ( chary & elbaz 2001 ) and we estimated the @xmath45 ratio .",
    "the 1-@xmath3 uncertainty for the @xmath2 flux to ir bolometric luminosity relation is about 0.2 in @xmath46 .",
    "however , by accounting for measurement errors , it could rise to 0.5 - 0.7 in @xmath46 .",
    "galex spectroscopic observations present the first opportunity of comparing actual spectroscopic @xmath7 values to the @xmath45 ratio for lirgs .",
    "this is important because estimates obtained from colors ( see for instance meurer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for a discussion of spectroscopic and photometric @xmath7 s ) could lead to larger uncertainties in the evaluation of @xmath7 since the whole spectral energy distribution is binned to two points ( with their associated uncertainties ) .",
    "therefore , we loose the information about lines , the shape of the attenuation curve and the star formation history necessary to get the best @xmath7 . moreover , we do not need to correct for band - shifting and k - corrections ( cf .",
    "the location of our galaxy sample in the @xmath45 vs. @xmath7 diagram , plotted in figure 3 , shows that a simple law can not represent the whole sample of galaxies . indeed , if some of them follow kong et al.s ( 2004 ) ir / fuv vs. @xmath7 law for starbursts , most of them fall above the relation and suggest a higher extinction that would be evaluated from @xmath7 .",
    "ulirgs from goldader et al .",
    "( 2002 ) are also overplotted in this diagram .",
    "all but one lie in the top - right zone of the diagram ( greater uv attenuations and flatter slopes ) , these objects are evidently much more extreme than ours but they seems to have a similar behavior .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that most of the seyfert 2 galaxies have the highest @xmath45 , which might mean that there is an ir contribution from a dust torus around the qso ( rowan - robinson et al .",
    "2003 ) . by using the relation given by buat et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , we can estimate the fuv dust attenuation listed in table 1 .",
    "the median value for our sample is @xmath10 in agreement with buat et al .",
    "( 2004 ) median value of @xmath47 for their fir selected sample while their median @xmath48 for their nuv selected sample .    from the spectrum of the nearest galaxy in the sample : elaisc15_j003828 - 433848 at @xmath49",
    ", we can see a trough in the spectrum which is consistent with being produced by a bump in the attenuation law at the same location that the one present in the milky way attenuation curve near 220 nm ( figure 4 ) . within the limit of this early calibration of galex spectroscopy",
    ", the fit to the continuum gives @xmath50 .",
    "assuming the presence of the 220 nm bump in this lirg , we can estimate a new slope by fitting a power - law without accounting for wavelengths in the range @xmath51 nm , i.e. where the effect of the bump is maximal ( e.g. witt & gordon 2000 ) . the new value of the slope is @xmath52 i.e. at 8 @xmath3 from the previous value .",
    "this galaxy falls above kong et al .",
    "law ( see figure 3 ) but if we use the new value of @xmath7 , the galaxy shifts to the right ( shallower @xmath7 ) and gets closer to the curve . of course , it is difficult to draw conclusions from this single instance , but motta et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggest the presence of the same feature in the spectrum of a galaxy at @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , even though the sample is built from normal galaxies and not lirgs , it is worth noticing that rowan - robinson ( 2003 ) found that a normal galactic extintion law seems consistent with their analysis of their data . finally , the only high @xmath34 large sample of uv spectra is kinney et al .",
    "( 1993 ) atlas , it contains some highly reddened starbursts which do not show the 220-nm feature .",
    "addressing this point would therefore be an important goal for the interpretation of rest - frame uv observations and to get better estimates of the dust attenuation before computing sfrs : we need to analyse a sample of high @xmath34 galex spectra containing several galaxy types .",
    "we list , in table 1 , the sfrs estimated from kennicutt ( 1998 ) relations .",
    "after correction for the dust attenuation in fuv estimated from the ir / fuv ratio ( buat et al .",
    "2004 ) , both sfrs correlate with a slope 1.0 and a standard deviation of 6.6 @xmath54 for non - seyfert galaxies i.e. for those where the ir flux is only coming for recycled star photons and not from a dust torus that would surround the qso .",
    "this paper presents the first uv spectra of lirgs .",
    "the analysis of galex spectra with complementary @xmath12 data from elais allowed us to define a sample of galaxies in the redshift range @xmath55 with multi - wavelength data .",
    "we show that the raw galex uv color @xmath36 can not be used to estimate the uv slope @xmath7 for galaxies at redshift above @xmath43 because the galex fuv band contains rest - frame flux below @xmath56 where spectra flatten . from this multi-@xmath57 study ,",
    "we compare two dust attenuation tracers : the uv slope @xmath7 and the ir / uv ratio .",
    "we show that for ir - bright objects with an average dust attenuation in fuv : @xmath10 , the former does not seem to be valid .",
    "however , the best s / n galaxy at @xmath49 could show a hint of the presence of a bump approximatively at the same location that the @xmath33 feature in the milky way attenuation curve .",
    "if we try to correct for the effect of this bump by not using pixels in the range @xmath58 , the galaxy gets closer to the location of the starburst relationship in the @xmath59 vs. @xmath7 diagram .",
    "@xmath34 and/or available wavelength range prevent us from carrying out the same analysis on the rest of the sample and it is clear that we need to observe other high @xmath34 , low - redshift galaxies with galex .",
    "galex ( galaxy evolution explorer ) is a nasa small explorer , launched in april 2003 .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge nasa s support for construction , operation , and science analysis for the galex mission , developed in cooperation with the centre national detudes spatiales of france and the korean ministry of science and technology .",
