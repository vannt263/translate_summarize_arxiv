    "radio and x - ray observations have revealed about 140 millisecond pulsars ( msps ) in 26 globular clusters  ( gcs ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the presence of much stronger x - ray emitters can contaminate the x - ray observations of msps . because msps are the only known steady @xmath0-ray  sources in gcs  @xcite , @xmath0-ray  observations of gcs serve as an alternative channel in studying the underlying msp populations in gcs .    using the large area telescope ( lat ) ,",
    "@xmath0-rays  from 8 gcs  @xcite have been discovered , including 47 tucanae  @xcite and terzan 5  @xcite .",
    "the radiation mechanism of @xmath0-rays  is unclear . in the pulsar magnetosphere model , e.g.  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath0-rays  up to a few gev come from the msps through curvature radiation . on the other hand , inverse compton ( ic )",
    "processes resulted from energetic particles up - scattering low - energy photons , such as starlight and infrared light , may give rise to @xmath0-rays  of mev to tev energies , e.g.  @xcite . in either model , it is expected that the @xmath0-ray  luminosity of a gc is proportional to the stellar encounter rate , a measure of the number of msps in a gc .",
    "terzan 5 contains the largest number of known msps among all gcs .",
    "it was discovered as the second known @xmath0-ray  emitting gc after 47  tucanae  @xcite ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "we note that 47  tucanae was discovered in the bright source list  @xcite , while the discovery of terzan  5 in @xmath0-rays  was announced  @xcite before the release of the first fermi / lat catalog  @xcite and the report of the 8 gcs  @xcite .    like 47  tucanae",
    ", the @xmath0-ray  spectrum of terzan  5 also shows a cutoff at @xmath13  gev  @xcite . after the discovery of other six @xmath0-ray  emitting gcs  @xcite",
    ", we also identified a group of gcs with high encounter rate . using more than two years of data taken from lat",
    ", we found @xmath0-ray  emission from the directions of liller  1 , ngc  6624 , and ngc  6752  @xcite .",
    "the test - statistic maps of the regions around these 3  gcs are shown in figures  2 and 3 .",
    "for m80 , ngc  6139 , and ngc  6541 , the detection is marginal ( @xmath2 ) when it was first reported  @xcite .    for the cases where",
    "the @xmath0-ray  emission is offset from the core ( i.e. liller 1 and ngc 6624 ) , the @xmath0-ray  spectra in the energy range of 200  mev to 100  gev are presented in figure 4 .",
    "the photons above @xmath120  gev are detected at significance levels of 34 .",
    "once the existence of these high - energy photons is established , it will be easier to be reconciled in the ic models than in the pulsar magnetosphere model . in the latter case , spectral cut - offs at several gev",
    "are expected .",
    "we have investigated the properties of the @xmath0-ray  emitting globular clusters  @xcite . by correlating the observed @xmath0-ray  luminosities with various cluster properties , we probe the origin of the high energy photons from these gcs .",
    "we found that the @xmath0-ray  luminosity is positively correlated with the encounter rate and the metalicity [ fe / h ] which places an intimate link between the @xmath0-ray  emission and the msp population .",
    "we also found that the @xmath0-ray  luminosity increases with the energy densities of the soft photons at the cluster location . when combining two parameters at the same time , the correlation is even stronger . the edge - on fundamental plane relations of @xmath0-ray  gcs are depicted in figure  5 .",
