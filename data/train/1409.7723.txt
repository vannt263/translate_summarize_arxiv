    "the distribution of these particles as they orbit the earth is plotted in fig  [ fig : margdist ] . since the mechanical energy of the space object increases as the square of the velocity , a larger uncertainty in velocity leads to to a larger variation in the mechanical energy which manifests as a larger uncertainty in the semi - major axis .",
    "thus , a lower initial uncertainty in velocity may be a great advantage in estimation since the trajectories are closer off and the resulting pdf is less stretched and distorted and more akin to a gaussian for a longer time period as seen in figure [ fig : margdist ] .",

    "a space object tracking scenario usually involves one or more sensors that are employed to record observations .",

    ", the ukf can be employed to estimate the state of the space object .",
    "the between - measurement distortion of the state pdf from gaussian will be limited if frequent measurements are available .",
    "it is also computationally efficient as the unscented transform requires only 2n+1 sample points for an n dimensional estimation problem .",
    "moreover , state estimation with ukf is free from resampling procedures that are customary to sequential monte carlo methods .",
    "+ once the space object is outside the field of view , the pdf is extensively distorted since no further measurements will be recorded till the object re - enters the fov . as it is free from restrictive assumptions , it is more advantageous to use a particle filter here especially since the actual pdf may be captured to any degree of accuracy by increasing the number of particles .",
    "once the object exits the fov and the particles are sampled , they are propagated through time while keeping the individual weights @xmath69 constant until the next measurement is recorded , i.e. when the object re - enters the fov .",
    "the negligible process noise and near periodic orbits help enable the propagation of the state pdf for extended time periods when the measurements are sparse without risking particle depletion which is a problem often observed in typical pf implementations@xcite@xcite .",

    "this has to be carried out once the estimated position of the object is outside the field of view .",
    "transitioning from pf to ukf on the other hand requires a gaussian pdf to be retrieved back from the ensemble of particles . once the object re - enters the fov and the first measurement is registered ,",

    "the likelihoods for each particle @xmath70 at instant @xmath71 may be computed as @xmath72 where @xmath28 is the measurement recorded at that instant .",
    "the mean and covariance of this weighted sample can be used to parameterize the necessary gaussian pdf which may be computed as @xmath73    @xmath74    while there is a chance that a significant fraction of the particles may undergo weight degeneration , a lower initial uncertainty in velocity keeps the trajectories closer and the risk of weight depletion can be avoided .",
    "this is also the case that is encountered in most practical situations .",
    "for instance , when propagated with an initial uncertainty of 10 m/s in each direction , the particles did not suffer from weight depletion even after significant time spans .",
    "it should be emphasized that if the process noise had been large , the particles would have been considerably scattered irrespective of the magnitude of initial uncertainty .",
    "hence , the absence of model uncertainty plays an important role in preventing particle depletion .",
    "fig  [ fig : trajectories ] shows the trajectories followed by particles sampled from an initial gaussian distribution with mean @xmath31^{t}$ ] for the 2d keplerian problem .",
    "even though the particles appear to diverge in the beginning , they come back to their respective initial states on completion of a full time period .",
    "clearly the trajectories appear denser near the initial state and are less likely to encounter weight depletion at nearby regions.hence the periodicity of the orbit also plays a significant role in preventing weight depletion .        based on this observation , the following proposition regarding particle depletion in such noise free periodic systems may be made .",
    "consider a periodic dynamical system governed by @xmath75 with an uncertain initial state characterized by a gaussian pdf with mean and covariance ( @xmath76 ) . given a measurement model @xmath77 associated with this system , where @xmath78 is a zero mean gaussian noise term with covariance r , a lower bound on the probability that the measurement likelihood of any particle that is sampled from the initial gaussian pdf , would be above a given threshold @xmath79 , after a full period @xmath80 , of the mean trajectory ,",
    "is given by the total probability enclosed inside an @xmath81 contour ellipse of a gaussian pdf parameterized by the covariance matrix c given by @xmath82 .",
    "here @xmath83 , where @xmath84 stands for the mean initial state @xmath85 , @xmath86 for period of the orbit as a function of initial state @xmath85 and m may be computed as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the largest eigenvalue of c.    clearly , a lower value of @xmath91 would indicate a higher risk of weight degeneration . from the given expression , it can be observed that @xmath91 is directly proportional to the smallest eigenvalue of r , @xmath88 , and inversely proportional to the largest eigenvalue of the matrix m , @xmath92 .",
    "hence , a smaller measurement covariance and a larger initial state uncertainty would increase the risk of particle depletion .",
    "the matrix @xmath93 indicates the transformation that the covariance matrix p undergoes over a full period of the mean trajectory . from equation of the matrix m",
    ", it can be concluded that the sensitivity of time period w.r.t .",
    "the initial condition , @xmath94 , plays an important role in determining the risk of weight degeneration . for gravitational systems , the square of time period is proportional to the cube of the semi major axis which in turn is a function of the total energy .",
    "but since mechanical energy varies with the square of the velocity , it can be concluded that the time period of the gravitational system is sensitive towards the uncertainty in velocity .",
    "hence , shrinking the uncertainty in velocity would keep the periods of the sampled trajectories closer off . as a result",
    ", particles along these trajectories would traverse through their initial states at almost the same times , reducing the risk of weight degeneration at that point .",
    "+ the above result is arrived at based on the fact that variation in the relative position of two points with similar periods over a full time period of either of these particles can be computed as a function of the difference in their orbital periods .",
    "this assumes that the time period @xmath95 is a differentiable function of the initial state @xmath85 . from this ,",
    "the set of points for which the given condition on the likelihood function would hold , after a full time period , of the mean trajectory , may be computed .",
    "then the lower bound that is presented in the given proposition may be computed as the probability of sampling particles from this particular set given the initial gaussian pdf @xmath96 .",
    "a derivation of the above result is presented in the appendix + fig  [ fig : transition ] shows the particle distribution in the x - y plane during the transition from pf to ukf .",
    "as expected , the particle distribution prior to registering the measurement appear stretched and distorted .",
    "once the weights are computed , the particles are resampled to generate a new ensemble .",
    "if the measurement uncertainty is small compared to the covariance of the state pdf , the resampled set would be less stretched and distorted as it can be seen from fig  [ fig : transition ] .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to approximate the resampled pdf with a single gaussian component .",
    "based on this observation , the mean and covariance of this new pdf is employed in the ukf based estimation process that follows the transition . the steps involved in implementing the ukf - pf hybrid filter are described in algorithm  [ algo ] .",

    "performance of the proposed filtering scheme is assessed by simulating the orbital dynamics for 10 periods and evaluating the root mean squared error ( rmse ) matrix of the estimated state and comparing with posterior cramer - rao lower bound(pcrb)@xcite .",
