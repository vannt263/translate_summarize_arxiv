    "this work is intended as a common generalisation of two different strands of research : a proposal from physicists for a mathematical model of space - time as a discrete poset , and a notion of a `` random linear extension '' of an infinite partially ordered set .",
    "one of our aims is to show that these two lines of research are intimately connected .",
    "the objects we study are _ causal sets _ , which are countably infinite partially ordered sets @xmath0 such that every element is above only finitely many others .",
    "a _ natural extension _ of a causal set is a bijection from @xmath1 to @xmath2 whose inverse is order - preserving ; i.e. , it is an enumeration of @xmath2 that respects the ordering @xmath3 .",
    "we consider random processes that generate a causal set one element at a time , starting with the empty poset , and at each stage adding one new maximal element , keeping track of the order in which the elements are generated .",
    "such a process is called a _",
    "growth process_. the infinite poset @xmath4 generated by a growth process is always a causal set , and the order in which the elements are generated is a natural extension of @xmath4 .",
    "we will postpone most of the formal definitions for a while , although we will introduce some notation that will be consistent with that used in the bulk of the paper .",
    "our main purpose in this section is to motivate the ideas of the paper by examining some examples . before that , we need a little terminology .    a _ ( labelled ) poset _",
    "@xmath4 is a pair @xmath5 , where @xmath2 is a set ( for us , @xmath2 will always be countable ) , and @xmath3 is a partial order on @xmath2 , i.e. , a transitive irreflexive relation on @xmath2 .",
    "an order @xmath3 on @xmath2 is a _ total order _ or _ linear order _ if each pair @xmath6 of distinct elements of @xmath2 is comparable ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) .    a _ down - set _ in @xmath4 is a subset @xmath9 such that , if @xmath10 and @xmath8 , then @xmath11 .",
    "an _ up - set _ is the complement of a down - set : a set @xmath12 such that @xmath13 and @xmath14 implies @xmath15 .",
    "a pair @xmath16 of elements of @xmath2 is a _ covering pair _ if @xmath17 , and there is no @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "we also say that @xmath20 is _ covered _ by @xmath21 , or that @xmath21 _ covers _ @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath0 is a poset , and @xmath9 , then @xmath22 denotes the restriction of the partial order to @xmath23 , and @xmath24 . for @xmath25",
    ", we also write @xmath26 to mean @xmath27 .    for @xmath28 a poset on any ground - set @xmath2 ,",
    "a _ linear extension _ of @xmath4 is a total order @xmath29 on @xmath2 such that , whenever @xmath17 , we also have @xmath30 . in the case where @xmath2 is finite , the set of linear extensions is also finite",
    ".    we will often be considering posets on the set @xmath1 , or on one of the sets @xmath31=\\{1,\\dots , k\\}$ ] , for @xmath32 , which come equipped with a `` standard '' linear order . in these cases ,",
    "suborder _ of @xmath1 or @xmath31 $ ] will be a partial order on that ground - set ( typically denoted @xmath33 or @xmath34}$ ] ) with the standard order as a linear extension , i.e. , if @xmath33 is a suborder of @xmath1 and @xmath35 , then @xmath36 is below @xmath37 in the standard order on @xmath1 .    in the case where the ground - set @xmath2 of @xmath4 is countably infinite , the natural extensions of @xmath4 correspond to the linear extensions @xmath29 with the order - type of the natural numbers : specifically , given a natural extension of @xmath4 , which is a bijection @xmath38 whose inverse is order - preserving , we obtain a linear extension @xmath29 of @xmath4 by setting @xmath39 whenever @xmath40 in the standard order on @xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ladder ] below shows the hasse diagram of a labelled causal set @xmath0 , where @xmath41 , and @xmath42 if @xmath43 .",
    "( later , we will require that the @xmath44 are distinct real numbers in @xmath45 $ ] , but the order @xmath3 imposed on the @xmath44 by @xmath4 has no relation to the order of @xmath45 $ ] . )",
    "[ hbtp ] @xmath46    the natural extensions of this poset @xmath4 are the bijections @xmath38 such that , for @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "equivalently , we require that @xmath49 is a down - set in @xmath4 , for each @xmath50 .",
    "we are interested in a particular probability measure @xmath51 on the set @xmath52 of natural extensions @xmath53 of @xmath4 , which has properties one would associate with a `` uniform '' probability measure .",
    "the @xmath54-field of measurable sets is generated by events of the form @xmath55 the set of natural extensions with `` initial segment '' @xmath56 , for @xmath32 and the @xmath57 distinct elements of @xmath1 .",
    "we call @xmath56 an _ ordered stem _ if @xmath58 is a down - set in @xmath4 , for @xmath59 : in other words if there is a natural extension of @xmath4 with this initial segment .",
    "we describe the measure @xmath51 via a random process for generating the sequence @xmath60 sequentially .",
    "given the set @xmath61 , the element @xmath62 has to be one of the minimal elements of @xmath63 , and there are at most two of these .",
    "the random process we are interested in is the one defined by the following rules :    * if there is only one minimal element @xmath64 of @xmath63 , take @xmath65 with probability  1 ; * if there are two minimal elements @xmath66 and @xmath67 of @xmath63 , set @xmath68 with probability @xmath69 and @xmath70 with probability @xmath71 .",
    "it is easy to see that the function @xmath53 generated by these rules is always a natural extension of  @xmath4 .",
    "we have described this as a process generating a random natural extension , but we can also think of it as a growth process , growing a causal set by adding one new maximal element at each step : the process always generates the same infinite causal set @xmath4 , but the order in which the elements are generated is random .",
    "we now calculate @xmath72 indeed , we choose @xmath73 with probability @xmath74 ; having done so , we choose @xmath75 with probability @xmath74 . on the other hand ,",
    "we choose @xmath76 with probability @xmath71 ; having done so , @xmath77 is the only minimal element of @xmath78 , so we choose @xmath79 with probability  1 .",
    "moreover , we claim that , whenever @xmath80 and @xmath81 are two ordered stems with @xmath82 , we have @xmath83 if the two orders @xmath56 and @xmath81 differ only by an exchange of adjacent elements ",
    "necessarily @xmath84 and @xmath85 for some @xmath86  then ( [ eq : one ] ) follows by essentially the same calculation as in ( [ eq : zero ] ) : the two probabilities @xmath87 and @xmath88 are products of terms which are the same except that one has two terms equal to @xmath74 and the other has one term equal to @xmath71 and another equal to  1 . to see ( [ eq : one ] ) in general , it suffices to show that we can step from @xmath56 to @xmath81 by a sequence of exchanges of adjacent elements , staying within the set of ordered stems .",
    "this is a standard fact about the set of linear extensions of any finite poset : to see it in this case , start with the order @xmath56 , and move each @xmath89 in turn down until it reaches position  @xmath37 .",
    "the property in ( [ eq : one ] ) is called _ order - invariance_. if we consider instead a _ finite _ poset @xmath90 , then the uniform probability measure @xmath91 on the set of linear extensions of @xmath4 satisfies order - invariance .",
    "indeed , another way of obtaining the measure @xmath51 in our example is to consider the sets @xmath92 , the finite posets @xmath93 , and the uniform measures @xmath94 on their sets of linear extensions , for each @xmath95 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath96 as @xmath97 , for each ordered initial segment @xmath80 .",
    "our second example is apparently of a very different nature .",
    "we consider a family of probability measures on the set of causal sets with ground - set @xmath1 ",
    "i.e. , models of random causal sets  and explain how these measures also satisfy an order - invariance property .    a _ random graph order _",
    "@xmath98 , with parameter @xmath99 , is defined on the set @xmath1 as follows .",
    "we take a random graph on @xmath1  for each pair @xmath100 of elements of @xmath1 , we put an edge between @xmath36 and @xmath37 with probability @xmath101 , all choices made independently .",
    "then we define the random order @xmath29 from the random graph by declaring that @xmath102 if there is an increasing sequence @xmath103 of natural numbers such that @xmath104 is an edge for each @xmath105 .",
    "equivalently , we could define the random graph order with parameter @xmath101 via a growth process , adding a new maximal element at each stage .",
    "given the restriction @xmath106}$ ] to the set @xmath31 $ ] , at the next step of the process , a random subset @xmath107 of @xmath31 $ ] is chosen , with each element taken into @xmath107 independently with probability @xmath101 .",
    "then @xmath108 is placed above the elements of @xmath107 , and the transitive closure is taken  so if @xmath37 is in @xmath107 and @xmath109 in @xmath106}$ ] , then @xmath36 is placed below @xmath108 in @xmath110}$ ] .",
    "this is a model of random posets ",
    "there are versions with the ground - set being a finite set @xmath111 $ ] , or @xmath112  with a number of interesting features , and it also has the advantage that it is relatively easy to analyse . accordingly , random graph orders have attracted a fair degree of attention in the combinatorics literature ; see , for instance  @xcite .",
    "fix some @xmath32 , and some suborder @xmath34}$ ] of @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "we claim that the probability that the order @xmath113}$ ] on @xmath31 $ ] is equal to @xmath34}$ ] is given by @xmath114})}(1-p)^{b(<^{[k]})},\\ ] ] where @xmath115})$ ] is the number of covering pairs of @xmath116,<^{[k]})$ ] , and @xmath117})$ ] is the number of incomparable pairs .    to see this , note that , if @xmath36 is covered by @xmath37 in @xmath34}$ ] , then in order for @xmath113}$ ] to equal @xmath34}$ ] , it is necessary for @xmath118 to be an edge of the random graph .",
    "also , if @xmath36 and @xmath37 are incomparable in @xmath34}$ ] , then it is necessary for @xmath118 to be a non - edge .",
    "conversely , if @xmath119 } j$ ] , but @xmath36 is not covered by @xmath37 , then there is some sequence @xmath120 of elements of @xmath31 $ ] such that @xmath121 is covered by @xmath122 in @xmath34}$ ] , for @xmath123 . provided that each edge @xmath104 is in the random graph , we will have @xmath102 whether or not the edge @xmath118 is in the random graph . thus @xmath113}$ ] is equal to @xmath34}$ ] if and only if all the covering pairs of @xmath34}$ ] span edges in the random graph , and all the incomparable pairs do not .",
    "the key point for our purposes is that the expression ( [ eq : c - b ] ) is an isomorphism - invariant of the poset @xmath34}$ ] , and so isomorphic posets have equal probabilities of arising as @xmath113}$ ] .",
    "we again call this property _ order - invariance_. an interpretation is that , if we stop the process when there are @xmath50 elements , and look at the structure of the poset , but not at the numbering of the elements , then , conditioned on this information , each linear extension of the poset is equally likely to have been the order in which the elements were generated .",
    "growth processes , of a type similar to those in example  2 , were investigated by rideout and sorkin  @xcite , who view them as possible discrete models for the space - time universe .",
    "the idea is that the elements of the ( random ) causal set form the ( discrete ) set of points in the space - time universe , and the partial order @xmath29 is interpreted as `` is in the past light - cone of '' .",
    "the order in which the elements of the causal set are generated is not deemed to have any physical meaning , so it should not be possible to extract information about this order from the causal set at any stage .",
    "rideout and sorkin thus viewed growth processes as being markov chains on the set of finite _ unlabelled _ causal sets , where each transition adds a new maximal element .",
    "they studied such processes with the property that , conditional on the causal set at some stage @xmath50 being equal to some unlabelled @xmath50-element poset @xmath4 , each linear extension of @xmath4 is equally likely to have been the order in which the elements were generated .",
    "they called this property `` general covariance '' . alternatively",
    ", we can view the rideout - sorkin processes as generating an order on the ground - set @xmath1 , as in example  2 ; then the property of general covariance translates to the property of order - invariance , as described in example  2 .    in  @xcite , rideout and sorkin",
    "characterised all growth processes satisfying general covariance as well as another condition called _ bell causality _ , and also a `` connectedness '' condition that prevents the model breaking up as a sequence of models of posets stacked on top of one another .",
    "the models satisfying all three conditions are called _ classical sequential growth models _ or _ csg models _ ; these were studied further in  @xcite .",
    "random graph orders , as in example  2 , are the prime examples of csg models . a general csg model can be described in similar terms to our description of a random graph order as a growth model ; the particular csg model is specified by a sequence of real parameters @xmath124 representing the relative probability of choosing the random set @xmath107 to be equal to a given set @xmath125 of size  @xmath95 .",
    "brightwell and georgiou  @xcite determined that the large - scale structure of any csg model is that of a semiorder , and in particular is quite unlike the observed space - time structure of the universe .",
    "varadarajan and rideout  @xcite and dowker and surya  @xcite describe the models that can arise if the connectedness condition is dropped .",
    "here there is a fascinating extra layer of complexity : the causal sets arising are all obtained by stacking `` csg models '' on top of one another , and the sizes of `` later '' components may depend on the detailed structure of `` earlier '' ones if these are finite .",
    "the underlying reason that csg models can not produce causal sets that resemble the observed universe seems to lie with the condition of bell causality : it is possible to show that any process producing causal sets of the desired type ( essentially , those induced on a discrete set of points arising from a poisson process on a lorentzian manifold ) will not satisfy this condition .",
    "our aim in this paper is , effectively , to study the class of growth processes satisfying general covariance : this class is vastly richer than the class of csg models .",
    "for instance , if we drop the labels @xmath44 from the causal set in example  1 , and consider the growth process that we described there as being a process on unlabelled posets , then the property of order - invariance again translates to general covariance",
    ".    dealing with unlabelled combinatorial structures is often awkward ; in cases similar to example  1 , it is also very unnatural .",
    "so we will deal with labelled causal sets from now on , and we want to express order - invariance in terms of notation similar to that used in example  1 .",
    "we are thus faced with the problem of how to incorporate random graph orders ( and other csg models ) into our setting .",
    "the numbering of the elements that we used in example  2 specifies the order of generation of the elements , and so these numbers can not serve as labels in the same sense as the @xmath44 are used to label the elements in example  1 .",
    "it is useful at this point to introduce another family of examples , in some ways trivial but in other ways far from it .",
    "we consider growth processes where the causal set generated is a.s .",
    "an antichain ( i.e. , no two elements are comparable ) .",
    "this is the case if we take a random graph order with @xmath126 : we certainly do want to include some such growth processes within our framework .",
    "if we require our causal sets to be labelled , then a growth process which a.s",
    ".  generates an antichain is nothing more than a sequence of random variables : the labels of the elements , in the order they are introduced .",
    "order - invariance requires that , if we condition on the set of the first @xmath50 labels , for any @xmath50 , then each of the @xmath127 orderings of these labels is equally likely .",
    "this is exactly the requirement that the sequence of labels be _",
    "exchangeable_.    one way to generate a sequence of exchangeable random labels is to take any probability distribution @xmath128 on any set @xmath129 of potential labels , and let the labels be an iid sequence of random elements of @xmath129 with probability measure @xmath128 .",
    "we will want our labels to be a.s .",
    "distinct , so we need the probability measure @xmath128 to be atomless .    the hewitt - savage theorem  @xcite states that every sequence of exchangeable random variables is a mixture of sequences of the type described above ( i.e. , there is a probability measure @xmath130 on some space of probability measures on a set @xmath129 : one measure @xmath128 is chosen according to @xmath130 , and then an iid sequence of random elements of @xmath129 is generated according to @xmath128 ) .",
    "for instance , we can take @xmath129 to be the interval @xmath45 $ ] , equipped with its usual borel @xmath54-field and lebesgue probability measure , and @xmath128 to be the uniform probability measure on @xmath129 .",
    "our growth process then operates as follows : at each stage , we introduce a new element , labelled with a uniformly random element of @xmath45 $ ] , chosen independently of all other labels , and we make the new element incomparable with all existing elements .",
    "this is indeed order - invariant : if we condition on the state of the process after @xmath50 steps  an antichain labelled with a set of @xmath50 numbers from @xmath45 $ ] , a.s .",
    "distinct  then each of the @xmath127 orders of generation is equally likely .",
    "formally , we will handle random graph orders in exactly the same way as in the example above : our growth process will proceed by taking a new element , assigning it a uniformly random label from @xmath45 $ ] , independent of any other labels and of the structure of the existing poset , and then placing the new element above some of the existing elements as described in example  2",
    ". such a growth process will be order - invariant .    in general , it is convenient to work only with causal sets labelled by elements from a specific set , and we shall choose the interval @xmath45 $ ] , which comes equipped with its standard ( compact ) topology , and the borel @xmath54-field @xmath131 generated by the topology .",
    "one generally applicable way of specifying the outcome of a growth process is by giving an _ infinite _ string of ( labels of ) elements , listed as @xmath132 in the order of their generation , together with a suborder @xmath33 of the index set @xmath1 with its standard order : @xmath35 if and only if @xmath133 in the causal set @xmath134 generated by the process .",
    "growth processes thus correspond to probability measures on the set @xmath135 of pairs @xmath136 where the @xmath137 are elements of @xmath45 $ ] and @xmath33 is a suborder of @xmath1",
    ". we will proceed by taking @xmath135 as the outcome space , with the appropriate @xmath54-field @xmath138 , and considering probability measures on @xmath139 .",
    "we will set up the notation carefully in section  [ sec : csp ] , introducing the notion of a _ causal set process _ or _",
    "causet process _ , which is effectively the same as a growth process , but where the states are formally pairs @xmath140})$ ] , where the poset @xmath34}$ ] is on the index set @xmath31 $ ] , rather than on the set @xmath141 .",
    "we give a formal definition of order - invariance , as a property of probability measures on @xmath142 , in section  [ sec : oip ] .",
    "we emphasise that we will build one space @xmath139 to accommodate _ all _ causet processes , subject only to the fairly arbitrary restriction that the set of potential labels of elements is  @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "we will then study the space of all order - invariant measures , which we will define as probability measures on @xmath139 satisfying a certain condition .",
    "this space of order - invariant measures has some good properties ; for instance , it is a convex subset of the set of all probability measures on @xmath139 , and we shall show in section  [ sec : invariant ] that it is closed in the topology of weak convergence .    in order to make a systematic study of order - invariant measures , we shall focus on the _ extremal _ order - invariant measures : those that can not be written as a convex combination of two others .",
    "an order - invariant measure that almost surely produces one fixed ( labelled ) causal set @xmath0 , as in example  1 , will be called an _ order - invariant measure on @xmath4_. the process in example  1 is in fact the only order - invariant measure on the poset @xmath4 of figure  [ fig : ladder ] , and it is extremal .",
    "we shall see an example later of a causal set with infinitely many extremal order - invariant measures on it .",
    "on the other hand , it follows from the analysis in example  3 that a labelled antichain @xmath5 admits no order - invariant measures .",
    "indeed we saw that , if an order - invariant measure generates an antichain a.s .",
    ", then there is a probability measure @xmath130 on the space of probability measures on @xmath143,{{\\mathcal b}})$ ] , such that the sequence of labels is generated by first choosing a probability measure @xmath128 according to @xmath130 , then taking an iid sequence of random variables with distribution  @xmath128 .",
    "now , if @xmath144 $ ] , and @xmath20 occurs as a label with positive probability , then @xmath145 , and in that case @xmath20 occurs as a label infinitely often with positive probability .",
    "so such a process can not generate each label in @xmath2 exactly once .",
    "there is however an abundance of extremal order - invariant measures that are measures on some fixed causal set . also , there are extremal order - invariant measures a.s .",
    "giving rise to an antichain : it follows from the discussion in example  3  in particular , from the hewitt - savage theorem  @xcite  that these are effectively the same as iid sequences of random elements of @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "our main result is theorem  [ thm : extremal ] , showing that all extremal order - invariant measures on @xmath142 are , in a sense to be made precise later , a combination of extremal order - invariant measures of these two types .",
    "sections  [ sec : csne]-[sec : oip ] are devoted to defining notation and terminology , setting up the spaces we are studying , and giving precise definitions .",
    "we also establish some useful properties of order - invariant measures in section  [ sec : oip ] . in section  [ sec : tsc ] , we give details of how examples such as the ones in this section fit into the general framework . in section",
    "[ sec : invariant ] , we show that the set of order - invariant measures is the set of measures invariant under a certain family of permutations on @xmath135 , and we derive as a consequence that the set of order - invariant measures is closed in the topology of weak convergence . in section  [ sec : eoim ] , we give a number of conditions equivalent to extremality of an order - invariant measure , and also show that every order - invariant measure is a mixture of extremal ones .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : deoim ] , we state , discuss , and prove theorem  [ thm : extremal ] .",
    "our results do not provide a _ classification _ of extremal order - invariant measures : this would necessarily involve a classification of extremal order - invariant measures on fixed causal sets , which seems likely to be prohibitively difficult . however , some partial results in this direction are given in the authors companion paper  @xcite , where order - invariant measures on fixed causal sets are studied in depth .",
    "for now , we just point out some more connections to existing literature .",
    "some years ago , the first author  @xcite studied random linear extensions of locally finite posets .",
    "the main theorem of  @xcite , interpreted in the present context , is as follows .",
    "if a causal set @xmath4 has the property that , for some fixed @xmath146 , every element is incomparable with at most @xmath146 others , then there is a unique order - invariant measure on @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , this applies to the causal set in example  1 .",
    "more details can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the specific case where @xmath4 is the two - dimensional grid @xmath147 has attracted considerable attention , as it is connected with the representation theory of the infinite symmetric group , and with harmonic functions on the young lattice ( which is the lattice of down - sets of @xmath4 ) . a good account of this theory appears in kerov  @xcite , where a somewhat more general theory is also developed .",
    "our concerns in this paper are different , but the two theories have various points of contact",
    ".    the family of natural extensions of a fixed causal set @xmath4 can also be viewed as the set of configurations of a ( 1-dimensional ) spin system , and order - invariant measures can then be interpreted as _ gibbs measures _ , so that some of the general results discussed in , for instance , bovier  @xcite or georgii  @xcite apply .",
    "in fact , as we shall see later , some of the results in  @xcite apply to order - invariant measures in general .",
    "for a poset @xmath0 and an element @xmath148 , set @xmath149 , the set of elements below @xmath20 .",
    "we also set @xmath150 and @xmath151 to be the set of elements incomparable with @xmath20 .",
    "thus @xmath152 is a partition of @xmath153 .",
    "a causal set is a poset in which @xmath154 is finite for all  @xmath20 .",

    "<S> , we are given a fixed causal set , and we consider random natural extensions of this causal set : we think of the random enumeration as being generated one point at a time . in the other class of processes , </S>",
    "<S> we generate a random causal set , working from the bottom up , adding one new maximal element at each stage .    </S>",
    "<S> processes of both types can exhibit a property called order - invariance : if we stop the process after some fixed number of steps , then , conditioned on the structure of the causal set , every possible order of generation of its elements is equally likely .    </S>",
    "<S> we develop a framework for the study of order - invariance which includes both types of example : order - invariance is then a property of probability measures on a certain space . </S>",
    "<S> our main result is a description of the extremal order - invariant measures .    </S>",
