    "we consider the problem of computing a janet basis of a _ toric _ ideal @xmath0 in @xmath1\\equiv { \\mathbb{k}}[x_1,\\ldots , x_n]$ ] generated by binomials of the form  @xcite @xmath2 here @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the semigroup homomorphism @xmath5 where @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "given a set of binomials generating a toric ideals , the problem of constructing its grbner basis is usually ( except small problems ) rather expensive from the computational point of view  @xcite .",
    "in practice , for this particular problem , one typically deals with a large number @xmath8 of variables and their degrees . if @xmath9 is the maximal degree of the initial binomials , then the degree of a reduced grbner basis is bounded by  @xcite @xmath10 but for all that the reduced grbner basis is also binomial since the binomial structure is preserved during the buchberger algorithm  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the involutive algorithms  @xcite based on the sequential multiplicative reductions of nonmultiplicative prolongations of the intermediate polynomials preserve the binomial structure .",
    "the output involutive basis which is also a grbner basis though generally redundant .",
    "thus , unlike construction of reduced grbner bases or involutive bases for general polynomial ideals , the integer arithmetics which may take most of computing time is not important for binomial ideals . in this case",
    "a fast search of monomial divisors for performing reductions of @xmath11-polynomials may become crucial in acceleration of computations .",
    "recently  @xcite we designed and implemented involutive algorithms specialized to constructing janet bases of monomial and polynomial ideals .",
    "janet division as well as any other involutive division  @xcite provides uniqueness of an involutive divisor in a polynomial set with co - prime leading monomials .",
    "this allows one to organize a very fast search for a janet divisor using special data structures for intermediate polynomial sets called janet trees .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to discuss the issue of practical efficiency in computing janet bases of toric ideals based on the use of janet trees .",
    "since one of the most important applications of toric ideals is integer programming we shortly describe this application  @xcite in the next section .",
    "let @xmath12 be a matrix of dimension @xmath13 with integer entries and @xmath14 , @xmath15 be vectors .",
    "the following optimization problem @xmath16 is called a problem of _",
    "integer programming_.    we shall assume that @xmath17 .",
    "if there exists vector @xmath18 satisfying @xmath19 , @xmath20 , then the problem of finding minimum of function @xmath21 can be reduced to all kinds of transformation of the initial vector state @xmath18 using @xmath22 .",
    "the problem of determining @xmath23 can be formulated in terms of toric ideals .",
    "indeed , every vector @xmath24 may be uniquely represented as @xmath25 where both @xmath26 and @xmath27 are nonnegative and have disjoint support .",
    "associate symbol @xmath28 with the @xmath29-th column of matrix @xmath30",
    ". then the ideal @xmath31 associated with @xmath22 is toric .",
    "given the initial solution @xmath18 , the optimal solution can be found as follows  @xcite :    1 .",
    "construct a basis of the toric ideal @xmath32 .",
    "2 .   construct a reduced grbner basis or an involutive basis of @xmath32 with respect to the admissible monomial ordering @xmath33 generated by vector @xmath34 .",
    "3 .   reduce monomial @xmath35 modulo the constructed basis to obtain the optimal solution .",
    "therefore , the reduced grbner basis or any involutive basis of the associated toric ideal @xmath32 provide an algorithmic tool for solving the problem of integer programming .",
    "in our papers  @xcite the grbner bases of special type , called _ involutive _ and based on the concept of _ involutive division _ were introduced . given a set of coprime monomials and an involutive division",
    ", any monomial may have at most one involutive divisor in the set .",
    "this property of the involutive division allows one to design an efficient search for the involutive divisor using the method of separative monomials  @xcite for a general involutive division or janet trees  @xcite for janet division .    because of a larger number of variables and unimportance of integer arithmetical operations over coefficients of the binomials , the practical complexity of an algorithm for construction of grbner or janet bases is caused by an enormous number of binomials arising in computation of the basis .",
    "a faster search for divisors may accelerates the computation substantially .    by definition of janet division",

    "a janet basis is a grbner one , though generally not reduced .",
    "however , similarly to a reduced grbner basis , a monic minimal janet basis is uniquely defined by an ideal and a monomial order . in",
    "that follows we deal with minimal janet bases only and omit the word `` minimal '' .",
    "consider now a binary janet tree  @xcite whose structure reflects the above partition of elements in @xmath67 into the groups which sorted in the degrees of variables within every group . before description of the general structure of janet trees we explain it in terms of the concrete example  @xcite @xmath68 and portray it in the form of janet tree as shown below . in doing so , the monomials in set @xmath67 are assigned to the leaves of the tree .",
    "the monomial with increased by one degree of the current variable is assigned to the left child whereas the right child points at the next variable with respect to chosen ordering .",
    "in contrast to janet tree presented in paper  @xcite , the below tree takes into account sparseness of monomials that is inherent in toric ideals . the related information is given in pairs of integers placed in brackets where the first element represents the number of current variable and the second one represents its degree .",
    "consider now the structure of janet tree of the general form as a set @xmath69 of internal nodes and leaves which corresponds to a nonempty binomial set . to every element @xmath70 of the tree we shall assign the set of five elements @xmath71 with the following structure : @xmath72 in the absence of a child we shall assign the value _ nil _ to the corresponding pointer . wherever it does not lead to misunderstanding",
    "we shall identify the pointers @xmath73 and @xmath74 with the nodes they point out .",
    "to the root of @xmath75 we assign @xmath76 with @xmath77 in accordance with labeling ( [ order ] ) and @xmath78 .",
    "the internal nodes and leaves of tree @xmath75 are characterized by the states : @xmath79    for a fast search for janet divisor in the given tree one can use the following algorithm * j - divisor * which is an adaptation to the above structure of janet tree of the algorithm described in  @xcite .",

    "let @xmath9 be the maximal total degree of the leading monomials of binomials in @xmath8 variables which constitute the finite set @xmath67 .",
    "then the complexity bound of the algorithm @xmath89 and the binary search algorithm is given by @xmath90    thus , the complexity bound for the search of janet divisor is @xmath91 where @xmath8 is the number of variables and @xmath9 is the maximal degree of the leading monomials in the binomial basis .",
    "since this bound is even lower than that for the binary search algorithm , one can expect that the involutive completion of binomial ideals may be faster than the reduced grbner basis completion .",

    "this tracking of the history in the algorithm allows one to use the involutive analogues of buchberger s criteria to avoid unnecessary reductions .",
    "the set @xmath120 contains those nonmultiplicative variables that have been already used in the algorithm for construction of nonmultiplicative prolongations .",
    "this set serves to prevent repeated prolongations .    in order to provide minimality of the output janet basis we separate  @xcite the whole polynomial data into two subsets which are contained in sets @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "set @xmath121 is a part of the intermediate binomial basis .",
    "another part of the intermediate basis is contained in set @xmath122 together with all the nonmultiplicative prolongations of polynomials in @xmath121 which must be examined in accordance to the above definition  ( [ j_basis ] ) of janet bases . in so doing , after every insertion of a new element @xmath119 in @xmath121 all elements @xmath123 such that @xmath124 are moved from @xmath121 to @xmath122 as the * for*-loop 6 - 11 in algorithm *",
    "binomialjanetbasis * does .",
    "such a displacement guaranties that the output basis is minimal  @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that for any triple @xmath125 the set @xmath120 must always be a subset of the set of nomultiplicative variables for @xmath126 @xmath127 in the description of algorithm * janetbinomialbases * we use the contractions : @xmath128 the insertion of a new polynomial in @xmath121 may generate new nonmultiplicative prolongations of elements in @xmath121 which are added to @xmath122 in line 16 . to avoid repeated prolongations the set @xmath129 of janet",
    "nonmultiplicative variables for @xmath117 has been used to construct its prolongations is enlarged with @xmath130 in line 17 .",
    "the intersection placed in this line preserves the condition ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "the subalgorithms * janetreduce * and @xmath131 perform janet reduction of polynomials in @xmath122 modulo polynomials in @xmath121 and presented below .",
    "in addition to reductions in lines 4 and 19 , the janet normal form computation is placed in line 12 .",
    "this is because the replacement of elements from @xmath121 to @xmath122 may lead to the tail reducibility of the binomial in @xmath119 .",
    "such a reducibility may be caused by converting of some nonmultiplicative variables for binomials in @xmath121 into multiplicative due to the replacement .    in subalgorithm * janetreduce * computation of the janet normal form @xmath60 is done in line 6 for every binomial @xmath126 in @xmath121 . if @xmath60 is nonzero , then line 8 checks if @xmath101 was subjected by reduction .",
    "if the reduction took place @xmath132 can not be multiple of any monomial in the set @xmath133",
    "therefore , one has to insert the triple with @xmath60 in the output set @xmath122 as shown in line 9 as @xmath60 can not have ancestors among polynomials in @xmath121 and one must also examine all nonmultiplicative prolongations of @xmath60 . if @xmath101 is janet irreducible modulo @xmath134 , then the triple @xmath135 is added to @xmath122 in line 11 .",
    "janetreduce(@xmath136 )    @xmath122 and @xmath121 , sets of triples @xmath122 whose polynomials are janet head reduced modulo @xmath121 @xmath137 @xmath138 @xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath141 @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath122    subalgorithm @xmath144 performs the janet reduction of a binomial @xmath145 modulo polynomial set in @xmath121 :    @xmath146    @xmath147 , a triple ; @xmath121 , a set of triples @xmath148 , the janet normal form of the + binomial in @xmath45 modulo binomial set in @xmath121 @xmath149 @xmath150 @xmath151 such that @xmath152 @xmath153 @xmath154 such that @xmath155 @xmath156 @xmath60    for the head reducible input binomial @xmath157 the two criteria are verified in line 5 :    * * criterioni*@xmath158 is true iff @xmath159 .",
    "* * criterionii*@xmath158 is true iff @xmath160 .",
    "these criteria are the buchberger criteria  @xcite adapted to the involutive completion procedure . if any of the two criteria is true , then @xmath161  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the janet normal form is uniquely defined and , hence , uniquely computed by the above subalgorithm .",
    "this uniqueness hold because of the uniqueness of a janet divisor among the leading terms of binomials in @xmath121 at every step of intermediate computations  @xcite .",
    "as we emphasized in sect.3.1 , in the course of involutive completion of the initial binomial generators for a toric ideal the reduction can be performed very fast due to the fast search for a janet divisor , this fast search is provided by the use of the janet tree structures for intermediate binomial set .",
    "our computer experiments with c / c++ codes implementing polynomial algorithms for janet bases  @xcite perfectly strengthen this theoretical fact . in particular",
    "this fast reduction in addition to suppressing swell of intermediate integer coefficients results in high computational speed observed for the benchmark collection used for testing grbner bases software  @xcite .",
    "these benchmarks , however , are not very `` sparse '' with respect to degrees of variables occurring in the generating set . by contrast , the generating binomial sets for toric ideals especially for those arising in integer programming problem are usually highly sparse .",
    "this may lead to much larger cardinality of a janet basis than that of the reduced grbner basis and thereby annihilate the advantages of involutive reduction .",
    "consider the example taken from  @xcite @xmath162 our c++ package  @xcite generates the degree - reverse - lexicographical janet basis of @xmath0 with 7769 binomials whose sorting with respect to the ordering chosen gives @xmath163 where we explicitly show only three highest ranking binomials and the lowest one .",
    "the computing time on a pentium iii 700 mhz based pc running under redhat linux 6.2 is 6 seconds that is noticeably larger than the running time for direct computation of the reduced grbner basis which contains 19 binomials only : @xmath164 accordingly , such a computer algebra system as _ singular _  @xcite needs much less than 1 second to compute this grbner basis on the same computer .",
    "having ascertained this drawback of the involutive method with respect to the grbner basis one in computing toric ideals we designed another algorithmic approach to computing grbner bases  @xcite .",
    "this approach preserves the janet - like tree structure and uniqueness of a divisor though underlying division is not involutive since it does not satisfy the axioms in  @xcite . on the other hand the resulting bases unlike",
    "janet bases are often reduced as grbner bases and their cardinality is always less or equal to the cardinality of janet bases . for toric ideals",
    "the new bases are much more compact then janet bases .",
    "we have not implemented yet the new algorithm and so we demonstrate the compactness of its output in comparison with algorithm * binomialjanetbasis * by the following simple example taken from  @xcite : @xmath165 the reduced grbner basis and janet basis of this toric ideal for the degree - reverse - lexicographic order induced by @xmath166 are @xmath167 and @xmath168 respectively .",
    "their cardinalities are 4 and 11 .",
    "the new basis contains 5 elements @xmath169 and contains only single extra element in comparison with the reduced grbner basis .",
    "it should be noted that there are also a number of other efficient algorithms computing grbner bases of toric ideals ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) which are differ greatly from just completion of a generating binomial set to a grbner basis .",
    "after implementation of our new algorithm we are planning to run the underlying code for collection of large examples given in  @xcite and other references .",
