    "blue stragglers ( bss ) , which have stayed on the main sequence for a time exceeding that expected from standard stellar evolution theory for their masses , are important in population synthesis because of their peculiar properties .",
    "these objects lie above and blueward of the turn - off in the colour  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of a cluster , may contribute remarkably spectral energy in the blue and ultraviolet , and affect the integrated spectrum of the host clusters as they are bright and blue @xcite .",
    "the characters of bss , i.e. luminosity , temperature , gravity etc . , are relevant to their formation mechanism .",
    "there are various possible origins for bss in theory , i.e. close - binary evolution ( mass transfer from a companion or coalescence of both companions ) , stellar collisions ( single - single , binary - single and binary - binary ) , interior mixing , recent star formation etc . @xcite . given the diversity of bss within one cluster , it is likely that more than one formation mechanisms play a role @xcite .",
    "observational evidence shows that binaries are at least important in some cluster bss and in some field bss @xcite .    since the binary mass - exchange hypothesis was originally advanced by mccrea to explain the bs phenomenon , a number of attempts have been made to test the hypothesis in open clusters @xcite .",
    "however there is a lack of detailed binary evolution calculations .",
    "monte - carlo simulations @xcite show that binary coalescence via case a evolution ( mass transfer begins when the primary is on the main sequence ) may be an important source of bss in some clusters while case b evolution ( mass transfer begins when the primary is in hertzsprung gap ) can only account for bss in short - orbital - period binaries .",
    "meanwhile , case a may also produce bss by stable mass transfer as it does not always or immediately lead to a merger .",
    "the difficulty in verifying the binary mass transfer hypothesis is the lack of evidence for variations of radial velocities for most bss .",
    "however some bss have already been confirmed to be in binaries .",
    "a typical example is f190 , a single - lined spectroscopic binary with a 4.2 days period @xcite in the old open cluster m67 .",
    "as well , iue ( international ultraviolet explorer ) spectra @xcite provide evidence that f90 and f131 ( in m67 ) are algol - type mass transfer systems . with the improvement of observational means ,",
    "more and more bss are detected to have variations in radial velocity .",
    "it is therefore necessary to study the hypothesis in detail . as more hydrogen is mixed into the center of an accretor which is still on the main sequence at the onset of roche lobe overflow(rlof ) , the accreting component goes upwards along the main sequence in response to accretion and its time on the main sequence is extended .",
    "when the mass of the accretor is more massive than the corresponding cluster turn - off mass at the age of the cluster , it may be recognized as a bs and show element contamination from the primary on the surface .",
    "the element contamination will effect observational characteristics of the star and it is dependent on the details of the accretion process .",
    "evolution of close binaries has been well studied over the last decades ( see a review of van den heuvel and some recent papers by de loore & vanbeveren , marks & sarna , han et al . , hurley , tout & pols and nelson & eggleton etc . ) .",
    "many of these works are related to the secondary ( initially lower mass component in a binary ) , where accretion mode and accretion rate are concerned on .",
    "since the accreting matter may be originally in the convective core of the primary , thermohaline mixing , which results from accreting material with a higher molecular weight than the surface layers , was first introduced by ulrich to describe this effect ( see also kippenhanhn , ruschenplatt & thomas ) . it was treated as an instantaneous process in intermediate - mass and massive close binaries for its short time scale in these systems by some authors @xcite . as well , the details of accretion process during rlof were ignored in these studies , and we have no knowledge of the effect of composition of secondaries during rlof .",
    "wellstein , langer & braun treated thermohaline mixing in a time - dependent way in massive binary evolution and argued that this is important as both thermohaline mixing and accretion occur on a thermal timescale . in this paper , we concentrate on the behavior of secondaries in low - mass binaries during or just ceasing rlof , applying the results on short - orbital - period bss .",
    "the computations are introduced in section 2 and thermohaline mixing for low - mass close binaries is examined in section 3 .",
    "the results are shown in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we show a best model of f190 by simulation in a complete parameter space .",
    "finally we give our conclusions , discussions and outlook on the work .",
    "we use the stellar evolution code devised by eggleton and updated with the latest physics over the last three decades @xcite .",
    "the rolf is included via the boundary condition    @xmath4,\\ ] ]    when we follow the evolution of the mass donor . here",
    "@xmath5 is the mass loss rate of the primary , @xmath6 is the radius of the star , @xmath7 is the radius of its roche lobe and c is a constant .",
    "here we take @xmath8 so that rlof can proceed steadily and the lobe - filling star overfills its roche lobe as necessary but never overfills it by much , i.e a transfer rate of @xmath9 corresponding to an overfill of 0.1 per cent . when following the evolution of the primary , we store its mass - loss history as an input in subsequent calculations of the secondary , including the age when rlof begins , mass loss rate , and the composition of the lost matter .",
    "the calculation of the secondary is stopped as it overfills its roche lobe and the system becomes a contact binary .",
    "contact binaries are beyond our considerations here for there are many uncertainties during contact phase .",
    "merger models will be studied in another paper .",
    "the accreting matter is assumed to be deposited onto the surface of the secondary with zero falling velocity and distributed homogeneously all over the outer layers .",
    "the change of chemical composition on the secondary s surface caused by the accreting matter is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the mass accretion rate , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are element abundances of the accreting matter and of the secondary s surface for species @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "@xmath15 is the mass of outer most layer of the secondary .",
    "@xmath15 will change with the moving of non - lagrangian mesh as well as the chosen resolution , but it is so small ( @xmath16 ) in comparison with @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) during rlof that we can ignore the effect of various @xmath15 on element abundances . before and after rlof",
    ", we get @xmath19 from the equation , which is reasonable in the absence of mixing .",
    "the opacity table is from opal @xcite with solar composition and from alexander & ferguson in our calculations .",
    "only stable rlofs are considered in our calculations , under which the accreting component may completely accrete the matter lost by the primary as mass transfer is very slow in this case ( @xmath20 , see section 4 ) .",
    "the mass and angular momentum of the systems are therefore assumed to be conservative .",
    "convective overshooting has little effect in the mass range(1.01.6@xmath1 ) we considered @xcite .",
    "we , therefore , have not considered it in our calculations .",
    "during mass transfer in a close binary , the accreting matter may be originally in the convective core of the donor .",
    "it is rich in helium relative to the gainer s surface and has a higher mean molecular weight , which will cause secular instability during or after accretion .",
    "thermohaline mixing will occur in this case .",
    "kippehahn , ruschenplatt and thomas estimated the time scale of the mixing for some massive binaries , in which effects of radiation pressure and degeneracy were considered : @xmath21 here @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 have their usual meanings , @xmath25 is the mean value of @xmath26 in the region of interest , @xmath27 is its distance in depth , @xmath28 is the ratio of gas pressure to total pressure , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the mean free path and velocity of a photon , respectively . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are defined below :      a massive - main - sequence star ( @xmath34 ) with a helium envelope ( @xmath35 ) was examined in that paper .",
    "roughly estimated from a discontinuous model , in which exists a jump from the region of lower mean molecular weight to a higher one , the star has @xmath36 if diffusion extends over the whole radiative envelope .",
    "ulrich obtained a time scale of 400 yrs in a similar case .",
    "thermohaline mixing was then treated as an instantaneous process for intermediate - mass and massive close binaries by some authors in previous studies @xcite .",
    "however the actual time is longer than @xmath37 for some reasons , e.g. , @xmath38 decreases gradually while undergoing thermohaline mixing .",
    "a binary 1.26@xmath39 + 1.00@xmath39 with an initial orbital period of 1.0 day is considered here to examine the effect of thermohaline mixing on low - mass binaries . in a low  mass binary ,",
    "he - rich matter is usually accreted onto the surface of the secondary during the last phase of rlof and the he - rich phenomenon is not very severe in the accreting matter .",
    "the hydrogen mass fraction of the accreting matter is therefore assumed to be @xmath40 and helium mass fraction to be @xmath41 , which is an extreme case for low  mass binaries since hydrogen abundance usually has not reached such a low value .",
    "another remarkable feature for low ",
    "mass binaries is the existence of convective envelope , which may mix the accreting matter into the whole convective envelope very rapidly , minimizing thermohaline mixing in this region .",
    "we therefore show the profile of thermodynamical quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 during rlof in figure [ grad ] to see the change of surface convective region caused by the increase of the mass .",
    "a , b and c represent the mass of the secondary at about 1.00 , 1.12 and @xmath42 , respectively . the helium profile at corresponding masses is also shown in the figure .",
    "thermohaline mixing has not been included in the figure yet ."
