    "the monopole mode shows two concentric ring - shape patterns , which show indeed a monopole - like oscillation .",
    "in fact , emission patterns of the hexapole mode and the monopole mode does not bear perfect six - fold symmetry , e.g. two horizontal lobes look bigger than the others in the case of the hexapole mode .",
    "these discrepancies are due to rectangular grids of the fdtd computation cell which are not well matched with the six - fold symmetric case .",
    "( later , we will explain more in detail . ) along with total intensity ( @xmath86 ) patterns , we also display theta - polarized intensity ( @xmath82 ) patterns and phi - polarized intensity ( @xmath83 ) patterns .",
    "note that such polarization - resolved far - field data can be easily obtained in the real measurement setup ( a solid angle scanner ) by placing a polarizer in front of a photo - detector which scans the whole hemispherical surface.@xcite    first , let us look at the results of the quadrupole mode . comparing with the total intensity power",
    ", it can be deduced that most of the emitted power is theta - polarized .",

    "however , the monopole mode shows opposite result ; phi - polarized emission dominates by @xmath88 .",
    "as indicated by povinelli _",
    ", one may create an artificial magnetic emitter by using the monopole - like mode which shows the same emission characteristics reminiscent of those of the magnetic multipole.@xcite considering that electric ( magnetic ) dipole radiation is theta - polarized ( phi - polarized),@xcite such polarization characteristics seem to be closely related with composition of the electric multipoles and the magnetic multipoles .",
    "thus , the so called multipole decomposition could provide other perspectives for various radiation properties of phc nanocavities along with the plane - wave decomposition ( ft based analyses ) .    from polarization - resolved far - field patterns",

    "the vertical grid resolution @xmath94 was fixed to be @xmath50 throughout the calculation . ]    finally , we would like to mention the origin of the unevenness for the six lobes in the far - field patterns of the hexapole mode and the monopole mode .",
    "these symmetry - breaking comes from the rectangular grid , used in the fdtd computation , which does not fit in the hexagonal symmetry . to check this point ,",
    "we re - calculated the far - field pattern of the hexapole mode with the grid of the finer grid resolution . in this computation , @xmath94 was fixed and only the horizontal grids ( @xmath95 ) were changed .",
    "[ fig : fig6](b ) shows that , by increasing the horizontal grid resolution , the far - field pattern restores the inherent six - fold symmetry .",
    "this comparison confirms that such unbalanced lobes are attributable to the rectangular fdtd grid .",
    "note that even in case of @xmath96 , all important features of the radiation can still be obtained except the slight unevenness .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] are assumed .",
    "one can clearly observe how the hexagonally - distributed pattern is transformed into the directional beaming .",
    "the radiation pattern becomes more directional with the air - hole radius .",
    "when the air - hole radius increment is @xmath100 , the vertical emission looks most favorable . in this case , @xmath101 of the total radiated energy falls within the collection angle of @xmath102 . in other words , @xmath103 of the total emitted photons can be collected from the top .",
    "the downward photons could be re - directed by introducing a reflector underneath . in the next section",
    ", we shall discuss the efficient unidirectional beaming strategy based on the defect tuning and the bottom reflector .",
    "the @xmath4 factors of the proposed hexapole mode are presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig7](c ) .",
    "the exponential decrease of the @xmath4 factor is observed as a function of the detuning parameter ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "note that when the @xmath104 , the @xmath4 factor is still not too bad , @xmath21 20 000 .    since the above modification of two air holes breaks mostly the balance of the @xmath24 field and not that of the @xmath25 field , the directional beaming obtained here will be almost @xmath10-polarized .",

    "therefore , we claim that both the directionality and the linear polarization can be obtained from the hexapole mode by introducing small structural perturbation",

    "note that the @xmath4 factor decreases drastically when the air - gap size becomes less than @xmath114 .",
    "there are two distinct reasons for this phenomenon ; one is the te - tm coupling loss through the phc slab @xcite and the other is the diffraction loss in the downward direction .",
    "the te - tm coupling loss always occurs when the vertical symmetry of the phc slab structure is broken .",
    "the reason for the increase of the diffraction loss to the downward direction is that the light - cone of the bottom substrate is effectively enlarged by a factor of @xmath75 ( the refractive index of the substrate ) .",
    "when the bottom substrate is too close from the slab , the tail of the evanescent field begins to feel the substrate .",

    "the same bottom substrate of index 3.4 is used . here",
    "again , one can see that the original far - field patterns are modified by concentric ring - shape modulations . comparing the patterns of @xmath115 and @xmath116",
    ", one can witness that the similar vertical enhancement is restored after the air - gap is increased by additional thickness of @xmath117 .",
    "this air - gap thickness corresponds to , approximately , a half - wavelength ( @xmath118 ) . at this point , the vertical enhancement condition seems to be summarized as @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the air - gap size and @xmath121 integral multiple .",
    "moreover , the air - gap size of @xmath116 where the good directionality is obtained is approximately equal to one wavelength ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "if one wants to find the rigorous conditions of optimal vertical enhancement , the analyses need to include the effects of the optical thickness of the phc slab and the phase change upon reflection . in the next section , we shall develop a simple , plane - wave based interference model to explain the vertical enhancement conditions . from the @xmath4 factors , one can clearly see , again , the modification of the intrinsic radiation lifetime , where the oscillation period around the dotted line is @xmath123 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig11](b ) ] .",
    "note that there seems to be no definite relation between the @xmath4 factor optimization and the vertical enhancement condition ; the optical loss of the cavity ( @xmath124 ) is a result of the sum of the emitted power ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "a simple guess of the @xmath4 by the emission pattern itself can be misleading .    in principle , one can completely block the downward propagating energy by using a highly - reflective bragg mirror .",
    "for example , a stack of 25 alas / gaas pairs give a reflectivity in excess of 0.998.@xcite in the subsequent analyses , we will use a bragg mirror made of a stack of 20 alas / gaas pairs whose reflectivity is @xmath88 .",
    "remember that the fdtd grid resolution for the @xmath126 direction [ @xmath127 is , in fact , not sufficiently fine to fully describe the each bragg layer ( around 10 grids are used to describe one pair of alas / gaas).@xcite as a result , the reflectivity would be slightly smaller than the actual value .",
    "far - field patterns in presence of a bragg mirror are collectively shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig12](a ) . in comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : fig11](a ) , the concentric ring - shape modulation is more pronounced due to the high reflectivity of the bottom structure . in the @xmath4 factor plot shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig12](b ) , the modification of the radiation lifetime is also prominent .",
    "the maximum @xmath4 factor is increased from @xmath2125 000 to @xmath2135 000 , which represents an increase of the radiation lifetime by @xmath128 in comparison with that without a reflector .",
    "note that , except for such increased interference effects , all other characteristic features in the far - field patterns still remain almost unchanged . in short",
    ", we confirmed that both the radiation lifetime and the radiation pattern can be controlled by simply adjusting the distance between the phc slab and the reflector .",
    "as shown in the far - field pattern of @xmath116 , one can achieve a sharp directional emission in which most of the emitted power ( @xmath129 ) is concentrated within @xmath130 .      in the preceding subsection",
    ", we have shown that , by using the 3-d fdtd method and the near- to far - field transformation algorithm , the radiation patterns of the phc defect modes can be altered by the bottom reflector .",
    "especially the choice of @xmath131 air - gap seems to give the best directional emission . in this subsection , we will try to find conditions for the directionality , by developing a simple analytic model based on plane - wave interferences .",
    "we assume that the phc slab can be approximated as a uniform dielectric slab having an effective refractive index@xcite and the phc resonant mode can be treated as a point dipole source embedded in the middle of the slab and the radiations are described by scalar plane - waves .",
    "we also assume that the bottom reflector is positioned sufficiently far ( @xmath132 ) from the phc slab .",
    "the reflector does not perturb too much the original characteristics of the resonant mode .",
    "thus , the initially upward and downward propagating waves ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig13](a ) ) can be assumed to be symmetric , 1 and 1 .",
    "the downward propagating component will eventually be redirected upward to make an interference with the upward propagating component . although these assumptions seem to be very simple , similar approaches based on the plane - wave interferences",
    "have already been used for the calculation of radiation patterns of atomic dipoles in a planar microcavity.@xcite as indicated by dowling@xcite , the mode structure of the electromagnetic field is a classical phenomenon .    in the simplest case",
    "when multiple reflections between the phc slab and the bottom reflector can be neglected , a constructive inteference condition at the vertical becomes        @xmath133    where @xmath134 is a round - trip phase in the air - gap . @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the phase changes at the bottom reflector at the bragg frequency .",
    "this phase shift is the same with the case of a perfect conducting mirror . ] and through the phc slab , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig13](a ) ) . when the radiation into an angle @xmath80 is considered ,    @xmath137    where @xmath120 and @xmath58 are the air - gap thickness and the slab thickness , respectively .",
    "considering the typical thickness of the phc slab of @xmath138 , one may assume @xmath139.@xcite then , eq .  ( [ eq:4p1 ] ) becomes    @xmath140    this condition is consistent with the previous observation ( @xmath141 ) which has been deduced from the far - field patterns .",
    "however , in general , the phc slab thickness does not satisfy this ` slab resonance condition ( @xmath142 ) ' and the residual reflection can not be completely cancelled .",

    "let @xmath146 be the sum of all the waves detected upward which initially propagate downward .",
    "then , an interference between the originally upward propagating wave and the @xmath146 will be described by @xmath147 , and the resultant intensity will be proportional to @xmath148 . to sum all the waves which undergo infinitely many multiple reflections in the slab and in the air - gap",
