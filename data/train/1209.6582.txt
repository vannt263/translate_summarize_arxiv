    "recently the helium isotopes have extensively studied , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "specifically , elastic scattering of @xmath0he off a polarized proton target has been measured for the first time at an energy of 71  mev / nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the experiment finds that the analyzing power becomes negative around 50@xmath2 , which is not predicted by simple folding models for the optical potential  @xcite , but which nevertheless describe the differential cross section at this energy reasonably well .",
    "this apparent ` @xmath3 problem ' leads to the conclusion that folding models which are adequate in describing p - a scattering from stable , closed shell nuclei need to be revisited and extended when applying them to unstable as well as open - shell nuclei .",
    "[ fig1 ]    the theoretical approach to elastic scattering of a nucleon from a nucleus pioneered by watson  @xcite has been applied very successfully over the years to a wide range of closed shell nuclei . here",
    "a spectator expansion is constructed within a multiple scattering theory predicated upon the idea that the two - body interactions between the projectile and the nucleons in the target dominate the reaction .",
    "generally , only the first order in this expansion is considered , leading to a watson optical potential for single scattering , which is of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a projector on the ground state of the nucleus ( we assume here @xmath0he to have 2 neutrons and protons in the s - shell , and 2 neutrons being in the @xmath6-shell ) , and @xmath7 represents the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) t - matrix evaluated at the energy @xmath8 of the system .",

    "optical potential relies on two basic input quantities .",
    "one is the fully - off - shell nn t - matrix , which represents the current understanding of the nuclear force , and the other is the single particle density matrix of the nucleus under consideration .",
    "the most general form of any nn t - matrix can be written as linear combination of six spin - momentum operators  @xcite as @xmath16   ( \\sigma^{(1 ) } \\cdot { \\hat { \\bf q } } ) ( \\sigma^{(2 ) } \\cdot { \\hat { \\bf q } } ) \\cr & + & \\left [ g ( { \\bf q},{\\bf k } , { \\cal e } ) + h({\\bf q},{\\bf k } , { \\cal e } ) \\right ]   ( \\sigma^{(1 ) } \\cdot { \\hat { \\bf k } } ) ( \\sigma^{(2 ) } \\cdot { \\hat { \\bf k } } ) \\cr & + & d ( { \\bf q},{\\bf k } , { \\cal e } ) \\left [ ( \\sigma^{(1 ) } \\cdot { \\hat { \\bf q } } ) ( \\sigma^{(2 ) } \\cdot { \\hat { \\bf k } } ) + ( \\sigma^{(1 ) } \\cdot { \\hat { \\bf k } } ) ( \\sigma^{(2 ) } \\cdot { \\hat { \\bf q } } ) \\right ] , \\label{eq:3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the amplitude @xmath17 is zero on the energy shell .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    since our goal is to test the effect of the two valance neutrons on the scattering observables rather than to make a detailed comparison with data , we approximate the density matrix for @xmath0he by two harmonic oscillator terms , as is e.g. used for the cosma densities  @xcite , namely a fully occupied @xmath20-shell and two neutrons in the @xmath6-shell .",
    "the oscillator constants are @xmath21  @xmath22 corresponding to a @xmath0he charge radius of 2.054  fm  @xcite and @xmath23  @xmath22 corresponding to a matter radius of 2.32  fm  @xcite .",
    "explicitly , the radial wave functions are given as @xmath24 from which the s - shell and p - shell single particle densities are obtained .",
    "specifically , the p - shell projected on the @xmath25 state is given as @xmath26 where the spin - angular momentum functions are denoted by @xmath27 and the radial part by @xmath28 .",

    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , expectation values of the spin - momentum operators @xmath29 , with @xmath30 , must be taken with all nuclear single - particle wave functions .",
    "if the expectation value is taken with wave functions describing a closed shell , the sum over all nucleons in that shell adds to zero .",
    "thus , for closed shell nuclei only the terms corresponding to the wolfenstein amplitudes @xmath18 and @xmath19 in eq .",

    ", those expectation values contribute the optical potential .",
    "we find by explicit calculation @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the angle between the normal vectors in the nucleon - nucleus ( na ) and nn frame , @xmath34 is the angle between * p * and * p * , and @xmath35 is the angle between the total momentum in the nn frame and the normal in the na frame .",
    "this means that all amplitudes from the nn t - matrix , eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) , contribute to the optical potential when integrated with the single - particle density matrix of the @xmath6-shell neutrons .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath36 has no dependence on the spin of the projectile , @xmath37 , and thus will give an additional contribution to the central part of the optical potential .",
    "all other terms contain a scalar product of @xmath37 with a momentum .",
    "the operator for the amplitude @xmath38 has the typical structure of a spin - orbit operator and only contributes to the spin - orbit potential , while the terms proportional to @xmath39 and @xmath40 contribute to the central as well as to the spin - orbit potential . the explicit integration over the single - particle wave functions for the valence neutrons and the full nn t - matrix of eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) reveals that the integrals involving the amplitudes @xmath41 and @xmath42 give a zero contribution to the optical potential of the valence neutrons .",
    "therefore , the final expression for the optical potential for @xmath0he scattering off protons has the following structure @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the usual optical potential for a closed shell nucleus .",
    "the optical potential due to the valence neutrons acquires additional terms in its central as well as its spin - orbit part , @xmath45",
    "our calculations of the optical potential for @xmath0he scattering off protons are carried out with the harmonic oscillator density given in section  [ sec:1 ] and a nn t - matrix derived from the cd - bonn potential  @xcite .",
    "the wolfenstein amplitudes for neutron - proton ( np ) scattering at 71  mev laboratory kinetic energy are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as function of the np c.m . angle .",
    "the amplitude @xmath18 gives the major contribution to the central term , while the imaginary part of @xmath19 is responsible for the real part of the spin - orbit term .",
    "in addition , the valence neutrons contribute through the @xmath46 amplitude to the spin - orbit term , as well as to the central term through @xmath19 .",
    "since the expectation values of the spin - momentum operators for the neutron in the @xmath6-shell of @xmath0he contain a factor @xmath47 , the forward direction of the amplitudes does not contribute to the optical potential .",
    "the calculations of the angular distributions of the differential cross section and the analyzing power @xmath3 at 71  mev / nucleon and 200  mev / nucleon are shown in fig .",
    "the dash - dotted lines show a ` traditional ' calculation with an optical potential as it would be derived for a closed shell nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the dashed line gives the contribution of the valence neutrons to the central part of the optical potential , while for the solid line their contributions to the cental and the spin - orbit term are added .",
    "all optical potentials are calculated neglecting the target recoil , similar to the calculations in ref .",
    "overall , the additional contributions of the valence neutrons to the optical potential are small . however , they show energy dependence . at 71  mev / nucleon , the contribution to the central term are negligible , only the contribution of from the @xmath46 amplitude to the spin orbit term is visible . at 200  mev / nucleon",
    "both contributions are of the same size , but act in opposite directions so that the net contribution vanishes .",
    "this changes slightly when adding the effect of recoil .",
    "our preliminary calculations show that when including recoil , the effect on the spin - orbit term through the @xmath46 amplitude is slightly enhanced , while the effect due to the additional central term slightly decreases .",
    "this will be discussed in a future manuscript .",
    "in previous work some of the authors investigated the optical potential for @xmath0he derived in a cluster description  @xcite , in which the internal dynamics of @xmath0he as alpha - core plus two neutrons was taken into account explicitly . in this work",
    "it was found that the description of the analyzing power at 71  mev was sensitive to the cluster dynamics .",
    "however , it was also found , that the quality of the optical potential for the alpha - core was important . in principle",
    ", the additional terms due to the open shell structure of the @xmath6-valence neutrons would also have to be included for the two neutrons in the cluster description .",
    "our present work mainly concentrates on taking into account effects related to the dynamics of the @xmath0he nucleus as well as the interaction between the nucleons .",
    "in contrast to that our description of the single - particle density matrix is relatively simple . in a recent work  @xcite a somewhat opposite approach",
    "was taken by deriving an optical potential in the glauber approximation , however employing highly sophisticated wave functions for the @xmath0he nucleus .",
    "it appears that a microscopic understanding of the reaction @xmath0he(p , p)@xmath0he requires considering the dynamics of the reaction as well as the structure of @xmath0he at an equal level of sophistication .",
