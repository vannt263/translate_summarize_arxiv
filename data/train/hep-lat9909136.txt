    "@xmath0 decay phenomenology is a rapidly growing area of particle physics , as we expect that the precise measurements of various @xmath0 meson decays provide rich information of the standard model and the physics beyond it .",
    "following the successful cleo , lep and cdf experiments , the next generation @xmath0 factories ( babar and belle ) have just started operation , and other experimental projects will follow .",
    "lattice qcd may contribute to this program by calculating the @xmath0 meson decay matrix elements starting from the first principles .",
    "its application is extending from the decay constant @xmath1 and bag parameter @xmath2 to various semileptonic decay form factors .",
    "results are being checked by several groups using different lattice formulations of heavy quark , and systematic errors are carefully estimated .",
    "in addition , studies of new applications have been started , such as the zero recoil form factor of @xmath3 , the width difference of @xmath4 meson , and the lifetime ratio of @xmath5 hadrons . in this",
    "talk i review recent developments in such efforts .",
    "this talk is organized as follows . before discussing the matrix elements calculation",
    ", i will summarize recent progress in the lattice determination of @xmath5 quark mass in the next section .",
    "semileptonic decays are discussed in section [ sec : semileptonic_decays ] .",
    "these are divided into two parts : heavy - to - heavy transitions ( @xmath6 , section [ sec : b->dlnu ] ) and heavy - to - light decay ( @xmath7 , section [ sec : b->pilnu ] ) .",
    "i then describe the @xmath8 mixing , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are relevant .",
    "recent unquenched calculations of @xmath1 is summarized in section [ sec : f_b ] , and some updates on @xmath2 is discussed in section [ sec : b_b ] .",
    "finally i will discuss new applications of lattice qcd , which include the calculation of @xmath4 width difference ( section [ sec : b_s_width_difference ] ) and @xmath5-hadron lifetime ratios ( section [ sec : lifeteime_ratios ] ) .",
    "those calculations involve similar matrix elements as in @xmath2 .",
    "a summary of the status as of 1998 was given by t.  draper at the last lattice conference @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath5 quark mass is not a matrix element related to any exclusive decay of @xmath0 meson , it is necessary in the calculation of many inclusive decay rates .",
    "it has become clear , however , that there is an ambiguity in the definition of pole mass of heavy quark itself ( renormalon ambiguity ) , and its determination can not be better than of order @xmath9 @xcite . in order to avoid the ambiguity one has to use a short distance mass definition , such as @xmath10 quark mass @xmath11 .    in the lattice qcd calculation ,",
    "important progress was made by martinelli and sachrajda @xcite , when they obtained the two - loop coefficient in the perturbative matching between continuum qcd and lattice hqet ( static approximation ) @xmath12",
    "\\nonumber\\\\    & & \\times         \\left [ 1-\\frac{4}{3}\\frac{\\alpha_s(\\overline{m}_b)}{\\pi }          -11.66\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(\\overline{m}_b)}{\\pi}\\right)^2        \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is obtained with the `` binding energy '' @xmath14 measured in lattice simulations . in this expression",
    "the perturbative expansion in the first parenthesis matches the energy shift in the lattice hqet to the heavy quark pole mass .",
    "a power divergence exists in the loop integral that cancels with power divergent behavior of nonperturbatively calculated @xmath15 .",
    "the last line connects the pole mass to the @xmath10 mass .",
    "the renormalon ambiguity exists in both of these two expansions , while it cancels between them . with the perturbative expansion to two - loop",
    ", these cancellations are expected to become more precise , making the result more stable .",
    "numerical results with the two - loop matching are very stable among three @xmath16 values ( 6.0 , 6.2 and 6.4 ) as shown in figure [ fig : b - quark_mass ] , where corresponding one - loop results are also plotted with various definitions of the coupling constant .",
    "this result suggests that the cancellation of the power divergence and the renormalon ambiguity is working fairly well at two - loop level .    a dynamical ( @xmath17 ) result along this line has been reported at this conference by the ape collaboration ( v. gimnez @xcite ) , which is shown by a square in figure [ fig : b - quark_mass ] .",
    "their result does not show significant shift from the quenched results .",
    "the nrqcd collaboration presented a @xmath5 quark mass calculation using nrqcd action at lattice 98 @xcite .",
    "they use a one - loop matching between the kinetic mass in nrqcd and the @xmath10 mass , where no power divergence appears in the perturbative calculation and the one - loop coefficient is not large . their results with ( plus ) and without ( stars )",
    "two - flavour dynamical fermions are consistent with the hqet calculations .",
    "the best estimate from the lattice calculations @xmath11 = 4.26@xmath180.11 gev , which i take from the two dynamical results , is in good agreement with recent continuum calculations 4.25(8 ) @xcite , 4.20(6 ) @xcite , 4.20(10 ) @xcite on the @xmath19 resonances , and with delphi s measurement 3.91(67 ) gev at @xmath20 pole @xcite .",
    "the lattice calculation of @xmath0 meson semileptonic decay form factors may be used to determine @xmath21 and @xmath22 with corresponding experimental results of exclusive decays @xmath3 and @xmath23 .",
    "one of the most promising methods to determine @xmath21 is to measure @xmath24 from the differential decay rate of @xmath3 , and extrapolate it to the zero recoil limit of daughter meson @xmath25 , at which the form factor @xmath26 is normalized to unity in the heavy quark mass limit .",
    "theoretical calculations of the power correction to the heavy quark limit have been made using qcd sum rule , but their uncertainty is still quite large ( @xmath27 9% for @xmath28 ) @xcite .",
    "lattice calculation could be an important alternative , if it provides determination better than @xmath29(5% ) .",
    "recently , the fermilab group has proposed a method to calculate the deviation from the heavy quark limit by actually measuring the heavy quark mass dependence of the form factors on the lattice @xcite .",
    "their key observation is that most of statistical and systematic errors cancel in a ratio of matrix elements @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes a zero recoil form factor of @xmath32 decay through a vector current @xmath33 .",
    "the statistical error is less than one per cent for typical values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and thus it is possible to study its mass dependence .",
    "the renormalization factor to match the heavy - heavy current on the lattice to its continuum counter part is perturbatively calculated , depending on the heavy quark mass , and found to be small for the above ratio @xcite .",
    "they fit their data for @xmath36 as well as for @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which are form factors of @xmath39 and @xmath40 modes obtained through similar ratios , with the form of @xmath41 expansion predicted by the heavy quark symmetry @xcite @xmath42 the parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath15 of @xmath45 terms are determined with the fit .",
    "their preliminary result for @xmath46 form factor obtained at @xmath16=5.7 is @xmath47 = 0.935(22)(@xmath48)(8)(20 ) , where errors represent statistical , mass determination , perturbative and unknown @xmath49 in the given order @xcite .",
    "the systematic error associated with the fermilab formalism of heavy quark @xcite is a subtle issue , especially because the @xmath50 terms in the effective hamiltonian are not correctly tuned with the use of the clover action , while the correction to be measured is of @xmath45 .",
    "nevertheless , using the @xmath41 expansion , it is generally shown that only @xmath51 terms in the action and currents contribute to the ratios calculated above , and thus the systematic error is well under control @xcite .",
    "the result is consistent with the recent qcd sum rule calculation 0.89@xmath180.08 @xcite , and the estimated error is already slightly smaller , demonstrating a possibility to improve the determination of @xmath21 using the lattice calculation in near future .      in recent high statistics experiments ,",
    "the extrapolation to the zero recoil limit without theoretical constraints seems good enough @xcite .",
    "it is , however , informative to compare the shape of form factors with theoretical predictions in order to check the reliability of the extrapolation , and also to check the theoretical methods .",
    "two new calculations of heavy - to - heavy form factors ( isgur - wise function ) have been presented by ukqcd @xcite and by hein _",
    "@xcite at this conference .",
    "ukqcd used the non - perturbatively @xmath52-improved action at @xmath16=6.0 and 6.2 , and calculated @xmath53 form factor @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "they found no significant dependence on the heavy quark mass , and their preliminary result for the slope parameter is @xmath55 = 1.10(@xmath56)(@xmath57 ) and 1.12(@xmath58)(@xmath59 ) at @xmath16=6.0 and 6.2 , respectively .",
    "the precision is the best among previous results @xcite , and the scaling with two lattice spacings is remarkable .",
    "hein _ et al .",
    "_ presented a very preliminary study with a nrqcd action at @xmath16=5.7 @xcite .",
    "form factor @xmath54 is obtained for @xmath60 and also for @xmath61 mode , where @xmath62 denotes a radially excited state of @xmath63 meson .",
    "perturbative matching factors recently calculated by boyle @xcite are incorporated for heavy - heavy ( axial-)vector currents .",
    "exclusive semileptonic decays @xmath64 could be used for the determination of @xmath22 , provided that corresponding form factors are theoretically calculated .",
    "unfortunately , in the lattice simulations , it is difficult to put large recoil momentum on the daughter meson , so that momentum transfer squared @xmath65 is restricted in the large @xmath65 region ( small recoil momentum ) .",
    "the lattice calculations can be , however , still useful , if statistics in the experiment is precise enough to measure the partial decay rate for the large @xmath65 region , and such work has already been done by cleo for @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "there are two form factors @xmath67 and @xmath68 involved in @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath68 has a negligible contribution to the physical decay rate , as it is proportional to the lepton mass .",
    "it is , however , interesting to study @xmath68 , since the soft pion theorem relates @xmath70 to @xmath1 , which may be used for a test of the lattice calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "the calculation of @xmath67 is of practical importance , as it is directly related to the physical decay rate and may be used for a precise determination of @xmath22 of @xmath71 .",
    "based on the lsz reduction formula and current algebra , the soft pion theorem predicts @xmath72 in the limit @xmath73 and @xmath74 , thus @xmath75 .",
    "it was pointed out by onogi at lattice 97 that the lattice results for @xmath70 and @xmath1 do not seem to satisfy this relation @xcite .",
    "the inconsistency has become even clearer with new data as shown in figure [ fig : soft_pion ] , in which i plot currently available results for @xmath76 ( with renormalization group correction ) , comparing them with representative data for @xmath77 .",
    "the heavy quark scaling law predicts both quantities should be constant , up to @xmath78 corrections .",
    "possible cures for this problem have been proposed at this conference : nonperturbative renormalization and a method of chiral and @xmath65 extrapolation , which i discuss in the following .",
    "the jlqcd collaboration has calculated a ratio of renormalization factor @xmath79 nonperturbatively , using the chiral ward identity @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the light - light axial - current and pseudoscalar density defined on the lattice , and @xmath83 represents the renormalization factor for @xmath81 available nonperturbatively @xcite .",
    "@xmath84 and @xmath85 are temporal component of heavy - light vector and axial - vector currents , which appear in the definition of @xmath70 and of @xmath1 respectively .",
    "their simulation method follows that of maiani and martinelli @xcite , while they use @xmath52-improved action and current for light quark and static heavy quark action .",
    "a preliminary result for the static - light currents at @xmath16=6.0 , @xmath79=0.72(1 ) , is significantly smaller than the one - loop value 0.86(4 ) .",
    "this result indicates that the one - loop calculation of the renormalization factor of the static - light current may contain a large systematic error ( @xmath27 20% ) , and suggests larger @xmath70 and/or smaller @xmath1 in the static limit , which gives right direction to satisfy the soft pion relation , but magnitude is not enough .",
    "an ongoing study to calculate @xmath86 nonperturbatively using the scrdinger functional method has also been presented at this conference by kurth and sommer @xcite .",
    "ukqcd has pointed out that a term proportional to @xmath87 is necessary in the chiral extrapolation as well as the usual @xmath88 term @xcite .",
    "that dependence appears solely from the @xmath87 dependence of @xmath89 : @xmath90 . as a result",
    "the chiral extrapolation could be subtle , since @xmath87 and @xmath88 behave similarly in the region where simulations are made . in order to remove @xmath87 term",
    "they interpolate @xmath68 to several fixed @xmath65 values for each of the active and spectator light quark masses .",
    "then , the chiral extrapolation can be done at each fixed @xmath65 with the @xmath88 term only .",
    "the range of available @xmath65 for all light quark mass is substantially lower than the physical @xmath89 , so they employ a pole dominance model and @xmath91 when they fit with dipole - pole ansatz @xcite or with becirevic - kaidalov model @xcite .",
    "the functional form of @xmath68 are pole - type in both models . ] to obtain the physical @xmath70 from data points .",
    "this extrapolation to the physical @xmath89 makes @xmath70 significantly high 1.3(@xmath92)(@xmath92 ) , which is consistent with @xmath93=1.35(@xmath94)(@xmath95 ) .",
    "although it is a nice observation , the method is , to some extent , model dependent .",
    "therefore , a cross check seems necessary with the direct extrapolation method including @xmath87 and @xmath88 terms , which requires high statistics data at several ( active and spectator ) light quark masses .",
    "milc collaboration have started such a study using fatlink clover quark action for both heavy and light quarks on their dynamical quark configurations @xcite .",
    "they presented a very preliminary result that soft pion theorem is satisfied when extrapolated including @xmath87 term albeit with a large error .",
    "model independent calculation of @xmath67 has great phenomenological importance , since the differential decay rate @xmath96 is proportional to @xmath97 and its measurement may be used for the determination of @xmath22 .    near @xmath98 , where lattice calculation is most powerful",
    ", the pole dominance picture should give a good approximation , as the corresponding pole of @xmath99 meson is very close .",
    "using the @xmath100 coupling @xmath101 and @xmath99 meson decay constant @xmath102 , defined by @xmath103 the form factor @xmath67 is given by @xmath104 up to the contribution of higher excited states , which is relatively small for large @xmath65 .",

    "several new applications have also been studied , such as the width difference of @xmath4 meson , and the lifetime ratios of @xmath5 hadrons . those will become useful theoretical calculations , provided that statistical and systematic errors are improved .",
