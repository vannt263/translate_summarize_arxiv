    "it is well known @xcite,@xcite that during stellar collapse , the final mass of the homologously collapsing core and the strength of the subsequent type ii supernova shock is determined by the final electron fraction of the core @xmath3 .",
    "the latter , in turn , is influenced by the electron captures ( and @xmath0-decays ) taking place on the nuclei present in the core during it s hydrostatic evolution , kelvin - helmholtz contraction and dynamic collapse phases .",
    "this can be seen from the scaling relations @xcite,@xcite for the mass of the homologously collapsing core and for the shock energy when the core bounces at supernuclear densities:- @xmath4 and @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the mass and radius of the homologously collapsing core .",
    "the electron - captures and @xmath0-decays also determine the physical conditions in the ( quasi- ) hydrostatically evolving core through their influence on the entropy per nucleon @xmath8 .",
    "this is because a low value of @xmath8 implies that ( a ) the number of free protons is smaller and ( b ) the nuclei are excited generally to low energy states .",
    "since the core loses energy ( through neutrino emission ) mainly by electron captures on free protons , as a consequence of ( a ) , the electron fraction @xmath9 remains high leading to a more massive homologously collapsing core and subsequently a more energetic shock .",
    "further , since the collapse is essentially adiabatic and the nuclei have low excitation energies , the low value of @xmath8 ensures that the number of drip nucleons is very small , i.e. the nucleons remain inside the nuclei right until the core reaches nuclear density .",
    "thus since the number of free nucleons is low , the collapse proceeds to higher densities leading to a stronger bounce shock .",
    "for all these reasons , to make a realistic model of the physical conditions prevailing in the core of a type ii supernova progenitor , it is necessary to know the weak interaction rates of a number of nuclei at the relevant energies .    in general ,",
    "the energy dependence of weak interaction matrix elements ( or equivalently , the gamow - teller ( g - t ) strength distribution ) is unknown for many nuclei of potential importance in pre - supernova stars and collapsing cores .",
    "however for the few nuclei of interest for which the experimental data is available , it is possible to map out the energy distribution of the gt strength in terms of a few shape parameters .",
    "these parameters can be related to nuclear properties like the nuclear isospin and the mass number and a corresponding approximate distribution can be constructed for any nucleus of astrophysical interest in that nuclear shell .",
    "we consider here nuclei in the f - p shell since in the post - silicon - burning phase the core of a pre - supernova massive star has a significant abundance of these neutron rich nuclei with @xmath10 . in e@xmath11-capture and @xmath0-decay calculations relevant to the pre - supernova scenario ,",
    "it is not particularly important to consider the higher shells ( though this is not the case during the collapse phase , where at sufficiently high density they may have non - negligible abundances ) .",
    "this is because neutron shell blocking @xcite ( which starts at around @xmath12ge ) substantially decreases the e@xmath11-capture rate for these heavier nuclei and their contribution to the collective electron capture rates is small compared to that of mid f - p shell nuclei , if the latter is present with sufficient abundances .",
    "the importance of knowing the centroid of the gt distribution ( @xmath1 ) lies with the fact that it determines the effective energy of the e@xmath11-capture and @xmath0-decay reactions from e.g. the ground state of the initial nucleus to the excited state of the final nucleus , and this along with the electron- fermi energy determines which nuclei are able to capture electrons from , or @xmath0-decay onto the fermi - sea at a given temperature and density  thus controlling the rate at which the abundance of a particular nuclear species would change in the pre - supernova core .",
    "for example , the following expression holds for the @xmath13-decay rates of the discrete states of the mother nucleus ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath14 f(q_i - e^{\\prime})de^{\\prime}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the axial - vector and vector coupling constants respectively and the @xmath18 are the corresponding fermi and gt matrix elements .",
    "@xmath19 is the energy of the @xmath20 level of the mother having spin @xmath21 , and q - value @xmath22 .",
    "the function @xmath23 is the phase - space factor , integrated over electron - energies ( in units of @xmath24 ) from 1 to @xmath25 .",
    "( 1 ) shows that the distributions of the transition strengths in energy are important in the rate calculations .",
    "the @xmath0-decays can take place either through the fermi ( vector ) type interaction or the gamow - teller ( axial - vector ) type interaction while the e@xmath11-captures on a nucleus in ground state involves only the gt interaction .",
    "the gt operator @xmath26 does not commute with the strong spin , isospin dependent forces of the nuclear hamiltonian , which causes a mixing of states in both the spin as well as isospin space . while the effect of mixing in the isospin space is small ( because of the relatively weaker coulomb potential term ) , the mixing of states in the spin - space gives rise to a broad distribution of the total gt strength in excitation energies known as the gamow - teller giant resonance ( gtgr ) which contains a large fraction of the total weak - interaction strength sum .",
    "in contrast , the fermi strength is concentrated in a narrow region of excitation energies because the fermi operator commutes with all parts of the nuclear hamiltonian except the coulomb part . at temperatures and densities ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) characteristic of the presupernova core , the main contribution to the weak interaction rates is expected to come from the gtgr region .    in sections  [ sec : gtstrength ] and  [ sec : gtcentroid ] we use the available data on nuclear charge - exchange reactions on mid fp - shell nuclei to characterise the gt strength distribution for arbitrary nuclei of astrophysical interest . in section",
    "[ sec : comp ] we compare our results with other theoretical methods , namely the m1 method used by klapdor @xcite and the method of fuller , fowler and newman @xcite . in section  [ sec : cconst ] we discuss the implications of the observed gt energy systematics vis -  - vis the bohr - mottelson two body hamiltonian and in section  [ sec : concl ] we give our conclusions .",
    "it is well known @xcite,@xcite that the information on charge exchange reactions in nuclei can be used to extract the gt strength distributions with respect to the excitation energy of the daughter nucleus . the charge - exchange ( p , n ) and ( n",
    ", p ) reactions are iso - spin and spin - dependent over a wide range of projectile energies .",
    "the weak interaction strength distribution ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) is propotional to the @xmath31 , forward scattering cross - section in the high projectile energy , low momentum transfer limit .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the corresponding operators @xcite:- @xmath32 which are similar to : @xmath33 the @xmath31 scattering cross - section for various mid - fp shell target nuclei undergoing ( p , n ) and ( n , p ) reactions are reported in ref .",
    "@xcite to @xcite .",
    "these cross - sections are extracted out of the @xmath34 spectrum by means of multipole analysis using distorted wave impulse approximation calculations ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the cross - sections can be analysed to obtain the experimental distribution of gt strength in energy to a reasonably good accuracy by using known calibration relations ( e.g. the relation developed in @xcite ) and this method has been widely used in the literature @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the calculation of the weak - interaction mediated reactions under the astrophysically relevant conditions requires the knowledge of not only the total strength in a given direction ( e.g. @xmath13-decay or e@xmath11-capture ) but also that of the strength distribution in nuclear excitation energy .",
    "attempts have been made to obtain these distributions theoretically from shell - model calculations .",
    "however , the number of shell - model basis states can get very large for mid - fp shell nuclei , even at low energies .",
    "hence the direct method of obtaining gtgr distribution from shell model calculation using full @xmath35 basis is computationally very involved even for a few nuclei .",
    "several attempts to calculate the gt distribution from direct shell model calculations using a truncated shell model basis space have also been made , ( e.g. aufderheide et al .",
    "@xcite ) which because of the above reasons , despite substantial computational efforts , are as yet approximate .",
    "we note that complete fp - shell @xmath36 _ monte carlo _ calculations have been mentioned recently which show significant quenching ( discussed later ) , and have reportedly reproduced the experimentally observed strength in nuclei such as @xmath37cr , @xmath37fe , @xmath38mn and @xmath39fe but not in @xmath40ni , the result being sensitive to the interaction hamiltonian assumed ( see koonin and langanke @xcite and references therein ) . in any case",
    "the calculation of the weak interaction mediated reaction rates for a moderately large number of nuclei required in astrophysical situations requires a straightforward and computationally manageable approach . here , following an earlier work @xcite we use the framework of a statistical approach , as in the spectral distribution theory @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the sum rule strength for a transition from an initial state @xmath41 to a final state @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 on the single particle level , if @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the fractional occupancies of the neutrons in @xmath46 level and protons in @xmath47 level , then the gt sum rule ( e.g. for @xmath48-decay ) is given by the expression : @xmath49 where @xmath50^{1/2}w(l { 1 \\over 2 } j 1 ; j^ { ' } { 1 \\over 2})$ ] , and w is the racah coefficient .",
    "the occupation numbers @xmath44 , @xmath51 etc . in a given shell",
    "can be calculated with the spectral distribution theory ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite )    for the distribution of the strength with the nuclear excitation energy we note that the according to the spectral distribution theory , for a many particle space of large dimensionality , the smoothed - out eigenvalue distribution of a ( 2 + 1 ) body hamiltonian is approximately a gaussian . a skewed gaussian ( called the edgeworth expansion ) of the form : @xmath52 \\exp(-x^2 / 2 ) } \\ ] ]    where @xmath53 is used here .",
    "the parameters @xmath54 ( the skewness factor ) , @xmath1 ( the energy centroid ) , @xmath55 ( the effective half - width ) and @xmath56 ( normalisation factor ) are obtained for each daughter nucleus by fitting the above formula to the experimentally obtained strength distribution .",
    "it is known that if the total strength in the @xmath57 direction is small , the observed value of the total gamow - teller strength in the @xmath58 direction is , on the average , approximately @xmath59 of the theoretically predicted value of @xmath60 ( for the nuclei studied here , it is observed to vary between 45 to @xmath61 ) .",
    "this quenching of gt strength given by the factor @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) above is expected to be due to the excitation of @xmath63-isobars at higher excitation energies through @xmath64 transitions , or the missing gt strength may lie at higher excitations ( between 30 mev to 50 mev ) @xcite . on the other hand in the electron capture direction ,",
    "the total gt strength sum ( i.e. @xmath65 ) in the f - p shell has been argued to depend on the number of valance protons and the number of neutron holes in the fp shell ( koonin and langanke , 1994 ) . according to these authors",
    "the _ total _ @xmath66 strength observed experimentally in the mid - fp shell nuclei can be fitted by an expression like : @xmath67 as argued by them , in the electron capture direction for nuclei having @xmath68 , the number of possible transitions are limited by the number of available neutron holes and the number of protons in the full f - p shell .",
    "they also suggest that the neutron - proton correlations throughout all of the f - p shell are important in reproducing the observed quenching , and mid - fp shell nuclei in this sense behave as though there is only one large shell in which all subshell structure has been diluted .",
    "the above expression includes the observed quenching and can therefore be used to independently fix @xmath62 for the sum - rule for electron capture in an equation similar to eq .",
    "( 2 )    for reasons discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] and the beginning of this section , astrophysical calculations require , apart from the total @xmath57 strength itself ( such as given above ) , it s distribution in energy  which is characterised by higher moments of the distribution such as the energy centroid e@xmath69 , the skewness of the distribution , etc . with the objective of generating the @xmath70 distribution of any arbitrary nucleus ( a , z ) of potential astrophysical importance ,",
    "we now make use of the experimentally available data . the @xmath71 and @xmath72 distributions obtained from analysis of charge exchange experiments are least - square fitted to the edgeworth expression discussed above , under the constraint that the total ` experimental ' gt strength is reproduced by the area under the fitted expression .",
    "the edgeworth expansion gives a good fit in the cases of @xmath73v , @xmath74br , @xmath75ga and @xmath76ni . in the case of @xmath40ni ( target nucleus ) , the resonance region between 7.5 and 12 mev",
    "is fitted well by the edgeworth expression .",
    "similarly for @xmath37fe , the fit is reasonably good between 6 to 12 mev . for these nuclei",
    ", the strength fluctuates rapidly at low excitation energy , suggesting that at these energies single particle transitions dominate over collective resonance .",
    "since spectral distribution theory is based on a statistical description of a large number of basis states , it is not expected that the edgeworth expansion will reproduce the fluctuating strengths at low energies due to single particle transitions . nevertheless for the g - t collective resonance region ( which is important because of the bulk of the total strength being accessible at energies relevant to the astrophysical situation ) , the spectral distribution theory approach is useful .",
    "finally , since for @xmath39fe , @xmath37fe , @xmath40ni , @xmath76ni , only the @xmath77 ( p , n ) cross - section is reported in ref @xcite , the calibration relation based on the factorised dwia expression for @xmath78 differential cross - section as developed in @xcite was used to convert the reported cross - section to @xmath79 .",
    "table 1 gives the edgeworth parameters for each of these fits .",
    "a typical fit of @xmath30 per @xmath80 mev interval ( for @xmath75ga ) is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the data used in these fits came from refs .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath81fe , @xmath82ni ) , @xcite ( @xmath74br ) , @xcite ( @xmath73v ) and @xcite ( @xmath75ga ) .",
    "the edgeworth parameters for @xmath71 per mev vs. @xmath83 fits are tabulated in table  [ tab : edge+ ] .",
    "2 shows the distribution and fit for @xmath84co .",
    "the distribution is well reproduced for the low energy region and the main gtgr peak . for this set of results the data was obtained from refs .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath37fe ) , @xcite ( @xmath39fe , @xmath40ni , @xmath38mn ) , @xcite ( @xmath73v , @xmath84co ) , @xcite ( @xmath85ge ) . for @xmath85ge , vetterli et al .",
    "@xcite quote the value of @xmath29 upto 7.6 mev only , because of the difficulty of extraction of the @xmath86 component from the ( p , n ) cross- section .",
    "the parameters for this nucleus reported in table  [ tab : edge+ ] are obtained on the basis of the strength upto 7.6 mev only . in some cases the single - particle transitions may dominate in either direction at low excitation energy , and so wherever they are known experimentally , these should be used explicitly in the transition rate calculations .",
    "we refer to the centroids of the @xmath87 distributions obtained by making edgeworth fits to those reported from the ( p , n ) and ( n , p ) experiments as the ` experimental centroids ' . in order to be able to predict such an energy distribution for any relevant f - p shell nucleus",
    ", we relate the shape - parameters for @xmath88 distributions to nuclear properties like the nuclear ground - state isospin , and the mass number . here",
    "we report the relation developed for the energy centroid @xmath1 , which can be applied to arbitrary nuclei of astrophysical interest for rate calculations .",
    "the gt@xmath90 operator is a space vector and an isovector , and the selection governing this transition require that @xmath91 , @xmath92 ( no @xmath93 ) and @xmath94 . since the fermi operator is a pure isovector , the selection rules require that @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , i.e. transitions take place only between isobaric analog states ( ias ) . for both fermi and allowed gt transitions @xmath98 . it has been argued ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) that under the action of resonant gt or fermi operators , the collective states have centroids located at @xmath99 and @xmath100 with respect to the appropriate , unperturbed state such that the difference @xmath101 should depend on the spin - orbit splitting term ( @xmath102 ) , and on the isospin dependent lane potential term ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the latter gives the energy difference between two levels having the same @xmath104 , but differ in @xmath105 by a one unit .",
    "the excitation energy of the isobaric analog state @xmath100 ( where the fermi centroid is located ) is obtained in our analysis , either experimentally ( where available ) , or from the following theoretical relation developed by fowler and woosley and reported in ref @xcite for neutron rich nuclei : @xmath106 with @xmath107 here @xmath108 is the mass excess of the initial nucleus , @xmath109 is the mass excess of the final nucleus , and r is the radius in fm .",
    "this is observed to agree very well with the experimental data used in this work ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . fitting a linear combination of the spin - orbit and isospin dependent terms to the experimental centroids , @xmath99 for the ( p , n ) reaction data , we get the following empirical relation : - @xmath110 the correlation between the theoretical @xmath111 obtained from ( 4 ) ( together with the experimental values of e@xmath112 reported in the references given earlier ) , and the experimental gt@xmath113 centroids as referred to above is shown in fig .",
    "it is noted that a similar relation derived earlier @xcite ( also in @xcite ) using data for nuclei well beyond f - p shell had the corresponding coefficients differ substantially from those obtained in eq .",
    "( 4 ) for the f - p shell nuclei .",
    "the reason for this difference is discussed in section  [ sec : cconst ] .",
    "the goodness of the fit is measured in terms of the rms deviation from the experimental value and is evaluated to be 0.43 mev . as it is apparent from table  [ tab : ffncomp ] and fig .",
    "4 , the gt@xmath11 centroids are located roughly between 9 to 11 mev .",
    "this , together with the expected thermal spread of the electron fermi distribution at temperatures relevant in the presupernova core ( typically @xmath114 ) , and a @xmath115 mev would make a typical error of the order of 0.43 mev in the predicted centroid quite acceptable for astrophysical rate calculations .      since in the n - p reaction there is a transition from a parent nuclear ground - state having isospin @xmath116 to a daughter state having minimum isospin @xmath117 ( for g.s .",
    "transition ) , there can be no ias state in the daughter corresponding to the ground state of the mother for the electron capture or the @xmath57 direction .",
    "thus , @xmath118 has to be obtained directly ( in contrast to @xmath101 in the @xmath58 direction ) and can be expected to depend on the spin - orbit splitting term , the lane potential term and , for odd - a nuclei on the pairing energy term as well .",
    "electron - capture / e@xmath119-emission on a nucleus generally raise the final nucleus to an excited state .",
    "the single - particle excitation configurations of most of these excited states can be constructed from its ground state by breaking either a proton or a neutron pair and raising a single particle to an excited level or by raising an unpaired single particle ( if available ) to a excited state .",
    "for odd - even / even - odd nuclei , the excited states of the final even - odd / odd - even nuclei ( which are connected to ground state of the parent nucleus by @xmath57 transitions ) , can be generated from the g.s .",
    "of the final nucleus by breaking a particle pair in lower energy level and using it to create an unpaired particle in a higher energy level or to pair off a previously unpaired particle in a higher energy level and simultaneously raise another single particle to the excited state .",
    "for an odd - odd / even - even initial nucleus , however , the excited states in the final even - even/ odd - odd nucleus will be generated by breaking and making a particle pair .",
    "this implies that the energy required to break a pair in the final odd a nucleus must also be included in any expression for @xmath57 energy systematics .",
    "fitting the experimental @xmath120 centroids ( obtained from the edgeworth weighted experimental @xmath71 distributions ) to a linear combination of these terms , we arrive at the following empirical relation for @xmath121 centroid with respect to the ground state of the final nucleus : @xmath122 the plot of @xmath118 from ( 5 ) vs. the experimental centroid is shown in fig .",
    "5 . the goodness of fit in fig . 5",
    "is also measured in terms of the r.m.s .",
    "deviation from the experimental value , and has the value 0.31 mev .",
    "the nuclei used in both figures are stated in the order of increasing @xmath1(experimental ) .",
    "we note that koonin and langanke ( 1994 ) suggest that the gt - resonance appears in ( n , p ) spectra at systematically higher energies for odd - z targets than for even - z targets , although this is based on data involving target nuclei with even number of neutrons . on the basis of single particle excitation diagrams for the final nucleus , conforming to g - t selection rules for a transition from the initial to the final nucleus , we find that the pairing energy dependence in terms of odd - a in eq .",
    "( 5 ) ( the last term ) would be present even in odd - n , even - z nuclei .",
    "the average difference of experimental and predicted values of 0.4 mev in @xmath99 and 0.3 mev in the case of @xmath120 can be mitigated by the spread in the electron fermi - dirac distribution due to the 0.5 mev temperature and also due to the fact that in a given region of the star at a particular stage of evolution there are several nuclear species present in the stellar material simultaneously .",
    "the total transition rate of this large admixture of nuclei is likely to be dominated in a given stage and region by a few nuclear species , with relatively large transition rates and abundances .",
    "these would necessarily have large energies of transition and would in any case consume a substantial fraction of the strength sum rule .",
    "thus for astrophysical purposes , the level of accuracy of the predictions for the gt@xmath90 centroids obtained here are expected to be adequate .",
    "data for @xmath123sc and @xmath124ti are also available in references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , we have not used these two nuclei in obtaining eq.(5 ) and fig . 5 , partly because these nuclei are close to the beginning of the fp - shell where the general assumptions of the statistical nature of the spectral distribution theory may not be valid .",
    "for this reason , the calculation of the edgeworth weighted centroid of the experimental b@xmath125 distribution gives inaccurate results because of the low energy strength .",
    "indeed , if these nuclei were to be included in fig .",
    "3 , the goodness of fit would have decreased to an r.m.s .",
    "value of 1.37 mev .",
    "similarly , we had to ignore the data for @xmath126zr @xcite because the @xmath127 shell is occupied in this nucleus . effectively , it can be said that eq .",
    "( 5 ) is valid for mid - fp - shell nuclei with @xmath128 .",
    "while a detailed shell model calculation for these nuclei requires a very large number of basis states and would be difficult to carry out for each of these nuclei , it is conceivable that a reasonably good estimate of the gt excitation energy centroids by using either the m1 excitation method ( for the @xmath57 excitation ) or the ffn method ( for the @xmath58 excitation ) .",
    "these methods are described in detail in ref .",
    "the predictions of these methods are compared with the results obtained in this paper in the following paragraphs and in table  [ tab : ffncomp ] and table  [ tab : m1comp ] .    in the ffn method ,",
    "the gt transition in @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) direction , which can be either the spin - flip ( sf ) or the no - spin - flip ( nsf ) transition , is reproduced by taking into account all possible excitation of a p(n ) in the parent nucleus to a sf or nsf orbital ( for which @xmath129 ) and then converting the p(n ) to n(p ) via the @xmath130(@xmath131 ) operator .",
    "the gt excitation energy for that transition is given by the sum of the excitation energies with respect to the ground state of the daughter nucleus together with the lane potential energy and if required , the pairing energy term .",
    "the gt centroid energy with respect to the ground state of the daughter nucleus is given by the weighted average of all these sf and nsf transitions .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "6 , the ground state of ( g.s . ) @xmath73v is connected to the g.s .",
    "of @xmath73cr by a nsf-@xmath131 transition , and to an excited state by a sf-@xmath131 transition .",
    "for the former transition , the gt excitation energy ( measured , as always , with respect to the ground state of @xmath73cr ) equals the lane potential ( @xmath132 ) , which is evaluated as 4.90 mev .",
    "the square of the gt matrix element for this transition is 6.42 . for the latter transition , the gt",
    "excitation energy is the sum of single - particle excitation energies ( 6.66 mev ) , the lane potential ( 4.90 mev ) and pairing energy ( 1.68 mev ) , while the square of the transition matrix element is 13.71 . here",
    ", the sf transition has the maximum contribution to the total strength and this is observed to be the norm in the case of other nuclei considered in ref.@xcite as well .",
    "thus , from this single particle excitation method , the @xmath58 centroid can be expected to lie at 10.58 mev .",
    "the experimental centroid lies at 11.75 mev .",
    "however , as this method does not take into account the collective particle - hole excitations @xcite of the nucleus ( where a good fraction of the total strength can be expected to lie ) , it should not be expected to yield the experimental @xmath1 precisely .",
    "this is a purely theoretical method , and the excitation energies are calculated from single - particle shell model energy levels @xcite . for the single particle levels of neutron we have used the sequenece and values labelled as  seeger \" in ref @xcite .",
    "although for the protons , the  seeger \" sequence lists 2p@xmath133 higher than 1f@xmath134 , since the observed ground state spins of @xmath135cu , @xmath136cu etc ( where there is one extra proton beyond the 1f@xmath137 level ) contradict this sequencing ( i.e. the g.s .",
    "j@xmath138 for these nuclei is ( 3/2)@xmath113 and not ( 5/2)@xmath113 ) , following an earlier work @xcite we adopt the same values for the proton single particle energy differences as in the case of neutrons in this work unless specifically mentioned otherwise .",
    "now , it is seen from the selection rules that most of the gt strength for nuclei with @xmath139 lie in the spin - flip transitions .",
    "experimentally too , it is observed that the sf transition strength is more concentrated than the nsf transition strength . for the sf transitions ,",
    "the action of the gt operator is equivalent to a s - f transition followed by an isospin - flip ( m1 transition from the mother to the daughter ) .",
    "if we consider a @xmath140 to @xmath141 transition , to find @xmath118 in the daughter by the m1 method , we need to consider the m1-@xmath131 transition from the daughter to the mother nucleus .",
    "the m1 method for finding the @xmath57-centroid in the neutron rich daughter nucleus ( see e.g. @xcite ) is based on the observation that most of the gt sf - configuration strength is concentrated near the anti - isobaric analog state ( aias ) of the m1 giant resonance  the so called m1-aias state .",
    "now , the predominant configuration in the m1-aias state in the daughter is the spin - flip configuration generated from a @xmath140 mother ground state by transforming a proton in the @xmath142 state into an empty neutron in the @xmath143 level .",
    "the spin - flip configuration in the daughter is therefore the starting point and it is this configuration whose excitation with respect to the g.s . would yield the sought for gt - centroid .",
    "the m1 method generates , in the @xmath140 mother , the @xmath141 analog of this sf- configuration by the application of the @xmath144 ( isospin - raising ) operator . in general",
    ", there may be more than one aias of the sf - configuration which are orthogonal to each other .",
    "these aias states contain most of the m1 excitation configuration strength and their energy can be calculated from the single - particle shell model , taking into account the particle - hole repulsion energy and the pairing energy wherever relevant .",
    "the @xmath141 analog state is seperated upwards from the aias states by the lane potential .",
    "once the energy of this @xmath141 analog state in the mother ( of the sf - configuration in the daughter ) is known , subtraction of the energy of the analog state corresponding to the g.s . of the daughter ( ` the first analog ' ) would yield the approximate excitation energy of the sf - configuration in the @xmath141 daughter with respect to its g.s .",
    ", which is the required @xmath57 centroid in the daughter .",
    "this assumes an argument similar to the brink hypothesis , as discussed later .",
    "the first analog state in the mother is often known experimentally , and where available , this is an advantage in the m1-method .    as an illustration of this method , we consider the case of gt@xmath119 centroid in @xmath37mn ( for the @xmath37fe(e@xmath11 , @xmath145)@xmath37mn reaction ) .",
    "7a shows the g.s .",
    "configuration of the mother nucleus @xmath37fe .",
    "the spin - flip excitation of @xmath37mn are shown in figs . 7b and alongside it are shown the excited states of @xmath37fe which are obtained by operating @xmath146 on the spin - flip state of @xmath37mn .",
    "thus the gt excitation corresponding to the sf excitation in fig .",
    "7b ( in @xmath37mn ) will be a superposition of two shown basis configurations .",
    "now , the aias corresponding to these two configurations can be constructed and its position in energy is determined as the weighted sum of the single particle excitation energies and the lane potential ( 3.70 mev for this case ) .",
    "the weighting factors obtained from m1 method for the @xmath37fe excited state configurations are @xmath147 and @xmath148 respectively ( see fig . 7 ) and the excitation energies for each configuration in fig .",
    "7b are noted below them .",
    "the position of the gt excitation corresponding to the s - f configuration of @xmath37mn will then be given by the difference in the energy of the obtained ias state and the ias state in @xmath37fe corresponding to the g.s .",
    "of @xmath37mn ( the so called first analog state",
    " located at an excitation energy of 8.7 mev ",
    "see below ) .",
    "a few examples of the m1 method in @xmath140 to @xmath141 transitions are given in table  [ tab : m1comp ] .",
    "for all the nuclei quoted in table  [ tab : m1comp ] , the required @xmath100 in the mother is known from experiment . for the mother nuclei quoted in table  [ tab : ffncomp ] the @xmath100 of the daughter ground states",
    "were obtained from @xcite ( @xmath39fe ) and @xcite ( @xmath84co ) and are 11.51 and 9.55 mev respectively .",
    "for @xmath37fe we note that ref .",
    "@xcite gives only the isobaric analog states corresponding to a few excited levels of @xmath37mn .",
    "the difference of the ias energies and the corresponding levels in @xmath37mn are in the range of 8.59 to 8.79 mev . using the assumption ( similar to the brink hypothesis in electromagnetic transitions ",
    "see @xcite ) that the energies in the resonance states scale in the same way as those of the discrete states in the daughter , we adopt the mean value of 8.7 mev as the @xmath100 in @xmath37fe corresponding to the g.s . of @xmath37mn .",
    "the numbers quoted in the last column of table  [ tab : m1comp ] are for ias states giving gt energy closest to the experimentally observed gt - centroid .    for the nuclei under consideration , the experimental inputs coupled with the given theoretical prescriptions ( m1 and ffn method ) give numbers which can be compared with the empirical relations obtained here .",
    "tables  [ tab : ffncomp ] and  [ tab : m1comp ] show that the empirically fitted values of @xmath118 and @xmath149 as reported in section  [ sec : gtcentroid ] are somewhat closer to the experimental centroids than the numbers obtained from the m1 and ffn methods . the results of sections  [ sec : gtstrength ] and  [ sec : gtcentroid ] can therefore be used to calculate the weak transition properties of f - p shell nuclei of interest to astrophysics .",
    "attempts have been made in the past to obtain a simple mass formula for the gt@xmath11 energy systematics using the single particle level structure and two particle bohr mottelson type interaction hamiltonians .",
    "the gtgr and the ias states can be considered to be collective excitations excited by the spin - dependent and charge - exchange @xmath150 and @xmath151 operators .",
    "more specifically , in the @xmath58 direction , the energy difference @xmath152 can be written as ( see e.g. suzuki @xcite , 1982 ) : @xmath153 the following form of the two particle interaction hamiltonian ( bohr and mottelson , 1981 ) for example has been used here by various authors ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath154 where @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 are the coupling constants ( divided by the mass number ) for the spin - spin , isospin - isospin and the spin - isospin interaction terms and @xmath158 is the single particle spin - orbit coupling constant . using the simplification",
    "brought about by considering the case of very neutron rich nuclei where the tamm - dancoff approximation would be valid and further considering only nulclei for which the protons occupy the major shells and the neutrons fill the @xmath159 subshell , e.g. in the cases of @xmath126zr and @xmath124ca , suzuki @xcite has used the experimentally known values of @xmath101 to determine the difference in the coupling constants ( @xmath160 ) ( see table 6 ) .    another approach ( due to gaarde @xcite ) to the gtgr energy systematics is from the field description of the coherent particle - hole excitations which lead to the gt resonance .",
    "in the field description , the coherent state is generated by an oscillation of average field in the spin - isospin state which is propotional to @xmath161 .",
    "the self - consistency condition on this oscillating potential leads to a dispersion relation for the energy of the gt collective state .",
    "further , if it is assumed that the strength is clustered mainly around two regions , one corresponding to the no - spin - flip transitions with energy @xmath162 and the other to the spin - flip transitions with energy @xmath163 then , the energy dispersion relation equivalent to an rpa equation for a seperable force can be written as : @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the fraction of the total strength lying in the spin - flip region , and @xmath166 is the spin - orbit splitting energy .",
    "the quantity @xmath165 is evaluated for each of the nuclei ( for which ( p , n ) data exists ) from the single particle transition configurations constructed using the ffn method and is tabulated in table  [ tab : sf - fraction ] .",
    "a similar expression may be developed for the ias transition which has the form : @xmath167 using the experimentally known values of @xmath100 and eq .",
    "( 7 ) , we obtain the value of @xmath156 as @xmath168 . keeping this value of @xmath156 fixed , the experimental values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 obtained from table  [ tab : ffncomp ] and fig .",
    "3 are fitted by a two parameter least square fit to the quantity @xmath169 , where the first term is evaluated from the quadratic roots of eq .",
    "this gives the value of @xmath170 as @xmath171 .",
    "as is shown in table  [ tab : cconst ] , these values differ from those obtained for @xmath172pb , or even for @xmath126zr region , indicating that in order to explain both the ias and gt energetics , the simple bohr - mottelson hamiltonian requires coupling coefficients which are substantially different for different shells . at the same time it is not surprising that the relation ( 4 ) developed for f - p shell nuclei which can be shown to depend on the coupling constants ( as in the approach of suzuki @xcite , @xcite ) , would differ substantially from similar relations @xcite developed for a different region of the isotope table .",
    "since the spectral distribution theory is essentially a statistical theory requiring the existence of a large number of basis states , this approach is expected to be valid only for nuclei which are far removed from the closed shell and sub - shell configurations . using the framework of the spectral distribution theory , we have used the experimental data on charge exchange reactions on fp - shell nuclei to obtain the energy centroid of the collective gamow - teller resonances for arbitrary nuclei in this shell .",
    "these quantities , together with the prediction of total gt strength ( such as given in @xcite ) are useful in the prediction of reaction rates mediated by weak - interactions in the cores of massive pre - supernova stars .",
    "we have in eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) a dependence of the gt energy centroids in the f - p shell on the spin orbit interaction , the lane potential and the pairing energy .",
    "further , with a view to comparing the implications of the experimental results for fp - shell nuclei with earlier work on heavier nuclei ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) we have used the experimental values of the gt@xmath11 centroids and the ias energies to extract the relevant coupling coefficients in the bohr - mottelson hamiltonian , for the f - p shell .",
    "the fact that they differ from those of the earlier studies for heavier nuclei such as in the region of @xmath172pb indicates that apart from the @xmath173 dependence , there may be an intrinsic shell dependence of these coupling constants when a simple model like the one due to bohr - mottelson has to be used",
    ".    the results of these calculations are being used to predict the neutrino energy spectrum during the collapse phase upto the point of @xmath174-trapping . in the event of a sufficiently nearby supernova explosion ,",
    "these can be compared with the neutrino spectroscopy results obtainable by future neutrino detectors ( e.g. sno , icarus )  thereby revealing clues to the important thermodynamic and nuclear conditions of the presupernova core .",
    "a preliminary discussion of this was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .        after",
    "this work was accepted for publication , a paper on experimental g - t strength distributions in @xmath76ni , @xmath176ni and @xmath177ni by williams et al ( phys .",
    "c @xmath178 , 1144 ( 1995 ) ) came to our notice . using their experimental data , we find that the strength weighted energy centroids for these nuclei are at 2.59 , 2.56 and 2.8 mev respectively .",
    "this is to be compared with our predictions ( from eq .",
    "( 5 ) ) of 2.59 , 2.21 and 1.865 mev . while the predictions of eq .",
    "( 5 ) ( based on the ( n , p ) data of the earlier seven nuclei ) are reasonably good for @xmath76ni and @xmath176ni , it does not work well in the case of @xmath177ni , possibly because in the latter nucleus much of the strength is concentrated in the ground state to ground state transition .",
