    "the orders of the dissipation and perturbation have special powers of @xmath5 .",
    "it does not lead to a loss of a generality because these terms contain additional parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 . on the other hand it allows us to include these terms in the primary resonance equation @xcite .",
    "the autoresonance means the essential growth of nonlinear oscillations due to a small oscillating force @xcite .",
