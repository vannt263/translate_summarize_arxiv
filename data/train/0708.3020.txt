    "for main sequence binary stars , the orbital period ( @xmath6 ) distribution tells us primarily about the binary formation processes and the angular momentum ( @xmath7 ) distribution among the pre - stellar fragments .",
    "these processes appear to produce a featureless , ( almost ) scale - free distribution @xmath8 with a very mild maximum at @xmath9 years ( * ? ? ?",
    "* = dm91 ) .",
    "the dominance of the underlying logarithmic distribution was particularly stressed by @xcite ; in fact , sometimes in theoretical simulations , a flat distribution @xmath10 is assumed .",
    "contact binaries of the w  uma type do not obey the flat logarithmic period distribution : not only a very sharp edge d has the shortest period .",
    "v34 in the @xcite survey of the globular cluster 47  tuc has an even shorter period of @xmath11 d ; contact binaries in globular clusters are expected to be smaller and tighter @xcite . ] to the distribution appears at about 0.215  0.22 d , but a strong maximum in the period distribution is present very close to the cut - off at very short periods .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig1 ] showing data for the best observed 352 short - period ( @xmath12 day ) binary systems from the catalogue of @xcite .",
    "the sharp edge is particularly well defined in the @xmath13 distribution ( left panel ) , but  in view of what has been said above  a better way to analyze the numbers may be to use @xmath14 units ( right panel ) .",
    "although the short period cut - off is then less sharp , a well defined maximum is still there .",
    "however , the catalogue data may be affected by several selection effects .",
    "first of all , the very steep period  luminosity relation ( see below ) results in a strong dependence of the search volume on the period . in addition ,",
    "random discovery conditions and preferential attention of variable - star observers produce additional , totally uncharacterized selection effects .",
    "the period range of 6 to 12 hours , exactly the region of interest here , is particularly prone to various subjective preferences .",
    "an attempt was made by @xcite to explain the period cut - off as a `` full convection limit '' for low mass stars .",
    "although this gave some insight into the physics of the least massive contact binaries , it failed to explain the existence of the cut - off . because the w  uma - type contact binaries are very magnetically active , an explanation for the cut - off may be related to their activity , but it is not clear how . following the pioneering work of @xcite and several observational evidences of `` saturated '' magnetic ( coronal , chromospheric ) activity at very short rotation periods , @xcite attempted to explain the period cut - off by the magnetic - wind driven angular momentum loss ( aml ) , operating in such a saturated regime .",
    "he found that at the shortest periods , the aml rate depends primarily on the binary moment of inertia ( which can vary in contact binaries due to possibility of the mass transfer between components ) .",
    "this results in a progressive decay of the aml rate with the shortening of the period so that the period evolution takes progressively longer time .",
    "the period cut - off would be then due to the finite age of the binary population of several gyr .",
    "note that the tendency of @xmath15 would produce a logarithmically flat distribution of periods , @xmath16 , while a decreasing @xmath17 would lead to a pile - up at short periods .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the shape of the period distribution close to the period cut - off . to avoid the most obvious selection effects , the uniform and well characterized asas sample @xcite is used , the same as in ( * ?",
    "* paper  i ) where it was used to estimate the local fractional number density of w  uma systems at @xmath0 of the fgk dwarfs .",
    "the same approach was utilized there so that the reader is referred to previous paper for details .",
    "the material for this study is the asas sample discussed in paper  i , consisting of 5381 binaries and apparently uniform in terms of detection selection effects within the range @xmath18 .",
    "although many small amplitude binaries are included in the sample , down to amplitudes of @xmath19 mag , the amplitude detection threshold for completeness is relatively high for this sample at about 0.4 mag , necessitating a correction for missed low - amplitude binaries of approximately @xmath20 times ( paper  i ) .",
    "the asas photometric data are in only one @xmath21 band .",
    "for that reason the @xmath22 calibration of @xcite could not be used for distance estimates .",
    "this forced utilization of a sub - sample of 3374 shortest - period binaries where a simplified period ",
    "absolute magnitude calibration appears to be valid ( paper  i ) . this way the dominant selection effect of the search volume being directly dependent on the binary period could be taken into account .",
    "the period dependence in the calibration is very steep , @xmath23 ; it certainly does not apply for @xmath24 ( or @xmath25 d ) where the luminosity is seen to depend on both , the period and the colour index .",
    "the selection of the asas sample used in paper  i was not altered in any way except for a particular attention to existence of contact binaries at @xmath26 d. the on - line version of the asas database was carefully scrutinized ( appendix  [ append ] ) and  indeed  from 7 systems previously included in paper  i , only one has remained as a genuine contact binary ( 083128 + 1953.1 , @xmath27 d ) ; this is currently the shortest period record holder among galactic field w  uma binaries .",
    ".[tab1 ] the volume - corrected period distribution @xmath28 derived from the asas sample and expressed as number of contact systems per interval @xmath29 in units of @xmath30 stars  pc@xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is the number of binaries per interval ; it can be used to derive the poisson uncertainty of @xmath28 .",
    "the first column gives the low edge of each bin . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the seven systems of the asas sample with @xmath3 d ( table  [ taba ] ) were checked if they are genuinely contact binaries .",
    "the on - line version of the asas-3 catalogue was consulted for updates and the tycho-2 catalogue @xcite was used as a source of @xmath33 colour index data .",
    "it appears that the system 042606 + 0126.5 has been re - classified in the asas catalogue to a @xmath34 sct pulsating star with the period 2 times shorter than estimated before . also , the asas tables give @xmath35 for 174930 - 3355.4 while its rather poor light curve clearly shows @xmath36 ; thus , the star is fainter than the adopted completeness limit of @xmath37 .",
    "two more stars are fainter than this limit and also have poor light curves , 071829 - 0336.7 and 113031 - 0101.9 .",
    "short period contact binaries must be red because they consist of mid - k dwarfs .",
    "thus , a colour index which is not sufficiently red ( @xmath38 ) can be used to reject @xmath34 sct and @xmath39 cep pulsating stars .",
    "this criterion was used to eliminate 162155 - 2128.7 and 201354 - 4633.4 ."
