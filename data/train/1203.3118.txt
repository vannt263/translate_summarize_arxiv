    "the latest daya bay @xcite and reno @xcite reactor antineutrino oscillation experiments constitute another milestone , because their results convince us that the smallest neutrino mixing angle @xmath0 is not really small : its best - fit value is about @xmath6 @xcite . in comparison , the other two mixing angles @xmath7 and @xmath8 are about @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively @xcite .",

    "the three cp - violating phases remain unknown , but one of them ( i.e. , the dirac phase @xmath20 ) may hopefully be measured in the future long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments since @xmath0 is already known not to be very small .",
    "the strength of leptonic cp violation in neutrino oscillations is governed by the rephasing - invariant jarlskog parameter @xmath21 @xcite , and that is why an appreciable value of @xmath0 is a good news for us to explore leptonic cp violation in the near future .",
    "the fact that @xmath0 is not as small as previously expected motivates us to reconsider how it can be generated at the tree level or by quantum corrections @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall follow a model - independent way to look at the impacts of a relatively large @xmath0 on the running behaviors of the other two mixing angles and cp - violating phases for both dirac and majorana neutrinos by using the one - loop renormalization - group equations ( rges ) in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",

    "in other words , cp violation is an intrinsic property of the lepton flavor structure : if it is present ( or absent ) at a given energy scale , it must be present ( or absent ) at any other energy scales .",

    "in particular , the cp - violating phases play a crucial role in the rges .",
    "let us elaborate on this point in the following .",

    "can be adjusted by choosing different values of the cp - violating phases @xmath20 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . to illustrate this observation ,",
    "let us carry out an explicit numerical analysis .",

    "the fact that the rge of @xmath7 is dominated by the term @xmath105 implies that the magnitude of the radiative correction to @xmath7 depends strongly on the phase difference @xmath106 .",

    "the radiative corrections to the three mixing angles in both normal ( @xmath148 ) and inverted ( @xmath149 ) neutrino mass hierarchies are less significant than those in the case of a nearly degenerate neutrino mass spectrum .",

    "the corresponding outputs at @xmath68 in both the mssm10 case and the mssm50 case are summarized in table iii . in the case of the normal hierarchy with @xmath150 ,",
    "the resulting values of the three mixing angles at @xmath68 are all close to their values at @xmath31 , implying that the rge running effects are insignificant . as for the inverted hierarchy with @xmath153 ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath8 and @xmath0 is also insignificant , but that of @xmath7 is appreciable in the mssm10 case and quite significant in the mssm50 case .",
    "now let us make a brief summary .",
    "in order to obtain a phenomenologically - favored neutrino mixing pattern at the electroweak scale @xmath25 , we have examined the corresponding mixing pattern at a superhigh - energy scale @xmath68 which might result from a certain flavor symmetry . in the mssm10 case",
    "the values of @xmath8 and @xmath0 predicted at @xmath68 are always close to their running values at @xmath25 , while the value of @xmath7 at @xmath68 can be somewhat smaller or larger than its running value at @xmath25 . in the mssm50 case the allowed ranges of the three mixing angles at @xmath68 can be quite wide , as we have discussed above .",
    "however , a crucial point is that a given flavor symmetry model should be able to predict the appropriate cp - violating phases at @xmath68 in order to obtain the appropriate mixing angles at @xmath25 after the rge evolution .",
    "we find that it is in general impossible to generate @xmath1 at @xmath25 from @xmath131 at @xmath68 through the radiative corrections , unless some new degrees of freedom or nontrivial running effects ( such as the seesaw threshold effects @xcite ) are taken into account .",
    "this observation is consistent with the discussions in ref .",
    "in this section we consider the correlative neutrino mixing pattern with @xmath154 , @xmath4 and @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "the three mixing angles in this constant scenario satisfy two interesting sum rules , @xmath156 the latter sum rule is geometrically illustrated in fig .",
    "the corresponding lepton flavor mixing matrix is @xcite @xmath157 which might be derived from a certain underlying flavor symmetry in a neutrino mass model at a superhigh - energy scale .",
    "compared with the best - fit values of the three mixing angles at @xmath25 given in ref .",
    "@xcite , the three mixing angles in this correlative mixing pattern at @xmath68 have to receive comparably small radiative corrections during their rge evolution . as we have mentioned in the last section , this requirement can easily be achieved in the mssm10 case provided the condition @xmath158 is satisfied for a nearly degenerate neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "such a condition is unnecessary if the neutrino mass spectrum has a strong hierarchy .    to illustrate , we study the rge evolution of @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( 16 ) and present our results in table iv .",
    "we input @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 at @xmath162 for example , and then obtain the phenomenologically - favored results @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 at @xmath139 after the radiative corrections .",
    "if the three cp - violating phases can be specified in a given flavor symmetry model at @xmath68 , however , the running behaviors of the three mixing angles will be more restrictive .    given the rges in the framework of the standard model @xcite , the evolution of @xmath7 , @xmath0 and @xmath8 in the correlative mixing pattern is insignificant but their running directions may be opposite to those in the mssm case ( depending on the cp - violating phases ) . if the experimental error bars of the three mixing angles turn to be sufficiently small in the future , it might be possible to see which framework is more suitable for the radiative corrections to the correlative neutrino mixing pattern .",
    "in view of @xmath1 as observed in the recent daya bay and reno experiments , we have reexamined the radiative corrections to the lepton flavor mixing matrix for both dirac and majorana neutrinos by considering both nearly degenerate and strongly hierarchical neutrino mass spectra in the framework of the mssm .",
    "two typical values of @xmath47 ( i.e. , 10 and 50 ) have been taken in our numerical calculations .",
    "we conclude that it is difficult to generate @xmath1 at @xmath139 from @xmath131 at @xmath162 through the radiative corrections , unless a sufficiently large value of @xmath47 is assumed or the seesaw threshold effects or some new degrees of freedom are taken into account .",
    "therefore , we argue that it is more natural for a flavor symmetry model to predict a relatively large @xmath0 at @xmath162 . to illustrate this point , we have briefly discussed the correlative mixing pattern with @xmath154 , @xmath4 and @xmath155 as an example of this kind .",
    "let us remark that fixing @xmath1 and taking the correlative neutrino mixing pattern in our rge analysis just serve for illustration .",
    "it is certainly possible to generate the values of @xmath0 within the present experimental limits ( but not necessarily close to @xmath6 ) from @xmath131 at a superhigh - energy scale in the mssm with an appropriate value of @xmath47 or with the help of some new degrees of freedom .",
    "however , we stress that @xmath0 might initially be nonzero and its appreciable value might have a significant impact on the running behaviors of the other two mixing angles and cp - violating phases .",
    "our study clearly shows that a measurement of the dirac cp - violating phase @xmath20 in the forthcoming long - baseline oscillation experiments and any experimental information about the majorana cp - violating phases @xmath18 and @xmath19 are extremely important , so as to distinguish one flavor symmetry model from another through their different sensitivities to the radiative corrections .",
    "this observation makes sense in particular after the experimental errors associated with the neutrino mixing parameters are comparable with or smaller than the magnitudes of their respective rge running effects .",
