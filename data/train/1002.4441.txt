    "charmonium production is considered , since the original proposal more than 20 years ago about its suppression in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite , an important probe to determine the degree of deconfinement reached in the fireball produced in ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions . in the original scenario of j/@xmath0 suppression via debye screening @xcite it is assumed that the charmonia are rapidly formed in initial hard collisions but are subsequently destroyed in the qgp ( see recent summaries in @xcite ) .    in recent publications",
    "@xcite we have demonstrated that the data on j/@xmath0 and @xmath1 production in nucleus - nucleus collisions at the sps ( @xmath2 gev ) and rhic ( @xmath3=200 gev ) energies can be well described within the statistical hadronization model proposed in @xcite and have provided predictions for the lhc energy ( @xmath3=5.5 tev ) and for energies close to threshold ( @xmath4 gev ) .",
    "because the mass of heavy quarks exceeds the transition temperature of the qcd phase transition by a factor of almost 8 , heavy flavor hadron production can not be described in a purely thermal approach .",
    "it was , however , realized in @xcite that charmonium and charmed hadron production can be well described by assuming that all charm quarks are produced in initial , hard collisions while charmed hadron and charmonium production takes place exclusively at the phase boundary with statistical weights calculated in a thermal approach .",
    "for a recent review of this statistical hadronization approach see @xcite .",
    "an important element is thermal equilibration , at least near the critical temperature , @xmath5 , which we believe can be achieved efficiently for charm only in the qgp .",
    "an important question is whether the statistical behavior is a unique feature of high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions or whether it is also encountered in elementary collisions , where finite size effects will obscure a possible phase transition . in early analyses ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it is indeed argued that hadron production in e@xmath6e@xmath7 and pp is thermal in nature . furthermore , such analyses of hadron multiplicities ( for recent results see @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) yield also temperature values in the range of 160 - 170 mev .    to establish the uniqueness of the j/@xmath0 probe for the diagnosis of a qgp in nucleus - nucleus collisions",
    "it is important to understand whether similar thermal features as observed in nucleus - nucleus collisions are also at work in heavy - flavor hadron production in elementary collisions .",
    "we have recently demonstrated @xcite that there are crucial differences in elementary collisions compared to nucleus - nucleus .",
    "for the study of hadron production in e@xmath6e@xmath7 collisions we employ the canonical statistical model described in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . for the present study",
    ", we perform calculations for two cases : i ) a 2-jet initial state which carries the quantum numbers of the 5 flavors , with the relative abundance of the five flavors in one jet and corresponding antiflavor in the other jet taken form the measurements at the @xmath8 resonance quoted in @xcite .",
    "these relative abundances ( 17.6% for @xmath9 and @xmath10 and 21.6% for @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) are thus external input values , unrelated with the thermal model .",
    "ii ) a purely thermal ansatz , i.e. a 2-jet initial state characterized by vanishing quantum numbers in each jet .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show a comparison of data @xcite and model prediction for charmed and bottom hadron yields in e@xmath6e@xmath7 annihilations at @xmath14=91 gev . for the model we have used the parameter",
    "set : @xmath15=170 mev , @xmath16=16 @xmath17 and @xmath18=0.66 , which represents the best fit of multiplicities of hadrons with lighter quarks @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the centrality dependence of @xmath19 at midrapidity is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ aa_fig2 ] .",
    "our calculations approach the value in pp collisions around @xmath20=50 , which corresponds to an assumed minimal volume for the creation of qgp of 400 @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the model reproduces very well the decreasing trend versus centrality seen in the rhic data @xcite .",
    "note that , in our model , the centrality dependence of the nuclear modification factor arises entirely as a consequence of the still rather moderate rapidity density of initially produced charm quark pairs at rhic ( @xmath21=1.6 for central collisions , using the fonll charm production cross section @xcite ) leading to a marked centrality dependence of the canonical suppression factor for open charm hadrons . at the much higher lhc energy the charm production cross section ( including shadowing in pbpb collisions @xcite )",
    "is expected to be about an order of magnitude larger . as a result ,",
    "the opposite trend as a function of centrality is predicted , with @xmath19 exceeding unity for central collisions .",
    "a significantly larger enhancement of about a factor of 2 is obtained if the charm production cross section is two times larger than presently assumed , as seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ aa_fig2 ] , where we show the @xmath22 production relative to the number of initially produced @xmath10 pairs .",
    "we have shown that the statistical hadronization model describes well the measured decrease with centrality and the rapidity dependence of @xmath19 at rhic energy .",
    "importantly , well described in central heavy - ion collisions at sps energy , where we have the only measurement to date , is the ratio @xmath23 .",
    "in contrast , in elementary , e@xmath6e@xmath7 and in pp and p(@xmath24)-nucleus , collisions the charmonium measurements can not be explained within the statistical model .",
    "this underlines the relevance of the statistical features in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "extrapolation to lhc energy leads , contrary to the observations at rhic , to @xmath19 increasing with collision centrality .",
    "if observed , such a behavior will provide a dramatic proof of charmonium as the ultimate observable to delineate the phase boundary of qcd matter . k.r .",
