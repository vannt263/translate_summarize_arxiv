    "3d fluorescence microscopy is a critical tool in biological microscopy , since most samples are thick and can be functionally labeled . for high - resolution 3d imaging ,",
    "the main methods used are confocal microscopy  @xcite , two - photon  @xcite and light sheet imaging  @xcite .",
    "because these methods all involve scanning , they are are inherently limited in terms of speed or volume .",
    "light field microscopy  @xcite , on the other hand , achieves single - shot 3d capture at a cost of severe resolution loss .",
    "single - shot coded aperture imaging  @xcite can reconstruct 3d fluorescent scenes with good resolution , if the sample is extremely sparse .",
    "here , we seek a multi - shot method that uses efficient and flexible data capture to reconstruct large dense volumes with high resolution .",
    "our work fits into the framework of phase - space optics , which is the general term for any space - angle description of light  @xcite .",
    "light fields , for example , are phase - space functions for ray optics with incoherent light .",
    "the light field describes each ray s position and angle at a particular plane .",
    "light field measurements have been used for digital refocusing  @xcite , aberration removal  @xcite and 3d reconstruction . in microscopy ,",
    "wave - optical effects become prominent and so ray optics no longer suffices . hence",
    ", we switch to using wigner functions , which are the wave - optical analog to light fields  @xcite .",
    "the wigner function describes spatial and spatial frequency ( propagation angle ) information for a wave - field of arbitrary coherence ; it converges to the light field in the limit of incoherent ray optics  @xcite .",
    "wigner functions contain the same information as as the mutual intensity function or a coherent mode decomposition ; each of which can be derived as a unitary mathematical transform of the wigner function  @xcite . in the case of fluorescence microscopy , where the object is a set of incoherent emitters",
    ", the wigner function represents the incoherent 3d optical transfer function ( otf )  @xcite . as a type of spatial coherence imaging  @xcite",
    ", wigner measurement can be used for 3d reconstructions in scattering media  @xcite .",
    "phase - space imaging is 4d , with two spatial and two spatial - frequency coordinates .",
    "this high dimensionality poses measurement challenges  @xcite . in single - shot schemes ,",
    "the 2d sensor pixels must be distributed across 4d , severely restricting resolution .",
    "our experimental setup consists of a spatial light modulator ( slm ) in fourier space to implement aperture patterns , while collecting multiple 2d intensity images in real space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme - tot ] ) . in previous work",
    "@xcite , the slm scanned a small aperture through fourier space , capturing 2d intensity images for each spatial frequency .",
    "the acquired 4d phase space thus has very large pixel count - the product of the pixel counts of the slm and the sensor ( typically @xmath1 ) .",
    "these large datasets present challenges for data storage , and acquisition is slow ( @xmath210 minutes ) , limiting applications .",
    "we seek here a flexible trade - off between time and resolution , with ability to exploit sparsity for further data reduction , by using a multiplexed measurement approach .    in this work ,",
    "the slm implements a series of quasi - random coded aperture patterns ( the optimal patterns are object - dependent ) . compared to the scanning aperture method  @xcite , the new scheme has three major benefits .",
    "first , it achieves better resolution by capturing high - frequency interference effects ( high - order correlations ) .",
    "this enables diffraction - limited resolution that is set by the microscope s na , rather than by the scanned aperture .",
    "second , we achieve higher light throughput by opening up more of the pupil ; this can be traded for shorter exposure time and faster acquisition .",
    "finally , the multiplexed nature of the measurements enables application of compressed - sensing ideas that exploit sparsity to capture fewer images for a given 4d resolution .",
    "phase - space multiplexing for 3d fluorescence microscopy .",
    "the microscope ( a @xmath3 system ) uses a spatial light modulator ( slm ) in fourier space to implement multiple coded apertures , while capturing 2d intensity images in real space for each .",
    "our wave - optical forward model ( @xmath4 ) relates the sample ( @xmath5 ) to the measured images ( @xmath6 ) for each pattern .",
    "the inverse problem recovers the sample , possibly subject to sparsity priors.,scaledwidth=97.0% ]    our method can be alternately described as diffraction - limited 3d fluorescence microscopy with multiple coded apertures , similar to computational photography  @xcite and microscopy  @xcite . in our case , we use a wave - optical model to fully account for diffraction effects , so intensity measurements are nonlinear with complex - field .",
    "however , the mutual incoherence of different fluorophores allows a simplification on the forward model .",
    "we model each fluorophore as a single coherent mode - it is coherent with itself but incoherent with all other fluorophores .",
    "our reconstruction algorithm is a large - scale inverse problem akin to multi - image 3d deconvolution , formulated as a convex @xmath7 regularized least - square error problem and solved by a fast iterative shrinkage - thresholding algorithm ( fista )  @xcite .",
    "in this section we use the wigner function  ( wf ) and its close relative mutual intensity  ( mi ) to describe the multiplexing process , then specify our scheme for 3d fluorescent microscopy .",
    "the wf is a function of position and spatial frequency , where spatial frequency can be thought of as the direction of ray propagation in geometrical optics .",
    "here we assume the light is quasi - monochromatic , temporally stationary and ergodic  @xcite .",
    "the wigner function is : @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes transverse spatial coordinates , @xmath10 denotes spatial frequency coordinates and @xmath11 denotes ensemble average . the quantity contained by angle brackets",
    "@xmath12 is , apart from a coordinate transform , the mutual intensity .",
    "@xmath13 is a coherent mode of the electric field ( e.g. a fluorophore ) and @xmath14 is its fourier transform .",
    "the ensemble average enables representation of both coherent and partially spatially coherent light , with multiple wavelengths being accounted for by integrating the wfs for each . here",
    ", we assume that the sample is a 3d volume of incoherent emitters with no occlusions .",
    "thus , the phase - space description of light from the sample is a linear sum of that from each fluorophore .",
    "the aperture patterns are applied in the pupil plane ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : scheme - tot ] ) while intensity images are captured in real space . based on the raw data and forward model ,",
    "the reconstruction problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization procedure .",
    "when the sample does not fill the entire 3d volume , we use a sparsity prior to reduce the number of images necessary for full phase - space capture . in previous work",
    "@xcite , we accounted for scattering ( _ e.g. _ in biological tissue ) by incorporating a scattering model into the forward problem . for simplicity , we assume here no scattering , though incorporating the model is straightforward .",
    "our forward model relates the captured images to the 3d object , for each multiplexed pattern .",
    "each image contains information from multiple frequencies and their interference terms ( which are key to resolution enhancement ) .",
    "the mi framework facilitates our mathematical analysis .",
    "the operation of applying the 3d optical transfer function  ( otf ) to an incoherent source is equivalent to projecting a mask in mi space ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : multiplex - mc ] ) .",
    "mi analysis can further reveal interference effects that may be obscured by looking only at this projected quantity , aiding in mask design . for simplicity , we first describe the forward model of a single coherent mode ( e.g. a single point source ) and then generalize to multiple modes .",
    "illustration of how a 1d complex - field is patterned in mutual intensity ( mi ) space by a particular coded aperture pattern .",
