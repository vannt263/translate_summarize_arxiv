    "@xmath0-dependent properties are remarkably illustrated by the transition from indirect band gap semiconductor , in the bulk form , to direct band gap at monolayer thickness that occurs in @xmath8 mo- and w - based mx@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "direct band gaps , together with the possibility of achieving valley polarization for resonantly pumped band - edge excitons in monolayer mx@xmath1  @xcite , open original perspectives for two - dimensional optoelectronics  @xcite and valleytronics  @xcite .    an interesting direction in this field , consists in exploring mx@xmath1 with smaller optical band gaps ( _ i.e. _ , related to the formation of tightly bound excitons  @xcite ) than the extensively studied monolayers of mos@xmath1 , mose@xmath1 , ws@xmath1 , wse@xmath1 , whose optical band gaps lie in the range @xmath9  ev  @xcite .",
    "such endeavors are motivated by the possibility of achieving gate - controlled ambipolar transport more efficiently  @xcite and to extend optoelectronic applications of mx@xmath1 , in particular in van der waals heterostructures  @xcite , into the near - infrared range . among the possible candidates , @xmath0-layer molybdenum ditelluride ( mote@xmath1 )  @xcite , as well as rhenium diselenide ( rese@xmath1 ) have emerged very recently . while @xmath0-layer rese@xmath1 crystals exhibit a distorted @xmath10-phase  @xcite and are indirect band gap semiconductors , irrespective of @xmath0  @xcite , stable @xmath0-layer @xmath8-mote@xmath1 crystals",

    "in addition , the evolution of the pl spectrum and integrated pl intensity of monolayer mote@xmath1 with increasing exciton density remains unexplored so far .    in this article",

    "our data show that the pl quantum yield of monolayer mote@xmath1 is approximately three times ( forty times ) larger than that of bilayer ( bulk ) mote@xmath1 , confirming the transition from a bulk indirect band gap ( giving rise to an emission line at @xmath11 ) to a direct optical band gap at @xmath12  @xcite .",

    "it is well known that interference effects strongly affect the exciton formation rate , as well as the raman  @xcite and pl  @xcite response of layered materials deposited on layered substrates such as si / sio@xmath1 . in order to take these phenomena into account , _ interference - free _ pl",

    "@xcite , the pl background from the si substrate is negligible in our experiments ( see supplemental material  @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2](b ) displays the _ interference - free _ pl spectra .",
    "the pl lineshapes are marginally affected as compared to the raw spectra , whereas the integrated _ interference - free _ pl intensity is significantly modified .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , we immediately notice that ( i ) the integrated pl intensity decreases monotonically and is three ( resp .",
    "forty ) times smaller in bilayer ( resp . bulk ) mote@xmath1 than in the monolayer limit ( see fig.[fig2](c ) ) , ( ii ) the pl peak energy redshifts from 1.10  ev at monolayer thickness down to 0.94  ev in the bulk limit and ( iii ) the pl lineshapes are slightly asymmetric for @xmath30 and clearly bimodal for @xmath4 .",
    "the first two observations are consistent with a transition from an indirect optical band gap in the bulk limit to a direct optical band gap for @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the increase in pl quantum yield as @xmath0 decreases is moderate , as compared to recent observations in mos@xmath1 , mose@xmath1 , ws@xmath1 , and wse@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is due to the smaller energy difference between the bulk emission from the indirect band gap and the direct optical band gap .",
    "for instance , the latter is approximately 0.6  ev in mos@xmath1  @xcite and 0.5  ev in mose@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the exact value of @xmath0 at which the crossover occurs is still debated .",

    "@xcite have suggested a crossover when reaching the monolayer limit , while lezama _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite concluded that the crossover occurs between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "however , there is no apparent contradiction between these claims since the two experiments were done at room and low ( @xmath31 ) temperature , respectively , and that it is well know that temperature can have an effect on the crossover  @xcite . here",
    ", we could clearly identify two subfeatures within each pl spectrum , as illustrated in fig .",
    "we may now wonder whether these two contributions may be associated with the direct and indirect optical band gaps . to answer this question",
    ", we have systematically fit the pl spectra with a double voigt profile ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) and extracted the high- ( pl@xmath32 ) and low - energy ( pl@xmath33 ) contributions .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] displays the peak positions pl@xmath34 and pl@xmath35 .     to @xmath15 layer mote@xmath1 and of bulk @xmath36 .",
    "the spectra are fit to voigt profiles .",
    "the high ( low ) photoluminescence peak energy is denoted @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) . ]",
    "( green open circles ) and pl@xmath34 ( red circles ) as a function of the number of layers @xmath0 .",
    "the data are extracted from the fits , as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and correspond to the same samples as in  [ fig2](c ) .",
    "our experimental measurements are compared to the reflectance ( open black triangles ) measurements from ref .",
    "( b ) energy difference between the two photoluminescence peaks as a function of the number of layers @xmath0 . ]",
    "first , the pl spectrum of monolayer mote@xmath1 exhibits a quasi - symmetric lineshape dominated by a relatively narrow pl@xmath32 feature with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of approximately 50  mev . the peak position pl@xmath34 matches the energy of the a exciton measured by room temperature differential reflectance spectroscopy by ruppert _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( see fig .  [ fig4](a ) ) and pl@xmath34 is therefore identified as the direct optical band gap energy .",
    "the pl@xmath33 shoulder is much broader ( fwhm of approximately 100  mev ) and has lower integrated intensity than that of the pl@xmath32 peak . assuming that monolayer mote@xmath1 is a direct band gap semiconductor , the pl@xmath33 feature can not arise from the indirect optical band gap . since the energy difference between the @xmath39 features is approximately @xmath40 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ) , the pl@xmath33 peak can tentatively be assigned to emission from charged a excitons ( _ i.e. _ trions  @xcite ) or to exciton - phonon sidebands involving coupling of a excitons with @xmath41-point optical phonons ( which energies lie in the range 15 - 35  mev  @xcite ) .",
    "second , the pl spectrum of bilayer mote@xmath1 is slightly redshifted ( by about 30  mev ) with respect to the monolayer case , with a normalized pl quantum yield about three times smaller than that of monolayer mote@xmath1 , suggesting that bilayer mote@xmath1 is not a direct band gap semiconductor .",
    "however , although the bilayer pl spectrum is appreciably broader than that of the monolayer pl spectrum ( fwhm of approximately 65  mev ) , both spectra bear a strong similarity .",
    "indeed , pl@xmath34 also matches the energy of the a exciton for @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the pl@xmath32 peak is more intense than the pl@xmath33 peak , and the energy difference between the peak positions of these two features remains approximately @xmath40 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , as in monolayer mote@xmath1 .",
    "these observations indicate that the room temperature pl in mono- and bilayer mote@xmath1 likely originate from similar mechanisms .",
    "however , the reduced pl quantum yield of bilayer mote@xmath1 suggests that the indirect ( optical ) band gap is slightly smaller than the direct optical bandgap such that phonon - assisted emission across the indirect band gap may contribute to the broadening of the pl spectrum in bilayer mote@xmath1 .",
    "overall , we conclude that direct band gap emission dominates the room temperature pl response of bilayer mote@xmath1 .",
    "third , the pl spectra of @xmath42-layer mote@xmath1 differ markedly from the mono- and bilayer cases .",
    "we observe ( i ) a broad and prominent pl@xmath43 feature ( with a fhwm of approximately 100  mev ) , which , as @xmath0 increases , progressively dominates the narrower pl@xmath32 feature ( with a fwhm in the range 60 - 70  mev ) , and ( ii ) , as @xmath0 increases , pl@xmath35 downshifts significantly , while pl@xmath34 remains almost constant and very close to the energy of the a exciton absorption line  @xcite . in the bulk limit",
    ", the pl@xmath33 peak is centered at 0.94  ev and is followed by a much fainter feature near 1.03  ev   recorded in bulk and few - layer flakes ( @xmath44 ) ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) may arise from the fact that the bulk conduction band minimum occurs at a point in momentum space that lies halfway between the @xmath45 and and the @xmath46 points , while the conduction band minimum is reached at the @xmath46 point in the few - layer limit . ] .",
    "thus , the pl@xmath32 and pl@xmath33 peaks can tentatively be assigned to competing emission pathways , associated with hot luminescence from the a exciton and with phonon - assisted emission from the indirect excitons , respectively .",
    "note that the pl@xmath33 peak is broader than the pl@xmath32 peak , presumably due to the phonons involved in the indirect emission process .",
    "finally , our conclusions are further confirmed by the fact that the bulk values of pl@xmath47 and pl@xmath48 are in fair agreement with previous measurements of the bulk direct and indirect optical band gaps obtained from optical transmission spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "having introduced monolayer mote@xmath1 as a direct bandgap semiconductor with bright near - infrared emission , we now focus on the influence of @xmath5 on its pl quantum yield and pl spectral lineshape under cw laser excitation .",
    "@xmath5 is simply deduced from the _ effective _ absorptance of monolayer mote@xmath1 in the air / mote@xmath1/sio@xmath1/si layered structure , by taking into account the size of our tightly focused laser spot , the absorptance of bare mote@xmath1  @xcite and optical interference effects ( see supplemental material  @xcite ) . for a laser photon energy of @xmath49",
    ", we calculated an absorptance of @xmath50 for monolayer mote@xmath1 in our sample geometry . assuming that one absorbed photon gives rise to one exciton , the exciton formation rates investigated here range from @xmath51 up to @xmath52 .     at different excitation rates per unit area @xmath5 .",
    "the spectra are normalized by @xmath5 and by the integration time and vertically offset for clarity .",
    "( b ) integrated photoluminescence intensity obtained from the raw spectra ( symbols ) as a function of the exciton formation rate @xmath5 in monolayer mote@xmath1 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to a fit based on equation eq .  .",
    "( c ) photoluminescence spectra of monolayer mote@xmath1 for three different exciton formation rates .",
    "the spectra have been normalized to unity .",
    "the error bars are smaller than the symbol size . ]",
    "figure  [ fig5](a ) shows pl spectra recorded on the same monolayer for increasing values of @xmath5 .",
    "the spectra have been normalized by the incoming laser intensity ( _ i.e. _ , by @xmath5 ) and by the integration time .",
    "we clearly observe a non - linear decrease of the _ normalized _ pl intensity that suggests , as shown in figure  [ fig5](b ) that the _ raw _ integrated pl intensity levels off with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "we have checked that this non - linear behavior was not due to irreversible photo - induced damage of the sample and we have observed a very similar sub - linear rise of the pl intensity on another mote@xmath1 monolayer ( see supplemental material  @xcite ) . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) , we notice that the linewidth of the pl spectra remain independent on @xmath5 and that the pl spectra downshift very slightly ( by only 3 mev ) only when @xmath5 reaches @xmath53 ( _ i.e. _ , a laser intensity of @xmath54 )",
    ". we may thus conclude that biexciton emission  @xcite and photothermally - induced modifications of the pl spectra can be neglected for the range of exciton densities explored here .",
    "sub - linear rises of the integrated pl intensity , as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , have recently been reported in other mx@xmath1 monolayers ( such as wse@xmath1  @xcite , ws@xmath1  @xcite , or mos@xmath1",
    "@xcite ) and assigned to exciton - exciton annihilation ( eea ) .",
    "eea has been further evidenced in these materials ( and additionally in mose@xmath1  @xcite and ws@xmath1  @xcite ) by means of transient absorption spectroscopy  @xcite or time - resolved pl measurements  @xcite , through the observation of accelerated exciton decays at high exciton densities . in order to further demonstrate our observation of eea in monolayer mote@xmath1",
    ", we make use of a simple rate equation model  @xcite .",
    "the integrated pl intensity is proportional to the steady state exciton density @xmath55 .",
    "assuming , that the time dependence of the exciton density @xmath56 is essentially governed by the interplay between exciton formation ( at a rate per unit area @xmath57 ) , linear recombination ( at a rate @xmath58 ) and excition - exciton annihilation ( eea ) ( at a rate @xmath59 ) , one obtains    @xmath60    the eea term in this equation scales quadratically with @xmath61 since the annihilation process involves coulomb interaction between two excitons . the steady state exciton density then writes    @xmath62    the experimental data in fig .  [ fig5](b ) is very well fit by eq . from the fit , we extract @xmath63 . assuming a reasonable value of @xmath64 , similar to previous estimates in substrate - supported mx@xmath1 monolayers  @xcite , one obtains a linear exciton recombination rate of @xmath65 , that is an exciton lifetime of @xmath66 . although additional near - infrared time - resolved measurements or transient absorption studies on monolayer mote@xmath1 are needed to separately determine the exact values of @xmath59 and @xmath58 , our simple analysis provides values that are in - line with recent room - temperature studies on other mx@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "finally , let us also note that monolayer mote@xmath1 and related systems exhibit eea rates that give rise to average exciton decay times similar to those reported in carbon nanotubes  @xcite in the non - linear regime .",
    "in addition , eea in mx@xmath1 is much more efficient than related processes ( _ i.e. _ , auger recombination ) in conventional quantum wells  @xcite .",
    "highly efficient eea between tighly bound excitons  @xcite in monolayer mx@xmath1 reflect the strongly enhanced coulomb interactions and reduced dielectric screening in these atomically thin two - dimensional materials .",
    "we have performed a detailed analysis of the room temperature photoluminescence of @xmath0-layer mote@xmath1 .",
    "monolayer mote@xmath1 is a direct band gap semiconductor , with sharp emission at @xmath67 .",
    "the crossover from a dominant direct excitonic emission ( as observed in monolayers ) to a dominant phonon - assisted indirect emission ( in the bulk limit ) occurs more smoothly than in other @xmath8 transition metal dichalcogenides , such as mos@xmath1 , mose@xmath1 , ws@xmath1 , wse@xmath1 . as a result",
    ", the difference between the bulk indirect optical band gap and the monolayer direct optical band gap is found to be of @xmath68 only .",
    "our observation of close - lying direct and indirect emission lines invites further calculations of exciton - phonon coupling in mote@xmath1 and related systems , in order to correlate the values of the one - particle indirect band gap to the energy of the emission lines arising from indirect exciton recombination .",
    "interestingly , in bilayer mote@xmath1 , the competition between direct and indirect emission may be efficiently manipulated by external electric fields  @xcite , in particular using dual - gated field effect transistors .",
    "in addition , we have unveiled a sub - linear scaling of the photoluminescence intensity of monolayer mote@xmath1 with increasing exciton formation rate , which can be rationalized using a simple model based on exciton - exciton annihilation .",
    "this model also allowed us to obtain an order of magnitude estimate for the exciton lifetime in the linear regime that needs to be quantitatively confirmed by time - resolved photoluminescence measurements in the near - infrared range .",
