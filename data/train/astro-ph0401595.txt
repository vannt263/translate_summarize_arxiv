    "the two massive spiral galaxies of the local group ( lg ) , the milky way and andromeda ( m31 ) appear to have different histories . while tidal streams associated with minor mergers orbit both spirals ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the differing levels of interactions in the histories of m31 and the milky way may be reflected in the mean metallicity of their halo stars . m31 s halo is more metal - rich than that of the milky way , suggesting that mergers have had a substantial impact on m31 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we also can ask to what degree the different formation histories of m31 and the milky way are reflected in their systems of satellite galaxies . the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies of both systems are of special interest because these galaxies might be the unused basic building blocks in hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or , alternatively , what should have been larger systems whose structure and evolution was modifed by their proximity to giant spirals ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for a more detailed discussion of this subject , see @xcite .    while deep photometric studies over wide fields for the milky way dsph satellites reach below the oldest main sequence turnoffs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , allowing their star formation histories to be studied in detail , the distance of the m31 dsph subsystem has so far limited existing ground - based photometric studies to the upper red giant branch level ( e.g. , @xcite ) and space - based photometric studies to the horizontal branch level ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    "thus , only indirect conclusions can be derived for their star formation history and mean age .",
    "even at this level the m31 dsphs appear to have unique properties in that @xcite found that the m31 dsphs show a second parameter effect in their horizontal branch ( hb ) morphologies . after accounting for offsets due to mean metallicities ,",
    "the m31 dsphs appear to have systematically redder hb morphologies than the milky way s dsph companions .",
    "the origin of this second parameter effect is not clear , but explanations include a slightly ( i.e. , 2  gyr ) younger age of the m31 companions compared to their galactic equivalents ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this has also been suggested for cetus ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we study the stellar populations in the m31 dsphs based on properties of stars on the extended asymptotic giant branch ( eagb ) containing stars more luminous than the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "these include classical eagb carbon stars ( c stars ) , which trace intermediate - age - to - old ( 1 to 10 gyr ) stellar populations ( @xcite ) .",
    "this class of c star results from thermal pulses and subsequent mixing of freshly synthesized c into the envelopes of the eagb stars .",
    "the transition on the eagb from an oxygen rich ( m star ) to c star therefore depends both on the evolution and initial abundances of the star ; lower o abundances require less c to make c / o@xmath01 .    a second class of c star is present even in old globular cluster stellar populations with luminosities below the tip of the rgb .",
    "these stars are products of mass transfer from a c star onto its main sequence binary companion , which subsquently evolves up the rgb ( @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of c stars less luminous than the tip of the rgb is evidence for binary evolution in a stellar population , and is not tied to the age of the population in any simple way .",
    "these are spectroscopically identified as ch stars ; for a review of ch and other types of carbon and related evolved stars , see @xcite .",
    "the ch stars in turn are likely to be evolved versions of dwarf carbon ( dc ) stars ( @xcite ) , and we discuss implications of the presence of ch stars in m31 dsph companions in  3.4 .    while c stars are useful stellar population diagnostics , no systematic wide - field survey for c stars in the m31 dsph galaxies has been published so far .",
    "however , @xcite found two eagb c star candidates in and  ii , which led them to suggest that and  ii sustained star formation as an irregular - like galaxy for an extended time .",
    "@xcite spectroscopically confirmed an additional c star located below the rgb tip luminosity , which they interpreted as being a ch - like star , and probably a product of binary evolution of an undetermined age .",
    "however , their color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of and  ii confirms the presence of an agb and thus of an intermediate - age stellar population .",
    "it also provides a good example of the importance of spectroscopic confirmation in these small galaxies with few eagb star candidates ( see their fig .",
    "4 ) . in this paper",
    "we present a systematic photometric survey using the wiyn 3.5-m telescope for c star candidates in the andromeda dsph companions andiii , andv , andvi , and andvii , and in the comparatively isolated lg dsph galaxy cetus .",
    "new data for ngc147 as a calibrator for our survey technique will be presented as well .",
    "we observed the andromeda companions andiii , andv , andvi , and andvii , as well as the cetus dsph , with the minimo mosaic ccd camera at the 3.5 m wiyn telescope located at kitt peak .",
    "we used johnson v and i filters to obtain temperature and luminosity information for stars in the galaxies in order to construct a color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , while observations in two narrow - band filters centered on the tio and cn feature at 778 nm and 808 nm , respectively , were used to identify cool giant stars with enhanced carbon abundance .",
    "the use of a cn - tio filter combination is a well - established method for the reliable identification of c stars ( see @xcite ) .",
    "most of the galaxies were observed during an observing campaign on 2003 september 28 to 2003 october 1 .",
    "since all galaxies are at a similar distance , the exposure times were chosen to be 500s in each of the v and i filter , and 3@xmath1500s in each of the narrow band filters .",
    "there are two exceptions : the exposure times in the v and i band filters for and vii were split into 2@xmath1300s to avoid ccd blooming of bright stars present in the field of view .",
    "the narrow band exposures for and vi were obtained during an earlier observing run at wiyn on 2002 october 20 ; the exposure times are 2@xmath1500s per filter .",
    "in addition we observed the dwarf elliptical galaxy ngc147 to validate our ability to identify c stars .",
    "this galaxy is known to have a large number of c stars ( approximately 146 c stars have been found in the work of @xcite ) .",
    "although not always of photometric quality , the data are of superb quality in seeing .",
    "the typical seeing in the near infrared narrow - band filters was @xmath2 to @xmath3 and better ; the typical seeing in the broad band filters was @xmath4 , and never worse then @xmath5 .",
    "minimo at wiyn consists of a mosaic of two ccd chips with a total field of view of @xmath6 .",
    "the m31 dsph satellites with typical core radii of order of @xmath7 to @xmath8 thus conveniently fit onto a single chip , and have been centered on chip # 1 of the mosaic . the more extended galaxies ngc147 and cetus were placed at the center of the field of view of minimo .    during the 2003 campaign",
    "there was a problem with the minimo ccd readout electronics , resulting in strong random variations of the ccd s overscan level . before correcting the raw ccd frames with daily zero calibrations frames , we subtracted the overscan on a line - by - line basis .",
    "the variations in the overscan did not completely vanish , leaving residual additional background noise with an rms of order of @xmath9 counts .",
    "finally the images were corrected for illumination variations using dome flat fields .    for each galaxy ,",
    "all its images were registered to a common reference coordinate system .",
    "the three ( or two in the case of and vi ) exposures per narrow - band filter were stacked and used for cosmic - ray rejection . in the case of andviiwe also stacked the two v and i images . as an example we present a portion of the northern region of ngc147 in figure  [ fig_fits147 ] .",
    "point spread photometry was performed in all filters using the daophot implementation under iraf , resulting in photometric catalogs for each galaxy containing instrumental @xmath10 , @xmath11 , _ tio _ , and _",
    "filter magnitudes .",
    "since the weather was non - photometric during parts of our observing run , we did not attempt to observe photometric standard stars , and all magnitudes cited in this paper are instrumental magnitudes . in order to identify c stars , we only need differential photometry . for clarity ,",
    "however , we adopted @xmath11 , and @xmath12 zeropoints for each galaxy to match the magnitude and color of the blue side of the tip of the rgb with observed values ( from @xcite for cetus , from @xcite for andviiand andvi , from @xcite and @xcite for andvand andiii , respectively ; ngc147 is calibrated according to @xcite ) .",
    "we calibrated the zeropoint of the _",
    "cn @xmath13 tio _ color using the assumption that blue stars ( i.e. , bluer then the tip of the rgb ) should have _ cn @xmath13 tio _ @xmath14 , since spectra of warmer stars are expected to featureless in this wavelength region @xcite .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram for our test case , ngc147 , is shown in fig .  [ fig_ngc147 ] ( left ) .",
    "the intrinsically broad red giant branch ( rgb ) features prominently as it does in the wfpc2 observations of @xcite .",
    "we also find a prominent population of stars well above the tip of the rgb ( trgb ) .",
    "the right side of the same figure demonstrates the selection of carbon stars from the two - color ( @xmath12 vs.  _ cn @xmath13 tio _ ) diagram : stars with high carbon content ( and therefore low tio but strong cn molecule band absorption ) stand out in this plot and are selected according to the selection box ( _ cn @xmath13 tio _ @xmath15 0.25 ) .",

    "qualify as bona - fide c stars ; stars fainter than the trgb might be ch stars and thus are not intermediate age stellar population tracers .",
    "c stars selected this way are plotted in the cmd of ngc147 with filled circles .",
    "the substantial number of c star candidates ( 155 ) matches our expectation for this galaxy and compares well to the 146 c stars found by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the photometric selection , we construct the difference of the ccd images observed in the tio and cn filters to cross - identify the candidates on these images .",
    "an example of such a difference image is given in fig .",
    "[ fig_fits147zoom ] , where we zoom into the boxed region of fig .",
    "[ fig_fits147 ] .",
    "a visual inspection of the difference image of ngc147 leads us to estimate a roughly 10% incompleteness in our c star detections , which is compensated by roughly 10% false detections .",
    "we did not cross - identify each star in our ngc147 catalog with the difference image , but will do so for the dsph galaxies and will accept only c stars that appear both in our photometric catalog and stand out as a clear detection in the difference images .",
    "the fact that we find a slightly larger number of c stars in ngc147 than @xcite can be explained by our deeper photometry , better seeing conditions ( by at least @xmath19 in the narrow - band filters ) , and a larger field coverage .",
    "a comparison between the catalog of c stars of @xcite indeed reveals that most of the stars are in common with our catalog , with both false detections and misses of order of 10% in their as well as in our work .",
    "we thus increase the number of c stars in ngc147 to approximately 155 , and conclude that our selection efficiency of c star candidates is comparable to other surveys .",
    "due to the small absolute number and an improved crowding situation , we slightly loosen the photometric selection criterion for c stars in the dsphs , by requiring a _",
    "cn @xmath13 tio _ color of @xmath20mag and a luminosity of the c star candidates brighter than @xmath21mag .",
    "this selection will result in some false detections that we identified and removed during the cross - correlation with the difference image . with",
    "the small number of c star candidates per galaxy we can afford to double - check each individual star . reasons why stars might appear in the photometric catalog and not in the difference image turned out to be ( and are indeed limited to ) : misidentification of background galaxies , of cosmic ray trails ( not all cosmic rays are actually removed ) , stars affected by stray light or blooming in the vicinity of bright stars in the field of view , blends of two stars , or ccd defects .",
    "c star candidates that turned out to be false detections have been marked with open circles in the diagrams .",
    "stars that remain valid c star candidates after cross - identification are plotted with filled circles .",
    "the cmds and two - color diagrams of the observed m31 companions are presented in the same manner as for ngc147 in figs.[fig_and3 ] to [ fig_and7 ] .",
    "the color of the rgb depends on the metallicity of the galaxies , and we carefully adjusted the @xmath12 color boundary for the c star selection to avoid confusion with stars bluer than the tip of the rgb .",
    "the initial number of photometric detections of c star candidates that are _ not _ cross - identified in the difference image is very different for the four observed galaxies ( as indicated by the number of open circles in the diagrams ) , and turned out to be clearly correlated with the number of ( bright ) field stars on the ccd frame",
    ". the larger the number of bright foreground stars , the larger the number of false detections . after comparing the initial photometric c star candidates with the difference images ,",
    "we are left with a smaller set of reliable c star candidates in the galaxies .",
    "these are listed in table  [ tab_candidates ] .    depending on whether the bolometric luminosity of a c star candidate is brighter or clearly dimmer than the tip of the rgb",
    ", we classify it as a genuine c star ( `` c '' in table  [ tab_candidates ] ) or as an evolved dc star ( also called `` ch '' star ) , respectively .",
    "this selection criterion is unique for all but one star in andvii(see figure  [ fig_and7 ] ) , which has almost the same luminosity as the trgb .",
    "we classify this star as a c star candidate .",
    "this is justified as technically agb stars would have at least the same bolometric luminosity as the tip of the rgb . if we apply a correction in the form @xmath22 @xcite this star would clearly satisfy the bolometric luminosity criterion .",
    "the v- and i - band images and the tio- and cn - band images of andviwere taken during two different campaigns , and due to imperfect overlap of the two observations the total field covered of andviis limited to a @xmath23-wide stripe ( more than twice the core radius of @xmath24 , @xcite ) .",
    "the number of detected c stars for this galaxy therefore could be incomplete .",
    "the lack of radial velocity information for the c star candidates prohibits prevents us from verifying their membership in the m31 dsph companion galaxies .",
    "owing to the large angular distance of these galaxies from m31 , confusion with m31 halo c stars seems unlikely .",
    "indeed , all of our c star candidates are near the central regions of the dsphs , supporting the idea that younger ( that is , intermediate - age ) populations are primarily found in the central regions of dsphs ( see @xcite ) . the centralized location of the c stars and their narrow band colors makes it unlikely that we are seeing misidentified galactic foreground dc stars or backgrund galaxies . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we will assume that the c star candidates are members of the m31 dsph satellites .",
    "cetus was placed on the center of the minimo field of view , so there is no photometry available for a central @xmath25 wide stripe .",
    "the cmd and the two - color diagram of cetus are shown in figure  [ fig_cetus1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_cetus2 ] for the minimo ccd chip1 and chip2 , respectively .",
    "we can identify three objects with enhanced carbon abundance .",
    "one of them is a likely c star candidate , while two of them appear to be ch stars or similar objects .",
    "however , due to the gap in the minimo image we might miss approximately one ( @xmath26 ) c star in cetus .",
    "in good agreement with earlier studies ( @xcite ) we do not find clear evidence for an eagb in this galaxy .",
    "we successfully detected high probability candidates both for eagb c stars and ch stars in four m31 dsphs surveyed and the cetus dsph . in his reviews of the c star content of local group galaxies , ( @xcite )",
    "plots absolute magnitude of lg galaxies versus the logarithm of the number of c stars , carefully corrected for area coverage .",
    "we expanded this plot with new data points as shown in figure  [ fig_mvlnc ] using new results from the literature as summarized in table  [ tab_cstats ] .",
    "absolute @xmath10-band magnitudes were taken from @xcite .",
    "we consider only lg galaxies where surveys for c star candidates using the cn - tio narrow - band filter technique are expected to be reasonably complete . while several c stars have been found in milky way dsph galaxies @xcite , in some cases these are likely to be ch - stars , and the surveys often have incomplete areal coverage .",
    "we therefore include only a few milky way dsph satellites in figure  [ fig_mvlnc ] . for the smc and lmc we adopt the denis infrared survey results for the number of c stars @xcite .",
    "the galaxies in figure  [ fig_mvlnc ] show the well - known correlation between the absolute v - band luminosity of a galaxy ( i.e. , an approximate stellar mass ) and the total number of c stars . a useful tool to study the c star content of a galaxy is @xmath27@xmath28 , which measures the number of c stars per unit luminosity , and thus is a measure for the deviation from the m@xmath29-log(#c ) relation ( @xcite ) .",

    "we divide the galaxies in this sample into three classes , motivated by their morphology and  where known  their star formation history : ( i ) `` stellar fossil '' dsphs , where star formation ceased at very early times , ( ii ) dwarf irregular galaxies , transition - type galaxies , and dsphs where the period of star formation extends over a substantial fraction of cosmic time , and ( iii ) the de companions of m31 . of the galactic dsphs",
    "included in table  [ tab_cstats ] , a deep hst study of the stellar populations in leoi revealed that this galaxy was actively forming stars until 1gyr ago , with slower ongoing star formation until @xmath30300myr before the present @xcite .",
    "the situation is similar for fornax , where star formation stopped only @xmath30100 to 200myr in the past ( @xcite ; for recent reviews of the star formation histories of local group dwarf galaxies , see @xcite ) .",
    "these two galactic dsphs are in our second star forming galaxy category .",
    "all of the m31 des have large numbers of intermediate age stars , and low level star formation continues into the present in ngc  185 and ngc  205 ( @xcite ) .",

    "we can extract a general trend from fig .",
    "[ fig_mvlnc ] ( right panel ) : quiescent dsph galaxies contain a small number of c stars per v - band luminosity ( @xmath31 10@xmath32 ) , while those galaxies with active or recent star formation have a higher c star content ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the recent star formation in the fornax dsph makes this an outstanding galaxy in this plot .",
    "the normalized c star content of the three m31 des ( ngc147 , ngc205 , and ngc185 ) scatters around n@xmath34 , consistent with their large intermediate - age stellar populations .",
    "the cmds derived from wfpc2 imaging of andi , andii , andiii , andv , andvi , and andviido not extend much below the horizontal branch .",
    "they are therefore sensitive only to potential main sequence stars that have ages of @xmath351  gyr .",
    "none of these dsphs show evidence for star formation within this recent time frame ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the cmds presented by @xcite show that red clumps , typical of intermediate age stars , are unlikely to be present in the m31 dsphs , and that all the m31 dsphs have pronounced horizontal branches .",
    "comparisons of the number of normal eagb stars , seen as stars with spectral classes of m5 or later , to c stars also is a useful evolutionary diagnostic ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this ratio depends on both age and metallicity , with the relative number of c stars peaking for mean ages of @xmath361  gyr , and in all cases declining for ages greater than @xmath3010  gyr .",
    "unfortunately , the relevant ratio of @xmath37 is very difficult to derive for the m31 dsphs due to the very small number of c and m stars on the eagb and the presence of substantial numbers of red galactic foreground stars .",
    "an approximate value of @xmath37 can be obtained from our data by counting all stars redder than @xmath38mag ( to select @xmath39 spectral classes ; @xcite , @xcite ) and @xmath40 ( i.e. , brighter than the tip of the rgb ) , or @xmath41 .",
    "however , we avoid stars near to the saturation limit of the ccd , which are bright foreground stars , and objects whose peculiar colors indicate either that they are not stars or that a problem exists with the data .",
    "this approach is most effective when the density of eagb stars relative to foreground field stars is @xmath01 , as in ngc  147 .",
    "we counted all eagb @xmath39 stellar candidates in ngc147 both in the full field of view ( which will lead to an overestimation of @xmath42 due to field contamination ) , and within the central @xmath43 , which may cause us to slightly underestimate @xmath42 due to crowding effects .",
    "this approach yields @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the full field and the central region , respectively .",
    "given the expected uncertainty in @xmath37 of order of 0.02 we are in excellent agreement with the result of @xcite , who found @xmath46 for ngc  147 .",
    "since the m31 dsphs cover a relatively small region of the wiyn minimo camera ccd chips , we counted all stars fulfilling the conditions defined above in strips above and below the dsph targets .",
    "the resulting estimate of the foreground galactic star contamination at andviis too large relative to any population of eagb @xmath39 stars to get a meaningful estimate for @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , we find no m - star candidates in the cetus dsph , where this method yields @xmath472@xmath48 .",
    "we also see that since andiiiand andvhave no eagb c stars , they must have @xmath490 .    for andviithis method",
    "gives @xmath50 .",
    "we derive a relative fraction of c stars of @xmath51 or @xmath52 . for a galaxy with constant star formation",
    "we would expect @xmath53 at [ fe / h ] @xmath541.5 ( e.g. , fig.8 in @xcite ) .",
    "if we adopt a correction for the bolometric luminosity ( as in @xcite ) to select m stars , we would slightly find 38 m5 + stars despite the fact that we would include even redder stars with i - band luminosities fainter than the tip of the rgb by the selection , which mainly seems to reflect the uncertainty in the background subtraction . despite the considerable uncertainty in this ratio",
    ", we can say there is no indication for the presence of a significant younger intermediate - age ( @xmath553  gyr ) stellar population in andviibased on the models of @xcite .",
    "the presence of only one carbon star in andviand cetus , where we find no significant populations of eagb @xmath39-stars might be interpreted as a high @xmath37 ratio which would be unexpected for a small young stellar population . however , with only one candidate eagb star in each galaxy , a range of possibilities existis , including the production of an eagb c star via binary evolution .",
    "for example , c stars should be able to form from blue stragglers .",
    "furthermore , with only one eagb candidate per galaxy , spectroscopic confirmation of membership is essential .    in summary , only andviiin our sample shows evidence for a substantial eagb stellar population . in this case",
    "the low value of the @xmath37 ratio places these stars in the medium range of intermediate stellar ages , namely ages @xmath153 - 5  gyr .",
    "we began this investigation with the objective of comparing the dsph companions of m31 with those of the milky way , and of investigating whether the dsphs might be linked to the merger history of m31 .",
    "our data are consistent with the m31 dsphs having predominantly old stellar populations , where most star formation occurred at @xmath010  gyr in the past .",
    "the only clear dsph exception are andii(from @xcite work ) , and andvii , where significant star formation could have continued until 3 - 5  gyr ago . both the survey for eagb stars presented here and the study of horizontal branch morphologies by @xcite are consistent with the view that the majority of m31 s dwarf satellites are old systems .",
    "in particular , we do not find examples of dsphs with recent star formation activity , like the fornax or carina dsph satellites of the milky way .",
    "any connections between the dsphs and stellar halo of m31 remain tenuous . as @xcite emphasize , even though andiand andiiilie in the projected vicinity of the main m31 southwestern stellar stream , their low metallicities make dsphs unlikely to have been dominant contributors to the more metal rich components of the m31 halo .",
    "a further constraint comes from the @xcite analysis of their spectacularly deep _ hst _ cmd of the m31 stellar halo .",
    "they find that the significant metal - rich halo component of m31 has an age of 6 - 8  gyr , too young to be associated with any of the m31 dsph companions with the possible exception of the distant andviidsph ; see @xcite for deprojected distances and mean metallicities of the m31 dwarf companions .",
    "in terms of their star - formation histories , m31 s dsphs resemble the ancient galactic dsph companions as epitomized by the draco and ursa minor dsphs .",
    "of these two , draco appears to be dark - matter dominated ( e.g. , @xcite ) , whereas ursa minor may be undergoing tidal disruption ( e.g. , @xcite ) , so draco probably is the best comparison object .",
    "the m31 dsph companions evidently formed as independent objects that are not directly associated with the recently uncovered indications of interactions with m31 , which took place during the galactic `` middle ages '' some 68  gyr in the past .",
    "however , a possible environmental effect is seen in that only two m31 dsphs evidently supported extended periods of star formation , fewer than in the population of galactic dsphs located at similar distances from their spiral host galaxy .",
    "that present - day environment can not be the only agent becomes apparent when considering the similarly quiescent , isolated cetus dsph ( see @xcite for a more extensive discussion ) .",
    "an independent constraint on the importance of dsphs for the accretion history of m31 could be established by a study of the [ @xmath56/fe ] abundances in both m31 and its companions to see whether halo and dsphs exhibit similar differences as found for the milky way by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , because of the distance of m31 and its satellites only global [ fe / h ] values can be measured spectroscopically to date ( @xcite ) .",
    "the standard scenario of `` extrinsic '' c star formation implies that a main sequence star accretes material through roche - lobe overflow from its intrinsic eagb c star binary companion .",
    "this mechanism also is responsible for ch - stars ( see @xcite , @xcite ) and we can therefore consider the dc and ch - like stars to be tracers of similar effects of binary evolution .",
    "but what fraction of stars in a stellar population will suffer from pollution severe enough to turn them into c stars ?",
    "this number depends both on the binary fraction , and the distribution of binary star semi - major axes , metallicity , and age ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . a `` hard '' binary system with a orbital separation smaller",
    "then a typical agb radius might disrupt the evolving agb star before a third dredge - up is able to turn the agb star into a c star .",
    "binary - orbit shrinking due to close three - body encounters in dense globular clusters could reduce the specific frequency of dc stars @xcite .",
    "thus the frequency of dc and ch stars is expected to depend also on the environment , and we should find relatively more dc / ch stars in low density dsph galaxies with old stellar populations than in globular clusters .    to estimate the relative number of ch - stars in the uncrowded dsph galaxies , we counted the number of rgb stars brighter than the @xmath21mag limit of our c star survey .",
    "the ratio between numbers of ch - stars , which we approximate as evolved dc stars , and rgb stars is an approximate measure of the relative fraction of dc stars in the stellar populations of these galaxies .",
    "however , the small number statistics of the rare c - rich stars introduces substantial uncertainties into this ratio . in table",
    "[ tab_dcfrequency ] we present the number of rgb stars and ch star candidates , as well as the estimated percentage of ch stars for the galaxies surveyed .",
    "we assume that all of our candidates are ch stars in the m31 dsphs .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of these stars is essential to confirm their membership by their radial velocities and verify that they are c - rich objects .    to improve the statistics , we simply sum up all of the rgb stars and ch stars to obtain a first estimate of the dsph ch star frequency .",
    "we find @xmath300.3% of the dsph s stars to be ch stars that could have originated from dc stars which were contaminated during the evolution of a binary stellar system .",
    "the frequency of ch stars in globular clusters remains to be established since such stars are very rare ( see @xcite ) .    in",
    "ngc147 we count ch stars in the same way as we did for the dsphs between the tip of the rgb and @xmath57 , and also count rgb stars in the same luminosity range . this way we derive a slightly higher ch stars frequency of @xmath58% , which might be unreliable since strong crowding might become important for the selection of fainter carbon - rich stars and confusion with genuine c stars at the bright end of the selection might lead to an overestimation of the number of ch stars .",
    "we present results from a photometric survey for c stars and related carbon - rich stars in the andiii , andv , andvi , andvii , and cetus dsph galaxies carried out with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope .",
    "similar data also were obtained for the de galaxy ngc  147 , previously surveyed for c stars by @xcite , as a check on our technique .",
    "the small number of c stars found among the m31 dsph satellite galaxies implies that they contain predominantly old stellar populations . aside from andiiand",
    "especially andvii , where star formation may have been active as recently as 3 - 5  gyr in the past , the andiii , andv , and andvidsphs have not supported significant star formation within the past @xmath3010  gyr .",
    "the stellar populations of the m31 dsphs both are older and more metal - poor than the intermediate - age m31 stellar halo components .",
    "we conclude that the dsph satellites are an early legacy of the time before the prominent m31 merger events that occurred about 6 - 8  gyr in the past . the lack of a connection to the m31 `` middle ages '' merger is further supported by the similarities in stellar populations between the m31 satellites and relatively isolated cetus dsph , as well as the galactic dsphs with old populations , such as the draco or umi dsphs .    the frequency of c stars in the m31 de companion ngc  147 from our data and the recent study by @xcite , places it at levels the actively star forming magellanic clouds and fornax or leo  i , galactic dsphs where star formation continued to within @xmath301  gyr of the present .",
    "while the m31 des structurally resemble scaled up dsph systems , they have very different star formation histories than most of the m31 dsphs .",
    "this serves to emphasize the profound differences in stellar population characteristics among the m31 dsph satellites .",
    "the low luminosity dsphs are predominantly stellar fossils , while the des made many of their stars 5 - 10  gyr in the past .",
    "these de galaxies therefore may be associated with some of the more pronounced merger features in m31 , as others have suggested on the basis of their structures and mean stellar metallicities ( @xcite ) .",
    "the andviidsph is neither a de - like object nor a collection of primarily ancient stars , and instead resembles galactic dsphs which experienced star formation for more than @xmath305  gyr after their formation .",
    "we also found that roughly @xmath59% of the stars in dsphs to be candidate ch stars , products of binary evolution .",
    "future investigations of dc / ch fractions in globular clusters will allow to investigate the impact of a dense environment on binary evolution .",
