    "paradoxically , the `` jet quenching '' phenomenon observed at rhic precedes by many years the first measurements of jets in heavy - ion collisions . the spectacular suppression of large-@xmath0 single - inclusive pion production in central au ",
    "au collisions has been widely interpreted as coming from the energy loss of hard partons in a dense medium ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , these data   as well as more differential measurements such as di - hadron and photon - hadron correlations   only hardly inform us on quark and gluon multiple scattering processes and medium - induced gluon radiation in quark - gluon plasma ( for a review on the subject , we refer the reader to  @xcite ) .",
    "measuring hadronic distributions inside reconstructed jets in heavy - ion collisions should therefore be key in order to access the underlying dynamics of jet quenching .",
    "using recent advances in jet algorithm techniques  @xcite , preliminary measurements on inclusive jet spectra have been reported lately in au ",
    "au collisions at @xmath1  gev by the star collaboration  @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "various jet observables have been investigated such as the angular distribution of jet average multiplicities  @xcite , multiplicity distributions  @xcite or inclusive momentum spectra  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of various parton showers in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite should also allow for a more systematic exploration of jet observables and their medium - modifications .",
    "as for any hard process in heavy - ion collisions , the precise knowledge of the expected baseline in @xmath2@xmath2  collisions becomes crucial in order to properly quantify the effects of quark - gluon plasma formation on jet physics . over the past twenty years , significant progresses have been achieved in order to improve predictions on various jet observables . in particular , the modified leading logarithmic approximation ( mlla ) in perturbative qcd has been successfully tested from @xmath3 to hadronic collisions , in the calculation  @xcite . ]",
    "@xcite .    to this sake",
    ", we investigate in this paper the collimation of the average multiplicity inside a quark and a gluon jet as a function of the jet energy scale .",
    "the collimation is characterized by the cone aperture of the sub - jet @xmath4 that contains a fraction @xmath5 of the jet average multiplicity .",
    "let @xmath6 be the multiplicity in a jet of energy @xmath7 and opening angle @xmath8 , and @xmath9 that of the sub - jet of opening angle @xmath10 inside this jet , @xmath4 is determined by solving the multiplicity collimation equation , @xmath11 in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla )  @xcite , the solid angle @xmath12 containing half of the average multiplicity of the jet @xmath8 decreases with the jet hardness @xmath13 approximately like @xmath14 , such that at high energy scales the bulk of the total multiplicity is concentrated at smaller solid angles around the direction of propagation of the jet . in this paper , we extend this calculation to the mlla by incorporating all corrections of order @xmath15 , which partially guarantee energy conservation and account for the running of the coupling constant @xmath16 in intra - jet cascades .",
    "the treatment of such a complicated task in perturbative qcd simplifies tremendously thanks to the angular ordering of the successive emission of soft gluons , which leads to simplified jet evolution equations  @xcite . at the end of the cascading process",
    ", the collinear cut - off parameter @xmath17 can be taken as low as @xmath18 ( the so - called limiting spectrum approximation ) , and the local parton - hadron duality ( lphd ) hypothesis  @xcite can then be advocated so as to determine hadronic distributions .    within the same formalism , the collimation of jets has also been determined in heavy - ion collisions by inserting medium - modified splitting functions , in which the soft gluon emission is arbitrarily enhanced from a toy qcd - inspired model  @xcite .",
    "although more realistic approaches treating parton energy loss in medium - modified fragmentation have been proposed  ( see e.g.  @xcite for a review ) , the use of this model was motivated by the fact that analytic calculations can more easily be performed .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [",
    "se : framework ] , the calculation of the average multiplicity in a sub - jet @xmath19 is carried out at mlla , which eventually allows for solving numerically the above collimation equation . in section  [",
    "se : results ] , our results are compared to the lla predictions in the vacuum and medium effects on jet collimation are discussed .",
    "consider a jet produced in a high energy collision , initiated by a parton of flavour @xmath20 and energy @xmath7 , with an opening angle @xmath8 which separates it from other jets . inside this jet , a sub - jet initiated by a parton @xmath21 and energy @xmath22",
    "is defined by the opening angle @xmath23 .",
    "the sub - jet multiplicity @xmath24 , i.e. the mean number of hadrons produced inside the angular range @xmath23 of the jet @xmath20 , is given by  @xcite @xmath25 which determines the correlation between the jet axis and the average multiplicity of the sub - jet . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nconv ] ) , @xmath26 is the probability to find a parton @xmath21 with energy fraction @xmath27 and virtuality @xmath28 inside the jet initiated by the parton @xmath20 , and @xmath29 is the bare average multiplicity in a sub - jet of energy @xmath30 and opening angle @xmath10 . since soft particles are less sensible to the energy balance in intra - jet cascades , the correlation between the energy flux and the sub - jet multiplicity disappears . as a consequence , the measured average multiplicity @xmath31 factorizes in the form  @xcite @xmath32 after the taylor expansion of @xmath26 in eq .",

    ", @xmath4 has been determined using @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "although the trends are similar , @xmath87 turns out to be larger at mlla than at lla , indicating that corrections following from energy conservation and the running of the coupling constant increase the size of the angular distribution , i.e. making jets less collimated at mlla .",
    "as expected , mlla corrections are larger at low jet energy scales and closer to lla at asymptotic energies as the anomalous dimension vanishes .",
    "also , mlla corrections prove slightly larger for a gluon than for quark jet , yet the difference is rather small .",
    "more remarkably , the difference between lla and mlla predictions is somewhat larger for smaller values of the parameter @xmath5 . at low scales , @xmath91 , @xmath92",
    "is increased by @xmath93 from lla to mlla for @xmath89 , but only by @xmath94 when @xmath5 is set to @xmath90 .",
    "these predictions could be tested at the tevatron and the lhc , by measuring jets of transverse momenta say @xmath95  gev and angular aperture @xmath96 , corresponding to energy scales @xmath97 .",
    "lower scales , for which mlla predictions are largest , could even be reached at rhic energy .",
    "let us now discuss how the multiplicity collimation of jets produced in heavy - ion collisions could be distorted by quark - gluon plasma formation .",
    "preliminary predictions have been made by enhancing the infrared gluon emission by @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( respectively , @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) and compared to the mlla vacuum expectations ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath54 are somehow arbitrary ; these numbers were chosen in  @xcite in order to reproduce the magnitude of single - inclusive pion suppression data in au ",
    "au collisions at rhic .",

    "the typical values for the angular aperture @xmath87 is increased by roughly factor @xmath103@xmath104 as compared to jets produced in the vacuum , depending on the values of @xmath105 and @xmath54 .",
    "this observable could be measured in heavy - ion collisions at rhic and at the lhc provided the background from the underlying event can be safely removed from the jet signal , using the techniques discussed in  @xcite .",
    "on top of an increased of the total multiplicity , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : mllaform ] ) , jets produced in heavy - ion collisions appear to be less collimated than in the vacuum , according to the model @xcite used here .",
    "this observation seems qualitatively consistent with the @xmath106-broadening of the jet multiplicity distributions studied in  @xcite , yet this jet shape is directed related to the collimation of _ energy _ rather than to the collimation of multiplicity considered here .",
    "the calculations of the medium - modified collimation of multiplicity discussed in this section are not meant to be quantitative , given the rather primitive model used to describe the process of parton multiple scattering and induced - gluon radiation .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative prediction of a reduced collimation of jets produced in heavy - ion collisions is expected to hold in more realistic calculations .",
    "the procedure presented in this paper in order to compute the collimation of multiplicity at mlla from given splitting functions could for instance be used in the future to provide more accurate predictions in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "in this paper we have considered the collimation of multiplicity distributions inside jets produced at high energy colliders . the calculation performed at lla in  @xcite has been extended to mlla accuracy by taking full care of all terms of order @xmath15 in the jet evolution .",
    "the sub - jet containing a fraction @xmath5 of the total jet multiplicity has been found to widen at mlla as compared to previous results at lla .",
    "the difference between lla and mlla expectations are largest at small jet energy scales and could be tested at present ( rhic , tevatron ) and future ( lhc ) hadronic colliders .",
    "the same analysis was performed by using the medium - modified splitting funtions introduced in  @xcite , which enhance the soft gluon radiation of a highly virtual parton traveling through quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the calculation has also been performed at mlla and compared to the vacuum expectations .",
    "results indicate that jets produced in heavy - ion collisions are expected to be less collimated than in the vacuum , even though quantitative predictions using more realistic medium - modified splitting functions are yet to be performed .",
