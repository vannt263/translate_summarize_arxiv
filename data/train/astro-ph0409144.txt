    "the classification of radio galaxies into fris and friis is morphological in origin . whereas friis have knotty jets and radio lobes that end in bright hot - spots , the less powerful fris have smooth jets and large lobes that grow dimmer outward .",
    "the fri / frii transition is relatively sharp in terms of radio luminosity , with sources at @xmath0 ( whz@xmath1sr@xmath1 ) being almost exclusively friis , and sources at lower radio luminosities possessing fri morphology @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the fri / frii transition radio luminosity , @xmath2 , is an increasing function of the optical luminosity , @xmath3 , of the host galaxy , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the separation of fris and friis in the radio - optical luminosity plane is surprisingly sharp , and several explanations have been offered including environmental differences @xcite , different physical processes @xcite and differences in agn parameters such as black hole mass and accretion rate @xcite .",
    "here we investigate the influence of black hole mass and accretion rate on the fri / frii dichotomy .",
    "spectra were obtained with the double spectrograph on the palomar 5 m , and sources having @xmath5 whz@xmath1sr@xmath1 ( assuming @xmath6 kms@xmath1mpc@xmath1 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) were selected .",
    "the spectra cover the regions around the ca h&k @xmath93934,3969  and the mgi@xmath10 @xmath115175  absorption .",
    "template stars were observed and broadened with gaussians and fit to the galaxy spectra using a direct fitting routine @xcite .",
    "the best - fit velocity dispersions were converted to black hole masses using the @xmath12@xmath13 relation @xcite . from the literature , but also from wide - slit spectra , we obtain the luminosity in the narrow [ oii]3727 and/or [ oiii]5007  emission lines .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the radio and the narrow - line [ oii ] luminosity as a function of black hole mass for some of the galaxies in our sample . fris and friis separate fairly well , populating different regions of the diagrams .",
    "the [ oii ] narrow - line luminosity probes the total luminosity in the narrow - line region @xcite , and taking into account a covering factor , the narrow line luminosity scales with the photoionizing luminosity , and hence the accretion rate .",
    "the separation of fris and friis in these diagrams may therefore imply that , at a given black hole mass , fris accrete less efficiently ( or accrete less matter ) than friis .",
    "sources that do not follow the general separation so well may be low - excitation radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "one such example is 3c 35 , which we find to have much weaker [ oiii ] than [ oii ] . in this case",
    "the environment , rather than accretion rate and black hole mass , may have determined the radio morphology of the source .",
