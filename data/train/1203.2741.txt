    "in this note we discuss the following question : when is the julia set of a rational map connected but not locally - connected ? we propose some conjectures and develop a model of non - locally - connected julia sets in the case of infinitely renormalizable quadratic polynomials , a situation where one hopes to find a precise answer .",
    "the question of local connectivity of the julia set has been studied extensively for quadratic polynomials , but there is still no complete characterization of when a quadratic polynomial has a connected and locally - connected julia set . in degree @xmath0",
    ", the question reduces to the precise cases where the polynomial has a siegel disk or is infinitely renormalizable .",
    "j. milnor proposed in his lecture  @xcite a quantitative condition to get a non - locally - connected julia set which is infinitely satellite renormalizable .",
    "it follows the work of a. douady and d. e. k. srensen : in @xcite a description of the topological nature of a non - locally - connected julia set is given , and some examples in the infinitely satellite renormalizable case are obtained .",
    "nevertheless , the argument in @xcite is by continuity and gives no explicit condition .",
    "g. levin gave afterwards such a condition in @xcite ( see also theorem[thm de levin ] ) . in section [ s : infinitely ] of this note , we present a model of what the structure of the post - critical set in that setting should be ( it was originally created by x. buff ) .    in a previous work , we considered polynomials of higher degrees . here",
    "we present an example ( section  [ s : example ] ) where the local connectivity can be deduced by renormalization .",
    "the situation is even more complicated for rational maps .",
    "indeed , there are examples of rational maps with cremer points such that the julia set is locally - connected @xcite .",
    "it seems more difficult to find examples of non - locally - connected julia sets in the space of rational maps .",
    "nevertheless they exist , and can be easily obtained by `` tuning '' from polynomials . from the way those rational maps are constructed , the natural question appears to be how much a rational map has to be related to a polynomial so that its julia set is not locally - connected ?",
    "are polynomials pathological rational maps ? in all cases presented here , when the rational map or polynomial has a connected but not locally - connected julia set , a criterion is verified .",
    "we call it `` douady - sullivan criterion '' since it has been used the first time by them .    0.51em",
    "_ aknowledgment _ : the authors would like to thank the referee for his thorough reading of the manuscript and his comments that helped improve the manuscript .",
    "discussions with x. buff , a. chritat and y. yin , as well as remarks of d. cheraghi and h. inou inspired parts of this paper .",
    "recall that the _ julia set _ of a rational map @xmath1 is the minimal totally invariant ( under @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) compact set containing at least @xmath3 points .",
    "its complement in the riemann sphere , called the _",
    "fatou set _",
    ", is an open set whose components are all eventually periodic by sullivan s theorem .",
    "when the julia set is connected , these components are all topological disks . inside each of the periodic components the return map is conjugate near the boundary to some simple model ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "if the boundary of the component is locally - connected , the model extends to the boundary ( by carathodory s theorem ) .",
    "one of the main reasons to consider the question of local connectivity for julia sets is to get the model on the boundary .",
    "recall that the models are given by the following maps from the unit disc to itself :    * @xmath4 , the _ attracting case _ , * @xmath5 where @xmath6 , the _ parabolic case _ ,",
    "* @xmath7 , the _ siegel case _ ( the corresponding fatou component is then called a _",
    "siegel disk _ ) .",
    "in what follows we will always assume that the julia sets considered are connected , even if it is not explicitly mentioned .",
    "[ l : decomposition ] ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th 4.4 ) the julia set of a rational map is locally - connected if and only if the boundary of each fatou component is locally - connected and for any @xmath8 only finitely many fatou components have diameter greater than @xmath9 .",
    "hence , the question of whether each fatou component has a locally - connected boundary is fundamental for a rational map . for a polynomial ,",
    "the boundary of the unbounded fatou component is the whole julia set .",
    "nevertheless , it is an interesting question to know if one can deduce some result looking only at the bounded fatou components and their size",
    ". we will now give an answer to this question .",
    "for polynomials let us recall the following result  @xcite :    [ ry]any bounded periodic fatou component of a polynomial containing a critical point is a jordan domain .",
    "the following `` classical '' conjecture is the natural extension of this result to any bounded fatou component .",
    "it has been proved recently in many cases by m. shishikura .",
    "the boundary of a periodic siegel disk of a polynomial is always a jordan curve .    a periodic point in the julia set",
    "is called a _ cremer point _ if the derivative of the return map at the fixed point is @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "let us recall the following result ( a proof will be sketched in section  [ s : cremersiegel ] )    if a polynomial has either a cremer periodic point or a periodic siegel disk with no critical point on the boundary ( of the cycle generated by the disk ) , then its julia set is not locally - connected .",
    "this answers the question trivially since in the cremer case there are no bounded fatou components .",
    "one can also construct non - locally - connected julia sets with fatou components that are jordan domains whose diameter tends to zero .",
    "indeed , it is enough to take a polynomial containing both an attracting cycle and a cremer point such that the orbit of the critical points does not accumulate on the boundary of the attracting basin",
    ". then the attracting basin and all its pre - images are jordan domains . moreover , using the `` shrinking lemma '' ( see  @xcite prop .",
    "a.3 or @xcite section @xmath12 ) in the complement of the post - critical set ( @xmath13 where @xmath14 ) it is easy to see that the diameter of these jordan domains goes to zero .",
    "such examples are easy to find in cubic families with one attracting fixed point ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "there we can find copies of the mandelbrot set ( the connectedness locus for the quadratic family ) in which we can choose a doubly renormalizable restriction containing a cremer point ( we will define renormalizable below in definition  [ d : renorm ] ) .    in the light of such examples ,",
    "the previous question appears to be a naive one but its original motivation leads to the following less naive question :    let @xmath15 be a quadratic polynomial having a siegel disk whose boundary is a jordan curve containing the critical point .",
    "is the julia set locally - connected ?    to our knowledge",
    "there is no known counter - example , and in higher degrees the situation is even more complicated .",
    "one could imagine to build a cubic polynomial from a quadratic one that is non - locally - connected the following way : one would have the julia set of a quadratic polynomial with a siegel disk without the critical point on its boundary sitting in the julia set of a cubic polynomial .",
    "the critical point has to lie on some hairs around the siegel disk .",
    "the idea is then to deform the cubic polynomial in the space of cubic polynomials in order to put the other critical point on the boundary of the siegel disk .",
    "this kind of map has been considered when the critical point belongs to strict pre - images of the siegel disk in  @xcite .",
    "one would get in our case a polynomial with a siegel disk containing one critical point on its boundary and another critical point on some hairs stemming from the siegel disk .",
    "nevertheless , it is not clear that having one critical point on the boundary of the siegel disk will not force the hairs to disappear . indeed , in the light of douady - sullivan criterion ( see section  [ s : conj ] ) , the non - local - connectivity seems to appear when the map presents some injectivity , but here around the boundary of the siegel disk the map is no longer injective , so there is no reason to expect the boundary to be topologically wild .",
    "[ q1 ] does there exist a non - renormalizable polynomial , of degree @xmath16 , with a siegel disk containing at least a critical point on its boundary and whose julia set is not locally - connected ?",

    "then @xmath25 and for any closed connected set @xmath26 , @xmath27 is also connected .",
    "yoccoz proved that a quadratic polynomial that is finitely renormalizable and has only repelling periodic points has a locally - connected julia set . in higher degree",
    ", the following result appears to be the most general known result .",
    "[ kvs ] the julia set of a non - renormalizable polynomial without indifferent periodic points is locally - connected provided it is connected .",
    "one wonders if there is a way to combine previous results in order to justify the following :    [ q2]is the julia set of a polynomial locally - connected provided that it is not infinitely renormalizable , it has no cremer points and there is a critical point on the boundary of any cycle of siegel disks ?",
    "question  [ q1 ] justifies partially question  [ q2 ] . here",

    ", one can construct a puzzle in the basins of parabolic cycles .",
    "therefore , the proof of  [ kvs ] ( see  @xcite ) will adapt to the case of parabolic cycles as soon as one can construct with this puzzle a `` box mapping '' .",
    "this can fail when the map is `` parabolic - like '' ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the recent work of l. lomonaco ( @xcite ) on parabolic - like maps should take care of this case .    in the finitely - remormalizable case",
    ", the proof proceeds by induction and uses the homeomorphism given by the straightening theorem ( @xcite ) .",
    "theorem [ cubiclc ] presented in next section is an example of this method .",
    "finally , let us point out that the case of infinitely renormalizable polynomials is much more subtle .",
    "kahn , levin , lyubich , mcmullen , van strien ... gave conditions to obtain infinitely renormalizable quadratic polynomials with locally - connected julia sets .",
    "douady and srensen gave examples of non - locally - connected infinitely renormalizable quadratic polynomials .",
    "we will discuss infinitely renormalizable polynomials in section  [ s : infinitelyds ] and in section  [ s : infinitely ] .",
    "we would like to end this section by a concrete example .",
    "we prove local connectivity of the julia set of a polynomial knowing that it is renormalizable and that the small julia set is locally - connected :    [ cubiclc ] let @xmath28 with @xmath16 and @xmath29 , be the family of polynomials of degree @xmath30 , with one fixed critical point of maximal multiplicity ( up to affine conjugacy ) .",
    "assume that the julia set @xmath31 is connected .",
    "if @xmath32 is renormalizable of lowest period @xmath33 around the `` free '' critical point @xmath34 , we will denote by @xmath35 the unique quadratic polynomial to which the restriction of @xmath36 is conjugate .",
    "then the julia set @xmath31 is locally - connected if and only if either @xmath32 is not renormalizable or @xmath37 is locally - connected",
    ".    first recall that if @xmath32 or equivalently @xmath35 is geometrically finite ( _ i.e. _ if the post - critical set intersects the julia set at finitely many points ) , then the julia sets are locally - connected by the result of  @xcite .",
    "we recall in the following the construction of a graph `` adapted '' to the dynamics of the map @xmath32 ( as presented in  @xcite ) . given a graph @xmath38 the connected component of @xmath39 containing @xmath40 ,",
    "is called the puzzle piece of depth @xmath41 containing @xmath40 and is denoted by @xmath42 .",

    "either the intersection @xmath45 reduces to @xmath46 , 2 .   or the end of the critical point is periodic : @xmath47 such that for all @xmath41 large enough @xmath48 is quadratic like .",
    "it follows that the map is renormalizable : there exist @xmath49 and a quasi - conformal homeomorphism @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a neighborhood of the filled julia set of @xmath35 and @xmath52 conjugates the maps where it is defined .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath53 either the impression @xmath54 reduces to @xmath46 or to an iterated pre - image of the critical impression @xmath55 .",
    "proof of the claim : this result follows from the construction of the graph done in  @xcite that we recall now . denote by @xmath56 the immediate basin of attraction of @xmath57 .",
    "the graph @xmath38 under consideration is the union of two cycles of rays and two equipotentials .",
    "more precisely , we take in @xmath56 the cycle generated by the internal ray of angle @xmath58 of the form @xmath59 ( for any @xmath60 large enough ) , the landing point is a repelling cycle , we then take the cycle of external rays landing at this repelling cycle ( on the boundary of @xmath56 ) , for the equipotentials we take any internal equipotential ( in @xmath56 ) and any external equipotential .",
    "it is not difficult to see ( compare  @xcite ) that any point of the julia set lying in some sector @xmath61 ( defined below ) is surrounded by a non - degenerate annulus of the from @xmath62 ( _ i.e. _ lies in the central component of such an annulus ) .",
    "the sector @xmath61 ( with @xmath63 ) is defined as follows . consider the curve @xmath64 formed by the internal rays in @xmath56 of angles @xmath65 and @xmath66 and the external rays landing at the corresponding point , @xmath67 is the connected component of the complement of this curve in @xmath68 that contains the internal ray of angle @xmath57 .",
    "we need to show that any point of the julia set will fall under iteration in this domain , then using yoccoz s theorem ( see  @xcite ) we will get the announced claim . any point of",
    "the filled julia set belongs to a limb and limbs are sent to limbs ( except for the critical limb ) .",
    "therefore , any point not in the critical limb will fall under iteration in @xmath61 .",
    "if the critical limb is fixed then it is attached by a fixed ray and already belongs to @xmath61 .",
    "otherwise , we look at the limb of the critical value and its orbit will fall in @xmath61 since the angle of the critical limb is necessarily periodic ( indeed the sector of the wake containing the critical value has angular opening multiplied by @xmath30 as long as it is not in the wake containing the critical point ) .    0.5em as a direct consequence of yoccoz s result , if the map is not renormalizable , the whole julia set is locally - connected .",
    "we will now consider the case where @xmath32 is renormalizable .",
    "0.5em @xmath43 _ if the map @xmath32 is renormalizable then we are in case @xmath0 of the claim  : _ let @xmath69 denote the filled julia set of the renormalization @xmath36 containing the critical point @xmath34",
    ". we can choose @xmath58 such that the graph previously constructed does not cut @xmath69 .",
    "indeed , the graph is forward invariant and any intersection point between @xmath38 and @xmath69 would be iterated to a point of the periodic cycle on the boundary of @xmath56 . hence ,",
    "if @xmath69 intersects @xmath70 under a cycle , it is enough to choose @xmath58 of a different period .",
    "now , every puzzle piece @xmath71 contains the entire set @xmath69 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath69 is periodic of some period @xmath33 , the puzzle pieces @xmath71 are all mapped by @xmath72 to @xmath73 as a quadratic like map ( since @xmath74 for large @xmath41 by the proof of the claim ) so the critical point does nt escape .",

    "@xmath43 _ now we can assume that @xmath75 by taking the renormalization of lowest period .",
    "the filled in julia set @xmath76 is the union of @xmath69 and  limbs \" of it .",
    "_    there are two rays landing at the non - separating fixed point ( called @xmath77 ) of @xmath36 in @xmath69 ( the fixed point corresponding by the conjugacy to the @xmath78 fixed point ) and exactly two rays landing at the pre - image of @xmath77 by @xmath79 ( preimage in @xmath69 ) . indeed ,",
    "if there would be more than two rays landing at @xmath77 , then they define some new sector invariant by @xmath36 and it should contain some part of @xmath69 , which gives the contradiction ( the point @xmath77 would be separating ) .",
    "these two rays separate @xmath76 in three components , one containing @xmath56 , denoted by @xmath80 , one containing neither @xmath56 nor @xmath69 , denoted by @xmath81 . the iterated pre - images of @xmath81 by @xmath36 and @xmath80 are called the limbs of @xmath69 . a connected component of @xmath82 except @xmath80 is mapped to a connected component of @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , any limb different from @xmath80 is an ( iterated ) pre - image of @xmath81 .",
    "0.5em @xmath43 _ for any point @xmath83 , for any neighborhood @xmath84 of @xmath40 , there exist a sub - neighborhood @xmath85 such that @xmath86 has finitely many connected components .",

    "_    since @xmath87 is locally - connected , the image @xmath69 is also locally - connected .",

    "we prove now that the diameter of the limbs of @xmath69 tends to @xmath57 so that only finitely many of them enter @xmath51 without being totally included in @xmath51 . for this purpose",
    "we prove that the diameter of @xmath89 tends to @xmath57 , meaning that for any @xmath8 only finitely many of them have diameter greater than @xmath9 .",
    "for this , we shall use yoccoz s puzzle for @xmath87 .",
    "this puzzle is defined when the non - separating fixed point @xmath90 is repelling ( _ i.e _ when both fixed points are repelling ) .",
    "therefore we first consider the case when the fixed point @xmath91 is not repelling .",
    "if it is attracting or parabolic then the map @xmath1 is geometrically finite and the result follows from  @xcite . if the point is an irrationally indifferent fixed point for @xmath35 , then its image by the conjugacy will have the same rotation number ( see  @xcite ) . in the cremer case",
    "both julia sets ( are at the same time of cremer type and ) are non - locally - connected . in the siegel case , if the critical point is not on the boundary of the siegel disk for one map so it is for the other by the conjugacy , and both julia sets are non - locally - connected .",
    "if the critical points are on the boundary of the respective siegel disks then the post - critical sets stay in the boundary of the siegel disks and remain away from the other fixed point and their first pre - images .",
    "therefore @xmath92 and then using the so called shrinking lemma ( expansion in @xmath93 ) , the diameter of @xmath89 goes to @xmath57 .",
    "now we consider the case where the @xmath91 fixed point of @xmath35 is repelling . the graph @xmath94 defining the yoccoz s puzzle for @xmath35 is the union of the external rays landing at the point @xmath91 and some external equipotential .",
    "let us define a new graph @xmath95 for @xmath32 which is a combination of @xmath38 and the cycle of external rays landing at the image of @xmath91 by the conjugacy @xmath52 .",
    "the puzzle pieces have the same combinatorics for the map @xmath32 and for the map @xmath35 using the conjugacy @xmath52 that allows to identify puzzle pieces .",
    "two cases appear in yoccoz s result : either the map @xmath35 is non - renormalizable and then the nest of puzzle pieces shrink to points , or it is renormalizable and then it is easy to see that the orbit of @xmath57the critical point of @xmath35is bounded away from the @xmath78 fixed point and its pre - image @xmath96 . in the second case ,",
    "using the conjugacy @xmath52 one obtains the result applying the shrinking lemma since the post - critical set of @xmath32 will be disjoint from the limb @xmath81 . in the first case we get a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath40 such that the intersection with @xmath31 is connected since the diameter of the puzzle pieces in a nest for @xmath32 shrinks to @xmath57 also .",
    "0.5em @xmath43 _ conversely we assume now that the julia set of @xmath32 is locally - connected .",
    "we prove that the julia set @xmath69 of any renormalization of @xmath32 around @xmath34 is also locally - connected .",
    "_    let @xmath97 denote the riemann map of the complement of @xmath76 ( which in fact coincides with the bttcher coordinate ) .",
    "then @xmath98 extends continuously to the boundary .",

    "indeed , these two landing points are in @xmath69 and the landing point of any external ray in the interval between @xmath102 and @xmath103 is not in @xmath69 which is a connected set .",
    "then we can define a map from the unit circle to @xmath69 as follows . for @xmath104 , define @xmath105 . by the previous discussion , this map @xmath106 is well defined and continuous . therefore @xmath69 is locally - connected as the continuous image of the unit circle .",
    "_ which fatou components of a rational map are jordan domains",
    "? _    the property of having a bounded fatou component has no meaning for a rational map .",
    "the question is which properties of the bounded fatou components of polynomials are used in the proofs of local connectivity results .",
    "before we consider this issue , it is natural to ask if there exist rational maps with connected julia sets but with fatou components whose boundaries are not locally - connected .",
    "we should consider only rational maps that are sufficiently far from polynomials .",

    "indeed , rational maps of degree  @xmath0 with a fixed parabolic point at infinity of multiplier @xmath107 are conjugate to quadratic polynomials on their julia set ( except in some special cases ) but can not be conjugate on a _ neighborhood _ of their julia set simply because of the presence of a parabolic basin in the fatou set ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath43 _ positive results _ ( see  @xcite ) 0.5em",
    "let us start with rational maps of low degree that fix a fatou component containing a critical point .",
    "when the rational map is of degree @xmath0 and the basin is attracting , the map is necessarily conjugate on its julia set to a polynomial of degree @xmath0 ; on can easily see it by using a surgery procedure . in the parabolic case ,",

    "therefore , the question of local connectivity for the boundary of the basin is almost equivalent to the same question for quadratic polynomials .",
    "a rational map of degree  @xmath3 has @xmath108 critical points in @xmath109 .",
    "first assume that three of them are fixed .",
    "it is then easy to see that the rational map is conjugate ( by a moebius transformation ) to a _",
    "newton method _ associated to a polynomial of degree @xmath3 , _ i.e. _ to the rational map @xmath110 where @xmath15 is a cubic polynomial with distinct roots .",

    "the fixed fatou components are always jordan domains ( see  @xcite ) :    let @xmath112 be a cubic newton method that is a veritable rational map .",
    "then the fatou components containing a critical point are jordan domains .",
