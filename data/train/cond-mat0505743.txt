    "there are a wide variety of systems that can be modeled as an elastic lattice driven over an underlying random quenched substrate by an external force .",
    "examples include moving vortex lattices in type - ii superconductors @xcite , sliding charge density wave systems @xcite , models of atomic friction @xcite , colloidal particles moving over a rough substrate @xcite , driven wigner crystals , and stripe forming systems @xcite .",
    "typically , when the quenched disorder is strong , the elasticity of the system breaks down and topological defects proliferate in the form of dislocations and disclinations .",
    "it has also been shown that when a sufficiently large external drive is applied , the system can exhibit a dynamical reordering process where the density of topological defects is sharply reduced in the presence of a high dc drive @xcite .",
    "conversely , if the external drive is reduced from a high value where the system is ordered , the underlying disorder acts as a fluctuating force on the moving particles which increases as the drive is lowered , causing the system to dynamically melt via the proliferation of defects @xcite .",
    "this dynamical reordering effect has been demonstrated for vortices in superconductors through simulations @xcite , transport @xcite , and imaging experiments @xcite , and has also been verified for sliding charge density waves @xcite , colloids @xcite , and electron crystals @xcite .",
    "experiments have produced evidence that an applied ac drive can also induce a dynamical ordering transition in vortex systems @xcite .",
    "further , simulations with various types of ac drives have shown that the vortex lattice can reorder and that the reordered lattice is aligned in the direction of the ac drive @xcite .",
    "since these driven systems show both and ordered and disordered phases as a function of external drive , it is also possible to study the dynamics of a quench from either the ordered regime to the disordered regime or the converse .",
    "an open question is how the density of topological defects decays if the system is quenched from a regime where the steady state is disordered to a regime where it is ordered , such as by suddenly changing an external ac or dc drive .    the decay of topological defects after a quench has been studied in systems without quenched disorder through both simulations @xcite and experiments on convection and electroconvection in fluids @xcite . in general in these systems",
    ", the quench is performed between ordered and disordered phases that are separated by a continuous phase transition .",
    "a number of these studies find that the density of defects , or of grain boundaries which are comprised of defects , decays as a power law @xmath2 , where the exponent @xmath3 , @xmath4 @xcite , or @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the different exponents that are obtained depend on the model of the depth of the quench .",
    "it has also been shown that in some cases the defects form grain boundaries , and that there is a tendency for the system to create its own intrinsic pinning of the grain boundaries @xcite .",
    "this can lead to glassy effects @xcite , and in this case the defect density decays very slowly or logarithmically with time rather than as a power law .",
    "recent experiments with colloidal particles which form a triangular lattice in equilibrium showed that in a system with a large number of defects , the dislocations coarsen into grain boundaries and the defect density decays logarithmically with time rather than as a power law @xcite .",
    "simulations of two - dimensional vortex lattices driven with ac drives over quenched disorder also provided evidence that the defect density decays logarithmically with time ; however , this data was very noisy @xcite .",
    "we note that in the absence of a dc or ac drive , it has been found that a vortex lattice does not reorder into a crystal in the presence of disorder . instead , if the disorder is weak , the system is dominated by grain boundaries whose motion becomes frozen @xcite .",
    "similar behavior occurs for a small number of strong pinning sites @xcite .    here , we address how the density of topological defects decays in the presence of quenched disorder when the ac driving force is suddenly changed .",
    "such a system can be realized readily in experiment for vortices interacting with random disorder and an oscillatory applied current .",
    "simulations of quench dynamics generally employ continuum models such as the swift - hohenberg model .",
    "a complementary approach which we adopt here is to model the individual particles of the elastic lattice directly , and allow the topological defects to emerge naturally from particle rearrangements .",
    "the drawback to such an approach is that very large systems are needed to produce reasonable statistics for the defect densities .",
    "recent advances in computational speed have made it possible to access the defect density over long periods of time with particle based simulations and obtain defect numbers that are comparable with those of other simulation methods .",
    "an additional benefit of the particle based method is that processes such as effective pinning due to the ordering of the system into a triangular lattice are readily captured .",
    "we consider elastic lattices interacting with quenched disorder in two dimensions for the specific cases of vortices in thin - film type ii superconductors and charged colloids . in both cases , the equilibrium configuration of the @xmath5 repulsive overdamped particles in the absence of disorder and temperature is a defect - free triangular lattice .",

    "we note that at frequencies @xmath91 , the effect of the ac drive is negligible and the system decays as if there were no ac drive and only pinning . in this case the defect density decays logarithmically but reaches saturation at much earlier times than for the case of no pinning illustrated in fig .",

    "in summary , we have examined the coarsening of topological defects in two dimensional systems with quenched disorder when an external oscillating drive is suddenly changed from a disordered steady state value to an ordered steady state value . for quenches where the final value of the ac drive is close to the disorder - order crossover",

    "if the final value of the ac drive is much larger than the maximum pinning force , the defect density decays in a logarithmic fashion and the final state is dominated by grain boundaries .",
    "we also find that if the disorder is very weak or absent , the defect density decreases logarithmically with time .",
    "we interpret our results according to an effective shaking temperature , which is low when the ac amplitude is much larger than the pinning force or when the pinning is absent . in this case ,",
