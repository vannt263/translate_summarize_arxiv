    "heat is an omnipresent and abundant source of energy , and thus the efficient utilization of thermal energy , such as waste heat recovery and solar heat power generation , is indispensable for the realization of future sustainable society .",
    "thermoelectric generation is one of the promising technologies for making effective use of heat since it enables direct conversion from thermal energy to electrical power @xcite .",
    "as thermoelectric devices consist of solid - state materials and have no moving parts , they are silent , reliable , and scalable . most of the prevalent thermoelectric generation technologies are based on the seebeck effect , discovered by t. j. seebeck in 1821 @xcite .",
    "although a variety of thermoelectric effects were found to appear in electric conductors subjected to temperature gradients after the discovery of the seebeck effect @xcite , the earliest thermoelectric phenomenon is still the key player in the thermoelectric technology because of its relatively - high output power and versatility .",
    "the seebeck effect refers to the generation of an electric field @xmath0 as a result of a temperature gradient @xmath1 in a conductor , where the direction of @xmath0 is parallel to that of @xmath1 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : introduction](a ) ]",
    ". the thermopower induced by the seebeck effect is represented by the seebeck coefficient : @xmath2 , which is equal to the ratio of the generated electric voltage to the applied temperature difference owing to the collinear orientation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "a thermoelectric module based on the seebeck effect usually consists of a number of @xmath3-structured thermocouples , i.e. , junctions of two materials with different seebeck coefficients ; the thermocouples are serially connected to enhance the thermoelectric output [ fig .",
    "[ fig : introduction](b ) ] .",
    "the output voltage of the thermoelectric module can be enhanced in proportion to the number of the thermocouple elements , although such cascaded structure requires costly fabrication processes .",
    "the efficiency of the thermoelectric generation based on the seebeck effect is characterized by the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath4 , defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the thermal conductivity , electrical resistivity , and absolute temperature of thermoelectric materials @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath9 is known as a thermoelectric power factor .",
    "the efficiency of the seebeck device for electricity generation is defined as @xmath10  ( energy provided to a load)/(heat energy absorbed at the hot end of the device ) , which is a function of internal and load resistances .",
    "the optimized efficiency @xmath11 of the seebeck device is then given as a function of the figure of merit as follows : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the temperature difference between the hot and cold ends of the device , @xmath14 is the temperature at the hot ( cold ) end , and @xmath15 is the average temperature between the hot and cold ends @xcite .",
    "importantly , @xmath11 monotonically increases with increasing @xmath16 ; @xmath11 goes to the carnot efficiency @xmath17 in the limit of @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , many efforts in thermoelectric research are dedicated to improve the figure of merit of thermoelectric materials .    equations ( [ equ : zt - seebeck ] ) and ( [ equ : efficiency - seebeck ] ) mean that materials having a large seebeck coefficient , low thermal conductivity , and low electrical resistivity are necessary for improving the thermoelectric conversion efficiency .",
    "importantly , low @xmath6 and @xmath7 values make it possible to suppress the energy loss due to heat conduction and joule dissipation , respectively .",
    "however , in isotropic metals , the wiedemann - franz law ( @xmath19 with the electronic lorenz number @xmath20 ) limits this improvement when @xmath6 is dominated by the electronic thermal conductivity @xmath21 . a conventional way to overcome",
    "this limitation is to use thermoelectric semiconductors , where the thermal conductance is usually dominated by phonons while the electrical conductance is determined by charge carriers , and thus @xmath6 and @xmath7 are separated according to the kind of the carriers @xcite .",
    "recently , to improve the figure of merit of thermoelectric materials by reducing phonon thermal conductivity without affecting electrical conductivity , not only exploration of new materials @xcite but also nanotechnology - based phonon engineering @xcite have been conducted .",
    "furthermore , research on the thermoelectric properties of anisotropic materials has attracted increasing attention recently @xcite ; since the wiedemann - franz law is violated in anisotropic materials , they are also useful for optimizing heat and charge conductions separately .",
    "nearly 200 years after the discovery of the seebeck effect , a novel thermoelectric generation principle was discovered in the field of spintronics @xcite .",
    "this novel principle can be said as a spin counterpart of the seebeck effect : `` spin seebeck effect '' ( sse ) @xcite .",
    "the sse refers to the generation of a spin current , a flow of spin angular momentum @xcite , as a result of a temperature gradient in a magnetic material .",
    "the sse is applicable to the construction of thermoelectric generators because the spin current generated by the sse can be converted into a charge current via the spin - orbit interaction , or the inverse spin hall effect ( ishe ) @xcite , in a conductive thin film ( mostly , a paramagnetic metal film ) adjacent to the magnetic material ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] for details ) . here",
    ", the direction of the electric field induced by the ishe @xmath22 in the conductive film is perpendicular to that of @xmath1 in the magnetic material [ fig .",
    "[ fig : introduction](c ) ] , a configuration different from the conventional seebeck effect .",
    "since the sse appears not only in ferromagnetic metals @xcite and semiconductors @xcite but also in magnetic ( mostly , ferrimagnetic ) insulators @xcite , it enables the conversion of heat energy in insulators into electrical energy in adjacent conductors @xcite , which was impossible if only conventional thermoelectric technologies were used . the thermoelectric technology based on",
    "the sse is still in an early phase of its development , and the efficiency is very small at the present stage .",
    "however , as reviewed in this article , the sse exhibits various unconventional features suitable for thermoelectric applications .        in this review ,",
    "we focus on the so - called longitudinal sse ( lsse ) @xcite in metallic film / magnetic insulator junction systems , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : introduction](c ) . after the first report on the sse @xcite",
    ", this phenomenon has been measured mainly in two different device structures , i.e. , the longitudinal and transverse configurations @xcite , where spin currents parallel and perpendicular to @xmath1 are measured , respectively . the longitudinal configuration has been used in most of the recent sse studies because the insulator - based lsse systems are useful for the exclusive detection of spin - current - induced signals and suitable for thermoelectric applications owing to its simple and versatile structure .",
    "the first observation of the lsse was reported in 2010 by using a junction system comprising a paramagnetic metal pt and a ferrimagnetic insulator y@xmath23fe@xmath24o@xmath25 ( yig ) @xcite .",
    "the pt / yig junction system is now recognized as a model system for studying sse physics , since pt and yig enable efficient spin - charge conversion and pure detection of spin - current effects , respectively . since this demonstration , the lsse has been observed in various combinations of magnetic insulators and conductive films @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lssematerials ] .",
    "in contrast , in the transverse configuration , the sse measurements may be disturbed by thermal conductivity mismatch @xcite between a film and a substrate that induces parasitic lsse @xcite or anomalous nernst effect ( ane ) @xcite , requiring careful thermal design of the sample and measurement systems . in the transverse sse measurements using conductive ferromagnets , a planar nernst effect ( pne ) @xcite may also arise . in the past several years",
    ", various thermoelectric measurements have been performed in the transverse configuration @xcite , and the quantitative separation of the transverse sse from the parasitic ane and pne has been reported in a ferromagnetic metal @xcite .",
    "in addition to the longitudinal and transverse configurations , a non - local geometry has also been used recently to investigate the length scale of the sse @xcite .",
    "the lsse in insulators allows a new approach to improve the thermoelectric figure of merit . in the insulator - based lsse device ,",
    "the heat and charge currents flow in different parts of the device : @xmath6 is the thermal conductivity of the magnetic insulator and @xmath7 is the electrical resistivity of the adjacent metal , such that @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the lsse device are segregated according to the part of the device elements @xcite .",
    "therefore , the denominator of the figure of merit , @xmath26 , of the lsse device is free from the wiedemann - franz law , and allowed to be optimized if one selects the combination of a magnetic insulator with low thermal conductivity and a metallic film with low electrical resistivity .",
    "this is one of the unique characteristics of the lsse device , although , in addition to the @xmath26 factor , the lsse thermopower itself must be improved .",
    "importantly , in fact , the relation between the figure of merit and the thermoelectric conversion efficiency of the lsse device should be different from that of the conventional seebeck device due to the different device configurations and driving principles @xcite .",
    "one of the purposes of this review article is to formulate the thermoelectric figure of merit and conversion efficiency of the lsse device , and to clarify the upper limit of the efficiency .",
    "the advantages of the lsse device include not only the device - design flexibility , discussed above , but also the following characteristics .",
    "the lsse device has convenient scaling capability , where the thermoelectric output increases simply by extending the device area because the total amount of the thermally generated spin currents increases as the device becomes larger @xcite . here ,",
    "the electric field induced by the ishe at each point of the lsse device is integrated into the output lsse voltage : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the magnitude of @xmath22 and @xmath29 is the length of the metallic layer along the @xmath30 direction [ fig . [",
    "fig : introduction](c ) ] .",
    "since the internal resistance of the metallic layer of the lsse device is @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively being the length along the @xmath34 direction and thickness of the metallic film , the maximum extractable electrical power @xmath35 is proportional to the area of the lsse device : @xmath36 [ see sec .",

    "[ see sec .",
    "[ sec : multilayer ] ] .",
    "in addition to this approach , the improvement of the spin mixing conductance [ the factor ( 2 ) ] and the spin hall angle [ the factor ( 3 ) ] are also essential .",
    "for example , to realize the efficient spin - angular - momentum transfer across the metal / insulator interface , the improvement of crystal quality and interface condition of the lsse device by annealing has been conducted @xcite .",
    "the spin mixing conductance can also be enhanced by inserting an ultra - thin ferromagnetic interlayer between a paramagnetic metal and a ferrimagnetic insulator owing to the increase of magnetic moment density at the interface @xcite .",
    "to realize the efficient spin - charge conversion , the ishe has been measured in various metals @xcite , alloys @xcite , semiconductors @xcite , oxides @xcite , and organic materials @xcite .",
    "the spin mixing conductance and spin hall angle can be estimated by means of various techniques , such as micro - wave - induced spin pumping @xcite , spin hall magnetoresistance @xcite , and non - local methods @xcite , where these phenomena can be measured by applying microwaves or charge currents to similar paramagnet / ferromagnet junction systems instead of temperature gradients . therefore , not only the lsse experiments but also these techniques are necessary for optimizing the lsse devices . although the conventional lsse experiments have mainly been performed using paramagnetic metal / ferrimagnetic insulator junction systems , all - ferromagnetic devices @xcite ,",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to the conclusions and prospects .",
    "figure [ fig : lsse - ishe - setup](a ) shows a schematic illustration of the standard configuration used for the lsse measurements .",
    "the basic structure of the lsse device consists of a metallic film formed on a magnetic insulator . here , the magnetic insulator is a slab without a substrate or a film formed on a substrate , while the metallic layer must be a thin film as explained later . in the metal / insulator junction in the longitudinal configuration ,",
    "the temperature gradient , @xmath1 , is applied perpendicular to the metal / insulator interface ( along the @xmath37 direction ) and the spatial direction of the spin current induced by the lsse is parallel to the @xmath1 direction @xcite .",
    "the lsse is usually measured with applying an external magnetic field to align the magnetization of the magnetic insulator along the @xmath34 direction [ fig .",
    "[ fig : lsse - ishe - setup](a ) ] .",

    "is applied across the metal / insulator interface by sandwiching the lsse device between two heat baths with different temperatures .",

    "to apply the temperature gradient in the direction perpendicular to the metal / insulator interface , the lsse device is usually sandwiched between two heat baths which are stabilized at different temperatures [ fig .",
    "[ fig : lsse - ishe - setup](a ) ] @xcite . by heating or cooling the heat baths",
    ", one can apply a reversible temperature gradient to the lsse device since its top and bottom surfaces are directly connected to the heat bath @xcite . owing to this high temperature controllability , the setup depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsse - ishe - setup](a ) is mostly used in the lsse measurements ; all the experiments shown in this article were performed in this setup . in contrast , the temperature gradient can be applied to the lsse device also by using joule heating in an on - chip heater @xcite , laser heating @xcite , and microwave heating @xcite .",
    "although these methods enable the measurements of the lsse without using the specialized temperature - gradient generators , it is difficult to determine the temperature distributions ; the methods are sometimes combined with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the thermoelectric generation mechanism of the lsse device is summarized as follows .",
    "the driving force of the lsse is nonequilibrium dynamics of magnons , collective excitations of localized magnetic moments , in the magnetic insulator driven by the temperature gradient @xcite , since the lsse appears even when a conduction electrons contribution is completely frozen out .",
    "this nonequilibrium magnon dynamics in the magnetic insulator can interact with conduction - electron spins in the attached metal and transfer the spin angular momentum across at the metal / insulator interface via the interface s - d exchange interaction , which is described in terms of the spin mixing conductance @xcite .",
    "this spin - angular - momentum transfer induces a conduction - electron spin current in the metallic film .",
    "this spin current is converted into the electric field , @xmath22 , by the aforementioned ishe in the metallic layer if the spin - orbit interaction of the metal is strong [ fig .",
    "[ fig : lsse - ishe - setup](b ) ] .",
    "when the magnetization @xmath43 of the magnetic insulator is aligned along the @xmath34 direction , @xmath22 is generated in the metallic film along the @xmath30 direction according to the relation @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath41 , and @xmath46 are the spin hall angle , unit vector along the electron - spin polarization ( @xmath42 ) in the metallic layer , and spatial direction of the spin current ( with the magnitude of spin current density @xmath47 ) induced by the lsse , respectively .",
    "thus , the thermoelectric voltage can be generated by the combination of the lsse and ishe and observed by measuring the voltage @xmath38 between the ends of the metallic layer , where the sign of @xmath38 is determined by that of @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lssematerials ] ) @xcite .",
    "this thermoelectric generation mechanism works below the curie temperature of the magnetic insulator @xcite . here , to detect the lsse voltage",
    ", the thickness of the metallic layer has to be comparable to its spin diffusion length @xcite , typically a few to several hundreds of nanometers , since the spin current injected into the metallic layer and the resultant @xmath22 exist only in the vicinity of the metal / insulator interface due to the spin relaxation .",
    "we also note that , when a highly resistive insulator is used , the contribution from thermoelectric phenomena in itinerant magnets , such as the conventional seebeck and nernst effects , is eliminated in the lsse device @xcite .",
    "in this section , by using the pt / yig model systems , we demonstrate the basic characteristics of the lsse devices , such as the dependence of the thermoelectric voltage on the temperature , temperature gradient and its direction , magnetic field and its direction , and device geometry .          here",
    ", we show the fundamental properties of the lsse @xcite .",
    "the pt / yig junction system used here consists of a single - crystalline yig slab and a pt film sputtered on the well - polished surface of the yig .",

    "[ fig : fundamental_data1](c ) ] .",
    "the @xmath38 signal was observed to vary with @xmath56 in a sinusoidal pattern and vanish when @xmath63 and @xmath64 , a situation consistent with the symmetry of the ishe induced by the lsse described in eq .",
    "( [ equ : ishe ] ) .",
    "the above experiments indicate that the observed thermoelectric voltage is attributed to the lsse .",
    "however , to exclusively establish the lsse , the contribution of the lsse has to be separated from that of the ane @xcite .",
    "since pt is a paramagnetic metal and yig is a very good insulator , the ane does not exist in the pt / yig system in the ordinary sense . in this system",
    ", however , weak ferromagnetism may be induced in the pt layer in the vicinity of the pt / yig interface due to a static magnetic proximity effect @xcite because pt is near the stoner ferromagnetic instability @xcite .",
    "in fact , when the thickness of pt is very thin ( @xmath65 ) , weak ferromagnetic signals were observed by means of x - ray magnetic circular dichroism @xcite .",
    "if the proximity - induced ferromagnetism induces the ane in the pt layer , the ishe voltage induced by the lsse in the pt / yig system may be contaminated by the proximity - induced ane in the pt layer .",
    "this possibility was pointed out by huang _",
    "et al . _ in 2012 on the basis of magnetoresistance and hall measurements @xcite , although the anisotropic magnetoresistance in pt / yig systems was subsequently shown to be attributed to the spin hall magnetoresistance @xcite . here",

    "this suppression of the lsse voltage becomes apparent by applying high magnetic fields , while it is very small in the conventional lsse measurements in a low field range .",

    "the field - induced suppression of the lsse for @xmath89 can not be explained by the conventional sse models , while that for @xmath90 seemingly agrees with numerical calculations based on the thermal spin pumping mechanism [ fig .",
    "[ fig : high - field1](c ) ] ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the inconsistency between the observed suppression of the lsse voltage and the conventional formulation at relatively - high temperatures is attributed to the fact that the small zeeman energy is defeated by thermal fluctuations when @xmath91 in the conventional models , where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 are the @xmath92-factor , bohr magneton , and boltzmann constant , respectively ( note that the magnon gap energy at @xmath86 corresponds to @xmath95 ) ; to affect the magnon excitation by magnetic fields , the magnon energy has to be comparable to or less than the zeeman energy . in contrast , the observed large suppression of the lsse voltage in the pt / yig - slab sample indicates that the magnon excitation relevant to the lsse is affected by magnetic fields even at around room temperature .",
    "this result suggests that low - frequency magnons of which the energy is comparable to the zeeman energy provide a dominant contribution to the lsse ; the thermo - spin conversion efficiency of the lsse has magnon - frequency dependence , which is not included in the conventional sse theories . in @xcite and @xcite , the origin of this spectral non - uniform thermo - spin conversion is discussed in terms of the frequency dependence of a magnon thermalization ( energy relaxation ) length and a magnon diffusion length , respectively .",

    "in fact , several research groups demonstrated that , by using the pt / yig - slab and pt / yig - film systems , the magnitude of the lsse thermopower monotonically decreases with decreasing the thickness of yig [ our experimental results are shown in figs .",

    ". such columnar structure can be suitable for the flexible lsse devices because of the following two reasons .",
    "first , in the lsse configuration , the spin current is generated along the columnar structure , and thus less affected by grain scattering .",
    "second , the columnar grain boundary can work as a stress - relieving cushion when the film is bent , leading to the high flexibility and bending tolerance .",
    "the ferrite plating method potentially enables the direct coating of thermoelectric functions onto various surfaces over a large area , expanding the versatility and utility of the lsse devices .",
    "significantly , the flexible thermoelectric sheet based on the lsse , demonstrated here , has remarkably low thermal resistance because of the thick - substrate - free structure .",
    "therefore , it may be suitable for heat - flow sensing applications @xcite .          as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lssematerials ] , most of the lsse experiments to date have been performed by using pt as a metallic layer .",

    "we found that the ni / bi : yig - film sample exhibits the clear @xmath38 signal of which the magnitude is more than twice greater than that of the ane voltage in a plain ni film directly placed on the substrate , indicating that the signal in the ni / bi : yig - film sample is attributed to the superposition of the ane in the ni layer and the ishe induced by the spin current injected from the bi : yig layer .",

    "the recent studies have revealed that the lsse voltage in [ p / f ] @xmath271 @xmath274 systems significantly and monotonically increases with increasing the number of the p / f bilayers @xmath274 .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the magnitude of the lsse voltage in [ pt / fe@xmath23o@xmath270 @xmath271 6 systems was observed to be enhanced by a factor of 46 compared with that in [ pt / fe@xmath23o@xmath270 @xmath271 1 bilayer systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig : multilayer - exp ] ) .",
    "since this lsse - voltage enhancement is unaccompanied by the increase of the internal resistance , the output power also increases with increasing @xmath274 , a situation different from the case of the lsse - voltage enhancement by the spin hall thermopile @xcite .",
    "the observed @xmath274 dependence of the lsse voltage in the [ p / f ] @xmath273 multilayer systems is beyond conventional expectations based on the situation that the systems are merely regarded as several independent p / f bilayers electrically connected in parallel , where the output _",
    "voltage _ is not enhanced while the output _",
    "power _ is enhanced owing to the reduction of the internal resistance [ fig .",
    "[ fig : multilayer1](a ) ] @xcite .",
    "importantly , this lsse - voltage enhancement can not be explained even when the spin - current injection into p from both the top and bottom f layers is taken into account , where the upper limit of the lsse enhancement is twice of the voltage in the single p / f bilayer ; as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : multilayer - exp](b ) , the observed enhancement is much greater than this upper limit .",
    "our current interpretation of the mechanism of the lsse enhancement in the p / f multilayer systems is summarized as follows @xcite .",
    "the essence of the lsse enhancement is the boundary conditions for spin currents flowing normal to the p / f interfaces , which affect the magnitude and spatial profile of the spin currents generated by the lsse .",
    "here we assume the following two boundary conditions : ( i ) spin currents must disappear at the top and bottom surfaces of the multilayer systems and ( ii ) spin currents in the p and f layers are continuous at the interfaces .",
    "although spin currents in paramagnetic metals and ferrimagnetic insulators are respectively carried by conduction electrons and spin waves , the boundary condition ( ii ) allows us to treat these spin currents in the same manner in the following phenomenological discussions .",
    "let us now compare a spin - current profile in a p@xmath275/f@xmath275/p@xmath101/f@xmath101 system with that in a f@xmath275/p@xmath101/f@xmath101 system without the top p layer ( p@xmath275 ) [ fig .",
    "[ fig : multilayer1](b ) ] , where p@xmath276 and p@xmath277 are good spin sinks . according to the boundary condition ( i ) ,",
    "the spin current is eliminated at the top of the f@xmath275 layer in the f@xmath275/p@xmath101/f@xmath101 system . however ,",
    "this is not the case for the p@xmath275/f@xmath275/p@xmath101/f@xmath101 system ; the spin current remains a large value at the p@xmath275/f@xmath275 interface , while it must disappear at the top of the p@xmath275 layer .",
    "as shown in fig . [ fig : multilayer1](b ) , this difference results in the enhancement of the spin currents near the p@xmath275/f@xmath275 interface , a situation consistent with the prediction in @xcite . by applying the above discussion , we calculated out - of - plane spin - current profiles in the [ p / f ] @xmath271 @xmath274 systems for various values of @xmath274 [ fig . [",
    "fig : multilayer1](c ) ] and the @xmath274 dependence of the spin - current magnitude averaged over all the p layers @xmath278 [ the inset to fig . [",
    "fig : multilayer1](c ) ] ( note that @xmath278 can be regarded as an observable quantity in the measurements of the lsse in the p / f multilayer systems , since the p layers are electrically connected with each other due to the small thickness and resultant small out - of - plane electrical resistance of the f layers @xcite ) .",
    "importantly , the magnitude of @xmath278 monotonically increases with increasing @xmath274 .",
    "the physics behind is that , thanks to the multilayer structure , the spin current in the p interlayers acquires a new length scale and boundary value .",
    "this phenomenological interpretation is consistent with the experimental results ; similar @xmath274 dependence of the lsse voltage was observed in the [ pt / fe@xmath23o@xmath270 @xmath271 @xmath274 systems [ compare the inset to fig .",

    "[ fig : trend ] ) .",
    "since the enhancement of the lsse based on this mechanism strongly depends on the spin diffusion length ( magnon diffusion length ) of the p ( f ) layer , the determination of optimum thicknesses of each layer and optimum p / f material combination is crucial for further improvement of the thermoelectric performance of the lsse devices .",
    "in this article , we reviewed the experimental results of the lsse in insulator - based systems from the viewpoint of thermoelectric applications .",
    "the basic structure of the lsse device is a simple bilayer film comprising a magnetic insulator and a metallic or other conductive material ; an out - of - plane temperature gradient in the magnetic insulator layer induces an in - plane electric field in the metallic layer via spin - current generation across the interface . owing to this configuration , the lsse device exhibits the following unique characteristics .",
    "firstly , the figure of merit of the lsse device is free from the wiedemann - franz law , and can be optimized by selecting the combination of a magnetic insulator with low thermal conductivity and a metallic film with low electrical resistivity .",
    "secondly , the lsse device follows the convenient scaling law ; the maximum extractable power of the lsse device is proportional to the device area , and can be enhanced simply enlarging the device without constructing complicated modules .",
    "the simple structure and scaling law of the lsse device make it possible to implement thermoelectric functions onto various heat sources by using versatile and low - cost fabrication processes .",
    "the thermoelectric performance of the lsse device can not be simply compared with that of conventional thermoelectric devices based on the seebeck effect because of the different device configurations and driving principles .",
    "the theory presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : calc - efficiency ] shows that the thermoelectric conversion efficiency of the lsse device is characterized by the figure of merit @xmath279 , described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : z_s01 ] ) . here , @xmath279 is defined as proportional to the square of the lsse thermopower and inversely proportional to the thermal conductivity of a magnetic insulator and electrical resistivity of a metallic film , which is similar to the case of the conventional thermoelectric devices .",
    "however , the figure of merit of the lsse device is defined in the range of @xmath280 , which is a characteristic of transverse thermoelectric devices .    despite the potential advantages of the lsse device , the current stage of the sse research is still far from realistic thermoelectric applications",
    "this is mainly because the lsse thermopower is very small at present , although there is plenty of scope for the performance improvement .",
    "the lsse thermopower can be enhanced by improving the thermal spin - current generation efficiency in the magnetic insulator , spin hall angle in the metallic layer , and spin mixing conductance at the metal / insulator interface .",
    "in fact , owing to the efforts after the discovery of the lsse , the thermoelectric performance of the lsse device is being improved , especially , in recent years with the advent of multilayer systems as shown in the time - series trends of the lsse thermopower @xmath85 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : trend](a ) ] and the lsse power factor [ fig .",
    "[ fig : trend](b ) ] in typical lsse devices . here",
    ", we define the lsse power factor as the output power normalized by the applied temperature gradient and by the device area : @xmath281 where @xmath282 ( @xmath283 ) is the sheet resistance of the metallic layer of the lsse device and we assume @xmath284 .",
    "figure [ fig : trend](b ) emphasizes again that multilayer systems are useful for improving the output power of the lsse device due to the combination of the voltage enhancement and internal resistance reduction .",
    "nevertheless , since even the current record of the thermoelectric performance of the lsse is still inadequate , continuous development of the lsse - based thermoelectric technology is necessary . for realistic thermoelectric applications , the reduction of the thermal conductivity ( electrical resistivity ) of the insulator layer ( metallic layer ) for the improvement of @xmath279 and optimum thermal design for the stable and continuous operation of the lsse device are also indispensable .    in the field of spintronics , in addition to the sse",
    ", a variety of novel phenomena in which the interplay of spin and heat plays a crucial role were discovered @xcite .",
    "some of the thermo - spin phenomena , such as spin - dependent seebeck effects @xcite , seebeck effects in magnetic tunnel junctions @xcite , and magnon - drag effects @xcite , are also potentially applicable to thermoelectric generation in nano - structured spintronics devices . furthermore , at low temperatures",

    "although the origin of this giant thermoelectric effect is different from the sse discussed in this article , it represents a great potential of spin - based thermoelectric technologies .",

    "<S> the spin seebeck effect ( sse ) refers to the generation of a spin current as a result of a temperature gradient in magnetic materials including insulators . </S>",
    "<S> the sse is applicable to thermoelectric generation because the thermally generated spin current can be converted into a charge current via spin - orbit interaction in conductive materials adjacent to the magnets . </S>",
    "<S> the insulator - based sse device exhibits unconventional characteristics potentially useful for thermoelectric applications , such as simple structure , device - design flexibility , and convenient scaling capability . in this article , we review recent studies on the sse from the viewpoint of thermoelectric applications . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we introduce the thermoelectric generation process and measurement configuration of the sse , followed by showing fundamental characteristics of the sse device . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , a theory of the thermoelectric conversion efficiency of the sse device is presented , which clarifies the difference between the sse and conventional thermoelectric effects and the efficiency limit of the sse device . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show preliminary demonstrations of the sse in various device structures for future thermoelectric applications and discuss prospects of the sse - based thermoelectric technologies .    </S>",
