    "<S> by solving the three - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation we generate two - dimensional axially - symmetric and anisotropic dipolar bose - einstein condensate bright solitons , for repulsive atomic interaction , stabilized by only a weak one - dimensional optical lattice ( ol ) aligned along and perpendicular , respectively , to the dipole polarization direction . in the former case vortex solitons </S>",
    "<S> can also be created . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is possible to make a stable array of small interacting axially - symmetric dipolar solitons put on alternate ol sites . </S>",
    "<S> further , we demonstrate the elastic nature of the collision of two such solitons .    a bright soliton is a self - reinforcing solitary wave that maintains its shape , while traveling at constant speed , due to a cancellation of nonlinear attraction and dispersive effects . </S>",
    "<S> integrable solitons without any external trap or intervention for cubic nonlinearity exist only in one dimension ( 1d ) . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , bright matter - wave solitons and soliton trains were created in a quasi-1d bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath0li @xcite and @xmath1rb atoms @xcite by turning the atomic interaction attractive from repulsive using a feshbach resonance ( fr ) @xcite and employing a transverse trap .    </S>",
    "<S> although , the normal three - dimensional ( 3d ) bec soliton @xcite is of great interest , such a bec has only short - range attraction which makes it vulnerable against collapse . </S>",
    "<S> physical systems are stable due to a peculiar nature of interaction among its constituents ( atoms , molecules and nuclei ) , e.g. , short - range repulsion and long - range attraction . lately , bec of @xmath2cr @xcite and @xmath3dy @xcite atoms with a large long - range dipolar interaction has been observed . </S>",
    "<S> also , experimental tuning of the long - range dipolar interaction by means of rapidly rotating orienting fields @xcite as well as of the short - range atomic interaction using a fr @xcite are completely under control . </S>",
    "<S> this engineering of the atomic and dipolar interactions makes the dipolar bec ( dbec ) an interesting system for the formation of soliton @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the long - range anisotropic dipolar interaction is attractive in some directions and repulsive in others . </S>",
    "<S> if it were attractive in all directions , stable robust 3d dbec solitons , corresponding to a minimum in energy functional , would naturally be formed for repulsive short - range atomic and attractive long - range dipolar interactions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> normal dipolar interaction leads to attraction along the polarization @xmath4 direction and repulsion along transverse directions . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to have the opposite by tuning the dipole interaction to  negative \" values by orienting fields @xcite and this set - up was used in some studies @xcite . for normal dipolar interaction , </S>",
    "<S> an anisotropic two - dimensional ( 2d ) soliton can be obtained for repulsive short - range atomic interaction if a weak ol is placed along @xmath5 axis , perpendicular to the polarization direction @xmath4 , to overcome the dipolar repulsion in transverse directions . for dipolar interaction </S>",
    "<S> tuned to negative values @xcite , axially - symmetric 2d bright and vortex solitons can be obtained for repulsive short - range atomic interaction if a weak ol is placed along @xmath4 axis to overcome the dipolar repulsion in that direction in this sign - changed setting . in all cases , the dipolar repulsion is weak and we do not need any trap in other directions to stabilize a soliton . </S>",
    "<S> such 2d solitons can not be stabilized without the dipolar interaction @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we present a linear stability analysis for the axially - symmetric soliton @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we study the 2d dbec solitons using the numerical and lagrangian variational analysis of the 3d gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation . </S>",
    "<S> the effective lagrangian of the variational analysis has the same structure as that of a generalized classical dynamical system with two degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> we find that stable ( referred to as  center \" as it corresponds to a stable periodic orbit around a center in phase space ) and unstable stationary ( called  saddle \" as it corresponds to a saddle point in energy ) states appear and disappear through the mechanism of _ saddle - center bifurcation _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there have been studies of 2d dbec solitons with strong harmonic traps along @xmath5 @xcite or @xmath4 @xcite axis and of 1d dbec solitons under transverse harmonic trap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present solitons confined by only a weak ol along @xmath5 or @xmath4 axis , respectively , are distinct . </S>",
    "<S> the previous studies @xcite will essentially have an approximate gaussian density distribution along the infinite trap direction , whereas the present solitons will have an exponential density distribution due to weak finite traps in these directions . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , an ol simulates the periodic electron - atom potential in a solid and the study of solitons in an ol is also of interest in condensed - matter physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a new type of stable interacting 1d array of solitons can be formed in 3d space when tiny axially - symmetric interacting dbec bright solitons are placed on alternate sites of the ol . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the solitons are placed on all sites of the ol , the array is destroyed due to strong long - range dipolar interaction among its constituents . statics and dynamics of such periodic array of tiny droplets of dipolar matter </S>",
    "<S> are of concern in condensed matter physics @xcite , as they simulate many problems of general interest , such as , a periodic linear array of tiny magnets . </S>",

    "<S> ol , gap solitons having negative effective mass responsible for attraction , with the chemical potential lying in the band - gap , can be made @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> if two equal 2d solitons , as in figure [ fig4 ] ( c ) , coalesce at low velocities , the nonlinearities of the merged soliton molecule will be outside the domain of stability in figure [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the formation of soliton molecule is mostly not possible in the present case . at large velocities the solitons of @xcite </S>",
    "<S> undergo quasi - elastic collision quite similar to the present collision shown in figure [ fig4 ] ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> also , both quasi - elastic collision at large velocities and merging at low velocities of two quasi-1d solitons under transverse harmonic confinement was illustrated in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , we studied different types of 2d bright solitons in a dbec with repulsive atomic interaction using the solution of the 3d gp equation . </S>",
    "<S> anisotropic stable 2d bright solitons in dbec are possible on a weak 1d ol perpendicular to the polarization direction . </S>",
    "<S> axially - symmetric stable 2d bright and vortex solitons in dbec can be generated on a weak 1d ol along the polarization direction when the dipolar interaction is tuned to negative values @xcite . in this sign - changed dipolar - interaction configuration , bright and vortex </S>",
    "<S> solitons are stable due to the long - range attractive dipolar interaction in the quasi-2d shape . in the axially - symmetric case </S>",
    "<S> , an 1d stable array of tiny solitons , placed on alternate ol sites , can be made . </S>",
    "<S> such 1d array with empty ol sites between solitons is of interest in condensed matter physics @xcite and bears some similarity with stable checkerboard pattern of dbec on 2d ol with empty sites in between @xcite , both arising due to dipolar interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the elastic nature of collision of two axially - symmetric solitons is also demonstrated . with present technology these stable 2d solitons and their 1d arrays </S>",
    "<S> can be created and studied in laboratory .    </S>",
