    "the problem of finding the densest configurations of identical hard spheres inside a cylinder is related to many different aspects in science and engineering : similar densest structures ( e.g. zigzags and helices ) have in recent years been observed for the self - assembly of nano - spheres inside carbon nanotubes @xcite , charged particles on cylindrical surfaces @xcite , micro - spheres inside micro - channels @xcite and colloidal particles inside cylindrical channels @xcite , and also for the formation of colloidal crystal wires @xcite , the reason being that in all such cases the particles close - pack themselves like hard spheres .",
    "relevant problems of interest include ( i ) finding a theoretical derivation of the corresponding densest packings of hard spheres and ( ii ) finding a general methodology for constructing them in practice .",
    "for this problem , a wide range of chiral and achiral densest structures for a diameter ratio of @xmath1 cylinder diameter / sphere diameter @xmath2 $ ] have previously been found by simulated annealing @xcite and by other computational means @xcite , where @xmath3 is a critical value of @xmath4 below which the densest configurations are entirely made up of cylinder - touching spheres . in particular ,",
    "the densest structures for @xmath5 $ ] , which have their entire structural information contained on the cylinder surface , can be described by a phyllotactic scheme @xcite that is relevant to the study of plant morphology .",

    "[ phyllo_d_leq_2 ] for @xmath14 $ ] , the first four phases constructed from such a deposition procedure are in complete agreement with the planar zigzag , single helix , double helix and achiral doublets predicted from simulated annealing @xcite .",
    "the findings show that all these densest packings can be derived theoretically by means of maximizing the abovementioned number density of spheres , and establish sequential deposition as a possible methodology for constructing such densest packings with the aforementioned physical systems .     against the arc length @xmath15 for spheres in contact at various values of the diameter ratio @xmath4 .",

    ", width=251,height=188 ]    this 3-d problem of packing identical spheres onto the inner surface of a cylinder is equivalent to a problem of packing objects in 2-d space , and is related to the 2-d problem of packing circular discs : in cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath22 with a radial position @xmath23 and an arc length @xmath24 , where the length quantities @xmath25 , @xmath9 and @xmath12 are all expressed in units of the sphere diameter , the equation for two such spheres in contact is given by @xmath26 which involves only two position variables ( i.e. the differences in @xmath9 and @xmath27 between the two spheres in contact ) , corresponding to a 2-d problem , and can be derived easily using trigonometric identities .",
    "this implies the following ( fig .",
    "[ contact_eq ] ) : ( i ) for @xmath16 , the cylinder s surface is so curved that no two spheres can be accommodated on the same @xmath9 position , i.e no solution exists for @xmath18 .",
    "( ii ) as @xmath28 , the cylindrical surface becomes flat and the equation for spheres in contact approaches that for the 2-d packing of circular discs ; in the densest configuration , the sphere centres form a perfect triangular lattice on the phyllotactic plot @xcite of @xmath9 against @xmath12 such that every sphere is in contact with 6 other spheres .",
    "( iii ) for any finite value of @xmath4 , the problem of finding an analytic solution to the densest configuration is complicated by the requirement of a periodicity @xmath29 along the @xmath12 axis @xcite and by the relatively complex mathematical form of eq .",
    "( [ eq_1 ] ) . finding an analytic solution for cases of finite @xmath4 thus remains a challenging theoretical problem .    to gain insights into such an analytic solution ,",
    "a semi - analytic approach is adopted here , based on the following conjecture : for any given value of @xmath4 , if the packing of spheres is locally densest everywhere in the columnar structure , the overall structure would be at its globally densest configuration . for a sufficiently long column of spheres ,",
    "let @xmath30 be the average number density of spheres ( number of spheres per unit length ) along @xmath9 , where @xmath31 are the indices of the spheres in ascending order of their @xmath9 positions .",
    "this number density is related to the volume fraction , @xmath32 volume of spheres / volume of cylinder , as follows : @xmath33 thus the densest columnar structure , which by definition has the greatest volume fraction , also corresponds to the densest packing of spheres along @xmath9 .",
    "it follows , from the abovementioned conjecture , that the densest columnar structure can be constructed from a sequential deposition of individual spheres onto the lowest possible @xmath9 positions ( determined across the entire @xmath34 range of @xmath27 ) at which they would come into contact with one or more other spheres .",
    "this is because such an iterative process would ensure the packing of spheres along @xmath9 to be densest possible at every @xmath9 location .",
    "a template comprised of spheres , which covers the entire @xmath34 range of @xmath27 , is needed as a base for the initial deposition of spheres . for @xmath35 $ ] ,",
    "( [ eq_1 ] ) for spheres in contact is valid for any value of @xmath36 so that , among other possible choices of a multi - sphere template , a single sphere is already enough to make up such a template .",
    "for @xmath37 , however , this equation is valid only for a limited range of @xmath36 , which satisfies the condition @xmath38 $ ] , so that a template comprised of more than one sphere is necessary . in general , for any given value of @xmath4 , the columnar structures of spheres generated from the abovementioned deposition procedure depend on their underlying templates , and the densest structure can be obtained by varying across a diversity of templates .     against the diameter ratio @xmath4 , showing a complete overlap of data points between this deposition algorithm and simulated annealing ( data supplied by mughal @xcite ) .",
    "the inset shows that the differences in @xmath39 between the two algorithms are of the order of @xmath40 , i.e. less than 1% of percentage differences , and thus comparable to the numerical uncertainties in the simulations .",
    "the occasional peaks in @xmath41 are due to the relatively larger numerical uncertainties in the proximity of a structural transition .",

    "( [ eq_1 ] ) .",
    "if such a solution does not exist , the value of @xmath46 is assigned separately . along the same deposition direction of increasing or decreasing @xmath27 , which determines the chirality of a chiral structure ,",
    "additional spheres are deposited if the existing template as made up of these two initially filled spheres does not cover the @xmath34 range of @xmath27 .",
    "inspired by the relevant triangular - lattice - like phyllotactic patterns @xcite , the positions of such additional spheres are chosen in the spirit to maintain a continuity in the relative positions @xmath47 and @xmath48 of successively filled spheres : for @xmath49 , the angular position of the @xmath50 sphere is set to be @xmath51 , and the sphere is deposited in a @xmath9 position at which it comes into contact with one or more other spheres . if such a @xmath9 position does not exist ,",
    "the sphere is placed at @xmath52 .",
    "deposition of such additional spheres stops whenever the template created has covered the @xmath34 range of @xmath27 .",
    "the iterative process of sequential deposition of spheres then starts from the angular position of the last deposited sphere in the process of template creation : in each iterative step , a sphere is deposited onto the lowest possible @xmath9 position at which it would come into contact with one or more other spheres .",
    "starting from the angular position of the previously filled sphere , this lowest @xmath9 position is determined via a @xmath34 scan along the same deposition direction of increasing or decreasing @xmath27 as that for the process of template creation .",
    "should there be degeneracy where this lowest @xmath9 position occurs at more than one angular position , the first such angular position encountered in the @xmath34 scan is chosen .",
    "after a sufficiently long ( e.g. 10 times of the sphere diameter ) column of spheres has been generated , the average number density @xmath30 is evaluated via a linear fit of @xmath31 against @xmath9 , and the volume fraction is computed using eq .",
