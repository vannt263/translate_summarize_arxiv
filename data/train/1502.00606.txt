    "we reduce by translations by going to the center - of - mass - zero space which is a 3-dimensional subspace @xmath72 having jacobi coordinates as hermitian orthonormal coordinates :    @xmath73    as is well - known , if we start tangent to the center - of - mass - zero subspace @xmath74 we stay tangent to it .",
