    "the figure shows that , depending on the rotation rate , three different regimes can be identified .",
    "regime i ( weak rotation ) , where no heat transport enhancement is observed , regime ii ( moderate rotation ) , where a strong heat transport enhancement is found , and regime iii ( strong rotation ) , where the heat transport starts to decrease .",

    "flow visualization experiments  @xcite and the analysis of the flow structures obtained in numerical simulations  @xcite have confirmed that this division of regimes coincides with changes observed in the flow patterns and flow characteristics .    in regime i (",
    "@xmath26 ) the large scale circulation ( lsc ) , typical for non - rotating rb convection , is still present , because the coriolis force is too weak to overcome the buoyancy force that causes the lsc .",
    "@xcite showed that there is a sharp transition to the regime where rotational effects become important , while at the same time the strength of the lsc is decreasing  @xcite .",
    "@xcite experimentally found that the time - averaged lsc amplitudes decrease strongly at the transition from regime i to regime ii , see figure 13 of their paper . in regime",
    "ii ( @xmath27 ) the lsc is replaced by predominantly vertically oriented vortical columns as the dominant flow structures and a large increase in the heat transport is observed .",

    "the effect of ekman pumping , and thus the observed heat transfer enhancement , depends strongly on the @xmath24- and @xmath25-values  @xcite .",
    "when the rotation rate is increased further a large decrease in the heat transport is observed , because the vertical velocity fluctuations are suppressed due to the rotation  @xcite .",

    "we compare the experimental data with the azimuthal temperature and vertical - velocity profiles close to the sidewall found in direct numerical simulations ( dns ) . in order to explain the sidewall temperature measurements we study the azimuthally averaged flow profiles obtained from dns .",
    "the analysis presented in section 5 reveals that the sidewall temperature measurements , particularly the presence of the vertical wall temperature gradients in regimes ii and iii  @xcite , can be explained by the presence of stewartson layers that are formed along the sidewall .",
    "based on the setup described by @xcite we have built a new rb setup in eindhoven , which is suitable for high precision heat transport measurements .",
    "the convection cell has a diameter @xmath16 and height @xmath15 of 250 mm , making the aspect ratio @xmath32 .",
    "the modular design of the setup provides the ability to perform measurements at different aspect ratios as well , although this paper will only describe the @xmath28 setup in detail . during rotating experiments the rb cell",
    "is placed on the eindhoven rotating table facility ( rtf )  ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "a rotating connection is available for coolant fluid , with separated in and out flow tubes .",
    "the rotation rate @xmath3 of the rtf can be controlled from 0 to 10 rad / s with a resolution of 0.001 rad / s and a relative accuracy of @xmath33 .",

    "five small holes ( one at the centre , two at a radius of 98 mm and two at 100 mm , i.e. in the space that is available between the heater wires that are placed inside the plate ) are drilled to within 0.7 mm of its top surface and thermistors are mounted in these holes .    on top of the bottom plate , the plexiglas sidewall @xmath42 with an inner diameter of 250 mm",
    "is placed .",
    "the thickness of the plexiglas sidewall is 10 mm to provide enough strength in strongly rrb experiments .",
    "a rubber o - ring seals the interface between the bottom plate and the sidewall and prevents any leakage of fluid .",
    "the sidewall contains a fluid inlet near the bottom plate and , at opposite angular position , an outlet adjacent to the top plate .",
    "care has been taken to avoid the entrapment of air in the convection cell , both when filling the cell and when heating the fluid .",
    "the sidewall is surrounded by an adiabatic side shield @xmath43 made of two 3 mm thick aluminium plates .",
    "the shield is actively temperature controlled , ensuring that its temperature is always close to the mean temperature of the system .",
    "additional insulation is present between the plexiglas side wall and the aluminium side shield .",
    "the top of the convection cell is formed by the copper top plate @xmath44 , which has similar dimensions as the bottom plate .",
    "the top plate contains a double spiral water channel of 8 mm width , 26 mm depth and 25 mm spacing .",
    "the water , coming from a refrigerated circulator ( thermo scientific haake dc50-k41 ) at 12.5 l / min , cools the top plate down to the desired temperature . from the top of the plate , five small holes ( one at the centre , four at a radius of 100 mm ) were drilled to within 0.7 mm of the copper - fluid interface and thermistors are mounted in these holes .",
    "the top plate is covered by a plexiglas top @xmath45 and the water channel is sealed with a rubber ring .",

    "it is supported by 6 stainless steel support poles . with these poles",
    ", the rb cell can be fixed to achieve a fully watertight connection between the plates and the sidewall . to decrease the effects of air convection near the convection cell",
    ", the entire construction is placed in a wooden box covered with a 40 mm insulating layer on the inside .",
    "the apparatus contains 40 thermistors , which were calibrated simultaneously in a separate apparatus against a laboratory standard . during the calibration procedure",
    "all thermistors and the laboratory standard are placed in an extremely well temperature - controlled batch ( temperature differences less than 0.002 k ) to determine the resistance at a set of known temperatures . from this calibration data fits",
    "were made with 5-th order logarithmic polynomials to calculate temperature values from 3-wire resistance measurements .",
    "deviations from these fits are generally less than 0.001 k. during the calibration procedure all thermistors are connected to the same software and hardware as in the real experiments .",
    "24 of these thermistors are placed in the sidewall , forming 3 rings of 8 equally spaced sensors at heights @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "both the top and bottom plate contain 5 sensors to monitor the temperature of the plate .",
    "the remaining sensors are used to control the temperature of the bottom adiabatic shield and of the insulation around the plexiglas sidewall .",
    "readings of all thermometer resistances and of the bottom plate heater current and heater voltage were taken every second .",
    "the top ( bottom ) temperature @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) was set equal to the area average of the five thermometers embedded in the top ( bottom ) plate . for any given data point ,",
    "measurements over typically the first four hours were discarded to avoid transients , and data taken over an additional period of at least another eight hours were averaged to get the heat - current density @xmath18 , and the temperatures @xmath50 and @xmath49 . because of the imperfect temperature uniformity of the bottom shield there was a small parasitic heat loss from the bottom plate of about @xmath51 w , which was determined by measuring the required power to keep the bottom and top plate at @xmath52 , a measurement which takes two days . for each measurement this parasitic heat loss was subtracted from the measured power .",
    "the measurements have been verified against the experiments of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for the present measurements the difference is in the order of @xmath53 ,",
    "well within the differences observed between different rb setups  @xcite . in figure [ figure nusseltgamma1eindhoven ] we show the heat transfer enhancement @xmath54 as function of the rotation rate @xmath21 for @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 at @xmath58 , which corresponds with a mean temperature of the fluid of @xmath59c , and compare them with similar heat transport measurements reported in the literature  @xcite .",

    "in rb experiments it is common to determine the flow properties by analyzing the azimuthal wall temperature profile obtained by thermistors that are embedded in the sidewall  @xcite and in our setup we do the same .",
    "following @xcite we define the relative lsc strength at midheight ( @xmath70 ) , based on the energy in the different modes of the azimuthal temperature profile , as @xmath71 here @xmath72 indicates the sum of the energy in the first fourier mode over time , i.e. from the beginning of the simulation @xmath73 to the end of the simulation @xmath74 , @xmath75 the sum of the total energy in all fourier modes over time , and @xmath76 the total number of fourier modes that can be determined .",
    "the relative lsc strength @xmath70 always has a value between @xmath77 and @xmath78 ; here @xmath78 indicates that the azimuthal profile is a pure cosine profile , which is a signature of the lsc according to @xcite , and @xmath77 indicates that the magnitude of the cosine mode is equal to ( or weaker than ) the value expected from a random noise signal .",
    "hence @xmath79 indicates that a cosine fit on average is a reasonable approximation of the data , as then most energy in the signal resides in the first fourier mode .",
    "in contrast , @xmath80 indicates that most energy resides in the higher fourier modes .",
    "hence , we consider the lsc as dominant once @xmath79 at midheight .",
    "a small value of @xmath70 indicates that no single lsc is found , implying the existence of either multiple rolls or , in the case of rotating rayleigh - bnard ( rrb ) convection , vertically aligned vortices .",
    "figure [ figure fourier experimental](a ) shows the magnitude of the different fourier modes of the azimuthal wall temperature profile for the experiments at @xmath57 with @xmath58 based on the data of eight equally spaced thermistors placed inside the sidewall ( located at @xmath81 ) .",
    "the corresponding relative lsc strength is given in panel b. the figure clearly shows that the relative lsc strength is large in regime i , which indicates the presence of a lsc .",
    "however , for higher rotation rates , i.e. regime ii , the relative lsc strength decreases because vertically aligned vortices become the dominant feature of the flow . for this flow one",
    "expects a random azimuthal temperature profile at midheight , which is confirmed by the low relative lsc strength @xmath82 in regime ii and iii , see figure [ figure fourier experimental](b ) .",
    "extensive sidewall temperature gradient measurements for non - rotating rb convection were done by @xcite and for rrb convection by @xcite , see their figures 10 and 11 .",
    "when the lsc is the dominant feature of the flow the vertical temperature gradient at the sidewall is mainly due to plumes that travel close to the sidewall with the lsc .",
    "thus one would expect that the temperature gradient along the sidewall should decrease in regime ii as the lsc disappears there .",
    "however figure 10 of @xcite shows that the temperature gradient along the sidewall even increases in regime ii and iii .",
    "this nonzero temperature gradient along the sidewall in regime ii and iii is caused by the secondary flow that will be discussed in section [ section_ekman_stewartson ] .",
    "further interesting information about the lsc can be found in figure  @xmath83 of  @xcite .",
    "the figure shows that the temperature amplitude of the lsc , i.e. the strength of the first fourier mode , starts to decrease at  @xmath84 and that the lsc ceases to contribute significantly for  @xmath85 .",
    "thus our experimental results in figure  [ figure fourier experimental ] are in good agreement with the results of  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the measurements of  @xcite reveal an increase in the lsc strength between  @xmath86 and  @xmath84 . in our data",
    "this effect is not visible , since we do not have enough measurement points in regime i. as is discussed by  @xcite there is no well - accepted theoretical explanation for this phenomenon at the moment .",
    "we shall now consider the results of dns of rrb convection performed at various  @xmath4 values for  @xmath87 and  @xmath23  ( see details in * ? ? ? * ) and for  @xmath88 and  @xmath89  ( see details in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are in the same parameter regime as the experiments discussed above . in the simulations we solved the three - dimensional navier - stokes equations within the boussinesq approximation in a cylindrical cell with @xmath28 with no - slip boundary conditions at all walls , a uniform temperature at the horizontal plates , and an adiabatic sidewall .",
    "for further details about the numerical code we refer to @xcite and @xcite . in all simulations",
    "we calculate the azimuthal averages of the three velocity components and the temperature .",
    "furthermore , in the simulations at @xmath90 we placed @xmath91 azimuthally equally spaced numerical probes that provide simultaneous point - wise measurements of the temperature and the three velocity components @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 in the radial , azimuthal , and vertical directions @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively , at the heights @xmath46 , @xmath98 , and @xmath48 and a distances @xmath99 from the cylinder axis . the azimuthal temperature and vertical - velocity profiles measured by the probes are analyzed in the same way as the experimental data .",
    "figure [ figure fourier numerical ] shows the magnitude of the different fourier modes of the azimuthal vertical - velocity profiles for @xmath90 and @xmath23 based on the data of @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath91 equally spaced probes . the result in panel ( a ) agrees well with the result obtained by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a comparison of the relative energy in the different fourier modes based on the data of @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath91 probes , see figure [ figure fourier numerical ] , reveals that @xmath100 probes are insufficient to capture all flow characteristics . since the results based on the data of @xmath101 and @xmath91 probes are very similar , we assume that @xmath101 probes should be sufficient to capture all relevant features of the azimuthal profiles",
    ".    fortunately , the data of @xmath100 equally spaced thermistors are already sufficient to reliably calculate @xmath82 for non - rotating rb convection , see @xcite . to confirm this observation for the rrb case ( and validate the experimental results with @xmath100 probes discussed in section [ section experiments ] )",
    "we therefore calculate @xmath82 based on the data of @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath91 equally spaced probes .",
    "the result is given in figure [ figure fourier numerical](d ) , which shows that the curves for the relative lsc strength almost collapse for the three cases .",
    "moreover , the numerical data are in good agreement with the experimental result shown in figure [ figure fourier experimental ] , including the large decrease of @xmath82 at the transition between regimes i and ii . the small value of the relative lsc strength ( @xmath102 ) suggests the absence of the lsc and that the azimuthal temperature profile at midheight becomes random in regime ii and iii .",
    "this is confirmed by a three - dimensional visualization of the flow , see figure 5 of @xcite , where it is shown that in regime ii vertically aligned vortices are the dominant feature of the flow .",
    "we note that figure  [ figure fourier numerical ] shows a continuous decrease of the relative lsc strength , which is in disagreement with the measurements of  @xcite that show a small increase in the temperature amplitude of the lsc between  @xmath86 and  @xmath84 .",
    "this difference might be caused by the slightly different monitoring locations ( inside the sidewall in the experiments and at the radial position @xmath99 in the numerical simulations ) .",
    "in this section we will first discuss the flow characteristics for regimes i and ii and sketch the influence of background rotation on the mean flow in general terms , and the role of the ekman and stewartson boundary layers is emphasized .",
    "subsequently , we provide physical explanations for the structure of the mean flow as observed for regime ii . finally , we discuss the implications for the mean temperature gradient at the sidewall of the convection cell .      in figure [ figure averaged velocity ] we show the azimuthally averaged temperature and velocity components @xmath94 , @xmath93 and @xmath92 for three typical rotation regimes : ( the top row ) @xmath103 ( no rotation , regime i ) , ( the middle row ) @xmath104 ( weak rotation , regime i ) and ( the bottom row ) @xmath105 ( moderate rotation , regime ii ) at @xmath106 and @xmath107 . the left - hand side of each picture ( @xmath108 ) represents the position of the cylinder axis ( dash - dotted line ) , while the right - hand side ( @xmath109 ) corresponds with the sidewall .",
    "in addition to the azimuthal averaginging , they have also been averaged in time for more than one hundred large - eddy turnover times to find the mean circulation hidden under the turbulent fluctuations .",
    "a close - up of the thermal and flow structure in the bottom corner of the tank for the case @xmath105 ( see figure [ figure averaged velocity]c ) is shown in figure [ figure averaged velocity zoom ] .",
    "we note that the averaged profiles for lower @xmath24 values are similar to the ones presented in figure [ figure averaged velocity ] .    for the non - rotating case ( @xmath103 ) , shown in [ figure averaged velocity](a )",
    ", we observe the signature of the lsc . when looking at a vertical cross - section of the domain , the cross - sectional plane aligned with the lsc , the mean circulation has an elliptic shape with its major axis oriented at some angle with the cylinder axis ( see the sketch in figure [ figure lscorientation ] , and also in @xcite ) . it is due to this mean tilt of the elliptic lsc , combined with the rotation sense as shown in figure [ figure lscorientation ] , that the _ azimuthal _ average of this flow is not zero ; especially upward and downward motions are separated in these azimuthally averaged plots . in the top half upward motion ( positive @xmath94 ) is found near the cylinder axis , while the downward flow ( negative @xmath94 ) is strongest near the sidewall .",
    "the opposite situation is found for @xmath94 in the bottom half .",
    "the azimuthal velocity @xmath93 does not show a well - defined mean profile , just some small fluctuations .",
    "the averaged radial velocity @xmath92 has maximal values near the intersections of the horizontal plates with the sidewall , consistent with the averaged vertical velocity @xmath94 near these regions .",
    "note also the weak radially inward flow near the sidewall around midheight .",
    "when a small rotation is introduced [ @xmath104 , figure [ figure averaged velocity](b ) ] , a first observation is that the mean velocities become smaller ( except the averaged azimuthal velocity @xmath93 which grows due to organization of the azimuthal flow ) .",
    "the vertical velocity @xmath94 still has the dominant structuring due to the lsc , but especially near the cylinder axis some disturbances appear . for the azimuthal velocity",
    "a well - defined structure emerges due to the azimuthal averaging .",
    "the coriolis force , deviating the parts of the lsc with mean horizontal velocity to the right with respect to the local direction of the ( mean ) horizontal flow , is driving the organization of an average azimuthal flow .",
    "the blue regions near the corners in the plot of the azimuthal velocity @xmath93 represent the anticyclonic motion induced by the mean horizontal outward flow of the lsc ( near the bottom and top plates , see figure [ figure lscorientation ] ) .",
    "the sketch of the lsc motion shows that the up ( down ) going plumes are first traveling straight up ( down ) , before the radial inward flow of the lsc sets in .",
    "the cyclonic motion that is observed in the central sidewall region of the azimuthally averaged azimuthal velocity is due to the radial inward flow of the lsc in the top ( bottom ) half of the cell for the upward ( downward ) branch of the lsc , see figure [ figure lscorientation ] .",
    "this radial inward flow of the lsc results in a spin - up , i.e. in cyclonic azimuthal motion , by the action of the coriolis force .",
    "this mechanism is equivalent to conservation of angular momentum : radial inward motion ( @xmath110 ) of fluid parcels results in an increase of @xmath93 , i.e. in cyclonic motion . because this radial inward flow is in the top ( bottom ) part of the sample for the up ( down ) going plumes this results , after azimuthal averaging , in one central sidewall region in which a cyclonic motion is found .",
    "this means that this particular snapshot , can not be used for interpretation of the movement of individual plumes traveling from bottom to top and the other way around .",
    "however , in this very schematic picture it does seem to be consistent with experimental measurements of the anticyclonic motion of the lsc @xcite as both upgoing and downgoing plumes get anticyclonic deflection by the mean anticyclonic azimuthal flow near the plates and any effect of mean cyclonic flow becomes effective only for @xmath111 ( for upgoing plumes ) and @xmath112 ( for downgoing plumes ) .",
    "at much higher rotation rates , i.e. for larger @xmath21-values , the lsc no longer exists , and the secondary circulation takes on a different appearance .",
    "it is obvious from the velocity plots that relatively large mean velocities occur in thin regions near the solid container walls .",
    "a division of the domain into several regions is appropriate , being the bulk interior domain , the ekman layers at the horizontal plates , and the stewartson layer at the sidewall .",
    "the ekman layers have a ( non - dimensional ) thickness @xmath113 ( with the ekman number defined as  @xmath114 , representing an inverse reynolds number based on the length scale @xmath15 and velocity scale @xmath115 ) .",
    "the stewartson layer at the sidewall has a sandwich structure consisting of a thicker outer layer of non - dimensional thickness @xmath116 and a thinner inner layer of non - dimensional thickness @xmath117 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the dashed lines in figure [ figure averaged velocity](c ) and figure [ figure averaged velocity zoom ] indicate these typical layer thicknesses . in figure",
    "[ figure averaged velocity zoom ] the bottom right - hand corner is magnified for the temperature ( top panel ) and each of the velocity components , so that the various boundary layers are more easily recognized . note that since the secondary circulation associated with the ekman and stewartson layers is weak , the mean velocities @xmath92 and @xmath94 in the bulk are very small and therefore hardly noticeable , as is confirmed by the simulation results . it should be emphasized that the secondary circulation found here is considerably different from that found by @xcite or that of @xcite , both driven by centrifugal buoyancy .",
    "in both these works the up - down symmetry is broken due to centrifugal accelerations having opposite directions near the plates , viz .",
    "cold fluid near the top plate accelerates radially outward while hot fluid near the bottom plate goes radially inward .",
    "here we disregard centrifugal acceleration and up - down symmetry is preserved .",
    "it must also be stated that the aforementioned circulation is only of secondary magnitude .",
    "the still - turbulent field of the vortical plumes is dominant .",
    "the most remarkable change is observed in the distribution of the azimuthal velocity @xmath93 : in the bulk of the domain an anticyclonic flow ( @xmath118 , indicated by blue in figure [ figure averaged velocity]c ) is present , while a thin band of cyclonic flow ( @xmath119 , indicated by red ) is visible only close to the sidewall .",
    "simulations for the parameter range @xmath120 ( not shown here ) revealed that for increasing rotation rates ( increasing @xmath21-values ) the cyclonic flow region becomes confined to a region near the sidewall of increasingly smaller size .",
    "these observations suggest that in this @xmath4-regime the ekman and stewartson layers play an essential role in the mean secondary circulation , even though this circulation is relatively weak and even continuously disturbed by the non - steady thermally driven turbulent plumes that are present throughout the flow domain .",

    "although the exact mechanism causing this bulk motion is an open question , we offer a possible explanation as follows . the heated fluid rising upward from the bottom plate and",
    "the cooled fluid flowing downward from the top plate result in a radially outward mean flow in the bulk of the domain , as sketched in the  @xmath123 plane in figure  [ fig : sketches](a ) .",
    "although this radial motion is relatively weak , conservation of angular momentum ( @xmath124 , with @xmath125 the absolute azimuthal velocity ) implies that the absolute swirl velocity of fluid parcels will decrease , i.e. in the co - rotating frame this fluid will acquire an anticyclonic azimuthal motion ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "this radial outflow in the bulk of the domain is of such small magnitude that it leaves no strong trace in the azimuthally averaged radial velocity  @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , the plots of averaged vertical velocity  @xmath94 show no mean motion directed away from the horizontal plates : this transport is localised in the small thermal vortices that vanish after azimuthal averaging .",
    "this picture of the flow is not complete , however , because a second mechanism is active simultaneously in the bulk of the domain : the spin - up process  @xcite .",
    "this second process is driven by the ekman layers ( figure  [ fig : sketches]b ) : the bottom ekman layer imposes a suction velocity on the interior given by @xmath126 in dimensionless form , with @xmath127 the vertical component of the rotation of the relative interior flow . to clarify ,",
    "as  @xmath127 is anticyclonic , the corresponding vertical velocity according to the suction condition is directed from the bulk into the ekman layer .",
    "a similar suction velocity is imposed on the interior flow by the upper ekman layer , also directed from the bulk to the boundary layer .",
    "there is thus a mean flow from the bulk into the ekman layers . by conservation of mass ,",
    "a radial outflow in the ekman layers is needed to carry away the flux from the bulk into the ekman layers .",
    "the radial outflow is easily identified in the averaged radial velocity plots due to the tiny radial cross - sectional area of the ekman layer , leading to a relatively large mean velocity .",
    "the radially outward transport through the ekman layers is returned via a stewartson boundary layer at the cylinder wall .",
    "this layer has a small mean radial inward transport into the interior distributed along its vertical extent .",
    "an indication of this radially inward transport is found in the  @xmath92 plot of figure  [ figure averaged velocity zoom ] at  @xmath128 .",
    "there is also an internal recirculation in this layer : again , according to the principle of conservation of angular momentum @xmath129 , with @xmath125 , the radial inward motion from the sidewall boundary layer in the bulk implies a change in the swirl velocity , which is reduced in magnitude and approaches zero .",
    "it can be shown that the matching of the azimuthal velocity component @xmath130 to the sidewall requires a stewartson layer of typical thickness  @xmath131 , in which this velocity is given by @xmath132 , with @xmath15 the height of the cylinder , and @xmath133 the stretched radial boundary - layer coordinate  @xcite .",
    "when referring to this principal velocity component as being @xmath134 , the vertical and radial velocity components in this layer are much smaller , viz . @xmath135 and @xmath136 , respectively ( in non - dimensional terms ) .",
    "the radial velocity is also correctly matched to the sidewall .",
    "however , matching of the vertical velocity to the cylinder wall requires the presence of a thinner @xmath137 layer _ inside _ the @xmath131 layer .",
    "the vertical matching implies a principal solution with a vertical velocity @xmath138 within this layer .",
    "however , the entire velocity field in the  @xmath137 layer carries no net vertical flux ; it is just an internal recirculation  @xcite .",
    "we will now describe the internal recirculation in more detail .",
    "where the stewartson @xmath137 layer meets the ekman layers , the vertical velocity has a singular structure  @xcite : @xmath139 at @xmath140 and @xmath15 , with @xmath141 the stretched radial coordinate in this stewartson layer , and @xmath142 the dirac delta function .",
    "signs of these singular eruptions of the ekman layer fluxes at @xmath140 and @xmath143 into the thinner stewartson layer on the sidewall are clearly visible in the @xmath94-plot in figure [ figure averaged velocity](c ) , and for the case of the bottom corner in figure [ figure averaged velocity zoom ] . note that these vertical fluxes are positive and negative near the bottom and top ekman layers , respectively .",
    "weaker vertical velocities of opposite signs are observed in the thicker @xmath131 layer , see figure [ figure averaged velocity](c ) .",
    "this oppositely signed vertical velocity next to the peak corresponds with the internal recirculation of the singular upward flux .",
    "furthermore , the radial branches of the internal recirculation can be recognised in the  @xmath144 plots .",
    "close to the bottom and top plates there is strong radially outward flow in the thin ekman boundary layers , which corresponds to strongly negative azimuthal velocity ( corner regions near the sidewall of figures  [ figure averaged velocity](c ) and  [ figure averaged velocity zoom ] ) . along the sidewall",
    "away from the plates there is radial inflow to close this recirculation , which , due to the much larger vertical extent , is of such small magnitude that it is not found in the plot of mean radial velocity .",
    "however , the radial inflow leaves its signature on the mean azimuthal velocity : radial inflow corresponds to positive  @xmath144 , which is observed as the orange band near the sidewall in the  @xmath144 plot of figure  [ figure averaged velocity](c ) .     for @xmath145 and @xmath107 for @xmath105 .",
    "the azimuthal , radial , and axial velocity components are indicated in red , black , and blue , respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to further illustrate the secondary circulation we consider radial mean profiles of velocity .",
    "figure [ fig : rossby0.30](a ) shows the azimuthally averaged velocity profiles @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 at @xmath149 according to a numerical simulation for @xmath105 .",
    "the radial @xmath93-distribution clearly shows the presence of anticyclonic swirl in the interior domain , while significant positive swirl exists in the region close to the cylinder wall .",
    "the vertical velocity shows the peaked structure close to the cylinder wall , indicating the singular eruption of the ekman flux into the @xmath137 layer , with accompanying negative velocity directly adjacent to close the recirculation .",
    "furthermore , the radial inflow in the sidewall region can be observed here , corresponding to positive  @xmath144 . in this normalised plot",
    "this radial - velocity structure may be recognised , yet in absolute sense the radial velocity component is much smaller than the vertical and azimuthal contributions .",
    "the description of the secondary circulation is only qualitative , as a full quantitative treatment would lead too far for the purpose of the current paper . a quantitative treatment of the secondary circulation will be presented in a forthcoming paper .    additional evidence that the mean velocity profiles close to the sidewall are indeed governed by stewartson boundary layer dynamics is provided in figure [ fig : stewartson ] , where it is shown that the thickness of the sidewall boundary layers observed in the simulations follows the theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "the role of ekman and stewartson boundary layer dynamics on the average mean flow is here illustrated with numerical simulations with @xmath150 and @xmath89 .",
    "separate sets of simulations with @xmath87 with @xmath23 and @xmath151 with @xmath89 essentially revealed the same picture .",
    "the explanation provided in this section is therefore applicable to a range of rayleigh numbers .",
    "further studies are needed to explore the regime with @xmath152 and the role of the prandtl number .",
    "we have also explored the role of the rossby number , in particular by increasing the value of @xmath21 such that the flow is dominated by strong rotation ( close to and even in regime iii ) .",
    "the vertical vortex plumes then become stronger and data from azimuthally averaged components of velocity reveal an increasing number of alternating , vertically almost homogeneous regions of @xmath118 and @xmath119 .     and @xmath89 .",
    "the dimensionless viscous boundary layer thickness near the plates is indicated by the circles .",
    "the dimensionless boundary layer thickness of the viscous boundary layers near the sidewall , i.e. the stewartson layers , is indicated by the squares and follows the scaling of the inner stewartson boundary layer thickness , i.e. @xmath153 . adapted from @xcite.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]      the above observations of the flow structure enable us to explain the sidewall temperature measurements . in figure [ figure radial tempprofile ] we have plotted radial distributions of the azimuthally averaged temperature and vertical velocity at @xmath149 .",
    "three main observations from the data extracted at this particular level are : a strong vertical mean flow near the sidewall ( and for the highest rotation rate clearly within the @xmath137 layer ) , an increase of the mean temperature in the bulk with the rotation rate , and an increased mean temperature near the sidewall compared to the bulk , regardless of the existence of the lsc .",
    "we start with the latter observation . in regime",
    "i ( weak rotation ) where the lsc is the dominant feature of the flow , the temperature gradient at the sidewall is caused by the lsc , which carries warm fluid upwards along the sidewall and cold fluid down in the middle ( when considered in an azimuthally - averaged plot ) ; and vice versa in the top half of the cylindrical domain . in regime",
    "ii ( moderate rotation ) the lsc has disappeared and vertical vortices form the dominant feature of the flow . in this regime the secondary circulation described above causes a flow directed vertically away from the plate close to the sidewall , i.e. the singular eruption into the @xmath137 layer , see figure [ figure radial tempprofile](b ) .",
    "this means that in regime ii the secondary circulation carries warm fluid upwards along the sidewall in the lower half of the cylinder and cold fluid downwards along the sidewall in the top half .",
    "the vertical temperature gradient on the sidewall is increased .",
    "the enhanced mean temperature in the bulk with increasing rotation rate indicates that the vertical temperature gradient in the bulk increases also with increasing @xmath21 , see for example figure 15 of @xcite .",
    "the bulk temperature gradient is caused by the merger of vertical plumes  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. the enhanced horizontal mixing of the temperature anomaly of the plumes results in a mean temperature gradient . in regime",
    "iii this temperature gradient in the bulk becomes stronger than in regime ii and eventually becomes equal to the temperature gradient at the sidewall .",
    "based on the experimental data and results obtained from dns we studied the characteristics of the azimuthal temperature profiles at the sidewall .",
    "we find that in regime i ( weak rotation ) the lsc is the dominant feature of the flow . in the sidewall temperature measurements",
    "this is identified by the strong presence of the first fourier mode in the signal . when the rotation is increased a sudden onset in the heat transport enhancement",
    "is found that indicates the beginning of regime ii , the moderate rotation regime . in this regime",
    "the lsc is replaced by vertically aligned vortices and due to their random position the magnitude of the first fourier mode is very weak , which confirms that the lsc has disappeared .",
    "this feature is also observed in regime iii , where the heat transfer decreases , because the vertical velocity fluctuations are suppressed by the rotation .",
    "when the lsc is the dominant feature of the flow the vertical temperature gradient at the sidewall is mainly due to plumes that travel close to the sidewall because they travel with the lsc .",
    "however , also in regime ii and iii , in which the lsc is absent , there is a strong temperature gradient at the sidewall . in these regimes , where the vertical vortices are the dominant feature of the flow , the observed vertical temperature gradient along the sidewall is mainly due to the secondary flow .",
    "the secondary flow , driven by the ekman boundary layers near the plates , causes a recirculation in the stewartson boundary layer on the sidewall with upward ( downward ) transport of hot ( cold ) fluid close to the sidewall in the bottom ( top ) part of the cell .",
    "it is remarkable that the secondary flow in turbulent rb convection , which is observed after time - averaging of the flow field , is so well described by linear ekman and stewartson boundary layer theory .",
    "it seems that the mean laminar flow profiles prevail , hidden under highly turbulent fluctuations .",
    "thus the knowledge about laminar flow dynamics can still be highly relevant in the study of turbulent flows .",
    "an example is the grossmann ",
    "lohse ( gl ) theory  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an overview ) , in which the kinetic energy and thermal variance dissipation rates have been decomposed into boundary - layer and bulk contributions . scaling - wise and in a time - averaged sense a laminar prandtl",
    " blasius profile is assumed close to the horizontal plates .",
    "the gl theory successfully describes the  @xmath20 and  @xmath154 number dependences on  @xmath24 and  @xmath25 .",
    "recently , @xcite and  @xcite have shown that the laminar pb profile is indeed hidden under the turbulent fluctuations .",
