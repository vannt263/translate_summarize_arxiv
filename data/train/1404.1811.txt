    "complex networks can be found everywhere in our world , ranging from neuronal architectures to galactic filaments and from facebook to transportation systems @xcite . to understand the behavior of these systems requires both powerful analytic tools and access to large data sets .",
    "thanks to the rapid pace of development in information technology , considerable amount of data can be collected and systematic descriptions of various features of these systems have been initiated . at the same time , an interdisciplinary academic field  network science  has become quite mature , establishing a powerful framework for characterizing and analyzing complex networks , as well as applying network representations successfully to study physical , biological , and infrastructure systems . in this context ,",
    "early studies focus mainly on _ static _ networks , and are quite adequate for describing networks such as power grids and highways , whose topology can be regarded as constant ( within the time scales of interest ) . however , in many other situations , such as social networks , a _ dynamic _ description would be more appropriate . yet",
    ", there are far fewer studies for such networks .",
    "recent and notable examples include the time evolution of network topology @xcite , dynamical processes on networks @xcite , as well as the combination of both , namely , adaptive co - evolutionary networks @xcite . within the physics community ,",
    "most of these studies have focused on single isolated networks , putting aside the fact that real world systems are highly interconnected and therefore should be modelled as interacting networks .",
    "for instance , smartphones can help drivers avoid heavy traffic .",
    "this situation can not be fully described in terms of a single network , whether we focus on cellular communication or the transportation ( road ) network .",
    "therefore , models with interdependent networks are needed , culminating perhaps , in a ` theory of networks of networks . ' in recent years , the significance of interdependent networks has begun to attract attention , and some aspects of such networks have been probed .",
    "those studies include the investigation of critical infrastructure interdependencies rinaldipeerenboomkelly01,panzierisetola08,vespignani10,buldyrevparshanipaulstanleyhavlin10,buldyrevsherecwilich11 , and approaches such as the multilayer method to couple traffic flows to physical infrastructures @xcite .",
    "while our ultimate goal is to understand the interdependence of dynamic networks , we begin with simple model systems , in order to gain some insight into the effects of interactions . in particular , we focus on networks with ` preferred degrees , ' which allow us to implement both dynamics and interactions easily . in the first paper of this series @xcite",
    ", we introduced such a dynamic network , in which each node is pre - assigned a preferred degree ( @xmath0 ) and , when chosen to act , adds / cuts links to reach and maintain @xmath0 . since the dynamics does not obey detailed balance in general , these systems settle eventually into _ non - equilibrium steady states _",
    "( in contrast to systems in thermal equilibrium controlled by boltzmann weights ) . in our studies here ,",
    "we devote attention solely to such states .",
    "we first consider a homogeneous population and discover some unexpected properties of this network .",
    "then , we introduce a coupling between two such networks and investigate the effects of their interaction . in @xcite , we focused predominantly on various degree distributions and found that they differ significantly from the poisson in a standard erds - rnyi random network @xcite . within",
    "the limited range of parameter space studied there , the degree distributions ( @xmath1 s ) can be reasonably explained by a mean - field approach . for a few special choices of parameters , we already noted that the interaction between just two populations can induce highly non - trivial behavior of @xmath2 , the total number of cross - links between them . in this paper",
    ", we probe the parameter space more systematically , focusing specifically on the properties of the mean , @xmath3 , and standard deviation , @xmath4 . in some special cases ,",
    "we delve into more detail , such as various degree distributions in the steady state ( @xmath5 ) , as well as the distribution for the cross - links : @xmath6 .",
    "for a homogeneous population , by defining @xmath2 to be the total number of cross - links between two identical partitions , we find the stationary distribution @xmath6 to be a narrowly peaked distribution , well described by a gaussian .",
    "by contrast , for a very similar two - network model , which we refer to as the ` symmetric system , ' @xmath6 displays a broad and flat plateau !",
    "moreover , the power spectrum of @xmath7 shows that the dynamics of @xmath2 is consistent with an _ unbiased _ random walk ( within some bounds ) .",
    "the dramatic difference between such similar models illustrates that the non - trivial behavior of @xmath2 is indeed a consequence of the interaction between networks .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the specifications of our models and introduce several quantities that serve to describe the topology of our networks . in section 3 , we show the monte carlo simulation results along with some analytical understandings . in the last section , we provide a summary and outlook for this paper .",
    "recently , we introduced a class of dynamic networks evolving according to one or more preferred degrees @xcite .",
    "the motivation of such a model lies with the belief that , in typical social settings , an individual would _ prefer _ to have a certain number of contacts .",
    "for example , an introvert may prefer only a handful of friends , while an extrovert would be glad to have hundreds or thousands of contacts .",
    "of course , real social interactions are far more complex , and so we use the notion of ` extroverts ' and ` introverts ' only as an illustration . for the readers convenience ,",
    "we briefly summarize the main features of our model here .",
    "in the simplest case , we model a homogeneous population of @xmath8 nodes ( individuals ) , all assigned the same ` preferred degree , ' @xmath0 . when chosen for updates , a node will attempt to add or cut one of its links based on @xmath0 . in each attempt ,",
    "a node is randomly chosen , its degree ( @xmath9 ) is noted , and depending on whether @xmath9 is smaller / larger than @xmath0 , @xmath9 will be increased / decreased by one .",
    "( to avoid ambiguity , @xmath0 is always chosen to be slightly larger than the integer quoted , e.g. , @xmath10 really means @xmath11 . here , this step is deterministic , while stochastic rules can be implemented @xcite . ) in this sense , a node ` prefers ' to have degree @xmath0 . for simplicity",
    ", the action of adding / cutting is performed on a randomly chosen partner which has no / a link with the node .",
    "the partner node is passive and has no influence on this action .",
    "self - loops and multiple connections are not allowed . in our simulation ,",
    "one monte carlo step ( mcs ) consists of @xmath8 such attempts , so that , on the average , each node has one chance to take action .",
    "clearly , the network is dynamic , while the node attributes remain static . at large times",
    ", the system will reach a steady state , with statistically stationary network topology .",
    "not surprisingly , the average degree is @xmath0 .",
    "however , despite the appearance of randomness , the degree distribution is neither poisson nor gaussian , but laplacian @xcite .",
    "our goal is to study interactions between two such networks , with different @xmath12 s and @xmath8 s in general .",
    "one quantity of interest is @xmath2 , the total number of cross - links between the two networks .",
    "@xmath2 is clearly a quantitative measure of the interaction between them .",
    "next , let us introduce the ` interactions . '",
    "of course , there are infinitely many ways to do so and we can explore only a few , motivated by what seems the most likely behavior between individuals in two populations . in this paper , we begin with arguably the simplest : @xmath13 , the probability a node acts ( add or cut ) on a cross - link . a few other forms of natural ` interactions ' will be considered in the last paper of this series .",
    "consider two preferred degree networks ( labelled by @xmath14 ) , with @xmath15 nodes , preferred degrees @xmath16 , and cross - link action @xmath17 . in each attempt ,",
    "one node is chosen at random from all the @xmath8 ( @xmath18 ) nodes .",
    "if the degree of this node is lower / higher than @xmath16 , it will attempt to add / cut a link . with probability @xmath17 , this action will be taken with a partner node from the _ other _ network .",
    "thus , an intra - community link will be updated with probability @xmath19 . in all cases",
    ", the partner node will be randomly picked from the chosen group . if a suitable partner does not exist ( e.g. ,",
    "when the action is to cut and there are no links to nodes in the chosen community ) , then no action is taken . as usual ,",
    "one mcs involves @xmath8 such attempts . in all our simulations ,",
    "the initial network is entirely devoid of links , i.e. , a null graph .    with this set - up , the parameters @xmath17 clearly control the behavior of @xmath2 . in the extreme case of @xmath20 , @xmath21 as the two networks decouple completely .",
    "at the other extreme , @xmath22 , the system consists of only bipartite graphs , though not a complete one in general ( @xmath23 ) . with only cross - links ,",
    "such a system may be regarded as ` fully interacting . ' in this sense , @xmath13 plays the role of an interaction strength .",
    "one of the standard characterizations of the topology of a network is the degree distribution , @xmath24 . denoting by @xmath25 the number of nodes with @xmath9 links in each measurement ,",
    "@xmath24 is given by @xmath26 for a homogeneous network with a single preferred degree , this @xmath27 is , as expected , sharply peaked around @xmath0 . in a system with two sub - networks with different preferred degrees , it is expected to be bimodal , especially if the @xmath0 s are far apart .",
    "thus , it is sensible to consider separate distributions , @xmath28 , associated with nodes in community @xmath29 which have degree @xmath9 . beyond these , we may extend our considerations to the next level of detail , @xmath30 , associated with @xmath31 , denoting the number of links with which a node in community @xmath29 is connected to nodes in community @xmath32 . note that @xmath33 , since the average number of cross - links @xmath3 is equal to both @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "though somewhat cumbersome ( compared to @xmath36 ) , we will use the notation above , to leave no doubt about which quantity is being considered .",
    "we will also refer to @xmath37 as a ` global degree distribution , ' reserving the terms internal / external degree distribution for @xmath38 / @xmath39",
    ". our study will be mainly for the steady state , for which we add the superscript @xmath40 , e.g. , @xmath41 .    of course",
    ", we can proceed further and consider joint distributions , such as @xmath42 , the probability that a node in community @xmath43 will be found with degrees @xmath44 _ and _ @xmath45 , etc . for this paper , however , we will limit ourselves to the less detailed distributions .",
    "clearly , @xmath46 while @xmath38 and @xmath39  are simple projections of @xmath47 , e.g. , @xmath48 .",
    "these remarks show that @xmath37 , e.g. , can not be obtained from @xmath38 and @xmath39 in general .",
    "as we are interested in the behavior of the cross - network interactions , most of our attention will be on cross - links .",
    "while much information is stored in @xmath39 , it is more efficient to study the ` macroscopic ' quantity , @xmath2 , specifically its mean , @xmath3 , and standard deviation , @xmath4 . for a special case ( see eqn .",
    "( [ symmetric ] ) below ) , its time dependence in the steady state will be analyzed in more detail .",
    "thus , @xmath49 will be used to compile a histogram which represents @xmath50 , while its power spectrum will be exploited to reveal the nature of the dynamics leading to @xmath51 . in particular ,",
    "a surprising discovery is that , under certain conditions , @xmath2 performs an unbiased random walk over an extremely large fraction of its available range , so that @xmath51 displays a broad plateau instead of a sharp peak .    to determine which aspects of the interaction are crucial for the emergence of such remarkable phenomena , we compare two very similar systems .",
    "one is a homogeneous network of @xmath52 nodes with @xmath0 . arbitrarily labelling half of them as ` red ' and the rest ` blue , ' we mimic having two communities and define @xmath2 as the total number of ` red - blue ' links .",
    "the other system is the ` symmetric ' two - network model : @xmath53 the apparent symmetry between the two communities may lead us to expect that the behavior of @xmath2 in this system should be similar to that in the homogeneous population . as will be shown in the next section ,",
    "this naive expectation is far from fulfilled and the simple interaction associated with @xmath13 has a profound effect on the macroscopic @xmath2 .    finally , in a social network with introverts and extroverts ,",
    "` frustration ' is unavoidable . instead of a qualitative notion , ` frustration '",
    "can be quantified in our model .",
    "for example , consider @xmath54 .",
    "since a node plays a passive role for much of the time ( as other individuals add / cut links to it ) , we should expect an introvert / extrovert ( characterized by @xmath55 ) to find itself mostly with more / less contacts than it prefers . in the steady state , we may define ` frustration ' for _ individual _ @xmath56 by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the degree distribution of @xmath59 alone ( and not of the population as a whole )",
    ". with @xmath60   $ ] , its magnitude is a measure of how frustrated @xmath56 is , while the sign provides its propensity to add / cut in its attempt to seek relief .",
    "although we will not study this quantity in detail , we will use the concept in later discussions . specifically , in the third paper of this series liubasslerschmittmannzia14 , we will investigate a ` maximally frustrated ' population of extreme introverts ( @xmath61 ) and extroverts ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "preliminary results of this system , reported elsewhere @xcite , showed the existence of a sharp transition in @xmath2 when @xmath63 changes sign .",
    "in general , there are three pairs of relevant control parameters when coupling two preferred degree networks with @xmath13 , namely , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 . exploring such a 6-dimensional space is beyond the scope of our study .",
    "we content ourselves with a limited region in certain subspaces , as most of our simulations focus on @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "in particular , we begin with a symmetric system , eqn .",
    "( [ symmetric ] ) , and contrast its behavior to that in a homogeneous network with @xmath70 and @xmath10 . for more general cases , we reported results for systems with only one of the three pairs being different ( i.e. , along certain 1-d subspaces ) @xcite . here , we extend our studies to certain 2-d subspaces , with two pairs of control parameters being distinct .",
    "though an overall understanding of the behavior of these networks remains beyond our grasp , we are able to gain some insight , through a mean - field treatment , into systems where one community is ` fully frustrated . '",
    "a good baseline study of an interacting two - network system is the symmetric case .",
    "specifically , we performed simulations mostly with @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 . before we proceed to the results , let us recapitulate , for comparison , what is known about a very similar system consisting of just one homogeneous network ( @xmath70 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "though we find an expected result  both systems displaying the same degree distribution , @xmath74 , we also discover a surprising one  drastically different behavior in @xmath2 .      for the homogeneous population in the steady state ,",
    "there is only one @xmath75 , since all links are connected to nodes in the same network .",
    "of all the distributions introduced above for two interacting networks , the most appropriate ones for this comparative study is the global distribution , @xmath76 , which should be same as @xmath77 for this symmetric case .",
    "as we found , these quantities settle down quite rapidly , so that we were able to exploit the relatively large systems ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) used in previous studies @xcite . starting with empty networks , we discard the first @xmath80/@xmath81 mcs for the single-/two - network model .",
    "thereafter , we measure the quantities of interest every @xmath82 mcs and compile the average over @xmath83 measurements .",
    "the resultant @xmath84 s are shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that there is no discernible difference between all three distributions , as might be expected .    , of a single network with @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( green squares ) , along with the theoretical prediction ( solid black line ) . for a system with two interacting networks ,",
    "the total degree distributions are @xmath87 ( blue diamonds ) and @xmath88 ( red triangles).,width=336 ]    for the reader s convenience , we recapitulate known properties of @xmath89 and how its form ( neither poisson nor gaussian ) can be understood @xcite .",
    "we see that @xmath90 is a double exponential , i.e. , a laplacian .",
    "our data indicate @xmath91 , which can be explained using a crude mean - field approximation to estimate the rates for our node to gain or lose a link . respectively , these are @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the heavyside function .",
    "the @xmath95 terms correspond to how a chosen node will act , while the @xmath96 accounts for how its partner nodes will act . in the steady state , each node is ` content ' on the average , and so , the probability to add / cut is just @xmath96 . balancing the gain",
    "/ lose probability currents , we arrive at @xmath97 which leads to @xmath98 , in excellent agreement with the data .",
    "needless to say , the same argument can be advanced for the _ symmetric _ two - network system , arriving at a similar result . however , as presented below , drastic differences between the single - network and the interacting networks emerge when we measure another quantity : @xmath2 .      in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we investigated this quantity briefly .",
    "in particular , we found that @xmath49 displays very large fluctuations and , for systems with @xmath78 , it takes very long times ( @xmath99 mcs ) for @xmath2 to reach the limits of its range . to build reliable histograms , it would take even longer to collect enough data .",
    "thus , we consider smaller systems for the remainder of this paper , namely , @xmath100 and @xmath10 .",
    "we also discard the initial @xmath101 mcs , to let the system reach steady state , before taking measurements every @xmath82 mcs for the next @xmath102 mcs . with the resultant time trace of @xmath103 points ,",
    "we compile a histogram , which leads to @xmath6 .",
    "we also construct a power spectrum .",
    "specifically , we divide the entire time trace into 20 shorter ( @xmath104 ) ones and obtain fourier transformations of each : @xmath105 where @xmath106(@xmath107 $ ] ) .",
    "the power spectrum , @xmath108 , is defined as the average @xmath109 over these 20 ft s .",
    "the results are plotted ( in red ) in figs .",
    "[ histogram ] and [ power ] .",
    "the presence of a broad plateau in @xmath6 motivates us to explore the dynamics of @xmath110 , to see if it simply performs an unbiased random walk within the confines of two ` soft walls . '",
    "this conjecture is confirmed by the latter plot , in which we see that @xmath108 indeed follows @xmath111 quite well , crossing over ( for small @xmath112 ) to a constant dictated by the limits of @xmath2 , namely , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "in stark contrast , the data displayed in green are indicative of very different behavior .",
    "let us emphasize what @xmath2 is  in this homogeneous population of @xmath115 nodes , all preferring degree @xmath116 .",
    "first , we randomly partition the system into 2 sets of 100 nodes , labelling one set ` blue ' and the other ` red . ' at any @xmath117 , the total number of ` red - blue ' links is defined as @xmath2 . clearly",
    ", if we focus on any one node , there can be up to 199 contacts , though @xmath0 will limit the average to about @xmath11 .",
    "thanks to homogeneity and the randomness in the dynamics , we can expect half of these to be cross - links .",
    "thus , we are not surprised by the peak of @xmath6 being located at @xmath118 .",
    "we can go further , to estimate the observed standard deviation ( @xmath119 ) by the following crude argument . denoting by @xmath120 the number of cross - links of any node",
    ", we already arrived at its mean , i.e. , @xmath121 .",
    "if we assume that the distribution of @xmath120 is a binomial distribution ( with probability 1/2 that the node acts on a cross - link ) , then this standard deviation is , roughly , @xmath122 . invoking the central limit theorem for 100 nodes , we easily find @xmath123 , in excellent agreement with observation . as for its dynamics , we expect @xmath7 to be governed by white noise , as confirmed by the green line in fig .",
    "[ power ] .",
    "by contrast , @xmath4 for the symmetric two - network system is over an order of magnitude larger : @xmath124 ! ( of course , by symmetry , the average @xmath3 is expected to be the similar , i.e. , @xmath125 . )",
    "the reason behind the failure of crude arguments for the symmetric , interacting two - network system is quite subtle .",
    "exploring this non - trivial issue will be the topic of the third paper in the series @xcite .",
    "there , we will study the opposite ( indeed , extreme ) limit of this system , thereby bringing the essence of this remarkable behavior into sharp focus .",
    "for the remainder of this paper , we will report on more systematic studies of @xmath2 in typical asymmetric two - network models .    : from a single , homogeneous network with @xmath70 , arbitrarily partitioned into two identical sections ( green ) , and from a model with two interacting networks with @xmath71 and @xmath126 ( red ) . in all cases , the preferred degree , @xmath127 , is @xmath116.,width=336 ]    , associated with @xmath49 for the two systems described in the caption of fig .",

    ", we will be unable to study details like the full @xmath6 or @xmath129 .",
    "instead , we will show results on just the mean , @xmath130 , and the standard deviation , @xmath4 . s . ] to orient the reader in this space , we start from the specific case above ( @xmath131 ) and first extend along the 1-d lines by varying just one of these pairs , but keeping their values equal . while is it fair to refer to , say , a system with @xmath132 as asymmetric ( since the individuals do not choose intra - community partners with the same probability as cross - links ) , the other two ` axes ' represent genuinely symmetric systems .",
    "those studies ( varying @xmath133 or @xmath16 alone ) should be regarded as explorations of the effects of population size and degree preference .",
    "in all these simulations , we again start with empty systems and carry out two independent runs , each @xmath101 mcs long .",
    "@xmath2 is measured once every @xmath82 mcs , so that , for each case , there are @xmath103 data points from which we compute the mean and standard deviation : @xmath134 , @xmath135 .",
    "we begin by varying @xmath136 , with @xmath133 and @xmath16 kept at @xmath82 and @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "recall that @xmath137 controls effectively the interaction between two networks , since individuals with larger @xmath13 are more likely to take action on cross - links .",
    "thus , @xmath138 represent two independent networks , while only cross - links are present in @xmath139 networks . for general @xmath13 ,",
    "however , it is not directly related to the value of @xmath2 ( but only to the likelihood for @xmath2 to change ) .",
    "therefore , our expectation is that changing @xmath13 would not affect @xmath134 or @xmath140 .",
    "[ diffs ] shows the simulation results for @xmath141 .",
    "our expectation is largely borne out , especially for @xmath4 .",
    "there appears to be a slight rising trend in @xmath134 , @xmath142 over this entire range of @xmath137 .",
    "it is difficult to explain these variations in detail , though the typical values deviate little from that in the symmetric case ( @xmath143 ) , as predicted above .",
    "we will next see that more interesting behavior appears when we vary the other two control parameters .",
    "the next pair we vary is @xmath144 , with fixed @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "[ diffk ] shows the simulation results for @xmath147 .",
    "needless to say , if @xmath12 exceeds the total population size , ( @xmath115 in simulations here ) , every link will be established quickly , and @xmath2 will be a constant @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "thus , our simulations sample essentially the entire range of meaningful @xmath0 s here .",
    "now , @xmath0 controls the preferred degree of a node and so , it is not surprising that @xmath150 . in particular , since @xmath151 is sharply peaked at @xmath16 , a simple minded estimate is that each node has @xmath152 cross - links .",
    "thus , we arrive at @xmath153 ( @xmath154 here ) , plotted as a solid line in fig .",
    "[ diffk ] and in surprisingly good agreement with the data .",
    "we are unable to find a similar estimate for the behavior of @xmath4 .",
    "the most striking features there are : ( i ) @xmath155 varies linearly with @xmath0 and ( ii ) @xmath4 is symmetric around its peaks at @xmath82 . that @xmath4 vanishes at both end points is clear , but it is unclear how other features arise . a phenomenological formula which accounts for these features",
    "is @xmath156 @xmath157 , but how it emerges from the underlying dynamics is unknown . in stark contrast , since this system is also ` symmetric , ' an argument similar to the above ( for its counterpart in a homogeneous population ) would provide @xmath158 , which clearly fails to match the data . understanding the properties of @xmath4 here remains a challenge .",
    "finally , we vary @xmath159 while holding @xmath160 and @xmath146 . due to limited computing power , we only explored an order of magnitude around @xmath82 : @xmath161 $ ] , the results of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ diffn ] .",
    "again , the dependence of the mean , @xmath134 , is easy to understand , namely , @xmath162 ( solid line ) .",
    "however , similar to the systems reported above , the behavior of @xmath4 is more intriguing . in an inset of fig .",
    "[ diffn](b ) , we show a log - log plot of @xmath4-@xmath163 and see that @xmath155 scales well as @xmath164 . such anomalous scaling hints at critical phenomena and deserves a thorough investigation . in particular , the incidence matrix associated with the two communities can be viewed as an @xmath165 ising model ( in the lattice gas language , with @xmath166 in the entries ) .",
    "then , @xmath2 maps into @xmath167 , with @xmath168 being the total magnetization , while the variance @xmath169 corresponds to the ising susceptibility ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "so , our findings here imply a _ decreasing _ ` susceptibility ' ( @xmath171 ) . this remarkable property can be argued qualitatively , as follow .",
    "note that @xmath172 controls the creation of a cross - link , so that any particular link occurs , roughly , with probability @xmath173 .",
    "thus , increasing @xmath163 while holding @xmath172 fixed corresponds to an increasingly stronger magnetic field , which in turn , leads to a decreasing magnetic susceptibility . in the next paper of this series @xcite ,",
    "such a mapping can be established analytically ( for the two - population model with maximally opposite preferences ) , while a system with @xmath174 can be interpreted as a peculiar critical point @xcite .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we explored the region around a special symmetric two - network system by varying one pair of parameters ( i.e. , along certain lines ) .",
    "here we turn our attention to a more general case , in which the networks differ by two parameters , specifically , just the sizes and the preferences . to make comparisons with the previously studied systems , we restrict ourselves to systems with fixed sums : @xmath67 , @xmath177 , and @xmath69 .",
    "moreover , from the results above ( especially fig .",
    "[ diffs ] ) , we see that the effects of changing @xmath13 are minimal .",
    "thus , we simply fix both @xmath13 s to @xmath178 .",
    "as we vary @xmath133 , over the entire range , we need to keep , say , only @xmath179 to access the whole subspace of interest .",
    "this choice allows us to refer to @xmath14 as the introverts and extroverts , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ general ] , we provide results for @xmath180 and @xmath4 as a function of @xmath181 , for three different pairs of @xmath182 .",
    "we choose ( @xmath183 ) , ( @xmath184 ) , and ( @xmath185 ) partly for convenience and partly for having @xmath186 s ratios at @xmath187 .",
    "focusing on the last pair first ( blue points ) , we note that both curves are symmetric around @xmath188 .",
    "since the simulations were performed for pairs of @xmath181 around 100 , the observed symmetry is an indication of the level of our statistical errors .",
    "the values of @xmath134 and @xmath189 at the center are entirely consistent with the findings shown above : approximately @xmath190 and @xmath191 respectively . away from the center",
    ", @xmath180 appears to decrease slowly at first , but turns up when @xmath181 reaches to @xmath192 of the boundaries .",
    "the slow decrease is related to @xmath193 , the maximum allowed value for @xmath2 . indeed , in this regime ,",
    "the fraction @xmath194 hovers around 13% , i.e. , @xmath195 divided by the average number of nodes in each community . on the other hand , the non - monotonic behavior can hardly be expected . in the next subsection",
    ", we will present an approximation scheme which can provide some insight into this remarkable phenomenon .    turning to the two asymmetric cases ,",
    "we are not surprised by the lack of symmetry in the curves . however , there are prominent and interesting features , the origins of which do not readily come to mind .",
    "first , the levels of @xmath134 are generally reduced , despite both @xmath13 s being held at 0.5 and the average preference remaining at 25 .",
    "specifically , for a wide range of @xmath196 , the @xmath197 s are relatively constant , matching roughly the ratio @xmath187 .",
    "thus , it appears that the introverts are controlling the level of cross - links .",
    "why the extroverts play a lesser role may be argued as follows : when the number of extroverts is well above @xmath198 , they can be ` content ' by maintaining more links to other extroverts , instead of adding cross - links",
    ". of course , it would be highly desirable to formulate an analytic and more convincing approximation scheme .",
    "second , in addition to the sharp upturn for @xmath199 , the peaks of @xmath200 are shifted to smaller @xmath181 , to approximately @xmath201 and @xmath202 for @xmath203 and @xmath204 respectively .",
    "these features can also be roughly argued .",
    "given that the preferred degrees are generally less than the number of nodes , it is understandable that the introverts are more likely to be frustrated , by the eagerness of extroverts to make cross - links . as we decrease @xmath181 , ( especially to values below @xmath205 ) we can expect such frustration to decrease , leading to the rise in @xmath134 observed .",
    "arguably , an ` optimal ' state might be characterized by a balance between the total number of cross - links the introverts prefer , @xmath206 , and that of the extroverts , @xmath207 .",
    "( note that we can ignore @xmath13 for this rough argument , since it affects predominantly the _ rate _ of actions on cross - links ) .",
    "this balance occurs at @xmath208 for our parameters , i.e. , @xmath201 and @xmath209 for the runs with black and red points , respectively .",
    "while such arguments produce a rough understanding of the data , more quantitative improvements are clearly needed .",
    "lastly , we turn to the fluctuations in the cross - links , characterized here by only the standard deviation @xmath4 , see fig .",
    "[ general](b ) .",
    "as pointed out above , these are far larger than naively expected and explaining their presence remains a challenge . here , we merely highlight what is in the figure : the asymmetric curves for @xmath210 , the variation by over an order of magnitude , and the ` calming influence of the more introverted . '",
    "the last of these comments refers to the almost constant @xmath4 for the @xmath203 case .",
    "we end this subsection with another observation . noting that the peaks of @xmath4 for the asymmetric @xmath0 s are also displaced toward the peaks of @xmath211",
    ", we plot a ` normalized standard deviation , ' @xmath212 , see inset in fig .",
    "[ general](b ) .",
    "it is interesting that the peaks here are now located much closer to the center ( though the curves remain asymmetric ) .",
    "perhaps a detailed analysis of this quantity will facilitate the formulation of a viable theory .      in this last subsection ,",
    "we present an approximation scheme which provides reasonably good agreement with data in a special regime .",
    "it is clear that , in a typical point in parameter space , there are so many competing features in our model that the contributions of all these factors will be difficult to untangle . a remarkable phenomenon  the upturn of @xmath211 as @xmath214 nears its upper bound in fig .",
    "[ general](a )  is observed .",
    "moreover , it appears that @xmath215 assumes the same value at @xmath216 for all three pairs of @xmath0 s !",
    "it behooves us , therefore , to explore this regime in more detail .",
    "the result , shown in fig .",
    "[ distinctx ] , hints at the existence of some underlying ` universal ' properties . focusing on this regime , we discover that a simplification emerges , allowing us to gain some insight into this universality .     of systems in the @xmath213 regime .",
    "the associated system parameters are @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 . for this parameter set , the regime with @xmath214 close to @xmath115 corresponds to the @xmath213 regime.,width=336 ]    in the regime of interest , introverts are seriously outnumbered and highly frustrated . in other words ,",
    "they find themselves with far more contacts than they prefer ( i.e. , @xmath220 ) , so that , when selected to act , they will always cut a link .",
    "a more precise and general characterization of this regime is @xmath221 .",
    "the result of this activity is that there are no ( or extremely few ) @xmath222-@xmath222 links in the system , so that we can attempt an approximation scheme for @xmath223 , the degree distribution of an @xmath222 .",
    ", we can drop the subscripts in @xmath224 , while @xmath225 is also identical to @xmath226 . ] from @xmath76 , the average @xmath227 can be computed . since",
    "every link is a cross - link , @xmath215 is just @xmath228 .",
    "the strategy here is the same as the one used for the single network : finding the steady state @xmath84 by balancing the rates for increasing and decreasing @xmath9 , namely , @xmath229=\\rho ^{ss}(k+1)w[k+1\\rightarrow k ] \\label{rhow}\\ ] ] where @xmath230 $ ] specifies the probability for a node with degree @xmath9 to become @xmath231 . to find the appropriate @xmath232 s here , we rely on the following argument . focus on a particular introvert , @xmath56 , with existing degree @xmath9 .",
    "for the regime of interest , we can assume @xmath233 , so that the only way for it to gain a link is for an extrovert ( not already connected to @xmath56 ) choosing to add a cross - link to it .",
    "several factors contribute to the rate for such a process :    * @xmath234 , the probability for an extrovert _ not _ connected to @xmath56 to be selected * @xmath235 , the probability that this extrovert will add a link * @xmath236 , the probability for it to add a cross - link ( @xmath96 here ) , and * @xmath237 , the probability that this cross - link is added to @xmath56 .",
    "now , in this regime , we believe the extroverts should be mostly ` content ' ( @xmath238 ) .",
    "this belief is supported by the observed degree distributions , a typical case shown as red points in fig .",
    "[ typicaldd](a ) .",
    "thus , we will approximate @xmath239 by @xmath96 .",
    "as for the last quantity , @xmath240 should be the number of introverts unconnected to our extrovert .",
    "we may estimate it by @xmath241 , where @xmath197 is the fraction of cross - links that are present . to be slightly more accurate , especially crucial for small @xmath205",
    ", we recognize that our extrovert is already connected to @xmath56 and so , we propose @xmath242putting the factors together , we have @xmath243=\\frac{n_{2}-k}{n}w_{2}^{+}\\chi _ { 2}p\\simeq \\frac{\\left ( n_{2}-k\\right ) /4n}{1+\\left ( n_{1}-1\\right ) \\left ( 1-f\\right ) } .\\]]on the other hand , the contributions to @xmath244 $ ] come from two processes .",
    "one is node @xmath56 being selected to cut a cross - link .",
    "the probability of selecting this particular node @xmath56 is @xmath245 , and with rate @xmath43 it will cut a link . but this action will be taken on a cross - link only with probability @xmath246 ( @xmath96 here ) . in the other process ,",
    "an extrovert connected to @xmath56 is chosen ( probability @xmath247 ) and cuts one of its cross - links ( probability @xmath248 ) . following the argument above for @xmath249",
    ", we have @xmath250of course , here @xmath237 corresponds to the probability that the extrovert _ cuts _ the cross - link to @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , we reach at @xmath251=\\frac{1}{2n}+\\frac{k+1}{n}w_{2}^{-}\\chi _ { 2}p\\simeq   \\frac{1}{2n}+\\frac{\\left ( k+1\\right ) /4n}{1+\\left ( n_{1}-1\\right ) f}.\\]]with explicit expressions for the @xmath232 s , we exploit eqn .",
    "( [ rhow ] ) to derive a recursion relation for the steady state degree distribution : @xmath252where @xmath253thus , @xmath254 is explicitly @xmath255where @xmath256 can be fixed by the normalization @xmath257 .",
    "so far , @xmath197 is not a known quantity .",
    "but it can determined self consistently , through the equations @xmath258the result is a _ prediction _ ( i.e. , no fitting parameters ) for @xmath259 and so , @xmath3 .",
    "plotted as black lines in figs .",
    "[ typicaldd ] and [ distinctx ] , these predictions agree remarkably well  provided we remain in the @xmath213 regime . clearly , the deviations of @xmath3 from the theoretical curve in fig .",
    "[ distinctx ] reflect the limits of this regime .",
    "finally , we return the issue of ` universality . '",
    "note that results eqns .",
    "( [ r],[rho - ans],[f ] ) are _ independent _ of the @xmath0 s .",
    "of course , their validity relies on the assumption that @xmath260 , which seems reasonable in these cases where all the introverts are highly frustrated .",
    "in figs .",
    "[ typicaldd](b ) , we show data for a more extreme system ( @xmath261 ) in which this notion of universality is indeed well borne out .",
    "an alternative perspective is that , in this regime , the @xmath262 block of the full @xmath263  adjacency matrix is frozen at zero , so that much of what we wish to compute can be gleaned from the smaller @xmath264 incidence matrix .",
    "as long as we restrict ourselves to considering ` zero @xmath265 blocks , ' the role of @xmath266 is entirely marginal .",
    "in this paper , we present further explorations of preferred degree networks and their interactions in a more systematic monte carlo study . specifically , we consider the effects of just one way of coupling the two networks , through @xmath13 , the probability that a node in one network adds or cuts a link to a partner in the other community .",
    "thus , @xmath138 corresponds to two completely decoupled networks , while a system with @xmath139 can be regarded as ` maximally coupled . ' even restricting ourselves to this simple interaction , we are faced with a large , 6-dimensional parameter space : the number of nodes in each network ( @xmath64 ) , their preferred degrees ( @xmath267 ) , and their couplings @xmath66 .",
    "we began with a study of the most symmetric system eqn .",
    "( [ symmetric ] ) , consisting of two _ identical _ networks coupled by @xmath268 . with limited computational resources , we ventured from this point onto several 1-d and 2-d subspaces . here , the preferred degrees are typically different and we chose the convention @xmath179 , referring to them as ` introverts ' and ` extroverts . '",
    "simulating these systems and letting them settle into steady states , we characterize them by measuring various degree distributions as well as the behavior of @xmath2 , the total number of cross - links between the communities .",
    "while some results are expected , other properties are quite surprising .",
    "one remarkable result is the drastically different behavior between two very similar systems , one being the completely symmetric two - network system eqn .",
    "( [ symmetric ] ) and the other being a single homogeneous network ( with the same total population ) partitioned into identical halves .",
    "in particular , defining @xmath2 for the homogeneous network as the links between these two halves , we find that its stationary distribution , @xmath6 , is well described by a gaussian distribution , with an easily predicted mean , @xmath215 , and standard deviation , @xmath4 .",
    "however , in simulations of the symmetric two - network system , @xmath6 displays a very broad and flat plateau .",
    "the standard deviation here is an order of magnitude larger and so far , understanding it remains a challenge .",
    "the different behaviors indicate that , despite its simplicity , this way of coupling two networks has a profound effect on the system .",
    "away from the symmetric systems , most features of the simulation results for @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be qualitatively understood , although a good theory will be needed to provide acceptable quantitative agreements .",
    "remarkably , within the regions we explored , we observed ` universal ' behavior in asymmetric systems when the introverts are far outnumbered , in the following sense .",
    "not only @xmath211 and @xmath4 , but also the full degree distribution for the introverts , become _ independent _ of the @xmath0 s . insight to this behavior can be found by noting that , in this regime , the introverts are so frustrated that their only action is cutting links . as a result ,",
    "there are no links between the introverts and the state of each can be specified by the number of cross - links alone . an approximation scheme for their degree distribution",
    "can be formulated , leading to very successful predictions .    these findings , though in a rather limited region of control parameter space ,",
    "reveal many non - trivial phenomena in a system with just two networks , coupled in a simple way .",
    "quantitative explanations of much of the data are still lacking . to make progress",
    ", we may extend the same approximation schemes to study the joint distributions @xmath269 .",
    "preliminary analysis indicates that , unlike the exact transition rates for the full , microscopic distribution , such a set of approximate rates obeys ` local ' detailed balance , i.e. , the only irreversible kolmogorov loops are those around the @xmath270 line .",
    "thus , it may be possible for @xmath271 to be found analytically .",
    "an in - depth study is underway .",
    "meanwhile , along the lines of our successful theory for the special regime here ( where the introverts are highly frustrated ) , we can consider the case in which both parties are ` maximally frustrated . ' with etreme ntroverts ( @xmath272 ) and xtroverts ( @xmath273 ) in our system",
    ", we coined it the ` xie model . ' within a short time , the intra - community links will be frozen ( empty and full , respectively ) while only the cross - links are dynamic .",
    "the @xmath274 adjacency matrix reduces fully to the @xmath264 incidence matrix and our problem simplifies considerably . even in this extreme case ,",
    "surprising behavior emerges , some of which has been reported @xcite .",
    "thanks to the restoration of detailed balance , we can solve the master equation and find the microscopic stationary distribution exactly @xcite .",
    "the next paper of this series @xcite will be devoted to more systematic simulations as well as more in - depth analytic studies .",
