    "understanding the origin of lenticular galaxies and how closely related they are to spiral galaxies is still a challenge for contemporary astrophysics . a wealth of evolutionary evidence links s0 galaxies to spirals .",
    "the morphology - density relation ( @xcite ) shows that while the number of spiral galaxies decreases towards the centre of a cluster , the number of s0 galaxies increases .",
    "it has also been shown that s0 galaxies are more common at the present epoch than at higher redshifts , while the inverse is true for spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanism responsible for transforming a spiral into an s0 galaxy has to stop star formation in the disk and enhance the spheroidal component ( @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , s0 galaxies are found in all environments , from high density clusters to the field , allowing for a variety of evolutionary paths ( gas stripping , strangulation , harassment , minor mergers , pestering , secular evolution ) and raising the question of whether s0 galaxies are a unique class , or a collection of objects whose formation mechanisms are environment dependent ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent work , moreover , suggests the possibility of creating s0s through major mergers under specific initial conditions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the past history of a galaxy is imprinted in its faint outer regions , where we can find signs of minor mergers , traces of accretion , or of a gentle passive fading . in general , it is difficult to study the kinematics and the stellar populations of early - type galaxies at large radii due to the absence of an undisturbed hi disk and the low surface brightness of the stellar component at large radii .",
    "recently , this last issue has been solved by using discrete kinematic tracers , which are detectable at large radii .",
    "large datasets are becoming available from globular clusters ( @xcite , @xcite ) , planetary nebulae ( pne ) ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) and integrated stellar light ( see eg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , gcs provide us with a unique tool for understanding the chemodynamical properties of their host galaxies .",
    "they tend to be old ( @xmath110gyrs ) and are the closest examples we have to simple stellar populations ( @xcite ) .",
    "gcs are ubiquitous across a range of galaxy types and luminosities , and can be studied up to distances of @xmath2100mpc ( see @xcite ) and beyond ( @xcite ) .",
    "they form a bimodal distribution in optical - colours that is often interpreted as evidence for metallicity bimodality ( @xcite ; for an alternative view see @xcite , @xcite )",
    ". in general , blue gcs tend to reside in the galaxy halo , while red globular clusters are associated with the metal rich stellar population , i.e. the overall stellar population in elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ) and the bulge or the thick disk of spiral galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "studying the properties of the gc sub - populations in lenticular galaxies can help constrain s0 formation histories .",
    "if s0 galaxies are gently quenched spiral galaxies , we expect their gc sub - populations to have the same properties as in spiral galaxies , only their specific frequency would be higher , since the total number of gcs would be the same in s0s and spirals , while spiral galaxies would be brighter ( @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , violent events , such as mergers or the accretion of small companions , would alter the initial distribution of gc in the galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite studied the red gc system in the lenticular galaxy ngc2768 , finding that the red gcs share the same properties as pne belonging to the spheroidal component of the galaxy .",
    "this suggests that , in this s0 , the red gcs behave as in spiral galaxies .",
    "however this work is based on only a colour selection of the gc sub - populations .    in an attempt to study the gc sub - populations in s0 galaxies to investigate their formation histories , we present a new method which uses the galaxy photometry and kinematics , as recovered from pne and integrated stellar light , to obtain the likelihood for each gc of belonging to the spheroid or the disk of a galaxy .",
    "this method ensures a physically meaningful separation , based on the kinematics rather than the colour , and allows us to trace streams and substructures .",
    "subsequently , we construct a chromo - dynamical model of the galaxy , where we correlate the gc probability of belonging to one of the galaxy components with its colour . our final goal is to understand the build up of the blue and the red gc sub - populations in light of the hierarchical merging framework of galaxy formation and shed light on the possibility of using gcs as probes of galaxy formation .",
    "in particular in this paper we study the lenticular galaxy ngc1023 .",
    "a number of studies have been carried out on this galaxy ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; and many others ) and it is an ideal case for testing this method . a new catalog of gc positions and velocities has been obtained for this work by the sluggs team ( see below ) and is published in this paper . the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the data we employ for our analysis .",
    "the method is presented in section 3 and the results are presented in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we discuss our findings in the context of galaxy evolution .",
    "summary and conclusion are presented in section 6 .",
    "in this paper we study three different types of kinematics tracers : pne , gcs and integrated stellar light . in particular , we test a new method where we use the galaxy kinematics as recovered using pne and stars to define a likelihood for a given gc to belong to the disk or the spheroid of the galaxy .",
    "all the data have been published previously with the exception of the gcs that are published here . in the present section",
    "we briefly describe the detection techniques and data reduction analysis of the three different datasets .",
    "fig.[fig : figure1 ] shows the spatial distribution of pne ( small , green , open circles ) , gcs ( large , magenta circles ) and integrated stellar light ( filled , orange squares ) over a dss image of ngc1023 , with the hst field - of - view outlined in black .",
    "note the large radial extent that such tracers cover , especially pne and gcs that reach out to @xmath3 disk scale length , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 arcsecs ( @xcite ) .",
    "east of the galaxy it is possible to see an excess of light at the location of the companion galaxy ngc1023a .",
    "we have adopted a distance for the galaxy of 11.1 mpc @xcite .",
    "gc data were acquired as part of the sages legacy unifying globulars and galaxies ( sluggs ) survey @xcite .",
    "gc candidates were identified in hst / acs imaging in @xmath6 and @xmath7 filters , as described in @xcite .",
    "the latter was supplemented with archival cfht data in @xmath6 and @xmath8 from @xcite to target gc candidates outside the hst footprint . for both datasets ,",
    "gc candidates were selected based on their location in the colour - magnitude diagram and , for hst imaging only , based on their partially resolved half - light radius @xmath9 .",
    "we adopt the classification of @xcite , for which gcs are fainter than @xmath10 mag in g - band and ultra compact dwarfs ( ucds ) are brighter than @xmath10 mag .",
    "the radius definitions to divide gcs from faint fuzzies ( ffs , @xcite ) are somewhat arbitrary , in this work we follow the definition of @xcite , for which ffs have @xmath11 pc and gcs have @xmath12 pc .",
    "the total number of gcs recovered using only photometry ( _ photometric gcs _ ) is 360 .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of a subsample of gc candidates was performed with the multi - object spectrograph keck / deimos .",
    "a total of four deimos masks were observed , see table [ tab : masks ] .",
    "two masks were aligned along the major axis of the galaxy , and two along the minor axis .",
    "priority was given to bright and partially - resolved gcs in hst , whereas remaining slits were assigned to un - resolved objects outside the hst field - of - view .",
    "the reader should see @xcite for a detailed description of the data reduction , while we summarise here the main points of the data analysis .",
    "we measure the redshift of the calcium triplet ( cat ) lines at 8498  , 8542  and 8662 .",
    "this was performed by cross - correlating eleven template spectra of galactic stars spanning a wide range of metallicities , with the actual gc spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig : figure1 ] shows that most of the confirmed gcs turned out to be inside the hst field - of - view .",
    "this is because the gc system of ngc  1023 is @xmath13 arcmin in diameter and it is elongated along the photometric major axis @xcite as confirmed by the paucity of gcs along the galaxy minor axis .",

    "we convert the cfht @xmath27 colours into hst @xmath28 colours by matching the objects in common between the two datasets .",

    "the @xmath28 gc colour distribution is bimodal , see figure [ fig : figure1tris ] , with a colour separation between blue and red gcs set at @xmath30 mag @xcite .",
    "the spectra for 115 candidates belonging to the ngc 1023 systems have been obtained and the velocities have been confirmed by two independent observers . for 96 of the 115 detections , which fall in the fields observed with hst",
    ", we have measured the effective radius , @xmath9 .",

    "the remaining 19 objects with cfht photometry are also classified as gcs , since they have a magnitude @xmath33 mag in g band and lie in the outskirts of the galaxy , while ffs are generally found close to the galaxy centre . in total",
    "we have 104 gcs , 63 blue and 41 red ( _ spectroscopic gcs _ ) .",
    "following @xcite we have assigned 6 gcs to the companion galaxy using the luminosity ratio between the two galaxies and requiring that the radial velocity of the object has a maximum difference with respect to the systemic velocity of ngc1023a of @xmath34 km / s .",
    "the companion galaxy gcs are 3 red and 3 blue .",
    "the integrated stellar light individual data points were presented in @xcite and the integrated stellar light data are taken from the kinemetry fits presented in foster et al .",
    "( 2015 , submitted ) , they were extracted using the skims technique ( @xcite ) .",
    "the method used to extract integrated kinematic information of the underlying galaxy starlight from a multi - slit spectrograph was first developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use the individual data points to assign a probability of belonging to the companion galaxy , following the same procedure as for pne and gcs .",
    "we find that 90 % of the observed stellar light is associated with the main galaxy .",
    "we use the binned kinemetry fits to compare the stellar kinematics with the kinematics of pne and gcs , see figure [ fig : figure3 ] .",
    "the pne catalog was obtained using the planetary nebulae spectrograph ( pns .",
    "it was published in @xcite and information on the data reduction and completeness correction can be found in @xcite : where 203 pne were detected , 20 of which are associated with the companion galaxy n1023a .",
    "the pne trace the galaxy light profile well , once corrected for incompleteness in the centre . when fitting with a tilted disk model",
    "the pne present a strange velocity profile , with decreasing rotation velocity and increasing values of the tangential components of the random motions ( @xcite ) .",
    "this was explained as a contamination of the disk kinematics by spheroid pne . when this effect is properly accounted for , by assigning a probability to each pn of belonging to the spheroid or the disk ,",
    "the derived kinematic presents a spiral - like behaviour , with a flat rotation curve and decreasing dispersion velocity in the disk .",
    "the colours of gcs are believed to be connected to the galaxy formation history .",
    "one scenario ( @xcite ) has blue , metal - poor gcs formed during the collapse of the protogalactic cloud and associated to the galaxy halo .",
    "red , metal - rich , gcs on the other hand might have been formed during a starburst that created the galaxy spheroid .",
    "alternatively , @xcite suggest that red gcs might have formed in super star - forming clumps at @xmath0 during the gas rich phase of galaxy evolution ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these clumps would have migrated toward the centre of the host galaxy , transporting gcs toward the proto - bulge .",
    "some of the gcs would have been stripped from the migrating clumps and become part of the newly born thick disk . both those sub - populations would be old ( @xmath35 gyrs ) . in this simple scenario",
    "we expect to find a correlation between colour and kinematics of gcs : i.e. red gcs should share the same kinematics as spheroid or thick disk stars ( @xcite ) and blue gcs would trace the halo kinematics . traditionally , this analysis has been performed dividing gcs according to their colour and then studying their kinematics ( @xcite ) . in section [ sec : analysis1 ] we reproduce such an analysis . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe the galaxy model obtained from pne and integrated stellar light . in section [ sec : analysis2 ] we present a new method that , instead , uses the gc kinematics to divide them into different sub - populations and then study their properties .",
    "this method assumes that the galaxy halo is an extension of the galaxy bulge .",
    "we call the bulge + halo components the galaxy spheroid , i.e. the spherically symmetric component dominated by random motion .",
    "this approximation could be relaxed when more data for the galaxy outskirts become available .",
    "gcs follow the total light profile very well , the disk dominates the galaxy light .",
    "there is no visible difference between the two gc sub - populations .",
    "gcs might have been destroyed toward the galaxy centre or not been observed due to the bright galaxy background , therefore their distribution might be incomplete in the centre . ]    as a first analysis , we compare the one - dimensional radial distribution of gcs with the galaxy starlight : if gcs follow the underlying stellar population , then , to within a normalisation factor , the two might be expected to show the same profile .",
    "figure [ fig : figure2 ] shows the comparison of the total , blue and red _ photometric gc _ number densities ( magenta , blue and red circles respectively ) against the total , spheroid , and disk surface brightness ( upper panel , middle panel , low panel , respectively ) , as modelled running galfit on an r - band image of the galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the recovered parameters are : disk total absolute magnitude @xmath36 mag , disk scale length @xmath37 arcsec , disk axis ratio @xmath38 and disk position angle @xmath39 degrees ; for the spheroid we estimated the total absolute magnitude to be @xmath40 mag , effective radius @xmath41 arcsec , sersic index @xmath42 , axis ratio @xmath43 , position angle @xmath44 .",
    "the spheroid over total light fraction is @xmath45 .",
    "the gc number density has been obtained by separating the objects belonging to the main galaxy , ngc1023 , from the objects associated to the companion galaxy , ngc1023a , using a light weighted probability ( @xcite ) .",
    "first , we bin the gcs of ngc1023 into elliptical annuli , going outward in radius , using the ellipticity obtained from a non parametric isophotal analysis of the r - band image of the galaxy .",
    "the total number of gcs in each bin is then divided by the bin area . in figure",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] , the gc total , red and blue number densities have been shifted in the y - axis to match the modelled surface brightness profile .",
    "the total model , black continuous line in the upper panel of figure [ fig : figure2 ] , describes well the light profile as obtained with an ellipse fitting ( black diamonds ) of the same r - band image .",
    "the total gc number density follows the total light profile , supporting the idea that they are associated with the galaxy .",
    "this galaxy light profile is dominated by the disk component and the gcs seem to follow the disk light profile . @xcite",
    "found that the distribution of red and blue gcs in this galaxy is elongated along the major axis , resembling the disk isophotes , supporting this result .",
    "nevertheless the spheroid profile would provide a good fit for the outer gcs , suggesting that red and blue gcs belong to both the galaxy components .",
    "a second clue comes from the study of the kinematics of the gc system as a whole , and of the blue and red sub - populations .",
    "figure [ fig : figure3 ] shows the gc two - dimensional smoothed velocity fields , using an adaptive gaussian kernel smoothing ( @xcite ) , for the total , red and blue sample ( left , middle , right panel , respectively ) .",
    "rotation with a maximum velocity of @xmath46 km / s , is clear in the total gc population as a whole , and for the red and the blue sub - populations separately .",
    "a similar result was found by @xcite , studying the gc system of the spiral galaxy ngc 2683 . the milky way red gcs also show large systemic rotation and were first associated with the old thick disk ( @xcite ) and then with the galactic bulge , due to the similarity of the net rotation of the innermost red gcs with that of the old field giant stars in the galactic bulge ( @xcite ) .            to compare the gc kinematics with those of the other tracers ,",
    "we obtain the rotation velocity by fitting an inclined disk model using a maximum likelihood method ( @xcite ) for pne and gcs , while the skims kinematics are obtained with kinemetry ( foster et al . , 2015 , _",
    "submitted _ ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : figure4 ] .",
    "all the tracers ( even when dividing gcs into the blue and red sub - populations ) have the unusual kinematic profile found by @xcite for pne , characterised by a decreasing rotation velocity and increasing random motions , in the outermost points ( i.e. beyond 140 arcsec ) .",
    "the agreement found in the spatial distribution and the kinematics of the three tracers suggests that we can use the stellar kinematics as recovered by integrated stellar light and pne to model the gc velocity field .      in section [ sec : analysis1 ] we showed that , when recovering the kinematics of n1023 using pne , gcs and integrated stellar light as tracers , the rotation velocity decreases at large radii , while the velocity dispersion increases . in a work based only on pne data , @xcite explained this behaviour as a result of contamination of the disk kinematics by pne belonging to the spheroidal component .",
    "@xcite also show that assuming a spheroid + disk kinematic model , the unusual behaviour of the kinematics vanishes and the galaxy presents a spiral - like velocity profile , with a flat rotation curve , decreasing random motion in the disk and a pressure supported spheroidal component . as a first test , we want to investigate whether , when a spheroid + disk model is applied , the skims data also present disk - like kinematics , as found for the pne . in the present section ,",
    "we give a brief summary of the method used to obtain the spheroid and disk kinematics for pne and integrated stellar light data , but we refer to @xcite for a more detailed explanation .",
    "a galaxy r - band image ( @xcite ) is decomposed into its spheroid and disk component using galfit ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pne and skims data are super - imposed on the image obtained by dividing the spheroid model by the total model , called f - map , and a probability @xmath47 ( from 0 to 1 ) is assigned to each tracer ; i.e. objects with @xmath48 would definitely be in the spheroid and object with @xmath49 would definitely be in the disk .",
    "we use a maximum likelihood method to estimate the best kinematics parameters ( i.e. rotation velocity and velocity dispersion in the disk , dispersion velocity in the spheroid ) , assuming a velocity distribution function which is the sum of the spheroid distribution function ( with zero mean rotation velocity ) and the disk distribution function .",
    "the assumption that the mean spheroid rotation is zero will be relaxed below .",
    "both distribution functions are assumed to be gaussian and the contribution of each one of them to the total distribution is given by the parameter @xmath47 .",
    "the fit is carried out in 4 radial bins for the pne and 3 radial bins for the skims data , with the same number of objects in each bin , always higher than 30 in order to assure a reliable fit .",
    "the fit is iterated several times , each time rejecting three - sigma outliers , i.e. objects with a likelihood lower than the _ likelihood clipping probability threshold _ , which is the value at which we cut the velocity distribution function ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fit rapidly converges rendering this process robust against a small amount of contamination . since the skims data are not point sources but slitlets",
    ", we have assumed that every slit is approximately described by a gaussian velocity distribution function and we have extracted 10 random realisations of every slit , in order to have 10 different mock catalogs , and carried out the analysis aforementioned on every catalog independently . in figure",
    "[ fig : figure5 ] , left panel , the orange dots represent the median of the recovered parameters and the error is given by their standard deviation .",
    "the pne kinematics are shown by green dots .",
    "error bars on the @xmath50-axis are 1 @xmath51 error bars for the recovered parameters .",
    "error bars on the @xmath52-axis show the size of the bin where the fit was performed .",
    "the kinematics of stars and pne is clearly similar .",
    "we can therefore unite the two data sets to obtain a catalog of more than 300 tracers and recover the galaxy kinematics with more precision .",
    "moreover , we estimate the rotation of the spheroid , see black circles with continuous error bars in the bottom , right panel of figure [ fig : figure5 ] .",
    "this estimate assumes that @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the rotation velocity of the galaxy spheroid and @xmath55 the spheroid ellipticity ( see figure 4.14 in @xcite ) .",
    "the galfit modelling shows that the spheroid in ngc1023 has an ellipticity of @xmath56 , which translates into a predicted value of @xmath57 .",
    "we also recover two components of the velocity dispersion @xmath58 , see second row of figure [ fig : figure5 ] , right panel ( we assume @xmath59 ) .",
    "the average ratio between rotation velocity and velocity dispersion in the azimuthal direction , in the two outermost bins , is @xmath60 .",
    "this value is lower than the one expected for a spiral galaxy ( @xcite ) suggesting that this s0 galaxy is not simply a faded spiral .",
    "following @xcite , this value of @xmath61 is consistent with this galaxy being involved in only very minor mergers in its past , see the discussion section for more details .",
    "gcs give us , therefore , a unique opportunity for verifying the various possible formation histories of s0 galaxies , in particular whether s0s are faded spirals or an independent class of galaxies .",
    "in fact , if the spiral galaxy has gone through a series of minor mergers that transformed it into an s0 galaxy , gcs may have been stripped from the accreted dwarf galaxies , which will pollute the chromo - dynamical relation found for spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , we would expect to find the majority of red gcs to be associated with the spheroid or thick disk and blue gcs with the galaxy halo , as found in spiral galaxies .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]",
    "having computed the likelihood for every gc of belonging to the model of the galaxy obtained combining photometric information from an r - band galaxy image and pne and skims kinematics , in this section we study the properties of the gc population and sub - populations .",
    "we have defined four different sub - populations : red and blue gcs , on one hand , and disk and spheroid gcs , on the other .",
    "it should be noted that in this preliminary study the spheroid may incorporate bulge and halo sub - populations with different properties . in section [ sec : kinecolor ] we investigate the relation between these four sub - populations and the galaxy as a whole . in section [ sec : rej ] we study all the kinematic tracers unlikely to belong to ngc1023 system and their connection with the companion galaxy , ngc1023a .",
    "to obtain a clearer picture of the correlation between gc colour and kinematics , we have to take into consideration the shape of the bi - modal colour distribution .",
    "in fact , the red and blue sub - populations overlap at intermediate colours , and our artificial colour cut at @xmath30 is an approximation .",
    "we fitted the two sub - populations with a gaussian function and estimated that the area in which the two sub - populations significantly overlap is @xmath62 and we exclude gcs with these colours from our analysis .",
    "as a first step , we calculate the total number of disk and spheroid gcs , simply summing up the probability for each one of them of being in the disk or in the spheroid .",
    "we find that out of the 32 red gcs , 19 are associated with the disk and 13 with the spheroid .",
    "while 18.6 blue gcs are associated with the disk and 25.4 with the spheroid . finally , 15 gcs are found to have a probability lower than 2.1 @xmath51 of belonging to the system .",
    "the majority of the rejected gcs have blue colours .",
    "looking at the trend of @xmath63 vs the ( g - z ) colour of the gcs , we realise that an extra parameter is needed to make this plot meaningful .",
    "figure [ fig : figure7 ] shows the distribution of the gcs ( associated with the system ) in a colour vs galactocentric distance plot , colour coded according to the probability of being in the spheroid @xmath63 .",
    "it is clear that the reddest gcs are concentrated in the centre of the galaxy and that they are associated with the galaxy disk .",
    "this fact is of particular interest since in this galaxy a population of ffs has been found to have rotational velocity similar to the stellar one ( @xcite ) .",
    "ffs are also shown in figure [ fig : figure7 ] as red open circles .",
    "they share the same position as the disk red gcs . for red gcs",
    "it seems that the reddest the gc the higher is its probability of belonging to the disk . for blue gcs ,",
    "instead , this probability seems to correlate with its distance from the galaxy centre , with gc at low radii having a higher probability of belonging to the disk .",
    "the method used in this paper to recover the galaxy kinematics allows us to identify outliers , i.e. objects that are not in equilibrium with ngc1023 disk + spheroid potential ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "some of the rejected gcs fall in an area of the galaxy where there are no data available to recover the kinematics .",
    "therefore we have extrapolated the galaxy kinematics in these outer regions from the outermost bin , for which we have pne and stellar kinematics .",
    "the outer parts of this galaxy are generally dominated by the spheroid component that we assume to represent the bulge + halo components of the galaxy .",
    "if this assumption is not correct these outliers could be halo gcs .",
    "on the other hand , they could be objects that are in the process of being accreted to the system .",
    "@xcite , in a study of the kinematics of the milky way satellites , shows that it is possible to quantify the time since they have started falling onto the mw using a 1-d phase space diagram .",
    "in such a diagram the infall time of an object is proportional to its distance from the galaxy systemic velocity .",

    "objects included in our model are shown as coloured symbols .",
    "the pne and integrated stellar light individual data points are shown as tiny green squares , gcs as small circles and ffs as large circles .",

    "figure [ fig : figure8 ] , right panel , shows the velocity vs distance along the major axis for all the objects , following the same symbols convention as in the left panel .",
    "the pne and stars follow a radial gradient in velocity , typical of rotating system .",
    "gcs and ffs follow the same distribution as pne .",
    "in particular , the gcs belonging to the disk ( open small circle ) lie in the external part of the distribution , i.e. they have a high velocity respect to the galaxy systemic velocity .",
    "the majority of the gcs associated with the galaxy spheroid ( filled small circle ) , instead , are located near the galaxy centre or along the minor axes .",
    "the rejected objects seem to form a coherent structure in the phase - space , connected with the companion galaxy , suggesting they may have been stripped from the companion while orbiting the main galaxy .",
    "three of the ucds are in the same locus as the companion galaxy and one belongs to the stream , suggesting a possible origin of the ucd connected with the interaction of the two galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "this result needs confirmation with more data .",
    "figure [ fig : figure8 ] support a scenario where the rejected gcs are part of a stream connecting ngc1023a with the main galaxy .",
    "this possibility can be fully confirmed when data to properly describe the galaxy halo will be available .",
    "in this paper we present a new catalog of spectroscopically confirmed gcs associated with the lenticular galaxy ngc1023 and its companion galaxy ngc1023a .",
    "we find that in this galaxy the gcs follow the total galaxy light profile and are therefore good tracers of the overall stellar population .",
    "their kinematics are also consistent with the stellar kinematics .",
    "we divide the gcs according to their colour , at @xmath30 , and find that the light profile and kinematics of both the red and blue sub - populations also resemble the stellar light profile and kinematics .    however , for both red and blue gcs",
    ", it is not clear from the comparison of the number density profiles with the decomposed disk and spheroid profiles whether the gcs better match either the disk or spheroid light profiles .",
    "we , therefore , develop a new method to associate gcs to the galaxy disk and spheroid on the basis of their position and velocities , using pne , integrated stellar light and an r - band image of the galaxy , to model the galaxy kinematics .",
    "we find that the majority of red gcs ( 19 ) have a high likelihood of belonging to the galaxy disk .",
    "the other ( 13 ) red gcs belong to the spheroid .",
    "interestingly ngc1023 has a sub - population of red ffs ( @xcite ) whose kinematics are indistinguishable from the stellar kinematics of the disk ( @xcite ) and whose azimuthal distribution is elongated along the galaxy major axis ( @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of blue gcs are spheroid - like objects ( 25.4 ) , but , surprisingly @xmath64 are found to be disk - like objects .",
    "the ratio between rotation velocity and velocity dispersion in the azimuthal direction in ngc1023 is @xmath60 .",
    "this value is lower than the one expected for spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) suggesting that this s0 galaxy is not simply a faded spiral .",
    "following @xcite , this value of @xmath61 is consistent with this galaxy having been involved in only very minor mergers in its past .",
    "an alternative explanation for our finding that @xmath65 is rather low in the disk of n1023 is provided by the possibility of forming the galaxy disk at high redshift through the merger of super star - forming clumps during the gas rich phase of galaxy evolution .",
    "@xcite , in fact , suggested that red gcs are born within ` turbulent and clumpy ' disks at @xmath66 , i.e. disks forming in a violent way . at @xmath67 , these disks ( when they survive )",
    "may look much hotter than the thin disks in spiral galaxies .",
    "clumpy disk formation , moreover , would leave imprints in the halo , as suggested by simulations from @xcite .",
    "halo objects could interact gravitationally with the giant clumps and acquire rotation in a dynamical friction timescale of 0.5gyr .",
    "the influence of the clumps would be limited to a region around the disk .",
    "this formation scenario explain the finding that red and blue gcs in the inner part of the galaxy have a disk - like kinematics .",
    "nevertheless , the galaxy is going through an interaction ( and maybe a minor merger ) at the present epoch with a companion galaxy , ngc1023a , visible inside the galaxy disk optical isophotes .",
    "this little companion may have been stripped of its gas , producing an extended and irregular hi distribution , displaced from the optical centre ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find that some of the gcs that are unlikely to be in equilibrium with the potential of ngc1023 are part of a stream , probably connected to the companion galaxy .",
    "blue ffs , moreover , are associated with the companion galaxy and the hi clumps ( @xcite ) .",
    "some of the gcs unlikely to belong to the model of the galaxy could be halo gcs that are not well represented by our simple model and are , therefore , rejected during the fitting .",
    "ngc1023 seems to have a population of gcs associated with its disk .",
    "in contrast , in the s0 galaxy ngc2768 red gcs share the same kinematics and density profile as spheroid stars ( @xcite ) , as found for the mw and the sombrero galaxy .",
    "this framework provides an interesting possibility for testing how a given galaxy disk formed : by seeing if there are associated red gcs .    as more gc data in spiral galaxies become available , together with the ages of s0 galaxy disk and spheroid , and pne kinematics of galaxy halos",
    "are obtained , the formation scenario for s0 galaxies will become clearer . for the moment , we find that gcs are powerful probes of galaxy evolution and that the red gcs in the two lenticular galaxies ngc1023 and ngc2768 are associated with different galaxy components , suggesting that s0 galaxies form through different pathways ( or that their progenitors formed through different pathways ) .",
    "in this paper we have published a new catalog of gcs and introduced a new method to associate gcs with different galactic components , given a kinematic model .",
    "this method also allows us to identify streams and can be applied to any discrete kinematic tracers .",
    "in particular we have used pne , stellar light and an r - band image to constrain the kinematic model of ngc1023 , decomposing it into its disk and spheroid components . following that we have studied its gc population .",
    "the main findings are :    * the gcs follow the stellar density profile and kinematics .",
    "* both red and blue gc sub - populations show rotation . *",
    "when decomposing the galaxy into its spheroid and disk component , we find that the majority of the red gcs show disk - like kinematics , the others are consistent with being in the spheroid .",
    "most of the blue gcs have a high likelihood to belong to the spheroid , but some of them show disk - like kinematics . *",
    "the gcs that are unlikely to belong to the galaxy model appear to be associated with a stellar stream , connected to the companion galaxy ngc  1023a , previously identified by @xcite using pne .",
    "we note that they could also be halo gcs that are not well represented by our simple model and are , therefore , rejected during the fitting .",
    "all these findings are consistent with this galaxy having been involved in at least one minor mergers , while its disk was created at high redshift from super - star - forming clumps . moreover , in the only other galaxy for which similar data are available , ngc2768 , the red gcs share the same kinematics and density profile as spheroid stars .",
    "this suggests that s0 galaxies are an heterogeneous class and that gcs are powerful probes of galaxy evolution .",
    "the newly developed method will be applied on a sample of lenticular galaxies to place stronger constraints in the galaxy - globular clusters assembly history .",
