    "this hampers severely a proper determination of the physical parameters of their discs and emphasizes the need for additional lines that are capable of tracing the disc properties at different distances from the star .    upon inspection of the feros spectra we found that all our b[e]sgs display strong line emission from the caii @xmath08498 , 8542 , 8662 infrared triplet .",

    "the double - peaked profiles of these lines , however , do not resemble those structures that refer to the formation within a rotating or equatorially outflowing medium as it seems to be the case for the forbidden lines .",

    "its wings extend for all objects to large velocities .",
    "these high velocities , however , do not reflect real kinematics but are most probably caused by electron scattering in a high - density wind or disc .",
    "the obvious diversity we see in the line profiles indicates that the formation regions for different lines must be physically .",
    "this allows us to draw some ( though preliminary ) conclusions about the possible disc kinematics and density structure of the sample stars .",
    "as was recently shown by @xcite , the [ oi ] @xmath15577 line arises from regions of much higher density and hence closer to the star than the [ oi ] @xmath06300 , 6364 lines .",

    "simultaneous modelling of the [ oi ] line profiles and line luminosities led to the conclusion that the disc around lha115-s65 is detached from the star and is in keplerian rotation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this detached disc or ring has a rather small outflow velocity which decreases with distance from the star .",
    "these findings are in strict contrast to the general belief that b[e]sg stars discs are the high - density equatorial outflow parts within the two - component wind scenario of @xcite .",
    "comparison of the [ oi ] line profiles for all our sample stars indicate that the @xmath15577 line is indeed almost always the broadest one suggesting that keplerian rotation rather than outflow might hold for all b[e]sg discs .",

    "current studies of the evolutionary link of b[e]sgs to other phases in massive star evolution indicate that they could be evolving back bluewards , which means that they are in a post - red supergiant ( post - rsg ) or post - yellow hypergiant ( post - yhg ) phase ( * ? ? ?",
    "* muratore et al . in preparation ) . applying keplerian rotation for the stellar mass obtained for such a scenario and given in table[tab : incl ] , we find that the velocity of 52kms@xmath11 corresponds to a distance of about 22@xmath21 and the velocity of 19kms@xmath11 to about 160@xmath21 .",
    "thus , most of the emission originates from the disc regions at roughly 160@xmath21 .",
    "if we assume that the disc has formed from stellar mass - loss , then its radial density structure has a @xmath22 distribution according to the law of mass conservation .",
    "consequently , the density increases by about a factor of @xmath23 over the [ caii ] emission region ( from the outer to the inner edge ) and becomes ( much ) higher than the critical density , meaning that we are in the high - density regime of the [ caii ] line formation .",
    "the rather large range in density might be one reason why the values of the [ caii ] flux ratios do not agree with either of the limiting values computed by @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that their values have been determined under the assumption that the material is ionized and free electrons are the dominant collision partners .",
    "such a scenario does not hold for the discs of the b[e]sgs . instead",
    ", the hydrogen ionization fractions were found to be very small within the [ oi ] line - forming regions ( but still delivering an electron density higher than the critical density for [ caii ] ) .",
    "the discs around b[e]sgs can thus be considered as being predominantely neutral in hydrogen @xcite .",
    "hence , collisions with hydrogen atoms certainly dominate over collisions with free electrons and need to be considered together with a proper radiation transfer in the lines of the infrared triplet .",
    "a proper modelling of the caii atom is beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "nevertheless , we may claim that the [ caii ] lines provide a new important and appropriate tracer for the structure and kinematics of b[e]sg stars discs .",
    "the mass of lha115-s65 used for the determination of the distance of and the density within the [ caii ] line - forming region was obtained considering that the star is evolving bluewards in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) .",
    "in such a scenario , it could have lost the mass that is now forming its disc during the passage through a rsg and/or yhg phase ( see fig.[fig : evol ] ) .",
    "so far , not much is known about the real evolutionary phase of b[e]sgs and several suggestions about their present stage can be found in the literature .",
    "for instance , it has been suggested that b[e]sgs are the results of massive binary mergers @xcite . as of",
    "now such a scenario seems to hold for only one object , the smc stars r4 .",
    "however , one should avoid to associate all b[e]sgs with stellar mergers , because the spectral characteristics of r4 , its position in the hrd just at the end of the main sequence , and its strong photometric variability , which is not common for b[e]sgs , displaces r4 from the rest of the b[e]sg sample .",
    "we therefore consider the merger scenario as the least likely common origin for the b[e ] phenomenon in the supergiant stars .",
    "some b[e]sgs were suggested to be evolutionary linked to luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) with which they share about the same region in the hrd ( see fig.[fig : evol ] ) .",
    "for instance , the star v39 in the low metallicity galaxy ic1613 was classified by @xcite as either a b[e]sg or an lbv candidate , and the b[e]sg star lha115-s65 was classified by @xcite as a pre - lbv .",
    "the lbvs are luminous objects ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "they were found to separate into two groups , and this separation happens at @xmath25 . while the more luminous lbvs were suggested to be post - main sequence stars evolving redwards , their lower luminosity counterparts are thought to evolve bluewards , i.e. , they are suggested to be post - rsgs or post - yhgs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also fig.[fig : evol ] ) .",
    "half of our objects certainly fall into this low - luminosity regime , while two others are just at the border , but could still fit to the same scenario because their location in the hrd indicates that they might have evolved from a 40 - 42@xmath26 progenitor star , which is about the limiting mass between the two evolutionary scenarios for lbvs described by @xcite .",
    "the possible classification of at least one of our sample b[e]sgs as a pre - lbv further suggests that the bluewards evolution in this low - luminosity regime could indeed go from the yhg over the b[e]sg to the lbv phase .    in recent investigations",
    "@xcite studied the dusty discs of the magellanic cloud b[e]sgs .",
    "they found convincing analogies to the discs around lower mass stars in a post - asymptotic giant branch phase , so they concluded that the b[e]sgs are most likely the more massive counterparts in a post - rsg ( or post - yhg ) phase . and",
    "further support for such a scenario comes from recent investigations of the @xmath27c footprint for the two least massive b[e]sgs in our sample ( lha120-s73 and lha120-s12 ) revealing that a post - yhg scenario is most likely for lha120-s73 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28c/@xmath27c ratio found for lha120-s12 was in agreement only with an evolved nature of the star .",
    "whether lha120-s12 could also be in a post - yhg phase needs to be tested based on predictions of the @xmath28c/@xmath27c ratio from evolutionary models for rotating stars at lmc metallicity extending to lower initial masses than provided by the current models of @xcite , but such models are not yet available .",

    "the density reached at that distance should be very similar for the [ caii ] line - forming region for all b[e]sgs . we can estimate these distances based on the disc mass fluxes that were determined by @xcite for all our sample stars but lha120-s111 .",
    "both the ratios of disc mass fluxes of the sample stars with respect to lha115-s65 and the resulting distances at which the required density is reached are given in table[tab : incl ] .",
    "with the obtained distances , inclination angles can be estimated from the measured peak - separations together with the assumption of a keplerian rotation law . to calculate keplerian rotation velocities",
    "the current stellar masses need to be known . in fig.[fig :",
    "evol ] we show the positions of our objects in the hrd together with evolutionary tracks from @xcite computed for rotating stars at lmc metallicity .",
    "the evolutionary tracks for smc metallicity do not differ substantially from those for the lmc , so we refrain from plotting both sets of tracks .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the b[e]sgs with @xmath88 might be in a post - yhg phase , while for the most luminous ones it is not clear whether they are evolving to the red or to the blue side of the hrd .",
    "assuming that b[e]sgs are evolving bluewards and interpolating available evolutionary tracks , we obtained zero - age main - sequence and current masses for all objects as listed in table[tab : incl ] .",
    "for the most massive stars in the sample we also list current masses obtained under the assumption that these stars might just have evolved off the main - sequence .",
    "the stellar radii have been obtained from the temperature and luminosity values given in table[tab : parameters ] .",
    "the line - of - sight velocities , @xmath34 , result from the peak - separations of the [ caii ] lines .",
    "if all stars were seen edge - on , these velocities would correspond to the keplerian velocities .",
    "to get an idea about maximum distances of the [ caii ] line - forming regions from the central stars we calculated the radial distances resulting from the peak - separation velocities .",
    "these values are listed in table[tab : incl ] in terms of stellar radii . obviously , these distances are quite large for those stars that are considered to be seen more or less pole - on like , e.g. , lha115-s18 .",
    "we computed the keplerian rotation velocities for all objects at the distance @xmath32([caii ] ) where the bulk of the [ caii ] line emission is thought to originate . from the ratio of the observed rotational velocity projected to the line - of - sight and the expected rotational velocity",
    ", we obtained a range in inclination angles .",
    "these values are included in table[tab : incl ] .",
    "good agreement with formerly suggested orientations is achieved for most objects . in particular ,",
    "the stars lha115-s18 and lha120-s73 are found to be @xmath7pole - on .    the inclination angle of lha120-s111 has not yet been determined .",
    "the position of this star in the hrd shows that it belongs to the most luminous objects .",
    "the masses estimated for both evolutionary scenarios can only be considered as rough estimates , and the missing value of its disc mass flux hampers a proper inclination determination .",
    "nevertheless , considering the mass ranges as listed in table[tab : incl ] , maximum distances of the [ caii ] line - forming region as obtained for a possible edge - on orientation are only slightly larger than the one obtained for lha115-s65 .",
    "the line strengths of the [ oi ] and [ caii ] lines are comparable to those of the other b[e]sgs , so that its disc mass flux should not be considerably smaller compared to lha115-s65 .",
    "hence , we might conclude that lha120-s111 could be oriented close to edge - on .",
    "the values obtained for the b[e]sgs at the border between low- and high - luminosity regime , lha120-s22 and lha120-s134 , differ significantly for the two different evolutionary scenarios ; while a close to edge - on orientation is obtained for the post - yhg scenario , an intermediate inclination angle is obtained for the redwards evolutionary scenario .    for lha120-s134",
    ", both results clearly disagree with the pole - on orientation ( see table[tab : parameters ] ) suggested by @xcite .",
    "the broad and clearly double - peaked line profiles of its [ caii ] lines definitely speak against a pole - on orientation ( see fig.[intermediate ] ) .",
    "which scenario will turn out to be the correct one needs further detailed investigation .",
    "the orientation of lha120-s22 in the redwards evolutionary scenario delivered a value of only @xmath89 . but this object has been reported to be viewed edge - on @xcite .",
    "this orientation has been confirmed by @xcite who discovered a reflection nebula in the vicinity of lha120-s22 that mirrors different viewing angles .",
    "interestingly , a ( close - to ) edge - on orientation is found in the post - yhg scenario .",
    "inspection of the line profiles of lha120-s22 reveals that this object has another peculiarity : both sets of forbidden lines are double - peaked and clearly asymmetric .",
    "but while the [ caii ] lines show a much stronger red peak , the [ oi ] lines display a stronger blue peak .",
    "considering that the [ caii ] lines are supposed to originate from distances closer to the star than the [ oi ] lines , this behaviour indicates the presence of inhomogeneities in the circumstellar material like a density wave in the disc or a spiral arm - like structure .",
    "such structures have recently been seen on images of the disc of a young stellar object .",
    "so , lha120-s22 might be the first b[e]sg star with spiral arms . in any case",
    ", it is worth to study both the kinematics of its circumstellar material and the time variability of the line profiles in more detail .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the inclination angles listed in table[tab : incl ] can only be considered as rough estimates , because several assumptions have been made for their derivation .",
    "the one with the highest uncertainty is the distance at which the [ caii ] line emission forms , because we implicitly adopt that the ionization fraction found for lha115-s65 is the same in all b[e]sg star discs .",
    "this must not be true .",
    "a higher value for the ionization fraction implies a higher electron density , and the distance at which the [ caii ] emission forms is shifted farther out . the keplerian rotation velocities are lower there and consequently the inclination of the disc would be larger .",
    "proper values for the ionization fractions in the discs of all b[e]sgs are therefore needed .",
    "this emphasizes the need of flux calibrated data for all the sample stars .",
    "we report on the discovery of the [ caii ] @xmath07291 , 7324 lines in high - resolution spectra of a sample of b[e ] supergiants .",
    "these lines originate from different regions than the already well - known disc tracers , the [ oi ] lines .",
    "the [ caii ] lines trace regions of higher density and thus must form closer to the star .",
    "combination of the kinematical information obtained from the line profiles of the [ oi ] and [ caii ] allows to suggest that the material around the b[e ] supergiants is in keplerian rotation .",
    "we estimated disc inclinations which are in reasonably good agreement with former guesses .",
    "however , the clearly asymmetric line profiles seen in the spectra of the star lha120-s22 indicate that the material is not in a disc or ring - like structure .",
    "we suggest this star might have a spiral arm seen edge - on .",
    "in addition , we discuss plausible evolutionary phases for the b[e]sgs .",
    "although perhaps for some individual b[e]sgs ( like r4 in the smc ) a different scenario might hold , a blueward evolution of ( most of ) the b[e]sgs seems to be likely . as suggested by @xcite and proven by @xcite and @xcite , the @xmath27c footprint is a powerful tool to determine the evolutionary phase of b[e]sgs .",
    "hence reliable data of the @xmath27c footprint for all b[e]sgs are needed , and we recently started an observational campaign to study the @xmath27c enrichment in the discs of all b[e]sgs .",
    "results from these observations will certainly provide a better basis for a more detailed discussion about the evolutionary phase of b[e]sgs and their possible links to other evolved phases of massive star evolution .",
