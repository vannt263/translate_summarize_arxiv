    "in the local universe , a strong environmental dependence of galaxy properties is observed ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is understood that external effects from their surrounding environments , namely galaxy - galaxy merger , harassment , ram - pressure stripping , and starvation may play key roles in sufficiently mature structures like clusters of galaxies in the nearby universe . at high redshift , on the other hand , the intrinsic environmental effects , such as galaxy formation bias @xcite should also play an important role rather than the external effects .",
    "the high density regions at high redshift are dominated by star - forming galaxies as galaxy formation preferentially occurs in dense environments at such epochs , which is naturally expected in the hierarchical structure formation theories .",
    "observations of high-@xmath0 protoclusters are important in order to study how such intrinsic environmental effects work on the galaxies in the early universe .",
    "so far the narrow band method has been very efficient to discover density excesses at high redshift .",
    "many authors have searched and discovered overdense structures traced by ly@xmath4 emitters ( laes ) since the late 1990s ( e.g. , _ z _ @xmath9 2 : @xcite , _ z _ @xmath9 3 : @xcite , _ z _ @xmath9 4 : @xcite , _ z _ @xmath9 5 : @xcite , _ z _ @xmath9 6 : @xcite ) .",
    "laes are thought to be less massive , metal - poor , young and star - forming galaxies in general @xcite although it is reported recently that their properties may change along redshift @xcite .",
    "@xcite repoted the typical physical quantities of laes at z = 3 - 4 : m@xmath10 m@xmath11 , sfr = 1 - 100 m@xmath11 @xmath12 , ages = @xmath13 - @xmath14 yr , e(b - v ) @xmath15 0.2 .",
    "such a galaxy population at high redshift is considered to trace the large scale structure @xcite , and at least some fraction of them should be the building - blocks that evolve to massive galaxies at the later epochs .",
    "the distributions of ly@xmath4 emitters in the field around the radio galaxy at @xmath0 = 2.39 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( hereafter , the 53w002 field ) , which is the region we study in this paper , was first investigated by @xcite .",
    "they conducted deep medium - band ( @xmath18 = 150  ) imaging of the 53w002 field using _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_/wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) . in their relatively small survey area ( @xmath9 2.5@xmath2 @xmath3 2.5@xmath2 ) ,",
    "18 laes at _ z _ @xmath9 2.4 were discovered , which was claimed to be the first direct detection of so - called ` building - blocks ' of galaxies at high redshift .",
    "@xcite also observed three other wfpc2 fields using the same medium - band filter and argued that the 53w002 field is a high density region .",
    "@xcite then surveyed the wider area around with the 4 m mayall telescope of kitt peak national observatory .",
    "they found 14 laes in the area of 14@xmath2 @xmath3 14@xmath2 and suggested that the laes in the 53w002 field showed density excess compared with those in the blank fields . while several authors have investigated the properties of the galaxies in this field @xcite , the previous observations seem to be insufficient to establish the significance of the density enhancement of the field .",
    "first , the medium - band filters used to detect ly@xmath4 emission line in the previous observations covers the relatively wide redshift range of @xmath19 = 0.12 ( @xmath0 = 2.30 - 2.42 ) , which may suffer from some projection effects .",
    "second , both deep and wide observations are essential to identify the high redshift overdense region while the previous observations are not sufficient either in area ( @xmath20 observation ) or in depth ( ground - based observation ) . + it is important not only to detect the high density regions at high redshift but also to characterize their richness in order to trace the evolution of galaxies in such dense environments or to compare the properties of the galaxies in their appropriate descendants . it is needed to introduce some objective measure to characterize such high - density overdense regions selected by laes to make the ancestors / descendants comparison possible .",
    "+ in this paper , we present the results of our deep and wide observations using the narrow - band filter .",

    "in this section we are going to discuss how significant 53w002f - hdr is .",
    "we should apply a more objective indicator of the significance of the structure than just density so that we can also make comparison with proto - cluster regions at other redshift and to trace the evolution of galaxies in such dense environment .",

    "first we made the theoretical mass pdf at _ z _ = 2.4 with @xmath96 = 10.5 mpc , this scale corresponds to the radius of a sphere having the equivalent volume with 53w002f - hdr in comoving scale .",

    "this is consistent with the results in the 53w002 field , and it may be the general property of laes .",
    "we expected that the external environmental effects such as ram pressure , tidal stripping , harassment and so on ( which work in timescales of @xmath9 a few gyr in typical clusters ) are not effective because laes are thought to be young galaxies ( typically have age @xmath9 10@xmath116 yr ) .",
    "the results revealed in this section suggest that the intrinsic environmental effects such as galaxy formation bias does not affect the properties of the ly@xmath4 emission of laes , at least at the scale of 10 mpc .",
    "it is also interesting that @xmath47 distribution of laes changes only along redshift .",
    "if the @xmath47 evolution along redshift is due to evolution of dust amount as claimed in the previous studies @xcite , there should also be environmental dependency since metal enrichment is expected to be proceeded more quickly in high density environment . so far there is no definitive answer for this question , but we consider that such environmental information is a key to understand the evolution of laes .      about the four labs in the 53w002 field we found that they have almost the same rareness probabilities : no.18 and no.19 have 7.7% , and 53w002 and lab4 have 10.2% .",

    "besides , only lab4 lives far outside 53w002f - hdr .",
    "it lies with a little offset from the local density peak as the other threes did , and possibly interacts with the two blobby laes located in the north of lab4 ( see figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "we speculate that the merger scenario may play a key role in the formation of labs , but it is needed to confirm the trend that labs have moderate small rareness probabilities using much larger samples in order to obtain the conclusion .",
    "we conducted the deep and wide - field imaging of the 53w002 field .",

    "<S> we present the results of our wide - field narrow band imaging of the field around the radio galaxy at @xmath0 = 2.390 with subaru / suprime - cam . </S>",

    "<S> the entire lae population in the 53w002 field has an average number density and distributions of equivalent width and size that are similar to those of other fields at @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a significant high density region ( 53w002f - hdr ) that spreads over @xmath7 near 53w002 where the lae number density is nearly four times as large as the average of the entire field . using the probability distribution function of density fluctuation , </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the rareness probability of the 53w002f - hdr to be 0.9@xmath8% , which corresponds to a moderately rich structure . </S>",
    "<S> no notable environmental dependency at the comoving scale of 10 mpc is found for the distributions of the ly@xmath4 equivalent width and luminosity in the field . </S>",
    "<S> we also detected 4 ly@xmath4 blobs ( labs ) , one of which is newly discovered . </S>",
    "<S> they are all found to be located in the rims of high density regions . </S>",
    "<S> the biased location and unique morphologies in ly@xmath4 suggest that galaxy interaction play a key role in their formation . </S>"
