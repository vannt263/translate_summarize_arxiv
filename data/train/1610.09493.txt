    "positron emission tomography ( pet ) is a nuclear imaging technique used to monitor metabolic activity of the body .",
    "the pet system detects gamma rays generated when electrons collide with positrons emitted by radiolabelled biologically active molecules , such as fluorodeoxyglucose . in oncology , pet is widely used in diagnostics of cancer metastases , in monitoring of progress in course of the cancer treatment , and also in planning radioterapheutic interventions . in the last case , pet scans , often in combination with computer tomography ( ct ) scans ,",
    "are used to delineate biologically active parts of tumors , which are then treated with ionizing radiation .",
    "accurate delineation of the tumor is crucial for delivering appropriate radiation dose and minimizing adverse side - effects of the therapy .",
    "however , the problem is not trivial as evidenced by substantial intra- and interobserver variations when delineation is performed manually by experts@xcite",
    ". therefore it is not surprising that automated methods for accurate and reproducible delineation are sought .",
    "in this piece of research we evaluated 3d implementations of spatial distance weighted fuzzy c - means ( sdwfcm ) of guo et al .",
    "@xcite , dictionary - based model ( dict ) of dahl and larser @xcite and convolutional neural network ( cnn ) @xcite , and compared them to classical approaches clustering approaches : k - means ( km ) @xcite and gaussian mixture models ( gmm ) @xcite .    in order to assure consistency of the input data ,",
    "images detected to be sharper than an arbitrary threshold ( after convolution with the 3d laplacian kernel ) were slightly blurred using the gaussian filter .",
    "the step was omitted in the gmm and cnn case . in order to clean resulting labels from small artifacts ,",
    "the labels were subject to subsequent morphological opening and closing , except the cnn method .",
    "we used @xmath0 implementations of km and gmm methods .",
    "the method is a spatial information - aware extension of the fuzzy c - means clustering algorithm ( fcm ) @xcite .",
    "both methods assign to each point a coefficient of belonging to one of @xmath1 clusters .",
    "similarly to fcm , sdwfcm starts by calculating cluster centers and euclidean distances based on regular features ( such as image intensity ) .",
    "however , in the next step the distance matrix is modified with weight based on spatial distance of each pixel to the cluster center .",
    "then , coefficients of belonging are calculated based on the modified distance matrix .",
    "the procedure repeats until convergence or maximum runtime .",
    "finally the tumor label is assigned to @xmath2 most intense clusters .",
    "parameters for the sdwfcm algorithm ( as well as for km and gmm ) were optimized for the training set ( see tabl .",
    "[ results ] and ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the general idea of the method is to assign each patch of the test image , the label which corresponds to the most similar patch in the dictionary .",
    "the dictionary , which consists of a set of patch - label pairs is built in two steps .",
    "first , a sample of training patches is used to seed the dictionary .",
    "based on the label similarity threshold , similar patches are clustered and averaged . then , a version of the vector quantization technique is used to adjust the dictionary patches such that real labels of its matches are as close to binarized dictionary labels ( also adjusted in the training ) .",
    "finally , the labeling algorithm assigns binary labels of the most similar dictionary patch . in our implementation",
    ", the labeling window walks pixel by pixel and each pixel gets the label of the best fitting patch or an average label , which is then binarized using the final labeling threshold @xmath3 .",
    "dict was set up with the following parameters : 3x3x3 patches were utilized , 10% of the training patches were used to seed the dictionary using similarity threshold 0.5 ; all training patches were used for adjusting the dictionary in 10 iterations with the step coefficient @xmath4 0.05 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "deep convolutional neural networks have proved to be one of the most efficient tools in image processing . for the tumor delineation problem we tested many cnn architectures consisting of up to dozen layers , including three or four convolutional layers .",
    "the input of the network was a batch of 2d or 3d patches from the pet tumor images .",
    "the network was trained using the adagrad stochastic gradient descent algorithm @xcite , which aimed at minimizing the euclidean distance between the output of the final layer of the network and the ground truth . to account for a relatively small number of training samples , the set of available data",
    "was artificially augmented with rotationally transformed samples .",
    "the best architecture , selected in the 5-fold cross - validation process , was the 3d convolutional neural network with 3 convolutional layers followed by relu activations with ascending number of filters ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "[ figcnn ]    , activ @xmath5 - activation layer with function @xmath5.,width=432 ]",
    "the training dataset provided by organizers of the petseg challenge consisted of 4 scans from 3 clinical samples , 9 scans from 3 phantoms and 6 simulated scans in 2 sets .",
    "we assessed efficiency of the methods on the training set in terms of the dice coefficient . as the scores were calculated on the training set , they are rather upper estimates of the real performance of the methods .",

    "the remaining methods performed slightly worse than cnn and similarly to each other ( dice score mean : 0.82 - 0.83 , median : 0.81 - 0.83 ) . in general , simulated data proved to be the easiest ( mean dice score 0.88 - 0.91 ) , while clinical data were the hardest ( mean dice score 0.76 - 0.78 ) , regardless the method . a single most difficult case was _",
    "clinical_1 _ for which none of the algorithms exceeded dice score of 0.69 .",
    "it is of note , that the gaussian blurring had a positive impact on segmentation of this case .",
    "clinical_1 , clinical_3 _ and _ phantom_2.1 _ were the only cases where cnn did not reach dice score of 0.80 .",
    "interestingly , cnn was always better than other methods for phantom data , with average margin over the second best result of almost 7% .",
    "looking more into details , cnn and dict achieved the highest sensitivity ( 0.89 and 0.85 , respectively ) , while sdwfcm achieved the highest precision ( 0.85 ) . in accordance with these results ,",
    "cnn and dict were more prone to overestimate the total volume of the tumor ( on average by 10% ) , while sdwfcm lined towards underestimated volumes ( on average by 3% ) .",
    "all methods overestimated the volume of _",
    "( by 30 - 49% ) , _ phantom_2 _ ( 9 - 58% ) and _ phantom_3 _ ( 8 - 47% ) , while the volume of _",
    "clinical_3 _ was generally underestimated ( 12 - 26% ) .",
    "interestingly , while cnn was the method which overestimated the volume of clinical samples the most ( 22% ) , its volume predictions were closest to the ground truth for the phantoms ( + 9% ) .",
    "accordingly , the contour mean distance of cnn predictions was the worst for clinical samples ( 2.28 in comparison to 1.81 by dict ) , and the best for phantom samples ( 0.72 in comparison to 1.30 by dict ) .",
    "overally , our early results suggest that deep convolutional neural networks can enable a step forward also in the pet image segmentation .",
    "this claim should be further validated with more testing , especially on clinical samples , for which performance gain using cnn was less impressive than for phantom data .",
