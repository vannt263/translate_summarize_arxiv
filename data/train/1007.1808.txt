    "the conversion of mhd waves from one type to another has attracted much attention over many years .",

    "now , an `` alfvn resonance '' can also be interpreted as just an alfvn wave running along a particular field line ( or flux surface ) , and so can also be thought of as a result of mode conversion .",

    "selecting @xmath2 well above the region where @xmath45 is significant , equation ( [ varpar ] ) may be integrated exactly to determine the alfvnic flux at the top @xmath253 on each field line .",
    "curiously , this physical - space quantity depends algebraically on the fourier - space dilatation @xmath165 : @xmath254 it is peaked close to where @xmath255 is peaked , _",

    "letting @xmath261 confirms that indeed the energy entering and being consumed by the resonance at @xmath262 is exactly that converted to @xmath227 along that field line .",
    "the significance of equation ( [ ftop ] ) is that the alfvnic flux is made up of _ precisely _ the modal dilatation on the resonances ; at each point @xmath5 the flux comes solely from the mode which has its resonance there . and providing @xmath263 is smooth , then so is @xmath264 , despite @xmath207 being undefined at the resonance .",
    "this is a pretty insight .",
    "the analysis of mode transmission and absorption presented here for the simple case of a cold mhd plasma allows us to at last understand the commonalities and distinctions between mode conversion and resonant absorption theories .",
    "both the current model and the mode conversion models of and share the characteristic that there is an avoided crossing or near passage of two distinct branches of the dispersion relation somewhere in @xmath265-@xmath266 phase space , across which energy may tunnel . in the case of the analysis , an upward - travelling fast mhd wave with predominantly acoustic characteristics ( since the sound speed @xmath144 exceeds the alfvn speed @xmath267 in the solar interior ) is incident on a surface active region where @xmath268 and transmits to a slow ( but still predominantly acoustic ) wave in the region above ( @xmath269 ) .",
    "the field - guided sound wave then takes the energy away to be either deposited in higher layers or to reflect from an acoustic cutoff .    on the other hand ,",
    "the modal resonant absorption model discussed here provides no opportunity for energy to be removed from the interaction region .",
    "although a singular alfvn wave of sorts propagates along the @xmath2-directed field line at @xmath270 , there is no net alfvnic energy loss from any segment . instead",
    ", energy is being continually stored deeper and deeper in the singularity ( recall that it takes an infinite time for energy to actually reach @xmath50 ) , or in reality is thermalized there by non - ideal effects .",
    "in particular , we may now understand resonant absorption as something that occurs when there is transmission to a `` trapped '' mode .",
    "this consideration deserves some further elaboration as it can easily be misinterpreted in various ways .",
    "first , one may have the impression that the resonances are related to the `` closedness '' of the system which artificially traps the energy at a certain position .",
    "this is strikingly untrue .",
    "in fact , in the modal model of section [ sec : model ] the field lines are open and hence an alfvnic wave packet can propagate away in the @xmath2 direction , though with no net alfvnic loss , and yet a singularity still results .",
    "this brings us to the second possible misinterpretation , previously expressed by some authors @xcite , that the occurrence of resonances and the associated singularities is due to studying a too simple model ( see , for a slightly different slant on the , results ) .",
    "a well - known example is the case of horizontal magnetic field in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere ( _ e.g. _ , ) , where the linear wave equations reduce to a single second order ordinary differential equation with coefficient of the second derivative vanishing at alfvn and slow resonances thereby leading to classic resonant absorption .",
    "however , if the field is tilted only slightly , the equations become fourth order and the resonance is gone !",
    "the reason is that there has been mode conversion to a wave that can run upward along the field line to escape , whereas in the horizontal field case it has nowhere to go .",
    "this example , however , is misleading .",
    "the horizontal field case suffers the same shortcoming as our present model , _",
    "i.e. _ , the invariance along the field . the inclined field case seems to resolve that issue but at the cost of simplifying the model in another respect . in the case of an inclined field",
    "all field lines are alike and the propagation across the field is trivialised ( by fourier expansion ) .",
    "it is exactly this aspect that removes the resonances @xcite which are essentially associated with the non - trivial behaviour of solutions across the field .",
    "resonant absorption has indeed been studied in models including both variation along and across the field simultaneously ( _ e.g. _ , ) .",
    "based on these considerations it is clearly necessary to remove the invariance along field lines in order to progress further with our understanding .",
    "this is done in section [ bundle ] by synthesizing a discrete ray bundle from the previously calculated singular normal modes .",
    "the resulting ray is not only smooth in @xmath45 as expected , but also smooth in the displacement @xmath94 as constructed directly from @xmath45 .",
    "there is no sign in physical space of a local or even distributed energy build - up , and also the escaping alfvn wave is strikingly apparent .",
    "this alfvn wave excitation / conversion mediated by resonant absorption has been noted previously for kink waves in coronal loop models @xcite .",
    "so is it  resonant absorption as mode conversion \" ? or is it ",
    "mode conversion as resonant absorption \" ? it is both !",
    "we have fabricated a ( mode converting ) ray bundle from the ( resonant absorbing ) normal modes , but could just as well have constructed the normal modes from a collection of rays .",
    "the fundamental and inescapable conclusion therefore is that resonant absorption and mode conversion are indeed two aspects of the same process .",
    "the distinguishing characteristic is whether or not the system allows a _ net _ escape of energy from the absorbing region in physical space .",
    "if so , it is best understood in terms of mode conversion ; if not , then energy escapes in wavenumber space only , producing arbitrarily small scales ( or local non - ideal dissipation ) , and resonant absorption theory is the most natural description .",
