    "an attractive proposal concerning the first moments of the observable universe is that of chaotic inflation @xcite . at some initial epoch ,",
    "presumably the planck scale , the various scalar fields existing in nature are roughly homogeneous and dominate the energy density .",
    "their initial values are random , subject to the constraint that the energy density is at the planck scale . amongst them",
    "is the inflaton field @xmath3 , which is distinguished from the non - inflaton fields by the fact that the potential is relatively flat in its direction . before the inflaton field",
    "@xmath3 has had time to change much , the non - inflaton fields quickly settle down to their minimum at fixed @xmath3 , after which inflation occurs as @xmath3 rolls slowly down the potential .",
    "two possibilities exist concerning the minimum into which the non - inflaton fields fall .",
    "the simplest possibility is that it corresponds to the true vacuum ; that is , the non - inflaton fields have the same values as in the present universe .",
    "inflation then ends when the inflaton field starts to execute decaying oscillations around its own vacuum value , and the hot big bang ( ` reheating ' ) ensues when the vacuum value has been achieved and the decay products have thermalised .",
    "this is the usually considered case , which has been widely explored .",
    "the other possibility is that the minimum corresponds to a false vacuum , with non - zero energy density .",
    "this case may be called _ false vacuum inflation _ , and is the subject of the present paper .",
    "there are two fundamentally different kinds of false vacuum inflation , according to whether the energy density is dominated by the false vacuum energy density or by the potential energy of the inflaton field .",
    "( for simplicity we discount for the moment the intermediate possibility that the two contributions are comparable , though it will be dealt with in the body of the paper . ) in all cases the false vacuum exists only when the value of the inflaton field is above some critical value .",
    "if the false vacuum energy dominates , a phase transition occurs promptly when the inflaton field falls below the critical value , causing the end of inflation and prompt reheating .",
    "the result is a new model of inflation which is dramatically different from the usual one , and at least as attractive .",
    "it was first studied by linde who termed it ` hybrid inflation ' , and it is the main focus of the present paper .",
    "the phase transition may be of either first or second order .",
    "a first - order model of false vacuum dominated inflation has been considered by linde @xcite and ( with minor differences but more thoroughly ) by adams and freese @xcite .",
    "a second - order model has been discussed by linde @xcite and explored in a preliminary way by liddle and lyth @xcite and by mollerach , matarrese and lucchin @xcite . as far as we know these are the only references in the literature to false vacuum dominated inflation with einstein gravity .",
    "related models have been considered at some length in the context of extended gravity theories @xcite ; although such theories can be recast as einstein gravity theories by a conformal transformation , the resulting potentials are of a different type and this case is excluded from the present paper .    the opposite case where the false vacuum energy is negligible ( inflaton domination ) is indistiguishable from the true vacuum case for couplings of order unity , though a variety of exotic effects can occur for small couplings .",
    "this case has been studied by several authors @xcite , and in the present paper it is treated fairly briefly .    from the viewpoint of cosmology , false vacuum",
    "dominated inflation differs from the usual true vacuum case in three important respects .    1 .",
    "the spectral index @xmath4 of the adiabatic density perturbation is typically very close to the scale invariant value 1 , and is in any case greater than 1 .",
    "this is in contrast with other working models of inflation , where one typically finds @xmath5 , viable models covering a range from perhaps @xmath6 up to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we shall however note that the extent to which @xmath4 can exceed unity is quite limited , contrary to claims in refs .  @xcite .",
    "topological defects generally form at the _ end _ of inflation , in accordance with the homotopy groups of the breaking of the false vacuum to degenerate states , provided that these groups exist",
    ". the defects may be of any type ( domain walls , gauge or global strings , gauge or global monopoles , textures or nontopological textures ) .",
    "3 .   reheating occurs promptly at the end of inflation . in the simple models that we have explored ,",
    "this means that the reheat temperature is at least @xmath1gev .",
    "one consequence is that a long lived gravitino must be either rather heavy ( @xmath8tev ) or extremely light , so as not to be overproduced @xcite .    false vacuum dominated inflation is also very different from the true vacuum case from the viewpoint of particle physics .",
    "sticking to the chaotic inflation scenario already described , let us consider as a specific example the inflationary potential @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the false vacuum energy density .",
    "consider first the true vacuum case , where @xmath10 vanishes .",
    "inflation occurs while @xmath3 rolls slowly towards zero , and it ends when @xmath3 begins to oscillate , which occurs when @xmath3 is of order the planck mass . in order to have sufficiently small cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy , one needs @xmath11gev and @xmath12 , with one or conceivably both of these limits saturated if inflation is to actually generate the observed anisotropy ( and a primeval density perturbation leading to structure formation ) . to achieve the small @xmath13 in a natural way one should invoke supersymmetry .",
    "as long as one sticks to global supersymmetry this presents no problem , but there are sound particle physics reasons for invoking instead local supersymmetry , which is termed supergravity because it automatically includes gravity . in the context of supergravity ,",
    "the fact that @xmath3 is of order the planck mass during inflation is problematical , because in this regime it is difficult to arrange for a sufficiently flat potential .",
    "as will become clear , things are very different in the false vacuum case .",
    "one still needs to have @xmath13 very small , and will still therefore wish to implement inflation in the context of supergravity .",
    "but now @xmath3 is far below the planck scale during inflation ( after the observable universe leaves the horizon which is the cosmologically interesting era ) . as a result",
    "it becomes easier to construct a viable model of inflation , though the smallness of @xmath14 in relation to the inflationary hubble scale @xmath15 still presents a severe problem for generic supergravity theories .",
    "remarkably though , it turns out that among the class of supergravity models emerging from orbifold compactifications of superstring theory , one can find a large subset for which this problem disappears . as a toy model",
    ", we will see how things work out with a specific choice for the perturbative part of the superpotential .",
    "another crucial difference concerns the mass @xmath14 .",
    "in contrast with the true vacuum case , the cmb anisotropy does not determine @xmath14 in the vacuum dominated case , but rather determines @xmath10 as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "the value @xmath16gev that obtains in the true vacuum case is allowed as an upper limit , but @xmath14 can be almost arbitrarily small and it is natural to contemplate values down to at least the scale @xmath17gev",
    ". the value of @xmath14 chosen by nature might be accessible to observation because it determines the spectral index @xmath4 ; if @xmath14 is within an order of magnitude or so of its upper limit @xmath4 is appreciably higher than 1 , whereas if it is much lower @xmath4 is indistinguishable from 1 . in the superstring motivated models mentioned earlier , the first case probably obtains if the slope of the inflationary potential is dominated by one - loop corrections coming from the green - schwarz mechanism , in which case the value of @xmath4 is determined by the orbifold .",
    "this would open up the interesting possibility that observations of the cmb anisotropy and large scale structure provide a window on superstring physics .",
    "the opposite case @xmath18gev is also interesting .",
    "supersymmetric theories of particle physics typically contain several scalar fields with this mass .",
    "the corresponding false vacuum energy scale @xmath19gev also appears in particle physics , as that associated with peccei - quinn symmetry , a global @xmath20 symmetry which is perhaps the most promising explanation for the observed cp invariance of the strong interaction .",
    "this same symmetry provides the axion , which is one of the leading dark matter candidates , and the possibility that it might in addition provide the false vacuum for inflation is to say the least interesting .",
    "we explore this possibility in the context of global supersymmetry and find that it can easily be realised there .",
    "we have not gone on to explore it in the context of supergravity , but there seems to be no reason why it should not be realised within the context of the superstring derived models considered earlier .",
    "as will be clear from this introduction , the present work is expected to be of interest to a very wide audience , ranging from observational astronomers to superstring theorists . with this in mind we have tried to keep separate the part of the paper that discusses the phenomenology of the false vacuum inflation models , and the part that relates these models to particle physics .    the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ infl ] introduces the specific second - order model upon which most of our discussion shall be focussed .",
    "we analyse the inflationary dynamics and density perturbation constraints by a combination of analytic and numerical methods to delineate the observationally viable models .",
    "section [ top ] then takes our attention onto the formation of topological defects , which ( almost ) inevitably form at the end of inflation .",
    "their possible existence constrains the models , and there is the further opportunity of a reconciliation of structure - forming defects with inflation . in section [ sugr ]",
    "we try to realise the model in the contexts of global supersymmetry , supergravity and superstring derived supergravity .",
    "in section [ models ] we consider the related first - order model which also indicates the link with extended inflation models .",
    "section [ conc ] summarises the paper .",
    "throughout this paper we assume einstein gravity . during inflation",
    "the energy density is supposed to be dominated by the potential of two scalar fields , which is taken to be of the form @xmath21 this potential possesses the symmetries @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and is the most general renormalisable potential with this property except for a quartic term @xmath24 . ) .",
    "non - renormalisable potentials , involving higher powers of the fields , arise naturally in the context of supergravity , but for simplicity we ignore them here . as we discuss later the @xmath25 field can have several components , but they do not affect the issues we discuss in the present section . ]",
    "we make the restrictions @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and we also require that the masses @xmath14 and @xmath28 fall in the range between @xmath29gev and the planck scale @xmath30gev indicated by particle physics considerations .",
    "is mathematically convenient and we shall follow the majority of authors by inserting it , though of course our understanding of the planck scale is quite insufficient to justify such factors from a physical viewpoint . ]",
    "provided that @xmath31 , where @xmath32 there is a local minimum at @xmath33 on the constant @xmath3 slices , corresponding to a false vacuum .",
    "our assumption is that inflation occurs with the @xmath25 field sitting in this false vacuum , so that the potential is @xmath34 if the false vacuum dominates , inflation ends when @xmath3 falls below @xmath35 , the fields rapidly adjusting to their true vacuum values @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this model was first considered by kofman and linde @xcite , who pointed out that it might produce cosmic strings with enough energy per unit length to form structure .",
    "they considered only what we shall term the inflaton dominated regime ( small false vacuum energy ) , as did several subsequent authors studying this and related models @xcite . in order to obtain interesting effects",
    ", these authors had to assume ( at least ) that the coupling @xmath38 was many orders of magnitude less than unity .",
    "the case of false vacuum domination , which is our main focus , was proposed by linde who termed it ` hybrid inflation ' @xcite and has received further attention from liddle and lyth @xcite , linde @xcite , and mollerach , matarrese and lucchin @xcite . in this case",
    "the couplings can be of order unity , but for completeness we explore also the regime of parameter space where they are very different from one .      as usual",
    ", the inflationary dynamics are governed by the equations @xmath39 for two isotropic scalar fields in an expanding universe , with @xmath40 the hubble parameter , @xmath41 the scale factor , @xmath42 the planck mass and dots derivatives with respect to time .",
    "our assumption is that there is a transitory regime during which the @xmath25 field rolls to @xmath33 from whatever its initial value may have been , and is followed by sufficient inflation on the @xmath33 trajectory to erase any evidence of such a transient .",
    "inflation then proceeds according to the usual single field equation for @xmath3 in the potential of eq .",
    "( [ phipot ] ) . without loss of generality",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath3 is initially positive .",
    "we shall utilise the slow - roll approximation throughout .",
    "it is characterised by the conditions @xmath43 where the two dimensionless functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 are defined by @xmath46 here and throughout primes indicate derivatives with respect to the field @xmath3 . with justification from numerical results ,",
    "it is standard to assume that if the potential satisfies these conditions , then the solutions for a broad range of initial conditions rapidly approach the attractor @xmath47 when this is satisfied , there exists a simple expression for the number @xmath48 of @xmath49-foldings of expansion which occur between two scalar field values @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xmath52 for our specific potential we have @xmath53    within the slow - roll approximation , the condition for inflation to occur is simply that @xmath54 be less than one . however , slow - roll is automatically a poor approximation should @xmath54 reach this value , though the amount of inflation that occurs as @xmath54 becomes large is always small .",
    "numerical simulation indicates that for this potential if @xmath54 and @xmath55 grow to unity , shortly thereafter the inflationary condition @xmath56 is violated and inflation ends .",
    "the number of @xmath49-foldings that occur between these events is a tiny fraction of unity , and can be ignored .",
    "it is therefore sensible operationally to identify the end of inflation in this case with the precise condition that @xmath57 , should this occur , and we shall assume this subsequently .",
    "there are therefore two separate ways in which inflation may end in this model , the one which is applicable depending on the parameter values .",
    "these are    1 .",
    "if @xmath3 reaches @xmath35 while inflation is occurring , then inflation may end through the instability of the @xmath25 field to roll to its global minimum . as noted by linde @xcite one",
    "expects this to happen , at least for @xmath13 and @xmath38 not too small , if the false vacuum term @xmath58 dominates the potential .",
    "we look in some detail at this possibility in section [ top ] , confirming the picture of rapid instability .",
    "if the logarithmic slope of the potential becomes too large _ on the @xmath59 trajectory _ , then inflation can end while the @xmath3 field is still rolling down that trajectory .",
    "this is symptomised by @xmath54 growing to exceed unity . some time",
    "later , @xmath3 will pass @xmath35 and the @xmath25 field may roll away from @xmath59 .",
    "the value of @xmath3 at which @xmath54 becomes equal to unity is , where @xmath54 drops back below unity .",
    "however , for second - order models it is easy to show that the attractor solution eq .",
    "( [ attr ] ) can not be attained for @xmath3 below this root , allowing inflation to restart , before the instability sets in . ]",
    "@xmath60 if @xmath61 , then @xmath62 does not exist at all . in that case inflation",
    "must end by instability . in the opposite limit ,",
    "the position @xmath63 is familiar from chaotic inflation with a single field , and of course the standard results will be recovered in that limit with the @xmath25 field playing no significant role .",
    "we need to know the number @xmath64 of hubble times of inflation which occur after a given scale leaves the horizon leaves the horizon when @xmath65 . with the assumptions ( valid in our model )",
    "that @xmath15 does not vary significantly and that reheating is prompt it is given by @xcite @xmath66 where subscript ` 0 ' indicates present value .",
    "the largest cosmologically interesting scale is of order the present hubble distance ( roughly the size of the observable universe ) , @xmath67 , and other scales of cosmological interest leave the horizon at most a few hubble times after this one . as for the inflationary energy scale ,",
    "true vacuum inflation typically gives @xmath68gev , which makes the observable universe leave the horizon about 60 e - folds before the end of inflation ( the fact that reheating may be very inefficient in this model may reduce this number somewhat ) .",
    "as we shall see , false vacuum dominated inflation can give values as low as @xmath69gev , which reduces the figure 60 to about 50 .",
    "however , one only needs a rough estimate of @xmath48 for most purposes because the potential is slowly varying , and for simplicity we suppose from now on that cosmologically interesting scales leave the horizon 60 e - folds before the end of inflation .    provided the parameters",
    "are chosen in such a way as to produce the correct level of density perturbations to explain the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite observations @xcite of the cmb anisotropies , there is no problem in obtaining sufficient inflation to resolve the horizon and flatness problems or with ensuring that a classical description of the evolution is adequate .",
    "we thus need only investigate the density perturbation constraint in order to completely fix the model .",
    "the adiabatic density perturbation , which is generally thought to be responsible for large scale structure , originates as a vacuum fluctuation during inflation .",
    "its spectrum is determined by a quantity @xmath70 , which loosely speaking gives the density contrast at horizon crossing and is defined formally in @xcite .",
    "the inflationary prediction for the spectrum is @xmath71 where @xmath54 is the slow - roll parameter defined earlier and the subscript @xmath72 indicates that the right hand side is to be evaluated as the comoving scale @xmath73 equals the hubble radius ( @xmath74 ) during inflation .    by virtue of the slow - roll conditions eqs .",
    "( [ epssmall])-([attr ] ) , this formula gives a value of @xmath75 which is nearly independent of @xmath73 on scales of cosmological interest , in agreement with observation .",
    "for a sufficiently flat spectrum , and provided that no significant generation of long wavelength gravitational wave modes occurs , the central value of the cobe @xmath76 anisotropy , @xmath77 , is reproduced provided one has @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "thus the inflationary energy scale when cosmologically interesting scales leave the horizon is given by @xmath79 where a subscript 60 denotes 60 e - folds before the end of inflation .",
    "the most efficient way to proceed is as follows .",
    "first , fix the couplings @xmath13 and @xmath38 . then , having chosen a value for the mass scale @xmath28 , find the value(s ) of @xmath14 such that the density perturbation constraint is satisfied .",
    "assuming that inflation ends promptly if @xmath3 falls below @xmath80 , we can determine the means by which inflation ends and the corresponding value of @xmath3 @xmath81 we then use eq .",
    "( [ efold ] ) to determine the value of @xmath3 60 @xmath49-foldings from the end of inflation , @xmath82 , and evaluate @xmath70 as @xmath83 to find the value(s ) of @xmath14 which satisfy the cobe normalisation , remember that @xmath84 , and hence @xmath82 , is a function of @xmath14 . in general this procedure can not be carried out analytically , and we compute using an iterative numerical method . however , the problem can be solved analytically and self - consistently in two regimes .",
    "as we shall see , provided @xmath28 is not too large then for each @xmath28 there are _ two _ possible choices of @xmath14 which give the right perturbation amplitude .",
    "one corresponds to the traditional polynomial chaotic inflation scenario , where the first term in eq .",
    "( [ phipot ] ) plays a negligible role ( and by implication the first term in the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ delh ] ) likewise ) .",
    "[ there is a variant on this regime , also discussed below , where the instability sets in while the false vacuum energy is still negligible . ] the second , and for our purposes more interesting , possibility involves a value of @xmath85 , and corresponds to domination by the first term in eq .",

    "however , this formula depends crucially on the assumption that each fourier mode of @xmath3 is in the vacuum state before leaving the horizon , whereas the phase transition will inevitably populate some of the modes with non - zero particle number . taking this into account , the adiabatic perturbation on scales leaving the horizon after @xmath102 might be quite different ( non - gaussian , with a non - flat spectrum and a different normalisation ) .",
    "an additional adiabatic perturbation might also be generated by the perturbation in @xmath25 @xcite , as discussed in section 3.1 .",

    "in contrast with the inflaton dominated case , defect production has not previously been considered for the vacuum dominated regime .",

    "ideally one would like to follow the evolution of the fields using quantum field theory in curved spacetime , as in the inflaton dominated case , and hence calculate explicitly the typical spacing and other stochastic properties of the initial distribution of the defects .",

    "when @xmath3 is hit by the back - reaction from @xmath25 , it will acquire a spatial gradient of order @xmath218 , which will soon become much bigger than @xmath14 . as a result of the backreaction",
    ", @xmath3 will look more like a collection of interacting plane waves than a homogeneous field , and can not be said to ` roll down ' to its true vacuum .",
    "moreover , @xmath25 will in general still be an essentially quantum object at this stage ( i.  e.  the state of the system is not a superposition of states in which it has an almost well defined value over an extended period of time ) , so @xmath3 will become one as well .    in the absence of an explicit calculation",
    "one must rely on order of magnitude arguments , which as we now see actually point to rather definite conclusions .",

    "since at least the scale @xmath28 is much bigger than @xmath15 ( and even @xmath14 is not many orders of magnitude less ) , one expects the fields to thermalise quickly on the hubble timescale ; reheating in the vacuum dominated case will occur promptly at the end of inflation .",
    "the reheat temperature @xmath219 is therefore given by the familiar formula @xmath220 , or @xmath221 where @xmath222 is the effective number of degrees of freedom at that temperature , presumably at least of order @xmath223 ( e.  g.  in the minimal supersymmetric standard model @xmath224 ) .",

    "the defects that have been formed find themselves effectively in a thermal bath at a temperature @xmath225 , and may be in thermal equilibrium .",

    "for the case of cosmic strings , such a configuration , below the hagedorn transition consists of maximising the number of possible loops that can form , with the long strings being exponentially suppressed @xcite .",
    "since this distribution is similiar to that found soon after a thermal phase transition has produced strings , it is possible that the effect of such a rapid reheating could lead to a configuration of defects much the same as if there had been a thermal phase transition .",

    "local cosmic strings are perhaps the most interesting defect for cosmology",
    ". the primary motivation for employing them here would be so they could contribute as seeds for the observed large scale structure and the anisotropies in the microwave background .",

    "therefore we must reassess the estimates of the allowed model parameters determined in the previous section , for these were obtained assuming that the inflaton field alone was responsible for the cmb anisotropies . with two sources ( assumed uncorrelated ) of anisotropies , the contributions add in quadrature .",
    "as a benchmark figure we reduce the inflation contribution to 10% of the total anisotropy , corresponding to dropping @xmath70 by @xmath226 .",
    "numerical calculation shows that for unit couplings , this only reduces @xmath227 from @xmath228 to @xmath229 .",
    "recent simulations of cosmic string networks has shown the importance of the small scale structure on the network .",
    "an important effect of this structure is to renormalise the string mass per unit length @xmath230 , relating it to the original mass per unit length @xmath231 by @xmath232 @xcite . recalling that @xmath233 ( provided scalar and vector masses are not too disparate ) , we are therefore allowed a mass per unit length of up to @xmath234 , which is comfortably high enough to allow @xmath230 to fall in the favoured range of values for structure formation @xmath235 @xcite .",
    "an equivalent calculation indicates that global textures can be similarly reconciled , though more marginally . indeed , for the highest values we can obtain , the strings would create excessive microwave fluctuations ; the best current bound on @xmath230 arises from cmb anisotropies on scales less than 10 , and yields @xmath236 @xcite .",

    "( [ phipot ] ) , and the dynamics are the same as considered in section [ infl ] , except that the effective mass of the @xmath25 field is now @xmath468 and a second - order transition is not possible for @xmath469 . instead the transition must proceed by nucleating bubbles of the true vacuum and the end - point @xmath80 is replaced by the critical value @xmath470 where the percolation parameter reaches @xmath471 .",
    "notice then that inflation ends at @xmath472 where the slow - roll condition may break down at @xmath62 ( defined as in section [ infl ] ) before the true vacuum percolates .",
    "if this is the case then we are again in the inflaton dominated limit , the false vacuum energy density is negligible ( @xmath473 ) and the constraints are exactly the same as when the eventual transition to true vacuum is second - order .",
    "the precise mechanism of the phase transition becomes irrelevant as this now occurs after inflation has ended . after passing @xmath62",
    "the field reaches @xmath37 within one hubble time . unlike the second - order model",
    "this does not immediately cause an instability , and oscillations about @xmath37 could be sufficiently damped to restart inflation if @xmath470 lies very close to zero .",
    "however even in this case we can show that the number of @xmath49-foldings , given by eq .",
    "( [ efold ] ) , during any subsequent stage of inflation @xmath474 must be very small .    thus we will consider only the vacuum dominated branch in what follows , where we may take @xmath475",
    ". another reason for doing this is that we will have to ignore the evolution of the @xmath3 field while calculating the nucleation rate for @xmath25 from the false to the true vacuum .",
    "the correct two ",
    "field result is not known so , in common with all other models of first ",
    "order inflation , we will calculate instead the tunnelling rate for the quasi ",
    "static potential @xmath476 .",
    "we would only expect this to be valid if @xmath477 , which is indeed guaranteed if we are in the vacuum dominated regime .",
    "the percolation parameter is then given by @xmath478 where the term in the exponential is the euclidean action of the tunnelling configuration @xcite , recently given for first - order quartic potentials @xmath476 by adams @xcite as @xmath479 , with @xmath480 a numerically calculated monotonically increasing fitting function of the parameter @xmath481    in our model @xmath482 decreases as @xmath3 rolls down its potential during inflation , until @xmath483 is sufficiently small for the percolation parameter to reach unity allowing the first - order transition to complete .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath484 figure 3 shows the corresponding value of @xmath485 required for the transition to complete at different values of the false vacuum energy density . clearly for a given @xmath374",
    "there is a lower bound , @xmath486 , and a corresponding bound on the nucleation rate , so the first - order transition can not complete when the energy density of the false vacuum is above a given value .",
    "for instance , if @xmath487 , and @xmath488 then the transition will never complete for @xmath489gev .",
    "assuming then that @xmath374 is sufficiently small ( i.  e.  @xmath490 ) , bubbles of the true vacuum will percolate at @xmath491 , where , to utilise the results of section [ infl ] , we write @xmath492 to complicate the matter somewhat , @xmath493 is now a function of @xmath28 through the dependence of @xmath485 on the energy density , but this dependence is very weak for the energy scales significantly below the planck scale which we are interested in . with this proviso",
    "then , the results for the vacuum dominated branch of section [ infl ] in the second - order model may be carried through to the first - order model by replacing @xmath38 by @xmath493 .",
    "the production of large true vacuum voids , nucleated early on during inflation and swept up to astrophysical sizes by the subsequent expansion , can severely constrain some models of first - order inflation @xcite .",
    "the isotropy of the microwave background can be used to rule out the possibility that there are any voids with a comoving size greater than about @xmath494mpc on the last scattering surface @xcite , which corresponds to a filling fraction of less than about @xmath495 for bubbles nucleated around @xmath496 @xmath49-foldings before the end of inflation .",
    "this means that the percolation parameter at this point during inflation must be less than @xmath495 , requiring @xmath497 this gives the second line in figure 3 showing the minimum permissible value of @xmath498 ( denoted by @xmath499 ) at @xmath496 @xmath49-foldings before the end of inflation at different false vacuum energy densities .",
    "obeying this extra constraint , @xmath500 , requires @xmath501 to be greater than a minimum value at this point and thus @xmath502 in the vacuum dominated regime the value of @xmath3 can be given as a function of the number of @xmath49-foldings before the end of inflation from eq .",
    "( [ efold ] ) @xmath503 which gives the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ phi55 ] ) as a constraint on the mass scales @xmath504 in other words , the mass of the @xmath3 field , @xmath14 , must be large enough for the decrease in the effective mass of the @xmath25 field during the last @xmath496 @xmath49-foldings of inflation to raise the percolation parameter from @xmath495 to unity .",
    "the numerical factor on the right - hand side of this equation is fairly small , typically about @xmath505 for @xmath506 , so this does not threaten to force us out of the small @xmath14 limit . clearly it is minimised for small @xmath374 , as @xmath507 , but can become large if @xmath485 is too close to @xmath508 .",
    "normalising the parameters of the model by the observed density perturbations , as described in section [ infl ] , gives another relation between @xmath14 and @xmath28 which , combined with the big - bubble constraint , provides limits on either @xmath14 or @xmath28 alone : @xmath509 for reasonable values of the coupling parameters , of order unity , we would expect the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ bbbigm ] ) to be @xmath510 placing a lower limit on @xmath28 of around @xmath511gev in a first - order model , unless we have @xmath485 very close to @xmath508 . the other way to allow first - order models at lower energy scales would be to introduce a strong coupling @xmath38 , much larger than unity , between the two fields , which is clearly always possible as this enables only a small change in @xmath3 to effect a large change in the bubble nucleation rate .",
    "the ability of a second scalar field to allow a first - order inflationary phase transition to complete was first emphasised by la and steinhardt @xcite .",
    "this is the basis of models of extended inflation based on extensions to the gravitational lagrangian beyond the einstein - hilbert action of general relativity @xcite . in brans - dicke gravity , for instance",
    ", the ricci scalar appears in the action coupled to a scalar field rather than newton s constant and it is this growing brans - dicke field , @xmath512 , which triggers the completion of the phase transition in the @xmath25 field .",
    "however linde @xcite and adams and freese @xcite , pointed out that this basic scenario can also be realised in general relativity by coupling the inflaton to a second scalar field .",
    "linde used the same basic first - order potential @xmath476 as we have , although he used a coleman - weinberg type potential for @xmath3 rolling down from @xmath513 introducing a minimum at a non - zero value .",
    "this would have to be included in the minimum value of @xmath501 and thus @xmath498 .",
    "adams and freese considered a specific interaction rather different to ours where as @xmath3 rolled down its potential , the energy of the false vacuum state actually increased relative to the true vacuum , but their more general discussion was clearly intended to include models such as the one we have examined here .",
    "the bubble nucleation constraints in terms of @xmath485 and @xmath514 are independent of the type of first  order inflation being considered .",
    "extended inflation models consider a first  order potential for the inflaton which does not change during inflation .",
    "thus @xmath498 remains a constant , as does the false vacuum energy density . the time ",
    "varying quantity here is the planck mass which grows during inflation .",
    "thus extended inflation models proceed horizontally , from right to left across the parameter space in figure 3 , completing the phase transition when @xmath515 .",
    "the general relativistic models considered here , and those considered by linde and by adams and freese , proceed almost vertically as the false vacuum energy density remains approximately constant as @xmath498 decreases with @xmath3 . because the percolation parameter @xmath455 is exponentially dependent on the euclidean action , @xmath483",
    ", it is relatively easy to evade the big ",
    "bubble constraints in the general relativistic models varying @xmath498 . in models where only @xmath28 or @xmath42 varies , the percolation parameter tends to grow comparatively slowly making the big ",
    "bubble contraint much more severe , especially as @xmath516 and @xmath517 are already constrained by density pertubations at @xmath518 e - foldings @xcite .",
    "this has led other authors @xcite recently to consider models of extended inflation where non - minimal coupling can also change the shape of the ` effective potential ' , making @xmath519 for instance .",
    "in such cases inflation could again end by a first or second  order transition . in a de sitter",
    "metric the ricci scalar @xmath147 is a constant ( @xmath520 ) so a false vacuum dominated universe in general relativity does not yield a time - varying mass .",
    "but in brans - dicke gravity for instance , where the dominant coupling to the ricci scalar is via the brans - dicke field ( rather than a constant ) the expansion is power - law @xcite rather than exponential and @xmath521 , triggering an instability when @xmath522 .",
    "similar models have been proposed in higher order gravity theories , coupling the @xmath25 field to @xmath523 terms @xcite .",
    "these models extending the gravity lagrangian can be re - written in terms of a general relativistic model with two interacting scalar fields ( the defect field and a dilaton field that acts as the inflaton ) using a conformally rescaled metric @xcite .",
    "but the scalar field lagrangian in this case is rather different from our model as not only @xmath524 but all the mass scales are changed by the dilaton field .",
    "these first  order models thus correspond to a more complicated path on figure 3 , and by making @xmath498 a function of time can also evade the big  bubble constraint .",
    "in conclusion , models of inflation based on einstein gravity , but driven by a false vacuum , offer a range of new possibilities for both theory and phenomenology .    on the particle physics side , we have shown how false vacuum inflation points to new possibiities for model building .",
    "in particular , we have shown that it can occur in a class of supergravity models implied by orbifold compactification of superstrings .",
    "one outcome of that discussion was the intriguing possibility of obtaining a handle on the superstring orbifold , through the fact that one - loop corrections might be the dominant effect determining the spectral index .",
    "much remains to be done of course .",
    "for instance , although we have exhibited a toy model for the scalar field sector of the string derived supergravity theory , we have made no attempt to put it in the context of a realistic model involving other fields as well . in particular",
    "we have not tried to extend to supergravity the identification of the false vacuum with that of peccei - quinn symmetry , which we found was both viable and attractive in the context of global supersymmetry .    in terms of direct cosmological phenomenology , false vacuum dominated",
    "inflation offers the unusual option of a spectral index for the density perturbations exceeding unity , though we have demonstrated that with the cobe normalisation the deviation can only be rather modest with a plausible maximum of around @xmath525 .",
    "there is however additional interest in that one expects topological defects to form as the false vacuum decays ; because essentially all the energy density is available to go into the defect fields , the energy available is much greater than in usual models where reheating is required first , redistributing the energy into a large number of fields .",
    "because of this , structure - forming defects are comfortably compatible with our inflation model when the masses are towards the top of their allowed ranges .",
    "we have also made a preliminary investigation of the details of the phase transition in different regimes , though much remains to be done . for a second - order phase transition , results already exist in the literature describing the inflaton dominated regime .",
    "we have demonstrated that , barring very weak couplings , the phase transition proceeds very rapidly in the vacuum dominated regime , but have been unable to develop a solid understanding of the statistics of the defects produced in such a transition . in the first - order case , where the transition completes via bubble nucleation ,",
    "we have gone on to calculate the bubble distribution and the constraints upon it .",
    "we note that first - order inflation models based on einstein gravity are generally easier to implement than those of the extended inflation type .",
    "that one can have both structure - forming topological defects and inflation raises a host of possible structure formation scenarios , as one could choose to utilise only one of these two or a combination of the two .",
    "it is believed @xcite that for a given size of density perturbation ( i.  e.  perturbation in the gravitational potential ) , defects give a larger microwave background temperature anisotropy , by a factor of a few .",
    "one could therefore arrange for defects to be the source of a component of the cobe signal while having only a modest effect on structure formation ; alternatively one could aim to have inflation and defects contributing roughly equally to structure formation in which case the defects would be predominant in the microwave background .",
    "it is conceptually ( and calculationally ) preferable to take the option of using only one source , lowering the energy scale of the other to make its effects negligible , but one should be aware that the required scales of the two are similar , and should a realistic model along our suggested lines be devised it would not be a particular surprise should both contributions have a role to play .",

    "<S> we present a detailed investigation of chaotic inflation models which feature two scalar fields , such that one field ( the inflaton ) rolls while the other is trapped in a false vacuum state . </S>",
    "<S> the false vacuum becomes unstable when the magnitude of the inflaton field falls below some critical value , and a first or second order transition to the true vacuum ensues . </S>",
    "<S> particular attention is paid to the case , termed ` hybrid inflation ' by linde , where the false vacuum energy density dominates , so that the phase transition signals the end of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we focus mostly on the case of a second order transition , but treat also the first order case and discuss bubble production in that context for the first time .    </S>",
    "<S> false vacuum dominated inflation is dramatically different from the usual true vacuum case , both in its cosmology and in its relation to particle physics . the spectral index of the adiabatic density perturbation originating during inflation can be indistinguishable from 1 , or it can be up to ten percent or so higher . </S>",
    "<S> the energy scale at the end of inflation can be anywhere between @xmath0gev , which is familiar from the true vacuum case , and @xmath1gev . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand reheating is prompt , so the reheat temperature can not be far below @xmath2gev . cosmic strings or other topological defects are almost inevitably produced at the end of inflation , and if the inflationary energy scale is near its upper limit they contribute significantly to large scale structure formation and the cosmic microwave background anisotropy .    turning to the particle physics , </S>",
    "<S> false vacuum inflation occurs with the inflaton field far below the planck scale and is therefore somewhat easier to implement in the context of supergravity than true vacuum chaotic inflation . </S>",
    "<S> the smallness of the inflaton mass compared with the inflationary hubble parameter still presents a difficulty for generic supergravity theories . remarkably however </S>",
    "<S> , the difficulty can be avoided in a natural way for a class of supergravity models that follow from orbifold compactification of superstrings . </S>",
    "<S> this opens up the prospect of a truly realistic , superstring derived theory of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility , which we show to be viable at least in the context of global supersymmetry , is that the peccei - quinn symmetry is responsible for the false vacuum .    </S>",
