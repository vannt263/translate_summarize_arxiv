    "an abrupt progress has been recently occurred in cosmic ray physics , which in many respects is a revolutionary change of the current notions of the discipline , due to some measurements of the auger and kascade collaborations .",

    "it has been established that in the energy interval @xmath10-@xmath11 ev the cosmic radiation attaining the solar cavity consists predominantly of intermediate nuclei , and not of pure protons .",

    "the measurement of @xmath13 at a given energy for a number of atmospheric cascades determines the average value of the chemical composition of the cosmic radiation , which is a second method , besides @xmath9 .",

    "it turns out that the auger data are below the minimum values of the predicted @xmath40 profile .",
    "if the cosmic radiation consisted of fe nuclei only , the @xmath41 would occupy the turquoise lower band in figure 2 , which spans from 23 @xmath42/@xmath43 at @xmath44 ev down to 20 @xmath42/@xmath43 at @xmath45 ev @xcite . similarly , the @xmath46 of pure proton cosmic rays would occupy the upper turquoise band in figure 2 , according to the qgsjet code adopted by auger @xcite .",
    "the simulated @xmath41 profile is less sensitive to the qgsjet code ( quite narrow band ) , than the @xmath46 profile ( large band ) . according to the 13 data points on @xmath13 measured by auger ,",
    "the primary cosmic radiation around @xmath47 ev consists abundantly of intermediate and heavy nuclei , since the computed @xmath41 and the observed @xmath13 almost joins .",
    "taking into account the dependence of @xmath48 on the mass @xmath49 of the cosmic nucleus @xcite , any ion abundances at a given energy can be converted into @xmath13 .",

    "it results that the discrepancy between measured and theoretical flux ( black square and extrapolated black curve ) grazes more than two orders of magnitude at @xmath1 ev since the predicted extragalactic proton spectrum below @xmath44 ev has to descend whatsoever with decreasing energy from the value of @xmath52 particles/(@xmath15 sr s @xmath16 ) at @xmath44 ev .",
    "the empirical foundation and solidity of this conclusion is examined in detail elsewhere @xcite : proton fluxes in the kascade data samples in the interval @xmath0 -@xmath1 ev exceed those obtained by qgsjet and sibyll algorithms because of some contamination of the helium sample by protons ( see section 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . enhanced proton data samples augment the flux and decrease error magnitudes in figure 3 .",
    "notice that the silouhette of the proton spectrum according to the dip model @xcite between @xmath1 and @xmath44 ev with @xmath21=2.7 shown in figure 3 ( blue curve ) is @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath25 normalized to some experimental data in the band @xmath55 ev .",
    "figure 5 shows the estimated theoretical profiles of @xmath46 and @xmath41 according to the hires experiment which adopts the hadronic codes qgsjet-1 and qgsjet-2 @xcite .",
    "the first seven data points from auger ( black dots ) in the interval @xmath44-@xmath56 ev would fall above the theoretical @xmath46 profile obtained by the qgsjet-2 code .",
    "therefore , eight auger data points out of 13 would become unphysical ( e.g. cosmic particles lighter than protons ) .",
    "similarly , the last data point ( auger ) is positioned below the theoretical profile @xmath41 suggesting that hyperheavy cosmic nuclei ( @xmath49 @xmath20 @xmath57 ) dominate the cosmic radiation above @xmath47 ev , or more plausibly , again , an unphysical condition develops .",
    "it may not be surprising that , in two independent areas of comparison ( on @xmath9 and @xmath13 , the outcomes of the hires collaboration might disagree with all other experiments .",
    "what is both surprising and embarrassing is that the hadronic codes to simulate nuclear interactions in air , in hires , over many years , generate more protons and less heavy nuclei than hadronic codes adopted in all other experiments .",
    "figure 5 vividly demonstrates it in a recent example @xcite .",
    "the fundamental tenet of the dip model is that protons observed in the solar cavity above @xmath58 ev have a cosmological origin and outnumber any other ion fractions .",
    "since the dip model predicts unreal properties of the cosmic radiation , the @xmath59 dictates , out of a few alternatives , that spatial sources of the cosmic - ray protons are in the cosmic vicinity ( @xmath60 or @xmath61 @xmath62 or @xmath61 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 ) . in this circumstance : how could a softening of the spectral index from 2.6 to about 3.5 take place in the interval @xmath11-@xmath66 ev , if the extragalactic cosmological protons below @xmath11 ev do not reach the solar cavity ?    as the reaction @xmath3",

    "@xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath3 , @xmath7 @xmath8 , etc . can not cause the index softening above @xmath11 ev just because the extragalactic cosmological protons are missing .    the @xmath67 @xmath68 hypothesis that a cosmological extragalactic component would reach the solar cavity in the interval @xmath69-@xmath66 ev but not below this energy band ( second alternative ) confront with three barriers : ( 1 ) protons suffering the energy losses via @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath3 do not disappear but they accumulate below @xmath69 ev corrugating the spectrum ; the dip model , as an example ,",
    "attempts to calculate this effect with a simplified calculation scheme .",
    "( 2 ) any extragalactic accelerators , operating in the specific interval @xmath69-@xmath66 , and eventually above this maximum energy , would intrinsically generate enough spill - over particles in the low energy edge , below @xmath69 , which plausibly corrugate the galactic spectrum .",
    "( 3 ) the rising dominance of heavy ions with energy discovered by the auger collaboration ( see figures 1 and 2 ) in the band @xmath50-@xmath70 ev does not harmonize , for a number of reasons , with the aforementioned index softening .",
    "the common value of 2.6 - 2.8 of the spectral index of the cosmic radiation close and below @xmath69 ev observed in all experiments ( hires , auger , agasa , yakutsk ) , disfavors and belittles the second alternative .    according to the present investigation",
