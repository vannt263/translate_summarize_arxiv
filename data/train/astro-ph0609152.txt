    "the search for very high energy ( vhe , defined as @xmath0 gev ) @xmath1-ray emission from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is one of the major goals for ground - based @xmath1-ray astronomy .",
    "new detections open up a possibility of phenomenological studies of the physics inside the relativistic jets in agns , in particular of understanding both the origin of the vhe @xmath1-rays as well as the relations between photons of different energy ( from radio to vhe ) . the number of extragalactic @xmath1-ray sources detected by egret on board the cgro with high confidence amounts to 66 @xcite",
    ". however , the number of agns reported to be vhe @xmath1-ray emitters ( although slowly increasing ) is currently just thirteen ( july 2006 ) .",
    "stecker et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the attenuation of @xmath1-rays due to photon - photon interactions with low energy photons from the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) was a likely explanation of this deficit .",
    "in fact , the redshifts of blazars detected so far above 100gev have rather low values as expected from predictions of the correlation between the gamma - ray attenuation and the redshift of the source , known as fazio - stecker relation @xcite .",
    "all known vhe gamma - ray emitting blazars belong to the class of high - frequency - peaked bl lacertae objects ( hbls , @xcite ) , a subclass of blazars characterized by a low luminosity when compared with quasars and a synchrotron peak in the x - ray band .",
    "their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) is characterized by a second peak at very high gamma - ray energies . in synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc )",
    "models it is assumed that the observed gamma - ray peak is due to the inverse - compton ( ic ) emission from the accelerated electrons up - scattering previously produced synchrotron photons to high energies @xcite . a compilation of blazars with known x - ray spectra allowing their classification as hbls is given in @xcite .",
    "the major atmospheric gamma - ray imaging cheren - kov ( magic ) telescope observed a sample of x - ray bright ( @xmath2@xmath3@xmath4 ) northern hbls at moderate redshifts ( @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7 ) .",

    "correlations between x - ray and @xmath1-ray emission have been found on time scales ranging from several 10 minutes to days ( e.g. @xcite ) although the relationship has proven to be rather complicated .",
    "the optical - tev correlation has yet to be studied , but the optical - gev correlations seen in 3c  279 @xcite suggest that at least in some sources such correlations do exist . using this as a guideline ,",

    "part of the data were taken in the so - called wobble mode @xcite . in this mode ,",
    "two sky directions , opposite and 0.4@xmath8 off source respectively , were tracked alternately for 20 minutes each .",
    "the advantage of the wobble tracking mode is a simultaneous measurement of the background , and thus _ a  priori _ no need for additional off data .",
    "for calibration , image cleaning , cut optimization , and energy reconstruction , the magic standard analysis chain @xcite was used . for @xmath1/hadron separation as well as for energy determination a multidimensional classification technique based on the random forest method @xcite",
    "the cuts were then chosen such that the overall cut efficiency for monte - carlo @xmath1 events was about 50@xmath12 .",
