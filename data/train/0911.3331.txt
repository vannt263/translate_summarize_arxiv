    "this paper deals with pricing of bilateral counterparty risk credit valuation adjustments ( cva s ) on interest - rate portfolios . the structure of the paper is similar to the earlier work of brigo and capponi ( 2008 ) .",
    "however , while the focus in brigo and capponi ( 2008 ) is on credit default swaps ( cds ) , here it is on interest - rate products , generalizing to the bilateral case the earlier works on unilateral cva for rates products done by sorensen and bollier ( 1994 ) , brigo and masetti ( 2005 ) and brigo and pallavicini ( 2007 ) . indeed , previous research on accurate arbitrage - free valuation of unilateral cva with dynamical models on commodities ( brigo and bakkar ( 2009 ) ) , on rates ( brigo and pallavicini ( 2007 ) ) and on credit ( brigo and chourdakis ( 2008 ) ) assumed the party computing the valuation adjustment to be default - free .",
    "we present here the general arbitrage - free valuation framework for counterparty risk adjustments in presence of bilateral default risk , as introduced in brigo and capponi ( 2008 ) , including default of the investor .",
    "we illustrate the symmetry in the valuation and show that the adjustment involves a long position in a put option plus a short position in a call option , both with zero strike and written on the residual net value of the contract at the relevant default times .",
    "we allow for correlation between the default times of the investor , counterparty and underlying portfolio risk factors .",
    "we use arbitrage - free stochastic dynamical models .",
    "we then specialize our analysis to interest rate payouts as underlying portfolio . in comparing with the cds case as underlying ,",
    "an important point is that most credit models in the industry , especially when applied to collateralized debt obligations or @xmath0-th to default baskets , model default correlation but ignore credit - spread volatility .",
    "credit spreads are typically assumed to be deterministic and a copula is postulated on the exponential triggers of the default times to model default correlation .",
    "this is the opposite of what used to happen with counterparty risk for interest - rate underlyings , for example in sorensen and bollier ( 1994 ) or brigo and masetti ( in pykhtin ( 2005 ) ) , where correlation was ignored and volatility was modeled instead .",
    "brigo and chourdakis ( 2008 ) rectify this in the cds context , but only deal with unilateral and asymmetric counterparty risk .",
    "brigo and capponi ( 2008 ) then generalize this approach for cds , including credit spread volatility besides default correlation into the bilateral case .    in interest - rate products , previous literature dealing with both underlying volatility and underlying / counterparty correlation is in brigo and pallavicini ( 2007 ) , who address both plain vanilla interest - rate swaps and exotics under unilateral counterparty risk . in that work , a stochastic intensity model along the lines of brigo and alfonsi ( 2005 ) and brigo and el - bachir ( 2009 )",
    "is assumed , and this model is correlated with the multi - factor short rate process driving the interest - rate dynamics . netting is also examined in some basic examples .",
    "the present paper aims at generalizing this approach to the bilateral case .",
    "in such a case one needs to model the following correlations , or better dependencies :    * dependence between default of the counterparty and default of the investor ; * correlation between the underlying ( interest rates ) and the counterparty credit spread ; * correlation between the underlying ( interest rates ) and the investor credit spread ; * besides default correlation between the counterparty and the investor , we might wish to model also credit spread correlation .",
    "we will model all such dependencies except the last one , since default correlation is dominant over spread correlation .",
    "also , a feature that is usually ignored is credit spread volatility for the investor and the counterparty , in that credit spreads are usually taken as deterministic .",
    "we improve this by assuming stochastic spreads for both investor and counterparty .    summarizing ,",
    "to avoid confusion , given the plurality of papers we produced in recent years , we can put this paper s contribution into context with respect to our analogous earlier versions for unilateral counterparty risk or for other asset classes through table  [ table : contextcrmodels ] , which is clearly meant only as a partial orientation for our work and not for the overall much broader literature .",
    ".part of earlier analogous literature on cva valuation with respect to inclusion of underlying asset volatilities and/or correlation between underlying asset and counterparties , along with bilateral features .",
