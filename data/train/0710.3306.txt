    "the observation of vacuum rabi oscillations between a quantum dot ( qd ) exciton and a cavity photon represents a distinctive example of cavity quantum electrodynamics realized in a solid state system .",
    "@xcite the strong light - matter coupling in networks of cavities and dots is very attractive for the realization of scalable quantum information devices .",
    "@xcite furthermore , fundamental investigations on quantum phase transitions in extended cavity systems have recently attracted a significant interest .",
    "@xcite the strong light - matter coupling between excitons and photons is often described in terms of polariton modes , which identify propagating electromagnetic modes in a medium with strong dispersive properties . lately , there has been a considerable theoretical and experimental effort on polariton condensation in planar microcavities .",
    "@xcite in the simplest picture , the critical temperature for polariton condensation is inversely proportional to the polariton effective mass .",
    "given their small effective mass ( about four orders of magnitude smaller than excitons ) , quantum well polaritons suggest the possibility of creating a condensate at high temperature .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate diverse geometrical realizations of polaritonic structures , where the photon and matter excitations are confined in different ways",
    ". these diverse geometries could lead both to novel quantum information devices and to novel systems in which coherent matter states can be obtained at room temperature .    in this paper",
    ", we exploit the newly gained opportunity of growing artificial structures with spatial periodicity comparable to the wavelength of the confined quasi - particle , the exciton in our case , and their embedding in a microcavity .",
    "the main idea consists in tuning the exciton energy in such a way that at least two photon modes with different momentum are resonantly coupled to it due to the lattice symmetry .",
    "we assume that the exciton - photon coupling is stronger than the exciton inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "there has been many proposals for engineering exciton - polariton modes using periodic structures : with periodic quantum well ( qw ) bragg structures,@xcite cavity - free three dimensional arrays of qds,@xcite point - dipole crystal,@xcite photonic bandgaps with anti - dots ,  @xcite and confined qw polaritons in mesa structures .",
    "@xcite here we consider a system with a mismatch between the continuous symmetry of the two - dimensional photons in the cavity and the discrete symmetry of a quantum dot lattice . in the proposed structure , the polariton dispersion is entirely determined by the coupling between the exciton in the dots and two dimensional photons , which leads to in - plane effective masses which can be exceptionally small , of order of @xmath0 , for some highly symmetric points in the first brillouin zone .",
    "the group velocity of 2d photons is large for large in - plane momenta .",
    "this can be seen as the underlying reason behind such a small polariton mass at the zone edge .",
    "the extremely small mass makes this structure a promising candidate for novel approaches to high temperature polariton condensation , and for long - range coupling of spin  @xciteor exciton  @xcite qubits .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ ham ] we introduce the system and write the hamiltonian for the qd lattice interacting with the two - dimensional photon modes .",
    "the energy dispersion of the polariton states for some highly symmetric points in the brillouin zone of the square and hexagonal lattice is presented in sec .",
    "iii . in the same section",
    "we also discuss the exciton - light mixing , the effective masses , and the polariton lifetime .",
    "conclusions are found in sec .",
    "iv . in the appendix we provide the explicit form of the exciton - photon coupling constant",
    ", we discuss an optimization procedure for the system design , and we give the exact effective mass expressions .",
    "and refractive index @xmath2 . ]",
    "we consider the system shown in fig .",
    "[ figa ] . a two - dimensional lattice of qds or impurities is placed at the center of a planar cavity structure , i.e. a fabry - prot resonator .",
    "there is currently an intense experimental effort for controlling the growth of qds , based on self - assembly and growth on patterned substrates .",
    "@xcite controlled impurity implantation or micro - patterned electrostatic traps on a quantum well  @xcite are further options to realize the proposed structure .",
    "we assume that the array consists of identical qds and we use the effective mass , envelope function , and single sublevel approximations .",
    "@xcite furthermore , taking into account that the confinement potential of a qd can be modelled by a harmonic potential ,  @xcite   which enables the center - of - mass and relative motion separation,@xcite we write the ground state heavy hole exciton wave function in the qd centered at @xmath3 in the lattice plane as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the electron ( hole ) @xmath6-confinement wave function , @xmath7 is the exciton relative motion wave function with @xmath8 being exciton bohr radius , and @xmath9 is the exciton center - of - mass wave function @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the effective dot radius . by considering only the ground state we assume that the energy of the first excited state is larger than the exciton - photon coupling , which is of the order of a few mev .",
    "we assume that the photon modes are confined by ideal planar mirrors in a cavity of length @xmath12 and we consider only the lowest cavity mode with the photon dispersion @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the speed of light , @xmath2 is refractive index of the cavity , @xmath15 is fixed to @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the in - plane momentum .",
    "finally , the in - plane exciton - photon or polariton hamiltonian in the second quantization reads @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the exciton energy , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the @xmath22 qd exciton creation ( annihilation ) operator with polarization @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the photon creation ( annihilation ) operator for a given polarization @xmath26 .",
    "the constant @xmath27 is the exciton - photon coupling constant for the @xmath28-th qd , which has the property @xmath29 in the following we are going to focus on te cavity modes , and we consider only one exciton polarization . for quantum well polaritons , tm modes give smaller polariton effects due to the weaker light - matter coupling ,  @xcite and we expect the same to be true in the lattice case .",

    "the coupling constant @xmath35 expressed in terms of materials and structure parameters is given in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "moreover , the light - matter interaction conserves the momentum @xmath32 only up to a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "the terms in eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) involving the exchange of reciprocal lattice vectors are known as exciton umklapp - processes in the literature .",
    "@xcite this is in contrast to the qw microcavity case where there is a one - to - one correspondence between cavity and exciton modes ( the in - plane momentum is conserved exactly ) . they can be seen as interband scattering in which a valence electron @xmath36 with momentum @xmath37 scatters with a photon with momentum @xmath38 and creates a conduction electron @xmath39 .",
    "if the final momentum @xmath40 lies outside the @xmath33 bz , then the momentum of the conduction electron is flipped back to the first bz by adding a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "since the photon momentum @xmath38 is not restricted to the @xmath33 bz , the umklapp momentum @xmath41 for excitons can have an arbitrary large magnitude .",
    "this is a difference with respect to electron - phonon umklapp processes ,  @xcite where only the first neighbor reciprocal lattice points are involved .",
    "however , we remark that in eq .",
    "( [ ham2 ] ) the quantum dot - photon coupling has a structure form factor due to the finite size of the quantum dots , i. e. @xmath42 so that we find a natural cut - off for the reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "furthermore , in the photonic case , excitonic corrections due to the coulomb interaction between the conduction electron and the hole left in the valence band have to be included .        for an exciton state with momentum @xmath17 away from the zone boundary ,",
    "many off - resonant umklapp terms give corrections which do not entail qualitative novel properties for the polariton quasi - particles .",
    "however , the situation can be very different if the structure is built in such a way that the exciton is resonant with the cavity at a @xmath43 which is at or near the bz boundary . in that case",
    "we can choose , for instance , @xmath44 and @xmath45 so that the bragg condition @xmath46 is satisfied . in general , the number @xmath47 of reciprocal lattice points satisfying this condition depends on the lattice symmetry and on the energy of the exciton .",
    "the mode configuration leading to the formation of bragg cavity polaritons is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figbb ] , where the exciton energy ( red dashed horizontal line ) is tuned in such a way that the polariton mixing occurs at the zone boundary . due to the reduced symmetry of the dot lattice",
    "the @xmath16 cavity mode is folded giving rise to many photonic branches , each characterized by a different reciprocal lattice vector @xmath48 . in order to visualize this folding ,",
    "the figure shows two repeated bzs .",
    "bragg polariton modes will appear at @xmath43 where two or more photonic branches are crossing and are nearly degenerate with the exciton energy .",
    "these polaritons will have different properties than polaritons usually investigated at @xmath49 .",
    "[ figc ] shows the high symmetry points at the zone boundary for the square and hexagonal lattice for which we will discuss bragg polaritons in the following .    due to the cut - off introduced by the finite quantum dot size ,",
    "we can write the single polariton hamiltonian at fixed @xmath17 in the form @xmath50 furthermore , the finite size of the dots limits the largest reciprocal lattice vector to @xmath51 . if we keep only the @xmath47 resonant terms at the zone boundary satisfying exactly the bragg condition , the matrix eq .",
    "( [ tmatrix ] ) can be diagonalized analytically and we find the two eigenvalues @xmath52 corresponding to the strongly mixed polariton states , as well as the ( @xmath53)-fold degenerate eigenvalue @xmath54 the normal mode splitting ( rabi energy ) , i. e. the difference between the lowest ( lower polariton ) and the highest ( upper polariton ) energy at resonance , is then @xmath55 and is proportional to the square root of the number of reciprocal lattice vectors involved in the bragg condition .",
    "in the square lattice , we focus on bragg polaritons obtained at the @xmath56 and @xmath57 high symmetry points defined in fig .",
    "[ figc ] ( a ) .",
    "the number of photonic branches that can be brought into resonance is determined by the number of points in the reciprocal lattice equidistant to @xmath56 or @xmath57 , according to eq .",
    "( [ bragg ] ) .",
    "there are two nearest equidistant points to @xmath56 ( @xmath58 ) and four nearest equidistant points to @xmath57 ( @xmath59 ) ( see dots in fig .",
    "[ figd ] ) .",
    "however , if we do not concentrate on the lowest photonic branches and the nearest - neighbors in the reciprocal lattice , but e.g. on the second nearest neighbors , then a larger number of reciprocal lattice vectors can be involved . for instance , there are eight second - nearest neighbor equidistant points to @xmath57 ( @xmath60 , see crosses in fig .",
    "[ figd ] ) . in the following",
    "we will label the @xmath57 polariton states as @xmath61 if @xmath59 and @xmath62 if @xmath60 . for the hexagonal lattice ( see fig .",

    "the @xmath65-point is similar to the @xmath56-point of the square lattice and will not be discussed . since it is possible to express explicitly the coupling constant for a given high symmetry point of length @xmath66 ( see eq .",
    "( [ galpha ] ) in appendix  [ appb ] ) . then the normal mode splitting can be written as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the coupling constant at the @xmath56-point .",

    "the lattice constant @xmath70 and cavity length @xmath12 are then adjustable parameters which can be optimized to increase the polariton mixing .",
    "the coupling constant at a high symmetry point with @xmath71 can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a constant which does not depend on @xmath11 , @xmath70 , and @xmath12 .",
    "note that the dependence on the lattice constant @xmath70 is non - monotonic due to the competition between the quantum dot density and the structure factor .",
    "moreover , the exciton - photon bragg resonance condition gives the constraint @xmath74 in order to take into account that distributed bragg reflectors are typically used as mirrors , we have added an effective @xmath75 to the nominal cavity spacer length @xmath12 in the coupling constant .",
    "@xcite by expressing @xmath12 as a function of @xmath70 from eq .",
