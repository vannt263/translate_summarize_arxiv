    "the eigenvalues are more easily accessible when , by a canonical transformation , @xmath35 can be written as a free fermion system .",
    "if @xmath3 and @xmath4 have period one with @xmath36 , then ( [ h ] ) is unitarily equivalent to @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the creation and annihilation operators for electrons at the site @xmath12 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and the boundary condition terms has been omitted .",
    "et al _ @xcite and katsura @xcite have calculated the spectrum of the @xmath5model ( ( [ h1 ] ) with @xmath43 ) and @xmath5model in a transverse field ( [ h1 ] ) , respectively , obtaining the free energy function and the ground state .",
    "subsequently , the @xmath5model with alternating interactions and magnetic moments has been solved by perk _",

    "the partition function is said to be approached directly if it is mapped into a problem of counting spanning subgraphs in a lattice .",
    "direct approach does not require @xmath35 to be diagonalizable but in order to solve the underlying problem certain conditions have to be met .",
    "the basic ingredient for this approach is the trotter formula @xcite , @xmath44 valid for any finite - dimensional matrices @xmath45 ( see e.g. @xcite for extensions and applications ) . the partition function ( [ z ] ) can thus be mapped into a classical two dimensional lattice spin system as explained in detail in the following sections .",
    "there is another relationship between chains of quantum spins and the transfer matrix of two  dimensional classical systems which has been discussed in the excellent review by kasteleyn @xcite .",

    "the ground state energy of hubbard @xcite and heisenberg models @xcite can be obtained by an ansatz to the eigenfunctions of @xmath35 called bethe ",
    "the need for alternative solutions is more demanding since the `` string hypothesis '' ( completeness of the bethe  ansatz eigenstates ) remains unresolved .",
    "last but not least , the interest on the pfaffian method has been renewed in view of a recent result by pinson and spencer @xcite on the universality of critical @xmath51 ising model .",

    "the hamiltonian of the quantum spin system ( [ h ] ) is mapped into a two  dimensional classical spin system .",
