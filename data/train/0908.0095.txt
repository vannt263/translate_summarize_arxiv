    "the old standard cosmological model of a universe full of baryon matter only and regulated by the laws of einstein general relativity provided a remarkable picture to consistently explain the background evolution of the universe from the initial singularity up to the present day .",
    "unfortunately , two observational facts then putted in serious trouble this elegant scenario . on the one hand , it turned out that the gravitational field measured on different scales may not be reconciled with what is inferred from baryonic matter only , the most famous example being represented by the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies @xcite . on the other hand , recent data on the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae ( hereafter sneia ) provided the first evidence for an accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "surprising as it was , the cosmic speed up has been then confirmed by updated sneia data @xcite , the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) as measured by both balloon @xcite and satellites @xcite experiments , and the data on the large scale clustering of galaxies @xcite as estimated from large spectroscopic galaxy surveys .",
    "both these problems have been traditionally solved by adding new ingredients to the cosmic pie , while leaving unchanged the underlying theory .",
    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) has been then invoked to fill the gap between the baryon mass ( constrained by the big bang nucleosynthesis ) and what is needed to reproduce the observed gravitational field . moreover , this mysterious component must not interact with anything but gravitationally so to have escaped any detection notwithstanding the incredible efforts spent up to now to find direct evidence for any dark particle . at the cosmological scales , dark matter still behaves as normal matter so that a further component is needed in order to drive the accelerated expansion .",
    "this new actor on the scene must , moreover , have an unusual negative pressure and not cluster on galactic and cluster scales in order to not oppose gravitational clustering . referred to as dark energy , the nature and nurture of this new term is still debated with the cosmological constant @xmath3 @xcite being the simplest candidate . although added by hand _",
    "ad hoc _ , the cosmological model comprising both of them and known as @xmath3cdm is able to fit extremely well the full dataset at disposal @xcite thus worthing the name of _ concordace model_. notwithstanding this remarkable success , the @xmath3cdm is theoretically unappealing because of several well known shortcomings which motivated the search for other dark energy candidates such as quintessence scalar fields @xcite and modified gravity theories , either introducing higher dimensions @xcite or correting the gravitational lagrangian @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that both dark matter and dark energy can be avoided if one accepts that the problem is not with what is missing , but rather with how we describe gravity . from this point of view , all the evidences for dark matter and dark energy should be rather seen as evidence that something is wrong with the newton - einstein theory of gravity . as a next step , one has therefore to look for a way to modify gravity at both the galactic and cosmological scales possibly finding a unified mechanism explaining phenomena taking place on very different scales such as the flatness of rotation curves and the acceleration of the universe expansion .",
    "generalized einstein - aether theories are one of these proposed mechanisms based on the introduction of dynamical timelike vector field with noncanonical kinetic terms .",
    "such a proposal is not fully new , but builds upon the extensive analysis of standard einstein - aether theories @xcite as phenomenological probes of lorenz violation in quantum gravity .",
    "indeed , the nonvanishing expectation value of the aether field will dynamically select a preferred frame in the spacetime , namely the one in which the time coordinate basis vector @xmath4 is aligned with the direction of the vector field , thus leading to violation of the lorenz and gauge invariance .",
    "the interest in these models was then renewed after the demonstration @xcite that teves , i.e. the fully relativistic and complete mond theory @xcite , can be reformulated as a generalized einstein - aether theory .",
    "later , it has been shown that it is possible to get a mond - like behaviour in the weak field regime of vector models @xcite .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we explore here the cosmological viability of these theories by suitably setting the vector field lagrangian in such a way that the successfull mond phenomenology is recovered in the newtonian limit .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "the basic equations and properties of the vector models are described in sect.ii where we also explain how we choose the vector field lagragian .",
    "sect.iii is devoted to a detailed description of the statistical methodology and the data used to test the models in the low redhift regime with a discussion of the results obtained from the likelihood analysis . a similar test",
    "is then presented and discussed in sect.iv where we add high redhift data to probe this complementary redshift range .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are finally given in sect.v .",

    "the vector field lagrangian @xmath11 may be a whatever covariant and local function , but , following @xcite , we will only consider the case :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a generic function of    @xmath14    @xmath15    it is worth noticing that @xmath16 represents all the possible canonical kinetic terms that we introduce in the vector lagrangian through the generic function @xmath0 thus allowing to have also a noncanonical contribution by these terms .",

    "hereafter , we will denote derivatives with respect to @xmath35 with a dot and to @xmath16 with a prime , and use a subscript @xmath36 to label present day quantities .",

    "let us now assume that the universe is filled by a matter - like term and radiation . since the vector field is only coupled to gravity , the continuity equation    @xmath42    still holds for both matter and radiation and we can therefore write the rhs of eq.([eq : masteq ] ) as    @xmath43 ( 1 + z)^2}{e(z ) } \\label{eq : rhsmaster}\\ ] ]    with @xmath44 the present day density parameter of the i - th component .",
    "eqs.([eq : f1new])-([eq : masteq ] ) clearly show that a key role in determining the cosmic evolution is played by the functional expression adopted for @xmath0 .",
    "a guide to the choice of this quantity is provided by the observation that , in the nonrelativistic regime , the field equations reduce to :    @xmath45 = 8 \\pi g_n \\rho    \\label{eq : modpoisson}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath46    being @xmath47 the gravitational potential sourced by the density distribution @xmath48 . by using the above expression",

    "it is worth noting that such a model thus provides a natural mechanism to explain why one observationally finds that @xmath54 which now emerges as a consequence of the local and cosmological phenomena being different manifestations of the same underlying theory .    since we know that mond makes it possible to fit the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) , it is reasonable to assume that a viable expression for @xmath0 should lead to the same interpolating function @xmath1 which is successfully used on local scales .",

    "actually , since @xmath80 is typically set by the cmb temperature , the simple mondian vector model is fully characterized by only two parameters .",
    "this is the same as the concordance @xmath3cdm model where the same parameters @xmath81 have to be assigned in order to compare the theory with the data .",
    "however , in that scenario , two different ingredients are invoked in order to explain the dynamics of galaxies and the cosmic speed up , while here the solution to both problems comes out as a consequence of the presence of a single vector field .",
    "we can repeat the same steps as before to get the master equation for the case when @xmath0 is given by eq.([eq : fkstand ] ) .",
    "not surprisingly given the similarities of the models , we still get an algebraic relation :    @xmath82 ( 1 + z)^3 + \\kappa \\ln{\\left ( \\eta y + \\sqrt{1 + \\eta^2 y^2 } \\right ) } } { y^2 } } \\end{array } \\label{eq : standmast}\\ ] ]    with @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 defined as above . the relation between @xmath84 and the other model parameters may be obtained as before and turns out to be :    @xmath86    which has still to be solved numerically .",
    "note that , as for the simple case , also the standard mondian vector model is characterized by only two quantities , namely the total matter density parameter @xmath87 and the present day scaled hubble constant @xmath88 .",
    "any model that aims to describe the evolution of the universe must be able to reproduce what is indeed observed .",
    "this is particularly true for the models we are considering since we are introducing a single vector field to get rid of both dark matter and dark energy . matching the model with observations is also a powerful tool to constrain its parameters and , as an interesting byproduct , allows us to estimate some quantities common to every model ( such as the age of the universe @xmath89 and the transition redshift @xmath90 ) to previous literature values .    as a first test",

    "it is therefore worth wondering how @xmath87 and @xmath115 are related .",
    "since our theory reduces to mond in the low energy limit and mond does not need any cold dark matter on the galactic scales ( hence no other matter than the visible one ) , we could argue that @xmath116 should hold . on the other hand , large amounts of missing matter",
    "are needed in order mond to reproduce the observed phenomenology on cluster scales @xcite .",
    "it was therefore postulated @xcite that massive neutrinos ( with @xmath117 ) can play the role of dark mass in galaxy clusters . moreover , solar and atmospheric neutrinos experiments @xcite have shown that the three active neutrinos from the standard model of particle physics mix their flavours which is only possible if they are massive . finally , it is also worth noting that it has been claimed @xcite that a single sterile neutrino with mass in the range 4 - 6 ev is better suited to explain the results of the miniboone experiment , while a 11 ev sterile neutrino has been indeed advocated @xcite in order to solve the mond problems on cluster and cosmological scales .",
    "massive neutrinos decoupled at @xmath118 and since last scattering they have been non relativistic particles so that , from a cosmological point of view , they behave exactly as matter . assuming three families of degenerate neutrinos",
    ", the total matter density parameter will therefore read :    @xmath119    so that the number of model parameters is increased by one updating from @xmath81 to @xmath120 .",
    "it is worth stressing , however , that discriminating between @xmath87 as a single quantity and @xmath87 as function of @xmath120 is only possible if the data at hand depend on them separetely . to understand this point ,",
    "let us consider the sneia hubble diagram .",
    "in order to fit this dataset , we just need the dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath66 which is obtained by solving , e.g. , eq.([eq : simplemast ] ) . to this end",
    ", we just have to set the value of @xmath87 so that all the sneia likelihood will be a function of @xmath81 only and we can not set any constraint on @xmath121 .",
    "that is why we have added the gaussian priors on @xmath114 and @xmath88 in order to make the likelihood explicitly dependent on @xmath115 .",
    "however , since the likelihood is mainly driven by the sneia term , one can forecast that the constraints on @xmath121 will be quite weak because of the degeneracy being only partially broken .",
    ".summary of the results of the likelihood analysis including sneia and gaussian priors on @xmath114 and @xmath88 .",
    "the upper and lower part of the table refers to the simple and standard mondian vector model respectively . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for completeness , we also summarize in table v the values of the present day deceleration parameter @xmath122 , the transition redshift @xmath90 and the age of the universe @xmath89 .",
    "these results strengthen our conclusion that both models , while performining well in the low redshift regime , are actually quite poor in reproducing data probing higher @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , the values of @xmath122 are in reasonable agreement with the results quoted in sect.iiic , even if our @xmath122 values are somewhat extreme . on the contrary",
    ", there is a clear disagreement with the previous estimates of the transition redshift @xmath90 with our results being very high ( also outside the range probed by sneia hubble diagram ) .",
    "such a result furtherly signals that indeed the expansion rate and hence the transition from acceleration to deceleration of our models is too slow . another evidence in favour of this interpretation",
    "is provided by @xmath89 which turns out to be in strong disagreement with both the wmap5 and globular clusters estimate .",
    "indeeed , eq.([eq : deftz ] ) shows that , should we underestimate @xmath66 , the age of the universe turns out to be higher which is just what happens for both mondian vector models .",
    "the large reduced @xmath123 values , the disagreement between the best fit predicted and observed distance priors and the unacceptably high @xmath90 and @xmath89 results should make us conclude that both mondian vector models are unable to fit both the low and high redshift data .",
    "comparing the results in table i and iii , however , makes it evident that the two fitting procedures select very different regions of the parameter space .",
    "it is therefore worth wondering whether there is a problem with the distance priors data rather than with the models .    to this end , it is worth stressing that , although widely used in the recent literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , their estimate is actually model dependent .",
    "indeed , in order to obtain their central values and covariance matrix , one first fits a given model ( typically , the concordance @xmath3cdm one ) to the full cmbr anisotropy and galaxy power spectra dataset using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method to sample the posterior probability .",
    "this same model is then used to compute the distance priors along the chain and then the sample thus obtained is analysed to infer the covariance matrix . as correctly stressed in @xcite ,",
    "this procedure relies on three main assumptions :    1 .",
    "the posterior probability from the cmbr anisotropies and galaxy power spectra is correctly described by the distance priors , i.e. no information is lost when giving away the full dataset in favour of the simplified one ; 2 .   the mean and covariance matrix of the distance priors parameters do not change when the model space is enlarged , i.e. the choice of the fiducial model does not impact the estimate of the priors ; 3 .",
    "these summary parameters are weakly correlated with the input fiducial model parameters so that they can be used as independent constraints .",
    "while the first and third assumptions have indeed been verified @xcite , the second hypothesis can not be fully addressed . on the one hand",
    ", one could argue that , unless a significative amount of dark energy in the early universe is present , all reliable models should match at high redshift , when the effect of dark energy fades away . as a consequence , using the @xmath3cdm as a fiducial model to compute quantities that mainly depend on the high redshift behaviour should not affect the final estimate .",
    "however , even if the background evolution could be the same , it is still possible that the dynamics of perturbation is radically different as is the case with modified gravity theories .",
    "this is indeed what also happens for the mondian vector models we are considering . fixing the model parameters to",
    "the best fit values from the fit to the low redshift data only , we can easily compare the luminosity distance with that for a fiducial @xmath3cdm scenario . as expected ( since they both reproduce the same data ) ,",
    "the two can hardly be discriminated over the range probed , while the hubble parameter only differ by a few percent . while the background evolution is therefore comparable ,",
    "perturbations evolve in a completely different way because of the presence of the vector field . as such",
    ", one can not be sure that the information contained in the cmbr spectrum may still be summarized in the distance priors quantities as for the @xmath3cdm model .",
    "a similar discussion also applies for the the prior on @xmath124 .",
    "moreover , it is worth stressing that this latter quantity actually depends on data probing an intermediate redshift range so that one can not rely anymore on the fading of dark energy at high @xmath2 as is typically done for quantities as , e.g. , the acoustic scale @xmath125 and the shift parameter @xmath126 .    investigating the impact of these problems on the estimate of the distance priors is outside our scope here .",
    "we nevertheless stress that , because of the above considerations , one can not safely reject the mondian vector models because of the disagreement with the distance priors values . as a conservative conclusion ,",
    "we are therefore forced to only report the results being unable to decide whether the problem is with the data or with the fiducial model used to retrieve them .      an alternative way to compare the proposed mondian vector models with standard dark energy models in both the low and high redshift regime",
    "may be obtained by considering the effective eos .",
    "indeed , from the point of view of the background evolution , our models are equivalent to a cosmological scenario made out of dust matter and a dark energy with an effective eos given by :    @xmath127 \\nonumber \\\\ ~ & \\times & \\left [ 1 - \\frac{\\omega_m ( 1 + z)^3}{e^{2}(z ) } \\right ] ^{-1 } \\ , \\label{eq : eoseff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so that the dark energy density parameter reads :    @xmath128 } \\ .",

    "note that the value of @xmath87 in eqs.([eq : eoseff ] ) and ( [ eq : omdeeff ] ) is related to @xmath115 and @xmath132 through eq.([eq : omvsobmnu ] ) so that changing @xmath132 is the same as varying @xmath87 .",
    "both figures shows that the value of @xmath132 set the present day eos with @xmath133 increasing as a function of @xmath132 , even if there is a saturation at small @xmath132 as can be easily understood considering that the smaller is @xmath132 , the less is the impact of massive neutrinos in the energy budget .",
    "it is worth noting that for @xmath134 , it is @xmath135 and @xmath136 takes very small values over the redshift range @xmath137 , i.e. we recover ( for both cases ) a present day cosmological constant .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the fit to the sneia dataset points towards such values of @xmath138 since these make both mondian vector models as similar as possible to the @xmath3cdm one over the range probed by sneia themselves .    on the contrary , in the high redshift regime",
    ", the neutrino mass only plays a marginal role in determining the value of @xmath129 which stays almost constant at value close to the dust one @xmath139 , i.e. the effective eos approximately tracks the matter term .",
    "however , the amount of dark energy is different depending on @xmath132 with lower values of the neutrino density giving rise to a larger @xmath130 in the high @xmath2 regime .",
    "such a behaviour is somewhat counterintuitive since one expects that the effective dark energy fades away in the early universe in order to recover the matter dominated epoch .",
    "actually , one must take into account that our matter term is made out of baryons and massive neutrinos only .",
    "the lower is the neutrino mass , the higher must be the contribute of the effective dark energy ( that in this regime behaves as matter being @xmath140 ) to compensate for the missing cold dark matter .",
    "such a result can also be forecasted going back to eq.([eq : f1 ] ) and noting that , for our best fit models , we find @xmath141 so that , for @xmath142 , it is @xmath143 too .",
    "let us then consider the simple mondian vector model",
    ". inserting eq.([eq : fksimple ] ) and taking the limit for @xmath144 , we approximately get :    @xmath145    so that we indeed recover the usual expression for the hubble parameter for a matter dominated universe with @xmath87 the total ( baryons and massive neutrinos ) matter term ( having neglected radiation ) . from the point of view of the effective dark energy formalism ,",
    "if we reduce the neutrinos contribution , we must add a further term acting as matter and this is indeed provide by the effective dark energy .",
    "this also explains why @xmath146 increases decreasing @xmath138 .",
    "a similar discussion also applies to the standard mondian vector models so that in both cases the final scenario is the one of a universe where the matter term disappears to be replaced by a dark energy fluid acting approximately as matter .",
    "this explains why the inclusion of the distance priors ( probing the high @xmath2 regime ) pushes the best fit towards smaller @xmath138 since , in this case , both mondian models recovers the usual friedmann models which are known to successfully fit these high redshift probes .",
    "as yet said , however , decreasing @xmath138 makes @xmath147 thus worsening the fit to the sneia hubble diagram .",
    "the astonishing successes of mond on the galactic scales and the emergence of a relativistic theory playing the role of its counterpart on cosmological scales have renewed the interest in the search for a possible common explanation of both dark matter and dark energy phenomenology .",
    "vector theories are another way of recovering mond in the low energy limit so that it is worth wondering whether they can also offer an elegant way of speeding up the cosmic evolution without the need of any dark energy source .",
    "the ignorance about the form of the vector field lagrangian may be bypassed relying on the link between the function @xmath0 and the mond interpolating function @xmath1 . since",
    "dark matter is no more present , one should postulate the presence of massive neutrinos in order to fill the gap between the total matter density parameter and the baryons density alone .",
    "moreover , such massive neutrinos are also advocated in order to reconcile the results of solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments on the flavour mixing with the predictions of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we have therefore investigated the viability of two different mondian vector models characterized by @xmath0 expressions corresponding to the simple and standard mond interpolating function . to this aim ,",
    "we have first fitted them against the union sneia hubble diagram using gaussian priors on the physical baryon density @xmath114 and the present day hubble constant @xmath88 in order to break the @xmath148 degeneracy .",
    "both models performs quite well giving a perfect agreement with the sneia data and previous estimates of the total matter density parameter @xmath87 , the deceleration parameter @xmath122 and the age of the universe @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , the ( weak ) constraints on the neutrino mass are consistent with the upper limits set by the mainz - troitz experiment assuming three families of degenerate neutrinos .",
    "should , instead , a single sterile neutrino be the mass dominant component , its estimated mass is in agreement with the constraints from the miniboone experiment also falling in the right range advocated to solve mond problems on cluster scales .    in order to investigate the high redshift behaviour of the models",
    ", we have repeated the likelihood analysis adding the extended set of distance priors .",
    "it turns out that both models should be rejected since they provide now a poor fit to the sneia data and strongly disagree with the observed shift @xmath126 and @xmath124 parameters .",
    "distance priors are , however , estimated through a model dependent procedure so that one can not safely rely on them to exclude models that are radically different from the fiducial one used to extract the constraints on @xmath126 and @xmath124 .",
    "as a consequence , we are unable to conclude whether the disagreement is a failure of the mondian vector models or an expected outcome of the different evolution of perturbations with respect to usual dark energy models because of the action of the vector field .",
    "it is worth remembering that the search for a cosmological counterpart to mond has a long history with vector models being only the most recent proposal . applying a procedure which is simply the generalization of the classical derivation of the friedmann equation from the newtonian force law , but now starting from the mond force law , lue & starkman @xcite derived an expression for the hubble parameter without referring to any underlying modified gravity theory . defining @xmath149 and @xmath150 , they indeed find :          following @xcite , we set @xmath154 with @xmath155 and show in figs.[fig : lsfit ] and [ fig : lsfitbis ] how eqs.([eq : lsgx ] ) and ( [ eq : lsgxbis ] ) compares to the standard and simple mondian vector models . as it is better appreciated from the right panels , both eqs.([eq : lsgx ] ) and ( [ eq : lsgxbis ] ) agree reasonably well with the @xmath156 expression of our mondian models for very high @xmath157 , that is in the early universe .",
    "this is an expected result since , in this redshift range , both our models and the phenomenological lue & starkman proposals recover the typical general relativity matter dominated scenario . on the contrary , for small @xmath157 , i.e. in the very low @xmath2 regime , only the modified expression ( [ eq : lsgxbis ] ) matches reasonably well those for the standard and simple mondian vector models as a consequence of both mimicking an effective cosmological constant . in the intermediate region , however , matching the lue & starkman models to our own is impossible signalling that the strategy adopted by these authors is unable to trace the transition region to general relativity .",
    "however , it is also worth stressing that such a disagreement could be expected since the lue & starkman procedure relies on the assumption that , whatever the underlying modified gravity theory leading to ( [ eq : lsgx ] ) or ( [ eq : lsgxbis ] ) is , the birkhoff theorem still holds .",
    "this is not the case for vector theories @xcite so that the two approaches differ from the very beginning .",
    "as yet quoted in the introduction , much interest has been devoted to the teves theory as a relativistic mond counterpart .",
    "in particular , skordis et al .",
    "@xcite has also investigated the growth of structure in teves also computing the cmbr anisotropy spectrum .",
    "it turned out that the inclusion of a cosmological constant term and of massive neutrinos with @xmath158 may lead to a reasonably good agreement with the data , although a detailed fitting has not been performed . since both",
    "the vector and scalar fields present in teves do not contribute significantly to the dynamics , it is likely that this teves+@xmath3 model matches well both the sneia hubble diagram and the distance priors .",
    "however , comparing the skordis et al .",
    "model to our mondian vector theories is not possible given the radical differences betwee the two approaches .",
    "indeed , teves needs the scalar field to act as a dark matter like term on galactic scales , while the vector field boosts the growth of perturbations during the @xmath3 driven background expansion .",
    "on the contrary , in our approach , the vector models modify the low energy limit poisson equation thus recovering the mond - like behaviour , but also originates the cosmic speed up . in a sense ,",
    "our approach is more _ economical _ claiming for the lowest possible number of ingredients .",
    "the positive results obtained in the low redshift regime may be considered only as a ground zero level analysis .",
    "indeed , fitting the sneia hubble diagram only tells us that the two considered mondian vector models predict the correct background evolution over the redshift range probed by the data , i.e. up to @xmath91 .",
    "needless to say , more tests are needed in order to assess the viability of these models .",
    "on one hand , we can still investigate the background evolution by extending the redshift range through the use of the grbs hubble diagram @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a more significative and demanding test should be fitting both the galaxy power spectrum and the cmbr dataset .",
    "however , both these tasks are quite daunting from the theoretical point of view . indeed ,",
    "as far as we know , the cmbr spectrum has never been computed for the class of vector theories we are considering so that one should first write down the full set of perturbation equations to then modify a numerical code like camb @xcite . somewhat easier ( even if still difficult ) is to deal with the problem of growth of structures in vector models .",
    "indeed , such a study has although been performed in @xcite where the authors considered a simple power - law choice for @xmath0 .",
    "although a detailed fitting to the data was not performed , these authors have convicingly shown that the new degrees of freedom sourced by the vector field may indeed boost the growth of structure even in absence of any dark matter .",
    "this result is a good starting point for testing our proposed mondian vector models provided one accordingly changes the @xmath0 function and introduces massive neutrinos into the game .",
    "note that , since we want to recover mond on galactic scales , we are postulating no cold dark matter so that the observed galaxy power spectrum should be matched to the predicted one with a bias parameter determined by the clustering properties of the massive ( sterile or not ) neutrino .",
    "therefore , such a test is particularly powerful and worth addressing as the next step of our analysis .",
    "it is worth noting that help investigating the viability of our mondian vector models may come from a non astrophysical experiment . indeed , one of the key ingredients in both mondian vector models is the presence of massive neutrinos with @xmath159 .",
    "the katrin experiment @xcite on the tritium @xmath160 decay should be able to constrain the electron neutrino mass with a sensitity of @xmath161 .",
    "should this experiment indeed find that neutrinos are less massive than , e.g. , @xmath162 , our model could be in serious trouble unless one assumes that a single massive sterile neutrino does indeed exist .    as a final remark",
    ", one could note that we have titled our paper with a question so that the reader could now claim for an answer .",
    "unfortunately , because of the uncertainties on the use of the distance priors and the small redshift range probed , the unique answer we can give after our analysis is only a ( somewhat frustrating ) _",
    "maybe_.    it is a pleaure to thank a. snchez for making available the covariance matrix of the distance priors in electronic form and for the illuminating comments on their use .",
    "we also warmly thank g. angus for the instructive discussion on sterile neutrinos in mond , and a. diaferio and a. tartaglia for a careful reading of the manuscript .",
