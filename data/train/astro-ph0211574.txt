    "in fig .  [ all - hc3n ] , the frequencies of all  lines are marked assuming a velocity of the gas of 20.5  . for the emission lines",
    "this is a good assumption but it can be seen easily that all the absorption features are blue - shifted .",
    "this situation is shown in more detail in fig .",
    "[ show_vel - all ] for all unblended lines with either mostly emission or absorption : for the emission lines , there is little variation of velocity with upper energies of the transitions and their average velocity is @xmath30  . for the absorption lines the situation is more complicated .",

    "the velocities of the absorption is almost constant with a velocity of @xmath31  . in the framework of an expanding cooling envelope",
    "this can be interpreted as lower energy lines absorbing mainly from cooler parts of the envelope and higher energy lines from hotter parts closer to the exciting star . a constant velocity for lines higher than 1000  k means , that no is found closer to the star , hence marking the radius of the envelope where the temperature gets small enough that  is more effectively produced than destroyed .    for comparison ,  line velocities taken from martin - pintado & bachiller ( 1992 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ show_vel - all ] as well . a rising blueshift with decreasing energies can also be seen in   but shifted to lower energies above ground .",

    "( 1992 ) found another absorption component at about @xmath3256  , which was later interpreted ( martin - pintado et al .   1993 , 1995 ) as being due to postshocked gas from the interaction of the high velocity outflow with the expanding agb envelope .",
    "in this picture ammonia absorption is found symmetrically at @xmath33 15   from the terminal velocity of the unshocked agb envelope at 40  .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "5 of martin - pintado et al .",
    "in contrast , the  absorption profiles are single peaked , suggesting that  mainly resides in the unshocked gas .",
    "it follows then that the ammonia hc component ( martin - pintado et al .",
    "1992 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ show_vel - all ] is a blending of the redshifted lobe of the postshock material with the hot unshocked inner part of the agb envelope , seen in .",
    "the lines of the ground vibrational state of  show broad lines wings .",
    "hence some  is found in the 200  molecular outflow ( cernicharo et al .",
    "1989 ; neri et al .",
    "we fitted the line wings by masking all blending lines and the fit results are given in tables 14 .",
    "the lines with higher excitation do not show any detectable wings , maybe with the exception of the @xmath34 line .",
    "assuming optically thin emission from the  line wings , the rotational temperature of the high velocity gas is @xmath35  k , where we included the  results of cernicharo et al .",
    "( 1989 ) into the fit .",
    "the corresponding  column density averaged over a 22  beam is @xmath36  .",
    "a rough estimate of the cyanoacetylene level populations can be obtained by using the lines with dominant emission features and plotting the column densities in the levels against energy above ground in a boltzmann diagram assuming optically thin emission .",
    "this leads to a temperature of @xmath37  k which should be considered as the average over all distances from the central star .",
    "since the optical depth of the emission lines is not known a priori , this temperature is only an upper limit .    from fig .",
    "[ show_vel - all ] , it is clear that absorption lines with velocities of 28 to 27  trace the hottest component of the gas on the line of sight in front of the continuum emission . using only these vibrationally excited lines",

    "a more detailed approach is necessary .",
    "we therefore modeled an expanding spherical envelope with radial power laws for temperature , density , and velocity : @xmath43 for the  region in the center we used the parameters derived from our continuum observations in sect .",
    "[ sec - continuum ] .",
    "we then calculated for a given molecular line and velocity the resulting intensity distribution assuming lte conditions ( see appendix  [ sec - rt ] ) , and from that the emerging spectra in our observing beams .",
    "additional free parameters are the systemic ( stellar ) velocity @xmath44 of the envelope , the intrinsic line width @xmath45 , and the @xmath46 ratio . for the inner radius @xmath47 we used the radius of the  region .",
    "our search for the best fit parameters was guided by results of the previous subsections : the velocity at the inner radius @xmath48 was chosen to lie close to the observed velocity of the high energy absorption lines ( fig .",
    "[ show_vel - all ] ) and the temperature at the inner radius has to be of the order of the temperature found from the boltzmann plot of these lines . as a more quantitative approach",
    ", we fit the temperature distribution shown in fig .",

    "the resulting @xmath50 is close to the value estimated from the high energy absorption lines . the resulting power law index @xmath51 of 0.5 constrains the ratio @xmath52 .",
    "the ratio @xmath53 is best determined by the total widths of the p cygni profiles , since it mainly governs out to which velocities absorption / emission is still detected .",
    "finally , the ratio between emission and absorption peaks depends on @xmath54 , which determines the actual spatial size of the emission , hence a large @xmath54 leads to small sizes and hence less emission in the modeled spectra .    at this point",
    ", it is necessary to discuss an important limitation on the accuracy of the  column density determination : the exact temperature dependence of the  partition function , including both the rotational and the vibrational part , is unknown . in a true lte approximation ,",
    "all existing energy states have to be included , which leads for  due to its relatively low vibrationally excited states to a sharp increase of the partition function for temperatures above about 300  k. collisional rates for the excitation of the vibrationally excited states are mostly unknown and the measurements and estimates that exist suggest a fast increase of the resulting critical densities with energies above ground ( wyrowski et al .  1999 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the lines might be populated rather by infrared pumping than collisions . to reflect these uncertainties , we determined the column density using the two possible extreme cases : a ) counting all the states in the partition function and b ) counting only the states up to the highest observed energy above ground .",
    "for the fit we used only unblended lines with small errors on the line frequencies .",
    "the resulting best fit parameters are given in table  [ fit - results ] : the temperature exponent and the inner temperature are close to the values found by meixner et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for cit  6 and crl  618 .",
    "it is clearly hotter and steeper than the temperature structure of an optically thin cloud heated by a central source ( @xmath50=420  k , @xmath55=0.4 ) .",
    "this is not unexpected for the dense , dusty inner part of the crl  618 envelope : if the dust is still optically thick in the nir , the envelope heats itself to higher temperatures by absorbing its own thermal emission , leading to higher temperatures in the inside and a steeper temperature structure ( cf .",
    "[ sec - dusty ] ) .",
    "this power law can also be compared with results from modeling the envelope of irc+10216 , where mamon et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found an inner power law index of 0.72 by fitting the model results of kwan & linke ( 1982 ) .",
    "millar et al .  ( 2000 ) give a temperature index of 0.79 for irc+10216 in excellent agreement with our results toward crl  618 .",
    "for a spherical wind , the equation of continuity requires a density exponent of @xmath56 .",
    "we model a steeper density exponent than this for both forms of the partition function .",
    "since the  density is simply @xmath57 times @xmath58 ( ) , the abundance , this probably means that in the flow  is destroyed or converted into more complex molecules",
    ".    fits to data are shown in fig .",
    "[ 3d - models ] .",
    "most lines show excellent agreement between data and model , which is very surprising given the simple assumptions used .",
    "the remaining small differences can probably be attributed to violations of the assumptions , notably local thermodynamical equilibrium and spherical symmetry ( crl  618 does have a bipolar flow ) .",
    "the results of our lte analysis of the envelope in the last section can be compared with exact modeling of the envelope using calculations of the radiative transport in dusty shells ( dirt : http://dustem.astro.umd.edu , wolfire et al .",
    "1986 ; dusty , ivezi ' c et al .",
    "for the dusty modeling we used a 30000 k black body as radiation source , a mixture of draine & lee ( 1984 ) silicates and graphite with a standard mrn grain size distribution , and a dust temperature of 800  k at the inner boundary .",
    "the density structure was derived within dusty from full dynamics calculations .",
    "the remaining free parameters are the optical depth and the thickness of the envelope .",
    "[ dusty - sed ] shows the model results compared to measured iras and jcmt flux densities ( knapp , sandell & robson 1993 ) .",
    "the optical depth @xmath59 determines the overall shape of the sed , whereas the thickness s = r(out)/r(in ) only modifies the submm part of the sed .",
    "we subtracted the free - free contribution originating from the hii region ( cf .",
    "[ sec - continuum ] ) from the submm emission .",
    "the sed shape of the dusty models is independent of the luminosity , which just scales the model fluxes up or down .",
    "an adequate fit to the data is reached using @xmath60 , a thickness s@xmath61 and a luminosity of @xmath62  .",
    "r(in ) is the dust sublimation radius which is for this model at 0.11 arcsec , hence this is the same radius we used in the last section .",
    "the outer radius r(out ) of 330 arcsec is comparable to the 400 arcsec observed by speck et al .",
    "( 2000 ) with iso .",
    "as seen in the figure , a smaller outer radius can reproduce the submillimeter flux densities .",
    "while these results are interesting in their own right , for our interpretation of the vibrationally excited  lines only the inner part of the envelope is relevant and especially the high optical depths of the envelope .",
    "we checked the inner temperature structure ( thickness s@xmath6310 ) of dusty and dirt models with the high optical depth to fit the sed and found that the temperature falls off considerably faster than in the optical thin case .",
    "while the exact structure of the models differ they can roughly be approximated with @xmath55=0.8 power laws , hence consistent with the results of the last section .",
    "since dusty allows us also to model the envelope expansion by assuming that it is driven by radiation pressure on the dust grains ( ivezi ' c & elitzur 1995 , elitzur & ivezi ' c 2001 ) , we can compare the velocity structure predicted by dusty with our results from the last section .",
    "the model used to fit the sed leads to a terminal wind velocity @xmath64 of 4  km / s for a gas - to - dust ratio @xmath65 and a dust grain bulk density @xmath66  g/@xmath67 . @xmath64 scales with @xmath68 ( see elitzur & ivezi ' c 2001 for details ) . hence , explaining a @xmath64 of order 20  km / s , as implied by our data , would require very unlikely values for @xmath69 and/or @xmath70 .",
    "but even then , the p cygni profiles predicted by a dusty velocity structure would be very broad and less peaked than the observed ones .",
    "the reason is that for radiatively driven , optically thick winds most of the acceleration takes place in a very thin part of the shell : 90% of @xmath64 is reached already at about 2 @xmath71 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the expansion of the crl  618 envelope can not exclusively be due to radiation pressure and other processes have to be invoked , e.  g.  processes related to the powerful outflow associated with crl  618 .",
    "the observed absorption lines can be used to estimate the column density on the line of sight . as discussed in the last section ,",
    "the major uncertainty here is the partition function .",
    "we use again two extreme cases to constrain the column density : using a temperature of 520  k ( sect .",
    "[ sec - temp ] ) the  column density is 36@xmath73  .",
    "to estimate the @xmath46 ratio to a high accuracy , we determined the minimum @xmath74-sum between data and model for the  @xmath21 and the @xmath75 @xmath19 @xmath76 lines .",
    "these lines were chosen , because they appear to be unblended and were observed simultaneously with the same receiver .",
    "hence , in the ratio , all calibration uncertainties cancel out . appearing mostly in absorption ,",
    "these 3 mm lines are much more sensitive to column density than the corresponding @xmath77 lines at the higher frequencies .",
    "the errors in the resulting densities were determined by varying the densities around the best fit values .",
    "this leads to a @xmath46 ratio of @xmath78 and the model fits to all of the @xmath75 lines are shown in fig .",
    "[ 3d-13c ] .",
    "our results include the best determination of the temperature structure in crl  618 so far .",
    "the method we used offers several advantages : ( i ) highly excited absorption lines of  in vibrationally excited states are able to probe the hottest , inner part of the molecular envelope in a pencil beam . since vibrationally excited lines with the same @xmath79 are observed simultaneously , their relative calibration is excellent and the peak temperature found is @xmath38  k. ( ii ) due to the expansion of the envelope , the temperature structure can be determined as a function of velocity .",
    "( iii ) from the emission part of the observed p cygni spectra the spatial extend of the envelope at a certain velocity can be determined , which leads then to temperature structure as a function of radius ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "how does our result compare with previous measurements ?",
    "cernicharo et al .  (",
    "2001 ) find a temperature of 200  k from their iso mid - infrared observations of hcn and @xmath81 .",
    "they were not able to resolve the velocity structure and therefore probe with their absorption lines an average over the whole line of sight , hence a lower temperature . in the analysis of far - infrared iso observations of crl  618",
    "herpin & cernicharo ( 2000 ) distinguish between different shells close to the central star , with temperatures of 1000 , 800 and 250  k , decreasing away from the star with radii of 0.3 , 0.5 and 0.8 arcsec , respectively .",
    "the shells with the higher temperatures than our estimate seem to probe a photon dominated region , where  might not be able to exist yet .",
    "exact modeling of the dusty circumstellar envelope using dusty was able to reproduce the temperature structure and the spectral energy disribution , but failed to predict the observed velocity structure of the envelope , indicating that radiation pressure alone is not sufficient to drive the expansion .",
    "isotopic abundance ratios in agb stars deliver , in principle , valuable information on nuclear processes and dredge - up convective processes that bring up enriched material into the stars outer layers from where they finally end up in the circumstellar envelopes ( see , e.g. balser , mcmullin &  wilson 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath82 abundance ratio of 10 we determine is much lower than the solar system value of 89 .",
    "our ratio is very similar to the @xmath83 ratio of 11.6 derived by wannier &  sahai ( 1987 ) for crl 618 , which is the lowest they found for any of the ten c and one s stars they investigated .",

    "there are thus a number of uncertainties in the determination of the @xmath87 $ ] in crl 618 .",
