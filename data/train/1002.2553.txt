    "current programs of the world leading facilities such as jlab and mami , aims to study the properties of the excited @xmath5 and @xmath6 resonances ( see ref .",
    "new data obtained in these experiments yield valuable information on effective degrees of freedom in the low - energy regime of the qcd .    in spite of many efforts ,",
    "there still exist a number of serious problems in the baryon spectroscopy .",
    "first of them is the problem of missing resonances , which were predicted by the constituent quark models ( cqm ) @xcite , but are still being not observed at the current experiments . additionally , the structure of the roper resonance is not yet well understood .",
    "it is not yet clear , what is the mechanism which lowers the roper s mass .",
    "an opposite picture on the baryon structure is based on the relativistic description .",
    "although the cqms are well adapted for the calculations of the ground and excited baryon spectrum , arguments against the cqm are very serious : a valence quark inside the baryon moves with a velocity , close to the speed of the light .",
    "another fact is that a single pion or gluon can be emitted by a valence quark and be absorbed by the same quark ( through self - energy diagrams ) . after emitting a single boson",
    ", the intermediate quark can excite to the quark or antiquark states , thus yielding the contribution of the sea - quarks to the baryon mass - spectrum .",
    "of course , such diagrams can not be involved in the cqms .",
    "an alternative relativistic cloudy bag model @xcite was not extended to the excited nucleon and @xmath7 sector , though it could explain the proton spin problem @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have developed a relativistic chiral quark model @xcite for the excited @xmath5 and @xmath6 spectroscopy .",
    "the model includes one - gluon and one - pion loop diagrams contributions and reproduces the main properties of the lowest excitation spectrum of the nucleon and @xmath7 .",
    "it was shown that relativistic one - meson and one - gluon exchange forces generate spin 0 , 1 , 2 , etc .",
    "operators , which couple the lower and the upper components of the two interacting valence quarks .",
    "the only contribution to the ground state nucleon and @xmath7 comes from the spin 1 operators , which correspond to the exchanged pion or gluon in the l=1 orbit .",
    "this result can explain naturally , why the @xmath8 resonance appears in the @xmath9-wave of the @xmath10 scattering data , which can not be understood in the frame of the constituent quark models .",
    "the aim of present paper is to show the convergence of the valence quark self - energy diagrams induced by the pion and gluon field configurations .",
    "a convergence of the self - energy induced by pion fields in the present model has been demonstrated for the valence quarks in the ground state @xcite .",
    "however , an extension of the model to the excited @xmath5 and @xmath11 requires to study the behavior of the self - energy for the excited valence quark states .",
    "as it is well known @xcite , the convergence of the self - energy is a serious problem for the bag models due - to the sharp surface quark - pion coupling .",
    "it will be shown in our model , that to reach convergence , one needs to include the contribution of the intermediate quark and antiquark states with a total momentum up to @xmath4 .",
    "this is why a restriction to the lowest modes used in many relativistic calculations is not a good approximation @xcite .",
    "the relativistic quark model is based on an effective chiral lagrangian describing quarks as relativistic fermions moving in a confining static potential .",
    "the potential is described by a lorentz scalar and the time component of a vector potential , where the latter term is responsible for short - range fluctuations of the gluon field configurations @xcite .",
    "the model potential defines unperturbed wave functions of the quarks which are subsequently used in the calculations of baryon properties .",
    "the baryons are considered as bound states of valence quarks , surrounded by a pion cloud as required by the chiral symmetry and by gluons .",
    "interaction of quarks with a pion is introduced on the basis of the linearized @xmath12-model @xcite .",
    "the quark - gluon interaction is introduced on the field - theoretical basis as prescribed by qcd .",
    "calculations are performed perturbatively to second order in the quark - pion and quark - gluon interaction .",
    "all calculations are performed at one loop or at order of accuracy @xmath13 .    in the following",
    "we first give the basic formalism of our approach , then present the numerical results .",
    "the effective lagrangian of our model @xmath14 contains the quark core part @xmath15 the quark - pion @xmath16 and the quark - gluon @xmath17 interaction parts , and the kinetic parts for the pion @xmath18 and gluon @xmath19 : @xmath20\\psi(x ) - 1/f_{\\pi }   \\bar\\psi[s(r ) i \\gamma^5 \\tau^i \\phi_i]\\psi- \\\\",

    "the self - energy terms contain contribution both from intermediate quark @xmath68 and anti - quark @xmath69 states .",
    "these diagrams correspond to the case when a pion or gluon is emitted and absorbed by the same valence quark which is excited to the intermediate quark and anti - quark states . in this way one can estimate the contribution of the sea - quarks to the hadron spectrum that can not be done in non - relativistic quark models .",

    "we note here that a contribution of the intermediate quark states is negative , while intermediate anti - quark states yield larger and positive self - energy .",

    ", one can reach convergent results .    in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown , that the restriction of intermediate quark to the lowest mode is not a good approximation . as we see above , in order to reach convergent results , one needs to go up to large values of the total momentum @xmath95 .",
    "the summary contribution of the pion fields to the @xmath96 is about 200 mev , while the gluon fields yield more than 500 mev shift with the strong coupling constant @xmath84 mostly due - to color - electric field configurations .",
    "contrary , the restriction to the intermediate ground state when estimating the self - energy ( i=0 ) yields too small values for the nucleon energy ( about 500 mev with the appropriate correction on the center of mass motion ) .",
