    "tensor models were initially introduced as models for quantum gravity in @xmath3 dimensions @xcite , by generalizing the matrix models @xcite , which are known to consistently describe the @xmath4 dimensional quantum gravity .",
    "the main idea of the tensor models was that the feynman diagrams obtained via perturbative treatment of the tensor models could be identified with the dual diagrams of simplicial manifolds for @xmath3 dimensions , the summation of which would evaluate in a continuum limit the geometric sum in euclidean quantum gravity .",
    "however , these original tensor models were unsuccessful due to singular or un - oriented feynman diagrams @xcite , and also it was not clear how to take continuum limits , because of the absence of @xmath5 expansions denotes the dimension of the vector space associated to the indices of vectors , matrices and tensors in this paper .",
    "namely , an index runs through @xmath6 .",
    "] , which played essential roles in taking the continuum limits of the matrix models .",
    "this situation has been drastically changed by the advent of the colored tensor models @xcite .",
    "the colored tensor models have a one - to - one correspondence between the feynman diagrams and pseudo - simplicial manifolds , and also have @xmath5 expansions , the leading terms of which are composed of melonic diagrams @xcite .",
    "the melonic diagrams correspond to simplicial manifolds with spherical topology , but are geometrically singular @xcite .",
    "therefore it seems important to modify the leading order or to include higher order @xmath5 corrections to obtain continuum limits of physical interests as in the matrix models .",
    "a number of efforts are currently being made in these directions @xcite .",
    "the colored tensor models have also stimulated the developments of the renormalization group procedure of group field theories @xcite , which are tensor models with group - valued indices @xcite and are studied extensively in the context of the loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the developments above of tensor models concern the euclidean case . in quantum gravity with geometric fluctuations , it would be unclear whether the time - like direction can be treated in the same way as the other space - like directions , which is the standard procedure with wick rotation in field theories on flat space - times .",
    "in fact , in the dynamical triangulation model of quantum gravity , it has been shown that simplicial complexes which can be regarded as smooth space - times in global scale dominate in causal dynamical triangulation @xcite , while dynamical triangulation , the original euclidean model , does not seem successful in this respect .-",
    "fields , the authors in @xcite found a promise of a phase transition higher than first order , which , however , is in conflict with the result in @xcite . ] inspired by this fact , one of the present authors proposed hamilton formalism of tensor models , dubbed the canonical tensor model in short @xcite .",
    "this model has a canonical conjugate pair of three - index tensors as dynamical variables , and is formulated as a totally constrained system with first - class constraints , the algebra of which resembles that of the adm formalism @xcite of general relativity .",
    "a number of intriguing results have been obtained so far in this direction : there exists a formal continuum limit in which the first - class constraint algebra agrees with that of the adm formalism @xcite , the model is unique under some physically reasonable assumptions @xcite , the constraints can consistently be quantized to form a first - class quantized constraint algebra with no anomaly @xcite , locality is favored at least for @xmath7 in the physical wave - function satisfying the quantized constraints @xcite , the @xmath8 case classically agrees with the mini - superspace approximation of general relativity @xcite , and the model with @xmath7 has intimate relations with ising model on random networks@xcite .",
    "while the above results suggest that the canonical tensor model can be an interesting model of quantum gravity , a major question on the validity of the model would be whether its quantum dynamics can produce an object like space - time .",
    "this question may be answered by studying the physical states ( or physical wave - functions in explicit representations ) which satisfy the quantized first - class constraints of the canonical tensor model .",
    "this is rather a difficult task due to the non - linear character of the quantized constraints and so far has been solved only in the case of @xmath7 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the previous paper @xcite implies the intimate relations between the canonical tensor model and statistical systems on random networks@xcite .",
    "in fact , the present paper successfully constructs physical wave - functions satisfying the quantized constraints , general for arbitrary integer @xmath1 , in terms of scale free integration of `` grand - type '' partition functions of statistical systems on random networks ( or rather random tensor networks as we will see ) .",
    "we also obtain other physical wave - functions either by generalizing them for any @xmath1 or by explicitly solving the differential equations representing the constraints for @xmath0 .",
    "the following two properties of the solutions suggest physically interesting directions of future study .",
    "one is that the wave - functions can have peaks at configurations where symmetries are enhanced .",
    "this is explicitly observed for @xmath2 , and we expect this to be true also for higher @xmath1 . in future study , this feature may provide a clue as to why our universe is isotropic and homogenous at large scales .",
    "we also find that the physical wave - functions satisfying the constraints for @xmath9 with a cosmological constant can be obtained by restricting the domains of those for @xmath10 with no cosmological constant .",
    "this suggests that , in the canonical tensor model , a cosmological constant is not an input parameter , but rather a part of dynamics .",
    "this would provide an interesting clue to the problem of the cosmological constant in future study .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ introduction ] , we recapitulate the canonical tensor model and its quantized constraints with a cosmological constant . a classification of physical states in terms of their kinematical and dynamical natures is introduced . in section [ n2 ]",
    ", we obtain the physical wave - functions satisfying the quantized constraints for @xmath7 generally with a cosmological constant by explicitly writing down and solving the partial differential equations . in section [ n3 ] ,",
    "we obtain physical wave - functions on an @xmath11 symmetric subspace of the configuration space in the case of @xmath2 generally with a cosmological constant .",
    "we find that the wave - functions can have peaks at configurations with enhanced symmetries . in section [ sec : ransol ] , we construct physical wave - functions for general @xmath1 with no cosmological constant in terms of scale free integration of partition functions of statistical systems on random networks . in section [ sec : simpsol ] , we obtain physical wave - functions with simpler expressions by generalizing the result in section [ sec : ransol ] . in section [ sec : explicitexample ] , we explicitly evaluate the wave - functions in section [ sec : simpsol ] for @xmath12 to check the validity of the expressions . in section [ sec : solprep ] and [ sec : solmatten ] , we work in a momentum representation and obtain other physical wave - functions for the case of no cosmological constant and general @xmath1 .",
    "we also obtain other types of physical wave - functions in terms of integration over matrix and tensor variables . in section [ sec : wdwcosmo ] , we obtain physical wave - functions for general @xmath1 with a cosmological constant by generalizing the results in section [ sec : solprep ] .",
    "we find that these wave - functions for @xmath9 are just obtained by restricting the domains of the wave - functions for @xmath10 with no cosmological constant .",
    "a general theorem of this aspect is given in section [ sec : generalcosmo ] .",
    "finally , section [ discussions ] is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "the canonical tensor model has been introduced as a theory of dynamical fuzzy spaces @xcite , aiming to construct a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "first of all , the fuzzy space is an extended notion of space defined by a set of functions , @xmath13 , and the product of such functions : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a three - index tensor characterizing the fuzzy space .",
    "for instance , in the case of ordinary @xmath16-dimensional euclidean space , ( [ fuzzy ] ) is given by @xmath17 here @xmath18 can be expressed by a @xmath16-dimensional delta function , @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "this implies that points in euclidean space correspond to functions , @xmath18 s .",
    "as the three - index tensor is a delta function , distant points ( functions ) are independent .",
    "one can extend this notion of localized points to non - local `` fuzzy '' ones using a non - trivial three - index tensor , @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , in general a fuzzy space is non - local and can be of any dimension . in the canonical tensor model , in order to define the physics controlling the dynamics , two external conditions are imposed @xcite .",
    "these are the reality conditions given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 means complex conjugation , and the trace - like property of the inner product , @xmath23 where the inner product , @xmath24 , has been chosen to be real , symmetric and bilinear . if one initially sets the inner product to be positive - definite , one can choose an orthonormal basis : @xmath25 by a real linear transformation preserving the two conditions stated in ( [ reality ] ) and ( [ trace ] ) .",
    "this choice of orthonormal basis in ( [ inner ] ) allows to rewrite ( [ fuzzy ] ) in the following form : @xmath26 using the three - index tensor @xmath27 from ( [ tensor ] ) , it is possible to extract the dynamics of the fuzzy space under the imposed conditions stated in ( [ reality ] ) and ( [ trace ] ) .",
    "the inner product in ( [ inner ] ) is @xmath28 invariant , which appears in the transformations of @xmath29 as @xmath30 this symmetry serves as a kinematical symmetry of the canonical tensor model .",
    "the two conditions , ( [ reality ] ) and ( [ trace ] ) , lead to the generalized hermiticity condition of the three - index tensor : @xmath31 the canonical tensor model stands on the position such that space - time would be a time evolution of the dynamical fuzzy space satisfying ( [ reality ] ) and ( [ trace ] ) , or equivalently the generalized hermiticity condition , ( [ hermite ] ) .",
    "this can be realized in analogy with the adm formalism of general relativity @xcite . in the adm formalism of general relativity ,",
    "one considers the @xmath32-dimensional space - time as a time propagation ( history ) of the @xmath33-dimensional spatial hyper - surface , or in other words , parametrizes the metric in terms of non - dynamical fields , @xmath1 , @xmath34 , and dynamical spatial metric , @xmath35 : @xmath36 then one converts the einstein - hilbert action into the hamiltonian using the spatial metric , @xmath35 , and its conjugate momentum , @xmath37 , as phase - space variables . as a result of general covariance , the hamiltonian can be written as a linear combination of constraints : @xmath38 , \\label{admh}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the generators of temporal and spatial diffeomorphism , respectively .",
    "they are constraints , classified as the first class following dirac s theory of constrained systems .",
    "in fact , the constrains form a closed algebra .",
    "the canonical tensor model has been constructed in the same spirt of the adm formalism , _",
    "i.e. _ , considering the three - index tensor , @xmath27 , and its conjugate momentum , @xmath41 , as dynamical phase - space variables , with the model being introduced as a totally constrained hamiltonian system . one can construct the generators corresponding to the @xmath28-kinematical symmetry , ( [ on ] ) , playing a similar role as the spatial diffeomorphism in general relativity , and remarkably one can uniquely determine the analogue of the temporal diffeomorphism of general relativity , under reasonable assumptions requiring closed constraint algebra , cubic terms at most , invariance under the time - reversal symmetry and connectivity @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are interested in quantizing the canonical tensor model started in @xcite . in the quantum version ,",
    "one replaces the dynamical variable @xmath27 and its conjugate by corresponding operators @xmath42 and its conjugate partner , respectively .",
    "this will be explained later in more detail .",
    "besides , we especially consider the minimal version of the canonical tensor model dubbed _ minimal model _",
    "@xcite , defined by a canonical conjugate pair of real and symmetric tensors , @xmath43 , @xmath44 which satisfy the following commutation relations : @xmath45   = \\frac{i}{6 } \\sum_{\\sigma }   \\delta_{a\\sigma ( d ) } \\delta_{b \\sigma ( e ) } \\delta_{c \\sigma ( f ) } ,   \\ \\    [ \\hm_{abc } , \\hm_{def } ] = [ \\hp_{abc } , \\hp_{def } ] = 0 ,    \\label{commutator}\\ ] ] where the summation over @xmath46 implies that over all the permutations of @xmath47 .",
    "as the minimal model has less degrees of freedom , its quantization is easier to perform and the algebra is more tractable compared to the non - minimal version of the canonical tensor model .",
    "however the minimal model is still complicated enough to capture the non - trivial physics of the system .",
    "it therefore becomes a good theoretical laboratory to gain expertise and maturity in the subject ( see , say @xcite ) .",

    "@xmath62 is a real constant introduced by the operator ordering and has been fixed by imposing the hermiticity of @xmath54 , while @xmath63 is a real undetermined constant which we call _ cosmological constant_. the last physical naming can be justified by its role in comparison with the mini - superspace approximation of general relativity @xcite .",
    "it is worth to recall that , in the case of hermite tensors , the cosmological constant term is prohibited by the consistency of the constraint algebra @xcite , while this term is allowed for the minimal case as above .    in the case",

    "the present and following sections will give further relations between the canonical tensor model and statistical systems on random networks by obtaining the physical wave - functions solving the constraints from the perspective of statistical systems on random networks .",

    ", we do not generally assume the positivity of @xmath230 or the integration contour like , since our interest is in the solutions to the constraint equations rather than such statistical systems . as we will see",

    "as discussed in the previous paper @xcite , a flow generated by a scale - free @xmath28-invariant linear combination of the hamiltonian constraints of the canonical tensor model could be interpreted as a renormalization group flow of statistical systems on random networks .",

    "this would be in accordance with the appearance of a derivative term of @xmath230 in the last line of , and it must be compensated by introducing @xmath247 to make an invariant under the flow .    here",

    "therefore the mathematical properties of the generalized airy functions can be related to those of the partition function .",
    "this observation would be useful in future study .",
    "the solution found in section [ sec : ransol ] has a direct connection with statistical systems on random networks , and would therefore be interesting from physical viewpoints .",

    ". however , there exist at least the following major differences from the statistical systems : the signature of the exponent is opposite , and one can more freely take the integration domain , @xmath232 . therefore , the dynamics would be much different .",

    "then , it is obvious that the product , @xmath338 , with an arbitrary number @xmath339 satisfies .",
    "namely , one can construct one parameter family of solutions to the constraint equations from two independent solutions .",
    "this essentially comes from the fact that the hamiltonian constraints are first - order differential operators in the @xmath75-representation .",

    "one is that , to obtain a positive cosmological constant , we have to perform analytic continuation of @xmath428 to pure imaginary values . on the other hand , the explicit general solutions with a cosmological constant for @xmath0 in section",
    "[ n2 ] and [ n3 ] show that @xmath63 appears without such imaginary numbers .",
    "this suggests that there might be another more improved discussion to ignore a cosmological constant than above .",
    "the second is that it is totally unclear whether all the solutions to the constraint equations with a cosmological constant can be obtained from those with no cosmological constant by the present method of increasing @xmath1 .",
    "what we have shown is merely the reverse ; the latter to the former .",
    "therefore , at present , we do not know whether we can totally ignore a cosmological constant in the analysis of the canonical tensor model .",
    "we leave this interesting possibility for future study .",
    "in this paper , we studied exact physical states in the canonical tensor model .",
    "our interest in this paper was to study the canonical tensor model of higher @xmath1 with and without a cosmological constant , and wherever possible to find the exact general solutions to the constraint equations .",
    "after introduction , we presented an outline of the canonical tensor model in section [ introduction ] .",
    "here we described the constraint algebra and the corresponding equations satisfied by the physical states of the canonical tensor model . here",
    "we also introduced the concept of kinematical and dynamical parts of the states , where the latter reflects the non - linear characteristics of the constraints and would be physically more relevant .",
    "we then proceeded to study the canonical tensor model of various @xmath1 .",
    "the achievements of this paper can be summarized into the following three categories .",
    "the first is that we have explicitly obtained the physical wave - functions for @xmath0 , and have studied their features .",
    "we considered the cases with and without a cosmological constant , and explicitly wrote down and solved the set of the partial differential equations representing the constraints . while the cases without a cosmological constant were more or less straightforward to solve in a standard method ( was indeed previously solved for @xmath7 in @xcite ) , the cases with a cosmological constant set a new challenge . in order to solve them",
    ", we solved on an @xmath429-symmetric subspace in the configuration space for @xmath430 and then extended the solution over the whole space for @xmath7 . remarkably , the solutions in both the cases with and without a cosmological constant turned out to have the same form when expressed with some functions in which all the effects of the cosmological constant are included .",
    "this actually hints that the inclusion of the cosmological constant does not change the structure of the system and tickles our intuition that this can be true even for higher-@xmath1 tensor models . in order to investigate this issue we went through a different path in the last sections .",
    "since we did not assume any boundary ( or initial ) conditions , the solutions contain undetermined functions .",
    "however , we were able to study the possible locations of the peaks of the wave - functions , which would be physically interpreted as enhanced configurations .",
    "we have found that , for @xmath2 with no cosmological constant , the configurations invariant under an @xmath431 symmetry as well as those associated to a grassmann algebra ( this also appears for @xmath7 ) can be enhanced .",
    "moreover , the intersecting points of these two cases have additionally a lorentz boost symmetry . while the @xmath431 and lorentz boost transformations commute with each other for @xmath2 , and thereby do not give rise to any interesting pictures , we expect more non - trivial phenomena to arise in higher-@xmath1 tensor models .",
    "the second is that we have systematically constructed some series of solutions valid for any @xmath1 from the perspective of statistical systems on random networks , or random tensor networks .",
    "it was noticed that the canonical tensor model shares some resemblances with the statistical systems on random networks , where the hamiltonian vector flow of the canonical tensor model corresponds to the renormalisation group flow of the statistical system @xcite .",
    "the `` grand - type '' partition function of the statistical system satisfies the momentum constraints of the tensor model .",
    "however , it does nt satisfy the hamiltonian constraints .",
    "this was cured by integrating the `` grand - type '' partition function in a scale - free manner , which provided a physical wave - function of the canonical tensor model with no cosmological constant .",
    "this is a remarkable achievement , as it gives a series of solutions valid for any @xmath1 .",
    "an important fact noted in the analysis is that the solutions constructed in this manner are dynamical at least for @xmath432 .",
    "an interesting connection between the `` grand - type '' partition function and an extension of airy function was also noticed by transforming the integration variables .    the above process of constructing physical wave - functions was simplified and generalized .",
    "we have constructed more general solutions valid for any @xmath1 and no cosmological constant in terms of simpler expressions with integration over an @xmath1-component vector .",
    "these solutions are dynamical at least for @xmath433 as above .",
    "a similar process of constructing wave - functions for no cosmological constant has been performed in the conjugate ( momentum ) representation . however , these solutions turned out to be kinematical .",
    "then we also considered integration over matrix and tensor variables , and found a new dynamical solution as well as kinematical solutions .",
    "we pointed out that , though kinematical solutions might be of less physical interest than dynamical ones , the former can extend the variations of the latter with continuous parameters .",
    "the third is that we have performed a general analysis of the wave - functions in the momentum representation for the cases with a cosmological constant .",
    "we started with the similar assumptions about the forms of wave - functions and solved the constraint equations .",
    "remarkably , the solutions for @xmath9 with a cosmological constant turned out to be obtained by restricting the domains of the solutions for @xmath10 with no cosmological constant",
    ". then we have proven a general theorem that the latter can always generate the former by such restriction .",
    "this suggests that the effect of the cosmological constant can be absorbed into the dynamics of the tensor model with increased @xmath1 .",
    "this is somewhat like in general relativity , where a de sitter background ( maybe arising due to a cosmological constant ) can be studied by embedding it in a flat space - time of one higher dimension .",
    "this property is also true for more general solutions .",
    "it is now evident that there exist at least some tractable solutions valid for any @xmath1 in the canonical tensor model , though the quantized constraints on physical states are non - linear and complicated .",
    "it would be an interesting question how further we can proceed : is it possible to write down all the solutions in some tractable manners ? on the other hand , from the physical point of view , it would rather be important to obtain a unique physical state which satisfies a physically required initial condition .",
    "then , one can discuss not only the possibilities but the real configurations which become the peaks of the wave - function .",
    "this will inevitably be related with the space - time emergence in the canonical tensor model , and as explicitly shown for @xmath2 , there would be symmetry enhancement , which would be related with why the universe is a homogenous space - time with various gauge symmetries .",
    "this enhancement would also suggest possible connections between the canonical tensor model and the group field theories@xcite , in which lie groups are embedded as input structures .",
    "then , what is the initial condition ?",
    "this question would also be tightly related to what is time in the canonical tensor model , which contains no preferred time variable in its basic formulation .",
    "finally , the discussions on a cosmological constant in this paper strongly suggests that it can totally be ignored .",
    "this would be a really interesting possibility in view of the so - called cosmological constant problem , and we hope to complete the discussions in future study .",
    "gn would like to thanks ns , shinya aoki and others at the yukawa institute for theoretical physics ( yitp ) in kyoto university for providing the wonderful hospitality where a part of the work was done , and is grateful to them for providing the generous financial support .",
    "ys is very grateful to yitp , where a part of this work was done , for their warm hospitality , and would like to acknowledge financial support from yitp : the bilateral international exchange program ( biep ) , and the long - term international exchange program for young researchers .",
