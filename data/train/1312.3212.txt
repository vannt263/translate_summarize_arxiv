    "several line ratios have been suggested to measure the blr metallicity , with the /intensity ratio being the most widely used .",
    "many studies have confirmed the following two basic properties of the blr metallicity : ( 1 ) it is very large , reaching as much as 10 or more times the solar abundance @xcite ; and ( 2 ) it has no cosmological evolution up to redshifts @xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "there are additional sometimes conflicting results suggesting that metallicity correlates with either luminosity @xcite , black hole masses @xcite or eddington ratios @xcite for different samples .",

    "black holes clean up the surrounding metals before the next episode of activity .",
    "this probably is linked with accretion flows , in which self - gravity drives star formation @xcite .",
    "it is far more difficult to use the /or similar ratios of uv lines to measure the metallicity in nlrs in type i agns , because the narrow components of lines such as are very faint @xcite .",

    "we have assembled a sample which includes all of the agns and quasars that we know of for which it has been possible to measure both the broad and emission lines at ultraviolet wavelengths and the narrow , @xmath85007 , , and @xmath86584 emission lines at optical wavelengths .",
    "while there are about 900 agns in the _ iue _ ( international ultraviolet explorer ) and _ hst _ ( hubble space telescope ) data archives , only about 200 of these have also optical spectroscopy from the sdss archive and published work . of this subset",

    "we exclude objects with low signal - to - noise ratios in their stacked uv spectra , broad absorption line quasars and objects with strong and absorption . we also exclude objects having broad balmer emission lines which are so strong that narrow emission lines ( i.e. @xmath17 and/or the narrow components of h@xmath15 and h@xmath14 ) can not be measured , such as bright quasars with `` disappearing '' narrow line regions @xcite .",
    "the final sample contains 31 objects for which we can measure both the blr metallicity and the nlr line ratios .",

    ". a proper check would require high quality uv spectra ) .",
    "these differences do not change our results .",
    "the /line ratio provides a measure of the nlr metallicity .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows that the nlr metallicity does not correlate with either black hole masses , bolometric luminosity or eddington ratios , as was the case for the blr .",
    "a typical nlr is about the same size as a bulge , and if its metallicity is mainly contributed by stellar evolution in the bulge then the two should have metallicities which are roughly similar and which would be expected to gradually increase with cosmic time .",
    "however , the nlr metallicity in high-@xmath20 radio galaxies does not correlate with redshift @xcite .",
    "this agrees with the present results that nlr metallicity neither correlates with black hole masses nor eddington ratios .",
    "additionally , the @xcite relation ( that black hole masses are linearly proportional to bulges of hosts ) implies that if the nlr metallicity originates from stellar evolution of bulges , there should be a correlation between black hole mass and nlr metallicity due to the well - known correlation between metallicity and galaxy masses @xcite .",
    "no such correlation is seen , again suggesting that the nlr metallicity is not dominated by metal production from the host galaxies .",
    "furthermore , it has been found that the nlr metallicity has not undergone cosmic evolution @xcite , but there is a trend with luminosity like the blr metallicity @xcite .",
    "however , the metallicity in star - forming galaxies has significant cosmic evolution , decreasing with redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the question that arises , given that , the metallicity in nlrs maybe not produced by the host galaxy , is : what could possibly be its origin ?",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] compares the nlr and blr metallicities , and shows that they are strongly correlated given the regression coefficient @xmath21 and the null probability of no correlation @xmath22 .",
    "the strong correlation is surprising because blrs and nlrs are separated by scales of about 1.0 kiloparsec .",
    "their metallicities indicate that these two separated regions are in fact physically connected , but _ how _ do they connect ?    the correlation can not be caused by ionisation parameter effects .",
    "the /broad line ratio is weakly proportional to the ionisation parameter ( @xmath23 ) ( see fig .",
    "4 . in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whereas the / narrow line ratio is approximately inversely proportional to @xmath24 ( fig .   8 in @xcite , fig .  8 in @xcite and fig .  13 @xcite )",
    "on the other hand , @xmath23 and @xmath25 could be very different from each other .",
    "the present correlations as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are thus not be caused by @xmath23 and @xmath25 ( estimated in   4.2 ) in the present sample .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the central engines may influence the line ratios of /.",
    "as the seds are controlled by the eddington ratios @xcite , the correlation between blr ",
    "nlr metallicity can not be caused by the different seds because the distribution of the eddington ratios in the present sample is very narrow .",
    "the gas density in nlr should not exceed about @xmath26 , above which forbidden lines are highly suppressed .",
    "furthermore , as indicators of metallicity in blr and nlr , the two line ratios are not sensitive to gas density .",
    "we are therefore led to conclude that there is a link between the metallicities in the nlr and in the blr in these objects .",
    "several models exist in which blr metals are produced by bursts of star formation in the accretion flows that are fueling the central black holes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , but the large metallicity in nlrs remains intriguing .",
    "the key question is to understand how the metallicity can be correlated in these two regions which have such different characteristic sizes ? even though the ionised gas in nlrs is mainly supplied by stellar winds from the bulge , the nlr metallicity of the ionised gas can be strongly affected by outflows developed from the central regions of agns .",
    "the metals delivered to the nlrs by the outflows , specifically by outflows from the blrs , might enhance the metallicity in nlrs .",
    "it is generally accepted that black holes grow episodically with cosmic time @xcite .",
    "the absence of metallicity evolution on cosmological timescales @xcite strongly indicates that , for every episode , the star forming discs initially start from a larger reservoir of gas having the metallicity of the host galaxy , rather than being steadily built up as the same gas cycles through many episodes .",
    "this is consistent with the theoretical expectation for a single episode of smbh activity @xcite . in this model ,",
    "metals are produced in the self - gravitating part of accretion discs as a result of supporting the shakura - sunyaev disc @xcite around smbhs @xcite .",
    "blrs are much more metal - rich than their host galaxies , and therefore the excess metals can not be the products of the stars in the host galaxies . in this picture , a black hole s accretion rate stays approximately constant during a single agn episode , but the blr s metallicity increases monotonically with time , and is regarded as a probe of age of the particular agn episode . in this model ,",
    "no strong correlation is expected between metallicity and either the black hole masses or eddington ratios .    on the other hand , the peak metallicity reached during each episode ( fig .",
    "3 _ left _ panel in @xcite ) might correlate with the eddington ratio .",
    "the individual objects within a sample of agns will have different ages within their respective episodes , and different samples will have different mixtures of ages , which may explain the variety of results ( i.e. lack or presence of correlations between metallicities and eddington ratios , black hole masses and luminosities ) found in different studies .      before addressing possible mechanisms which can account for the observed correlation between the metallicities in the blr and nlr ,",
    "the issue of the role of variations in the ionisation parameter @xmath27 must be assessed in the robustness of the measure of metallicity through the /line ratios .",
    "inspired by the fact that the extended nlrs are at a radial distance from the agn that is similar to the size of the bulge @xcite , we explore the nlr physics within the framework of the coevolution of smbhs and galaxies @xcite in order to understand the evolutionary tracks of agns .",
    "a key assumption is that the nlr clouds are pressure confined by the hot gas from stellar winds in the bulge .",
    "the main features of the nlr model are : ( 1 ) a two - phase medium composed of cold clouds and a hot medium ; ( 2 ) a hot medium from stellar winds in the bulges @xcite , ionised by the central engine radiation and cooled via line emission ; ( 3 ) cold clouds formed from agn outflows whose evidence comes by the usual blue shift of ; and ( 4 ) a star forming disc that produces metals continuously , which are then transported outwards by agn outflows .",
    "the last two assumptions are supported by the strong correlation of nlr and blr metallicities .",
    "assuming photoionisation , we give a simple estimate of the properties of the nlr line emission as follows .",
    "the ionisation parameter is defined by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the ionising luminosity , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the speed of light and the boltzmann constant , respectively , @xmath32 is the nlr size , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the density and the temperature of the ionised gas of cold clouds in the nlr . considering the relation @xmath35}^{1/2}\\propto l_{\\rm ion}^{1/2}$ ] , we have @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that the nlr is composed of numerous discrete clouds , which are confined by the surrounding hot interstellar medium ( ism ) from stellar winds in bulges @xcite .",
    "in such a simple two - phase model , the pressure balance equation reads @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the density and temperature of the hot ism . for the simplest consideration ,",
    "the hot ism has a virialised temperature of @xmath40 .",
    "considering the magorrian relation @xmath41 @xcite and @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 .",
    "it has been suggested that , in the bulge , the hot ism is eventually accreted onto the smbh without going through a static state @xcite . for a simple version of the inflows in the bulge ,",
    "the mass rate is given by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the free - fall speed of the hot gas and @xmath46 is the mass of the bulge .",
    "we assume a simple relation between the smbh accretion rate ( @xmath47 ) and the inflow , so that @xmath48 , yielding the scaling relation @xmath49 as the thermal pressure of the hot ism is @xmath50 , we find that @xmath51 this yields a range of ionisation parameter as @xmath52 . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the scatter of the present sample is @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which implies that @xmath55 . in the detailed calculations of @xcite , the ratio of /is sensitive to the metallicity if the ionisation parameter is within a range of @xmath56 . in the case of the highest sensitivity to the ionisation parameters ,",
    "we find /@xmath57",
    "( for a fixed metallicity of 4@xmath58 ) . the ionisation parameters of the present sample are within the range of validity of the groves et al",
    "this justifies the use of the /line ratios as a proper metallicity indicator .",
    "the recent grid of state - of - the - art models by @xcite confirms these trends .",

    "we have a range of metallicity @xmath61 ( corresponding to /h@xmath15=0.1 - 1.5 ) in our sample .",
    "this is further confirmed by recent state - of - the - art models @xcite which also show that the current sample has this range of metallicities , irrespective of the seds and/or the ionisation parameter ( see their fig . 4 , and note that the updated solar abundance is , in that scale , of @xmath62 , * ? ? ?",
    "nlrs have metallicities ranging between the values found in the bulge and in the blr , according to measurements made in a few objects @xcite .",
    "these preliminary results also indicate that the metallicity in the nlr correlates with emission line luminosity rather than with redshift @xcite .    as fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows , the metallicity of discrete cold clouds in the nlr follows that of the blr , indicating an origin closely connected to the blr .",
    "one natural way for this to happen is agn outflows , which may causally connect the blr and the nlr .",
    "for example , quite a large fraction of lines have blue - shifted wings , indicating the importance of outflows in the nlr @xcite , and more generally these outflows are linked to the feedback processes ( see the detailed discussion by * ? ? ?",
    "cold clouds may partially involve the hot gas from stellar winds in the bulge @xcite .",
    "we represent the metallicity in the nlr by @xmath63 where @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the mass rate of stellar winds from stars in the bulge . the factor",
    "@xmath66 could be significantly smaller than unity ( for some redshifts ) and @xmath67 , leading to @xmath68 , so that @xmath69 is indeed expected .",
    "the correlation found in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] strongly supports this hypothesis .",
    "the metallicity in the bulges , for example , of massive star forming galaxies ( @xmath70 ) is in the range @xmath71 ( e.g. see fig . 6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas the metallicity of nlrs in typical agns is of @xmath72 @xcite . however , the comparison of @xmath73 with @xmath74 is open for the same individual objects , leading to difficulties to estimate the factor @xmath66 .",
    "future studies on this issue will examine several important physical processes ( see a brief discussion at the end of this section ) .",
    "a caveat may arise from the fact that while our sample clearly follows the expected distribution of seyfert 2 galaxies with @xmath75 in the bpt diagram , it perhaps does not trace the underlying density given by the sdss sample ( i.e. perhaps a larger number of blue points should lie towards the liner area in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the reason for this effect is unclear , as our sample is not biased in any of the quantities involved here .",
    "it may reflect the small size of the current sample or perhaps be linked to selection effects within the framework of agn unification schemes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the chemical abundance connection between blrs and nlrs found here provides a new clue for understanding the structure of agns . as a brief summary , fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows a flow chart of the arguments presented in this paper .",
    "if the metals in blrs are produced by the host galaxies , two correlations are then expected : @xmath76 and @xmath77 . neither is supported by any observational evidence .",
    "the same reasoning applies to nlrs .",
    "hence , the only scenario that can explain the present results includes : ( 1 ) a star - forming disc which produces the metals within the blr clouds ; and ( 2 ) outflows produced in the blr transport gas , including metals , to the nlr .",
    "these outflows will impact the host galaxies .",
    "the kinematical effects on the host galaxy s ism and on the further growth of the host galaxy are discussed by @xcite . however , the blr - nlr metallicity correlation found here is a new aspect of agn feedback , which has additional observable consequences which we discuss next .",
    "the metallicities of nlrs and of the host galaxies need to be compared for individual objects in the future .",
    "but we would like to point that the @xmath78 correlation found in this paper indicate that @xmath74 should be larger that of the host galaxy , otherwise the correlation should disappear .",
    "observations with integral field units ( ifu ) may explore the differences in nlr metallicities from their hosts by comparing the metallicity within the ionisation cone ( i.e. the nlr ) and outside of the cone .",
    "this will test the chemical evolution and circulation from the blr and nlr to the host galaxies .",
    "the metallicity correlation between blrs and nlrs has an interesting implication for the further evolution of the agn and its host galaxy . during the active episodic phase",
    ", metals are transported by outflows enriching the nlrs .",
    "the diffusion time scale of metals is @xmath79 years , where @xmath80 is the sound speed , and is much longer than the time scale for metal transportation by outflows @xmath81 years , where @xmath82 ( see a brief review by cappi et al .",
    "this means that metals remain in the nlr gas clouds once they have been transported there .",
    "the metals will significantly shorten the cooling timescale years , where @xmath83 is the ism density and @xmath84 is ism metallicity .",
    "if @xmath85 , the ism cooling is not balanced by the heating , and the ism will condense and form stars .",

    "] of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the bulge .",
    "normally the cooling could be balanced by the agn heating ( radiative and kinetic of outflows ) and other sources of heating .",
    "however , as a result of the metal enrichment of the ism , @xmath88 could be shorter than @xmath89 , leading to star formation as soon as agns have faded away and turned into liners ( e.g. wang & zhang 2007 ; ho 2008 ) . in this case",
    ", the accretion rates of black holes become so low that no broad components of the emission lines appear in these liners , but significant star formation will begin after the outflows from the nuclei have been quenched .",
    "we will call these objects _ blue _ liners whereas liners without significant star formation will be called _ red _ liners .",
    "detailed calculations are needed in order to fully predict the observable signatures of this post - agn star formation in blue liners , but the major features are expected to be : ( 1 ) only narrow emission lines should be seen ; and ( 2 ) a population of young stars should produce significant near infrared emission and/or an ultraviolet excess from massive stars .",
    "liners from blue to red represent a sequence of decreasing star formation rates , and thus constitute an evolutionary sequence for the fading of agns . the fact that the /ratio in liners is larger than in star forming",
    "galaxies could imply that the emission line regions in liners are more metal rich than those in star forming galaxies ( this should be demonstrated by both theory and observations in the future ) .",
    "this might be caused by post - agn star formation further enhancing the metallicity in the liners .",
    "future systematic examinations using _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ observations should be able to discover these blue liners , providing new clues for the understanding of the physical processes of agn fading .",
    "we have carefully assembled in this paper a sample of agns and quasars with redshifts @xmath90 for which the metallicity of both the blr and the nlr can be measured in the optical and uv bands .",
    "this allows us to explore the physical connections between broad and narrow line regions and we find no correlation between metallicity and black hole masses or eddington ratios in either blrs or nlrs .",
    "however , we do find that the metallicities in the nlr follow the metallicities in the blr , with both being substantially enriched above the level of the stellar populations in the bulges of the host galaxies , this suggests that metals are produced in the blrs and then transported to the nlrs through outflows .",
    "the metal - enriched nlrs may undergo star formation once agns begin turning into liners , that is , some post - agn star formation might be triggered .",
    "there is preliminary evidence for this process , but future surveys of post - agn liners are needed to fully unveil this mechanim .",

    "<S> the metallicity of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , which can be measured by emission line ratios in their broad and narrow line regions ( blrs and nlrs ) , provides invaluable information about the physical connection between the different components of agns . from the archival databases of the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ , the _ hubble space telescope _ and the _ sloan digital sky survey _ </S>",
    "<S> , we have assembled the largest sample available of agns which have adequate spectra in both the optical and ultraviolet bands to measure the narrow line ratio /and also , in the same objects , the broad - line /ratio . </S>",
    "<S> these permit the measurement of the metallicities in the nlrs and blrs in the same objects . </S>",
    "<S> we find that neither the blr nor the nlr metallicity correlate with black hole masses or eddington ratios , but there is a strong correlation between nlr and blr metallicities . </S>",
    "<S> this metallicity correlation implies that outflows from blrs carry metal - rich gas to nlrs at characteristic radial distances of @xmath0 kiloparsec . </S>",
    "<S> this chemical connection provides evidence for a kinetic feedback of the outflows to their hosts . </S>",
    "<S> metals transported into the nlr enhance the cooling of the ism in this region , leading to local star formation after the agns turn to narrow line liners . </S>",
    "<S> this post - agn star formation is predicted to be observable as an excess continuum emission from the host galaxies in the near infrared and ultraviolet , which needs to be further explored .    </S>",
