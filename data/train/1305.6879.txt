    "multipartite quantum states contain different kinds of correlations which can or can not be of classical origin .",
    "entanglement has been recognized as the first indicator of non - classical correlations and lies at the heart of quantum information science @xcite .",
    "it has been considered as the resource of almost all protocols in quantum computing .",
    "however , recent research on quantum correlations has shown that entanglement is not the only kind of useful quantum correlation .",
    "quantum discord ( qd ) , which is defined as the discrepancy between two classically equal descriptions of quantum mutual information , has also proven to be utilizable in quantum computing protocols @xcite . moreover ,",
    "qd is more general than entanglement in the sense that it can be present in separable mixed quantum states as well . following this discovery ,",
    "much effort has been put into investigating the properties and behavior of qd in various systems ranging from quantum spin chains to open quantum systems @xcite . nevertheless , since evaluation of qd requires a very complex optimization procedure ,",
    "the significant part of the development in the field is numeric and analytical results are present only for some very restricted set of states . in general , these restrictions are introduced by forcing certain symmetries and limiting the size and the dimension of the system under consideration . a short list of analytical results would include the progress in , @xmath3-shaped states of different dimensions @xcite , @xmath4 dimensional two - parameter class of states @xcite , @xmath5 dimensional werner and pseudo - pure states @xcite , general real density matrices displaying @xmath6 symmetry @xcite , two - mode gaussian states @xcite , and @xmath4 dimensional mixed states of rank-@xmath7 @xcite where @xmath8 denotes the hilbert space dimension of the system under consideration .",
    "qd witnesses have also been introduced for @xmath4 systems @xcite . following",
    "qd , many other quantum and total correlation quantifiers have been introduced @xcite .",
    "bipartite @xmath2 invariant states are defined by their invariance under rotation of both spins , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the usual rotation operator and the length of @xmath11 is chosen according to the spin length @xmath12 @xcite . in other words ,",
    "these states commute with every component of the total spin operator @xmath13 . in real physical systems , @xmath2 invariant density matrices arise when , for example , considering reduced state of two spins described by a @xmath2 invariant hamiltonian or multi - photon states generated by parametric down - conversion and then undergo photon losses @xcite .",
    "entanglement structure of states under certain symmetries has been vastly explored in the literature @xcite . for @xmath2 invariant states , which is central to this work",
    ", negativity has shown to be a necessary and sufficient criterion for separability @xcite and relative entropy of entanglement has been analytically calculated @xcite for @xmath14 and @xmath15 dimensional systems . furthermore , entanglement of formation ( eof ) , a measure which also involves a complex optimization procedure , has been analytically evaluated in the case of mixed @xmath14 dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "recently , a very closely related article came up , which evaluates different correlation measures that are more general than entanglement , in @xmath16 invariant states @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt to explore the quantum discord in @xmath14 dimensional states .    in this work ,",
    "we have analytically calculated the qd of @xmath2 invariant @xmath14 dimensional system .",
    "we have compared our results with the entanglement properties of these states and other analytical calculations of quantum discord in systems having similar symmetries .",
    "we have observed that while entanglement content decreases as @xmath0 increases , amount of qd remains significantly larger with its maximum value also following a decreasing trend .",
    "in this section , we shall review the concept of quantum discord .",
    "we have very briefly mentioned that quantum discord is the difference between the quantum extensions of the classical mutual information .",
    "first and direct generalization of classical mutual information is obtained by replacing the shannon entropy with its quantum analog , the von neumann entropy @xmath17 here , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the reduced density matrices of the subsystems and @xmath20 is the von neumann entropy . on the other hand , in classical information theory ,",
    "mutual information can also be written in terms of the conditional probability .",
    "however , generalization of conditional probability to quantum case is not straightforward since the uncertainty in a measurement performed by one party depends on the choice of measurement .",
    "therefore , one has to optimize over the set of measurements made on a system @xcite @xmath21 where , in this work , \\{@xmath22 } is always understood to be the complete set of one - dimensional projective measurements performed on subsystem @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the post - measurement states of subsystem @xmath25 after obtaining the outcome @xmath26 with probability @xmath27 from the measurements made on subsystem @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath28 can physically be interpreted as the maximum information gained about the subsystem @xmath25 after the measurements on subsystem @xmath23 while creating the least disturbance on the overall quantum system .",
    "this quantity is also referred as classical correlations contained in a state @xcite .",
    "since classical versions of the aforementioned expressions for quantum mutual information are the same , one can define a measure for quantum correlations , namely the quantum discord as @xmath29 main challenge in the calculation of quantum discord is the evaluation of classical correlations , since it requires a complex optimization over all measurements on the system .",
    "the reason that there is no general analytical results on quantum discord except for very few special cases , is due to this difficulty .",
    "it is important to note that quantum discord is dependent on which subsystem the measurements are done .",
    "since making the measurements on spin-@xmath0 subsystem will make the optimization procedure even harder , in this work , all measurements are made on the spin-@xmath1 subsystem .",
    "furthermore , qd can increase or decrease under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) if the locc is performed on the measured part of the system @xcite .",
    "this is a rather peculiar behavior since invariance under locc is the defining property of entanglement .",
    "the bipartite state under consideration is composed of a spin-@xmath0 and a spin-@xmath1 subsystems .",
    "@xmath2 invariant states , are parameterized by a single parameter which will be denoted by @xmath30 throughout this paper .",
    "density matrix for our system in total spin basis is given as @xcite @xmath31 we shall start by calculating the quantum mutual information .",
    "bipartite density matrix has two eigenvalues @xmath32 and @xmath33 with degeneracies @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the reduced density matrices of the subsystems can be found as @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the identity matrix in the dimension of the hilbert space for spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 particle , respectively .",
    "note that both @xmath18 and @xmath19 are maximally mixed independent of @xmath0 .",
    "thus the mutual information of our system is @xmath40    we now turn our attention to the calculation of the classical correlations",
    ". we will perform projective measurements on the spin-@xmath1 part of the density matrix . in order to do that",
    ", first we need to write the density matrix in the product basis . by using the clebsh - gordan coefficients for coupling a spin-@xmath0 to spin-@xmath1 , density matrix in product basis",
    "can be written as @xmath41 here @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the appropriate clebsh - gordon coefficients . following @xcite , we can write any von neumann measurement on @xmath19 as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , any unitary matrix in su(2 ) . here , both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are real and @xmath49",
    ". after the measurements are performed , @xmath50 will transform into an ensemble of post - measurement states with their corresponding probabilities @xmath51 . in order to calculate possible post - measurement states @xmath52 and their corresponding probabilities @xmath53",
    ", we write @xmath54 since transformation of the usual pauli matrices under @xmath55 and @xmath56 is known @xcite , it is easier to calculate the post - measurement states when the spin-@xmath1 part of the density matrix is written in terms of them . in order to do that , we will use following identities @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 for @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "we have calculated the probabilities of obtaining two possible post - measurement states as @xmath65 and the corresponding post - measurement states themselves as @xmath66|m\\rangle\\langle m| \\\\",
    "\\nonumber   & -(z_1+iz_2)\\frac{\\sqrt{j(j+1)-m(m+1)}(2fj+f - j)}{2j(j+1)(2j+1)}|m\\rangle\\langle m+1|   \\\\",

    "the eigenvalues of the post - measurement states are the same and by inspection , they can be found as @xmath72 where @xmath73 for half - integer @xmath0 with @xmath74 being the floor function and @xmath75 for integer @xmath0 .    in calculation of the post measurement states",
    ", we have followed the way introduced in @xcite .",
    "considering the symmetry of the states considered in this work , an alternative and a more direct way to obtain the eigenvalues of the post measurement states is present .",
    "continuing directly from ( 8) @xmath76 applying the projection operators to the spin-@xmath1 part of the density matrix , one can get the post measurement states as @xmath77 and @xmath78 since both of these matrices are diagonal and free of measurement parameters , it is straightforward to calculate the eigenvalues and eventually , the qd of these states .",
    "the eigenvalues obtained from these post measurement states are equivalent to the ones presented in ( 15 ) .",
    "it can be clearly seen that that the eigenvalues do not depend on the measurement parameters .",
    "therefore , calculation of the classical correlations do not require any optimization over the projective measurements .",
    "then , the classical correlations can be written as @xmath79 combining the above equation with ( 5 ) , we have obtained an analytical expression for qd in the system under consideration @xmath80 where @xmath81 is given at ( 15 ) .",
    "@xmath82 , @xmath83 @xmath84 , @xmath85 @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xmath88 . ]    in fig . 1",
    ", we present our results on qd and @xmath89 as a function of our system parameter @xmath30 for different dimensions .",
    "we recover the results obtained in @xcite in the special case of two spin-@xmath1 system . we know that for @xmath50 , the boundary between separable and entangled states is at @xmath90 @xcite , which is half of the value that both qd and @xmath89 vanish @xmath91 .",
    "one can observe that as the dimension of the system increases , both qd and @xmath89 increase in the region @xmath92 and decrease in the region @xmath93 .",
    "eventually , in the infinite @xmath0 limit , both of them become symmetric around the point @xmath94 where they are exactly zero .",
    "the symmetry around @xmath94 clearly starts to manifest itself at system dimensions as low as @xmath85 ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the maximum value of qd is attained for @xmath96 for all system dimensions which corresponds to the state that is the projector on to the spin-@xmath97 subspace .",
    "it is important to note that as @xmath98 , our system becomes completely separable while qd remains finite except for a certain point , with its maximum value following a decreasing trend .",
    "this behavior can also be seen explicitly if we look at the large @xmath0 limit of ( 20 ) as @xmath99 where @xmath100 .",
    "the symmetry point @xmath94 is apparent in the above equation and decreasing trend of the maximum value of qd can also be seen analytically as a function of @xmath0 . in the same limit for @xmath5 werner states @xmath101 and qd is again symmetric around this point .",
    "therefore , for @xmath102 , it is possible to find an entangled and a separable state possessing same amount of qd @xcite .",
    "from the right panel of fig .",
    "1 , it is clear that classical correlations decay in the limit @xmath98 .",
    "however , its maximum settles to a fairly high value as compared to @xmath5 werner states .     for @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) ( left panel ) and for @xmath85 ( @xmath95 )",
    "( right panel ) ]    we will now compare the amount of qd and entanglement possessed in our system .",
    "eof for a spin-@xmath1 and a spin-@xmath0 @xmath2 invariant states is given by @xcite @xmath105 \\\\",
    "h\\left(\\frac{1}{2j+1}\\left(\\sqrt{f}-\\sqrt{2j(1-f)}\\right)^2 \\right ) , & f\\in[2j/(2j+1),1 ] , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the binary entropy .",
    "in contrast to @xmath5 werner states , the point in the parameter space for which eof becomes non - zero is dependent on @xmath0 . in @xcite , it was shown that eof becomes a general upper bound for qd in @xmath5 werner states . however , in figure 2 , we can see that except @xmath103 case , qd always remains larger than eof for all @xmath30 and the difference between these quantities increase as @xmath98 . note that the region in which eof remains zero covers the whole parameter space in the same limit .",
    "we have analytically calculated the qd of a @xmath2 invariant system , consisting of a spin-@xmath0 and a spin-@xmath1 subsystems .",
    "we have compared our results with entanglement structure of these systems and qd of states having similar symmetries .",
    "it is known that a very small subset of the set of states addressed in this work possess entanglement as the dimension of the spin-@xmath0 particle becomes larger .",
    "we have shown that in the large @xmath0 limit , qd remains significantly larger than the entanglement .",
    "on the other hand , we have seen that maximum value of qd decreases with the increasing system size .",
    "observation of @xmath2 invariant states in many real physical systems , make them a good candidate for utilization in quantum computing protocols that rely on qd .",
    "the authors would like to thank g. karpat for fruitful discussions , yao - kun wang for an helpful comment , and an anonymous referee for important comments on the alternative way of finding the eigenvalues of the post measurement states .",
    "this work has been partially supported by the scientic and technological research council of turkey ( tubitak ) under grant no .",
