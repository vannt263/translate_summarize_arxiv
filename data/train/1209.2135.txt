    "the multiplicity frequency of o - type stars in clusters or associations is large .",
    "@xcite find that @xmath1 of o - stars in open clusters are members of relatively short period , spectroscopic binairies .",
    "@xcite considered the total numbers of spectroscopic ( short period ) and angularly resolved binaries ( long period ) and derived an estimate of @xmath2 for o - stars with some companion , but this estimate must be a lower limit because the intermediate period range ( years to decades ) remains largely unexplored .",
    "spectroscopic detection of companions to o stars presents many problems .",
    "the high luminosities of early - type stars can easily outshine spectroscopic companions with a difference of just a few temperature subtypes , and/or a single luminosity class .",
    "some o stars are rapid rotators with broad lines that can hide the spectral features of a companion , even with high resolution spectra .",
    "systems may also be seen at an unfavorable inclination to our line of sight , reducing the shifts of spectral features that would be observed . some combination of these three scenarios results in the detection of such systems as low - amplitude , single - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb1 ) , or no detection of velocity variability at all .",
    "we present results on five such systems here that were observed as part of a larger group of o - type stars with little prior observational work and that appear with a binary designation of `` u '' ( unknown ) or `` ? '' ( uncertain ) in @xcite .",
    "the current status of each of these systems is either unknown spectroscopic variability ( hde 229232 and bd@xmath0 ) or known variability but with insufficient data to compute an orbit ( hde 308813 , hd152147 , and hd 164536 ) . with new data presented here (  2 )",
    ", we measure radial velocities , determine orbital elements , and compute stellar parameters for each system (  3 ) , closely following the procedure used to analyze velocity non - variables in paper i of this series @xcite .",
    "we discuss these first single - lined spectroscopic orbits and physical parameters for each system (  4 ) .",
    "we conclude the paper with a discussion about the nature of the unseen companions (  5 ) .",
    "observations of hde  308813 , hd  152147 , bd@xmath0 , and hd  164536 were obtained from 2003 march 16 to 20 ut , 2004 january 13 to 29 ut , and may 27 to june 8 ut with the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 1.5 m telescope and rc spectrograph .",
    "we used grating @xmath3 ( 831 lines per mm , @xmath4    blaze wavelength in the first order littrow configuration ) in second order together with a bg39 or cuso@xmath5 order blocking filter with a slit width of @xmath6 .",
    "the detector was a loral @xmath7 ccd .",
    "this arrangement produced spectra covering the range 4058  4732   with a fwhm resolving power of @xmath8 and a wavelength calibration accuracy of @xmath94 km  s@xmath10 based on the rms scatter of fits to comparison spectra .",
    "the instrumental broadening from this setup , found from the fwhm of the comparison lines , was computed to be equivalent to a doppler broadening of 109 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "exposure times were several minutes in order to reach a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) exceeding 100 per pixel .",
    "each observation was bracketed with hear comparison spectra for wavelength calibration , and numerous bias and flat field spectra were obtained each night .",
    "hde  229232 was observed with the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 2.1 m telescope during an observing run from 2008 november 15 to 21 ut .",
    "these observations made use of the goldcam spectrograph with grating g47 ( 831 grooves mm@xmath10 ) in second order with a cuso@xmath5 order sorting filter .",
    "the detector was the t3kc ccd ( a @xmath11 pixel array with @xmath12 @xmath13 m pixels ) , and the slit width was set to @xmath14 resulting in spectra with a fwhm resolving power of @xmath15 .",
    "the exposure time for hde 229232 was 600 s , enabling a s / n of about 200 per pixel in the continuum .",
    "the wavelength range is 3942  5032   with a wavelength calibration accuracy of @xmath95 km  s@xmath10 based on the rms scatter of fits to comparison lines .",
    "instrumental broadening for these data , again estimated from the fwhm of comparison lines , was found to be 99 km  s@xmath10 .",
    "all spectra were reduced using standard routines in iraf and then rectified to unit continuum via fitting line - free regions .",
    "next , all spectra for a specific target were transformed to a common heliocentric wavelength grid in @xmath16 increments and were placed into a two dimensional array as a function of spectrum wavelength and time . the subsequent velocity measurements and analysis of spectra",
    "may then be done on the entire array of spectra , rather than on each individual spectrum .",
    "to measure both velocities and stellar parameters , we began with an approximate model template for the star .",
    "a simple `` by eye '' fit to several prominent absorption features was made by interpolating in the ostar2002 grid @xcite for stars with @xmath17 kk and in the bstar2006 grid @xcite for stars cooler than 30 kk .",
    "velocities for each spectrum for each object were then measured using the standard method of cross - correlation , and the uncertainty in the resulting velocity was estimated using the method of @xcite .",
    "the model was cross - correlated with each spectrum in the particular object s spectrum stack . prior to cross - correlation",
    ", object dependent emission features and interstellar features were removed , including the broad diffuse interstellar band ( dib ) near @xmath184428  .",
    "the radial velocities are listed in table  [ sb1rvs ] with targets ordered by right ascension .",
    "the table lists the object name , heliocentric julian date of observation , orbital phase ( see below ) , radial velocity , velocity uncertainty , and the observed minus calculated @xmath19 value for each measurement .",
    "note that the quoted velocity uncertainties do not include those uncertainties related to the wavelength calibration of the spectra .    for each object , we ran fits of the radial velocity measurements for eccentric orbits and for circular orbits using the nonlinear , least - squares fitting routine from @xcite .",
    "we note that we did not use any other period search algorithm because our data sets covered all of or significant fractions of each orbital period , so there was no ambiguity in the selection of an initial period estimate for the general orbital fitting scheme .",
    "following @xcite , we computed a statistic based on the rms of the fit for the eccentric and circular cases , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the rms for the eccentric orbital fit , @xmath22 that for the circular orbital fit , and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 represents the number of observations , and @xmath25 the number of parameters fit ( 6 for the eccentric case ) .",
    "values of @xmath26 ( the 5% significance level ) indicate that the eccentric orbit does not statistically improve the fit . for each of the orbits computed here ,",
    "the eccentric fits provided no significant improvement in the residuals , so we adopted circular orbits .",
    "the circular orbital parameters of period , @xmath27 , the time of maximum velocity , @xmath28 , the systemic velocity for the system , @xmath29 , and the velocity semiamplitude , @xmath30 , are listed in table  [ sb1orbitparams ] .",
    "also listed are the mass function , @xmath31 , the projected orbital semi - major axis , @xmath32 , the rms of the fit , and the number of observations .",
    "the radial velocities and orbital solutions are plotted in figures  [ hd308813fit ] through [ hd229232fit ] , as are the uncertainties associated with the wavelength calibration , @xmath33 .",
    "using the final orbit fits we employed a shift - and - add algorithm to the spectrum stack in order to create a higher s / n master spectrum .",
    "these spectra are plotted in figure  [ sb1combospec ] .",
    "stellar parameters were estimated by fitting the master spectrum for each object with model templates from ostar2002 @xcite and bstar2006 @xcite .",
    "initial values for @xmath34 sin @xmath35 were estimated by convolving the model template with the instrumental broadening ( see  2 ) and with a projected rotational velocity ( @xmath34 sin @xmath35 ) function to obtain a broadening function making a rough match of one prominent non - hydrogen absorption line .",
    "the choice of the absorption line used differed based on the temperature of the star .",
    "we adopted linear limb darkening coefficients from @xcite .",
    "a least squares grid search routine was then employed to refine the estimates of @xmath36 and log @xmath37 from fits to several spectral features ( listed for each individual object in the following section ) .",
    "these updated estimates for @xmath36 and log @xmath37 were then used to refine the @xmath34 sin @xmath35 value by comparison of the fwhm measurements of lines in the master spectrum with those from the model template broadened for a range of @xmath34 sin @xmath35 .",
    "the adopted @xmath36 and @xmath34 sin @xmath35 values are means of individual line measurements with uncertainties computed from the standard deviation of the measurements of different lines . for log @xmath37",
    ", we used a weighted average where balmer line wing fits are given twice as much weight in the calculation of means because of their sensitivity to pressure broadening .",
    "it should be noted that we can not measure @xmath38  @xmath35 values less than roughly half our instrumental broadening , or about 50 km s@xmath10 .",
    "another limitation is that both ostar2002 @xcite and bstar2006 @xcite are based on plane - parallel approximations and solar helium abundances",
    ". these approximations may be less accurate for very high luminosity stars , such as hd 152147 , which generally have extended atmospheres and significant winds .",
    "lower values for log @xmath37 indicate the star is evolved , and such stars may also have enhanced helium abundances due to mixing and mass loss .",
    "the entire process of fitting stellar parameters was repeated once to ensure accuracy of the final results .",
    "the derived @xmath36 , log @xmath37 , and @xmath34 sin @xmath35 values are listed in table  [ sb1params ] , along with a spectral classification estimate made by comparing our computed values for @xmath36 and log @xmath37 with tables 4 , 5 , and 6 of @xcite for o - stars , and table 2 from @xcite for the two targets on the border between o- and b - type stars , hde 308813 and hd 152147 .",
    "column 2 in the table lists the spectral classifications for the primary component found in the literature .",
    "the final three columns in table  [ sb1params ] list the parameters used to obtain a spectroscopic parallax distance estimate that is described in detail for each object in the next section .",
    "the variable velocity of hde 308813 and its membership in cluster ic 2944 were first suggested by @xcite based on three observations spaced two years apart . they suggested that hde 308813 may be an sb2 due to differences in velocities from compared to other lines seen on their last plate .",
    "@xcite also measured three velocities , over a time span of 4 days , and suggested the system was a possible single - lined spectroscopic binary .",
    "@xcite gathered 11 velocities over time spans of days to years , and they were therefore unable to discern an orbital period or ephemeris for this system , although they did confirm the sb1 nature suggested by @xcite .",
    "the observations reported here have the benefit of being made over three separate epochs , the second one a 16 day span .",
    "our computed orbital period of 6.340 d ( table  [ sb1orbitparams ] ) is therefore covered twice in that time span .",
    "the radial velocity measurements from @xcite ( @xmath3912 , 18 , and @xmath3940 km s@xmath10 ) , @xcite ( @xmath3910 km s@xmath10 ) , and @xcite ( 21.9,@xmath3913.4 , and @xmath3917.6 km s@xmath10 ) all span the range of velocities we observe .",
    "the data from @xcite are overplotted in figure  [ hd308813fit ] , but were not used in computation of the orbit . including any of the archival data",
    "increased the rms of the fit by at least a factor of two ( presumably due to differences in the way the velocity was measured by these authors ) , so we only fit data reported in this work .",
    "prior @xmath34  sin  @xmath35 measurements are 186@xmath4011 km s@xmath10 by @xcite ( using @xmath41 ) , 196@xmath409 km s@xmath10 by @xcite ( who used the same lines plus @xmath42 ) , and 197 km s@xmath10 by @xcite ( from uv lines in spectra obtained by the hubble space telescope and space telescope imaging spectrograph ) .",

    "the spectral classification of hde 308813 is b0  v. this is very close to the classification by @xcite of o9.5  v.    we can estimate the distance to hde 308813 via spectroscopic parallax . @xcite measured @xmath48 and @xmath49 for hde 308813 .",
    "we adopt @xmath50 for a b0  v star from @xcite and @xmath51 for an o9.5  v star from @xcite . assuming @xmath52 leads to a distance of 2.82 kpc , and this value is listed in column 9 of table  [ sb1params ] .",

    "it should also be noted that the difference in the distances may be due to the uncertainties in our estimation of @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",

    "the systemic velocity from our orbital fit for hde 308813 is 8.5 km s@xmath10 , 2.6@xmath43 from the cluster average , making cluster membership unlikely .",

    "@xcite gives a value of @xmath65 for an o9.5 i star . further assuming a standard value of @xmath52 and using @xmath66 in @xcite for an o9.5 i star , leads to a calculated distance to hd  152147 of 2.11 kpc .",
    "this value does not agree well with the recent distance estimate for hd  152147 of 1.64@xmath400.24 kpc from @xcite that is based on interstellar line strength . nor does this value match with the distance estimate to ngc 6231 given by @xcite of 1.64 kpc .",
    "this may mean our estimate for @xmath56 is inaccurate for the line of sight to hd 152147 , but this also may be evidence suggesting that hd 152147 is not a member of ngc 6231 .",

    "these numbers are all much smaller than the @xmath108 measurements listed in column 5 of table  [ sb1params ] , which is consistent with the idea that these systems are too young to have attained synchronous rotation .",
    "do the line blending effects of the companions influence our results for @xmath108 or @xmath30 ? to check the magnitude of the effect , we can consider the maximum separation of the spectral features of the individual components .",
    "the ratio of maximum doppler separation to projected rotational velocity is @xmath109 by using the mass ratio as computed above , we calculate this separation and list it in column 9 of table  [ sb1comps ] .",
    "these values are all well below unity , meaning the lines of the components are always blended with those of the primary ( except in cases where a lower ionization line appears in the secondary but not in the primary spectrum ) .",
    "the additional fact that the companions are extremely faint means that line blending problems related to measurements of @xmath108 and @xmath30 will be minimal . as an example",
    ", we introduced a model spectrum corresponding to a b3  v star , as estimated for the companion to bd@xmath0 ( column 6 , table  [ sb1comps ] ) , at a shift of @xmath110 and normalized according to the flux ratio .",
    "this object was chosen because it has the largest ratio of @xmath111 , so it should show the largest affect of blending problems .",
    "we chose a @xmath108 of the companion of 20 km s@xmath10 .",
    "such very narrow lines would have more influence on the measured parameters of the primary than wider shallower lines .",
    "measuring the velocity in the same way as described above , we compute a maximum offset of 3.6 km s@xmath10 for velocity measurements , comparable to the measurement uncertainties on an individual spectrum .",
    "we similarly added a secondary model spectrum at @xmath112 to each of the lines used to measure @xmath108 , and calculated a value 5.0 km s@xmath10 higher than previously . therefore , even for the narrowest lined star in our sample , the uncertainty in @xmath108 introduced by the companion is on the order of 5 km s@xmath10 .",
    "although the effects are small , the influence of a companion spectrum on the velocity measurements will be to pull the measurement back toward the rest wavelength of the line .",
    "this will make @xmath30 lower , the mass function lower , and thus the estimate of mass ratio and orbital inclination lower .",
    "consequently , the values of @xmath103 and @xmath35 in table  [ qitab ] are therefore probably lower than the true values .",
    "companions will also have an influence on @xmath36 and log @xmath37 estimates . in the spectral range covered by our data ,",
    "an o - star has several lines that a mid b - star does not .",
    "therefore , the effect will be to make the o - star lines appear shallower , making the o - star appear cooler .",
    "lines are stronger in b - stars , and in combination with an o - star spectrum will make these lines appear deeper , again causing the o - star spectrum to appear cooler .",
    "thus , our estimates for @xmath36 and log @xmath37 are also lower limits and are likely more indicative of the combined spectrum of the binary .",
    "our results from this analysis suggest that all the objects in this sample are sb1 .",
    "this is due to three main effects : low orbital inclination , broad spectral features of the primary stars , and faint companions . in the future ,",
    "high resolution and high s / n spectra may be able to extract the companion spectrum in systems like those studied here @xcite .",
    "the next paper in this series will describe double - lined spectroscopic orbits for galactic o - type stars where companion spectra are clearly seen .",
    "we are grateful to the directors and staffs of kpno and ctio for their help in obtaining these observations .",
