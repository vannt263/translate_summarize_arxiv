    "conventional numerical evaluation of quantum field theory involves evaluating the path integral on a spacetime lattice using mont carlo integration methods .",
    "mont carlo methods have been very successful for many problems and have served to at least roughly confirm the standard model of particle interactions . however , many serious issues are either not yet solved by this approach or not likely to be calculable at all .",
    "these include dealing with actions that are not manifestly positive definite or which have important effects from the details of fermionic interactions beyond the quenched approximation .",
    "consequently , it is worthwhile to search for supplementary methods of numerical calculation .    the source galerkin method ,",
    "although at a relatively primitive stage of development , appears to work on both the lattice and the continuum while dealing with fermions as easily as bosons .",
    "of course , the continuum version of source galerkin completely avoids the usual lattice problem of fermionic multiplicity and the tricks used to minimize errors from this problem .",
    "furthermore , our `` source galerkin '' method is less restrictive as to the class of allowed actions .",
    "source galerkin tends to use significantly less compute time than mont carlo methods but can consume significantly larger amounts of memory .",
    "the formulation of a source galerkin approximation to a given field theory can also require much more initial work and input to the calculation than the usual mont carlo approaches .",
    "we confine this discussion to the continuum analysis of @xmath0 interactions ; examples of lattice calculations have been given elsewhere.@xcite our continuum results to date include non - linear sigma models and four - fermion interactions .",
    "we have gauge theory calculations in progress .",
    "we start with the differential equations satisfied by the the vacuum function @xmath1 for a scalar field @xmath2 with interaction @xmath3 coupled to a scalar source @xmath4 which satisfies the equation : @xmath5 the source galerkin technique is designed to directly solve functional differential equations of this type . before we proceed to outline a solution technique , it is essential to point out that this equation by itself does not uniquely specify a theory.@xcite since it is a set of third order differential equations at every point in space time , it possesses , _ a priori _ , an infinite solution set .",
    "the solution studied in this talk will be the usual one which corresponds to the symmetry preserving solution obtained from evaluating a path integral with real axis definitions for the regions of integration .",
    "this is the solution that is regular in the coupling , @xmath6 , as it approaches zero .",
    "if we write ( [ euc1 ] ) in the form : @xmath7 the source galerkin method is defined by picking an approximation @xmath8 to the solution @xmath9 such that @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a residual dependent on @xmath12 .",
    "we pick the parameters of our approximation to make this residual as small as possible on the average . to give this statement a meaning ,",
    "we define an inner product over the domain of @xmath12 : _ i.e. _ @xmath13 . in addition",
    ", we assume we have a collection of test functions which are members of a complete set : @xmath14 .",
    "the source galerkin minimization of the residual @xmath11 is implemented by setting the parameters of our test function @xmath8 so that projections of test functions against the residual vanish so that @xmath15 as the number of test functions @xmath16 .",
    "the equations defining the quantum field theory are differential equations in the field sources and spacetime .",
    "we can deal with the continuum by taking advantage of our knowledge of functional integration to evaluate integrals of the form : @xmath17 \\exp\\left [ -j^2(x)/\\epsilon^2 \\right ] p(j)\\ ] ] and use this to define an inner product of sources on the continuum as follows : @xmath18 where we have absorbed a factor of 2 by redefining @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is defined by @xmath21    in addition to this inner product definition , we need good guesses for approximate form for @xmath22 and numerical tools to calculate , symbolically or numerically , various functions and their integrals , derivatives , and so on . for most of our calculations ,",
    "we have found it very useful to choose a lesser known class of functions , with very suitable properties for numerical calculation , known as sinc functions .",
    "we take our notation for the sinc functions from stenger:@xcite @xmath23 sinc approximations satisfy many identities,@xcite which make these functions very easy to use for galerkin methods , collocation , integration by parts , and integral equations .    with the definition of a norm and set of expansion functions",
    ", we can postulate an anstz for @xmath1 : @xmath24\\ ] ]    this anstz with only free field structure is very simple and one would not expect to describe the entirety of a given theory with it .",
    "however , the strength of the galerkin method to force convergence to correct answers is often strong enough to yield remarkably good results for the lowest state of a theory .",
    "extremely good approximations to theories are obtained as additional source structure combined with the appropriate spacetime structure is added to the anstz .    in principle",
    ", it is possible to allow the functions multiplying the sources to be totally arbitrary and then to fix them by expanding in sinc functions and apply the galerkin technique .",
    "the associated computations soon demand more memory than is available from current computing systems .",
    "instead we can use our knowledge of the spectral representations of field theory and graphical approaches ( developed from perturbation theory but we emphasize that our approach is not perturbative ) to introduce a beautiful and intuitive approach of regulated lehmann representations to produce candidates for @xmath22 . these build the appropriate spacetime lorentz structure into our approximations and make the operational cost of our numerical approach independent of spacetime dimension . since any exact two - point function can be represented as a sum over free two - point functions an appropriate representation of the two - point function greatly facilitates this approach .",
    "we choose as the basis of our numerical solutions a regulated euclidean propagator structure : @xmath25^{d/2}e^{-sm^2 - \\frac{x^2}{4(s+1/\\lambda^2 ) } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this cutoff in the galerkin test function as well as the definition of inner product assures that we never have to address the issue of a divergence during the course of a calculation , just as in the case of lattice calculation where the lattice spacing serves as the cutoff .",
    "this integral can be approximated using sinc methods @xmath26^{d/2 } \\exp\\left[-z_km^2 - \\frac{x^2}{4(z_k+1/\\lambda^2)}\\right],\\ ] ] here @xmath27 . for practical purposes , a sum over eighty terms with @xmath28",
    "gives accuracy out to twelve digits  more than adequate for most hardware floating - point representations .",
    "thus we have a form for a two - point scalar green function , regulated by the scale @xmath29 with constant computational cost regardless of spacetime dimension .",
    "we can take derivatives explicitly or by construction : @xmath30 where @xmath31    from this representation , we can directly construct a fermion two - point function : @xmath32 these representations mean that free scalar and free fermion results are exact and immediate in any galerkin evaluation of these trivial cases .",
    "we itemize some results obtained using a regulated single propagator with parameters set by the source galerkin method . at lowest order ,",
    "our anstz for the generating functional is @xmath33 results for this anstz are given in figure [ fig : lowest ] .",
    "@xmath34{fig1.eps}\\ ] ]    these results are strikingly accurate and can matched up essentially exactly with results of mont carlo calculations in two and higher dimensions .",
    "we can enhance these results by including additional 4 source terms in @xmath22 .",
    "some simple additional terms that we include with weights and masses to be calculated using the source galerkin technique are the terms of the forms given in figure [ figure : phi4-four - point ] .",
    "@xmath35{fig2a.eps}\\ ] ] @xmath36    the effect of adding a fourth order term is shown in figure [ p4:fig - hhhh - correction ] .",
    "@xmath37{fig3.eps}\\ ] ]",
    "the representation that we have given for the free propagator ( [ green - function - form ] ) provides the basis for an entirely numerical expansion of any feynman graph .",
    "we have examined the possibility of of generating all graphs of a theory through automatic functional differentiation of a vacuum amplitude and then numerically analyzing the resultant expressions using sinc expansions.@xcite this method generates and evaluates graphs at a speed which to our knowledge far exceeds any method used in the past . we believe that it will be possible to calculate to quite high orders in perturbation theory .",
    "we have discussed a method for numerical calculations for field theories on the continuum ; this method being based on the original lattice source galerkin technique.@xcite we presented a lorentz - invariant regulated representation derived from lehmann representations .",
    "this approach has the computational advantages of minimal memory utilization and parallelizable algorithms and also allows direct representation of fermionic green functions .",
    "finally , a number of useful peripheral calculations can be made using this approximate representation : one can calculate diagrams in a regulated perturbation theory , as well as calculating dimensionally regularized loops numerically .",
    "in general , this technique of evaluating field theories takes advantage of the symmetries of the lorentz group ; future work includes the extension of the method to more general internal groups , such as gauge groups or supersymmetry .",
