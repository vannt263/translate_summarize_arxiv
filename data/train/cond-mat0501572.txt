    "cold atoms and , more recently , bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in optical lattices have attracted increasing interest since their first realization  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the formal similarity between the wavefunction of a bec inside the periodic potential of an optical lattice and electrons in a crystal lattice have triggered theoretical and experimental efforts alike .",
    "many phenomena from condensed matter physics , such as bloch oscillations and landau - zener tunneling have since been shown to be observable also in optical lattices  @xcite . in a recent experiment ,",
    "a bec in an optical lattice even made possible the observation of a quantum phase transition that had , up to then , only been theoretically predicted for condensed matter systems  @xcite .",
    "however , an important difference between electrons in a crystal lattice and a bec inside the periodic potential of an optical lattice is the strength of the self interaction and hence the magnitude of the nonlinearity of the system .",
    "electrons in a metal are almost noninteracting whereas atoms inside a bec interact strongly .",

    "is expected .",
    "most experiments to date have been carried out in the regime of shallow lattice depth , for which the system is well described by the mean field gross - pitaevskii equation with a periodic potential .",
    "moreover , the nonlinearity induced by the mean - field of the condensate has been shown , both theoretically and experimentally , to give rise to instabilities  @xcite in certain regions of the brillouin zone . these instabilities are not present in the corresponding linear system , i.e. the electron system .    in this paper",
    "we review and summarize our experimental and theoretical results on the subject of nonlinear landau - zener tunneling and nonlinearity - induced instabilities in a bose - einstein condensate interacting with an external periodic potential .",
    "these two phenomena represent the most dramatic manifestations of nonlinearity in two different regimes of the system . in order to study these phenomena",
    "we have used a single experimental procedure .",
    "the underlying idea is to linearly scan the brillouin zone , by applying a constant acceleration to the periodic potential , and cross the band edge .",
    "then the condensate is released and an absorption picture of the condensate is taken after a time of flight , reflecting the momentum distribution at the time of release . by varying the nonlinearity of the system with a fixed ( large ) acceleration , we can study the nonlinear contributions to the landau - zener effect .",
    "we shall denote this regime as the `` landau - zener '' regime .",
    "on the contrary , by varying the acceleration from very small to intermediate values with a fixed nonlinearity , we can study the stability of the condensate and the effects of nonlinearity on the dynamics .",

    "the energy scale determined by the bare potential strength @xmath66 appears to be irrelevant at the center of the band ; the only relevant energy scale is fixed by the mean field interaction strength @xmath67 . on the contrary ,",

    "therefore when @xmath89 , it is no longer possible to interpret the nonlinearity through an effective potential .",
    "the difference in the tunneling rates in the two directions may be also derived from the difference between the energy gaps @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( fig .",

    "landau - zener tunneling between the two lowest energy bands of a condensate inside an optical lattice was investigated in the following way ( see fig .",
    "[ band - structure ] ) .",
    "initially , the condensate was loaded adiabatically into one of the two bands , either in the ground band or into the excited band .",
    "subsequently , the lattice was accelerated in such a way that , at the bz edge , a finite probability for tunneling into the other band resulted .",
    "after the tunneling event , the two bands had populations reflecting the landau - zener tunneling rate . in order to experimentally determine the number of atoms in the two bands",
    ", we then _ increased _ the lattice depth and _ decreased _ the acceleration . in this way , successive crossings of the band edge resulted in a much reduced landau - zener tunneling probability between the ground band and the first excited band ( of order a few percent ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ band - structure ] .",
    "the fraction of the condensate that populated the ground band after the first tunneling event , therefore , remained in that band , whereas the population of the first excited band underwent tunneling to the second excited band with a large probability ( around @xmath90 percent ) as the gap between these two bands is smaller than the gap between the two lowest bands .",
    "once the atoms underwent tunneling into the second excited band , they essentially behaved as free particles .",
    "for both tunneling directions , the tunneling rate @xmath63 was derived from the ratio between the number of atoms experiencing the tunneling process and the total number of atoms measured from the absorption picture .    in order to verify the experimental procedure for measuring the tuneling rate in both directions and also to verify that in the linear regime the landau - zener tunneling was symmetric , we measured the two tunneling rates as a function of the lattice depth for a condensate in a weak magnetic trap and hence a small value of the interaction parameter @xmath67 . in this case , both tunneling rates were essentially the same and agreed well with the linear landau - zener prediction , as reported in  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , when @xmath67 was increased , the two tunneling rates began to differ .",
    "for instance for the parameter @xmath91 , the measured tunneling rate from the ground to excited state was @xmath92 , whereas we measured @xmath93 in the opposite direction , proving the tunneling asymmetry .",
    "the effective potential description allows us to present within a unified picture the nonlinear landau - zener tunneling rates measured in refs .",
    "@xcite , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ veff_v0_data ] , together with the theoretical predictions .",
    "we derive a qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions of the non - linear landau - zener model , whereas quantitatively there are significant deviations .",
    "we believe these to be partly due to experimental imperfections .",
    "in particular , the sloshing ( dipolar oscillations ) of the condensate inside the magnetic trap can lead to the condensate not being prepared purely in one band due to non - adiabatic mixing of the bands if the initial quasimomentum is too close to a band - gap .",
    "furthermore the amplitude of the shaded areas in fig .",
    "[ veff_v0_data ] points out a strong dependence of the effective potential on the quasimomentum .",
    "if the condensate trapped in the periodic potential has a finite extension in momentum space , the overall effect of the effective potential on the tunneling probability is not restricted to a single quasimomentum but represents a mean effect over all the quasimomenta of the condensate .",
    "these effects could be responsible for the experimental points not falling exactly on the lines corresponding to the effective potential evaluated at the band edge . in any case",
    "the experimental data must fall within the shaded areas corresponding to the band in which the condensate was loaded , as in fig .",
    "[ veff_v0_data ] .    because of the elastic force of the magnetic harmonic trap , it is important in the experiment not to drag the condensate too far from the rest position .",
    "if the condensate is dragged too far , the dragged part starts to feel the restoring force due to the harmonic potential and hence does not feel a _",
    "constant _ force anymore .",
    "for this reason it is not possible to study large @xmath67 values by varying only the harmonic trap frequency . for our experimental parameters ,",
    "@xmath94 was found to be the largest acceptable value , corresponding to a harmonic trap frequency of about @xmath95 .",
    "furthermore , a numerical simulation of the experiment showed that for large values of @xmath67 , for which the magnetic trap frequency was large , the measured tunneling rates were significantly modified by the presence of the trap .",
    "however , we verified in the simulation that when @xmath67 was varied without varying the trap frequency , the asymmetric tunneling effect persisted . in future experiments , one might study large @xmath67 values by increasing the atomic density in the condensate by using an additional optical trap , in order to increase the radial trapping frequency or , alternatively , by using feshbach resonances to vary the atomic scattering legth @xmath8 .",
    "the results of a numerical simulation using the latter method are reported in fig .",
    "[ rvsc ] ( b ) .",
    "in the previous experiment we investigated the dependence of the tunneling probability as a function of the nonlinearity magnitude with fixed acceleration . we have also investigated the stability of the condensate as a function of the acceleration with ( roughly ) fixed nonlinearity  @xcite .",
    "when the condensate acquired a quasimomentum close to the band edge , the unstable solutions of eq .",
    "grow exponentially in time , leading to a loss of phase coherence of the condensate along the direction of the optical lattice . in our experiment , the time the condensate spent in the ` critical region ' where unstable solutions existed , was varied through the lattice acceleration . when the acceleration was small the condensate moved across the brillouin zone more slowly and hence the growth of the unstable modes  @xcite became more important .",
    "[ peaks]c and  [ peaks]d show typical integrated profiles of the interference pattern obtained for a lattice acceleration @xmath56 . here , the condensate reached the same point close to the brillouin zone edge as in figs .",
    "[ peaks]a and  [ peaks]b , but because of the longer time it spent in the unstable region , the interference pattern was almost completely washed out .",
    "it is also evident that the radial expansion of the condensate was considerably enhanced when the brillouin zone was scanned with a small acceleration .    in order to characterize more quantitatively our experimental findings on the instability , we defined two observables for the time - of - flight interference pattern . by integrating the profile in a direction _ perpendicular to _ the optical lattice direction",
    ", we obtained a two - peaked curve ( see fig .",
    "[ peaks ] ( a ) ) for which we defined a visibility @xmath96 ( in analogy to spectroscopy ) reflecting the phase coherence of the condensate .",
    "@xmath96 is close to @xmath97 for perfect coherence , whereas @xmath98 for an incoherent condensate .",
    "the second observable we defined , was the width @xmath99 of a gaussian fit to the interference pattern integrated _ along _ the lattice direction over the extent of one of the peaks ( see fig .",
    "[ peaks ] ( b ) and ( d ) ) .    in",
    "@xcite we measured @xmath96 and @xmath99 as a function of the final quasimomentum value reached for different values of the acceleration .",
    "figure  [ instability ] shows clearly that for large accelerations , both @xmath96 and @xmath99 remained reasonably stable when the edge of the brillouin zone is crossed .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath56 one sees a drastic change in both quantities as the quasimomentum approaches the value @xmath100 . for those accelerations",
    ", the condensate spent a sufficiently long time in the bz unstable region and hence lost its phase coherence , resulting in a sharp drop of the visibility .",
    "at the same time , the radial width of the interference pattern increased .",
    "this increase is evidence for an instability in the transverse directions . for @xmath56 ,",
    "the interference patterns for quasimomenta larger than unity were so diffuse that it was not possible to measure either the visibility or the radial width in a meaningful way .    in  @xcite we estimated an instability growth rate of @xmath101 from the time spent by the condensate in the unstable region of the brillouin zone .",
    "this experimental value agrees with the theoretical prediction of @xmath102 estimated by niu  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite carried out an experiment for operating conditions similar to those of our investigations , but measured the effect of the instability through the atom loss rate from the condensate .",
    "they reported atom loss rates in the range @xmath103 .",
    "although it is not clear how to link the atom loss rate to the instability growth rate , the qualitative agreement ( i.e. the dependence of both quantities on the quasimomentum ) between their experimental results and their theory is good .",
    "their experiment was subsequently simulated by modugno _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who predicted growth rates of the unstable modes in the range @xmath104 . in that work",
    "the growth rate is expressed in units of the transverse magnetic trap frequency .",
    "this choice could be interpreted as meaning that the instability depends on the radial modes .",
    "it has , however , been clarified by one of the authors of that paper  @xcite that this is not the case and that the choice of the transverse frequency as the frequency unit was made purely for reasons of convenience .",
    "in fact , the dependence of the growth rate on the transverse frequency needs to be studied in more depth .",
    "we should point out that all the theoretical analyses predict the occurrence of the instabilities at the microscopic level only , while the experimental observations reflect the macroscopic changes of the condensate features , for instance the visibility in our case or the atom loss rate in the case of  @xcite .",
    "we compared our experimental results to a simple 1-d numerical simulation .",
    "figure  [ instab_theo ] shows the results of a numerical integration of the one - dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation with the parameters of our experiment .",
    "the visibility was calculated in the same way as was done for the experimental interference patterns .",
    "it is clear from this simulation that it is , indeed , the nonlinearity that is responsible for the instability at the edge of the brillouin zone .",
    "when @xmath67 was set to @xmath105 in the numerical simulation , the visibility remains unaltered when the bz edge is crossed , whereas for finite values of @xmath67 the visibility decreases as the quasimomentum @xmath100 was approached .",
    "furthermore , the larger the value of @xmath67 , the more pronounced was the decrease in visibility near the band edge .",
    "for @xmath106 , corresponding to the value realized in our experiment , the onset of the instability was located just below a quasimomentum of @xmath107 .",
    "experimentally , we found that the visibility started decreasing consistently beyond a quasimomentum of @xmath108 , agreeing reasonably well with the results of the simulation .",
    "the presence of experimental points with visibility less than unity in the quasimomentum region below @xmath109 can be explained by considering the initial sloshing of the condensate inside the harmonic trap .",
    "this oscillation introduced a sensitive error in the quasimomentum determination which was estimated to be of the order of @xmath110 .",
    "the determination of the quasimomentum corresponding to the onset of instability is a subject that has been examined in the literature , and in a recent experimental investigation the quasimomentum scanning across the brillouin zone was stopped at different values in order to verify the instability growth  @xcite .",
    "our measured values for the instability onset are in agreement with those measured in that reference .",
    "we have numerically simulated and experimentally studied the dynamics of a bose einstein condensate inside a periodic potential in two different regimes . in the landau - zener regime , we investigated the tunneling between two energy bands in a periodic potential and found that , in the presence of a nonlinear interaction term , an asymmetry in the tunneling rates arises .",
    "experimentally , we measured these tunneling rates for different values of the interaction parameter and found qualitative agreement with the simulations . in the instability regime , we studied the stability of a bec in the vicinity of the band edge , finding good agreement between experimental results and the theoretical expectation of unstable behavior .",
    "these observations confirmed that bose - einstein condensates may be used to simulate a variety of nonlinear physics configurations .",
    "future experiments could probe the complicated and time - dependent tunneling behaviour due to the changing tunneling rate for multiple crossings of the zone edge .    to conclude",
    ", we note that the phenomenon of asymmetric tunneling should be a rather general feature of quantum systems exhibiting a nonlinearity .",
    "for instance , calculating the energy shift due to a nonlinearity for two adjacent levels of a harmonic oscillator , one finds that both levels are shifted upwards in energy , the shift being proportional to the population of the respective level .",
    "the energy difference between the levels , therefore , decreases if only the lower state is populated and increases if all the population is in the upper level .",
    "furthermore the asymmetric landau - zener tunneling rate was applied to intepret the photoassociation of a bose - einstein condensate  @xcite , with the surprising result that at small crossing rates the no - transition probability is directly proportional to the rate at which the resonance is crossed .",

    "<S> we present our experimental investigations on the subject of dynamical nonlinearity - induced instabilities and of nonlinear landau - zener tunneling between two energy bands in a rubidium bose - einstein condensate in an accelerated periodic potential . </S>",
    "<S> these two effects may be considered two different regimes ( for small and large acceleration ) of the same physical system and studied with the same experimental protocol . </S>",
    "<S> nonlinearity introduces an asymmetry in landau - zener tunneling ; as a result , tunneling from the ground state to the excited state is enhanced whereas in the opposite direction it is suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> when the acceleration is lowered , the condensate exhibits an unstable behaviour due to nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> we also carried out a full numerical simulation of both regimes integrating the full gross - pitaevskii equation ; for the landau - zener effect we also used a simple two - level model . in both cases we found good agreement with the experimental results </S>"
