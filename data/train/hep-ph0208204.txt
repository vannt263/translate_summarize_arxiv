    "the inclusive @xmath5 mode was measured to have a branching fraction of @xmath6 .",
    "branching ratios of exclusive radiative channels are measured to be @xmath7 and @xmath8 whereas for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 decays so far only upper limits exist @xcite .    whereas the inclusive mode can be computed perturbatively using the heavy - quark expansion , for the exclusive channels bound state effects have to be taken into account .",
    "the basic mechanisms for the exclusive radiative decays were already discussed by various groups @xcite .",
    "however , they all had to use hadronic models which do not allow a clear separation of short- and long - distance dynamics and a clean distinction of model - dependent and model - independent features .",
    "yet , a systematic and model - independent analysis of exclusive radiative decays is possible in the heavy quark limit @xmath2 .",
    "the relevant hadronic matrix elements of local operators in the weak hamiltonian simplify in this limit because perturbatively calculable hard scattering kernels can be separated from nonperturbative form factors and universal light - cone distribution amplitudes .",
    "a power counting in @xmath11 implies a hierarchy among the possible transition mechanisms and allows to identify leading and subleading contributions .",
    "in particular , effects from quark loops are calculable rather than being generic , uncalculable long - distance contributions .",
    "our approach is similar in spirit to the treatment of hadronic matrix elements in two - body non - leptonic @xmath3 decays formulated by beneke , buchalla , neubert , and sachrajda @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for @xmath5 transitions reads @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the relevant operators are the current - current operators @xmath15 , the qcd - penguin operators @xmath16 , and the electro- and chromomagnetic penguin operators @xmath17",
    ". the effective hamiltonian for @xmath18 is obtained from ( [ heff ] ) by the replacement @xmath19 .",
    "the most difficult step in computing the @xmath12 decay amplitudes is the evaluation of the hadronic matrix elements of the operators in ( [ heff ] ) . in the heavy - quark limit",
    "a systematic treatment of the hadronic matrix elements is possible . in this case",
    "the following factorization formula @xcite is valid @xmath20 \\!\\cdot\\epsilon \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the photon polarization 4-vector . here",
    "@xmath22 is a @xmath23 transition form factor , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 are leading twist light - cone distribution amplitudes of the @xmath3 meson and the vector meson @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "these quantities are universal , nonperturbative objects .",
    "they describe the long - distance dynamics of the matrix elements , which is factorized from the perturbative , short - distance interactions expressed in the hard - scattering kernels @xmath27 and @xmath28 . to leading order in qcd and leading power in the heavy - quark limit",
    ", @xmath29 gives the only contribution to the @xmath12 amplitude . at @xmath30",
    "the operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 start contributing and the factorization formula becomes nontrivial .",
    "the relevant diagrams for the nlo hard - vertex corrections @xmath33 were computed in @xcite to get the virtual corrections to the matrix elements for the inclusive @xmath5 mode at next - to - leading order .",
    "we re - interpret these results as the perturbative type i hard - scattering kernels for the exclusive process . as required for the consistency of the factorization formula , these contributions are dominated by hard scales @xmath34 and are hence infrared finite .",
    "we now turn to the mechanism where the spectator participates in the hard scattering .",
    "the non - vanishing contributions to @xmath28 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qit2 ] .",
    "= 7.5truecm    we can express both the type i and type ii contributions to the matrix elements @xmath35 in terms of the matrix element @xmath36 , an explicit factor @xmath37 , and hard - scattering functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 which are given explicitely in @xcite .",
    "the total @xmath40 amplitude then can be written as @xmath41\\langle v\\gamma|q_7|\\bar b\\rangle\\ ] ] where the factorization coefficients @xmath42 consist of the wilson coefficient @xmath43 and the contributions from the type i and type ii hard - scattering corrections .",
    "we get a sizeable enhancement of the leading order value , dominated by the @xmath44-type correction .",
    "the net enhancement of @xmath45 at nlo leads to a corresponding enhancement of the branching ratios , for fixed value of the form factor .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bkrhomu ] ,    where we show the residual scale dependence for @xmath46 and @xmath47 at leading and next - to - leading order .",
    "a complex phase is generated at nlo which leads to a non - vanishing value of the cp asymmetry @xmath48 it is of @xmath49 for the @xmath50 mode with the largest theoretical uncertainty coming from the scale dependence .",
    "the cp asymmetry is with @xmath51 very small for the @xmath5 transition because of the large ckm hierarchy @xmath52 .",
    "a further interesting observable is the charge averaged isospin breaking ratio @xmath53 where @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 . within our approximations ,",
    "isospin breaking is generated by weak annihilation contributions .",
    "they are power suppressed but can nevertheless be computed within qcd factorization because the colour - transparency argument applies to the emitted , highly energetic vector meson in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "isospin breaking was already discussed in @xcite , partially including nlo corrections .",
    "kagan and neubert found a large effect from the penguin operator @xmath58 on the isospin asymmetry @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "this brings the prediction @xmath60 within the large error bars in rather good agreement with the experimental value @xmath61 @xcite . for @xmath9",
    "we find a strong dependence of the isospin asymmetry on the angle @xmath62 of the unitarity triangle .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : isodelta ] .    a measurement of the isospin asymmetry @xmath63 can therefore give valuable indirect information on the ckm angle @xmath62 .",
    "the double radiative @xmath10 modes realize the exceptional situation of nontrivial qcd dynamics related to the decaying @xmath3 in combination with a completely nonhadronic final state and simple two - body kinematics . as the two - photon system can be in a cp - even or cp - odd state we can study direct cp - violating effects .    in the heavy - quark limit we get a factorization formula @xcite for the hadronic matrix elements of the operators in the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) : @xmath64 because there are no hadrons in the final state only one type of hard - scattering kernel @xmath65 ( type ii or hard - spectator contribution ) enters the factorization formula . to leading power in @xmath11 and in the leading logarithmic approximation of qcd",
    "only one diagram contributes to the amplitude for @xmath10 .",
    "it is the one - particle reducible ( 1pr ) diagram with the electromagnetic penguin operator @xmath29 , where the second photon is emitted from the @xmath66-quark line .",
    "the result for both the cp - even and cp - odd amplitude is @xmath67 where @xmath68 parametrizes the first negative moment of the @xmath3 meson wave function . in the present approximation the strong - interaction matrix elements multiplying @xmath69 and @xmath70 are identical and have no relative phase . for the strictly leading - power result we therefore get no direct cp violation .",
    "subleading contributions come for example from the 1pr diagram , where the second photon is emitted from the @xmath71 quark line .",
    "this and other subleading effects in @xmath36 , however , contribute equally to the up- and charm - quark components of the amplitude and therefore do not affect direct cp violation .",
    "the one - particle irreducible diagrams ( 1pi ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:1pi ] ,    on the other hand , provide the basic effects responsible for a difference between the up- and charm - quark sectors of the amplitude , including rescattering phases . although power - suppressed they are calculable in qcd factorization .",
    "we then get a non - vanishing cp asymmetry already at @xmath72 .",
    "the effect for @xmath73 is again negligible whereas the direct cp asymmetry for @xmath74 is approximately @xmath75 .",
    "however , we do not expect these cp asymmetries to be measured in the near future because of the tiny branching ratios .",
    "we predict @xmath76 and @xmath77 which are both roughly two orders of magnitude below the current experimental upper limits .",
    "the large uncertainty in our prediction comes from the poorly known hadronic parameter @xmath78 .",
    "we have presented a systematic and model - independent framework for the rare radiative decays @xmath12 and @xmath10 based on the heavy - quark limit @xmath2 .",
    "quark - loop contributions are calculable in qcd factorization rather than being uncalculable long - distance effects .",
    "non - factorizable long - distance corrections may still exist , but they are power - suppressed .",
    "strong interaction phases from both hard - vertex and hard - spectator contributions are calculable and important for cp - violating observables .",
    "we have seen that weak - annihilation amplitudes in @xmath12 are power - suppressed but numerically enhanced and calculable .",
    "we used them to estimate isospin breaking effects .",
    "our nlo predictions for the central values of the @xmath12 branching ratios are @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "they are substantially larger than the leading logarithmic values when the same form factors are used .",
    "the dominant uncertainty comes from the variation of the nonperturbative input parameters , most notably from the @xmath23 form factors .",
    "this situation , however , can be systematically improved . in particular",
    ", our approach allows for a consistent perturbative matching of the form factor to the short - distance part of the amplitude .",
