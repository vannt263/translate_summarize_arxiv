    "the interface between epitaxial graphene and bulk sic plays a dominant role in both the growth and transport properties of graphene on sic.@xcite for reasons not understood , graphene growth on the @xmath0 ( c - face ) is much faster than growth on the @xmath3 ( si - face).@xcite nonetheless , it is widely recognized that the diffusion of si through the two different sic - graphene interfaces is responsible for these different graphene growth kinetics.@xcite in addition to playing an important role in growth , the chemical nature of the interface has a dramatic effect on electron transport in monolayer graphene . just like in growth ,",
    "transport on the si - face is different than on the c - face .",
    "mobilities are nearly an order of magnitude higher on c - face graphene compared to si - face graphene even though the structural quality of the films are apparently identical.@xcite    the ability to understand and control the sic - graphene interface will be a necessary step on the road to graphene electronics .",
    "indeed work has already begun in this direction .",
    "previous work on the si - face of sic has shown that ge@xcite and interfacial metals@xcite can influence the charge transfer from the sic to the graphene .",
    "similarly , @xmath4 absorption has been shown to both neutralize the charge transfer and cause the buffer layer to become isolated from the sic interface.@xcite these intercalants can cause substantial changes to the transport properties of the graphene . on the si - face , @xmath5 absorption at the interface can increase electron mobilities by 40%@xcite ( even higher mobilities are achieved if the samples are gated).@xcite    in this work we present data showing that large amounts of si can be intercalated into the graphene - sic interface by annealing si deposited at the graphene - vacuum interface .",
    "intercalation proceeds through heterogeneous sites@xcite in the graphene film beginning at @xmath6@xmath1and becomes very rapid by 1020@xmath1 .",
    "this process offers potentially new avenues to modify the graphene - sic interface structure for new device geometries .",
    "the substrate used in these studies was an n - doped ( @xmath7 ) 6h - sic .",
    "the sample was grown in a closed rf induction furnace using the controlled silicon sublimation ( css ) method at 1550@xmath1for 20 min.@xcite the sample was transported in air before introduction into the uhv analysis chamber . prior to leem / xpeem measurements",
    "the graphene films were thermally annealed at 500@xmath1 in uhv .",
    "leem / peem measurements were performed at the i311-peem beam line at the maxlab synchrotron radiation laboratory .",
    "arpes and xps measurements were made at the cassiope beamline at the soleil synchrotron in gif sur yvette .",
    "the high resolution cassiope beamline is equipped with a modified petersen pgm monochromator with a resolution @xmath8 at 100 ev and 25000 for lower energies .",
    "the detector is a @xmath9 acceptance scienta r4000 detector with resolution @xmath10mev and @xmath11 at @xmath12 ev .",
    "the total measured instrument resolution is @xmath13mev .",
    "the si was deposited using direct current heating of a si wafer at 1150@xmath1 .",
    "the si deposition rate was calibrated in three ways to check for consistency : ( i ) using the si vapor pressure and the deposition geometry , ( ii ) using the measured si 2p intensity for multiple depositions assuming a layer by layer growth and ( iii ) measuring the attenuation of the graphene - c 1s peak intensity before and after si deposition .",
    "all three ways gave a deposition rate of @xmath14 ml/10 min .",
    "we have performed a series of si deposition experiments on top of a 2 ml graphene region of the graphene film using xpeem .",
    "the 2 ml region was identified using hibino et al s method of leem reflectivity oscillations.@xcite the insert in fig .",
    "[ f : sixps ] shows the si 2p core level spectra from the as - grown sample .",
    "we have fit the spectra with a spin orbit split si 2p peak ( s2 ) and a second peak at higher binding energy ( hbe ) we associate with a sic shifted surface state similar to the one observed for the clean sic @xmath15 surface.@xcite the hbe peak forms after the first anneal and remains after further deposit and anneal cycles .",
    "when 1.4 ml of si is evaporated at room temperature onto the 2 ml graphene , the si 2p peak is larger and shifted 1.4ev to lower binding energy ( be ) . annealing to 970@xmath1does",
    "not significantly affect the spectrum .",
    "however , after a 10 sec anneal to 1020@xmath1 , the si 2p intensity shifts 0.22ev to higher be and decreases in intensity ( see fig .",
    "[ f : sixps ] ) . there are four possible explanations for this apparent loss of si : ( i ) evaporation of @xmath16 ml of si from the surface , ( ii ) diffusion of a similar amount of si to heterogeneous defect sites where 3d si can nucleate ( these sites can not be underneath the photon beam ) , ( iii ) intercalation of si into the graphene , or ( iv ) diffusion of si to the graphene - sic interface . in cases ( i ) and ( ii ) the intensity decrease is simply si leaving the probe area , while in cases ( iii ) and ( iv ) the si 2p intensity decrease is caused by the electron mean free path that attenuates the photoelectron signal .",
    "as we will now show , si intercalation into the graphene - sic interface accounts for most of the lost intensity .    for 10sec .",
    "the insert shows an expanded view of the graphitized spectra before si deposition .",
    "the photon energy was @xmath17ev .",
    "solid lines are the fit peaks and background.,width=264 ]    significant si evaporation can be immediately ruled out because the si evaporation rate at 1020@xmath1can account for a loss of no more than @xmath18 ml .",
    "more importantly , once the intensity has dropped after the first anneal , additional heating at the same temperature has no further effect on the si 2p intensity ( see fig .",
    "[ f:60min ] ) .",
    "this means that after the initial anneal , the si distribution remains stable .",
    "this stability also rules out substantial diffusion to heterogeneous sites .",
    "some si does initially diffuses to heterogeneous sites,@xcite but the fact that further annealing at the same temperature does not change the si 2p intensity indicates that this type of material flow quickly becomes negligable .",
    "( blue dots ) , and after an additional 10sec anneal at 1020@xmath1(red open circles ) . the small shift of peak following the second anneal may results from work function change.,width=264 ]    we performed three similar si deposit and anneal cycles .",
    "after each anneal , the si 2p peak drops from its initial deposition value and remains stable with additional annealing to 1020@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , after each deposition and anneal cycle , the si 2p intensity is larger than in the previous cycle . in other words",
    "the post - annealed stable si concentration is building up within the @xmath19 m area probed by the xpeem .",
    "this buildup is either as si intercalation between graphene sheets or si accumulating at the graphene - sic interface .",
    "we point out that none of the si is intercalated between graphene sheets .",
    "this can be demonstrated by using @xmath20-leed and taking advantage of the unique stacking of c - face graphene .",
    "c - face graphene consists of sheets that are commensurately rotated with non - bernal angles ( i.e not @xmath21).@xcite this stacking leads to graphene super cells that can be seen in stm.@xcite because there are many rotational pairs in a typical leed beam diameter and because the amplitude of the supercell vertical displacements are small ( @xmath22nm),@xcite typical leed patterns from the super cells are averaged over multiple weak patters to produce a diffuse background .    leed image at 96ev from 6h c - face graphene . the leed image is from the same 2 ml region where the si 2p data in figs .",

    "the cell corresponds to a @xmath23 reconstruction.,width=302 ]    using @xmath20-leed , we have selected a sub micron region of the sample to observe the supercell structure before and after si annealing .",
    "the @xmath24leed image from the 2-layer region before si deposition is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : leed ] .",
    "the image shows a pattern that consists of the diffraction pattern from two vertically stacked but rotated graphene layers , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , plus a superstructure pattern .",
    "the two graphene sheets are commensurately rotated by @xmath27 .",
    "this commensurate angle gives rise to the supercell that can be used to index all the superlattice spots ( see insert in fig .",
    "[ f : leed ] ) .",
    "the supercell in this region corresponds to @xmath23 in graphene units .",
    "the superstructure is not due to adsorbates since the structure persists up to at least 1100@xmath1 .    even after annealing 7 ml of si",
    ", there is no effect on the superstructure pattern .",
    "if si intercalated between graphene sheets , the large change in the interlayer spacing caused by inserting si between graphene would destroy the small corrugation superlattice . after ruling out the other sources of the lost si 2p intensity , we are left with the conclusion that after annealing , the majority of the deposited si is incorporated between the sic interface and the first graphene layer .    the most direct evidence that significant si intercalates into the sic - graphene interface comes from leed and xps measurements .",
    "figure [ f : leed_comp ] shows the leed pattern from two parts of the same sample after more than 7 ml of si was deposited and subsequently annealed at 1020@xmath1 . the image in fig .  [",
    "f : leed_comp](a ) is from the covered part of the sample were no si was deposited .",
    "this is a typical leed pattern from multilayer graphitized sic .",
    "it shows both the graphene ring and , because the sample is thin , the diffraction pattern from the @xmath28 sic surface .",

    "f : leed_comp](a ) or uniformly attenuated .",
    "instead only the sic spots have disappeared .",
    "this demonstrates that a significant portion of the deposited si has diffused to the sic - graphene interface where it attenuates the diffraction pattern from the sic , leaving the graphene pattern unchanged .",
    "pattern in ( a ) is not visible in ( b ) .",
    "both images were made at 72ev.,width=340 ]    a similar effect is seen in the c1s spectra before and after si intercalation .",
    "figure [ f : xps_after ] shows that the c 1s signal from the sic carbon disappears from the spectra after intercalation . the interface si has attenuated the sic carbon signal relative to the graphene carbon c 1s photoelectron intensity .",
    "there is no evidence that the si converts any significant amount of graphene to sic at the 1020@xmath1annealing temperature .",
    "figure [ f : step](a ) show an xpeem map using the si 2p core level intensity .",
    "because of photoelectron attenuation , image contrast is proportional to graphene thickness ( lighter areas are thinner ) . figure [ f : step](b ) shows a cut through a 2-,3-,4- , and 2-layer graphene region of the sample before and after si deposit and annealing .",
    "the plot shows that after si has moved to the sic - graphene interface , neither the graphene boundaries nor thicknesses are changing , i.e , there is no measurable conversion of graphene to sic .",

    "we use a model that assumes that most of the si is uniformly distributed both at the surface and at the sic interface .",
    "leem mirror mode images , which are sensitive to height variations on the surface , show no significant height variation after annealing .",
    "since si 3d islands on scales larger than the 10 nm resolution of the microscope would be visible as surface height fluctuation , we can rule out large scale si - island formation .",
    "we also allow a fraction of the si to bind to c sites on the last graphene layer . we know that a stable si complex is at the surface because it oxidizes when exposed to air ( see fig .",

    "after each anneal , @xmath35 layers are evaporated , @xmath36 layers have moved to the sic interface and the remaining @xmath37 are bound at the graphene - vacuum interface . as discussed above , the model does not include intercalation of si between graphene layers .",
    "the total si intercalated into the sic interface is @xmath38 .",
    "the measured si 2p photo - electron current after annealing , @xmath39 , has contributions from : ( i ) the si at the graphene - sic interface that is attenuated by both the si within the layer and the graphene above it , and ( ii ) the total si at the graphene - vacuum boundary .",
    "the intensity before annealing , @xmath40 , depends essentially on the amount of si deposited because the surface si and the graphene effectively attenuate any signal from the si at the sic interface .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption because the electron mean free paths in graphene and si ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively ) are small at the kinetic energies used in these experiments ( see below ) .    assuming that the si 2p cross section is the same regardless of how it is bound , we can write the relative intensity change after each anneal , @xmath43 , as ;    [ eq : model ] @xmath44 \\label{eq : model_1}\\ ] ] @xmath45(1-e^{-d_{si}/\\lambda_{si}})}}{{(1+[n_{2}+n_{1b}-1]e^{-d_{si}/\\lambda_{si } } ) } } \\label{eq : model_2}\\ ] ] @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the bulk si and graphene interlayer spacing , respectively . in eq .",

    "this is done by assuming the si film has a uniform bulk si density and the sic is a bulk terminated surface . assuming the photo - electron production cross - section is the same in both layers , we estimate @xmath51 . for comparison the mean free path in sic is 3.2.@xcite we have used both values in the coverage calculations .",

    "the reason the si intercalates is not known . however , at 1020@xmath1 , the sic phase diagram predicts that any excess si will stay segregated .",
    "since the excess si has the choice of wetting either the graphene at the vacuum boundary or wetting both the graphene and the carbon rich sic interface , the lower energy choice is intercalation between the sic and graphene . from an equilibrium view point , the excess si should bond with the excess carbon ( in the form of graphene ) to form a new stable sic layer . the fact that it does not , indicates that either the surface phase diagram allows both an excess si and c phase or there is an appreciable kinetic barrier to sic formation .",
