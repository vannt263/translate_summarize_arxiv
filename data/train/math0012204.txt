    "a celebrated theorem of blind and mani  @xcite states that the combinatorial type of any simple polytope  @xmath2 is determined by the isomorphism class of its abstract vertex - edge graph  @xmath1 .",
    "kalai  @xcite gave a short and very elegant proof of this result .",
    "the proof is constructive , but the algorithm that can be derived from it has a worst - case running time which is exponential in the size of  @xmath1 ( for computational experiments see achatz and kleinschmidt  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the complexity status of the problem of reconstructing the combinatorial type of a simple polytope from its graph remains unclear .",
    "kalai s proof is based on an ingenious characterization of the shellings of the boundary of the dual polytope  @xmath5 .",

    "such a linear ordering of the vertices is called an _ abstract objective function _ , while the corresponding orientation is an _ aof - orientation_. abstract objective functions generalize linear objective functions in general position . the crucial step in kalai s proof",
    "is the characterization of aof - orientations as those acyclic orientations of  @xmath1 which minimize a certain integer - valued function  @xmath7 .",
    "its minimum value is the total number of non - empty faces of  @xmath2 .",
    "we consider a refinement of the function @xmath8 as a sum of  @xmath9 functions @xmath10 .",

    "our main result on @xmath0-systems ( theorem  [ thm : hksum ] ) is that on the one hand , a @xmath0-system of the graph of  @xmath2 with maximal cardinality is the set of subgraphs induced by the @xmath0-faces of  @xmath2 , and on the other hand , there is a strong dual relation between the cardinality of @xmath0-systems and the function  @xmath12 . from this relationship polynomially sized proofs ( certificates ) for the fact that a set of vertex sets indeed is the set of vertex sets of the @xmath0-faces",

    "corollary  [ cor : hksum ] yields a good characterization of  @xmath20 among all sets of subsets of vertices of a simple polytope  @xmath2 ( given by its graph ) in the sense of edmonds  @xcite : for every subset  @xmath27 of vertex sets of  @xmath2 one can efficiently prove the answer to the question `` is  @xmath45 ?

    "since the number of facets of a simple @xmath11-polytope  @xmath2 is bounded by a polynomial in the size of  @xmath1 , corollary  [ cor : hksum ] also implies that the question whether a given single subset of vertices is the vertex set of some facet of  @xmath2 has a good characterization .    it had been hoped for a long time that such good characterizations ( for @xmath65 ) would be obtained by an eventual proof of a conjecture due to perles . already in  1970",

    "this would even imply much more than good characterizations : it would immediately yield polynomial time algorithms to decide whether a set of vertices is the vertex set of a facet , and whether a subset of sets of vertices is  @xmath59 .",

    "are two distinct sinks in  @xmath23 as well .",
    "it is not too hard to find examples showing that there is no analogue of theorem  [ thm:2faces ] for  @xmath0-faces with @xmath95 .",
    "theorem  [ thm:2faces ] thus shows that the @xmath3-faces of a simple polytope  @xmath2 play a distinguished role with respect to the aof - orientations of  @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth noticing that computing  @xmath31 from  @xmath1 is polynomial time equivalent to computing  @xmath59 from  @xmath1 . to see this",

    "thus , instead of considering the problem of computing  @xmath59 from  @xmath1 one may rather consider the problem of computing  @xmath31 from  @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath3-faces are polygons and thus have a simpler structure than the facets , in general .",
    "moreover , they also bear strong connections to the aof - orientations as stated in theorem  [ thm:2faces ] .",
    "a good characterization , as provided by corollary  [ cor : hksum ] , often indicates that the corresponding ( decision ) problem  @xmath99 ( given the graph  @xmath1 of a simple polytope  @xmath2 and a @xmath0-system  @xmath27 of  @xmath1 ; is  @xmath45 ? ) can be solved in polynomial time .",
    "in fact , there are many examples of combinatorial optimization problems , for which such a good characterization has guided the algorithm design ( primal - dual algorithms ) . in the theory of computational complexity , this corresponds to the fact that for most problems which are known to be contained in the complexity class @xmath100 it is even known that they belong to the class  @xmath101 of problems solvable in polynomial time ( the most prominent exception is the problem of deciding whether an integer number is a prime ) .",
    "unfortunately , corollary  [ cor : hksum ] does not imply that problem  @xmath99 is contained in @xmath100 , since it is unknown if one can prove resp .",
    "disprove efficiently that a given graph is ( isomorphic to ) the graph of some simple @xmath11-polytope .",
    "this question is closely related to the steinitz problem , the problem to decide whether a given lattice is ( isomorphic to ) the face - lattice of some polytope ( with real - algebraic coordinates ) .",
    "the steinitz problem is known to be @xmath102-hard even in dimension four  ( theorem  9.1.2 in  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , again already in dimension four , there is no polynomial certificate for the steinitz problem by specifying coordinates  ( theorem  9.3.3 in  @xcite ) .",
    "this can be interpreted as indications for the non - existence of a good characterization for the `` integrity '' of the input data of problem  @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the good characterization of  corollary  [ cor : hksum ] seems to have no direct complexity theoretical implications .",
    "nevertheless , it might be encouraging or even be exploited for the design of a polynomial time algorithm for problem  @xmath99 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : hksum ] shows that for solving problem  @xmath99 in polynomial time it would suffice to design a polynomial time method for computing  @xmath103 from  @xmath1 .",
    "one way to achieve this could be a polynomial time method for finding any aof - orientation of  @xmath1 .",
    "however , it is not even known whether there is a polynomial time algorithm for finding an aof of a simple @xmath11-polytope  @xmath2 given by its entire face - lattice ( not even for  @xmath104 ) .",
    "equivalently , there is no polynomial time algorithm known that finds a shelling of an abstract simplicial complex of which one knows that it is isomorphic to the boundary complex of a simplicial polytope .",
    "thus , an interesting question is the one for alternative ways to calculate  @xmath103 from  @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , it might be easier to find a polynomial algorithm that finds an acyclic orientation of  @xmath1 which has only one sink per @xmath0-face , from which one would obtain  @xmath103 as well .",
    "these considerations concern the problem of deciding whether a set of candidates actually is the set  @xmath59 of vertex sets of facets ( or , more generally , of @xmath0-faces ) of a simple polytope  @xmath2 specified by its graph  @xmath1 .",
    "the genuine question , however , is whether there is a polynomial time algorithm for finding  @xmath59 from  @xmath1 .",
    "corollary  [ cor : maxksystem ] shows that one can phrase this problem as a maximization problem .",
