    "the steady - state tensor virial theorem ( see e.g. chandrasekhar 1987 ) relates the overall geometry of the matter distribution to the global kinematics . it is a global result that constrains the components of the pressure , kinetic energy and potential energy tensors",
    "the potential energy tensor @xmath8 depends on the flattening , whilst the kinetic energy tensor @xmath9 describes the rotational and velocity anisotropy properties .",
    "stars and their kinematics provide one of the tools available for studies of the morphologies and sizes of galaxies and their halos .",
    "so , a classic application of the tensor virial theorem is to the problem of the shape of elliptical and lenticular galaxies .",
    "binney ( 1978 , 2005 ) gave a pictorial representation of the plane of ellipticity @xmath10 versus ratio of rotational to pressure support @xmath11 for early - type galaxies .",
    "he showed that if elliptical galaxies have isodensity surfaces that are similar ellipsoids , then @xmath11 is completely determined by the velocity anisotropy and the flattening .",
    "this diagram is an important tool in understanding whether the flattening of an elliptical galaxy is due to velocity anisotropy or rotation .",
    "although the tensor virial theorem has been widely used in galactic astronomy , applications have been largely confined to self - gravitating systems  such as the stars in bulges or elliptical galaxies  which are moving in a potential mainly generated by their own density field .",
    "however , some populations make a very modest contribution to the total potential in which they move .",
    "an example is the population of metal - poor halo stars , which are mere tracers of the gravity field of the overwhelmingly dominant dark halo .",
    "similarly , the stars of the thick disc move in the combined field of the more massive thin disc and dark halo .",
    "we shall refer to such instances as _",
    "tracer populations_. here , we provide a systematic investigation of the tensor virial theorem applied to tracers , including stellar haloes and thick discs .",
    "conventional methods of analysis of stellar kinematical data on tracer populations are usually based upon phase space distribution functions ( e.g , evans , hafner & de zeeuw 1997 , deason , evans & belokurov 2011a ) or upon the jeans equations ( e.g. , van der marel 1991 , battaglia et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the former is most fundamental as it is equivalent to solving the collisionless boltzmann equation .",
    "the method usually depends upon an ansatz as to the likely phase space distribution function , with the free parameters fit in a maximum likelihood sense to the kinematical data .",
    "the latter is less fundamental , as the jeans equations are moments of the collisionless boltzmann equation .",
    "the method depends not just on the stellar density and velocity field , but also explicitly on their gradients , which are hard to obtain with noisy data and susceptible to deviations caused by contaminants , interlopers and substructure .",
    "the tensor virial theorem is obtained by integration of moments of the jeans equations , and so can be regarded as a globally averaged version of them .",
    "although there are earlier attempts to use the tensor virial theorem to study properties of the galaxy via the kinematics of tracer stars in the literature ( white 1989 , sommer - larsen & christensen 1989 ) , they were held up by a serious drawback .",
    "kinematic quantities , for example , of halo stars in our galaxy are only known locally , and there is a leap of faith required in extrapolating from local to global quantities .",
    "however , given the many large scale surveys of galactic stars underway or planned , it is now worthwhile to examine the tensor virial theorem anew for its potentiality .",
    "astrometric satellites such as gaia ( turon et al . 2005 ) , current spectroscopic surveys such as segue ( yanny et al . 2009 ) , and forthcoming initiatives , such as eso - gaia and hermes , offer the prospects of huge amounts of kinematic information becoming available for many stars throughout the galaxy .",
    "understanding these complex and overlapping datasets , and extracting useful information from the radial velocities and proper motions , will be a major task over the next few years .",
    "global averages like the tensor virial theorem may provide a quick way of extracting ready and accurate information on the structure of the galactic potential .    the paper is arranged as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce the tensor virial theorem .",
    "section 3 derives formulae for the ratio of equatorial to vertical pressure for scale - free tracer populations in spherical haloes . in section 4 ,",
    "we develop theorems that extend our results to the cases of flattened haloes and more general tracer populations .",
    "section 5 discusses applications to population ii stars in the stellar halo of the milky way . using observational data on the pressure ratio",
    ", we develop a new method of constraining the flattening of the dark halo .",
    "we also show that virial arguments impose strong constraints on multiple populations moving in the same potential and apply our arguments to recent claims of duality in the stellar halo .",
    "section 6 , discusses applications to the thick disc , in particular focusing on whether the observed kinematics and flattening are consistent with motion in a thin disc potential with short or long scalelength .",
    "finally , we revisit the stellar halo in section 7 , asking whether it is conceivable that the flattening to the potential provided by the thin disc alone reproduce the observed flattening and kinematics .",
    "let @xmath12 be the volume of our survey .",
    "for an all - sky survey like gaia , @xmath12 might be all space . however , this need not always be the case .    whatever the volume @xmath12 , the kinetic energy tensor @xmath13 is the sum @xmath14 , where @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the stellar density , whilst @xmath17 is the velocity field and @xmath18 is the velocity dispersion tensor . here , an overbar denotes an average over the velocity distribution so that @xmath19 we note that @xmath9 is the kinetic energy in ordered , rotational motion ( often negligible for stellar halos but substantial for thick discs ) , whilst @xmath20 is the pressure tensor .",
    "the potential energy tensor is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the gravitational potential .    to obtain the relationship between these tensors",
    ", we start from the steady - state jeans equations , which read @xmath23 multiplying by @xmath24 , integrating over the volume @xmath12 and making use of the divergence theorem gives the steady - state , tensor virial theorem ( e.g. , chandrasekhar 1987 , binney 1981 ) @xmath25 where the surface term is @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the bounding surface .",
    "if the integration volume @xmath12 is taken as all space , then the surface term can be discarded provided that the pressure @xmath28 falls off more quickly than @xmath29 .    for an axisymmetric density and potential , we will often find it convenient to use cylindrical polars ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "it is useful to sum up all the kinetic energy or pressures in the equatorial plane and refer to @xmath31 analogously , we can also introduce @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the great advantage of virial methods is that integrated quantities ( such as total kinetic energy of the stars in the survey volume ) can in general be evaluated robustly even with quite sparse data .",
    "a price to be paid is that the surface terms may not necessarily vanish and may have to be evaluated from the data .",
    "for the moment , the gravitational potential is assumed to be dominated by dark matter .",
    "the stars comprise a tracer population .",
    "this assumption is fine for stellar haloes which move in the dominating dark matter potential .",
    "for example , the milky way galaxy s stellar halo has a total mass of @xmath34 ( e.g. , bell et al . 2008 ) , which is four orders of magnitude smaller than the dark matter halo ( e.g. , watkins et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "let us take the potential to be spherically symmetric ( i.e. @xmath35 ) and the stellar density to be axisymmetric ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) .",
    "let the integration volume @xmath12 be over all space and let the surface terms vanish , so that the tensor virial theorem can be manipulated to yield : @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "the quantity @xmath39 is the ratio of the equatorial or in - plane kinetic energy to the vertical kinetic energy .",
    "stellar haloes are only weakly rotating ( e.g. , deason et al .",
    "2011a ) , so it is to fair to assume that there is no mean streaming motion ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "then , @xmath39 is the same as @xmath41 , the ratio of pressure in the equatorial to vertical directions . for an axisymmetric figure , it is natural to expect this to be intimately related to the flattening .      to begin with ,",
    "let us assume that the tracer density is scale - free and has the form @xmath42 where ( @xmath43 ) are spherical polars and @xmath44 is the power - law fall - off .",
    "formally , the scale - free density is non - integrable either at the origin or at infinity and so the virial quantities do not exist .",
    "nonetheless , their ratio is well - defined and given by @xmath45 as an illustration , we specialise to the case in which the tracer density is stratified on similar concentric spheroids as @xmath46 with ( @xmath47 ) familiar cylindrical polar coordinates . here , @xmath0 is the axis ratio of the equidensity contours , which is simply related to the ellipticity @xmath48 . the virial ratio eq  ( [ eq : scalefreea ] ) is @xmath49 which is independent of @xmath22    some simple and useful results can be obtained in the case of modest flattening , @xmath50 . using the shorthand @xmath51 , then taylor expansion yields @xmath52 \\cos^2 \\theta ) \\mathrm{d } \\theta \\over \\ds       \\int_0^\\pi \\sin \\theta \\cos^2 \\theta ( 1- \\half \\gamma [ q-1 ]      \\cos^2\\theta ) \\mathrm{d}\\theta}.    \\label{eq : cruxsimple}\\ ] ] we can get an expression for the vertical and horizontal pressure difference by making the definitions @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the total mass of the tracer population . the angled brackets therefore denote mass - weighted averages of the velocity dispersions",
    ". we can now recast eq  ( [ eq : cruxsimple ] ) as @xmath56 bearing in mind that @xmath57 , where @xmath10 is the ellipticity , we see that the fractional pressure excess is @xmath58 in other words , for a mildly flattened stellar halo with a given ellipticity and power - law density fall - off residing in a spherical dark halo , then @xmath59 we note that , when @xmath60 @xmath61 and hence @xmath0 tend to @xmath62 ( i.e. the stellar halo is spherically stratified ) , and vice - versa .",
    "this behaviour in the isotropic pressure limit is general for spherical dark matter haloes .    in the limit of extreme flattening , an asymptotic expansion of eq  ( [ eq : crux ] ) yields @xmath63 with @xmath64 being the beta function .",
    "stellar halo populations typically have @xmath65 and so the pressure ratio @xmath66 for high flattening .",
    "we will see later in section  [ sec : td ] how the presence of a thin disc alters this behaviour .",
    "is shown as a function of the flattening @xmath0 for stellar densities with fall - off @xmath67 ( blue ) , 3.5 ( green ) , 4 ( yellow ) , 4.5 ( red ) and 5 ( purple ) . the pre - factor of @xmath68 means that the vertical axis is @xmath69 and ensures that the ratio tends to unity as @xmath70 .",
    "the analytic form of these curves is given in eqs  ( [ eq : casem3 ] ) , ( [ eq : casem4 ] ) and ( [ eq : casem5 ] ) for @xmath67 , 4 and 5.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      in fact , the pressure ratio in eq  ( [ eq : crux ] ) is analytic in the case that power - law fall - off @xmath44 is an integer .",
    "it is helpful to have the exact expressions . for @xmath71 ,",
    "we find : @xmath72 for the case @xmath67 , we have : @xmath73 this formula is equivalent to one derived by white ( 1989 ) for populations orbiting in an isothermal sphere .",
    "the @xmath74 case has already been discussed by helmi ( 2008 ) .",
    "we find : @xmath75 like us , helmi assumes that the stellar halo is flattened and follows a scale - free power - law density , whilst the dark halo is spherical .",
    "in fact , helmi specialises to the particular case of a logarithmic potential generating an asymptotically flat rotation curve . to make progress",
    ", helmi makes an additional assumption , namely that the ratio of horizontal to vertical velocity dispersions @xmath76 does not depend on location .",
    "unfortunately , the final formula  equation ( 8) of helmi ( 2008 )  contains two mistakes .",
    "the first is computational , namely the integrals are incorrect .",
    "this can be seen by noting that , in the limit of a spherical stellar halo ( @xmath77 ) , the velocity dispersion tensor must become isotropic within helmi s set of assumptions , a fact that is contradicted by her formula .",
    "the second is more subtle and conceptual .",
    "the ratio @xmath76 between velocity dispersions in the @xmath78 and @xmath79 coordinates can not be considered uniform , once the density and potential profiles are already assigned : this additional assumption over - determines the problem .    for the @xmath80 case ,",
    "the result is exceptionally simple , namely @xmath81 the result is exact for arbitrary flattening .",
    "figure  [ fig : power ] shows the behaviour of @xmath82 valid for any spherical potential .",
    "it assumes a power - law profile for the stellar density stratified on similar concentric spheroids with axis ratio @xmath0 and with density fall - off @xmath83 varying between 3 ( lower curve ) and 5 ( upper curve ) .",
    "populations in the stellar halo typically fall off like @xmath29 or @xmath84 , though some variable star populations such as rr lyrae ( e.g. , watkins et al .",
    "2009 ) and miras ( e.g. , an et al . 2004 ) can fall off faster . as a general rule ,",
    "the faster the density fall - off , and the greater the flattening , then the larger the pressure excess needed to support the stellar distribution .      to make practical use of the virial formulae",
    ", we must find the connection between the pressure ratio and the velocity dispersions .",
    "this is straightforward if the velocity dispersion tensor is diagonal in cylindrical polar coordinates , namely @xmath85 if the velocity dispersion tensor is aligned in spherical polar coordinates  as is the case for halo stars ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "2009b )  then matters are more complicated .",
    "the diagonal components of the velocity dispersion tensor in cylindrical polar coordinates are now given by    [ eq : sigt]@xmath86    where @xmath87 is the anisotropy parameter , @xmath88 this means that @xmath89 if @xmath87 is constant , this simplifies to @xmath90",
    "if our formulae were restricted to spherical dark haloes , they would have limited applicability . here",
    ", we derive a remarkable theorem that extends our results to the case of flattened tracer populations in flattened dark haloes .",
    "let the tracer density and total potential satisfy the following requirements @xmath91 for some @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we say in this case that @xmath16 and @xmath22 are stratified on constant flattening surfaces .",
    "the above definition is equivalent to requiring that @xmath16 ( or @xmath22 ) be a symmetric function of @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( or @xmath94 ) .",
    "the most commonly used examples are spheroidal distributions , such as @xmath95 there are a number of popular halo models of this form , including binney s ( 1978 ) logarithmic potential and the power - law models ( evans 1993 , 1994 )",
    ". the dark matter density may be cored or cusped .",
    "the flattening , or the minor to major axis ratio , of the dark matter equipotentials @xmath1 is rounder than the dark matter isodensity contours .",
    "similarly , the spheroidal power - law densities with fall - off @xmath44 and axis ratio @xmath0 studied in the previous section belong to this class , though there are many other possibilities for the tracer density as well .    in what follows ,",
    "it is convenient to specialize to spheroidally stratified potentials with flattening @xmath1 .",
    "the tensor virial theorem becomes : @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "making the substitution @xmath98 writing @xmath99 and then dropping the primes , the integrals on the right - hand side of eq  ( [ eq : tvtrationew ] ) are converted into the exact form as those on the right - hand side of eq  ( [ eq : tvtratio ] ) , with the only change @xmath100 this means that all our preceding results for spherical haloes hold good in the flattened case , but with the replacement @xmath101 this considerably extends the scope of our earlier results .",
    "more formally , our theorem can be stated as follows .",
    "_ if the dark matter potential @xmath22 is homoeoidally stratified with flattening @xmath1 and the tracer density @xmath16 has a constant flattening @xmath0 , then the virial ratio @xmath102 depends on the two flattenings just through their ratio @xmath2 . _    as a corollary , for scale - free densities with constant flattening the virial ratios depend on @xmath2 and the power - law exponent , but _ not _ on the radial form of the potential , as already noticed for spherical potentials .",
    "this can be seen by using spherical polar coordinates and noting that the radial integrals ( containing @xmath22 ) factorize and cancel top and bottom .",
    "the angular integrals do depend on the density stratification and the behaviour of @xmath102 , and thence @xmath103 , is controlled by those : @xmath104 as a consequence , once a virial ratio has been computed for a spherical dark matter potential , the flattened analogue follows in a straightforward manner . providing the potential remains spheroidally stratified , any halo model such as isothermal or navarro - frenk - white ( 1998 ) or sersic ( 1963 ) is fine .",
    "this is an extension of a famous and elegant result from potential theory due to roberts ( 1962 ) , which states that ratios such as @xmath102 depends only on the axial ratios for homoeoidal distributions , and not on the radial profiles .",
    "the ratio @xmath102 does depend on the form of @xmath22 , if more complex profiles are prescribed , for example , accounting for the contribution of the stellar disc , or the differential flattening of the dark matter halo and the self - gravity of the stellar halo .",
    "however , although analytic progress is difficult for complex profiles , the relevant integrals are easily evaluated numerically .      as shown above",
    ", there is a class of test densities ( like scale - free ones ) yielding virial ratios that are independent of the radial behaviour of @xmath22 .",
    "similarly , we can ask whether there are potentials giving virial ratios that are independent of the radial stratification of @xmath16 .",
    "if a density and a potential belong to these classes and give the same virial ratios , we refer to them as _",
    "conjugate_. we shall demonstrate that scale - free potentials are conjugate to scale - free tracer densities .    consider a scale - free power - law potential describing the dark matter @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a constant .",
    "now , the circular velocity in the equatorial plane varies like @xmath107 .",
    "so models with @xmath108 have falling rotation curves , models with @xmath109 have rising rotation curves . when @xmath110 , the model is the familiar isothermal sphere with a perfectly flat rotation curve @xmath111 .",
    "now suppose that the tracer density has the form @xmath112 note that this density profile is not necessarily scale - free , but could be of exponential or gaussian form .",
    "then , the ratio of equatorial to vertical pressure is @xmath113^{3 + \\alpha } \\sin^3 \\theta      \\mathrm{d } \\theta \\over \\ds",
    "\\int_0^\\pi   [ h(\\theta)]^{3 +        \\alpha}\\sin \\theta \\cos^2 \\theta \\mathrm{d } \\theta}\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : scalefreeb}\\ ] ] but , this is the same virial ratio as would be given by @xmath114 with @xmath115 .",
    "the two combinations are conjugate .",
    "the conjugateness theorem then reads : _ a scale - free tracer density with fall - off @xmath116 in an arbitrary spherical potential is conjugate to a tracer density in a scale - free potential with fall - off @xmath106 .",
    "_ to give a practical application of this result , we might want to know the pressure ratio of a tracer population with @xmath117\\ ] ] in a galaxy with a flat rotation curve ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "the density law might describe a thick disc with horizontal scalelength @xmath118 and vertical scaleheight @xmath119 . by the conjugateness theorem ,",
    "this is just the same as the pressure ratio for a spheroidal population with @xmath120 , which is given in eq  (    [ eq : casem3 ] ) .",
    "we finally remark that , although the potential and the density may be chosen as scale - free , they can not both be so chosen as the virial ratios are then undefined .",
    "white s ( 1989 ) results for spheroidal tracer populations orbiting in the singular isothermal sphere hold good providing the core radius of the tracers @xmath121 does not vanish .",
    "sommer - larsen & christensen ( 1989 ) give formulae for the virial ratios of scale - free populations in scale - free potentials , in which the core radius of the dark matter @xmath122 is also zero .",
    "however , the virial ratios depend on the manner in which the limit @xmath123 and @xmath124 is approached , and so their results must be treated with caution .    more precisely , given a power - law density and potential with core - radii @xmath121 and @xmath122 respectively ,",
    "the virial ratios can be easily shown to depend just on the ratio @xmath125 .",
    "the limits @xmath126 and @xmath127 can be approached by keeping the ratio fixed . since different @xmath125 give different virial ratios , the final limit depends on the path by which the limit is approached , and so is not defined .",

    "we have provided the first systematic exploitation of the tensor virial theorem for tracer stellar populations , and shown how it can be used to yield constraints on global kinematics and flattening .",
    "this technique offers considerable advantages over , for example , the jeans equations .",

    "an obvious application is to population ii stars moving in the dark halo of our galaxy . for spheroidal tracer populations with flattening @xmath0 moving in spherical power - law potentials , there are analytic results that prescribe the ratio of globally averaged equatorial to vertical velocity dispersion . thanks to the flattening theorem , the results can be straightforwardly adapted to spheroidal dark halos with axis ratio @xmath1 in the equipotentials .",
    "the virial quantities depend only on the ratio @xmath2 in this instance",
    ".    the main astrophysical results of the paper are threefold .",
    "first , we have shown how to interpret the stellar kinematical measurements of halo stars in terms of the global flattening of the dark halo .",
    "in particular , if the smith et al .",
    "( 2009a ) values for the velocity dispersion of the halo subdwarfs are accepted , then the dataset is consistent with oblate dark halo models with a flattening in the potential of @xmath3 , corresponding to a flattening in the dark matter density contours of @xmath4 ; this is driven by the radial anisotropy that smith et al . found .",
    "if however , the kepley et al . ( 2007 ) values are preferred , then the dark halo may well be close to spherical .",
    "we have to make the assumption that the local kinematics are proxies for the global kinematics , which is assuredly a weakness in such analyses at present .",
    "however , the gaia satellite , which is scheduled to fly in 2013 , will for the first time provide us with detailed information on the three - dimensional kinematics of halo stars , and so there is hope for real advances using this technique in the near future .",
    "secondly , we have demonstrated that the dual halo structure as proposed by carollo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) appears to be incorrect .",
    "it is not possible to support an inner halo and an outer halo with the claimed velocity dispersions in the same gravitational potential : the model is inconsistent with the requirements of the virial theorem .",
    "a powerful aspect of virial methods is the fact that multiple populations residing in the same potential can be used to cross - constrain the dark hark halo mass and shape , without the need of building detailed models to reproduce the photometry and kinematics .",
    "there is considerable scope for extending our virial techniques to study multiple populations moving in the same gravity field , a topic that is already important in studies of the dwarf spheroidals  @xcite .",
    "thirdly , we have carried out an investigation into the kinematics of the thick disc .",
    "we find that the reported thick disc kinematics are consistent with a thin disc with scalelength and an isothermal dark halo .",
    "specifically , we find that the thick disc kinematics and shape is consistent with a potential generated by a thin disc with scalelength @xmath5 kpc , and surface - density normalisation of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "although nfw potentials can be used to fit the rotation curve , they seemingly fail to reproduce the virial ratios expected for the thick disc , as judged from the observational data .",
    "the near future sees a number of ambitious radial velocity surveys , such as eso - gaia and hermes .",
    "these will complement the abundant positional and proper motion data on stars in the galaxy that will be delivered by the gaia satellite . given the quality and quantity of the datasets",
    ", it is an attractive proposition to look at virial quantities to gain insight into the galaxy s potential , perhaps as a prelude to detailed phase space modelling .",
    "we anticipate that the tensor virial theorem will become an important tool to make sense of the very large datasets on stellar positions and velocities that will become available in the future .",
