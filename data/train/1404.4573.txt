    "the particulars of why and how cooperation evolves have perplexed evolutionary biologists and sociologists enduringly @xcite .",
    "a cooperator takes an altruistic action which supplies a benefit , @xmath0 , for another individual at a cost , @xmath1 , while a defector does nothing .",
    "one of the main tasks of evolutionary theory is to explain how and why cooperation is present .",
    "evolutionary game theory provides a powerful platform to understand the evolution of cooperation in unstructured populations , with the replicator equation in infinite populations @xcite and stochastic dynamics in finite populations @xcite .",
    "recently the assumption of a well mixed population is removed , and the population allows individuals to interact locally @xcite . typically networks are adopted to depict such population structure , since it is simple in definition , while complex in property @xcite .",
    "the nodes of the network represent individuals , while the edges denote connections in between @xcite . in this way",
    ", a network paves the way to capture the intrinsic idea of local interaction @xcite : individuals interact with their neighbors only .",
    "in particular , the degree of a node represents the number of neighbors of the focal individual , which indicates the interaction range .",
    "these network structures are widespread in human organizations @xcite , scientific collaboration among researchers @xcite , and even somatic evolution within multicellular organisms @xcite . however , for structured populations , in contrast with that in the well mixed case @xcite , it becomes challenging to analyze the evolutionary dynamics theoretically .",
    "this is because enormous possible topological configurations arise during the process of evolution @xcite . in spite of being challenging ,",
    "there are advances in the analytical methods @xcite .",
    "the main result is that local interactions can pave the way for the emergence of cooperation .",
    "the conflict between cooperation and defection is captured by the prisoner s dilemma in the beginning @xcite , a pairwise game .",
    "though the `` tragedy of commons '' , a multi - player game , was introduced to depict this dilemma long before @xcite , it has not been popular until recently owing to its complexity @xcite .",
    "this is also true in structured populations : for pairwise interactions , conditions for cooperators to be selected over defectors have been theoretically investigated in general structured populations @xcite . for multiple interactions , however , only two extreme types of network structure with cycle @xcite and well mixed populations @xcite have been addressed . for the network degree in between the minimum ( the cycle ) and the maximum ( well - mixed population ) , it is unclear under what conditions cooperation outperforms defection . besides , we introduce nonlinearity in the public goods , which is intrinsic to the fitness of multi - player games . for simplicity ,",
    "the synergistic and discountable effects of the public goods are adopted : these effects are wide spread in microbes @xcite .",
    "as a cluster of microbes secretes enzymes to digest the extracellular resource , the benefit of the secreted enzyme ( public goods ) provided by the first cooperative cell may play a vital role for survival , while the enzymes will eventually be saturated for the resource with the increase of cooperators , thus the cooperator cells joining the group later only contribute diminishing small benefits to the group @xcite .",
    "this is the discounting effect of the public goods . while for synergy",
    ", enzyme - mediated reactions will be launched by enzyme - producing cooperators . with the concentration of enzyme production , this may exhibit a faster efficiency than linear increase @xcite .",
    "in addition , the framework of synergy and discounting effects provides a unifying framework reconciling different social dilemmas @xcite , thus it does not lose generality in spite of its simplicity .",
    "the main result in the well mixed population is that synergy is beneficial for the emergence of cooperation while the discounting effect is detrimental .",
    "considering the importance of both the population structure and the multiple interactions on the evolution of cooperation , we theoretically explore how the combination of these two effects affects the emergence and stabilization of cooperation .",
    "to this end , we are addressing the stochastic dynamics of the public goods game with synergy and discounting in a generally random regular graph with arbitrary degree .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ main_2 ] provides a detail description of the model , and results are given in section [ main_3 ] .",
    "conclusion and discussion are drawn in section [ main_4 ] .",
    "finally , we present all the theoretical derivations in appendix [ appendix_a ] to [ appendix_d ] .",
    "we consider a finite population located on a graph of size @xmath2 .",
    "individuals are assigned to the nodes of the graph , whereas social ties between them are represented by the edges @xcite .",
    "every individual has @xmath3 neighbors . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] , players participate in the public goods game organized by themselves and their neighbors @xcite , that is to say , each player participates in @xmath4 public goods games of size @xmath5 .    for the public goods game , the first cooperator contributes a benefit @xmath0 while the @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) cooperator contributes @xmath8 to the common pool .",
    "every cooperator pays the same cost @xmath1 .",
    "defectors exploit the group by reaping benefits without paying anything .",
    "the accumulated benefits are distributed equally to all the @xmath9 players in the group irrespective of their behaviors .",
    "thus , defectors and cooperators receive the following payoffs @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of cooperators within the group . here",
    "@xmath12 is regarded as the discounting ( @xmath13 ) or synergy ( @xmath14 ) factor . as @xmath15",
    ", it degenerates to the linear public goods game with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the multiplication factor .",
    "( color online ) illustration of updating on a network .",
    "we show a network with size @xmath18 and every player has @xmath19 neighbors here .",
    "cooperator @xmath20 and defector @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) are neighbors of the selected cooperator @xmath23 with updating . both of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 )",
    "have neighbors with strategy of cooperation or defection except @xmath23 , which are called @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) , respectively . @xmath30 and @xmath31 also have neighbors @xmath32 , @xmath33 adopting strategy of cooperation and @xmath34 , @xmath35 with defection , where both of a and b mean 1 , 2 , or 3 .",
    "each player organizes a public goods game with all of its @xmath3 neighbors .",
    "thus each individual participates in @xmath4 public goods games of size @xmath4 @xcite . as an example , for the payoff of @xmath20 , all players marked within the dashed curve are relevant .",
    "the payoff comes from all games @xmath20 participates in , where one game ( shaded in blue ) held by @xmath20 , that is , part ( * a * ) , and the other three ( shaded in red ) held by @xmath36 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , that is , part ( * b * ) , ( * c * ) , and ( * d * ) .",
    ", width=226 ]    after playing the public goods game , the payoff @xmath37 of every player is transformed into fitness @xmath38 by fitness mapping @xcite .",
    "here we adopt the linear fitness which consists of baseline fitness and the payoffs arising from games @xcite , i.e. , @xmath39 where @xmath40 varying from @xmath41 to @xmath42 is the intensity of selection .",
    "for @xmath43 , the selection is weak .",
    "it means that the game is merely one of many factors which contribute to the entire fitness of an individual @xcite .    as to the updating rule , the `` death - birth '' ( db ) process @xcite is employed . within the process , a player in a population",
    "is randomly selected to die at each time step , and then all neighbors of the focused player , with probability proportional to their individual fitness , compete for the vacant site .",
    "we study the emergence of cooperation by comparing the fixation probability @xcite of a single cooperator ( @xmath44 ) invading a wild population of defective type under weak selection with that under neutrality @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath46 then natural selection favors cooperator replacing defector @xcite , so we see that natural selection favors the emergence of cooperation .",
    "we see that natural selection favors the stabilization of cooperation if @xmath47 , that is , natural selection opposes the fixation of defectors . and",
    "if @xmath48 , we see that natural selection favors cooperator over defector @xcite .",
    "we obtain the fixation probability of both cooperation and defection by the pair approximation ( see appendix [ appendix_a ] and [ appendix_b ] ) . for large population size and weak selection , we have a rule : @xmath49 if and only if @xmath50 and @xmath51 if and only if @xmath52 where the notations @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 can be found in appendix [ main_thesimplerule ] .        for the linear public goods game ( @xmath15 ) ,",
    "natural selection favors not only the emergence of cooperation but also its stabilization if and only if @xmath56 on this occasion , the rule is equivalent to @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the multiplication factor of the common pool .",
    "since @xmath59 , it implies theoretically that cooperative dilemma can be relaxed in structured populations compared with that in the well mixed case , without invoking any other additional mechanisms .",
    "we get @xmath48 if and only if @xmath60 for linear public goods game on the cycle ( @xmath61 in our model ) . and the same result is also found in @xcite , where , using a direct approach without approximations , van veelen _ et al . _",
    "pointed that @xmath48 if and only if @xmath62 . as group size @xmath63 , the linear public goods game on cycle coincides with that in the structured population with @xmath61 , and both deduce @xmath60 . what s more is that the general rule to determine the emergence of cooperation is found to be in good agreement with computer numerical simulations ( see the first row of fig .  [ fig_2 ] ) . and",
    "it also approximately applies to heterogeneous structured populations ( see the second row of fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ) .    based on the equation",
    ", we find that @xmath48 is also equivalent with the emergence @xmath46 and stabilization @xmath47 of cooperation .",
    "furthermore , the following equivalence holds @xmath64 for the public goods game which is either linear @xmath15 or on a cycle @xmath61 .",
    "that is to say , for large structured population under linear public goods game or public goods game with nonlinearity in individual payoff on cycle , we have that natural selection favors emergence of cooperation if and only if it favors stabilization of cooperation .",
    "further , we show that the critical value , both for the emergence and the stabilization of cooperation , is continuous with the discounting or synergy factor @xmath65 ( see appendix [ appendix_c1 ] ) .",
    "hence the equivalent proposition ( [ pcpd1n ] ) applies for infinitesimal nonlinearity ( see appendix [ appendix_c2 ] ) .        from the rule ( see inequalities and ) , we theoretically get the critical benefit - to - cost ratio @xmath66 for the emergence and stabilization of cooperation ( defection ) with the two factors combined , saying the spatial reciprocity and nonlinearity in payoff induced by multiple interactions . fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] shows that weak discounting significantly inhibits both the emergence and stabilization of cooperation , whereas the weak synergy favors them greatly .",
    "in contrast with the linear public goods game , the critical ratios @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 are no longer overlapping for nonlinear payoff effects ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ) . in other words , taking into account either discounting or synergy , a particular form of nonlinearity in payoff , the emergence and the stabilization of cooperation are no longer equivalent as in the linear public goods case ( see equivalent proposition ( [ pcpd1n ] ) ) .    for multiple interactions such as linear public goods , similar to pairwise interactions @xcite",
    ", cooperation will also be impeded with an increase of the number of neighbors ( see light gray up triangle in fig .  [ fig_3 ] ) .",
    "discounting in payoff significantly inhibits cooperation ( see fig .  [ fig_3]a ) .",
    "in particular , in this case , with the increase in the size of neighbourhood , it will become even harder for the emergence and stabilization of cooperation .",
    "the critical benefit - to - cost ratio is increasing much rapidly than its linear public goods game counterpart .    for weak synergy , the critical benefit - to - cost ratio @xmath66 for emergence or stabilization of cooperation still first increases as the growth of every player s number of neighbors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_3]b ) .",
    "but it decreases as neighbor size is big enough and tends towards zero .",
    "this illustrates that for small size of neighbor , increasing interaction range , i.e. @xmath3 , is detrimental for cooperation , which is consistent with linear public goods game ; yet the interesting story comes along when the interaction range is relatively large , in this case , increasing the interaction range is beneficial for cooperation , which is seldom observed in cooperative dilemmas .",
    "an intuitive understanding can be : for small neighbor size , the local competition plays a key role .",
    "even though the public goods are exponentially increasing with additional cooperator in a group , the group is small in size generally , thus the defector would reproduce more efficiently with the increase of size .",
    "this leads to the increase of the critical benefit - to - cost ratio . for large size of neighbors",
    ", however , the exponential increase in the accumulation of public goods with an additional cooperator outperforms the reproduction of defectors .",
    "for example , with the @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) cooperator s benefit @xmath8 to common pool , big @xmath71 induces large payoff @xmath72 to every player in the same group with weak synergistically enhanced effect @xmath65 as well as the baseline benefit @xmath0 .",
    "this rather large payoff paves the way for emergence and stabilization of cooperation for large neighbor size .",
    "therefore , it is the worst for emergence of cooperation when the number of neighbors is moderate .",
    "another intuitive explanation is that for weak synergy effect , the replicator dynamics allows the coexistence of cooperators and defectors @xcite , which is quite similar to the snowdrift game . for the snowdrift game ,",
    "however , local interaction can inhibit cooperation @xcite in contrast with the prisoner s dilemma @xcite .",
    "here , we explicitly show up to how many numbers would be the worst for cooperation in such scenario .",
    "it shows that synergistic interactions work with strangers in well mixed populations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we also find that the synergistic interactions do not work with neighbors in structured populations .    for stronger synergy",
    ", the critical benefit - to - cost ratio always decreases with the neighbor size ( see fig .  [ fig_4 ] ) .",
    "thus in this case cooperation could be promoted significantly with the increase of every player s number of neighbors under strong synergy , which intrinsically differs from effect of linearity , discounting , or weak synergy .",
    "this is because the synergy effect is so great that it effectively is a coexistence game where best relies should be of the population minority . in this case , enlarging the interaction range paves the way for cooperator mutants to be more like an minority yielding an enhancement of cooperation level .",
    "our results strongly suggest that the intrinsic multiple interactions , where payoffs are nonlinear in general , can cause the so called sea - sickness @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we find a rule theoretically elucidating the critical value of benefit - to - cost ratio @xmath66 up to which cooperation emerges and is stabilized . in addition numerical simulations verify the validity of the rule as well as its feasibility for random graph . for linear public goods game on any regular graph and any public goods game with synergy and discounting on a cycle , we find an equivalent proposition that the rule determines not only the emergence , but also the stabilization of cooperation .",
    "what s more , in public goods with synergy , we present that it can be the worst for the emergence of cooperation , as the number of neighbors is moderate .",
    "we find that synergistic interactions work with strangers but not with neighbors , and cooperation with both synergistic and local interactions can be worse than that with each alone .",
    "our work suggests that there can be a big shadow in the effects of combinational mechanisms on the evolution of cooperation .    over the past two decades ,",
    "structured populations depicted by networks have been taken into consideration to study the evolution of cooperation by virtue of evolutionary graph theory@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that cooperation can flourish in both static network and dynamic network @xcite ( for an exception , please see @xcite ) .",
    "the main reason is that these population structures can lead to a clustering of cooperative individuals @xcite , within which cooperators can survive by enjoying the benefits from mutual cooperation even though some cooperators are exploited by defectors along cluster boundaries .",
    "we indicate that in a non - additive public goods game , where nonlinearity in payoff arises , this clustering ( see equations ( [ appendix_nete1 ] ) and ( [ appendix_nete2 ] ) in appendix [ appendix_a2 ] ) is not always beneficial when the neighbors are few in number : in a synergy public goods scenario , where the latter cooperators in the group contribute significantly much more than the previous cooperators , the worst case for cooperation emerges when the number of neighbors is moderate , not too big nor too small .",
    "this means that synergistic interactions work with strangers but not with neighbors .",
    "our results show that the interaction between different mechanisms @xcite might trigger novel unexpected results .",
    "the combination of different factors with each promoting cooperation alone can be worse than every factor alone in promoting cooperation .",
    "thus , it may be promising to investigate the combination of previous mechanisms promoting cooperation .",
    "we find that the rules governing the emergence and stabilization of cooperation are equivalent for linear public goods games , which is validated by numerical simulations on homogenous as well as heterogenous structured populations .",
    "the rule simply asks the benefit to cost ratio @xmath66 to exceed a critical value @xmath73 , where @xmath3 is the average number of neighbors in the population .",
    "in fact , for any number of neighbors @xmath3 , the numerator of the critical value is @xmath74 , which suggests the number of individuals relevant to the payoff of the focal individual with recounting ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ) , i.e. , the product of the group size @xmath4 and the average number of the public goods game every player involved in , @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , in this case , as in a well mixed population , multiple interactions significantly inhibit the cooperation than its pairwise counterpart . for public goods games on a cycle , with either linearity , discounting , or synergy .",
    "the equivalence still holds between the rules facilitating the emergence of cooperation and that governing the stabilization .",
    "therefore the same criterion applies to determine under what condition the average abundance of cooperation exceeds that of defection in the mutation - selection equilibrium under small mutation @xcite .    the equivalence falls down for general population structures and nonlinear public goods game . for the synergy effect , the emergence and the stabilization of cooperation are facilitated significantly for any number of neighbors compared with the linear public goods game .",
    "being stabilized , in this case , is much easier than the emergence . for the discounting effect ,",
    "both the emergence and the stabilization of cooperation are inhibited significantly for any number of neighbors compared with the linear public goods game .",
    "being stabilized , in this case , is much harder than the emergence .",
    "therefore , both synergy and discounting has a more significant role in the stabilization compared with the emergence .    as applications , for microbes with either synergy and discounting public goods , in particular ,",
    "if the public goods are diffusive @xcite , the average degree of the network suggests the diffusion rate of the public goods .",
    "our result suggests that for the discounting public goods game , only a low diffusion rate of public goods can make the cooperator cells thrive ; for the synergy public goods game , however , it is always better than the discounting case .",
    "the interesting result lies in the fact that cooperation is better off for both very low and very high diffusion , whereas is worst off for moderate diffusion rate .",
    "experimental validation along this line might be interesting .",
