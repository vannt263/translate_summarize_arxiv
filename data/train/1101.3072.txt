    "the observation that the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formed in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) behaves almost like a perfect fluid  @xcite , inspired numerous theoretical efforts to quantify the transport properties of the produced strongly interacting medium . in particular , various attempts have been proposed to calculate bulk and shear viscosities for qcd matter by means of different techniques ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) . likewise endeavours have been made to reliably extract information on the viscosity coefficients from rhic measurements by continuously improving the phenomenological analysis of data ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) . while currently heavy - ion collision phenomenology seems to focus on the shear viscosity as a relevant quantity , a firm knowledge of the bulk viscosity as well as other transport coefficients",
    "is equally needed to characterize the properties of the qgp concisely .",
    "the bulk viscosity @xmath0 is a particular transport coefficient vanishing , within many models , in the non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic limits as well as for conformally invariant systems . in strongly interacting matter",
    ", the bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath1 is expected to be small outside the deconfinement and chiral phase transition region . in the vicinity of the transition region , however , it is expected to become large and even to diverge at a second order phase transition  @xcite . therefore , a precise knowledge of @xmath0 might be essential to understand and quantify the transport dynamics of the strongly interacting fluid in the critical region .    the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath2 for qcd matter , on the other hand , is expected to be large , i.e. @xmath3 , at large temperatures @xmath4 , whereas in the vicinity of the deconfinement transition temperature @xmath5 it exhibits a minimum .",
    "such a behaviour is known for a variety of liquids and gases  @xcite and was conjectured  @xcite to appear also in strongly interacting matter .",
    "the ratio @xmath2 was shown to exhibit a universal behaviour in gauge theory plasmas at infinite t hooft coupling and infinite number of colours  @xcite , which led to the conjecture of a fundamental lower bound @xmath6 ( kovtun - son - starinets bound in natural units ) for any physical system  @xcite .",
    "a similar universal behaviour for the bulk viscosity or other transport coefficients is in contrast not known  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , in specific strongly coupled and nearly conformal theories that allow for a holographically dual supergravity description  @xcite , the ratio of bulk to shear viscosity was found to behave as @xmath7 where the proportionality constant is of order @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the squared sound velocity expressed as derivative of the thermal pressure @xmath10 with respect to the energy density @xmath11 .",
    "recently , a lower bound on this ratio , @xmath12 ( buchel bound ) , was conjectured for strongly coupled gauge theories in @xmath13 spatial dimensions as being valid for all temperatures , where the holographically dual supergravity description is allowed  @xcite .",
    "this bound is exactly saturated as kinematical identity for all strongly coupled theories with holographic dual related to non - conformal branes  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in scalar field theory  @xcite as well as for photons interacting with massive particles of a thermal fluid  @xcite , it was shown that the ratio @xmath14 is uniquely determined by @xmath15 in qcd , bulk and shear viscosities were calculated for large temperatures and small running coupling within kinetic theory  @xcite . under the relaxation time approximation by assuming equal collision rates for bulk and shear viscosities  @xcite , these results give rise to a ratio @xmath14 that behaves parametrically like in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "thus , in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) the bulk to shear viscosity ratio depends quadratically on the conformality measure @xmath16 .",
    "this implies that the buchel bound is violated in high temperature qcd at small running coupling .",
    "even though the precise holographic dual to qcd is currently unknown , one could expect from eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and  ( [ eq2 ] ) that for deconfined strongly interacting matter the ratio @xmath14 undergoes a gradual change from the non - perturbative to the perturbative regime , rendering its dependence on the conformality measure from a linear to a quadratic one .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the temperature dependence of the viscosity ratio from @xmath5 towards large @xmath4 in order to understand how the transport properties of the medium are influenced by its thermal properties .    in this work ,",
    "considering the gluon plasma as composed of quasiparticle excitations with medium - modified dispersion relation , we analyze the properties of the bulk to shear viscosity ratio .",
    "the equilibrium thermodynamics of such a quasiparticle model ( qpm ) was shown to describe successfully lattice qcd results on the equation of state and related quantities for pure @xmath17 gauge theory  @xcite . to study the transport properties of the quasigluon plasma",
    ", we apply an effective kinetic theory approach  @xcite . from the results for bulk and shear",
    "viscosities obtained in this way , we show that in a quasiparticle picture the ratio @xmath14 exhibits indeed the above discussed behaviour with @xmath18 : at large temperatures , i.e.  in the perturbative regime , the dominant dependence of @xmath14 on the conformality measure is quadratic , whereas near the deconfinement transition it renders into a linear behaviour .",
    "the turning point between the two is located in the vicinity of the maximum in the scaled interaction measure .",
    "thus , on the level of transport properties , a phenomenological quasiparticle model of the gluon plasma provides a systematic interpolation between the regimes of weak and strong coupling .",
    "assuming that the kinetics of quasigluons is appropriately described by an effective kinetic equation of boltzmann - vlasov type , the phase - space behaviour of the single - particle distribution function @xmath19 follows from @xmath20 $ ] , where @xmath21 is the liouville operator , @xmath22 is the vlasov mean field term and @xmath23 is the collision term . in local thermal equilibrium , the functional @xmath24 , and the thermodynamics of the qpm should be recovered  @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the bose distribution function for gluon excitations with energy @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the temperature dependent ( but momentum independent ) gluon self - energy .",
    "the degeneracy factor for colour and polarization degrees of freedom is @xmath29 .",
    "self - consistency of this approach dictates the form of the vlasov term .",
    "in particular , this implies that in local thermal equilibrium @xmath22 must be related to the temperature dependence of the self - energy in order to maintain thermodynamic self - consistency  @xcite .",
    "the viscosity coefficients can be derived from the above effective kinetic theory by assuming small deviations from local thermal equilibrium .",

    "therefore , besides a proper description of equilibrium thermodynamics of pure @xmath17 lattice gauge theory , our quasiparticle model of the gluon plasma also describes its viscosity coefficients , cf .",
    "@xcite , and reproduces the dependencies of their ratio on @xmath18 as expected in the weak and strong coupling regimes , thus , providing a systematic link between the two . for momentum independent relaxation times , assumed to be common for bulk and shear viscosities , we find a significant dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath43 .",
    "this might imply consequences for viscous hydrodynamic simulations , cf .  the studies in  @xcite , in particular for lhc energies , where a larger temperature range is probed .",

    "<S> the viscosity ratio is uniquely determined by a quadratic dependence on the conformality measure , whereas in certain strongly coupled and nearly conformal theories this dependence is linear . employing an effective kinetic theory of quasiparticle excitations with medium - modified dispersion relation , we analyze the ratio of bulk to shear viscosity of the gluon plasma . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in this approach , depending on the temperature , the viscosity ratio exhibits either of these dependencies found by means of weak coupling perturbative or strong coupling holographic techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the turning point between the two different dependencies is located around the maximum in the scaled interaction measure .    </S>",
