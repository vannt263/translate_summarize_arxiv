    "the function @xmath7 as a distribution function is uniquely determined by the functional equation @xcite @xmath11 this implies @xmath12 .",
    "the number - theoretic significance of the function @xmath7 is apparent from the fact that it is exactly the limit probabilistic distribution of rationals in the @xmath13th generation of the calkin - wilf tree @xcite ( which is just a permutation of the stern - brocot tree ; the farey tree is a subtree of both ) .",
    "this tree is defined as follows .",
    "starting from the root @xmath14 , each fraction generates two offsprings @xmath15 elementary considerations show that this tree contains any positive rational number once and only once in lowest terms @xcite .",

    "this fact can be easily inherited directly from the definition .",
    "first , if rational number @xmath17 is represented as a continued fraction @xmath18 $ ] , then the map @xmath19 maps @xmath17 to @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "second , the map @xmath21 maps @xmath17 to @xmath22 $ ] in case @xmath23 , and to @xmath24 $ ] in case @xmath25 .",
    "this is an important fact which makes the investigations of rational numbers according to their position in the calkin - wilf tree highly motivated from the perspective of metric number theory and dynamics of continued fractions .",
    "we refer the reader to papers @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for a wider overview of the properties of @xmath0 , and to a web page @xcite for an exhaustive bibliography list .",
    "+ the work @xcite by the author initiated study of the moments of the minkowski question mark function .",
    "surprisingly , the only work where an analogous sequence of moments was considered before is @xcite , where the authors consider the moments of a related singular function @xmath26 .",
    "the moments of the question mark function are defined by @xmath27 this sequence is of definite number - theoretical significance because @xmath28^{l } , \\label{mom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( the summation takes place over rational numbers presented as continued fractions ; thus , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "as an example of structural properties of the sequence @xmath32 we mention the following result .",
    "let @xmath33 , which is an entire function .",
    "one of the main results about @xmath34 is that it is uniquely determined by the regularity condition @xmath35 as @xmath36 , the boundary condition @xmath37 , and the integral equation @xcite @xmath38 ( here @xmath39 stands for the bessel function @xmath40 ) .",
    "this reveals the surprising fact that @xmath34 can be considered as the dyadic analogue of entire functions associated with maass wave forms @xcite .",
    "also , the generating function @xmath41 can be analytically continued to the cut plane @xmath42 and it satisfies the three term functional equation @xmath43 minding the specific form of this equation , it is natural to call @xmath44 _ the dyadic period function . + it is not clear whether there exists a closed form formula for the moments @xmath32",
    "this would be greatly desirable minding the expression ( [ mom ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , one has the following asymptotic result @xcite .",
    "let @xmath45 .",
    "then the following estimate holds , as @xmath46 : @xmath47 both implied constants are absolute .",
    "the aim of this paper is to find the first exact asymptotic term .",
    "though from our point of view this is of inferior significance than the closed form formula ( if the latter does exist ) , nevertheless , it is of definite interest too . _",
    "let @xmath32 be defined by ( [ moments ] )",
    ". then the following holds as @xmath46 : @xmath48{4\\pi^{2}\\log2}\\cdot c_{0}\\cdot l^{1/4}{\\sf c}^{\\sqrt{l}}+ o(l^{-1/4}{\\sf c}^{\\sqrt{l}}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the constant @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is @xmath52periodic function given by @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "_ remark 1 .",
    "_ the periodicity of @xmath51 is obvious from ( [ distr ] ) .",
    "numerically , @xmath55{4\\pi^{2}\\log2}\\cdot c_{0}=2.356229889908+$ ] .",
    "the sequence of moments @xmath56 is equally important .",
    "these moments represent values of higher left derivatives of @xmath44 at @xmath57 ; more precisely , a formal taylor expansion at @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 as it was proved in @xcite , one has the asymptotic formula @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , in this case there exists an exact convergent asymptotic series @xcite .",
    "though sequences @xmath60 and @xmath32 are linearly dependent via relations @xmath61 it is nevertheless significant that the same structural constant @xmath49 does manifest in asymptotic formulae for both of these sequences . +",
    "as it is clear from the proof , other terms of asymptotic expansion can be calculated as well .",
    "we confine to the first term since calculations are standard ( though tedious ) with no new ideas being introduced .",
    "note that the structural constants @xmath62 do appear in the asymptotic expansion , and the method used shares some similarities with the euler - maclaurin summation .",
    "+ if we start from the representation of @xmath32 via the last integral of ( [ moments ] ) ( which is the most natural ) , then to obtain the representation by the first integral we use the second equation in ( [ distr ] ) .",
    "moreover , one of the core stages of the proof relies on the periodicity of @xmath51 and so uses the first equation in ( [ distr ] ) .",
    "since these two equations are characteristic only to the minkowski question mark function , generally speaking , our asymptotic formula for the moments of @xmath7 is unique among similar results for other probabilistic distributions with proper support on the interval @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "in this paper we use the notation of landau to denote by @xmath63 some absolutely bounded function in certain neighborhood of a variable ; in our case @xmath63 depends mostly on @xmath64 and we consider the case @xmath46 . as a convention , @xmath63 stands for different function if considered in another or even the same formula .",
    "occasionally , this notation is used to denote dependence on other variables and in each case it should be clear what variable and neighborhood is implied in a notation @xmath63 . the main tool of the proof is a laplace method .",
    "the latter is used in finding an asymptotic expansion of certain integrals depending on parameter .",
    "though in our case certain corrections , amendments and variations are necessary , the main technique is standard and can be found , for example , in @xcite . since @xmath65 ,",
    "identity ( [ moments ] ) implies @xmath66 put @xmath67 .",
    "the function @xmath68 achieves its maximum at @xmath69 , where @xmath70 let @xmath71 , and let us rewrite the expression for @xmath32 as @xmath72 our specific choice in extracting @xmath49 out of @xmath51 as a dominant ingredient can be motivated for the following reason . since @xmath73 ,",
    "the main weight of the integral defining @xmath32 ( as far as @xmath51 is concerned ) befalls on a certain constant in the range @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , it is easy to verify that for any continuous @xmath52periodic function @xmath75 one has @xmath76 this can be seen empirically from the fact that in the first case the dominant weight of the integral is supported only in the neighborhood of @xmath77 , while in the second case this interval has a length tending to infinity . as it is seen from the next subsection , we have the second case ( _ a posteriori _ , the weight of @xmath32 is properly supported on the interval @xmath78 , and hence the correct constant is @xmath49 rather then @xmath79 .          first , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "suppose @xmath89 .",
    "then the taylor formula gives that for certain @xmath90 $ ] one has @xmath91 direct calculations show that @xmath92 in the same fashion , @xmath93 where @xmath94 now let us evaluate the value of @xmath95 .",
    "for @xmath96 , we have @xmath97 further , @xmath98 we already obtained all necessary components to evaluate @xmath86 .",
    "note that @xmath99 since @xmath100 for @xmath101 , the function under the integral ( [ int ] ) in the range @xmath102 can be written as @xmath103 ( the bound @xmath104 was used in merging @xmath105 and @xmath106 into @xmath107 ) .",
    "thus , we have decomposed the function under integral ( [ int ] ) into the sum of twelve functions .",
    "it is important to note that two of these functions @xmath108 though being comparatively large , are odd function in @xmath109 and consequently contribute @xmath77 after integration .",
    "we are left with evaluating all the rest summands .",
    "this is a routine job .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xmath110 the second example : @xmath111 another example : @xmath112 therefore , a direct inspection shows that all functions apart from the main term contribute at most @xmath113 into the value of @xmath80 .",
    "we are left with determining the magnitude of the main term . since @xmath114 , this yields @xmath115 and so , the main term is given by @xmath116{l}c^{-3/4}\\big{(}1+\\frac{\\mathcal{b}}{\\sqrt{l}}\\big{)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , we obtain the main asymptotic term @xmath117{4\\pi^{2}\\log 2}\\cdot l^{-3/4}{\\sf c}^{\\sqrt{l}}+\\mathcal{b}l^{-5/4}{\\sf c}^{\\sqrt{l}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ [ evaluation - of - mathscri_1-mathscri_2-and - mathscri_4 ] ] evaluation of @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      to evaluate @xmath119 , we use a standard inequality @xmath122 thus , since @xmath123 is an increasing function in the interval @xmath124 $ ] , we have @xmath125 further , using the inequality ( [ nell ] ) , we have @xmath126 ( recall that @xmath127 ) . therefore , @xmath128 in the same vein , @xmath129 since @xmath123 is decreasing in the interval @xmath130 , we obtain @xmath131 combining all the estimates for @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath86 and @xmath120 , we eventually obtain @xmath132{4\\pi^{2}\\log 2}\\cdot l^{-3/4}{\\sf c}^{\\sqrt{l}}+\\mathcal{b}l^{-5/4}{\\sf c}^{\\sqrt{l}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      in this subsection we can be more concise , since the method is the same as we used to evaluate @xmath80 . recall that @xmath134 let @xmath135 the definition of @xmath49 yields that @xmath136 is bounded ( and periodic ) function . using an integration by parts , we can rewrite an expression for @xmath133 as @xmath137 where @xmath138 note that @xmath139 as a matter of fact , we have a completely analogous integral to the one defining @xmath80 , with the major difference in the estimate @xmath140 , whereas @xmath141 . thus , using the same method to evaluate @xmath133 as we did with @xmath80 , one gets @xmath142 since @xmath143 , this finishes the proof of theorem 1 .",
    "@xmath144      as can be inherited from the proof , the share of integrals @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 into the exact value of @xmath32 is of order @xmath145 .",
    "thus , a standard machinery of an asymptotic expansion shows that all terms for asymptotic series of @xmath32 are supported on the neighborhood @xmath102 .",
    "more thorough inspection reveals that @xmath146 as was mentioned , every term of this expansion can be obtained by ( increasingly tedious ) computations .",
    "for example , @xmath147 is a sum of @xmath49 and @xmath148 , each multiplied by some explicit constant ( constant @xmath149 occurs while extracting the main term of the integral @xmath133 ) .",
    "nevertheless , from a number - theoretic point of view our main concern is the structure of values @xmath32 rather than their magnitude ( though dominant ) in some small neighborhood of @xmath150 , and hence we have confined only in exhibiting such possibility of asymptotic expansion . + we finish with providing a table for some values of constants @xmath32 .",
