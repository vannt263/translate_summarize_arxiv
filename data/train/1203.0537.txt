    "current evidence from oscillations experiments @xcite allows to conclude that the involved neutrinos are very light massive particles and that their flavors are mixed .",
    "one of the most intriguing and still unsolved questions in particle physics is to elucidate if neutrinos are dirac or majorana fermions @xcite .",
    "the majorana nature of neutrinos can be established in the simplest way through the observation of processes where the total lepton - number @xmath8 is violated by two units ( @xmath5 ) , a property that emerges from the non - invariance of the neutrino mass term @xcite under global phase transformations of majorana fields .    up to now , most experimental efforts have focused on searches of neutrinoless double beta nuclear decays @xcite , which is by far the most sensitive @xmath7 channel .",
    "the non - observation of these decays @xcite has provided very strong constraints on the existence of very light majorana neutrinos , and has established direct upper bounds on the effective majorana mass of the electron - neutrino @xmath9 at the sub - ev level @xcite ( here we define @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 labels the neutrino mass eigenstates ; see section ii for notation ) .",
    "direct bounds on other entries of the effective majorana mass matrix are very poorly known @xcite , but indirect upper limits can be obtained by combining oscillation data @xcite , cosmological bounds @xcite and tritium beta decay @xcite . in turn , these indirect bounds on @xmath13 can be used to predict other @xmath7 decays , such as same - sign dileptons produced in @xmath14 lepton or @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 meson decays .",
    "the predicted rates in this light majorana neutrino scenario turn out to be extremely suppressed @xcite and beyond the sensitivities of current and future superflavor factories .",
    "a nice explanation for the very light scale of neutrinos can be found in the existence of additional heavy right - handed neutrinos via the see - saw mechanism @xcite . as a remnant of lepton - number violating majorana mass terms",
    ", the couplings of lepton charged currents can induce @xmath7 processes when expressed in the basis of majorana neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "however , the exchange of very light or very heavy majorana neutrinos in these decays are strongly suppressed and usually also lead to unobservable rates @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario is provided by the so - called _ resonant mechanism _",
    "@xcite which can produce large enhancements of the @xmath7 transition amplitudes if the masses of exchanged majorana neutrinos are accessible to the energy scales of the physical processes . in this case , the non - observation of lepton number violating decays can be turned out into significant constraints on the mixings and masses of majorana neutrinos .",
    "let us note that such heavy neutrinos in the range of a few kev to a few gev can play an important role in cosmology and astrophysical processes @xcite , without conflicting neutrino oscillation data .",
    "for instance , some extensions of the standard model incorporating right - handed singlet neutrinos provide a good candidate for dark matter in the form of a stable sterile neutrino in the range of a few kevs @xcite ; also , such models contain additional heavier sterile neutrinos with masses of @xmath18 which can explain the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite .",
    "alternatively , majorana neutrinos with masses in the range of a few hundred mev to a few hundred gev can be generated dynamically in extended technicolor model realizations of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .    at low energies ,",
    "the resonant enhancement scenario has been studied in several decays of pseudoscalar mesons and tau leptons .",
    "the three - body decays @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite ( charged conjugated modes are implied in all channels ) . in the case of",
    "the @xmath14 lepton decays some constraints can be derived on the product of two different mixing angles ( for instance @xmath23 ) as a function of the neutrino mass @xmath24 @xcite , while the decays of pseudoscalar charged mesons allow to constrain also the individual mixing angles , for instance @xmath25 , as a function of the neutrino mass @xcite .",
    "very recently , we have reported the first calculation of the four body decays @xmath26 @xcite , which are expected to provide complementary constraints to the three - body decays of their charged counterparts . at higher energies",
    ", the production of same - sign dileptons at colliders @xcite and in top quark decays @xcite has also been considered in the literature .",
    "searches for @xmath7 three - body decays have been carried out by several experiments and the upper limits on the branching fractions can be found in refs .",
    "new upper limits on branching fractions of lepton number violating decays of charged @xmath17 mesons have been reported recently : @xmath27 the belle collaboration @xcite has obtained @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) at the 95% confidence level ( cl ) ; @xmath30 the babar collaboration @xcite has reported upper limits at the 90% cl for @xmath31 ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) of the order of a few times @xmath34 ; @xmath35 the lhcb collaboration has obtained results on the @xmath36 decays ( @xmath37 ) with upper bounds ranging from @xmath38 to @xmath34 @xcite ; in addition , an upper limit has been reported for the four - body decay @xmath39 at the 95% cl @xcite . finally ,",
    "searches for @xmath40 decays of the @xmath14 lepton have been reported by the belle collaboration on six different @xmath19 decay channels , with upper limits on branching ratios of the order of @xmath34 @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the @xmath7 tau lepton decays @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 or @xmath2 , and @xmath3 or @xmath4 meson ) within the scenario provided by the resonant majorana mechanism .",
    "these decays allow to derive bounds on the @xmath25 ( @xmath41 ) mixings , contrary to the case of three - body @xmath14 lepton decays which only allow to derive bounds on the product @xmath42 .",
    "given the clean environment provided by @xmath14 lepton decays , these bounds on the majorana neutrino mixings are free from hadronic uncertainties that are intrinsic to decays of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "therefore , these novel decay channels allow to derive constraints on the mixings that are complementary to those obtained from tau lepton and meson decays .",

    "one important advantage of these four - body @xmath14 lepton decays is that they are free from the hadronic uncertainties associated to the decays of pseudoscalar charged mesons and depend only on well known decay constants of pseudocalar and vector mesons . by assuming experimental sensitivities of @xmath6 for branching ratios of different channels at superflavor factories , we find that the @xmath7 four - body decays of @xmath14 leptons can provide constraints for mixing angles @xmath116 to @xmath117 , which are similar or better that the ones obtained from @xmath17 and @xmath16 meson decays .",
