    "more than @xmath0 years ago anderson has discussed the behavior of a superconductor in the presence of strong disorder .",
    "@xcite according to his analysis ( and under the restriction to elastic scattering from non - magnetic impurities ) the bcs wave - function , build from bloch - type wave functions with opposite momenta , can be generalized to pairs made from the exact single - particle wave - functions of the disordered system plus their time - reversed partner . as a result one would expect a gradual dependence of the superconducting transition temperature on the presence of non - magnetic impurities caused mainly by a modification of single - electron properties as density of states etc . while this picture is certainly correct for weak disorder , experiments on thin films of strongly disordered superconductors @xcite have revealed a much more interesting behavior than suggested by ref .  .",
    "in particular , the observation of a superconductor - insulator transition ( sit ) with increasing disorder provides evidence for an interesting interplay between localization of cooper pairs and long - range superconducting ( sc ) order .",
    "@xcite moreover , the observation of a pseudogap in strongly disordered sc films @xcite bears some resemblance to similar experimental findings in high - temperature superconductors @xcite that may suggest a common mechanism in some regions of the phase diagram .",
    "theoretical investigations of disordered superconductors are either based on bosonic or fermionic approaches . in case of s - wave superconductivity",
    "the latter typically start from attractive hubbard models where disorder is usually implemented via a shift of onsite energy levels .  @xcite these hamiltonians then are either treated within a standard bogoljubov - de gennes approximation @xcite or with more sophisticated approaches like monte - carlo methods .",
    "@xcite bosonic models are then obtained from a large - u expansion , as e.g. the pseudospin @xmath1 model in a transverse field@xcite , where the hopping of cooper pairs ( corresponding to pseudospins aligned in the @xmath1 plane ) competes with localization due to random fields ( corresponding to pseudospins aligned in the perpendicular direction ) .",
    "further simplifications , as e.g. an ising model in a random transverse field , are also introduced since they allow for analytical treatments .",
    "@xcite    in recent years both approaches have lead to a coherent picture of the sit : with increasing disorder the system starts to break up into `` puddles '' with finite sc order parameter @xmath2 and intermediate regions with @xmath3 although the spectral gap remains finite .",
    "the order parameter distribution shows a universal scaling behavior , in agreement with experiment , where the relevant scaling variable is the logarithm of the order parameter distribution normalized to its variance .",
    "@xcite the phases of different puddles are weakly coupled , so that the system bears some resemblance with a granular superconductor . upon applying a vector potential",
    "the system accommodates the phase twist in the regions with @xmath3 so that the associated energy , and thus the superfluid stiffness , are strongly reduced .",
    "moreover , calculations within the bdg approach of the attractive hubbard model have shown that the induced current flows along a quasi one - dimensional percolative path or `` superconducting backbone '' which connects the puddles .",
    "@xcite this result has its counterpart in the analysis of the bosonic approach which has revealed a regime of broken - replica symmetry where the partition function is determined by a small number of paths .",
    "@xcite for both , fermionic and bosonic models , there exists a critical value for the disorder strength above which the system becomes insulating .",
    "the sit is characterized by a vanishing of the superfluid stiffness , however , the single - particle gap persists across the transition@xcite .",
    "a still open issue is the nature of the spatial correlations in such granular sc state arising near the sit . in the classical ginzburg - landau - abrikosov - gorkov theory @xcite",
    "there is a single scale @xmath4 , whose reduction by disorder is mainly governed by the mean - free path @xmath5 via @xmath6 . on the other hand , in the vicinity of the anderson localization transition the coherence length",
    "is also controlled by the localization length .",
    "@xcite concerning the disordered attractive hubbard model with a fragmented sc ground state as mentioned above , there is only limited knowledge about amplitude , density and current correlations .",
    "previous quantum monte - carlo studies @xcite yield only limited information on the spatial dependence of the correlations due to the small ( @xmath7 ) lattice sizes . on the other hand investigations of response functions on larger clusters within the bdg approach where so far restricted to mean - field studies . in the present paper",
    "we evaluate the density , amplitude and current correlations by including fluctuations on top of the bdg solution thus generalizing the approach of refs .   to the case with disorder .",
    "in particular we are interested in the question of how the physics is governed by different length scales in different channels and how the formation of sc islands for strong disorder reflects in the corresponding correlation lengths .",

    "the enhancement of @xmath85 at @xmath25 is a remainder of this cdw instability at half - filling which is transfered to the amplitude correlations via the mixed susceptibility @xmath68 shown in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "this rises the `` chicken and egg '' question if sites are favorable for superconductivity because they have a large susceptibility already in the normal state or if the large susceptibility is due to the local superconducting correlations . to answer this question",
    "we have computed the charge density susceptibility in the absence of superconductivity . although there is a tendency for sites with charge density susceptibility larger than the average in the normal state to become superconducting ,",

    "it also shows that on the sites with small order parameter the charge susceptibility remains the same in the superconducting and normal state .",

    "the behavior of the amplitude fluctuations is also very interesting .",
    "we find that local amplitude fluctuations are significantly enhanced when the sc gap displays strong variations as a function of disorder strength .",

    "<S> we investigate the disorder dependence of the static density , amplitude and current correlations within the attractive hubbard model supplemented with on - site disorder . it is found that strong disorder favors a decoupling of density and amplitude correlations due to the formation of superconducting islands . </S>",
    "<S> this emergent granularity also induces an enhancement of the density correlations on the sc islands whereas amplitude fluctuations are most pronounced in the insulating regions . while density and amplitude correlations are short - ranged at strong disorder we show that current correlations have a long - range tail due to the formation of percolative current paths in agreement with the constant behavior expected from the analysis of one - dimensional models . </S>"
