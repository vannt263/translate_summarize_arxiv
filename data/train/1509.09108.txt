    "the collective shift of the shiba states through a wide range of the gap ( and even the quantum phase transition ) suggests a correlated origin of the peaks within the triplet . in principle",
    ", three different scenarios may account for the occurrence of multiple shiba bound states in a type i superconductor : ( i ) different angular momentum scattering channels  @xcite , ( ii ) independent scattering at spins in different @xmath0 orbitals  @xcite , and ( iii ) bound state excitations coupled to other low - energy excitations , such as spin excitations or vibrations  @xcite .",
    "bound states , which originate from higher angular momentum scattering channels ( @xmath32 ) , always reside close to the gap edge , while the @xmath33 channel may shift through the superconducting energy gap depending on the coupling strength @xmath28  @xcite .",

    "as we will show in the following , a detailed analysis of the intensities of the shiba states allows us to unambiguously identify a magnetocrystalline origin of the splitting of the shiba states as predicted by itko and co - workers  @xcite for @xmath14 systems .",
    "the evaluation of the shiba intensities also sustains the assigned regimes of `` kondo screened '' and `` free spin '' ground states .",
    "such an analysis requires the spectral density of the molecule - substrate system , which can be directly related to the relative weight in the tunneling processes . for this",

    "their spectral weight should scale with the electron - phonon coupling strength , albeit being substantially lower than the weight of the main resonance  @xcite .",

    "our study shows the importance of anisotropy effects on the subgap excitations which determine the electron transport properties .",
    "they provide an unambiguous fingerprint of the nature of the ground and excited state throughout the whole range of magnetic interaction strengths , which drive the phase transition between the two quantum ground states .",
    "although the anisotropy energies are renormalized by the coupling to the substrates quasiparticles , this method can be used to extract knowledge about magnetic anisotropy and , hence , about spin - orbit coupling of magnetic adsorbates on superconductors .",
    "peculiar consequences of the split shiba states may occur for coupled magnetic impurities , which lead to the formation of extended shiba bands .",
    "if the exchange coupling strength is similar to or smaller than the anisotropy energy , the shiba bands are expected to reflect the splitting of the individual shiba states .",

    "<S> concomitantly with the formation of a shiba state , the exchange coupling between the magnetic adsorbate and the substrate also drives the formation of a singlet kondo state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the kondo energy scale @xmath1 is much larger than the superconducting pairing energy @xmath2 , the `` kondo screened '' state is the ground state . on the other hand , if @xmath3 , an unscreened `` free spin '' state with @xmath4 is the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> a shiba resonance as fingerprint of this magnetic interaction can be found in the quasiparticle excitation spectra within the superconducting energy gap if @xmath5  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this resonance corresponds to a transient state , in which an electron is added / removed to / from the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the electron occupation changes and the spin is altered by @xmath6 . in </S>",

    "<S> the weaker the exchange coupling and kondo screening , the closer is the shiba state to the fermi level . </S>",

    "<S> if the adsorbate carries a higher spin , multiple shiba states may appear inside the gap as discussed theoretically by itko and co - workers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they argue that such systems may involve multiple kondo screening channels with different coupling strengths @xmath13 and , hence , multiple shiba states . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a mutual coupling of the spins may lead to a splitting of the peaks in the excitation spectra in the presence of magnetic anisotropy . here </S>",
    "<S> , we resolve triplets of shiba states on single paramagnetic molecules . </S>",
    "<S> a multitude of different adsorption sites provides access to a large range of magnetic coupling strengths with the substrate . </S>",
