    "the standard homogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis predicts that the material emerged from this epoch was mainly made by @xmath8h and @xmath9he .",
    "the total mass fraction of heavier elements was lower than @xmath10 , so that the first generation of stars , the so called population iii , was built from matter essentially deprived of metals .",
    "such a peculiarity significantly affected the star formation phase .",
    "yoshii and saio @xcite found that the peak of the resulting imf for pop iii stars ranges between 4 and 8 @xmath11 .",
    "recently , nakamura and umemura @xcite have obtained that the typical mass of pop iii stars should be @xmath12 m@xmath13 .",
    "nevertheless , recent simulations of collapse and fragmentation of primordial clouds ( see e.g. @xcite ) obtain a jean mass @xmath14 m@xmath13 , although it is still not clear whether these clumps will further fragment down to stellar mass values .",
    "the key role in this process is played by molecular hydrogen rather than dust or heavy molecules cooling .",
    "therefore , early star formation with a normal present - day imf seems very unlikely . in this framework ,",
    "intermediate and/or very massive stars were the dominant constituents of the first stellar population .",
    "the simplest explanation for the absence of `` zero metal '' stars is that they have not survived up to the present epoch , which is compatible with the idea that primordial stars were not of low mass .",
    "thus , the very metal poor stars presently observed were formed from matter already enriched by the ashes of _ massive _ z=0 stars .",
    "consequently , an indirect way to search for pop iii stars is to look for their nucleosynthetic imprint in the extremely metal poor objects now observed .",
    "as it is well known , the most important contribution of intermediate mass stars to the chemical enrichment of galaxies comes from the nucleosynthesis occurring during the agb phase .",
    "the evolutionary models of 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 m@xmath13 ( z=0 , y=0.23 ) stars have been computed by the latest version of the franec code @xcite .",
    "no mass loss has been assumed .",
    "owing to the lack of metals the main differences in the evolution with respect to that of metallic agb stars are : 1 ) h burning starts at high temperature through the pp chains .",
    "the convective cores are smaller but h - burning extends to the 80@xmath15 of the stellar mass .",
    "the core contracts until the @xmath16 reaction starts ; then the burning switches to the cno , 2 ) during he - burning the star is at the blue side of the h - r diagram , therefore the 1@xmath17 dredge - up does not occur , and 3 ) during the agb phase the inward penetration of the envelope dredges - up he , c , n and o. for m@xmath18 m@xmath13 the amount of cno elements is enough to develop a normal tp phase . for m@xmath19 m@xmath13 the normal tp phase starts after an episode of c ingestion during the first pulses .",

    "as a consequence of the occurrence of normal tp , @xmath20 dredge - up and hot bottom burning , the pop iii nucleosynthesis scenario is revised . the duration of the whole agb phase has been determined by using the classical reimers formula for the mass - loss rate for different values of the scaling factor @xmath21 .",
    "the major products of these stars are @xmath22he , @xmath23li , @xmath3c and @xmath4n . in table 1",
    "we report the most important ( imf weighted ) yields provided by our z=0 ims models , namely : the abundance in mass fraction of a given element in the material ejected into the interstellar medium at the end of the agb phase .",
    "we have used the population iii imf proposed by yoshii and saio @xcite ( cases a & b ) and for comparison we also compute the yields from the salpeter imf .",
    "the [ c , n / fe ] ratios are obtained from z=0 agb and sn ii yields assuming an ejection of 0.05 m@xmath13 of fe per snii ( table 2 ) .",
    "the main results are :    * li is produced by the cameron - fowler mechanism particularly efficient during the first part of the agb phase .",
    "the maximum li yield obtained is of the order of the standard big - bang nucleosynthesis predictions .",
    "* c and n ( primary ) are built up during the agb phase .",
    "however , the c and n yields significantly change along the agb , thus the cumulative amount of these elements finally ejected depend on the mass loss history . *",
