    "we have developed a new , semi - analytic ( sa ) model for the dynamical evolution of cluster or galaxy halos .",
    "this model predicts halo substructure identical to that seen in high - resolution numerical simulations . we have used the sa model to study the origin of the local group satellites , the stellar halo , and the thick and thin disk components of the milky way .",
    "by accounting for the effects of reionization and evolving mass - to - light ratios , it is possible to produce luminosity functions similar to that of the local group ( figure 1 , left panel ) , provided reionization occurs at early epochs ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the disk of the central galaxy can be disrupted by direct collisions with large satellites .",
    "the model thus provides an upper limit to the age of stars still in disk orbits for each system .",
    "the mean ages of the model disks are 810 gyr , similar to the age of the milky way s disk .",
    "the disk can also be heated by small collisions or indirect encounters , without being completely disrupted . in many model systems ,",
    "minor encounters at early times produce a heated component similar to the thick disk of the milky way ( figure 1 , right panel ) ."
