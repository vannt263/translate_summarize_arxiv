    "galactic free - free emission is a principal foreground contaminant of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "it becomes a major component near the galactic plane where it is produced in the gas layer ionized by radiation from recently formed stars .",
    "a true all - sky free - free foreground template needs to include this low galactic latitude component if the cmb power spectrum is to be correctly evaluated at low values of angular frequency , @xmath14 , where there is currently significant interest .",
    "the diffuse electron gas along the galactic plane is also of intrinsic interest .",
    "it is an indicator of current star formation throughout the galaxy and complements the data available from catalogues of hii  regions which represent localized areas of star formation .",
    "there is considerable interest in the relationship between this narrow wim distribution with a scale height of @xmath15 150 pc and the thick disc component with @xmath15 1000 pc responsible for pulsar dispersion measures @xcite",
    ". issues of concern are the clumpiness ( filling factor ) , the scale height , and the electron temperature as well as the transport of ionizing radiation from the hot stars in the narrow distribution to the broad distribution .",
    "one of the direct ways of obtaining a free - free emission template is to use large - area h@xmath13  surveys .",
    "these include the wham survey @xcite which uses fabry - perot spectroscopy on an angular scale of @xmath16 covering the northern sky ( dec  @xmath17 ) .",
    "the wham instrument is now installed at the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) for the southern counterpart of the survey . the shassa survey @xcite employs a filter system with an angular resolution of @xmath18  arcmin and covers the southern sky ; it is however limited in sensitivity due to geocoronal emission and is insensitive to large angular scales ( @xmath19 ) due to the field - of - view .",
    "the vtss survey @xcite uses a similar filter approach on the northern sky on a 2 arcmin scale .",
    "before the data from these surveys can be used to derive a free - free template , the absorption by interstellar dust must be taken into account ; this correction is significant at intermediate and low latitudes . @xcite",
    "have used the @xcite dust map derived from the iras and dirbe @xmath20 m all - sky surveys . at @xmath21",
    "this correction breaks down and accordingly the h@xmath13  surveys can not be used for this purpose along the galactic plane .",
    "the construction of a free - free template at latitudes where absorption becomes significant can be attempted at ghz radio frequencies by exploiting the difference of temperature spectral index between free - free ( @xmath22 ) and synchrotron ( @xmath23 ) where @xmath24 .",
    "if 3 frequencies are available the free - free temperature can be derived along with the synchrotron temperature and spectral index ; this situation is somewhat complicated by the variation of spectral index with position and frequency .",
    "radio recombination lines ( rrls ) in contrast to h@xmath13  and free - free emission can be used to obtain the emission measure ( @xmath25 ) directly with no absorption or contamination .",
    "the lines themselves and the ionized medium in which they are immersed are optically thin at the frequencies used for this work .",
    "however , in order to convert the rrl line integral to a free - free emission brightness temperature a knowledge of the electron temperature @xmath26 is required ; there are a number of routes to obtaining @xmath26 .",
    "this paper describes an exploration of the rrl approach to obtaining a free - free template of a section of the galactic plane at @xmath27 , @xmath28 in data from the hi zone of avoidance survey using the parkes 13-beam h - line receiver system .",
    "section  [ sec : rrl ] summarizes rrl theory and examines previous rrl surveys which were of high sensitivity but limited area . in section  [ sec : rrl_survey ] we give the survey parameters and the criteria for selecting the longitude range for study .",
    "the data reduction and the rrl map derived in this study are described in section  [ sec : data_analysis ] .",
    "sections [ sec : free - free_from_rrl ] and [ sec : latitude_distribution ] convert the rrl line integrals into @xmath10 and compare them with the 21 cm continuum derived from this survey , as well as with h@xmath13  and wmap data .",
    "the rrl emission from a diffuse ionized hydrogen gas can be expressed in terms of the integral over spectral line temperature as @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the frequency ( khz ) , @xmath26 is the electron temperature ( k ) and the emission measure em is in @xmath31pc .",
    "the corresponding continuum emission brightness temperature is @xmath32    where @xmath33 is a slowly varying function of temperature and @xmath30 is the frequency in ghz @xcite .",
    "the ( 1 + 0.08 ) term represents the additional contribution to @xmath34 from helium .",
    "these equations lead to an expression for the ratio of the line integral to the continuum @xmath35    where @xmath36 is in  @xcite .",
    "most rrl surveys have concentrated on individual hii  regions for which an adequate continuum antenna temperature is achievable .",
    "the hii  region catalogue of lists @xmath37 sources with rrl data @xcite .    at frequencies near 1",
    "ghz the recombination lines are relatively weak ; for a typical line width of 25  and @xmath38  k , @xmath39 per cent and increases as @xmath40 .",
    "the thermal ridge of the galactic plane has a brightness temperature of @xmath41  k at 1  ghz ( see section  [ sec : latitude_distribution ] ) in the area we have chosen to study and accordingly the peak diffuse rrl emission temperature will be @xmath42  mk and correspondingly less if the emission is spread over a larger velocity range due to galactic differential rotation for example . if we are to determine the latitude width of the free - free emission , a sensitivity approaching a few mk is required .",
    "this implies integration times of @xmath43 hour with modern receiver systems at @xmath44 ghz .",
    "previous surveys of the diffuse galactic free - free emission have of necessity been restricted to observations of grids of points along the galactic plane , mainly on the galactic ridge ( @xmath45 ) .",

    "the beamwidth used and survey coordinates are given .",
    "an examination of these surveys shows line brightness temperatures of  50 - 100 mk in areas away from strong hii  regions .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the strongest emission seen in the @xmath14-range @xmath47 to @xmath48 compared to @xmath49 to @xmath4 is intrinsically due to the presence of the scutum arm . nonetheless , the emission in @xmath50 appears to be low , with the peak of the latitude distribution less than half of that in the range @xmath51 .",
    "there is also less extended emission around the plane , so the latitude distribution appears narrow and is mainly accounted for by the few hii  regions in that longitude range .",
    "this suggests that we might be losing some extended diffuse emission in the process , probably due to the bandpass removal associated with the scanning strategy . as described in section [ sec : data_red ] , the adopted bandpass removal technique , minmed5 , is appropriate for recovering extended emission , but only when it does not fill the entire scan .",
    "this is likely to be the cause of some flux density loss seen on the galactic plane in the zoa and the presence of negative sidelobes .",
    "we discuss this further in section [ sec : wmapmem ] . also , taking the minimum of a series of medians as the bandpass correction for an entire scan can introduce small variations between adjacent scans ( striping ) .",
    "in the previous sections we have derived the distribution of rrl line integral on and near the galactic plane at @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "this gives an unambiguous measure of @xmath10 when scaled for electron temperature .",
    "since this rrl emission is weak we will average it in longitude to provide a more sensitive determination of the latitude distribution up to @xmath52 . in this section other data",
    "are used to compare and extend our analysis of the free - free emission , namely h@xmath13 , wmap maximum entropy model and the 21 cm continuum .",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite to derive the h@xmath13  latitude distribution .",
    "wham , the sensitive h@xmath13  survey of the northern sky provides a map with accurately determined baselines at a resolution of @xmath53 60  arcmin @xcite .",
    "this map is then corrected for absorption by galactic dust using the @xcite @xmath20 m map corrected to a fixed dust temperature of 18.2  k. the total absorption ( for an extragalactic object ) at the wavelength of h@xmath13  is estimated as @xmath54 magnitudes where @xmath55 is the @xmath20 m temperature - corrected intensity in mjy  sr@xmath56 .",

    "a uniform mixing of gas and dust corresponds to an @xmath58 value of 0.5 .",

    "however , at lower latitudes the values determined from the h@xmath13  data are far higher than the observed free - free emission from rrls ( and wmap mem free - free ) . this would appear to indicate that the fds dust model for @xmath55 overestimates the absorption produced by the warm ( 40 k ) dust on the galactic ridge .",

    "where the wmap s s / n is low , templates made from external data are used as priors .",
    "these templates are : the haslam 408 mhz map for the synchrotron , the extinction - corrected h@xmath13  map @xcite for the free - free and the model 8 of @xcite map for the thermal dust .",

    "the brighter longitude range @xmath47 to @xmath48 is chosen because of the lower signal loss in this range ( see section [ sec : signalloss ] ) .",
    "we can see that the peak , at @xmath45 , of the mem distribution is about 30 per cent higher than that of the zoa .",
    "it is essential to point out that the @xmath10 estimation from the rrls depends on @xmath81 and that the electron temperature may vary across the @xmath82 region . as mentioned in section [ sec : em ] , it is likely to be higher for the diffuse emission than for individual hii  regions .",
    "if we increase the electron temperature to 8000 k , the zoa distribution will then increase by a factor of 1.16 , which makes the integral of the two distributions agree within @xmath83 .",
    "another difference between the two distributions is the fact that the zoa is not as symmetric around the plane as the mem is .",
    "this is due , as seen before , to the feature at @xmath84 that extendeds from the plane up to @xmath85 . as a result ,",
    "the fwhm of the zoa latitude distribution for this longitude range is @xmath86 , whereas the mem has a fwhm of @xmath87 . with the lack of information about free - free emission on the plane , it is not surprising if the maximum entropy method can not separate synchrotron and free - free accurately",
