    "we notice however that observers near ( but not exactly at ) the edge of the horizon have out - degrees approximately equal to @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the out - degree distribution is asymptotically a power law with a lower cut - off that grows as @xmath47 with time .",
    "we note that new connections appear not only between new and existing nodes , but also between pairs of already existing nodes , not previously connected .",
    "this type of linking creates directed cycles in the network .",
    "the appearance of new links between existing nodes is a simple consequence of the continuous expansion of the horizons of all observers .",

    "almost exactly the same results hold for any open flrw universe with any scale factor @xmath15 . the same picture as in fig .",

    "these graphs have poisson distributions of node degrees  @xcite .",
    "we can show that the in - degree distribution in our imperfect networks with @xmath90 is also poisson .",
    "this is intuitively expected because in this case observers are connected only to other observers in their small neighborhoods .",
    "the case with @xmath91 is more interesting . in this case , the average in - degree of an observer located at @xmath49 is @xmath92 . as a consequence , for the same combination - of - exponentials reasons as before , the in - degree distribution scales asymptotically as a power law @xmath93 with exponent @xmath94 which can take any value between @xmath73 and @xmath95 , as shown in fig .",

    "this result may have interesting cosmological implications concerning what part of the universe our observers can observe .",
    "indeed , in the case of imperfect communication with @xmath99 , observer @xmath0 directly detects only @xmath100 other observers .",
