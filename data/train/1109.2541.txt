    "a general question that naturally arises in the study of social systems is how collective behaviors can emerge from the interactions among individuals . in spite of the inherent complexity of these phenomena",
    ", simplified mathematical models that assume simple automatic responses of individuals to stimuli can reproduce non - trivial effects in the observed behavior  @xcite .",
    "statistical mechanics had a certain success in the use of coarse - grained models of physical systems to connect the microscopic dynamics with the macroscopic behavior , and its techniques and concepts are starting to be fruitfully applied to understand social dynamics  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the phenomena observed in the crowd dynamics , from pedestrians flows  @xcite to vehicular traffic  @xcite , have been recently subject to quantitative measures .",
    "observations range from bottleneck oscillations , lanes and stripes formation , intermittent flows , waves , turbulence  @xcite , faster - is - slower  @xcite and freezing - by - heating effects  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this extremely broad class of collective phenomena is explained at semi - quantitative level with the use of models of interacting particles or granular fluids .",
    "this shows that even if interactions among individuals in these settings are rather simplified and mechanical , they still lead to a certain level of collective coordination . in this paper",
    "we show how a crowd dynamics in a resources allocation context can give rise to a phase transitions between an active and an absorbing phase .",
    "the class of models we discuss is inspired by the kolkata paise restaurant ( kpr ) problem  @xcite , which we generalize and recast in the broader context of zero - range interacting particle models @xcite .",
    "the kpr is a repeated game played by a large number ( @xmath0 , @xmath2 being a real number ) of agents with equally shared past information .",
    "every evening they try to get the best service in one of the @xmath1 restaurants of commonly agreed ranks , each providing food for one person only .",
    "it serves as a paradigm for a problem of resource utilization , where agents learn from their actions to maximize the effective utilization of available resources . at unit density ( @xmath4 ) , a simple random choice algorithm  @xcite leads ( in unit convergence time ) to a occupation of a fraction of @xmath5 only of the resources , which of course falls much short of a fully efficient usage of them .",
    "as seen in various earlier studies  @xcite , apparently smarter strategies fail to yield better results . however , a stochastic strategy  @xcite that maintains a nave tendency to stick to an agent s past choice , with probability decreasing with the crowd size , leads to an efficient utilization fraction @xmath6 of about @xmath7  @xcite and it converges to the above within a time ( iteration ) independent of @xmath1 .",
    "an extension of this strategy to the minority game  @xcite problem ( with knowledge of both the sign and size of the population difference among two alternative choices ) , gives the optimal solution ( with fluctuation bounded by @xmath8 and convergence time bounded by @xmath9  @xcite ) .",
    "our focus will be on the nature of the collective behavior rather than on the efficiency of individual behavior .",
    "for the latter , we refer to applications of game theory and adaptive learning , as e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "we note , in passing , that the relation between the degree of individual rationality and the efficiency of collective allocation can be a non - trivial one , as shown e.g. in refs .  @xcite .    here",
    "we will study the general problem with @xmath1 restaurants and @xmath10 agents , where @xmath2 , the density , is a fixed external parameter of the dynamics .",
    "recasting the problem in terms of zero - range interacting particles , we report a phase transition from a frozen phase with satisfied agents to an active phase with unsatisfied ones at a critical density @xmath11 and perform extensive numerical simulations as well as some analytical calculations to understand its features , finding a good agreement with the exponents of stochastic fixed - energy sandpiles @xcite .",
    "the study of the relaxation properties of the frozen phase reveals an interesting faster - is - slower effect : this consists in the general observation that , from vehicular traffic to logistic , a higher level of coordination can arise from strategies which involve a slower dynamics ( e.g. waiting ) , that however speed up performances .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce the class of models under study .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : simul ] we present the results of numerical simulations and in sec .  [ sec : ana ] we provide the analytic treatment for the mean field case .",
    "we conclude with a summary and some discussions in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "inspired by the kpr problem  @xcite with @xmath1 individuals competing for @xmath1 restaurants ( each serving food to one person each ) , we propose a more generic and fundamental stochastic occupation problem with exclusion .",
    "the rank ordering among the restaurants , as in the original kpr problem  @xcite is dropped here and we consider in general @xmath10 agents , where @xmath2 , the density , is an external fixed parameter of the dynamics .",
    "we will refer from now on to individuals as particles and restaurants as the sites or nodes of an underlying graph . in these terms",
    "the original problem is defined in a fully connected geometry .    a particle moves from the site @xmath12 it occupies to a randomly chosen neighbor @xmath13 with a rate that depends only on the number of particles that is present on it @xmath14 .",
    "this is by definition a _ zero range process _ ( see @xcite for a review ) which allows us to conclude that the stationary probability distribution of the number of particles per site factorizes in terms of single site functions . given the nature of the problem , we will consider models with @xmath15 , i.e. costumers are happy while alone , and @xmath16 , i.e. repelling particles .",
    "given this expression for the rates , at low densities ( @xmath3 ) there are dynamically frozen configurations with sites filled by single particles . on the other hand , for high densities ( @xmath17 ) a finite fraction of sites  that we shall call ` active '  will have multiple occupancy .",
    "we will show that there is a transition between these two phases that occurs at a certain density @xmath18 .",
    "notice that , in principle , the process is ergodic so every configuration of is accessible .",
    "therefore , for @xmath19 , the process will sooner or later visit an absorbing configuration where @xmath20 for all sites @xmath12 .",
    "still , when @xmath1 is large enough and @xmath21 , frozen configurations will be visited extremely rarely , over time - scales which are much longer than those which are accessible to numerical simulations .",
    "we choose as the order parameter the steady state density of active sites @xmath22 ( density of sites having @xmath23 ) .",
    "so the absorbing phase corresponds to @xmath24 whereas , above some density @xmath11 the steady state shows a persistent dynamics with a non - zero value of the order parameter ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we will analyze in particular two models :    * @xmath26 * @xmath27 .",
    "we will refer from now on to a parallel dynamics in which a simultaneous update of the nodes is done at each time step , i.e. agents actions are simultaneous akin to a repeated game setting .",
    "it will be pointed out later that a sequential update in which at each step a randomly chosen particle jumps with some probability leads here to the trivial result that @xmath28 .",
    "this corresponds to the limit @xmath29 of model b.    the model a implements the stochastic crowd avoiding strategy of the original kpr problem@xcite . here ,",
    "if the site @xmath30 has @xmath31 particles , each of them stay back with probability @xmath32 in the next time step , otherwise it jumps to any of the neighboring sites .    in the model",
    "b an external parameter @xmath33 is introduced that represents the `` patience '' of costumers to overcrowded conditions . here",
    ", if the site @xmath30 has @xmath31 particles , each of them stays with probability @xmath33 in the next time step , otherwise it jumps to any of the neighboring sites .",
    "the model b is in practice a kind of fixed energy sandpile @xcite , but the study of its dynamics as a function of the parameter @xmath33 will reveal an interesting faster - is slower effect related to the relaxation time of the frozen phase .",
    "we finally point out that a waiting choice can be _ rational _ from the point of view of game theory : the agents in overcrowded sites could wait simply because they expect that others are leaving them alone .    in the next section",
    "we report a detailed analysis of the phase transition of both models with the use of numerical simulations in a fully connected geometry , a 1d chain and a 2d square lattice .",
    "then , we perform analytical calculations for the mean field case .",
    "we measure the times required to reach the steady state below and above @xmath11 . below @xmath11 ,",
    "the order parameter @xmath22 reaches a value @xmath34 in the steady state . above @xmath11",
    ", order parameter @xmath22 evolves to a stationary state and fluctuates around a mean value @xmath35 @xmath36 .",
    "the system has persistent dynamics in this phase .",
    "the evolution of the order parameter is exponential away from @xmath11 , and can be expressed as @xmath37\\ ] ] for @xmath21 , and @xmath38 for @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the relaxation time .",
    "we will denote the asymptotic value of the order parameter as @xmath22 hereafter .",
