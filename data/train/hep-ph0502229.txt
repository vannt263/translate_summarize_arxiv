    "predictions for the total , elastic and diffractive cross sections at the lhc energy @xmath1 , one order of magnitude bigger than currently available energy , are of great importance .",
    "because of that , a number of authors have been trying to provide such predictions .",
    "the most popular model used for this purpose is the regge theory with the soft pomeron @xcite , which describes very well the existing data but has one serious drawback ",
    "it violates the unitarity - based froissart  martin bound @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , because it seems that data from the present experiments are relatively far from this bound , the soft pomeron model is widely accepted .",
    "however , attempts also exist in which cross sections are determined in unitarity preserving descriptions .",
    "they are based either on the regge theory @xcite or qcd  inspired parameterizations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a method of determining the total , elastic and diffractive cross sections at the lhc in the framework of the miettinen - pumplin model which preserves unitarity @xcite .",
    "the validity of this model at the tevatron energy @xmath2 has been recently demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the miettinen and pumplin model is based on the good - walker picture of soft diffraction @xcite .",
    "the state of the incident hadron is expanded into a superposition of states which are eigenstates of diffraction @xmath3 @xmath4 where from unitarity : @xmath5 . if different eigenstates are absorbed by the target with different intensity , the outgoing state is no longer @xmath6 and the inelastic production of particles takes place .",
    "the inelastic diffractive cross section is proportional to the dispersion of the distribution of @xmath7 for the state @xmath6 .",
    "the basic assumption of miettinen and pumplin is that the eigenstates of diffraction are parton states @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of partons , and @xmath10 are rapidity and impact parameter ( relative to the center of the projectile ) of parton @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ expansion ] ) takes the form @xmath12 with a number of assumptions concerning parton distributions and interactions ( see @xcite ) , miettinen and pumplin arrived at the following formulae for the differential cross sections which depend on two parameters only : @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 the total cross sections @xmath18 and @xmath19 are obtained after the integration over the impact parameter @xmath20 .",
    "let us notice that single diffraction is only considered in the miettinen  pumplin model .",
    "the two free parameters @xmath21 and @xmath14 in the presented model can be calculated for a given energy @xmath22 , using the experimental values for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the results of such a calculation are presented in table  [ beta - gg ] .",
    "the errors of @xmath21 and @xmath14 are obtained with the help of the total differential method from the experimental errors of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "having determined the free parameters , the diffractive cross section can be _ predicted _ from eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) .",
    "as shown in table  2 , the predictions for @xmath19 are in good agreement with data at the energies of the order of tev @xcite .",
    "the predictions for @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath19 at the lhc in the the two scenarios are presented in table  [ cs - results ] .",
    "the errors are computed from uncertainties in the determinations of parameters of the straight lines in figures  [ beta - plot ] and [ gg - plot ] , using full covariance matrix .",
    "the dependence of the total and diffractive cross sections on the center - of - mass energy @xmath22 in our model ( as well as the predicted data points from table  2 ) is shown in figures [ tot - plot ] and [ diff - plot ] .",
    "a few comments are in order .",
    "our prediction for the total cross section at the lhc is @xmath27 smaller than the prediction of donnachie and landshoff with the soft pomeron : @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this difference can be attributed to unitarity constraints present in our approach , and reflected in the behaviour ( [ froissart ] ) .",
    "the result for @xmath23 is also smaller than those given in @xcite which are above the donnachie - landshoff value .",
    "it is also worthwhile to notice that according to our model , the unitarity bound ( [ eq : fmbound ] ) is not saturated at the lhc , however the blackness at the central impact parameter is bigger than at tevatron : @xmath29 .",
    "the diffractive cross section at the lhc is close to that found at tevatron @xcite . as seen in figure  [ diff - plot ]",
    ", @xmath19 is almost constant in the range starting from the tevatron energy .",
    "this is a unique prediction of our model which differs from the prediction of goulianos @xcite .",
    "however , both predictions give a similar result at the lhc energy .",
    "the asymptotic energy behaviour of the diffractive cross section can be found by inspecting formula ( [ eq : diff ] ) . for large values of the parameter @xmath14 , @xmath30 .",
    "thus with the logarithmic dependence on energy for both parameters , we obtain in the high energy limit @xmath31 we have also determined the elastic and diffractive slopes at the lhc in the range @xmath32 . in both scenarios we obtained practically the same values which are given in table  [ cs - results ] .    in summary",
    ", we applied the miettinen - pumplin model to the determination of the total , elastic and single diffractive cross sections at the lhc .",
    "based on the existing data , we extracted the energy dependence of two parameters in the model , which was subsequently extrapolated to the lhc energy . with the obtained energy dependence ,",
    "the froissart - martin bound is fulfilled . as main results ,",
    "the prediction for the total cross section at the lhc is @xmath27 smaller than that from the soft pomeron model of donnachie and landshoff , and the diffractive cross section is almost constant in the tevatron ",
    "lhc energy range .",
