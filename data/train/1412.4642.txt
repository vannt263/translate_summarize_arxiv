    "this paper theoretically investigates the effects of electromigration on morphological stability and evolution of a bi - component , atomically rough surface of a single - crystal metal or semiconductor film ( a generic substitutional binary alloy or a non - reactive compound ) .",
    "the prototype systems may be the al@xmath3cu@xmath4 or ag@xmath3pd@xmath4 grain of a microelectronic interconnect , or a si@xmath3ge@xmath4 thin film . here",
    "@xmath5 stands for the concentration of al , ag or si atoms . the electric field",
    "is assumed applied along the direction of the initially planar grain or film surface ( or parallel to a crystal step in the step dynamical setting ) , and the thin surface layer contains both atomic components .",
    "such direction of the application of the electric field induces faceting of the film surface , which was the subject of several studies of a single - component films @xcite,@xcite-@xcite,@xcite .    in microelectronic applications ,",
    "the performance and realiability of alloy interconnects depends in part on the distribution of the minority component @xcite .",
    "the electric current and associated heating of the interconnect may affect the minority component distribution within the surface layer and in the bulk of the grain .",
    "often a new phase(s ) is formed , which occurs primarily at the grain boundaries . as interconnects dimensions approach the nanoscale , their resistance to electromigration - caused degradation",
    "is expected to diminish @xcite-@xcite,@xcite , thus understanding how film morphology is affected by electromigration is still important . also , despite the apparent importance of a second atomic component ,",
    "there have been no attempts to theoretically understand how its electromigration - driven surface diffusion affects the spatio - temporal distribution of the alloy components and the evolution of surface morphology .",
    "this paper is aimed to partially fill this gap .",
    "we assume a simple one - dimensional geometry , where the surface is an open curve ( without overhangs ) in the @xmath6 plane , described by a function @xmath7 . the surface diffusional mobilities @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are two types of mobile adatoms , are usually anisotropic due to the undelying crystal lattice @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath12 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the surface orientation angle and the arclength @xmath15 is the position variable ( see figure [ geom ] ) .",
    "as was noted , our local model assumes that the constant electric field vector @xmath16 is directed along the substrate .",
    "the component of @xmath16 that is parallel to the surface is the origin of the electromigration force on adatoms .",
    "thus the electromigration force is a function of the surface orientation angle @xmath14 ; and since @xmath14 changes from point to point on the surface , it follows that the force depends on the arclength @xmath15 ( and thus it depends on @xmath17 ) .",
    "we also assume :    * the post - deposition scenario , when the surface shape changes by the natural , high - temperature surface diffusion of adatoms ( which arises due to a non - uniformity of the surface chemical potential @xmath18 along the surface ) , and by the electromigration - driven surface diffusion @xcite ; * surface orientation independent ( isotropic ) and composition independent surface energies @xmath19 ( thus @xmath20 ) .",
    "typical solid films feature anisotropic and ( weakly ) composition - dependent surface energies @xmath21 , but in the presence of the electric field ( which sets up a preferred direction for adatoms diffusion ) it is expected that these effects are less important than the effects caused by the anisotropy of the diffusional mobilities .",
    "morphological evolution with the anisotropic surface energy has been extensively studied , see for instance @xcite ; * equal , i.e. the same value and sign , effective charges of @xmath10 and @xmath11-type adatoms .",
    "this leads to the simpler forms of the governing equations and the reduction from six to five in the number of independent parameters of the dimensionless problem .",
    "even when the effective charges are of the same sign , as is generally expected , it is quite reasonable to assume that their values ratio may be as large as 100 .",
    "thus we will report separately on the results of the analysis of the full problem where this assumption is relaxed .",
    "furthermore , the stresses in the film are ignored ; this includes thermal , compositional and heteroepitaxial stresses .",
    "let @xmath22 and @xmath23 be the dimensionless surface concentrations of adatoms @xmath10 and @xmath11 , defined as the products of a volumetric number densities and the atomic volume",
    ". then @xmath24 , and it is sufficient to determine the concentration of one adatom type , say , @xmath23 .",
    "the model that we develop is aimed at the description and understanding of the conditions leading to destabilization of the initially planar surface and the time - evolution of the surface shape and composition after the destabilization occured .",
    "the surface shape @xmath25 and the concentration @xmath23 will be determined from an initial - boundary value problem for a system of two coupled , well - posed parabolic partial differential equations ( pdes ) . to this end",
    ", our model is largely rooted in the theoretical framework developed by spencer , voorhees , and tersoff @xcite for the analysis of the morphological evolution of the surfaces of a bi - component , heteroepitaxial thin films .",
    "the major attraction of this model is that each component is allowed to diffuse independently on the surface , which permits to determine the impact of each component diffusional mobility ( and its anisotropy ) .",
    "as was already mentioned , this anisotropy is the important factor in surface electromigration phenomena @xcite-@xcite,@xcite .    from geometry ,",

    "we studied the electromigration - driven evolution of the surface morphology and composition for a bi - component solid film using a minimal and local model , which is nonetheless formulated as a coupled system of two heavily nonlinear parabolic pdes .",
    "both equations of this system reduce to the standard fourth - order surface evolution equation @xcite when the bi - component film is replaced by a single - component film , the electric field is turned off , and the diffusional mobility is isotropic .    through lsa and computation",
    "we established the parametric dependencies of the key quantities .",
    "our results show the long - wavelength instability coupled to the lateral drift of the perturbations .",
    "the most dangerous wavelength @xmath124 and the growth rate @xmath179 scale as @xmath180 and @xmath181 , respectively , where @xmath66 is the applied electric field parameter .",
    "these scalings coincide with those obtained by schimschak and krug @xcite using a nonlocal electric field model .",
    "however , scalings of @xmath124 and @xmath179 with the first derivative of the diffusional mobilities are different from ref .",
    "@xcite ; there , they also scale as power law , @xmath182 , while in our model the dependence is closer to exponential . from the computations of surface morphology coarsening",
    ", we noticed that the characteristic exponents vary depending on which parameter is studied , but in most cases the exponents are at least two times smaller than the approximate value 1/4 reported by krug and dobbs @xcite for the single - component film using the same local electric field model as ours .",
    "it is not clear from their paper whether this value is universal , i.e. does not depend on parameters .",
    "the hills slopes are constant @xmath183 during coarsening , which is rather close to the @xmath184 reported by krug and dobbs . finally , we noticed fast growth of the exponent in the terminal stages of coarsening with significantly different values of the anisotropy strength in the expressions for the diffusional mobilities of the two components . in these cases",
    "the surface layer becomes nearly homogeneous at the end of the computation due to enrichment by either @xmath10 or @xmath11 component , thus the growth of the exponent is consistent with the previous statement .",
