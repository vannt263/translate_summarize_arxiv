    "<S> we argue that , in contrast to the non - relativistic approach , a relativistic evaluation of the nucleon  hole and delta - isobar  nucleon hole contributions to the pion self - energy incorporates the s - wave scattering , which requires a more accurate evaluation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore relativistic approach containing only these diagrams does not describe appropriately the pion self - energy in isospin symmetric nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , a correct relativistic approach to the pion self - energy should involve a more sophisticated calculation in order to satisfy the known experimental results on the near - threshold behaviour of the @xmath0-nucleon ( forward ) scattering amplitude .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs number(s ) : 24.10.cn ; 13.75cs ; 21.65.+f ; 25.70.-z    originated from experiments with relativistic heavy - ion collisions , considerable efforts from many theoretical groups were made in relativistic approaches to the pion self - energy in isospin symmetric nuclear matter ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> basically such calculations , involving relativistic kinematics , are restricted to the contributions from nucleon particle  hole ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath2-isobar  nucleon hole ( @xmath2h ) excitations in the medium , as given by the following diagrams :    here the @xmath2-isobar is shown by double line . </S>",
    "<S> the shadowed effective vertices for the pion interaction with nucleons and deltas take into account the correlations in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> these vertices are irreducible with respect to pion lines .    </S>",
    "<S> as has been pointed by many authors , such calculations yield a pion self - energy @xmath3 , which , in the low - density limit , does not reproduce exactly the pion self - energy obtained from the non - relativistic reduction of the pion - nucleon and pion - delta lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this letter is to illuminate the reason of this discrepancy , by showing that a relativistic approach containing only the above diagrams does not describe the pion self - energy appropriately .    in the following </S>",
    "<S> we employ the widely used pseudovector interaction of pions with nucleons and deltas . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding lagrangian density can be written in the following form@xmath4here @xmath5 is the pseudoscalar isovector pion field , @xmath6 is the bare pion mass , and @xmath7 is the pion - nucleon coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> the excitation of the @xmath2 in pion - nucleon scattering is described by the last two terms in the lagrangian with the chew - low value of the coupling constant , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleon field is denoted as @xmath9 , and @xmath10 stands for the rarita - schwinger spinor of the @xmath11-baryon . here and below , we denote as @xmath12 the isospin @xmath13 operators , which act on the isobaric doublet @xmath14 of the nucleon field . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2-barion is an isospin @xmath15 particle represented by a quartet of four states . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 are the isospin transition operators between the isospin @xmath17 and @xmath15 fields .    the non - relativistic reduction of the pion - nucleon and pion - delta coupling , given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lp ] ) , leads to an effective interaction hamiltonian of the form ( see e. g. @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath18where @xmath19 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath20 are the transition spin operators connecting spin @xmath17 and @xmath15 states .    to show explicitly the above - mentioned problem we perform a relativistic and non - relativistic calculation of the pion self - energy in a simple model , where the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 correlations are simulated by phenomenological contact interactions with three landau - migdal parameters , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> ( for details of the calculation see @xcite . ) modern experiments and theoretical estimates @xcite , @xcite , ari01 point out that @xmath25 must be essentially smaller than @xmath24 and @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the most recent analysis , reported in @xcite , suggest @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 . while we will do not discuss possible deviations from this set of landau - migdal parameters , let us investigate the behaviour of the pion self - energy in this case .    0.3 cm    0.3 cm in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , the solid line presents the pion self - energy as obtained in relativistic calculations . for a comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line shows the pion self - energy calculated in the non - relativistic approach . </S>",
    "<S> as one can see , even for @xmath31 , we obtain a large discrepamcy . </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic calculation results in an increasing of the pion self - energy along with @xmath32 , while in the non - relativistic approach the pion self - energy vanishes when @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> one can easily find that the discrepancy arises even at the lowest - order level :    consider , for example , the particle - hole contribution , as given by the first one - loop diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic evaluation yields ( see e.g. @xcite):@xmath33where @xmath34 is the effective nucleon mass , @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the nucleon fermi momentum , and @xmath37 is the pion four - momentum .    </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to analyse the low - density limit of this expression in order to compare with the known non - relativistic form . at low density of nucleons , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 , one has @xmath39 . with this replacement , </S>",
    "<S> the integration can be performed to give @xmath40where @xmath41is the migdal function , with @xmath42this non - relativistic limit for the lowest - order particle - hole self - energy has been obtained from relativistic kinematics . as given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rph ] ) , for @xmath43 and in the limiting case of @xmath44 , we have : @xmath45with @xmath46being the number density of isosymmetric nuclear matter . the corresponding relativistic calculation of the lowest - order @xmath47 loop gives an expression , which , in the low - density limit and @xmath43 , takes the following form @xcite:@xmath48a comparison of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nnnr ] ) and eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ndnr ] ) with the non - relativistic form of the lowest - order pion self - energy @xcite@xmath49shows that the relativistic evaluation results in additional contributions , which do not vanish when @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , one finds@xmath50    to explain the origin of these terms we recall that the pion self - energy represents the forward scattering amplitude of the pion in the medium . in the non - relativistic theory , the above @xmath1 and @xmath47 diagrams , taking also into account the correlations in the medium , are known to reproduce well the ( forward ) p - scattering amplitude in the isospin symmetric nuclear matter , while the s - scattering contribution is known to be small . due to the non - relativistic reduction of @xmath51 interaction , as given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h ] ) , the s - wave scattering gives no contribution to the @xmath1 and @xmath47 diagrams .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the relativistic form of the pion - nucleon and pion - delta interactions , as given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lp ] ) , causes an s - wave contribution to the above diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> consider , for example , the @xmath51 interaction . at the pion four - momentum @xmath52 , </S>",
    "<S> these couplings involve only the time component of the currents . in the low - density limit , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 , the matrix element @xmath53 is proportional to @xmath54 , and the non - relativistic reduction , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h ] ) , of the @xmath55 interaction implyes that the part of the scattering amplitude generated by @xmath56 at the second order vanishes for nucleons at rest . however , this is not the case , if the time component of the interaction is relativistically incorporated to the calculation of the @xmath1 and @xmath47 diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> integration over the nucleon momentum results in the contribution , proportional to @xmath57 as given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dif ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , in contrast to non - relativistic approach , relativistic evaluation of the @xmath1 and @xmath47 contributions to the pion self - energy incorporates the s - wave scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this means that a covariant relativistic evaluation of the pion self - energy can not be restricted only to the @xmath1 and @xmath47 diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> a correct calculation of the ( forward ) s - wave amplitude actually requires the inclusion of many more complicated diagrams , since the s - scattering is caused mostly by the short - distance interactions , @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> when these diagrams are included , one can expect a very strong cancellation of the s - wave contribution to the pion self - energy . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for example , at the threshold @xmath59 , from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nnnr ] ) and eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ndnr ] ) we obtain the forward s - scattering amplitude as @xmath60the correlation effects , as well as a reasonable variation of the effective nucleon ( and delta ) mass , do not change the order of magnitude of this result . </S>",
    "<S> when the short - range correlations are taken into account we obtain @xmath61chiral symmetry , however , imposes strong constraints on the near - threshold behaviour of this isospin even amplitude @xcite and it is known experimentally @xcite , @xcite to be much smaller , as compared to that given by eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ srel ] ) and eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ srel1 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> thus one can conclude that , due to the s - wave contribution , a correct relativistic approach to the pion self - energy would involve a more sophisticated calculation , including some extra diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> a strong cancellation of the s - wave contribution should be expected in this way , so as to satisfy the above experimental results . </S>"
