    "if @xmath113 is a seifert fibered space then the map @xmath56 descends to a nonzero degree map from the orbifold @xmath116 of @xmath113 to the orbifold @xmath117 of @xmath52 and thus one can compare the volume of @xmath113 and @xmath52 .",
    "when @xmath113 is not a seifert fibered space , we use the decomposition stated in section 3 which cut @xmath113 into a thick part @xmath118 and a thin part @xmath119 .",
    "more precisely , the results proved in section 3 allow to assume that there exists a family of vertical tori @xmath120 in @xmath52 such that ( after a homotopy ) @xmath121 and , @xmath122 is a fiber preserving map .",
    "when the tori of the family @xmath120 are pairwise disjoint then it can be shown that the contribution of @xmath123 is negligible to produce the volume of the image of @xmath56 and thus we prove that @xmath124 .",

    "but when the tori of the family @xmath120 are not pairwise disjoint the above arguments do not hold and the contribution of the map @xmath123 may be non - trivial and hence we have to construct a convenient _ orbifold complex _ to compare the volumes .    more precisely , for any seifert piece @xmath29 in @xmath118",
    "the map @xmath125 descends to a map from the base orbifold @xmath30 of @xmath29 to @xmath117 but when @xmath29 is a seifert piece of @xmath119 the map @xmath125 does not factors throught the base 2-orbifolds in general .",

    "then consider the surface @xmath134 which dominates @xmath133 by construction .",
    "note that @xmath135 is naturally divided into a thick part @xmath136 and a thin part @xmath137 that is itself divided into the union @xmath138 and the standard form of section 3 allows to construct a graph @xmath139 embedded in @xmath135 such that @xmath140 dominates @xmath133 where @xmath141 .",
    "then the key point of this case is to prove that the dominating map @xmath142 descends to a dominating map @xmath143 .",
    "when @xmath52 has a @xmath115-structure then we have no horizontal surface and the problem is more delicate . in this case",
    "we consider the space @xmath144 obtained from @xmath52 after removing a regular neighborhood of a regular fiber . then using the standard form for",

    "@xmath156 then it is sufficient to check that @xmath157 .",
    "this inequality can be directly checked when the genus @xmath158 of the base 2-orbifolds of some seifert pieces @xmath29 of @xmath128 is sufficiently large . in the general case ,",
    "we use some results on subgroup separability of haken manifolds groups of e. hamilton , and k. gruenberg and a system of horizontal surfaces to construct a finite covering @xmath159 of @xmath56 satisfying the condition on the genus .",
    "this proves that @xmath160 .",
    "note that the finite covering has to be chosen carefully so that the above inequality descends to a strict inequality @xmath155 .",
    "this latter point can be achieved provided we control the difference between the fiber degree of @xmath161 and that of @xmath162 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the proof of theorems [ decroissance ] and [ rigide ] and corollary [ strong rigidity ] .",
    "note that in this paper all the 3-manifolds are orientable .",
    "in this section we first prove the invariance of the 2-dimensional simplicial volume .",
    "next we recall some well known facts on seifert fibered spaces and on haken manifolds which will be used throughout this paper .",
    "these results concern finite coverings and separability in haken manifolds groups .",
    "let @xmath52 be an orientable seifert fibered space .",

    "we prove lemma [ invariance ] . since the jsj - decomposition of closed haken manifolds is unique up",

    "<S> we introduce an invariant @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the gromov simplicial volume of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a 2-dimensional simplicial volume which measures the volume of the base 2-orbifolds of the seifert pieces of @xmath2 .    after studying the behavior of @xmath4 under nonzero degree maps action , we prove that if @xmath5 and @xmath2 are closed haken manifolds such that @xmath6 and @xmath7 then any non - zero degree map @xmath8 is homotopic to a covering map . </S>",
