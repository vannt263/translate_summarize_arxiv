    "the main analytical method used to treat the physics of interacting systems is perturbation theory . in this framework , _ bare _ , noninteracting , matter fields and gauge fields ( to which bare quanta are associated ) are introduced , the interaction being accounted for order by order in powers of the coupling constant in the perturbative expansion of the observables . for a long time , physicists have been aware that perturbative expansions have a limited scope , in spite of all the remarkable achievements obtained with them .",
    "some examples of such situations are resonant effects associated to the coupling of atoms to strong radiofrequency fields , or the low - energy domain of quantum chromodynamics , where confinement of quarks and gluons takes place . along the last decades",
    ", many attempts were devised to circumvent the limitations of perturbation theory , in particular when strong effective couplings are involved .    in any case , as a matter of principle , due to the nonvanishing of the coupling constant , the idea of a bare particle associated to a bare matter field is actually an artifact of perturbation theory and strictly speaking is physically meaningless . in general , a charged physical particle is always coupled to a gauge field ; in other words , it is always `` dressed '' by a cloud of quanta of the gauge field , for instance , photons in the case of electrodynamics .    with respect to the time evolution of systems of ( matter )",
    "particles , the idea is that particles are coupled to an environment or to a thermal bath .",
    "there are usually two equivalent ways of modeling the environment to which the particle is coupled : either to represent it by a free field , as was done in refs .",
    "@xcite , or to consider the environment as a reservoir composed of a large number of noninteracting harmonic oscillators ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in both cases ,",
    "exactly the same type of argument given above for a charged particle applies , making the appropriate changes , to these systems .",
    "we may speak of a `` dressing '' of the set of particles by the ensemble of the harmonic modes of the environment .",
    "the particles in the system are considered as always `` dressed '' by a cloud of quanta of the environment .",
    "this is true in general for any system in which material particles are coupled to an environment , no matter what the specific nature of the environment and interaction involved are .    in the present work",
    "we adopt this point of view and consider a harmonic oscillator , coupled linearly to an environment modeled by the infinite set of harmonic modes of a scalar field , the whole system being contained in a perfectly reflecting sphere of radius @xmath0 .",
    "we implement a nonperturbative study of the time evolution of a superposition of the first excited and the ground states of the oscillator , by means of the _ dressed _ states introduced in @xcite and already employed to investigate several situations @xcite .",

    ", the oscillator may represent a mode of the quantized electromagnetic field in a cavity interacting with the environment ; in this case , our study refers to the time evolution of the superposition of the ground state and the first excited state of the field in the cavity .",
    "the model in itself is not new ; a system composed of a material body interacting linearly with an environment has been the main subject of many papers , as those quoted in refs .",
    "the novelty lies in the nonperturbative approach to the problem , by means of _ renormalized _ coordinates and _ dressed _ states , which was started in @xcite . in particular , our dressed states are _ not _ the same as those employed in the literature , usually associated to normal coordinates .",
    "our dressed states are given in terms of our _ renormalized _ coordinates and allow a rigorous study of the time evolution of quantum systems .",
