    "in recent years , many authors have focused their attention on the proposition of new and more flexible distribution functions , constructed using various transformation techniques such as , for example , the beta - generated distribution by @xcite and @xcite , the gamma - generated distribution by @xcite , kumaraswamy - generated distribution by @xcite , mcdonald - generated distribution by @xcite , @xcite , weibull - generated distribution by @xcite , just to name a few .",
    "such transformation techniques may be viewed as special cases of the transformed - transformer method proposed by @xcite .",
    "other proposals are based on the azzalini s method @xcite and its extensions @xcite . using these techniques , many of the known distributions such as , for example , normal , exponential , weibull , logistics , pareto , dagum , singh - maddala , etc .",
    ", have been generalized .",
    "+ almost all these new proposals concern distributions with unbounded support . in the face of the numerous proposals of distributions with unbounded support emerges , undoubtedly , the great scarcity of distributions with bounded support ( * ? ? ?",
    "473 ) , although there are many real - life situations in which the observations clearly can take values only in a limited range , such as percentages , proportions or fractions .",
    "@xcite claim that variables bounded between zero and one arise naturally in many economic setting ; _",
    "e.g. _ the fraction of total weekly hours spent working , the proportion of income spent on non - durable consumption , pension plan participation rates , industry market shares , television rating , fraction of land area allocate to agriculture , etc .",
    "various examples of proportions in the unit interval used in empirical finance are discussed in @xcite .",
    "+ also in reliability analysis , different authors refer to continuous models with finite support in order to describe lifetime data .",
    "this is often motivated by considering physical reasons such as the finite lifetime of a component or the bounded signals occurring in industrial systems ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this perspective , the models with infinite support can be viewed as an approximation of the realty .",
    "furthermore , when the realiability is measured as percentage or ratio , it is important to have models defined on the unit interval @xcite in order to have plausible results .",
    "+ it is well known that the most used distribution to model continuous variables in the unit interval is the beta distribution .",
    "the popularity of this distribution is certainly due to the great flexibility of its density function , in fact it can take different forms such as constant , increasing , decreasing , unimodal and uniantimodal depending on the values of its parameters .",
    "this distribution has been used in various fields of science such as , for example , biology , ecology , engineering , economics , demography , finance , etc .",
    "( for a detailed discussion see @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "mathematical difficulties underlying the use of this model , due to the fact that its distribution function can not be expressed in closed form and its determination involves the incomplete beta function ratio , are well known .",
    "+ recently , several authors have proposed an alternative to the beta distribution by recovering the distribution proposed by kumaraswamy in 1980 in the context of hydrology studies .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , kumaraswamy s distribution has many of the properties of the beta distribution and some advantages in terms of tractability , in particular its distribution function has a closed form and it does not involve any special function .",
    "in fact , this distribution turns out to be a special case of the generalized beta of the first type proposed by @xcite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps thanks to a work of @xcite , a renewed interest has been recently developed for another distribution defined on bounded support , the topp - leone ( _ tl _ ) distribution , proposed by @xcite and successively studied by different authors ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also in the reliability context @xcite .",
    "starting from a generalized version of the _ tl _ distribution , @xcite proposed the reflected generalized topp - leone ( _ rgtl _ ) distribution . similarly to the beta distribution , this distribution has a density that can be constant , increasing , decreasing , unimodal and uniantimodal , depending on the values of its parameters .",
    "moreover , it has a strictly positive density value at its lower bound and a closed form of its distribution function .",
    "however , the hazard function of the _ rgtl _ shows a certain rigidity since it is always increasing .",
    "this fact is a real weakness of the model , in particular in the field of reliability theory and survival analysis .    with the aim to propose a new flexible model defined on the unit interval , in this paper we consider the standard _",
    "rgtl _ distribution and introduce the reflected generalized topp - leone power series ( _ rgtl - ps _ ) class of distributions , obtained by compounding the power series distributions and the standard _",
    "rgtl_.    in the recent literature , many new distributions are obtained by compounding a continuous distribution with a discrete one .",
    "an interesting motivation of this procedure can be found in the process underlying the failure of a series system composed by @xmath0 component .",
    "if @xmath1 is the lifetime for the @xmath2 component , the system will fail when the first component fails , so the lifetime of the whole system is @xmath3 . in this situation , assuming that the lifetimes of the components are independent , it is easy to obtain the probability of failure for the system by compounding the distribution of @xmath4 s and the distribution of @xmath0 , as follows : @xmath5=\\\\ & = & 1-\\sum_{z=0}^{\\infty } p(y_1>y)p(y_2>y) ...",
    "p(y_n > y)p(z = z).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by considering different cumulative distribution functions for @xmath0 and for @xmath1 , various models are proposed during the last years .",
    "it is the case , for example , of the exponential - geometric distribution @xcite , of the exponential - poisson - lindley distribution @xcite and of the exponential - logarithmic distribution @xcite , to name a few .",
    "other distributions , such as the weibull power series @xcite , are obtained by describing the random variable @xmath0 through the power series distribution , or by considering a similar procedure to that just mentioned , involving the maximum rather than the minimum of the lifetimes @xcite .",
    "the _ rgtl - ps _ distribution obtained preserves the main advantage of the _ rgtl _ distribution with respect to the beta distribution , that is its cumulative distribution function has a closed form and therefore the quantile functions are easily obtainable and one can easily generate a random variable from _ rgtl - ps _ distribution . furthermore , the _ rgtl - ps _ density function has an analogous flexibility of the beta density function , _",
    "i.e. _ the shape of density can be increasing , decreasing , unimodal and uniantimodal .",
    "finally , the shape of the hazard , besides being increasing and bathtub as the beta distribution , also shows a n - shape ( very useful in the context of reliability theory , see for example , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these properties characterize our proposal as a valid alternative to the beta distribution .",

    "+        [ fig : dens_capacity ]    _ example 2 .",
    "_ in this example , we consider the proportions of muslim population in 152 countries and the proportion of atheists of 137 countries .",
    "these datasets have been considered by @xcite with the aim to select the best model between the beta and the kumaraswamy .",
    "along these two models , we also consider _ rgtl - log _ , _ rgtl - geo _ and _ rgtl - poi _ models .",
    "the _ ml _ estimates of the parameters , with the corresponding standard errors , and the values for aic are reported in table [ stime2 ] . in both cases ,",
    "the _ rgtl - log _ model appears to be the best model , as suggested by the lowest value for the aic .",
    "we note that , for the atheism dataset , also the _ rgtl - geo _ seems to have a better performance than the beta and kumaraswamy distributions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens_ex2 ] the fitted densities for the considered models are shown .",
    "in many fields of applied science , the observations take values only in a limited range , it is the case , for example , of percentages , proportions and fractions . to model this type of data",
    ", the statistical literature offers very few alternatives , mainly the beta distribution and only recently some authors have recovered the topp - leone distribution , proposed in 1955 , and the kumuraswamy distribution , introduced in literature in 1980 .",
    "certainly , the lack in the literature of distributions with bounded support contrasts with the huge presence of distributions with unbounded support . with the aim to reduce this gap , in this paper",
    "we have proposed a new class of distribution functions with limited support , namely _ rgtl - ps _ , obtained by compounding the power series distributions and the reflected generalized topp - leone distribution . the proposed class",
    "includes , as special cases , some new distributions with limited support such as the _ rgtl - logarithmic _ , _ the rgtl - geometric _ , the _ rgtl - poisson _ and _ rgtl - binomial_.    like the beta distribution , the shape of the _ rgtl - ps _ density function can be constant , increasing , decreasing , unimodal and uniantimodal depending on the values of its parameters . unlike the beta distribution ,",
    "the hazard function of _ rgtl - ps _ is much more flexible since it can be increasing , bathtub and n - shape .",
    "moreover , the main advantage with respect to the beta distribution is represented by the fact that the proposed model presents a distribution function in a closed form and the quantiles can be easly obtained .",
