    "because the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking has yet to be confirmed , the search for a standard - model ( sm ) higgs boson represents a significant issue in fermilab s tevatron physics program . both and cdf have recently reported searches for higgs bosons that combined different final states and production modes@xcite .    in this note , we combine results of all such searches from cdf and  for  collisions at  .",
    "these searches are for sm higgs bosons produced in association with vector bosons (  or ) or singly through gluon - gluon fusion ( ) .",
    "the results are for data corresponding to integrated luminosities ranging from 360 - 1000  at cdf and 260 - 950  at .",
    "the searches are separated into sixteen final states , referred to as analyses in the following . to simplify combination of signals , the analyses are separated into sixteen mutually exclusive final states .",
    "selection procedures for each analysis are detailed in each of the experiment s reports@xcite , and briefly described below .",
    "selections are similar for the corresponding cdf and analyses . for the case of , an isolated lepton ( electron or muon ) and at least two jets are required , with one or more jets tagged as originating from @xmath3-quarks .",
    "two orthogonal tagging criteria are defined , one being an exclusive single - tag ( st ) and the other a double - tag(dt ) selection .",
    "these events must also display a significant imbalance of momentum in the plane transverse to the beam axis ( referred to as missing energy or ) .",
    "events with additional isolated leptons are vetoed .",
    "for the  analyses , the selection is similar , except all events with isolated leptons are vetoed and stronger multijet background suppression techniques are applied . as there is a sizable amount of  signal that can mimic the  final state when the lepton is undetected , the  analyses include this as a separate search , referred to as .",
    "cdf includes this as part of the acceptance of the  search . in the  and  analyses ,",
    "the final variable used for setting a cross section limit is the dijet invariant mass .",
    "the  analyses require two isolated leptons and two jets , wherein the cdf analysis requires at least one of the jets to be @xmath3-tagged while the  analysis uses only events with two @xmath3-tags .",
    "for the analysis the dijet invariant mass is used for setting limits while cdf uses the output of a 2-dimensional neural network to discriminate between signal and background . for the  analyses , a large  and two opposite - signed , isolated leptons ( electrons or muons )",
    "are selected , defining three final states ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ) .",
    "the presence of neutrinos in the final state prevents the direct reconstruction of the higgs mass , and the final variable used is the difference in @xmath7 between the two final - state leptons .",
    "the experiment also contributes three  analyses , where the associated @xmath8 boson and the same - charged @xmath8 boson from the higgs decay semi - leptonically , thereby defining six final states containing all decays of the third @xmath8 boson ( of opposite charge ) . in this case of this analysis , the final variable is a likelihood discriminant formed from several topological variables .",
    "all higgs signals are simulated using pythia v6.202@xcite , using cteq5l@xcite leading order parton distribution functions .",
    "the signal cross sections are normalized to next - to - next - to - leading order calculations@xcite , and branching ratios from hdecay@xcite . for both cdf and , events from multijet ( instrumental ) backgrounds ( `` qcd production '' )",
    "are measured in data , but with different methods .",
    "for cdf , inherent backgrounds from other sm processes were generated using pythia , alpgen@xcite , and herwig@xcite programs .",
    "for , inherent backgrounds were generated using pythia , alpgen , and comphep@xcite , with pythia providing parton - showering and hadronization for all the generators .",
    "background processes were normalized using either experimental data or next - to - leading order calculations from mcfm@xcite .",
    "values of integrated luminosity , and expected signal , expected background , and observed events are given in table  [ tab : cdfacc ] for cdf analyses and tables  [ tab : dzacc1]-[tab : dzacc3 ] for analyses .",
    "the numbers of events are integrated in the range @xmath9200  gev / c@xmath2 for  analyses , @xmath10 for  analyses , and @xmath11 for the  analyses .",
