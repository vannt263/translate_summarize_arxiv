    "multi - resolution representations of discrete data are useful tools in several areas of application as image compression or adaptive methods for partial differential equations . in these applications ,",
    "the ability of these representations to approximate the input data with high accuracy using a very small set of coefficients is a central property .",
    "moreover , the stability of these representations in presence of perturbations ( generated by compression or due to approximations ) is a key point . + in the last decade , several attempts to improve the property of classical linear multi - resolutions have lead to nonlinear multi - resolutions . in many cases ,",
    "this nonlinear nature hinders the proofs of convergence and stability .",
    "+ in @xcite , in the context of image compression , a new multi - resolution transform has been presented .",
    "this multi - resolution is based on an univariate nonlinear multi - resolution called pph multi - resolution ( see @xcite in the context of convexity preserving ) .",
    "it has been analyzed in terms of convergence and stability of an associated subdivision scheme following an approach for data dependent multi - resolutions introduced in @xcite .",
    "due to nonlinearity , the stability of the pph multi - resolution is not a consequence of the convergence of the associated subdivision scheme .",
    "it has been established in @xcite , presenting the pph subdivision scheme as some perturbation of a linear scheme following @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "+ the aim of the present paper is to generalize the results presented in @xcite for a general family of nonlinear multi - resolution schemes associated to an interpolatory subdivision scheme @xmath0 of the form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a nonlinear operator defined on @xmath3 , @xmath4 is a linear and continuous operator on @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a linear and convergent subdivision scheme . considering two subdivision schemes @xmath7 and @xmath6",
    ", it is always possible to introduce the difference @xmath8 . if one assume some properties of polynomial reproduction ( see section [ sec3 ] ) , as shown in @xcite , @xmath2 is in fact a function of differences , i.e. of @xmath9 defined by @xmath10 .",
    "theorems [ th1 ] and [ th5 ] , that are the main results of this paper , establish that if @xmath11 and @xmath4 satisfy some natural properties , then the subdivision scheme is convergent and the multi - resolution is stable . + the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we recall briefly the harten s interpolatory multi - resolution framework which is the natural setting for our work .",
    "we precise the class of schemes under consideration and we establish the main results in section [ sec3 ] .",
