    "colloidal suspensions have numerous applications in different fields such as chemistry , biology , medicine , and engineering . in an aqueous solution ,",
    "colloidal particles are often charged , either by ionization or dissociation of a surface group , or preferential adsorption of ions from the solution .",
    "therefore , they can be efficiently controlled or manipulated by electric fields .",
    "electric fields can be applied in two different ways .",
    "one is to use static ( dc ) fields which induce electrophoresis , _",
    "i.e. _ , the migration of individual colloids @xcite .",
    "electrophoresis is commonly used to measure the surface charge density of colloidal particles .",
    "the other possibility is alternating electric field ( ac field ) .",
    "the time - dependent perturbation allows one to selectively probe dynamic phenomena at different time scales and produces substantially more information than just probing the response to a static field @xcite .",
    "the colloids respond to external fields on relatively short time scales and in an often fully reversible way .",
    "one important quantity characterizing the dynamic response of the colloid is the electrophoretic mobility .",
    "if an external electric field of the form @xmath0 is applied in the @xmath1-direction , the @xmath1-component of the colloid velocity exhibits an oscillation of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 can be a complex number . for weak fields ,",
    "the frequency of the colloid motion is the same as the external field , and the response depends linearly on the strength of the perturbation .",
    "the amplitude of the colloid velocity then can be written as @xmath4 the mobility @xmath5 is in general a complex number , whose magnitude characterizes the sensitivity of the response , _",
    "i.e. _ , how fast the colloid moves under fixed external field , and the phase describes the synchronization between the response and perturbation , _",
    "i.e. _ , whether the colloid motion is in phase with the external field .",
    "we explicitly include the argument @xmath6 to emphasize that the mobility is a function of the driving frequency .",
    "the microions , which include the counterions from the surface charge and the dissolved salt molecules in the solution , play an important role in determining the colloidal response to the external field .",
    "counterions accumulate around the colloid surface due to the electrostatic attraction between opposite charges and form an electric double layer ( edl ) . in close vicinity of the colloid ,",
    "the counterions stick to the surface and move together with the colloid .",
    "further away , microions are relatively mobile and experience thermal motion .",
    "the thickness of the electric double layer is characterized by the debye screening length @xmath7^{-\\frac{1}{2}},\\ ] ] where the summation runs over different ion types . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : debye ] ) , @xmath8 is the bjerrum length which depends on the medium permittivity @xmath9 and the temperature of the solution @xmath10 , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the valence and bulk concentration for type @xmath13 ion , respectively .",
    "when an external electric field is applied to the suspension , both the colloidal particle and its surrounding electric double layer will be polarized .",
    "the colloid acquires a dipole moment of the form @xmath14 in the direction of the applied field , and the amplitude the dipole moment can be written as @xmath15 the polarizability @xmath16 is used to characterize the colloid s dielectric response to the external fields , and it is a complex function of the frequency and the amplitude of the external field . in the linear response region ,",
    "the dipole moment is proportional to the magnitude of the external field ; thus the polarizability does not depend on the field strength for weak external fields .",
    "the response of the colloid to the external field , be it dynamic ( [ eq : mu_def ] ) or dielectric ( [ eq : alpha_def ] ) , is a combined effect of hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions .",
    "we can control the response by adjusting various factors such as the surface charge density of the colloid and the salt concentration .",
    "_ observed a salt - dependent change of sign in the mobility of the condensed counterions in polyelectrolyte solutions @xcite .",
    "similar phenomena are observed in our colloidal system , and the mobility change can also be induced by varying the colloid charges .",
    "furthermore , we explore the response to alternating electric fields , and systematically study the frequency - dependence of mobility and polarizability .",
    "various theories have been proposed to understand the frequency - dependent response of colloid dispersions . already for uncharged colloids ,",
    "this response is far from trivial @xcite . on the mhz scale ,",
    "the main contribution to the induced dipole moments stems from the conductivity mismatch between the particle and the solvent due to the presence of the free microions in the solvent .",
    "the so - called maxwell - wagner relaxation @xcite only depends on the bulk properties of the solution and the colloid , and has been widely used to interpret experimental results @xcite . for charged colloids",
    ", the electric double layer plays an important role , and its contribution can be included in the maxwell - wagner theory as a surface conductivity term , which was first introduced by okonski @xcite .",
    "the maxwell - wagner - okonski theory has also been extended to ellipsoidal colloids @xcite . on long time",
    "scales up to 100 mhz , a salt concentration gradient builds up along the colloid and the thickness of the double layer varies accordingly , leading to an additional source of polarization ( @xmath17-polarization ) .",
    "theories for the low - frequency response have been developed in the ukraine school @xcite based on the standard electrokinetic model .",
    "their analytic results rely on the assumption that the electric double layer is much thinner than the radius of the colloid .",
    "this is justified for micrometer - sized colloids , but becomes questionable for particles of nanometer radius . for situations that involve thick electrical double layers and the whole frequency spectrum",
    ", one can solve the full electrokinetic equations using various numerical methods @xcite .",
    "using molecular dynamic simulations to study macroion solutions under alternating electric fields is a relatively new approach ; only a few works in the literature have tackled this subject .",
    "most studies have focused on the conformation change of a single polyelectrolyte ( pe ) chain .",
    "_ studied the unfolding and collapse of a flexible pe chain under a sinusoidal electric field @xcite .",
    "examined a similar system , but in trivalent salt solutions under a square - wave electric field @xcite .",
    "_ investigated the dynamics of an anchored pe chain , for both flexible and semiflexible cases @xcite .",
    "the detection of dna sequences using an ac - field in a nanopore capacitor was discussed in ref .",
    "a langevin thermostat was used in most studies , because the hydrodynamic interactions were taken to be screened for long pe chains in solutions with high salt concentration . for the system of nanometer - sized colloids ,",
    "hydrodynamic interactions are important , and we include coarse - grained solvent particles .    simulations with explicit solvents and microions are numerically challenging , because both the hydrodynamic and the electrostatic interactions are long - ranged . in recent years",
    ", a number of coarse - grained simulation methods have been developed to address this class of problem .",
    "the general idea is to couple the explicit charges with a mesoscopic model for navier - stokes fluids .",
    "there are a few choices of the fluid model in the literature , such as the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method @xcite , multi - particle collision dynamics ( mpcd ) @xcite , and dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use the particle - based dpd approach .",
    "dpd is a coarse - grained simulation method which is galilean invariant and conserves momentum .",
    "since it is a particle - based method , microions can be introduced in a straightforward manner . a recent comparative study @xcite indicated that the electrostatic interaction is the most expensive part in terms of the computational cost . therefore ,",
    "for intermediate or high salt concentrations , different methods for modelling the fluid becomes comparable .    in this work ,",
    "we study the response of the charged colloidal particle and its surrounding ionic clouds under external electric fields . in a recent publication @xcite ,",
    "we have presented first results on the frequency - dependent dielectric response of a colloid in solutions of high ionic strength . in that case , the results were in qualitative agreement with the prediction of the maxwell - wagner theory . here , we systematically vary the salt concentration down to the low - salt regime where the maxwell - wagner theory no longer applies , and analyze the contributions of microions to the dynamic and dielectric response .",
    "we use dpd simulations , including in full the hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we give a brief introduction to the simulation model and describe important parameters for the system .",
    "we present the simulation results on the mobility and polarizability in section [ sec : mu ] and [ sec : alpha ] , respectively .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : summary ] with a brief summary .",

    "we systematically vary some important parameters , such as the salt concentration , the colloid charge , and the frequency of the external fields .      to study the effect of the salt concentration and the colloid charge , we will focus on the case of static electric fields . for static fields , the motion of the colloid and its surrounding microions can be characterized by a scalar mobility @xmath71 , which represents the ratio between the velocity of the particle and the magnitude of the applied field . for the microions ,",
    "the mobility also depends on their position with respect to the colloid . in the simulation , we average over the velocities of microions which have a distance @xmath72 from the colloid center .    in fig .  [",

    "the number of counterions to neutralize the colloid charge is comparable to the number of salt at the lowest salt concentration , but is negligible at intermediate and high salt concentrations . for the parameter range considered here",
    "( @xmath74 ) , the electrophoretic mobility of the colloid depends only weakly on the salt concentration . when the salt concentration increases , the debye length becomes shorter , and the electrostatic interaction becomes more screened .",
    "this reduces the effective charge of the colloid , which includes the bare colloid charge and the contribution from condensed counterions , resulting in a slight reduction of the electrophoretic mobility of the colloid .     from the colloid center .",

    "the mobilities for counterions at different distances @xmath72 away from the colloid center are plotted in solid curves . due to the strong electrostatic attraction towards the colloid ,",
    "counterions overcome the entropic repulsion and accumulate in the vicinity of the colloidal surface .",
    "their mobility is a result of the interplay between two conflicting interactions . on the one hand , counterions have the opposite charge as the colloid , thus the external electric field drives counterions away from the colloid .",
    "similarly , the entropic force also tends to separate counterions and the colloid and pushes counterions towards regions where the ionic concentration is lower . on the other hand ,",
    "the coulomb attraction from the colloid charge and the hydrodynamic interaction from the colloid surface drag counterions along with the colloid .",
    "the mobility of the counterion is a result from these two competing effects . at low salt concentration , counterions close to the colloid experience strong attraction from the colloid , and they can be considered as attached to the colloid surface .",
    "therefore , the counterion mobility has the same sign as that of the colloid .",
    "note that both the hydrodynamic and the coulomb interaction depend on the distance between the counterion and the colloid .",
    "when the distance is increased , both interactions become weaker , resulting in a reduction of the counterion mobility .",
    "the counterion mobility also depends on the salt concentration . when the salt concentration increases , the debye length decreases and the electrostatic interaction becomes screened , resulting in a reduction of the attractive force from the colloid . in fig .",

    "the external field is strong enough to overcome the attraction , and drives even the closest counterions to move in the opposite direction of the colloid .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been discussed in ref .",

    "the electrostatic and hydrodynamic interactions are fully screened , and the forces exerted by the colloid on the microions are negligible . in this case , the mobilities for counterions and coions are both proportional to the diffusion constant of the microion @xmath30 , but with the opposite sign .",
    "the mobility for microions in solution without the colloid is shown as the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : salt_dc ] .",
    "the decrease of the mobility value at high salt concentration is the result of the reduction in the diffusion constant of the microion .",
    "the response of the colloid and microions can also be tuned by varying the bare charge on the colloid .",
    "compared to the previous situation of adjusting the salt concentration , where the range of the electrostatic interaction ( the debye screen length ) is varied , the change of the colloid charge directly alters the strength of the electrostatic interaction with the microions .",

    ", their motion is strongly influenced by the motion of the colloid .",
    "we shall examine the mobility of counterions at distances @xmath76 , starting from low to high frequencies . at low frequency ,",
    "one important contribution comes from the enhanced salt concentration building up near the colloid surface .",
    "the situation is depicted for a positively charged colloid in fig .",
    "[ fig : salt ] . at the back side of the colloid , a wake of negative counterions builds up which are dragged away from the surface by the external field .",
    "these counterions , combined with the coions coming in from the bulk solution , create an increase of the salt concentration on the left - hand side of the colloid  a salt source .",
    "a similar process occurs on the right - hand side of the colloid , where depletion of the counterions and coions results in a reduction of the salt concentration  a salt sink .",

    "the variation of the external field is too fast for the concentration gradient to build up , and the motion of the counterions is mainly driven by the external field .",

    "an input for the theory is the zeta potential , defined as the electric potential at the shear plane , an imaginary plane separating the hydrodynamically mobile and immobile fluid .",
    "the exact position of the shear plane is difficult to determine , and it is also possible that there is no sharp boundary at all .",
    "since the interacting sites of the colloid are set at @xmath45 , and in our model , they are responsible for the hydrodynamical coupling to the fluid , it is reasonable to use @xmath45 for the position of the shear plane .",

    "the resulting curves are shown in figure [ fig:7t2_alpha ] with solid lines .",
    "the result of the mwo theory is only in qualitative agreement with the simulation .",
    "the theory captures the main qualitative features , and roughly the correct crossover frequency , but it misses most of the details around the transition frequency .",
    "the simulation results feature a slight undershoot at the high frequency region .",
    "this can be explained by considering the inertia effect of the microions , which are not entirely negligible in our simulations .",
    "( in real systems , they are negligible . )",
    "the inertia effect can be incorporated into the theory by a frequency - dependent conductivity ( see appendix [ app : emwo ] ) and the theory can be revised accordingly , giving the dash - dotted lines in figure [ fig:7t2_alpha ] . it predicts small undershoots in both the real and the imaginary part of the polarizability , which are consistent with the simulation .",

    "however , due to the presence of the colloid , the microion motion is greatly modified , especially for counterions close to the colloid surface .",
    "the hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions with the colloid are then strong enough to force them to move together with the colloid",
    ". the range of the interaction from the colloid can be tuned by varying the salt concentration or the colloid charges . in general , the range is short for high ionic strength or weakly charged colloids .",
    "when an alternating electric field is applied , the dynamic response of the colloid and micrions depends on the frequency .",
    "the frequency - dependence of the microion mobility is controlled by two different processes .",
    "on the one hand , the oscillating field drives the microions directly . at low frequency , the movement of the microion is in phase with the perturbation . at high frequency ,",
    "the inertia effect prevents the microion from following the external field . the frequency that separates these two different region",
    "is related to the time scale @xmath128 . on the other hand",
    ", a concentration gradient can build up around the colloid surface at low frequency , which drives a diffusive motion of the microions from the region of high concentration to that of low concentration . the time required for the gradient to develop",
    "is @xmath129 .",
    "the motion of the microion is determined by the interplay between the field - induced and concentration - induced effects . for microions away from the colloid surface , the interaction to the colloid is weak , and the field - induced effect dominates . for microions close to the surface , the microions follow the colloid s motion at low frequency , but recover to the free - ion case at high frequency .",
    "the dielectric response of the charged colloid is characterized by the polarizability . for our colloid model",
    "( @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) , the main contribution to the dipole moment comes from the electric double layer . for microions ,",
    "there are two important length scales : one is the debye screening length @xmath130 , and the other one is the diameter of the colloid @xmath131 . associated with these two length scales , are the two time scales @xmath117 and @xmath129 , which correspond to the time required for the microion to diffuse over the distance @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively . for the parameters considered in this work , @xmath132 , thus the frequency @xmath133 is larger than @xmath96",
