    "despite enormous amount of work performed over more than thirty years , particularly in lattice simulations of qcd , full understanding of the qcd vacuum structure and color confinement mechanism are still lacking . indeed , direct derivation of confinement from first principles remain still elusive and there is no totally convincing proposal about its generating mechanism .",
    "however , on the other hand , we known that the vacuum topological structure of theories with dilaton fields is drastically changed compared to the non dilatonic ones @xcite . therefore much about confinement might be learned from such theories , particularly string inspired ones .",
    "the presence of fundamental scalars with direct coupling to gauge curvature terms in string theories offers a challenge with attractive implications in four - dimensional gauge theories . besides , since color confinement can be signaled through the behavior of the interaction potential at large distances . in this context , it was suggested in @xcite that an effective coupling of a massive dilaton to the 4-dimensional gauge fields may provide an interesting mechanism which accommodates both the coulomb and confining phases .",
    "the derivation performed in @xcite suggest a new scenario to generate color confinement . this scenario may be considered as a challenge to the mechanism based on monopole condensation .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the part i",
    ", we describe the influence of the dilaton on a low energy gauge theory and look into the problem how dilatonic degrees of freedom modifies coulomb potential and how transition to a confining phase occurs .",
    "then , we review several recent work by presenting the corresponding effective coupling functions used .",
    "we briefly comment on the analytic solutions of the field equations and their confinement features .",
    "part ii is devoted to phenomenological investigations .",
    "we study dick interquark potential in the heavy quarkonium systems using slet technique . and summarize the results obtained from this analysis .",
    "finally , we draw our general conclusion .",
    "the imprint of dilaton on a 4d effective nonabelian gauge theory is described by a lagrangian density :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the dilaton field and @xmath2 is the standard field strength tensor of the theory .",
    "@xmath3 denotes the non perturbative dilaton potential and @xmath4 represents the coupling function depending on @xmath1 .",
    "several forms of @xmath4 have been proposed in literature .",
    "the most popular one @xmath5 occurred in string theory and kaluza - klein theories @xcite .",
    "analysis of the problem of coulomb gauge theory augmented with dilaton degrees of freedom in ( 1 ) performed as follows : + first , we consider a point like static coulomb source defined in the rest frame by the current :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the expectation value of @xmath8 generator .",
    "the field equations emerging from the static configuration ( 2 ) are given by :    @xmath9 = j^\\nu\\ ] ]    and    @xmath10    by setting @xmath11 , and after some algebra , we derive the chromo - electric field :    @xmath12    where the effective charge is @xmath13 .",
    "+ eq(5 ) shows that it is the running of the effective charge that makes the potential stronger than the coulomb potential . in other words ,",
    "the coulomb spectrum is recovered if the effective charge did not run .",
    "thereby the interquark potential reads as @xcite ,    @xmath14    with @xmath15 and @xmath16    the formula in eq .",
    "( 6 ) is remarkable since it provides a direct relation between the interquark potential and the coupling function @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , it shows that existence of confining phases in this effectivee theory is subject to the following condition ,    @xmath18    at this stage , the main objective is to solve the field equations of motion ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) and determine analytically @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "for this , @xmath4 and @xmath3 have to be fixed . in the sequel",
    "the dilaton potential is set to @xmath21 .",
    "below , we will briefly describe the main features of three recent models and present their solutions .      in this effective theory ,",
    "dick used the form : @xmath22 where f represents a coupling scale characterizing the strength of the scalar - gluon coupling and @xmath23 is a parameter in the range",
    "@xmath24 $ ] .",
    "he derived the radial dependence of the dilaton field and the interquark potential ( up to a color factor ) @xcite : @xmath25    @xmath26\\ ] ]    with the abbreviation : @xmath27 + remarkably the potential @xmath28 comes with the required behavior : a first term which accommodates the coulomb interaction at short distances and a second term linearly increasing in the asymptotic regime with a string tension , solutions of the field equations reduced to : @xmath29 , @xmath30 + @xmath31 which depends on the dilatonic degrees of freedom @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "+      in this model , the glueballs are represented by a massive scalar field @xmath1 and couple in a non minimal way to gluons , through @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "cornwall - soni were the first to motivate such term as a low enrgy correction to effective models of qcd + analytical solutions were found for @xmath35@xcite ,    @xmath36^{\\frac{1}{3 } } \\ ,    r^{-\\frac{4}{3}}\\ ] ] @xmath37^\\frac{1}{3}r^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\ ] ]    these formulas show that at large distances , confinement is probed through an interaction potential proportional to @xmath38 and considered by the authors as non perturbative correction to the coulomb phase .      the main aim in this work was to construct a low energy effective field theory from which some popular phenomenological potentials may emerge .",
    "to this end , we proposed the coupling function @xmath39 @xcite . + by substituting @xmath4 eq .",
    "( 3 , 4 ) , the field equations were found too complicated to integrate analytically .",
    "fortunatly , since the focus is on the long range behavior of the dilaton field and on how it modifies the coulom phase , the analysis is restricted to the infrared region .",
    "thus , the asymptotic solutions are found to be ,    @xmath40\\ ] ] and the chromo - electric potential : @xmath41    we see that the occurrence of confinement depends on the parametre @xmath42 and our effective theory can serve to model quark confinement when @xmath43 $ ] .    on the other hand , going back to the objective of this study : by selecting specific values of @xmath42 , we reproduced the following known interquark potentials    * @xmath44 @xmath45 linear term of cornwall potential @xcite .",
    "* @xmath46 @xmath45 martin s potential @xcite . *",
    "@xmath47 @xmath45 song - lin , or motyka - zalewski potential @xcite .",
    "* @xmath48 @xmath45 turin potential @xcite .",
    "therefore , these quark potentials , which gained credibility only through confrontation to the hadron spectrum , are now supplied with a theoretical framework since they can be derived from a low energy effective theory .",
    "our aim in this part of the review paper is to dedicate more efforts to understand the new confinement mechanism suggested above through phenomenological investigation of dick potential in the heavy meson sector .",
    "this study will be addressed as in @xcite where the shifted-@xmath49 expansion technique is used ( slet ) where @xmath49 is the angular momentum .",
    "this method provides a powerful analytic technique for determining the bound states of the semi - relativistic wave equation consisting of two quarks of masses @xmath50 , @xmath51 and total binding meson energy @xmath52 in any spherically symmetric potential .",
    "it is rapidly converging and handles highly excited states which pose problems for variational methods @xcite .",
    "moreover , relativistic corrections are included in a consistent way .",

    ", we set the charm and bottom quark masses to the values @xmath57  gev and @xmath58  gev .",
    "for the qcd coupling constant , in contrast to the lattice potentials which use the same effective coupling in the description of heavy quarkonium , we take into account the running of @xmath56 , @xmath59ln(m_z/\\lambda)},\\ ] ] where the renormalization scale is fixed to @xmath60 , with @xmath61 is the reduced mass , @xmath62    thus , combination of the leading order formula ( 9 ) and the world experimental value @xmath63 yields , @xmath64 while @xmath65 for the @xmath66 quarkonia . on the other hand ,",
    "the interquark potential parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 are treated as being free in our analysis and are obtained by fitting the spin - averaged @xmath67 and @xmath68 bound states .",
    "an excellent fit with the available experimental data can be seen to emerge when the following values are assigned , is used , the dilaton mass will be shifted to a value about @xmath69 . ]",
    "@xmath70    tables ( 1,2 ) list the results of the analysis for the spin - averaged energy levels of interest . in all cases , where comparison with experiment is possible",
    ", agreement is generally very good .",
    "next step , to check the consistency of our predictions , we estimate the bound states energies of the @xmath66 quarkonia .",
    "these states are expected to be produced at lhc and tevatron .",
    "moreover , they should provide an excellent test to discriminate between various techniques used to probe nonperturbative properties of hadrons . in table 3",
    "we show our calculated spectrum .",
    "the estimate of the mass of the lowest pseudoscalar s - state of the @xmath71 spectra is close to the experimental value reported by cdf and d0 collaborations @xcite . as to the higher states masses , they compare favorably with other predictions based on qcd sum - rules @xcite or potential models @xcite-@xcite . in conclusion ,",
    "dick interquark potential ( 08 ) is tested successfully to fit the spin - averaged quarkonium spectrun . in view of these results , it is quite encouraging to pursue phenomenological application of @xmath72 and other quark potentials emerging from such low effective gauge theory with dilaton .",
    "we revisited some of the most recent work on confinement in 4d non abelian gauge theories with a massive scalar field ( dilaton ) and effective coupling functions to gauge fields .",
    "analytical solutions have been found with confinement feature at large distances .",
    "thus , these low energy effective theories can serve well to model quark confinement . moreover , by using dick interquark potential in the heavy quarkonium sector",
    ", we showed that phenomenological investigation of the confinement generating mechanism suggested by these models is more than justified .",
    "indeed , the obtained results for charmoniun and bottomonium fit well experimental data when the dilaton mass is given a value about 57 mev .",
    "also , for @xmath71 system , we found that the s - state energy level is close to the value reported by cdf collaboration , while those of excited states agree favorably with predictions of other theoretical studies . on the other hand , as a by - product",
    ", this analysis allows a test to the physics beyond the standard model in relation to hadron spectroscopy .",
    "indeed , the estimate of the dilaton mass lies in the range of values proposed in @xcite . which may shed some light on the search of the dilaton since the possibility to identify this hypothetical particle to a fundamental scalar invisible to present day experiments should not be ruled out @xcite .",
