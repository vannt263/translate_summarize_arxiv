    "another key difference is the lowering of the star formation rate ( sfr ) in the cond run ( fig .",

    "the infall phase of the merger lasts for about @xmath25  gyrs , and the final coalescence of the central galaxies of the merging clusters takes place at about @xmath26 .",
    "this merger enhances the sfrs in both runs , but the amount of merger - induced star formation ( sf ) is drastically different in the two runs .",
    "the cond run shows only a modest post - merger sfr of @xmath27 , while the nocond run has sfrs that are as high as @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , sf in the cond run is completely quenched @xmath29 gyrs before the nocond run .",
    "we note that although the late time sfrs are very different in the two runs , the reduction in the total stellar mass in the cond run is only about @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , the stellar metallicities and the stellar ages of the central galaxy of the cluster are very similar in both runs .",
    "this is because most of the stellar mass has been built up before @xmath31 , where the sfrs are generally comparable since thermal conduction is not very effective at these times .    the discrepancy in the sfrs is also reflected in the intrinsic colors of the central galaxy ( dashed curves and insets in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] ) , especially in the post merger phase of the cluster evolution .",
    "the @xmath32 color of the central galaxy in the cond run is as high as @xmath33 , which places the galaxy in the red cloud , whereas the high sfrs in the nocond run reduces the @xmath34 color to @xmath35 for about @xmath25 gyrs after the merger .",

    "[ fig : gmet ] shows the gas metallicity profiles of the simulated clusters in the nocond ( blue curve ) and cond ( red curve ) runs at @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding shaded regions denote the @xmath37 deviation from the mean metallicity . while the gas phase metallicities in the outer parts of the cluster are quite similar in both runs , the difference between them ( in both the mean value and dispersion ) within the core of the cluster ( @xmath38 ) is quite striking .",
    "the cond run reproduces observational estimates ( @xcite ; gold shaded region @xmath39 @xcite ; solid black curve ) of the metallicity profiles in clusters more faithfully .",
    "the lower sfrs at @xmath40 in the cond run can in principle explain the low metallicity values in the center .",
    "however , this does not explain the lower dispersion of metallicities at a fixed radius . in order to understand this behavior , we plot mass - weighted gas metallicity maps and the corresponding profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gmet ] ) for both the nocond and cond runs .",
    "we chose @xmath4 as our starting redshift because both runs have at that point a quenched galaxy in the center , and they have entered a relatively quiescent phase of evolution .",
    "there is no metal enrichment due to star formation and the only outflow mechanism is agn driven winds . at @xmath4 , both the runs start out with a central metallicity core .",
    "the core in the nocond run has a higher metallicity and is more concentrated because of the larger star formation rates at late times .",
    "however , by @xmath36 , the core in the cond run is completely mixed , making the metallicity profile extremely flat and lowering its dispersion , while the core in the nocond run still exists .",
    "these results point to the fact that conduction leads to significantly increased metal mixing , driven by turbulence injected by the central agn .",
    "we conclude that the inclusion of anisotropic thermal conduction has a strong effect on the properties of the icm ( i.e. , temperature , entropy , density , metallicity profiles ) and on the characteristics of the central galaxy ( star formation rates , colors etc . ) .",
    "there are three possible mechanisms through which conduction can cause these changes .",
    "( 1 ) thermal conduction might force the agn to inject more energy into the cluster core by conducting heat outwards , ( 2 ) conductive heating during the cc phase might offset cooling loses , or ( 3 ) thermal conduction might couple the injected agn energy more efficiently with the icm .",
    "[ fig : bhenergy ] shows that the amount of energy deposited by the central agn in the cond run ( solid red curve ) is consistently lower than in the nocond run ( solid blue curve ) by about @xmath41 .",
    "this rules out the first mechanism .",
    "conductive heating in the cc phase of cluster evolution can in principle offset the cooling losses in the core , thereby reducing sf .",
    "however , this does not explain the suppression of sf when the cond run shows a ncc structure .",
    "more importantly , throughout the cc phase of cluster evolution the conduction luminosity ( @xmath42 ) in the cond run is an order of magnitude lower than both the injected agn luminosity and the total cooling luminosity within the cluster core .",
    "consequently , we can safely conclude that conductive heating can not be the full explanation for the observed differences between the two runs .",
    "it can provide at best a part of the energy needed in the cc phase .",
    "kpc ) of @xmath43 ( dotted curves ) and @xmath44 ( dashed curve ) is also plotted as a function of time .",
    "the blue curves denote the values obtained from the nocond run , while the red curves show the values for the cond run.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    thus , a more efficient coupling of the injected agn feedback energy with the surrounding icm , mediated by conduction , seems to be the most plausible explanation .",
    "the agn feedback model used in our simulations distinguishes between a high accretion rate quasar - mode feedback channel , modeled through local thermal energy injection , and a low accretion rate kinetic feedback mode , imparting momentum into the surrounding gas  @xcite .",
    "the direction of the momentum injection is stochastic such that on average it is isotropic",
    ". the quasar mode feedback dominates at high redshifts , while the kinetic feedback mechanism becomes important below @xmath45 .",
    "the metallicity evolution between @xmath4 and @xmath46 clearly demonstrates that there is more efficient turbulent mixing of the thermal plasma ( and consequently metals ) within the cluster core which can in principle explain the increased coupling efficiency between the agn feedback energy and the icm .",
    "however , the average ( between @xmath4 and @xmath46 ) one - dimensional velocity dispersion profiles of the icm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] ) in the nocond ( blue curve ) run ( @xmath47 ) is higher than in the cond ( red curve ) run ( @xmath48 ) , especially in the cluster core .",
    "this seems to suggest that there is more metal / plasma mixing in - spite of lower turbulent velocities in the cond run .     and",
    "@xmath36 ) one - dimensional velocity dispersion profiles in the nocond ( blue curve ) and cond ( red curve ) runs.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the ability of external turbulence to efficiently mix a stratified plasma depends on its convective stability , which , for a pure hydrodynamic plasma , is decided by its entropy gradient .",
    "specifically , the plasma is stable as long as @xmath49 ( schwarzschild criterion , * ? ? ?",
    "this is generally true for all observed clusters ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hence the icm is conventionally thought to be convectively stable . in the presence of external turbulence , a fluid element in a stably stratified atmosphere which is adiabatically displaced from its equilibrium position by a small amount @xmath50 will experience a buoyant restoring force @xmath51 @xcite , causing oscillations around its equilibrium position at the classical brunt - visl frequency .",
    "if the turbulent driving force ( @xmath52 ) is larger than the buoyant restoring force ( @xmath43 ) then it can induce mixing .",
    "this picture changes in the presence of anisotropic thermal conduction because it fundamentally changes the response of the plasma to perturbations .",
    "provided @xmath53 , conduction along magnetic field lines causes the icm to be ( formally ) buoyantly unstable regardless of the temperature and entropy gradients . when @xmath54 ( for ccs in the central cooling region ) the icm is unstable to the heat - flux - driven buoyancy instability  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hbi ) , and when @xmath55 ( for all clusters on large scales ) it is unstable to the magneto - thermal instability  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mti ) . as a consequence",
    ", any amount of external turbulence will instantly mix the already convectively unstable ( i.e. , zero restoring force ) thermal plasma without an energy penalty @xcite . even in the saturated state of these instabilities",
    "the buoyant restoring force is proportional to the temperature gradient ( @xmath56 ) instead of the entropy gradient @xcite .",
    "our blackhole feedback model is characterized by self - regulation , i.e.  it keeps injecting energy until the cooling losses are accounted for .",
    "this implies that the agn will essentially supply higher and higher turbulent energy until the injected turbulent driving force is larger than the buoyant restoring force , at which point it will induce mixing , isotropizing the injected energy and stopping cooling in the cluster core .",
    "the higher the buoyant restoring force , the larger the amount of turbulence injected by the agn in order to induce mixing .    fig .",
    "[ fig : bhenergy ] shows that the restoring forces in the nocond and cond runs , calculated using the entropy gradient ( @xmath43 , blue and red dotted curves , respectively ) , are quite similar .",
    "when we account for the fact that the buoyant response of an anisotropically conducting plasma is fundamentally different from that of a pure hydrodynamic fluid and calculate the restoring force using the temperature gradient ( @xmath44 , red dashed line ) , we find lower restoring forces in the cond run , which essentially explains the lower turbulent velocities and increased rate of plasma mixing in this run .",
    "we note that @xmath44 is in principle only valid in the saturated state of the instabilities , otherwise the restoring forces are essentially zero .",
    "hence , @xmath44 represents an upper limit to the restoring force in an anisotropically conducting plasma .",
    "it is very difficult to assess the state of these instabilities in fully cosmological simulations .",
    "we can however get some insights by noting that the timescale between successive agn bursts , @xmath57 , is much smaller than the growth timescales for these instabilities , which is of the order of @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the hbi and mti instabilities are unlikely to saturate or even grow considerably between successive agn injection events . besides , fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] clearly shows that it is not the additional turbulence generated by these instabilities that causes the plasma to mix , rather , they change the buoyant response of the icm and make it more prone to mixing .",
    "it is the injection of turbulence into this modified state that causes the efficient mixing of the plasma .",
    "therefore , the agn kinetic wind power needed to induce gas mixing in the core is reduced .",
    "this allows the more efficient utilization of the injected energy in the cond run , thereby drastically improving the coupling between the injected feedback energy and the icm .",
    "the enhanced mixing of gas of different entropies will also contribute to a flattening of the entropy profiles in cool core phases of evolution .",
    "moreover , the increased mixing in the cond run randomizes the magnetic field orientation , which in turn isotropizes the direction of conductive heat flow .",
    "this is particularly effective in redistributing the energy in the quasar mode of the agn feedback , and in the high temperature regions @xcite formed when the agn kinetic winds shock against the icm .",
    "therefore , it seems that conduction enables turbulence , and turbulence enables conduction @xcite .",
    "although we have shown that there is more mixing in the cond run , we have not rigorously quantified this mechanism .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the current study and is left for future work .",
    "we have presented cosmological mhd simulations of the formation of a galaxy cluster , comparing calculations with and without anisotropic thermal conduction .",
    "these are the first simulations to self - consistently include and quantify the effect of thermal conduction on both the integrated and small - scale properties of galaxy clusters .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    * thermal conduction causes an earlier disruption of the cool core , and a subsequent reduction of the star formation rates by more than an order of magnitude at low redshift . the central gas phase metallicity gradients and dispersions",
    "are also reduced , despite an overall lower amount of agn feedback energy injected into the icm . * the coupling between the agn feedback energy and the icm is effectively enhanced in the presence of anisotropic thermal conduction .",
    "it is considerably easier to mix thermal plasma in the presence of conduction , because the plasma is unstable irrespective of the temperature or entropy gradient and thus already prone to mixing .",
    "the restoring buoyancy forces are reduced , leading to efficient mixing even with low levels of external turbulent driving .",
    "this helps to isotropize the injected agn feedback energy , thereby quenching the clusters more efficiently .",
    "we have also simulated two other , less massive clusters ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) at lower resolution .",
    "the general trends ( earlier termination of the cool core , lower sfrs , and lower central metallicities and dispersion etc . ) are very similar for these clusters , suggesting that our conclusions robustly apply to other systems as well .",
    "we stress that although thermal conduction helps in quenching star formation , it is not sufficient on its own for stabilizing clusters or converting a cool core to a non cool core ( at least not for these cluster masses ) .",
    "it only amplifies the effect of external turbulent driving .",
    "the external source of turbulence can in principle take many forms , such as mergers , cosmic ray driven convection , etc . , and is not limited to the kinetic agn winds examined here .",
    "we thus expect that the importance of anisotropic thermal conduction carries over to other forms of feedback as well .",
