    "the photon polarization tensor is a central object in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "it contains essential information about the renormalization properties of qed and , accounting for the vacuum fluctuations of the underlying theory , it encodes quantum corrections to coulomb s force law . in the presence of an external field , the photon polarization tensor acquires a dependence on the external field , which couples to the quantum fluctuations involving charged particles .",
    "correspondingly , it gives rise to a variety of dispersive ( associated with its real part ) and absorptive ( associated with its imaginary part ) effects affecting photon propagation in electromagnetic fields . on a more formal level , the finite external field results in a substantially richer tensor structure as compared to the zero field limit , where the ward identity immediately constrains the polarization tensor in momentum space to factorize into an overall tensor structure and a single scalar function .",
    "as long as the external field is homogeneous , translational invariance implies that the polarization tensor in momentum space depends only on the transferred four - momentum and the respective field vectors . in the case of a pure magnetic or electric field , the photon polarization tensor in momentum space",
    "can then be decomposed into three independent tensor structures , that can be associated with three distinct polarization modes , and the corresponding scalar functions .",
    "thus , the vacuum subject to an external field exhibits medium - like properties .",
    "the difference in the momentum dependence of these modes gives rise to striking observable consequences , such as vacuum birefringence and dichroism @xcite .",
    "even for pure and homogeneous fields , the associated scalar functions at one - loop accuracy are highly non - trivial .",
    "they are most conveniently stated in terms of double parameter integrals @xcite that can not be tackled analytically in any straightforward way .",
    "one of the integrals is over propertime , and the other one over an additional parameter governing the momentum dependence in the loop . in case of a pure magnetic field",
    "@xmath0 @xcite , the entire field dependence of the scalar functions is via trigonometric functions , whose arguments depend multiplicatively on the field amplitude @xmath1 . analogously , for a pure electric field @xmath2 , the dependence is via a factor @xmath3 in the arguments of the corresponding hyperbolic functions .    as already discussed on the the level of the heisenberg - euler lagrangian @xcite ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , both situations are related by an electric - magnetic duality .",
    "whereas the effective action in a pure homogeneous field depends only on the electric charge , the electron mass and the external fieldthe effective action is a scalar quantity , and the external field is the only vector in the problem .",
    "hence , the dependence can be via the field amplitude only .",
    "] , the photon polarization tensor in addition features an explicit dependence on the transferred four - momentum .",
    "thus , besides a mapping of the field , the corresponding duality for the photon polarization tensor involves a transformation of the components parallel and perpendicular to the external field also @xcite .",
    "while the generic analytic properties of the photon polarization tensor in a magnetic field and its different representations : propertime , dispersion - sum , and landau or spectral sum representation , respectively , have been studied in great detail by @xcite , and very recently again by @xcite , handy analytical expressions and controlled approximations that hold within certain , well - constrained parameter regimes are still very rare  even more so beyond on - the - light - cone dynamics . for a recent numerical study , cf .",
    "results for the photon polarization tensor in other external field configurations like constant crossed fields and plane wave backgrounds are also available @xcite ( for the crossed field case , cf . also @xcite ) . for recent reviews about strong field qed in the context of high intensity laser experiments , see @xcite .    triggered by the seminal works of tsai and erber @xcite in the 1970s ,",
    "ongoing efforts have sought to find adequate approximations for the photon polarization tensor in the presence of an external magnetic or electric field ( e.g. , @xcite ) in various limits .",
    "however , their derivation in general involves constraints to a certain momentum regime and most of these approximations are tailored to on - the - light - cone dynamics . while there are some motivations and indications concerning their regimes of applicability , so far more systematic studies of their regimes of validity  particularly beyond on - the - light - cone dynamics  have not been performed . in this paper",
    "we aim at going beyond .",
    "our focus is threefold : to thoroughly investigate the regimes of validity of established approximations , to generalize them beyond on - the - light - cone dynamics , and to obtain new analytical results , particularly into the nonperturbative regime .",
    "correspondingly , our paper can be considered as constituting a viable toolbox , providing approximations to the photon polarization tensor in various well - specified physical parameter regimes . for clarity and easy reference",
    "we summarize the physical parameter regimes studied in this work in table  [ tab : parameterregs ] .    1.2    .in this table we list the physical parameter regimes studied in this work for on - the - light - cone dynamics , @xmath4 .",
    "all regimes are studied for both magnetic , @xmath5 , and electric , @xmath6 , fields .",
    "we introduce a descriptive label for each regime ( written in italics ) , and reference the corresponding section in this work .",
    "moreover , we indicate where this work adds major contributions .",
    "obviously , for @xmath4 each regime can be characterized by just two different inequalities .",
    "this is no longer the case for @xmath7 , where additional constrains are needed .",
    "we will nevertheless use the same labels for the analogous regimes generalized to @xmath7 also .",
    "let us emphasize that the two inequalities chosen to characterize a particular regime are not unique .",

    "whereas it is known exactly for arbitrary homogeneous , externally set electromagnetic field configurations in terms of a double parameter integral @xcite , we here limit ourselves to the special case of a pure , i.e. , either magnetic or electric , and homogeneous field . by this choice",
    "we explicitly restrict ourselves to a certain class of reference systems and break lorentz covariance : as @xmath8 and @xmath9 are of course not invariant under general lorentz transformations , only then our notion of discerning @xmath8 and @xmath9 as _ pure _ fields makes sense .",

    "<S> we revisit the photon polarization tensor in a homogeneous external magnetic or electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point of our considerations is the momentum space representation of the one - loop photon polarization tensor in the presence of a homogeneous electromagnetic field , known in terms of a double parameter integral . </S>",
    "<S> our focus is on explicit analytical insights for both on- and off - the - light - cone dynamics in a wide range of well - specified physical parameter regimes , ranging from the perturbative to the manifestly nonperturbative strong field regime . </S>",
    "<S> the basic ideas underlying well - established approximations to the photon polarization tensor are carefully examined and critically reviewed . in particular , we systematically keep track of all contributions , both the ones to be neglected and those to be taken into account explicitly , to all orders . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to study their ranges of applicability in a much more systematic and rigorous way . </S>",
    "<S> we point out the limitations of such approximations and manage to go beyond at several instances . </S>"
