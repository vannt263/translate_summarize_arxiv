    "the point at 8.46 ghz at the second epoch is the average of the three measurements of taylor et al .",
    "we made a rough calibration of the march 29.9 @xmath33 band data ( klose et al . , 1998 ) by a power - law extrapolation of the @xmath0 and @xmath32 band data , inferred from the march 29.99 ntt images , of a nearby object that appears to be equally bright as the transient in the @xmath33 band image . from this",
    "we infer that , if the nearby object remained constant , the grb should have @xmath52 on march 29.9 .",
    "we have scaled this value to march 29.99 , according to a power - law of index 1.3 and assigned a conservative error bar of @xmath53 magnitudes , to account for the uncertainties in spectral slope , temporal extrapolation and eye estimate of the relative @xmath33 band fluxes of the two objects in klose et al.s images . for the second epoch",
    ", we used the magnitude of the host galaxy , @xmath54 , as an upper limit on the level of the transient .",
    "in fact , all optical and near - infrared magnitudes of the point - like source might be overestimated , due to the underlying host galaxy , the brightness of which is not precisely determined in any band .",
    "the x - ray flux at 4 kev on march 29.99 has been computed using a temporal power - law of index @xmath55 and a spectral index @xmath56 ( in t zand et al .",
    "1998 ; @xmath57 ) . a temporal decay with @xmath58 ( greiner et al . 1998 ) has been assumed to compute the upper limit on april 6.2 .",
    "the @xmath33 band detection of klose et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , roughly calibrated by us ( @xmath59 ) , and our @xmath0 band measurement on march 29.99 ( see table 1 ) yield a color @xmath60 , equivalent to a spectral index of @xmath61 , which suggests a red spectrum for the transient . similarly , from our @xmath0 and @xmath40 band quasi - simultaneous measurements we derive an upper limit of @xmath62 , consistent with a red spectrum ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the measurements in april 2 ( table 1 ) give @xmath64 , corresponding to @xmath65 .",
    "these spectral slopes are much steeper than found for grb970508 , for which spectroscopy ( metzger et al . 1997 ) and multi - band photometry ( see caption to fig",
    ". 2 for references ) give an optical index of @xmath66 and an optical - to - near - infrared index of @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , the blast wave models of grb afterglows predict flatter indices in these bands ( @xmath68 , see sari et al .",
    "1998 , wijers & galama 1998 ) . since",
    "the dust column density in the direction of grb980329 is moderate , reddening could be due either to intrinsic or intergalactic extinction .",
    "the former would imply the presence of a dust and gas rich medium and likely intense star formation , while the latter would suggest a rather high redshift .",
    "the remarkable intensity of the burst does not point to a very large distance ( see also in t zand et al .",
    "1998 ) , therefore we have considered the possibility that grb980329 occurred in a starburst galaxy , and we have investigated how the typical obscuration of this class of galaxies would affect the intrinsic spectrum of grb980329 at a range of redshifts up to @xmath69 . to this aim",
    ", we corrected the sed of grb980329 for the redshifted extinction curve of 19 local starburst galaxies ( calzetti 1997 ) . since the curve has been derived by considering only the starburst regions , excluding the old stellar populations of the sample galaxies , we expect it to be appropriate also for starburst galaxies at moderate or high redshift ( calzetti 1998 ) .",
    "we have noted that for @xmath70 the corrected @xmath0 and @xmath33 band flux ranges of march 29.99 are consistent with the extrapolation to optical frequencies of the power - law which best fits the x - ray spectrum , and that the corrected @xmath0 band upper limit and @xmath42 band flux of april 6.2 imply a spectral index @xmath71 , consistent with theoretical expectation ( see fig .",
    "this redshift value is in agreement with the observation of intense star formation at @xmath72 ( madau et al .",
    "1996 ) and thus broadly supports the proposal that grbs occur in actively star - forming galaxies ( paczyski 1998 ) .",
    "the visual extinction of the applied model ( @xmath73 ) would correspond to @xmath74 @xmath8 in our galaxy ( and therefore to a probably not higher value in a starburst ) , well within the range of @xmath75 derived from the power - law fit to the x - ray data ( in t zand et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the multi - wavelength data of the two afterglows are too few and sparse to allow a detailed description of the spectral shapes in the various bands and precise localization of the energy peaks .",
    "however , the overall seds of the two bursts at the different epochs seem to be consistent with a single emission component , whose maximum shifts in time toward lower energies . for grb970508 ,",
    "the sed appears smooth and exhibits a broad peak which , at the first epoch , likely falls at or immediately above x - ray frequencies , while it is located between @xmath76 and @xmath77 hz on may 19 . in grb980329 ,",
    "the peak of the @xmath48@xmath49 curve on march 29.99 is at or around @xmath78 hz , as indicated by the x - ray spectral index , while on april 6.2 it is located between @xmath79 and @xmath76 hz and appears narrower .",
    "according to the sari et al .",
    "model , in which the emission is produced through synchrotron radiation from an expanding relativistic shell , it is possible to reproduce the observed temporal evolution of the multi - wavelength spectrum of grb970508 for a relativistic electron distribution @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "( notice that the representation of the synthetic spectrum in their fig .",
    "1 is in @xmath49 . ) on the other hand , the sed peak of grb980329 , which is much better constrained than that of grb970508 , exhibits a displacement by more than 4 decades in energy in @xmath510 days .",
    "this can not be accounted for by the sari et al .",
    "model , even assuming the fastest temporal evolution envisaged by their scenario ( fully radiative expansion in fast cooling regime , which holds anyway only within short times after the grb ) .",
    "the onset of a subrelativistic expansion some days after the grb would imply a faster change of the synchrotron break frequency of the electron distribution ( wijers et al .",
    "1997 ) and might better describe the observed behaviour .    the hypothesis of significant intrinsic obscuration at @xmath72 for grb980329 improves the modeling of its multi - wavelength data , although it does not account for its apparently more abrupt spectral evolution than observed for grb970508 . under this assumption , which by no means represents a stringent prediction on the redshift , we estimate that the total energy released by the grb in the observed 40 - 700 kev range would be approximately @xmath82 erg ( @xmath83 = 65 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath84 ) , consistent with models of grb formation from coalescence of neutron stars ."
