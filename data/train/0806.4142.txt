    "transiting extrasolar planets allow us to perform critical tests of models of planetary system formation and evolution . in our solar system , all of the planets orbit approximately , _ but not exactly _ , in the solar equatorial plane .",
    "@xcite find that the angle between the plane of the ecliptic and the solar equator is @xmath2 .",
    "the near co - planarity of the planetary orbits in our solar system has influenced models of planetary system origin from the time of @xcite and @xcite to essentially all modern models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the level of misalignment in our solar system , and the observation of warps in debris disks around nearby stars such as @xmath3  pic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is obvious that there are common processes which give rise to some small level of spin - orbit misalignment in planetary systems .",
    "the degree of misalignment in real planetary systems must depend on the initial conditions ( the initial asymmetries of the collapsing cloud ) , the physics of disk formation and evolution , and the physics of stellar mass and angular momentum loss during the t  tauri phase .",
    "most transiting planets have periods of just a few days and orbits of low eccentricity .",
    "significant exceptions are hd147506b ( hat - p-2b ) @xcite , with a 5.6 day orbital period and eccentricity of 0.52 , hd17156 @xcite , which has the longest orbital period ( 21 days ) and the largest eccentricity ( 0.67 ) of all of the transiting exoplanets , and xo-3b , a massive ( 13.25 @xmath4 ) planet which has an eccentricity of 0.26 in spite of it short orbital period of 3.192 days @xcite .",
    "scenarios for the formation of short - period planetary systems do not necessarily deliver those planets to their present semi - major axes with low eccentricity .",
    "type  ii migration can result in planets with moderate eccentricities @xcite , while dynamical interactions among newly formed planets and planetesimals @xcite or the kozai mechanism @xcite can result in large eccentricities and significant inclination of planetary orbital planes from the plane of the stellar equator ( which is presumably close to the plane of the inner portion of the proto - planetary disk ) .",
    "while the shortest period transiting systems have probably been tidally circularized , longer period systems can easily retain large eccentricities over the main - sequence lifetime of the parent star .",
    "a planet that has undergone significant gravitational scattering or kozai excitation would not necessarily retain a low inclination relative to the stellar equator .",
    "thus , the report of a possible spin - orbit misalignment of the hd17156b transiting planet by @xcite is extremely interesting , and calls for further detailed investigation . in this paper",
    ", we report our own spectroscopic observations of a transit of hd17156 by its planet , using two telescopes at mcdonald observatory .",
    "we observed the transit of hd17156 by its hot - jupiter companion on the night of 25  december 2007  ut , using both the 2.7 m harlan j. smith telescope ( hjst ) and the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) at mcdonald observatory .",

    ". this uncertainty does not include other intrinsic stellar sources of uncertainty , nor any unidentified sources of systematic errors .",
    "the two different spectrographs have independent arbitrary velocity zero points , and thus there is some constant offset velocity ( determined below and denoted as @xmath11 ) between the data sets presented in tables  [ tab : hjsvels ] and  [ tab : hetvels ] .",

    "@xcite divided a model stellar photosphere into a large number of cells , and then used a `` gaussian shape cross - correlation model '' with a linear limb darkening law to compute the radial velocity anomaly .",
    "@xcite developed analytic expressions for the apparent radial velocity perturbation during a transit , in several different approximations .",
    "@xcite developed another set of analytic expressions for the rm effect which utilize a more generalized higher order limb darkening expression .",
    "a more elaborate technique was developed by @xcite , who first computed an approximation to the disk - integrated stellar spectrum .",
    "they then computed a doppler shifted and intensity scaled spectrum of the portion of the disk that would be blocked by the transiting planet and subtracted this from their disk - integrated spectrum .",
    "this spectrum was then multiplied by their high - resolution iodine spectrum , and the result was processed through their radial velocity code to compute model velocities in the same manner as the observed data .",
    "we analyzed our data using a model that is a hybrid of these methods .",
    "we started by adopting the hd17156b system parameters from @xcite .",
    "we then computed the orbit of the planet around the star , as we would view it from earth .",
    "this gave us the apparent offset of the planet from the center of the star as a function of time through the transit .",
    "we divided the stellar disk into a @xmath12 grid of cells , in the manner of @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "for each photospheric cell , we computed a specific intensity using the non - linear four - parameter limb darkening law of @xcite .",
    "each photospheric cell is also assigned a radial velocity due to both the stellar orbital motion and the stellar rotation , with the stellar @xmath13 as a model parameter . for each time step during the transit , from first contact to fourth contact ,",
    "we compute which stellar photospheric cells are blocked by the transiting planet .",
    "we then integrate the unblocked doppler - shifted and intensity weighted stellar photospheric cells to compute both the rm radial velocity perturbation during the transit and the transit photometric lightcurve .",
    "we fully recognize the limitations and approximations inherent in this modeling procedure .",
    "first , there is no _ a priori _ reason to assume that limb - darkening should follow any particular law . also , the limb darkening in photospheric absorption lines is quite different from the limb darkening in the continuum .",
    "while this appears to be taken into account by @xcite , the limb darkening parameterization is based on model atmospheres rather than on real stars .",
    "more importantly , in our model we compute the specific - intensity weighted apparent doppler shift of the visible portion of the photosphere . on the other hand , our spectra record transit - perturbed stellar absorption line profile shapes from which we measure an apparent doppler shift using a computer code that assumes an unperturbed line - profile shape . in future improvements to our rm model , we will attempt to improve several of these limitations .",
    "we used the model described in sec .  [ sec : rmmodel ] to analyze simultaneously the data sets from the hjst cs23 , the het hrs , and the observations published by @xcite , which we will refer to as the `` oao / hides '' data set .",
    "since each data set has its own independent velocity zero - point , we allowed the systemic velocity of each data set to be an independent free parameter in the analysis .",
    "the values of the fixed parameters for the analysis are given in table  [ tab : fixedparams ] .",
    "the planetary orbital elements were taken from @xcite .",
    "these elements are essentially indistinguishable from the single - planet fit of @xcite .",

    "examining the @xmath39 of each individual data set in the full model and the @xmath41 model showed that even in the noisiest case of the oao / hides data , the rm effect reduced the total @xmath39 by 13.1 .    due to the symmetric signature of the rm effect in the @xmath46 case ,",
    "it is critically important to sample the entire transit . this is evidenced by the fit to the het / hrs data alone , in which despite the high quality of the data , only the first half of the transit was observable , and therefore erroneous parameters are derived . in order to successfully calibrate the baseline radial velocity variation , observations well before and after the transit are required .",
    "if the radial velocity can be well calibrated by observations before and after transit , the influence of uncertainty in the zero - point velocity offset ( @xmath11 ) will be negligible on the rm effect parameters .",

    "the only remaining notable exception is xo-3b , which was reported by @xcite to show a very significant misalignment of @xmath47 .",
    "the hd17156b system is extremely interesting because it has a very high eccentricity ( @xmath48 ) for such a short orbital period of 21.2days .",
    "most other transiting systems have much shorter orbital periods and eccentricities near zero",
    ". many of the interesting ways of getting a planet into this type of orbit might well result in the possibility of an orbital plane significantly inclined to the stellar equatorial plane .",
    "dynamical interactions with another nearby planet could result in ejection of the other body and a large orbital inclination of the surviving body .",
    "the presence of a third planet in the system , as suggested by @xcite , would have some effect on the orbital elements of hd17156b .",
    "however , as @xcite discussed , the primary effects are a small oscillation of the eccentricity and a secular advance of the argument of periastron . as long as the two planets are approximately coplanar",
