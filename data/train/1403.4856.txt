    "solar energetic particle ( sep ) @xmath0he - rich events are characterized by huge abundance enhancements of the rare isotope @xmath0he ( up to factors of @xmath310@xmath4 ) over solar system abundances .",
    "the enrichment of the @xmath0he is believed to be caused by selective heating due to wave - particle interaction in the flare plasma because of its unique charge to mass ratio ( see e.g. , reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "earlier studies have shown that @xmath0he - rich sep events are associated with 2 - 100  kev electron events @xcite and their related type iii radio bursts @xcite , which are excited by electrons streaming outward through interplanetary space ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the events have been associated with minor soft x - ray flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently the sources of @xmath0he - rich events have been investigated using extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) and x - ray solar images @xcite .",
    "the responsible source has often been attributed to a jet - like ejection near a coronal hole .",
    "sequences of @xmath0he - rich sep events from the same active region ( ar ) have been observed with a single spacecraft ( s / c ) @xcite only in a limited time interval ( about one day ) presumably due to loss of the magnetic connection to the flare site .",
    "these recurrent events may suggest almost continuous acceleration of @xmath0he in the single ar @xcite .",
    "in addition , multi - day periods of solar energetic @xmath0he have been recently discovered with the _ advanced composition explorer _ ( _ ace _ ) often with no individual @xmath0he - rich events resolved ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "such long periods have been interpreted as a combination of continuous production of @xmath0he - rich seps and their confinement in interplanetary magnetic field structures @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report , for the first time , on a @xmath0he - rich period of seps consecutively observed by three widely , in longitude , separated spacecraft _ stereo - b _ , _ ace _ and _ stereo - a _ with delays corresponding to the carrington rotation rate .",
    "the ultimate goal of this study is to identify activity on the sun and the conditions in interplanetary space leading to the long persistence of energetic @xmath0he in the heliosphere . in section  [ epo ] ,",

    "increases in the electron intensity were not detected by sept .",
    "the event was associated with b4.1 _ goes _ x - ray flare in the 1 - 8   range and h@xmath6 flare with a start time at 12:34  ut . according to the edited solar events",
    "lists compiled by the noaa space weather prediction center ( swpc ) the flare originated from ar 11244 ( n15w05  as viewed from earth ) and was accompanied by a type iii radio burst . from the _ stereo - b _ point of view the ar was located at @xmath5w97 .",

    "the spectrogram indicates that the number density of the ions started to increase roughly around 21  ut .",
    "taking the lower energy limit of the ions in figure  [ fig1]b the estimated injection on the sun would be at 14  ut . the 1-hr sept ion intensities in figure  [ fig1]c show only a minor ( factor of @xmath53 ) enhancement above the background .",
    "observations in figure  [ fig1]b show that the sit pulse - height points are spread over the whole helium mass range . to rule out @xmath4he spillover to the @xmath0he we compare in figure  [ fig2 ] helium sit - b histograms for the 2011 july 1 period and a typical corotating interaction region ( cir ) event , which is almost all @xmath4he .",
    "the figure clearly indicates a separate @xmath0he peak in the valley of the cir histogram .",
    "the @xmath0he/@xmath4he elemental ratio was determined by summing the counts in the two clearly separated he isotope peaks in the mass histogram .",
    "note that at higher energies the _ stereo - b_/let @xcite instrument shows no @xmath0he increase on july 1 - 2 in the he mass spectrogram plots in intervals 2.3 - 3.3 , 4.3 - 8.0  mevnucleon@xmath2 .",
    "the 385  kevnucleon@xmath2 @xmath0he/@xmath4he and fe / o abundance ratios for the @xmath0he - rich period in this study on all three spacecraft are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "figure  [ fig3 ] presents energetic particle and solar wind plasma parameters throughout the _ ace _ @xmath0he - rich period starting on 2011 july 7 and terminating at the end of 2011 july 10 .",
    "figure  [ fig3]a shows 5-min energetic electron intensities .",

    "the measurements in figure  [ fig3]a clearly show four impulsive solar energetic electron events with onset times at @xmath5 05:50 , 14:50 , 20:55  ut on 2011 july 7 and 03:20  ut on 2011 july 8 at 182  kev . on shorter time scales ,",
    "velocity dispersion is evident in all these electron events .",

    "the b7.6 and b6.4 flares do not have an assigned solar region in the event list .",

    "the 1-hr 0.23 - 0.32  mevnucleon@xmath2 @xmath0he intensity in figure  [ fig3]b shows two separate events or sub - periods , one starting near the end of 2011 july 7 ( @xmath521:00  ut ) and another at the beginning of 2011 july 9 ( @xmath501:00  ut ) .",
    "two double - ended arrows in figure  [ fig3]b denote the _ stereo - b _ and _ stereo - a _ @xmath0he - rich periods ( as in table [ tab1 ] ) shifted in corotation time . the partial overlap of the periods on all three s / c suggests a common solar origin . due to its smaller geometrical factor ,",
    "the sit instrument is less sensitive to the weak @xmath0he - rich events than the uleis . thus the @xmath0he - rich periods observed by uleis have generally longer duration .",
    "the high energy ( 0.4 - 10  mevnucleon@xmath2 ) mass spectrogram data ( figure  [ fig3]c ) show that the first @xmath0he ions arrived around 12:00  ut on 2011 july 7 .",
    "these are likely to be related to the first electron event seen on the same day .",
    "the 2011 july 7 @xmath0he - rich event itself may have come from multiple injections .",
    "the beginning of this period was probably associated with the second electron event .",
    "the estimated delay between 100  kev electrons and 0.23 - 0.32  mevnucleon@xmath2 ions traveling along the same path length from the sun to l1 would be @xmath56.5 hours , which approximately agrees with the observed time offset .",
    "there is a small additional @xmath0he intensity increase observed at the beginning of 2011 july 8 followed by increases in the heavy - ion ( fe and o ) intensities ( see figure  [ fig3]b ) .",
    "this increase could be related to the most intense electron event seen at the end of 2011 july 7 .",
    "it is not clear if any @xmath0he was associated with the solar electron event at the beginning of july 8 .",
    "the presence of an enhanced @xmath0he intensity from the previous activity along with a data gap at 05 - 11  ut would obscure any @xmath0he injection associated with this electron event .",
    "there were no observed electron increases closely preceding the 2011 july 9 @xmath0he - rich event .",
    "a small dispersed electron event at energy @xmath110  kev is seen on july 9 after the sep event start time . from figure  [ fig3]b",
    "we can see that the july 9 event is more enriched in @xmath0he and also shows higher @xmath0he intensities compared to the event on july 7 .",
    "the fe and o time lines lie nearly on top of each other for both events .",
    "the abundance ratios for these two _ ace _ events are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the time intervals used for calculating the ratios and fluences are only approximate and roughly coincide with the enhanced fe / o ratio .",
    "the _ ace_/sis @xcite instrument in the energy intervals 4.5 - 7.6 , 7.6 - 16.3  mevnucleon@xmath2 shows a high @xmath0he/@xmath4he ratio ( @xmath50.5 - 1.0 ) for the july 7 period in the spectrogram plots at the ace science center . on july 9 the @xmath0he in these high energy ranges is only seen during 00 - 06  ut .",
    "it was probably a continuation from previous day and related to the july 7 event .",
    "figure  [ fig3]d shows 1-hr _ ace_/epam @xcite ion intensities at 120  from the sunward pointing axis .",
    "the data from the telescope looking towards the sun ( lems30 ) are not available for energies @xmath11  mev .",
    "the intensity - time profiles in figure  [ fig3]d indicate a velocity dispersion at the onset of the july 7 event and a dispersionless onset for the july 9 event .",
    "the imf polarity color bar in figure  [ fig3 ] indicates that the two @xmath0he - rich events occurred in opposite magnetic polarity sectors .",
    "in addition , the intensity plots in figures  [ fig3]b and [ fig3]d show that the end of july 7 event and the start of july 9 event coincide with the interplanetary magnetic sector boundary crossing .",
    "the solar wind data in figure  [ fig3]e reveal a cir on july 9 , characterized by a gradual solar wind speed rise and the pressure enhancement . because of the data gap on _ ace _ the proton plasma density used in the total pressure is from the _",
    "wind_/swe @xcite instrument .",
    "the remaining solar wind parameters are from mag @xcite and swepam @xcite on _ ace_. cirs arise when fast solar wind , emerging from coronal holes , overtakes the preceding slow solar wind .",
    "the leading and trailing edge of the interaction region are characterized by an increase and decrease in the total pressure , respectively , and the enhanced pressure occurs in the rising part of the speed profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there is a gradual change in the flow direction from near radial to the east ( refer to figure  [ fig3]f ) at the beginning of july 9 , which is synchronized with the start of the slow rise in the solar wind speed .",
    "although the boundary between the two solar wind regimes here is not sharp , such a transition can indicate an evolving stream interface .",
    "apart from pure time evolution the s / c heliographic latitude could also be playing some role in the observed high - speed stream structure .",
    "we notice from figure  [ fig3 ] that the july 9 @xmath0he - rich event commenced before the interface , and close to the time that the change of the magnetic polarity occurred .",
    "it is interesting that the period of relatively enhanced @xmath0he on july 10 coincides with large variations in the high - speed solar wind and further deflection of the flow toward the east .",
    "the @xmath0he - rich period of interest starts for _ stereo - a _ on 2011 july 16 .",
    "the simultaneous energetic particle and solar wind plasma measurements during the @xmath0he - rich period on _ stereo - a _ are presented in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig4]a shows 10-min electron intensities from the ste - d anti - sunward and the sept sunward pointing sensors . no obvious solar electron event is seen in the presented time range . on 2011 july 16 the electron intensities were near background level .",
    "the ste electron intensities at higher energies were dominated by energetic ions ( see @xcite for a description of the background in ste ) .",
    "arrows in figure  [ fig4]a denote euv brightenings ( 12:40 , 14:15 , 18:45  ut ) and a jet ( 22:25  ut ) on july 15 identified in the next section ( section  [ aev ] ) .",
    "a marked @xmath0he enhancement is seen in the sit mass spectrogram in figure  [ fig4]b .",
    "there is a data gap on july 16 from 09:45 to 11:57  ut in the sit measurements at the beginning of the @xmath0he - rich period .",
    "therefore we plot in figure  [ fig4]c 1-hr ion intensities between 0.18 and 1.49  mev from the sept sunward sensor which did not suffer from this data gap .",
    "the onset at @xmath509:30  ut is clearly dispersionless with a simultaneous rise of ion intensities in all energy channels .",
    "note that the approximate delay time between ions in the lowest and highest energy channels in figure  [ fig4]c would be at least 5 hours . this estimate is based on scatter - free ion propagation ( with zero pitch angle ) along the spiral with a path length of 1.1  au to _ stereo - a _ , assuming a solar wind speed of 400  kms@xmath2 .",
    "dispersionless onset indicates that the first solar energetic particles arrived to 1  au before the s / c enters the flare connected field lines @xcite .",
    "this could also be the reason for the lack of electron enhancement .",
    "dispersionless @xmath0he - rich events associated with interplanetary shocks or magnetic clouds were reported by @xcite .",
    "the sept ion enhancements shown in figure  [ fig4]c are relatively minor and comparable with the pre - event intensities .",
    "the statistical errors of sept ion intensities during the @xmath0he - rich period are low and therefore not shown .",
    "for instance , the errors range between 0.1 and 0.3 in the highest energy channel .",
    "the second ( lower ) black curve in figure  [ fig4]c shows the 1.49  mev ion intensity from the sept anti - sunward pointing detector . the energetic ion fluxes appear to be only slightly anisotropic with intensities in the sunward pointing detector higher by about a factor of @xmath52 .",
    "similar small anisotropies were seen in the lower energy channels .",
    "the @xmath0he - rich events usually exhibit large ( outward to sunward ratio @xmath310 ) and long lasting anisotropies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we remark that sept is not capable of elemental resolution and most of the time protons are the contributors in the ion channels .",
    "however , for a @xmath0he - rich sep event , helium can account for a sizable amount @xcite .",
    "the elemental abundances for 2011 july 16 @xmath0he - rich event have been examined in an earlier report by @xcite .",
    "this study shows that heavy ions are also enriched in this event with the relative abundances of elements ( ne - s ) and fe typical of @xmath0he - rich sep events ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the 385  kevnucleon@xmath2 @xmath0he/@xmath4he and fe / o ratios for this event are in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the _ stereo - a_/let instrument shows a clear @xmath0he increase for the july 16 event in the energy interval 2.3 - 3.3  mevnucleon@xmath2 with a high @xmath0he/@xmath4he ratio ( @xmath31 ) but not in 4.3 - 8.0  mevnucleon@xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig4]d shows 10-min averages of solar wind speed @xmath7 and total pressure @xmath8 .",
    "the shaded region marks the time interval of a cir obtained from a list compiled by the _ stereo _",
    "magnetometer team at the university of california los angeles ( ucla ) , based on plasma and magnetic field data @xcite .",
    "note that the total pressure @xmath8 peak is a factor of @xmath52 higher than in the cir on 2011 july 9 .",
    "we see in figure  [ fig4]d that the cir trailing boundary is well - defined with a jump - like decrease ( increase ) in the pressure @xmath8 ( speed @xmath7 ) , suggestive of a developing reverse shock .",
    "the dashed vertical line indicates the stream interface ( si ) , separating slow and fast stream plasma , characterized by a sharp discontinuity in the azimuthal flow direction ( figure  [ fig4]e ) and a jump in the flow speed ( figure  [ fig4]d ) @xcite .",
    "other characteristics of the stream interface such as abrupt and simultaneous drops in plasma proton density and rise in proton temperature were also observed . a more detailed investigation of the solar wind plasma data revealed a smooth north to south rotation of the magnetic field vector over 120  during a relatively short time period ( @xmath54  hr ) around the peak of the total pressure .",
    "this feature together with a strong magnetic field ( up to @xmath520  nt ) and local decrease in @xmath10 tentatively suggests the presence of a magnetic cloud embedded within the cir .",
    "however other essential characteristics of a magnetic cloud , such as abnormal @xmath11 depression @xcite and bidirectional beams of suprathermal ( @xmath5100  ev ) electrons @xcite were not observed .",
    "the pitch angle distribution of suprathermal electrons on _ stereo _ was examined in data from the swea instrument @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the magnetic field rotation occurred near the sector boundary crossing and thus may be related to the complex magnetic morphology in the heliospheric current sheet @xcite .",
    "note that the purported magnetic cloud is not included in the comprehensive list of the _ stereo _ interplanetary coronal mass ejections compiled by the previously cited team at ucla .",
    "recently , @xcite presented several cases of similar cloud - like small structures embedded within the cir which probably favored the formation of reverse shocks , resulting in enhanced ion acceleration .",
    "the observations in figure  [ fig4 ] indicate that ion intensities and @xmath0he counts on july 16 commence to increase near the stream interface and show a maximum in the vicinity of the cir trailing edge .",
    "such ion intensity increases are commonly observed in ion intensity - time profiles in cir events at 1  au ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we emphasize here that the ion intensities tend to peak simultaneously at all energies .",
    "particularly , the low energy channels show a pronounced peak at the trailing boundary which indicates that the energy spectrum was locally modified . in the standard basic picture of cir acceleration",
    ", particles can be pre - heated inside the compression region ( e.g. , by a stochastic mechanism ) and then accelerated in the reverse shock formed at the cir trailing boundary .",
    "the stream interface is usually assumed to be a tangential discontinuity through which particle transport is not expected to occur .",
    "therefore the ion intensity decreases towards the interface in the cirs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "weak , sunward streaming of ions with energy @xmath31",
    "mevnucleon@xmath2 has been reported in cir events at 1  au @xcite , indicating their source is in the outer heliosphere , while low energy ions ( @xmath1300  kev ) showed anti - sunward streaming in the compressed solar wind inside cirs @xcite .",
    "we can see in figure  [ fig4]d that the high speed solar wind is quite variable behind the interface .",
    "an interesting feature of the high speed wind in the middle of july 17 is the weaker helium enhancement , mainly seen in the @xmath4he isotope .",
    "the enhancement commences when there is a sharp drop in the speed and another deflection of the flow toward the east , while the pressure stays at the background level .",
    "this has similarities to the l1 observations on july 10 in the high - speed solar wind .",
    "@xmath4he intensity variations coincident with increases or decreases in solar wind speed have been previously noticed by @xcite in the cir events .",
    "the variations have been attributed to the changes in connection of the spacecraft to different locations in the cir outside 1  au .",
    "we find that the 137  kevnucleon@xmath2 fe / o abundance ratio is 0.20@xmath130.07 during the helium enhancement on july 17 between 08 and 16  ut .",
    "note that statistically significant fe / o ratios at higher energies were not available in this time interval .",
    "while the helium isotope ratio ( @xmath0he/@xmath4he ) remains enhanced during this interval ( as implied by the mass spectrogram ) the fe / o is smaller than the typical ratio in @xmath0he - rich events ( @xmath50.95 at 385  kevnucleon@xmath2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but somewhat above the value typical for cir events ( @xmath50.08 at 150  kevnucleon@xmath2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or ( @xmath50.10 at 137  kevnucleon@xmath2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggesting that a mixed population co - existed during this time interval in the high - speed solar wind .",
    "further , figure  [ fig4]b shows a brief @xmath4he increase at the beginning of july 16 which occurred inside the compression region preceding the stream interface .",
    "ion intensity enhancements in this part of cirs have been related to the cir forward shock acceleration @xcite .",
    "the enhancements were less intense or even not present at 1  au with larger h / he ratio ( @xmath543 ) @xcite than that associated with the cir trailing edge ( e.g. , @xmath512.5 at 386  kevnucleon@xmath2 in the survey of * ? ? ?",
    "the 386  kevnucleon@xmath2 h / he ratio integrated through this @xmath4he increase between 23  ut on july 15 and 04  ut on july 16 is 45.4@xmath138.1 and it is strikingly similar to the h / he ratio reported by @xcite for corotating increases in the slow solar wind . the heavy - ion count rates during this enhancement were weak with the ne - s and fe fluences statistically not significant ( with errors greater than 0.5 ) in the sit energy range .",
    "to determine the solar origin of the @xmath0he - rich seps described in the previous section we identify the s / c magnetic connection location on the sun and then examine flaring at this location using the euv solar images .",
    "for the events which are associated with energetic electrons and x - ray flares the identification of the responsible solar source is more straightforward compared to the cases which lack such an association . in these situations",
    "we also use the radio data which generally show wider longitude coverage than their parent electrons . @xcite",

    "we also check whether the in - situ magnetic field polarity matches the polarity from the pfss extrapolations .",
    "the top panel in figure  [ fig5 ] shows that the _ stereo - b _ footpoint at the start time of the 2011 july 1 @xmath0he - rich period was located near the positive ( green ) field lines of the low - latitude coronal hole and @xmath5510  away from the negative ( red ) field lines emanating from ar 11243 and ar 11244 .",
    "it was pointed out that the footpoint longitude , based on a simple parker spiral with a constant solar wind speed , can only be estimated within @xmath1310@xcite .",
    "the in - situ polarity ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) suggests that the main connection was via negative field , although a few short excursions to the positive field near the beginning of the event are also present .",
    "since the intersection points of the negative polarity field lines from the two ars , 11243 and 11244 , have equal distance to the _ stereo - b _ footpoint , it is not possible to unambiguously determine the connection region on the sun .",
    "the second panel in figure  [ fig5 ] shows the l1 footpoint at the start time of 2011 july 7 @xmath0he - rich event was connected via negative ( red ) field lines to ar 11244 . at that time",
    "the earth was generally in the negative polarity sector with some deviations from the nominal parker field direction as indicated by the yellow coding in the polarity color bar in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "one can see in the third panel of figure  [ fig5 ] that at the start time of 2011 july 9 event the l1 footpoint on the source surface was between the positive ( green ) field lines of the low - latitude coronal hole ( with nearby ar 11246 ) and negative ( red ) field lines of ar 11243 .",
    "the in - situ polarity in figure  [ fig3 ] suggests connection via positive field .",

    "the coronal hole was presumably the source of the high - speed solar wind responsible for the cirs observed on july 9 by near - earth s / c and on july 16 by _ stereo - a_. furthermore , the sequence of the photospheric maps with a modeled coronal field showed that both july 9 and july 16 @xmath0he - rich periods terminated when the s / c lost the connection to the coronal hole .",

    "@xcite for instance associated the sources of @xmath0he - rich events with filament eruptions .",
    "ar 11244 remained active for some time , producing for example several x - ray flares ( mainly b class ) on 2011 july 3 , as reported in the noaa list .",
    "the 2011 july 7 @xmath0he - rich event was associated with two solar electron events whose associated b7.6 and b6.4 x - ray flares were not assigned to an ar in the noaa / swpc list .",
    "our suggested magnetic connection region on the sun is ar 11244 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig5 ] ( 2011-jul-7.9 panel ) the region was near the west solar limb as seen from earth .",

    "previously the 195   channel ( @xmath51.6  mk and @xmath520  mk ) has been used to identify @xmath0he - rich seps sources @xcite , but we found the brightening on the west limb easier to distinguish from the bright surroundings in the 131   euv images . one interesting feature seen in the euv 193   images was the presence of the large scale loops across the whole ar 11243 while such topology was not obvious in ar 11244 .",
    "this is consistent with the pfss model showing no open field in ar 11243 ( see 2011-jul-7.9 panel in figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "although it is not clear whether the early 2011 july 8 electron event was accompanied by @xmath0he emission ( due to the data gap and elevated intensity from the previous activity ) we check the solar source for these electrons .",
    "the associated b3.0 ( 02:53  ut ) x - ray flare is assigned to ar 11243 in the noaa / swpc list . however , with the _ stereo - a _ euv images we see a quite impressive eruption in ar 11244 at the time of the b3.0 flare and only minor brightening in ar 11243 .",
    "ar 11244 was @xmath52  behind the west solar limb , but the expulsion was also well visible in the euv images on _ sdo_. the configuration of the modeled coronal fields shown in panel 2011-jul-7.9 in figure  [ fig5 ] would be valid also for the early 2011 july 8 electron event suggesting a most probable connection to ar 11244 .",
    "furthermore , we note from figure  [ fig3]a that the onset of this electron event is slower compared to the preceding electron events , which may be caused by the longer path length for electron propagation as ar 11244 rotated further away .",
    "we conclude that multiple electron events in figure  [ fig3]a , seen within a span of less than one day have the same solar origin - ar 11244 . in the earlier surveys ,",

    "no type iii bursts were recorded by waves instruments on _ wind _ or _ stereo - a _ s / c @xcite in association with these brightenings . also no associated electron events were detected by the near earth s / c as seen in figure  [ fig3]a .",

    "the low - latitude coronal hole , the _ ace _",

    "the @xmath17-shaped structure appears to be consistent with the general scenario of jets created by reconnection between open and closed field lines @xcite .",
    "the lower panel in figure  [ fig8 ] shows all three ars 11246 , 11243 and 11244 in the 5-minute difference image from _ stereo - a _ 195   euvi on 2011 july 8 16:25  ut .",
    "one can see the most prominent brightening in ar 11246 located at e55 .",
    "note that due to projection effects , bright features in ar 11246 appear smaller than in ar 11244 which is located near the central meridian ( w05 ) .",
    "ar 11246 produced several other eruptions on 2011 july 9 - 10 after the sep event start time . on july 11",
    "the ar had rotated close to the west solar limb and was barely visible with _ sdo_. but at that time _ stereo - a _ euvi was able to see ar 11246 near the central meridian with continuing activity .",
    "the ar decayed in the middle of 2011 july 12 , but it still produced sporadic jets on 2011 july 13 - 14 before the region re - emerged with an even smaller size at the end of july 14 .",
    "it has been shown that _",
    "stereo - a _ was connected to the same low - latitude coronal hole during the 2011 july 16 @xmath0he - rich period .",
    "in contrast to the previous case there were two new bright solar regions in the vicinity of the coronal hole , one relatively small region beneath the coronal hole southern boundary ( hereafter a1 ) and a larger one ( hereafter a2 ) @xmath510  west of ar 11246 .",
    "the region a1 started to emerge on 2011 july 11 and a2 on 2011 july 10 . when it started to emerge the larger region a2 was at @xmath5n08w80  as viewed from the earth and reached its full size behind the solar west limb .",
    "therefore the region does not clearly show up in the photospheric maps and the pffs extrapolations probably could not properly determine the open field region .",
    "the limitations of the pfss model for unobserved areas especially above rapidly evolving active regions have been discussed by @xcite .",

    "the lower panel is the difference between the two euv images taken at 22:25 and 22:20  ut . in the difference image we can see jet - like emission at the western edge of the coronal hole and no significant brightening in other regions .",
    "the site of this jet coincides with carrington longitude of ar 11246 . the coronal hole seen in _",
    "stereo - a _ euvi reveals the presence of the open field region , as inferred from the model field .",
    "the region a2 showed one material eruption and one brightening in the first half of july 15 .",
    "careful inspection of this region in the euv 195   images reveals a closed magnetic field configuration for most of the time presumably preventing any energetic particles from escaping .",
    "the region a1 showed no significant brightening in euv .",
    "in addition to the jet in ar 11246 seen near the end of the day , the region showed three distinct brightenings earlier on july 15 at 12:40 , 14:15 and 18:45  ut .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] shows these brightenings in a wider area of the western hemisphere to demonstrate that no other regions were simultaneously active .",
    "bright patches on the west limb were associated with ar 11244 . _",
    "stereo - b _ saw ar 11244 at @xmath5e80 , and obtained higher cadence ( 2.5-min ) euv 195   images but revealed no exceptional activity . from the figure",
    "we can see , that brightenings in ar 11246 do not have a collimated ejection or jet - like structure .",
    "it has been previously reported that some sources of @xmath0he show only amorphous brightening @xcite .",
    "those authors pointed out that a jet could have been missed because of the low time cadence ( 12-minute ) of the euv observations available . in our case",
    "missed jets would have a duration less than 5 minutes .",
    "it is important to note that during the jets and brightenings in ar 11246 on july 15 , _ stereo - a _ was magnetically connected via negative field to nearby ar 11243 .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] ( upper panel ) shows the _ stereo - a_/waves radio spectrogram for the second half of 2011 july 15 with several type iii bursts . it is interesting that all three brightenings in ar 11246 on july 15 , marked by arrows in figure  [ fig12 ] , coincide with prominent type iii emissions",
    "this indicates that electrons are accelerated in this region and escape into the interplanetary medium along the open field lines .",
    "these three bursts are characterized by similar frequency - time profiles and extend to the local plasma frequency at 1  au ( @xmath1850  khz e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that the jet at 22:25  ut ( not marked in the radio spectrogram ) was associated with a narrow type iii burst which does not extend down to the low frequencies as in the previous three cases implying that the causative electrons probably did not reach @xmath51  au .",
    "temporal association of type iii radio bursts with euv jets in solar impulsive electron events has been reported in recent studies @xcite .",
    "further exploration of _ stereo - a _ radio data shows that there were no significant type iii bursts found on 2011 july 16 before the event start time .",
    "we have also examined the _",
    "wind_/waves radio spectrogram of 2011 july 8 . except for a type iii",
    "burst associated with the electron event at the beginning of the day there were two other significant type iii emissions on july 8 with start times at 11:37 and 16:25  ut as shown in the lower panel in figure  [ fig12 ] .",
    "the first one is associated with the eastern hemisphere ar 11247 and c2 class flare in the noaa / swpc flare list , and the second one does not have any source association in the list .",
    "however , at the time of the second type iii burst ( 16:25  ut ) the _ sdo _ euv images showed a jet - like eruption in ar 11246 displayed in figure  [ fig8 ] .",
    "such temporal coincidence implies their common origin and indicates energetic electrons escaping from ar 11246 into interplanetary space .",
    "we remark that the l1 s / c were in a negative magnetic polarity sector at the time of jet - like eruption and thus not connected to ar 11246 at the periphery of the coronal hole .",
    "we note another brightening mentioned in section  [ 9ev ] in _",
    "sdo_/aia euv observations in ar 11246 on july 8 just close to the time of the type iii burst at 11:37  ut .",
    "this may imply a false association of this type iii burst with ar 11247 in the swpc list .",
    "we have examined @xmath0he - rich periods of seps observed consecutively by the _ stereo - b _ , _ ace _ , and _ stereo - a _ spacecraft when they were widely separated in longitude . the period observed by _ ace _ consists of two distinct @xmath0he - rich events . the period observed by _ stereo - b _ on 2011 july 1 and later by _ ace _ on 2011 july 7",
    "was associated with a sizeable active region , ar 11244 .",
    "the ar produced energetic electron events with associated type iii bursts , soft x - ray flares and a h@xmath6-flare .",
    "the period is characterized by a moderate @xmath0he - enrichment ( @xmath0he/@xmath4he @xmath11 ) .",
    "the period observed by _ ace _ on 2011 july 9 and later by _ stereo - a _ on 2011 july 16 was presumably associated with the small , compact ar 11246 located at the border of the coronal hole and showed very high @xmath0he - enrichment and fluence , the highest so far detected on _",
    "stereo_. the source region produced euv jets correlated with type iii bursts and exhibited highly dynamic behavior .",
    "for example , when the active region temporarily disappeared the site continued with jet - like emissions .",
    "the characteristics of the events in this study are consistent with earlier suggestions that small flares have probably more favorable conditions for the @xmath0he enrichments of seps than large flares @xcite , and that different size or morphology of the source active region with diverse flaring could produce a @xmath0he - rich event @xcite .    in spite of a dispersionless onset and absence of energetic electrons in the july 9 and",
    "16 events the high cadence euv images combined with the radio observations allowed us to determine the likely source brightening for the @xmath0he emission .",
    "the approximate travel time of solar @xmath0he ions with an energy 0.23 - 0.32  mevnucleon@xmath2 is about 7 hours to _ ace _ along a nominal spiral with length of 1.2  au .",
    "if the @xmath0he was released during the eruption in ar 11246 at 16:30  ut on 2011 july 8 the ions with that energy should have been detected at the beginning of july 9 , which is approximately consistent with the start of the event in the low energy time - intensity profile in figure  [ fig3]b . since the s / c was not connected to the coronal hole ( and to the source ar ) around the eruption time it missed the electrons and the first - arriving , higher - energy ions .",
    "this explains the lack of velocity dispersion in the ions received after the s / c enters the field lines connected to the coronal hole .",
    "if the release of the energetic ions for the 2011 july 16 period was associated for example with the jet and type iii radio burst at 22:25  ut on july 15 then the lowest energy ions ( 0.18  mev ) shown in figure  [ fig4]c should arrive at _ stereo - a _ around 06:30  ut on july 16 ( i.e. , three hours before the dispersionless event onset ) . if the ions were released during the brightening at 18:45  ut , which was associated with the prominent type iii burst , the highest energy ions ( 1.49  mev ) should have only a @xmath53  hr delay after the flare .",
    "this leads to the question of where these high energy solar ions , with enormous @xmath0he enrichment , were residing in the heliosphere for about half of the day prior to the observed onset .",
    "the timing of the ion intensities in the 2011 july 16 period indicates that energetic @xmath0he is closely associated with the cir which is further supported by the pre- and post - event abundances .",
    "such association may arise when a source active region is located at the periphery of the coronal hole with open field lines bending to the ecliptic .",
    "the high - speed solar wind emanating from the hole may create a corotating compression region in the heliosphere near @xmath51 au .",
    "thus the energetic @xmath0he injected from the solar source near the hole is guided by the open field to the cir .",
    "the propagation of seps in the compressed field in cirs has been modeled by @xcite .",
    "the authors employed the @xcite model of cir acceleration on the solar wind speed gradients at 1  au .",
    "their simulations show that the magnetic enhancement associated with the cir presents a kind of magnetic mirror away from the sun where solar particles may be temporally trapped and re - accelerated . indeed",
    ", our observations show a significant sunward component during the 2011 july 16 @xmath0he - rich period indicating a reflecting boundary beyond the observer .",
    "@xcite have reported on multi - day @xmath0he - rich periods that essentially all have dispersionless onset and were associated with compression in the solar wind but such convincing associations as in the july 16 period have not been presented .",
    "those authors suggest that confinement of particles in cirs is a significant factor of extended @xmath0he - rich periods of seps .",
    "it is not clear if the weaker cir seen during the 2011 july 9 @xmath0he - rich period had a marked influence on the seps .",
    "the event commenced with a change of the magnetic connection and not with the start of the solar wind speed rise or at the cir stream interface although the later was not fully developed . presumably at larger radial distances where",
    "the corotating compression regions are found to be stronger , a closer association might exist .",
    "@xcite concluded that the effects of the compression may be important if the observed solar wind speed increase near earth is more than 100  kms@xmath2 within a few hours .",
    "in the 2011 july 9 cir , such a speed change is observed during a quite long @xmath512  hr period .",
    "notice that no significant concurrent cir event was observed in association with the 2011 july 9 and july 16 compression corotating regions .",
    "that means at least for the strong july 16 compression that the bulk solar wind was not accelerated in the cir .",
    "it is consistent with recent suggestions that cir ions are accelerated out of the suprathermal ion pool @xcite . in the case of the july 16 cir",
    "the suprathermal population was probably dominated by the @xmath0he - rich seps which might undergo acceleration in the strong compression region .",
    "these small sep events are often difficult to conclusively identify with source activity in active periods when there may be multiple candidates . in the july 9 event",
    "the s / c footpoint lies in a reasonable distance from both ars 11246 and 11244 .",
    "note that the distance to ar 11244 was still within 3@xmath19 ( @xmath548 ) of the flare longitudes distribution associated with @xmath0he - rich sep events derived by @xcite .",
    "there are a few reasons to choose ar 11246 over ar 11244 .",
    "the type iii emissions at 11:37 and 16:25  ut preceding the july 9 event were probably associated with ar 11246 because of their temporal coincidence with the euv brightenings in this ar ; the brightenings , fainter at these times in ar 11244 were not new and likely continued from the previous activity .",
    "if the type iii burst at 16:25  ut was associated with ar 11244 then why do we not detect escaping electrons , while being in a negative imf sector and presumably connected to ar 11244 ?",
    "another reason in favor of ar 11246 is the reversal of the imf to the polarity at ar 11246 at the start of the july 9 event .",
    "although ar 11244 continued with some activity on july 15 - 16 , the type iii bursts at 12:40 , 14:15 and 18:45  ut on july 15 appear to be correlated with euv brightenings in ar 11246 .",
    "note that some ambiguity may still remain in locating these type iii bursts because we use lower ( 5 minute ) cadence euvi data .",
    "_ wind_/waves observed weak and only low - frequency counterparts of these bursts .",
    "_ stereo - b_/waves did not record any type iii emission on july 15 in the same time period as _ stereo - a_. this implies that the source was well hidden from the _ stereo - b _ view , which was not case of ar 11244 .",
    "in addition , the ar 11244 location is less likely to be the source for the @xmath0he - rich event on _ stereo - a_. we have shown that the _ stereo - a _ footpoint was co - located with the coronal hole ( containing ar 11246 ) , while ar 11244 was quite far , 60  west of the footpoint .    in conclusion , with the advantage of widely separated spacecraft carrying advanced imaging , radio and particle instrumentation , supported by the modeling of the coronal field , we have identified solar ars which exhibited repeated energetic electron and @xmath0he emissions for a relatively long interval of time , up to about a quarter of a solar rotation .",
    "this is significantly longer than single s / c observations which previously reported @xmath0he injections from the same ar over a period of one day .",
    "thus this study suggests that the conditions for the @xmath0he acceleration in a single solar region may persist for a long time .",
    "furthermore the observations in this paper show that a recurrent @xmath0he - rich period can be preserved in the solar wind by confining seps in the cir .",
    "the observations of a long - lived recurrent period presented in this study may provide new insights on the acceleration of @xmath0he ions in the solar flares and their transport in the heliosphere .",
    "in particular , extended @xmath0he - rich periods recently discovered with single s / c observations may be naturally explained by multiple injections from the same ar which may presumably last over days .",
