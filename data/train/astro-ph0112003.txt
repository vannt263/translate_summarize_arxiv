    "the supernova remnant ( snr )  ( msh  155_2 _ ) has unusual radio and x - ray properties . at radio wavelengths ( figure  [ fig_1 ] ) , its morphology is dominated by two distinct limbs of radio emission . superimposed on the northern limb is a bright core of emission , coincident with the h@xmath0 nebula rcw  89 .",
    "the distinctly non - circular appearance of this source has been attributed to expansion into an elongated cavity , a claim supported by recent  observations of this region ( dubner  2002 ) .",
    "absorption towards the snr demonstrates it to be at a distance of 5  kpc ( gaensler  1999 ) .    at x - ray energies ( figure  [ fig_1 ] ) , the system is dominated by a bright central point source .",
    "this corresponds to the pulsar , which has also been detected at radio wavelengths and in @xmath1-rays .",
    "psr  is one of the youngest and most energetic pulsars known : it has a spin - period @xmath2  ms , a magnetic field",
    "@xmath3  g , a spin - down luminosity @xmath4  erg  s@xmath5 and a characteristic age @xmath6  yr .",
    "surrounding the pulsar is an elongated non - thermal nebula , presumed to be the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) powered by the pulsar s spin - down ; no radio counterpart to this pwn has been identified . to the north of psr  is a source of thermal x - rays , coincident with the bright radio and optical emission from rcw  89 ( trussoni  1996 ; tamura  1996 ) .",
    "existing observations have raised a number of issues regarding this pulsar and its interaction with its environment .",
    "firstly , the elongated morphology of the pwn suggests that its morphology is dominated by a collimated outflow directed along the pulsar spin - axis , which possibly collides with and is interacting with the rcw  89 region ( manchester & durdin 1983 ; tamura  1996 ; brazier & becker 1997 ; gaensler  1999 ) .",
    "greiveldinger  ( 1995 ) have claimed that there is a compact disc of nebular emission immediately surrounding the pulsar , while brazier & becker ( 1997 ) rather propose a `` cross''-shaped morphology in this region , which they interpret as an equatorial torus and polar jets , seen edge - on .    clearly",
    "our understanding of this complicated source can benefit from observations at higher angular resolution .",
    "we have consequently carried out observations of psr  and its surroundings with the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. we summarize these results below ; these data are discussed in more detail by gaensler  ( 2002 ) .",
    "psr  was observed with the acis - i detector on  on 2000  aug  14 , with an effective exposure time of 19  ks .",
    "the resulting image is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig_2 ] .",
    "a number of features can be seen in this   shows the region immediately surrounding the pulsar at the full resolution of the data .",
    "this figure shows an inner arc sitting inside feature f ( marked as 1 ) , and several knots close to the pulsar ( 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) .",
    "we have extracted over 50000 counts from the diffuse pwn ( feature c in figure  [ fig_2 ] ) ; these data show no spectral features . fitting them with a power law",
    ", we find an absorbing column @xmath7  @xmath8 and a photon index @xmath9 , in good agreement with previous results .",
    "the brighter features superimposed on this diffuse emission all have distinctly harder spectra : the `` jet '' ( feature  d ) , outer arc ( f ) and inner arc ( 1 ) all have @xmath10 , while the innermost knots ( 25 ) all have @xmath11 .",
    "the spectrum of the rcw  89 region shows several clear emission lines , confirming its interpretation as a thermal source distinct from the other components of the system ( e.g.  tamura  1996 ) .",
    "preliminary analysis of these data shows that the emission can be approximately fit by a non - equilibrium ionization model with variable abundances .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_3 ] , diffuse radio emission seen in the vicinity of the pulsar closely matches the extent of the diffuse x - ray pwn ( feature  c in figure  [ fig_2 ] ) .",
    "it thus seems clear that this radio emission is the long - sought radio pwn .",
    "an elongated region of reduced radio emission can be seen to the south of the pulsar , corresponding closely to the morphology of the x - ray `` jet '' ( feature  d ) .",
    "this argues that this is a physically distinct structure within the nebula , and does not simply result from variations in brightness .",
    "the x - ray emission surrounding  shows a clear symmetry axis , oriented at a position angle @xmath12 ( n through e ) , and manifested on all spatial scales between @xmath13  pc and @xmath14  pc .",
    "such alignment can only be enforced by the central pulsar .",
    "we think it likely that this axis represents the spin - axis of the pulsar , as has also been argued for the crab and vela pulsars ( hester  1995 ; helfand , gotthelf & halpern 2001 ) .",
    "a variety of different arguments imply that the magnetic field in the pwn is approximately 8  @xmath15 g ( see gaensler  2002 for details ) .",
    "this is an order of magnitude weaker than in the crab nebula , and implies a spectral break due to synchrotron cooling just below the x - ray band .",
    "this low magnetic field is most likely a result of the low density of the medium into which the pwn has expanded ( bhattacharya 1990 ) .",
    "it is unlikely the pulsar is much older than @xmath16 ( e.g.  gvaramadze , these proceedings ) , as this would require an even lower nebular field strength , not consistent with other estimates .",
    "feature  d has a distinctly harder synchrotron spectrum than the surrounding pwn .",
    "if the injected electron spectrum in the two regions is the same and the spectral difference between them is due to synchrotron cooling , it can be shown that the flow velocity in feature  d must be @xmath17 ( gaensler  2002 ) .",
    "thus this source corresponds to a true jet , which we have calculated carries away @xmath18 of @xmath19 .",
    "this jet is directed along the pulsar spin - axis , and appears to be a much larger and more spectacular version of similar features seen for the crab and vela pwne ( hester  1995 ; helfand  2001 ) .    while no direct counterpart to this outflow can be seen to the north of the pulsar , the collimated nature of feature  e",
    "suggests that we are seeing a cylindrical sheath of emission around an unseen counter - jet .",
    "this lack of direct emission can be simply explained by doppler boosting , provided the jet axis is inclined by @xmath20 to the line - of - sight .",
    "this is contrary to the edge - on morphology , @xmath21 , argued by brazier & becker ( 1997 ) from lower - resolution data .",
    "feature  f is distinctly one - sided , and so can potentially be interpreted as a bow - shock driven by the pulsar . however , this feature is embedded within a much larger pwn , in which the pulsar s velocity can not be supersonic .",
    "we thus prefer to interpret this arc as a toroidal structure , lying in a plane perpendicular to the main symmetry axis . in this case",
    ", the projected morphology of the arc implies @xmath22 , consistent with the estimate made above from doppler boosting of the jet .",
    "considered together , the inner and outer arcs ( features  1 and f respectively ) resemble the inner ring and outer torus seen in  images of the crab nebula ( weisskopf  2000 ; mori , these proceedings ) .",
    "there are two characteristic time - scales associated with such structures : the time - scale for radiative losses via synchrotron emission , and the flow time from the pulsar . in the torus of the crab nebula ,",
    "these times are comparable . however , for psr  the radiative time - scale is @xmath23 times longer than the flow time due to the lower nebular magnetic field .",
    "thus the arcs seen here must be dynamical , not radiative , features in the pwn .",
    "we show elsewhere that they can be interpreted as `` wisps '' as seen in the crab nebula , resulting from ion compression in a particle - dominated flow ( arons , these proceedings ; gaensler  2002 ) . in this case",
    ", we might expect outward motion of these features as is seen for the crab .",
    "the expected proper motion would be a few arcsec per year , easily detectable with .",
    "an interpretation for the knots close to the pulsar ( features 25 ) is less clear .",
    "these knots may be emission from the unshocked pulsar wind , analogous to `` knot  1 '' and `` knot  2 '' seen with _ hst _  close to the crab pulsar ( hester  1995 ) .",
    "these  data have provided a wealth of new information on psr  and its interaction with its environment . we have confirmed the presence of a collimated flow directed along the pulsar spin - axis , and have argued that the flow is relativistic and is inclined at @xmath24 to our line - of - sight .",
    "we have interpreted two arcs of emission seen close to the pulsar as dynamical features in an equatorial flow , and have identified several knots at separations @xmath25  pc from the pulsar .",
    "many issues still need to be investigated .",
    "do the arcs and knots show motion and/or variability ? do any of these features have counterparts at other wavelengths ? what is the nature of rcw  89 and its thermal clumps ? while these questions still remain , it is clear that psr  provides a new opportunity to probe the detailed structure of a pulsar wind .",
