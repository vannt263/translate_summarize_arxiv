    "the electron systems have attracted our much attention in the low and high energy physics . as the dimension of the electron systems decrease",
    ", the charge screening effects become less important . in spite of these facts models with short range interactions",
    "have been adopted in many researches of one dimensional electron systems .",
    "the recent advanced technology make it possible to fabricate quasi - one - dimension systems . actually in a low temperature the effect of coulomb forces",
    "have been observed in @xmath6 quantum wires @xcite , quasi - one - dimensional conductors @xcite and 1d carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "a role of a @xmath7 coulomb repulsive force was investigated on long distance properties by bosonization techniques @xcite .",
    "the charge correlation decays very slowly with distance suggesting that the ground state is the _ wigner crystal _ rather than the tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) .",
    "on one hand the insulator - metal transition caused by the long - range ( lr ) coulomb interactions have been discussed @xcite . for @xmath8 type weak interactions the ground state is tll which is explained by the gaussian cft @xcite .",
    "it was reported that the strong @xmath8 interactions make the system gapless to gapful through the generalized kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to find the precise finite size scaling of energies and estimate the range of tll in the strength space of the @xmath9 type lr interactions for various powers @xmath3 .",
    "the strategy is as follows . in section @xmath10 a and b we discuss the long wavelength behaviors of the system when we consider the lr forward scatterings by making use of bosonization techniques and the renormalization group ( rg ) method . in the section @xmath10 c",
    "we find the corrections caused by such the @xmath11 lr forwards scatterings in the finite size scaling of energies and the thermodynamics . in the section @xmath12",
    ", we analyze a tight - binding model with the @xmath11 type lr interactions numerically by considering these corrections in the finite size scaling .",
    "we show numerical data of the drude weight and compressibility and determine the range of tll in the interactions strength space . in section @xmath13",
    "we argue the case @xmath1 .",
    "schulz analyzed the effect of lr coulomb interactions by bosonization technique @xcite .",
    "we extend the action to general @xmath14 type interactions .",
    "namely we write the action : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the tl parameter .",
    "the second term in ( 2.1 ) comes from the forward scattering in the fermion picture . precisely speaking , there are other oscillating terms in the effective action .",
    "now we focus on what happens in considering only the forward scattering terms of the charge density freedom .",
    "we shall discuss the effects of the oscillating terms later in the section @xmath12 .",
    "this action is known for kibble s model @xcite , the interactions of which induce the mass gap in three dimension when @xmath1 .",
    "the situations in one dimension are different from that in three dimension .    to discuss in the fourier space we choose the form @xmath18 which contains the cut - off @xmath19 in order to remove the ultra - violet divergences .",
    "the expression in the wave number space of this action is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fourier transformation of @xmath22 in one dimension . from this",
    "the dispersion relation is @xmath23 we can derive the long wavelength behavior of @xmath21 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are constant ( see appendix a ) . from this",
    "we see that the system is gapless when @xmath26 and it is expected to be tll when @xmath2 , that is , @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath1 , the lr interactions drive the ground state from tll to the _ wigner crystal_@xcite .",
    "the slowest decaying part of the density correlation function is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a function of k @xcite .",
    "this feature is not like that of tll : @xmath30      for the moment we focus our argument on the case @xmath2 and @xmath31 odd integer which is expected to belongs to tll from the dispersion relations ( 2.4 ) .",
    "as the c term in similarities ( 2.4 ) give the linear dispersion , the c term is marginal . to see the essence of lr interactions we separate the interactions term @xmath32 into two parts : @xmath33 equivalently the expression in real space is @xmath34",
    "hence the present action is rewritten to @xmath35 we derive the rg eq . of g : @xmath36 ( see appendix b. ) .",
    "just later we also find the consistency of this eq . by conformal field theory .    for the case",
    "@xmath37 we can derive the rg eq .",
    "of @xmath32 and the velocity(see appendix b. ) .      we know the energy size scaling in the gaussian cft @xcite",
    ": @xmath38 considering the lr interactions , we can extract the corrections from these energy size scalings precisely ( see appendix c. ) : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is not odd integer . for the @xmath41 odd integer , the logarithmic corrections appear .",
    "the details are shown in appendix c and the @xmath1 case is discussed later .",
    "the @xmath42 terms come from the irrelevant field @xmath43 and the lr g term .",
    "the first scaling of eqs .",
    "( 2.12 ) implys that the lr forward scatterings @xmath44 have the scaling dimension @xmath45 effectively , which is consistent with the rg eq .",
    "of @xmath32 ( 2.10 ) .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( 2.10 ) is @xmath46 where we use @xmath47 .",
    "finally we obtain the accurate finite size scaling : @xmath48 moreover we can discuss the thermodynamics properties .",
    "we replace @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the ground state energy of eq .",
    "( 2.15 ) , where @xmath51 is the free energy per temperature .",
    "we obtain the low temperature behaviors of @xmath51 : @xmath52 thus the specific heat @xmath53 is @xmath54",
    "we have investigated the properties of the energy scaling and derived the corrections terms caused by the lr forward scatterings .",
    "let us consider the following tight - binding hamiltonian with lr interactions : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "and we impose the periodic boundary condition and @xmath58 . by the straight forward bosonization technique , the effective action of ( 3.1 ) for the arbitrary filling",
    "can be written by @xmath59 the last oscillating term consists of the umklapp process term @xmath60 and the longer range interactions .",
    "we have found the corrections in eqs .",
    "( 2.15 ) caused by the irrelevant lr forward scatterings ( @xmath11 and @xmath31 odd integer ) in the previous section .",
    "however the oscillating terms may disturb the tll and cause the mass gap .",
    "we numerically investigate how long range the tll phase survive for the strength of the lr interactions . by making use of eqs .",
    "( 2.15 ) , we can calculate the compressibility @xmath61 and the drude weight @xmath62 within the tll framework .",
    "the operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 have the scaling dimensions @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the tll .",
    "the operators have the symmetries @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively .",
    "the explicit excitations describing the compressibility and the drude weight are @xmath69 in fig . 1 and 2 we plot the compressibility @xmath70 and the drude weight @xmath62 versus the interactions strength @xmath32 for the various powers @xmath3 . for @xmath71",
    "the @xmath70 exhibits the rapid increase which suggests the phase separation . in spin variables language of ( 3.1 ) , that is , xxz model , this phase separation is nothing but the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "hence for the larger @xmath3 the point of the phase separation approaches to @xmath72 . for @xmath73 we see the subtle tendency that the @xmath70 become smaller as the @xmath3 is smaller . for the drude weight of @xmath73",
    "we find that the d become larger as the @xmath3 approach to the coulomb interactions case @xmath74 .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the velocity versus the interactions strength @xmath32 for the various powers @xmath3 .",
    "the velocity is defined by @xmath75 note that the velocities are finite values for @xmath11 on the contrary of the coulomb interactions case @xmath74 ( see appendix b 2 . ) .",
    "there are the points where the velocities are zero , implying the existences of the phase separation .    in fig .",
    "4 we plot the normalization @xmath76 versus the interactions strength @xmath32 for the various powers @xmath3 , where @xmath77 , @xmath70 and @xmath78 are defined by eqs . ( 3.3 ) and eq .",
    "( 3.4 ) respectively .",
    "if the system belongs to tll , this value is expected to be 1 .",
    "we see that the tll region become wider as the @xmath3 approaches to @xmath4 for @xmath79 .",
    "reversely for @xmath80 the tll region is smaller as @xmath3 goes to @xmath4 .",
    "we have investigated the range of the tll theoretically and numerically by utilizing the scaling argument of renormalization group and cft . we have found that the tll region become wider and the drude weight become larger as the power @xmath3 approaches to 1 which is the coulomb case .",
    "it was found experimentally@xcite that the amplitude of the persistent current in the micron - size au loops is larger than a predicted value@xcite .",
    "recently it has been found by the self harmonic approximation treatments that the localization length in the sine - gordon model with randomness become larger when the coulomb interactions are considered@xcite .",
    "the our present results seem to give the additional confirmations to these features .",
    "we have found that the tll is broken for the stronger lr interactions .",
    "we expect that the system is gapful for stronger @xmath32 and the ground state become two fold degenerate independently of @xmath81 .",
    "et al _ derived the necessary conditions for the gap generations in the fermion systems of one dimension with nonperturbative arguments @xcite : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the period of ground state and @xmath84 is the density of the fermion . hence @xmath85 is derived for @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "this is reasonable , because the lr interactions include the short range umklapp process term @xmath60 which cause the mass gap and 2 fold degeneracy of the system .",
    "let us argue the case @xmath1 .",
    "assuming the g term is the small perturbation , we obtain the energy size scaling ( see appendix b and appendix c. ) : @xmath88 where we assume @xmath89 ( see appendix b. ) .",
    "we should interpret that the velocity @xmath90 is for no perturbations . according to these results ,",
    "the g terms break the tll behaviors @xmath91 for @xmath92 .",
    "this estimation is consistent with a numerical report that tll is broken by the coulomb interactions@xcite .    through the replacements same as @xmath11 case",
    ", we obtain the temperature dependences of the free energy and specific heat : @xmath93 and @xmath94 where const .",
    "is the positive constant ( see the negative c term of eqs .",
    "( c9 ) in appendix c. ) .",
    "these suggest that the tll is broken even for the slight @xmath32 when t is near to 0 because @xmath95 become larger than @xmath96 .",
    "when @xmath97 , even for small @xmath32 , the system belongs to other universality class in which the density correlation function is given by ( 2.5 ) .",
    "however we can justify that the tll holds if @xmath98 . ] because the @xmath99 is smaller than @xmath96 . for this case",
    "it is convincing that the @xmath100 terms are the small perturbations .",
    "therefore we can have the pictures for the case @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "8 . ) .    in summary , by utilizing the bosonization technique , the renormalization group and the cft we analyzed the tll with lr forward scatterings .",
    "and we could obtain the accurate finite size scaling of the energies and thermodynamics properties . by making use of these scaling relations and the numerical calculations we found that the range of tll and the drude weight increase as the interactions power @xmath3 approaches to 1 which is the coulomb interactions one .",
    "furthermore we obtained the specific heat for @xmath1 , which deviates from the linear @xmath96 to t+g@xmath101 , where the small @xmath32 takes the positive value if the lr interactions are repulsive .",
    "this implys the tll holds when @xmath98 .",
    "i thank k. nomura for his encourages .",
    "the numerical calculations in this work is based on the package titpack ver . 2.0 by h. nishimori .",
    "the fourier form of the interaction @xmath22 is given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the modified bessel function of @xmath104th order and @xmath105 is the gamma function .",
    "when @xmath74 , @xmath106 which was already discussed by schulz @xcite . when @xmath2 and @xmath107 odd integer , @xmath108 when @xmath3 is odd integer , the @xmath21 is shown in the main part of the present paper .",
    "we derive the renormalization group equations heuristically .",
    "let us start from the action ( 2.9 ) : @xmath109 the partition function is @xmath110 thus we can integrate out @xmath111 ( @xmath112 component ) simply and obtain @xmath113 the remaining procedure of the renormalization is the scale transformation @xmath114 where we choose the dynamical exponent 1 .",
    "the results are @xmath115 where we use the behavior @xmath116 from ( 2.4 ) .",
    "hence we obtain the renormalization group eq .",
    "@xmath117 we put @xmath118 and obtain eq .",
    "10 ) .",
    "the dispersion relations of the coulomb interactions case include the marginal part @xmath27 and @xmath119 as well as the @xmath11 case .",
    "however it is difficult to know the explicit separated function like eqs .",
    "( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) .",
    "therefore we renormalize by using the bare @xmath120 .    integrating out the fast part",
    ", we obtain the effective action of the slow part @xmath121 where we dare to leave the velocity in the gaussian part .",
    "note that we need not the renormalization of the velocity in the case @xmath11 .",
    "after the scale transformation ( b 4 ) , we obtain the eqs .",
    "@xmath122 we see that the @xmath17 and the velocity @xmath78 is renormalized in stead of the no renormalization of g. the velocity v can be written by @xmath123 the velocity shows the weak divergence for long distances , which is consistent with the estimations of @xmath124 from the eqs .",
    "( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) .",
    "we write the hamiltonian in the finite strip from the action ( 2.1 ) : @xmath125 where the @xmath126 is the tll part of the hamiltonian .",
    "we introduce the step function @xmath127 to avoid the ultra violet divergences which come from @xmath22 and the operator product expansion of @xmath128 . for the small perturbation @xmath32 the ground state energy @xmath129 varies as @xmath130_{\\tau_{1}=\\tau_{2}=0 } \\theta(|\\sigma_{1}-\\sigma_{2}|-\\alpha_{0}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduce the coordination @xmath131 ( @xmath132 , @xmath133 ) . from the characters of the gaussian part ( tll part ) we can separate as @xmath134 and derive @xmath135 .",

    "@xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) have the spin @xmath144 and conformal dimension @xmath145(@xmath146 ) .",
    "hence we obtain @xmath147 where we impose the periodic boundary condition and use the interaction potential @xmath148 .",

    "the form of b and c terms is just same as the second term of eqs .",
    "we assume that these terms should be renormalized to tll , because the lr interactions inevitably contain the short range types of interactions which are reduced to @xmath154 .",
    "it is natural and reasonable that in the corrections of the ground state energy there are the same contributions as the tll forms of ( 2.11 ) .",

    "we think that this is caused by the lr interactions which include the short range interactions .",
    "the short interactions is nothing but the part of tll .",

    "( c10 ) there is an ambiguity whether the @xmath160 commute with the integrals .",
