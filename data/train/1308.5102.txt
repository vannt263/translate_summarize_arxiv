    "<S> the methods presented can directly be scaled up to generate graph states of several tens of qubits .    </S>",
    "<S> the circuit model of quantum computation is conceptually similar to a classical computer : a register of two - level systems in a simple initial product state are manipulated using unitary quantum logic gates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mbqc @xcite represents a conceptually and practically different approach : after preparing an entangled cluster state of qubits @xcite , computation proceeds by performing measurements and feedforward . both approaches present different theoretical and practical challenges to realisation and warrant investigation in parallel .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , researchers have found novel applications for mbqc beyond universal qc , including e.g. blind quantum computation @xcite measurement - based entanglement purification @xcite and quantum error correction @xcite , featuring very high thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the two - stage process of mbqc  resource creation followed by its processing  resources states can be purified and manipulated beforehand . </S>",
    "<S> this offers a large degree of flexibility in optimizing and compressing schemes for quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> schemes for correcting errors in universal mbqc have also been found with extremely high tolerence to errors , compared to those known for the circuit model of qc @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> important experimental progress on mbqc has been made using entangled states of up to 8 photonic qubits @xcite . scaling up the non - deterministic methods used to generate entangled states in these works is very challenging , since their success probably reduces exponentially in photon number . </S>",
    "<S> very recently there has been work on generating cluster states in continuous variables of light fields @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we present the first demonstration of mbqc using trapped ions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we make two experimental steps forward in the model of mbqc that are system - independent : the deterministic generation of cluster states and the demonstration of quantum error correction ( qec ) . </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organised as follows ; firstly mbqc is briefly reviewed and our approach to preparing cluster states is summarised ; then a universal set of operations is presented using a 4 qubit cluster state ; finally the phase - flip correction code is demonstrated for increasing codeword lengths . </S>",
    "<S> we do not implement active feedforward , which has previously been demonstrated with trapped ions @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the graph state @xmath11 is then uniquely defined as the common eigenstate of all operators @xmath12 with eigenvalue @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> one approach to generating graph states is to start from an initial state with all qubits in @xmath14 , i.e. the + 1 eigenstate of @xmath8 , and then apply a controlled phase ( cp ) gate @xcite between every pair of qubits connected by an edge .    </S>",
    "<S> an important graph state is the 2d cluster state @xmath15 @xcite , which has the topology of a square lattice and belongs to the class of universal resource states @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> any quantum logic circuit can be translated to a single - qubit - measurement pattern on @xmath15 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> measurements in the computational basis can be used to remove qubits from the cluster and imprint any desired quantum circuit structure onto the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> measurements in the basis @xmath16 , where @xmath17 with real @xmath18 , drive the computation . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath18 determines , for example , the angle of single - qubit rotations . in general @xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> has to be adapted to the outcomes of previous measurements and thus introduces a temporal order and the need for feedforward @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> while the use of the state @xmath15 offers a canonical route to quantum circuit simulation , the conceptual framework of mbqc is much more flexible and offers different and more economic modes of operation . instead of starting with @xmath15 , for example </S>",

    "<S> such a situation arises for example in qec , which will be described below . </S>",
    "<S> concatenating such tailored resource states in measurement - based qec and entanglement purification can give rise to much higher thresholds @xcite    experiments use strings of @xmath19ca@xmath20 ions in a linear paul trap , manipulated with lasers . </S>",

    "<S> we now briefly summarise how graph states are generated , for more details see the supplementary material . </S>",
    "<S> experiments begin by preparing @xmath23 ionic - qubits in the product state @xmath24 via optical pumping , and preparing the axial centre - of - mass ( com ) and stretch ( str ) vibrational modes in the ground state by resolved sideband cooling . </S>",

    "<S> firstly an effective long - range qubit - qubit interaction of the form @xmath25 can be turned on for arbitrary times . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction is realised by off - resonantly driving the axial com vibrational mode of the ion string using a bichromatic laser field from a single direction @xcite . when applied to ionic - qubits in @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> this periodically generates fully connected graph states that are equivalent to ghz states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second and third tools both allow the selective removal of any connection in the graph @xcite . both use laser pulses tightly focused on individual ions . in combination these three tools allow , in principle , </S>",
    "<S> any cluster state to be deterministically created .    in the circuit model of qc a universal set of logic gates </S>",
    "<S> provides the tools to implement arbitrary quantum algorithms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a common universal gate set consists of the cp gate and arbitrary single - qubit rotations around two independent axes , e.g. the z axis , @xmath26 and the x axis , @xmath27 , by angle @xmath18 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all of these gates can be translated to carrying out specific sequences of measurements and feedforward on a four qubit linear cluster state @xmath28 , which are presented in figures 1a and 2a @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> realising measurement patterns like these on large - scale cluster states , when combined with qec , enables arbitrary mbqc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we create @xmath28 using a laser pulse sequence lasting 300@xmath29s and reconstruct the full density matrix via quantum state tomography ( see supplementary material for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observed fidelity with the ideal state is @xmath30 , which is well above the threshold for multipartite entanglement of 0.5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> measurement of @xmath28 in the order presented in figure 1 is equivalent to a circuit performing a sequence of one - qubit gates on the encoded state @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the choice of measurement basis of qubits 1,2 and 3 [ @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 determines the overall rotation applied to @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we implement a range of measurement combinations , each demonstrating a different one - qubit rotation . </S>",
    "<S> one approach , which avoids the need for active feedforward , is to reconstruct the output state ( encoded in qubit @xmath34 ) post - selected on the cases where the @xmath13 outcomes of the measurement of qubits 1 , 2 and 3 are observed , as in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more information is obtained if all outcomes are kept and post - processed to simulate perfect feedforward . </S>",
    "<S> results obtained in this way provide an upper limit for the performance that could have been achieved using feedforward . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 presents the results on the bloch sphere : a range of different rotated output states , reconstructed via quantum state tomography . </S>",
    "<S> the average output state fidelity with the ideal case is @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> measurement of @xmath28 in the order presented in figure 2 is equivalent to a circuit composed of a cp gate and one - qubit rotations , which operates on the encoded state @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the choice of measurement basis of qubits 1 and 4 determine the one - qubit rotations . </S>",
    "<S> the output state is stored in qubits 2 and 3 . </S>",
    "<S> we choose two important cases : a maximally entangled state ( case 1 ) and a product state ( case 2 ) are ideally created . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify the generated entanglement by the tangle @xmath37 @xcite . in case 1 </S>",
    "<S> we find that the experimentally reconstructed state is strongly entangled , @xmath38 , and has a fidelity of @xmath39 with the ideal state . in case 2 </S>",
    "<S> the experimental state is close to being separable , @xmath40 , and has a fidelity of @xmath41 with the ideal state . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally reconstructed two - qubit output density matrices are presented in figure 2 . taken together , </S>",
    "<S> the results in figures 1 and 2 demonstrate a universal set of operations .    </S>",
    "<S> we also created the 4-qubit box cluster state @xmath42 , an example of a ring cluster @xcite and the smallest intrinsically 2d cluster state . </S>",
    "<S> we tomographically reconstructed the full density matrix and observed a fidelity of @xmath43 with the ideal state . for more details </S>",
    "<S> see supplementary material .    in a realistic setup one can not decouple the qubits on which the computation is performed completely from the environment , which will introduce errors on the qubits . </S>",
    "<S> qec codes @xcite provide a solution by encoding the states @xmath44 and @xmath45 of a qubit into the states of larger physical systems @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( called codewords or logical qubits ) and using correlations to protect the information . </S>",
    "<S> qec consists of at least two steps after the encoding . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , one measures the correlation operators which reveal the error syndrome . in this step errors , which might be unitary qubit rotations or involve entangling to the environment , </S>",
    "<S> are discretized . </S>",
    "<S> the discretization of the errors is a crucial step , as it reduces the infinite set of possible quantum errors to a finite set . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , one applies the recovery operator to undo the error . </S>",
    "<S> the principles of qec in the circuit model have been demonstrated before @xcite , including the 3-qubit phase - flip code @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> circuit model qec codes can be translated to mbqc in the same way as algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is important to note that qec codes involve only clifford gates and pauli measurements , which can be implemented in a very compact way in mbqc @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate an mbqc phase - flip code , with codewords @xmath48 and @xmath49 , capable of correcting full phase flips ( z ) on up to @xmath50 of the codeword qubits . the general form of the graph state employed , labelled @xmath51 , and the protocol are presented in figure 3 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 consists of @xmath52 qubits : @xmath23 for the codeword , labelled @xmath53 to @xmath54 , and two additional qubits @xmath55 and @xmath56 to read in ( encode ) and read out the initial and final protected 1-qubit state , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> for arbitrary @xmath23 , @xmath57 after preparation of @xmath51 , the protocol proceeds as follows : 1 . </S>",
    "<S> a 1-qubit state @xmath58 or the orthogonal state is encoded by measuring qubit a in a basis where these are the eigenstates . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is to distribute either state non - locally amongst the remaining @xmath59-qubits . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> each of the @xmath23 central qubits @xmath54 is measured in the x basis , yielding one of @xmath60 possible outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> this simultaneously decodes the state and reveals which of up to @xmath50 errors have occurred on the central qubits ( i.e. determines the error syndrome ) . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> a 1-qubit correction operation , determined by the outcome in 2 is applied to the output state , stored in qubit @xmath56 , recovering the encoded 1-qubit state .    </S>",
    "<S> the temporal order of the measurements is unimportant and errors can happen to the central qubits , @xmath53 to @xmath54 , at any time before measurement of these central qubits . </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to interpret the protocol as attempting to teleport a state across the cluster , from a to b , through a noisy channel affecting the middle qubits .    </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the protocol using the @xmath611 , 3 and 5 cases shown in figure 4.a - c . </S>",
    "<S> equivalent experimental investigations of increasing codeword lengths in the circuit model have not yet been realised , due to the complexity of the gate sequences required . </S>",
    "<S> the laser - pulse sequences used to generate each graph are described in the supplementary material . for the @xmath62 and 3 cases </S>",
    "<S> we reconstruct the full @xmath63-qubit density matrices via quantum state tomography , yielding state fidelities of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the codes are tested against errors realised by applying 1-qubit rotations @xmath66 to all or a subset of the codeword qubits @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> after measurement of @xmath54 ( and therefore discretisation of the errors ) this is equivalent to independent phase flips occurring incoherently and independently on those qubits to which it is applied , with probability @xmath67 . for input states we choose to encode the four eigenstates of the pauli x and y operators , which are maximally affected by phase flip errors . </S>",
    "<S> error correction performance is quantified by the average teleportation state fidelity ( atf ) , through the noisy channel , averaged over the four input states .    </S>",
    "<S> firstly each code is tested against errors applied to one codeword qubit ( @xmath53 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath61 3 and 5 graphs should be robust to this , whilst the atf for the @xmath61 1 graph should reduce linearly with @xmath68 , since it provides no error correction . </S>",
    "<S> the results , presented in figure 4 , show quantitative agreement with the ideal cases , up to deviations that largely correspond to an overall fidelity drop due to imperfections in the graph state preparation . </S>",
    "<S> also shown is the resistance against two errors ( @xmath53 & @xmath69 ) for the @xmath70 case , afforded by the increased codeword length . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasise the quality of the results : even in the presence of large amount of noise we are able to teleport states across a 7 ionic - qubit string with fidelities of over 0.8 .    </S>",
    "<S> these diagnostic tests show that the experimentally generated graph states respond correctly to errors applied to individual codeword qubits . </S>",
    "<S> a more realistic situation is that _ all _ codeword qubits are subject to error with the same probability . </S>",
    "<S> figure 5d shows the theoretical performance of the ideal graphs against such noise : for @xmath71 , graphs with larger @xmath23 perform better , tending towards perfect correction up to @xmath72 as @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a challenging experiment since the small improvement offered by the larger ideal graphs is mitigated by the reduced quality with which the larger graphs were generated .    </S>",
    "<S> errors are applied to all physical codeword qubits in the experimentally generated graph states and the results are presented in figure 5e . </S>",
    "<S> qualitative agreement with the ideal case is observed . even though many more qubits are exposed to errors in the larger codewords , </S>",
    "<S> there is still a region where they perform better . </S>",
    "<S> that is we are able to demonstrate that , for a range of noise levels , a better protection of quantum information is provided when using a larger error correction code . for more discussion see supplementary material .    </S>",
    "<S> table [ stats ] summarises important properties of all experimentally generated graph states . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in @xcite , any ideal graph state violates a multipartite bell - type inequality , i.e. it can not be described by a local hidden variable model . by measuring the expectation value of the multipartite bell observable @xmath74 , described in the supplementary material , we find a clear violation of the corresponding inequality for all prepared graph states . </S>",
    "<S> these results imply that the information processing shown in the experiment is intrinsically quantum , and can not be described by a local hidden variable model . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath74 is equal to the state fidelity , but requires only a small fraction of the number of measurements for state tomography . </S>",
    "<S> our largest error sources , which limit graph state quality , are laser intensity fluctuations and random electric fields that heat the ion string .    using ionic - qubits we have made several distinct steps forward in mbqc : the deterministic generation of graph states , together with their application as resources ; the demonstration of measurement - based quantum error correction and ; the observation of improved performance with increasing codeword length </S>",
    "<S> . it should be possible to directly scale - up the presented techniques to generate cluster states of several tens of qubits in the next few years . </S>",
    "<S> more efficient schemes for generating ionic cluster states might employ direct nearest - neighbour interactions , such as those afforded by multi - site ion traps @xcite . both the circuit and measurement - based models of qc </S>",

    "<S> experimentally we find that these states have an imperfect fidelity due to the imperfect preparation of the graph - states . </S>",
    "<S> these additional states do not probe the error correction capability of the graphs .    </S>",
    "<S> the conclusion that we draw from figure [ all6_local ] is the same as in the main text : the graphs respond correctly to errors applied to specific codeword qubits ( @xmath54 ) and the larger graphs are able to cope with errors on multiple qubits . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusion that we draw from figure [ all6_global ] is also unchanged : there is a region where the larger codewords perform better , in spite of the increased complexity of their generation . </S>",
    "<S> the size of this region is smaller when including all 6 states .    </S>",
    "<S> figures 4 and 5 in the the main text show deviations from the ideal cases . </S>",
    "<S> we looked into this is in detail and now report on two observations , which are described below .    </S>",
    "<S> firstly , since full density matrices of the @xmath62 and @xmath84 graph states were measured , these can be used to simulate the outcome of the error correction tests that we performed . </S>",
    "<S> specifically the entire error correction protocol , including the addition of errors , can be straightforwardly carried out by appropriately rotating and projecting the reconstructed density matrices . </S>",
    "<S> the results calculated in this way are presented in figure [ err_rho ] c and compared to the results that are presented in the main text . </S>",
    "<S> the different approaches show a close agreement . from this </S>",
    "<S> we can conclude that the main sources of deviation between experiment and ideal theory are due to the errors in the experimentally generated graph states themselves , rather than mistakes in the way we precisely apply errors .    </S>",
    "<S> the high fidelity of the reconstructed states reflects the small errors they contain . </S>",
    "<S> error budgets for two ionic - qubit logic gates have been given before @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specific and detailed experiments will have to be design to determine the extent of potential noise sources in multi - qubit operations . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is clear that contributing error sources are laser intensity fluctuations and random electric fields that lead to am incoherent heating rate of the ion string common vibrational modes . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a heating rate of approximately 50 phonons per second , of the axial com at 1.2  mhz .     for @xmath61 1 and 3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> rotations ( errors ) @xmath85 are applied to all central qubits ( in blue ) , which after measurement are projected into independent z flip errors with probability @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> * c * performance calculated from experimentally reconstructed density matrices of the state in a ) solid blue line and b ) solid red line . * </S>",
    "<S> d * experimental results by directly measuring the states in a ) blue diamonds and b ) red squares directly . ]    </S>",
    "<S> secondly , it was surprising to us that the average teleportation fidelity for the @xmath87 state , at @xmath88 , is not significantly lower than for the smaller states : this larger 7-qubit state is certainly experimentally more challenging to generate . </S>",
    "<S> we looked into the effect of adding various types of noise to the ideal graph states on the teleportation fidelity at @xmath88 ( i.e. without additional @xmath9 errors ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the larger states are more robust to various types of noise , such as depolarisation . </S>",
    "<S> this may be understood by considering that any component of noise that leads to @xmath9 errors is better protected by the larger states . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , one should expect that any part of the experimental noise , introduced in our graph - state generation process , that is equivalent to @xmath9 errors on the ideal state is better corrected by the error correction protocol for the larger states . </S>"
