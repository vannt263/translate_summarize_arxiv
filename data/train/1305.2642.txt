    "ds - uwb systems have been considered as a potential standard physical layer technology for wireless personal area networks ( wpans ) @xcite .    in multiuser ds - uwb systems ,",
    "the receiver is required to effectively suppress the multiple - access interference ( mai ) which is caused by the multiuser communication and the inter - symbol interference ( isi ) which is caused by the multipath channel . in uwb systems ,",
    "the huge transmission bandwidths introduce a high degree of diversity at the receiver due to a large number of resolvable multipath components ( mpcs ) @xcite . in order to operate in dense multipath environments with low complexity , single - carrier frequency domain equalization ( sc - fde ) systems with a cyclic prefix",
    "have been recently applied to ds - uwb communications @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "frequency domain minimum mean - square error ( mmse ) turbo equalization scheme is proposed for single - user ds - uwb systems . for multiuser communications , the frequency domain detector is obtained by combining the turbo equalizer with a soft interference canceller . in @xcite , the performance of the linear mmse detector in sc - fde and orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing ( ofdm ) systems",
    "are compared over uwb channels and the simulation results show that the sc - fde system is reasonably robust in the presents of carrier frequency offset and sampling time offset . in @xcite ,",
    "a low - complexity channel estimation algorithm is proposed for single user communication .",
    "a new sc block transmission structure was proposed in @xcite , where a novel despreading scheme was employed in the frequency domain before channel estimation and equalization . in @xcite-@xcite , frequency - domain linear multiuser detection and channel estimation",
    "was performed and a linear mmse equalization scheme was described . however , in @xcite-@xcite , @xmath0 knowledge of the channel and the received signal is required and the parameter estimation problem was not considered in detail .",
    "adaptive techniques are effective tools for estimating parameters and are able to deal with channel variations @xcite . in the frequency domain ,",
    "adaptive algorithms are usually more stable and converge faster than in the time domain @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", these techniques have not been thoroughly investigated for uwb communications yet . in this work , adaptive algorithms based on lms , rls and cg techniques",

    "after the frequency domain processing , the despreading is performed in the time domain to eliminate the mai .",
    "the lms and rls adaptive algorithms for the sce with single user sc systems were proposed in @xcite and in this work we extend them to multiuser scenarios . however , the sce - rls has very high complexity because there is an inversion of matrix that must be computed directly @xcite .",

    "it is important to note that with the traditional signal expression for the multiuser block transmission systems , the da scheme requires a matrix - structured adaptive filter in the frequency domain which leads to prohibitive complex solutions . in the literature ,",
    "the adaptive da scheme in multiuser uwb systems has not been investigated in detail .",
    "prior work on adaptive frequency domain algorithms is limited to single - user systems @xcite and do not exploit the structure created by multiuser uwb systems with a cyclic prefix . in order to obtain a simplified filter design , we adopt the signal expression described in @xcite and extend it into an adaptive parameter estimation implementation . after obtaining the matrix form of the mmse design of such a filter ,",
    "we convert it into a vector form and develop lms , rls and cg algorithms in the frequency domain that enables the linear suppression of isi and mai . in our proposed da scheme , a low complexity rls algorithm , termed da - rls , is obtained with the new signal expression .",
    "the proposed da - rls algorithm is suitable for multiuser block transmission systems . with faster convergence rate than the da - lms and da - cg ,",
    "the complexity of the da - rls in the multiuser cases is comparable to the da - cg . in the single user scenario , the complexity of the da - rls",
    "is reduced to the level of the da - lms .",

    "for both schemes , the lms , rls and cg algorithms are developed .",
    "* in the first scheme , named sce , adaptive algorithms are developed for estimating the channel coefficients and algorithms for computing the noise variance and the number of active users are also proposed .",
    "* in the second scheme , named da , a new signal model is adopted to enable simplified adaptive implementation .",
