    "diffusive lattice gases describe simple classical transport models @xcite . besides their other applications",
    ", they have been extensively used for studying fluctuations of the density and current far from thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest settings here is a one - dimensional ring which involves a large number of lattice sites @xcite . because of the periodic boundary conditions , the average current through the ring vanishes .",
    "fluctuating currents , however , are non - zero , and it is interesting to find the probability distribution of observing a given current in a certain time interval .",
    "one simplifying hypothesis ( both here and in other , non - ring , settings ) is known under the name of  additivity principle \" .",
    "it assumes that the optimal density profile of the gas , conditional on a given current , is time - independent , leading to gaussian statistics of the current @xcite .",
    "indeed , for not too large currents , the additivity principle was verified in monte - carlo simulations of the kipnis - marchioro - presutti ( kmp ) model on an interval the boundaries of which are kept at different temperatures @xcite .",
    "this model was originally suggested as a microscopic model for which , at a coarse - grained level , the fourier s law of heat conduction can be rigorously proven @xcite .",
    "the model consists of a lattice of agents who carry a continuous amount of energy . at each stochastic",
    "move the energy is redistributed , via the uniform distribution , among a randomly chosen pair of nearest neighbors .",
    "this process conserves the energy locally , and will conserve it globally under appropriate boundary conditions , including those of a ring .",
    "the additivity principle has also been found to hold in several other settings , all dealing with large deviations of current in conservative and non - conservative lattice gases @xcite .",
    "however , already in 2005 it was found that , for some lattice gases on a ring , the additivity principle breaks down when the current exceeds a critical value @xcite .",
    "when this happens , the system undergoes a dynamical phase transition , and the optimal density profile becomes time - dependent .",
    "one lattice gas model that exhibits breakdown of the additivity principle in the ring geometry is the kmp model , and the dynamical phase transition in this model was clearly identified in stochastic simulations @xcite .",
    "a coarse - grained description of diffusive lattice gases , including the kmp model , is provided by a langevin equation @xcite .",
    "in one spatial dimension we have @xmath3 where @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the energy density , @xmath6 is the current density , and @xmath7 is a delta - correlated gaussian noise which satisfies @xmath8 the gas diffusivity @xmath9 and mobility @xmath10 are determined by the microscopic dynamics of the specific model . for the kmp model @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the lattice constant . in the literature ,",
    "a dimensionless description of the transport coefficients is often used , where @xmath14 .    in this work",
    "we will use the macroscopic fluctuation theory ( mft ) : a large - deviation theory for the langevin equation ( [ continuity ] ) and ( [ langevin ] ) .",
    "the mft was originally developed by bertini _",
    "et al_. for studying the non - equilibrium steady states of driven diffusive lattice gases , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "the mft is a weak - noise theory based on a saddle - point evaluation of the exact path integral of the langevin equation .",
    "the mft leads to a variational formulation for the optimal density profile , conditioned on a given large deviation .",
    "a closely related approach is the optimal fluctuation method that goes back to refs .",
    "@xcite , see also ref .",
    "being especially suitable for sufficiently steep distribution tails , similar weak - noise theories have been applied to turbulence @xcite , stochastic reactions @xcite , non - equilibrium surface growth and related models @xcite , and other systems .",
    "the mft equations can be formulated as a classical hamiltonian field theory .",
    "having solved the mft equations , one can evaluate the action functional , from which the probability to observe a specific large deviation is obtained up to a sub - leading pre - factor .",
    "bodineau and derrida @xcite showed that , for currents larger than the critical current , the optimal density profile , conditioned on the given current , corresponds to a traveling wave ( tw ) solution of the mft equations .",
    "they found an implicit tw solution , in the form of a first - order ordinary differential equation , with two integral constraints , for a general lattice gas on a one - dimensional ring @xcite .",
    "hurtado and garrido @xcite performed monte - carlo simulations of the kmp model on a ring . as they observed , ",
    "... for currents above a critical threshold the system self - organizes into a coherent traveling wave which facilitates the current deviation by gathering energy in a localized packet , thus breaking translation invariance \" @xcite .",
    "hurtado and garrido @xcite also found the tw solution numerically .",
    "meerson and sasorov @xcite studied the large - current statistics of the kmp model on an infinite interval with a step - like density at @xmath15 .",
    "they found that the optimal time history of a very large current fluctuation has the form of a ( slowly evolving ) soliton - like pulse , while the probability of a large current obeys a sub - gaussian statistics of the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a rescaled current .",
    "building on these works , here we study in detail the tw solution to the mft equations for the kmp model on a ring : for all currents , including arbitrary large ones .",
    "we find the tw solution and the resulting probability analytically .",
    "our equation for the density profile coincides with the equation obtained by bodineau and derrida @xcite , and we solve it explicitly for the kmp model .",
    "we obtain simple asymptotics of the density profile and action close to the phase transition and in the limit of large currents . in the former limit ,",
    "the results of bodineau and derrida are reproduced and extended to higher orders . in the latter limit ,",
    "we observe a similar ( but simpler ) behavior of the solution compared with the one derived by meerson and sasorov @xcite for the infinitely long system .",
