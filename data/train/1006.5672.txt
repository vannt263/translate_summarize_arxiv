    "chern - simons ( cs ) theory  @xcite is an important theoretical framework which has been used to study many issues on quantum field theory in three space - time dimensions . among the interesting properties of cs theory",
    "are the classical conformal invariance and the fact that the gauge field does not receive infinite renormalization , leading to a zero beta function for the gauge coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "these are important aspects for the problem of symmetry breaking through radiative corrections  @xcite , which we want to revisit in this work considering a cs theory coupled to matter .",
    "our study is motivated by some recent developments concerning the summation of the power series in the leading and subleading logarithm terms of the effective potential by means of the renormalization group equation ( rge )  @xcite .",
    "the rge allows one to obtain extra information from the usual loop approximation , thus providing more refined information concerning quantum properties of the model under scrutiny .",
    "an important example where the rge have dramatically improved the information obtained in the loop approximation is in the analysis of the effective potential for the standard model with conformal invariance : from the standard one - loop approximation , the effective action of the model does not seems to be stable , but with the more precise approximation obtained using the rge , one discover it actually is  @xcite . for other examples see  @xcite .",
    "we show here an improved calculation of the effective potential of the theory of a cs field coupled to scalar and fermionic fields .",
    "the computation includes infinite summations of terms of the effective potential which can be carried out with the rge and the knowledge of the elements figuring in it : the beta functions , scalar field anomalous dimension and the first logarithm corrections for the effective potential .",
    "these elements at lowest approximation need a two - loop calculation to be determined since there are no one - loop divergences in odd space - time dimensions when using the sort of regularization we adopt here ( regularization by dimensional reduction ) .",
    "in fact all one particle irreducible diagrams with an odd number of loops will be finite under this scheme .",
    "some of the needed elements were computed in refs  @xcite ; in this work , we calculate the fermion anomalous dimension and the beta function for the yukawa coupling .",
    "a peculiarity of cs theory has to be mentioned at this point .",
    "the theory involves the levi - civita tensor which can not be easily extended to arbitrary dimensions as needed in the context of dimensional regularization .",
    "a regularization procedure called dimensional reduction@xcite has been shown to be appropriated in dealing with cs theory  @xcite : essentially , it consists in performing the tensor and gamma matrices algebra in three dimensions , and extending only the momentum integrals to arbitrary dimensions .    the two - loop results , in conjunction with the rge ,",
    "allows us to sum up all terms in the effective potential where the total power of the coupling constants is one and two units larger than the power of the logarithms @xmath0 ( called _ leading logarithms _ , ll , and _ next - to - leading logarithms _ , nll , terms ) , as well as some subseries where they are three units larger ( the _ next - to - next - to - leading logarithms _",
    "we study the dynamical symmetry breaking of the conformal symmetry in this theory , showing that the improved effective potential leads to a much finer determination of the properties in the broken phase , such as mass and coupling constant of the scalar field .",
    "this happens because the region of the parameter space of the theory , where the dynamical breaking of symmetry is operational at the perturbative level , is much smaller when considering the improved effective potential than for the initial two - loop potential .",
    "another interesting aspect is that , for certain values of the parameters , we found two broken vacua , which leads to different physical properties .",
    "this happens both for the improved and the original effective potential , but the region of the parameter space where this happens is much more restricted for the former case .",
    "again , the improvement of the perturbative effective potential calculation provides more precise determination of the properties of the theory .",
    "we believe that the outcomes of our analysis involving the chern - simons theory enforces the idea that one has to extract the maximum amount of information from a given perturbative calculation , by using the renormalization group equations to obtain a better approximation to the effective potential . even if its natural at a first moment to use one - loop results to predict masses and coupling constants from any of the many proposed extensions to the standard model , for example , one should enrich the analysis of the dynamical symmetry breaking by means of the rge .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the method of using the rge to sum up series of perturbative corrections to the effective potential is outlined in sec.[sec : general - considerations ] .",
    "the model we shall study is described in sec.[sec : the - model ] .",
    "technical details of the two - loop calculations needed for this work are presented in sec.[sec : appa ] .",
    "sec.[sec : appb ] contains the detailed calculation of the improved effective potential , which is used to study the dynamical breaking of the conformal symmetry in sec.[sec : dynamical - breaking ] .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarized in sec.[sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we start by reviewing the use of the rge to calculate the improved effective potential .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , the standard practice for solving the rge by replacing the couplings in the effective potential by their running values amounts to a particular application of the method of characteristics to solve partial differential equations .",
    "this procedure does not exhaust , however , the information that is contained in the rge : actually , a finer approximation can be obtaining by writing the effective potential as a general power series in the couplings and logarithms of the scalar field , and using the rge to sum up some infinite subsets of this power series .    to explain the general procedure , we will consider a general model of a scalar field @xmath1 with a self - interaction of the form @xmath2 , together with interactions with other dynamical fields .",
    "as known , in three spacetime dimensions , renormalizability imposes that @xmath3 , but we shall not fix any particular value of @xmath4 in this section .",
