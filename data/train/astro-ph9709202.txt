    "a near - infrared survey of galaxies is fundamental for the study of cosmology .",
    "merits of using the near - infrared wavelengths are that the k corrections of galaxies remain small and nearly independent of their morphological type up to @xmath9 ( cowie et al .",
    "1994 ; yoshii & peterson 1995 ) , and that the evolutionary corrections of galaxies are smooth and modeled reliably .",
    "this is because the luminosity of galaxies in the near - infrared is dominated by low mass , late type stars and is less sensitive to bursts of star formation ( yoshii & takahara 1988 ) , and even at large redshift , near - infrared observations of galaxies measure their flux in well - known optical wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , the dust extinction in the near - infrared is much smaller than in the optical .",
    "the @xmath0-band galaxy number counts have been obtained by a number of authors to a variety of depths in different areas in order to constrain the geometry of the universe ( gardner , cowie , & wainscoat 1993 ; cowie et al .",

    "the bright and faint surveys were carried out during august and september , 1994 , using the australian national university s 2.3 m telescope at siding spring observatory , australia , equipped with the picnic near infrared camera ( kobayashi et al .",
    "1994 ) which was developed at national astronomical observatory , japan .",
    "picnic uses a nicmos3 array ( @xmath14 pixels ) with a field of view of @xmath15 arcmin@xmath12 and with a pixel scale of 0.509 arcsec pixel@xmath16 . in order to reduce the thermal sky background , we used a @xmath3 filter , which has the same transmission curve as the 2mass @xmath17 filter ( mcleod et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the bright survey was centered at @xmath18 ( 2000 ) or @xmath19 .",
    "the observations were made by raster scanning with the telescope .",
    "each scan consisted of eight steps with 100 arcsec offsets ( 30 arcsec overlap ) in right ascension followed by a step with the same 100 arcsec offsets in declination and eight more steps in right ascension in the reverse direction until all 64 positions of an eight by eight grid had been observed by taking a set of exposures at each grid position in the scan .",
    "some scans took eight 17.1 s exposures at each grid position , others took five , depending on the time available to complete the observations .",
    "the scan pattern was observed 7 times to obtain 58 exposures , i.e. , 990 s integration per position .",
    "the faint survey was centered at @xmath20 ( 2000 ) or @xmath21 , within the area of the bright survey .",
    "the telescope was shifted randomly in such a pattern that no positions were closer than 3 arcsec to each other and the positions cover a @xmath22 arcsec@xmath12 box .",
    "the integration time of each exposure was also 17.1 s and eight exposure were taken at each position .",
    "the pattern was observed several times so that 2351 exposures were obtained , corresponding to a total integration time of 40000 s.",
    "the images were reduced using iraf and stsdas .",
    "the raw @xmath3-band images were corrected for thermal scattered light by subtracting a sky - image , and corrected for spatial variations in the detector response by dividing with a flat field - image after subtracting the sky - image .",
    "a further correction was applied to remove residual thermal stray light and residual sky background variations .",
    "the construction of the sky - images , the flat field - images , and the mosaic required two iterations .",
    "the objects detected in the mosaiced image constructed for the first iteration were masked during the construction of the sky - images and flat field - images for the second and final iteration .",
    "the observations for the faint survey and bright survey were made in slightly different manners , and this necessitated slightly different treatments in the reductions .",
    "the faint survey observations were made by taking a series of sequential exposures with the telescope pointing at essentially the same position in the sky , with only small offsets made between every set of eight 17.1 s exposures .",
    "the faint survey field contained two stars that appeared in each exposure and were used to register all of the individual faint survey images .",
    "the bright survey observations were made by raster scanning with the telescope .",
    "each scan consisted of different 64 positions in an eight by eight grid .",
    "eight or five in some scans 17.1 s exposures were taken at each grid position .",
    "the exposures at each grid position from a single scan were median combined to create a position - image . if the individual exposures contained bright objects , then offsets between the different exposures at the same grid position were determined from the bright objects and used to construct the position - image at that grid position .",
    "a scan - image was constructed by median combining the 64 position - images of each scan after registering them against an aat @xmath23-band ccd image in the first iteration , and against the first iteration @xmath3-band mosaiced image in the final iteration . in a few cases ,",
    "a position - image contained no objects suitable for registration , and the relative position in the scan was interpolated from the registered position - images that preceded and followed in the scan sequence . the mosaiced image of the bright survey area was constructed by median combining the seven scan - images after smoothing a few of the scans obtained in better seeing to the characteristic seeing of the survey .",
    "the resultant area of the bright survey , after discarding the under - exposed edges , is 180.8 arcmin@xmath4 and the fwhm of the psf is 1.5 arcsec .",
    "the mosaiced image is shown in figure [ fig1 ] ( plate ? ) .",
    "the images formed by median combining sequential blocks of 100 registered exposures in the faint survey were average combined to construct the image of the faint survey area . after discarding the under - exposed edges ,",
    "the resultant area of the faint survey is 2.21 arcmin@xmath4 and the fwhm of the psf is 1.4 arcsec .",
    "the image is shown in figure [ fig2 ] ( plate ? ) .",
    "the time and spatial variation of the background in the raw @xmath3-band exposures does not represent simply the variation in detector sensitivity , but includes contributions from scattered light , emission from dust particles on the optical surfaces , and ambient thermal emission from the telescope structure . in order to minimize the influence of the time variation of the background",
    ", a sky - image was subtracted from each exposure . for the faint survey , the sky - images were constructed from the median combination of blocks of 100 exposures , and subtracted from each of the 100 exposures making up the block . for the bright survey",
    ", the sky - images were constructed from the median combination of exposures taken at the 4 preceding and 4 following grid positions in the same scan . in the final iteration ,",
    "detected objects were masked and the area they covered was ignored in constructing the median combination .",
    "variations in detector sensitivity were corrected by dividing with a flat field - image after subtracting a sky - image from each exposure . the flat field - image was constructed from a combination of a dome flat and an illumination correction .",
    "a dome flat was obtained for each night by differencing observations of a white screen with the calibration lamp on and off .",
    "the dome flat is free of contamination from ambient thermal emission , but suffers from uneven illumination .",
    "an illumination correction was constructed from sky - images and dark exposures .",
    "the sky - images were corrected for thermal stray light , which changed along the rows , by subtracting a quadratic function of row number .",
    "a dark exposure was made with a cold , opaque shutter in the filter wheel blocking all external radiation , and was subtracted from a stray light corrected sky - image to make a sky flat .",
    "the flat field - image was then obtained by multiplying the dome flat by a sky flat that had been divided by the dome flat and smoothed with a @xmath24 pixel box median filter .",
    "a flat field - image was constructed for each row in each scan of the bright survey , and for each block of 100 exposures in the faint survey .",
    "the effectiveness of the correction for variations in detector sensitivity was confirmed by comparing the flux of a standard star measured on a 6 by 6 grid of positions on the array .",
    "the photometric standard stars were taken from the ukirt faint standard stars ( casali & hawarden 1992 ) and the iris faint standard stars referred to the carter system ( carter & meadows 1995 ) .",
    "the transformation between these two systems is @xmath25 ( leggett , smith , & oswalt 1993 ) .",
    "the colors of observed standard stars were @xmath26 , thus the difference of the two systems is less than 0.01 mag and negligible .",
    "several standard stars were observed at every night , and the accuracy of the airmass correction was @xmath27 mag . similarly to mcleod et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , we detected no color term between the @xmath3 filter and the @xmath0 filter from the observation of the standard stars .",
    "we thus estimate the color term simply using the filter isophotal wavelengths from tokunaga ( 1995 ) ( originally from cohen et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for the @xmath28 and @xmath0 filter ) , and derived the relation , @xmath29 since @xmath30 is typical for nearby galaxies ( gavazzi & trinchieri 1989 ) and @xmath31 is expected for galaxies in the bright survey at @xmath32 ( eisenhardt & lebofsky 1987 ) , the magnitude difference between @xmath3 and @xmath0 was estimated as @xmath33 .",
    "the number count error @xmath34 propagated from @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the slope of galaxy counts . even if we consider an extremely steep slope of @xmath38 at @xmath39 from gardner et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , the difference @xmath33 mag yields a negligible count error of @xmath40 . therefore we will not distinguish between @xmath3 and @xmath0 in the remainder of this paper .",
    "focas ( valdes 1982 ; jarvis & tyson 1981 ) was used for the detection and the photometry of objects .",
    "it convolves an image by a user specified filter , then collects adjacent pixels which are above a user specified threshold from the sky background which is determined simultaneously , and decides that a set of connected pixels , if more than a user specified number of pixels , is an object .",
    "these three detection parameters , the convolution filter , the surface brightness threshold , and the minimum area , were adjusted to maximize the completeness while minimizing false detections by simulations .",
    "we prepared artificial field images with a gaussian random noise field and stellar profiles , then tried to detect the artificial objects and measure their magnitudes using various sets of detection parameters .",
    "a @xmath41 pixel gaussian of @xmath42 pixels was used for the convolution filter , and the area of 5 connected pixels was adopted for the minimum area of object .",
    "the corresponding surface brightness threshold was @xmath43 mag arcsec@xmath44 for the bright survey and @xmath45 mag arcsec@xmath44 for the faint survey .",
    "focas measures four flux parameters such as core , aperture , isophotal , and ` total ' magnitudes .",
    "we chose the focas ` total ' magnitude , which measures the flux within a region obtained by expanding the detection isophote by a factor of two , because it is more stable than other flux parameters .",
    "this is because the photometric corrections of the aperture magnitude become large for nearby bright galaxies , and the apertures of the isophotal magnitude for faint objects are so small that the large fraction of flux is lost with the adopted parameters .",
    "we carried out many simulations to examine the completeness and the photometry .",
    "we added a small number of artificial objects to the resultant mosaiced images in order not to change the number density of objects , then detected the objects and measured their magnitudes with the same focas parameters , and compared their focas ` total ' magnitudes with the input magnitudes if they were recovered .",
    "we repeated this until enough objects were examined .",
    "for the bright survey , both simulated stellar profiles and galaxy profiles were considered in the simulations .",
    "the model psf was used to construct the simulated stellar profiles , and was also used to construct the simulated galaxy profiles by convolving the profiles of the model galaxy with it .",
    "the model psf was constructed by fitting a moffat function to the radial profile of the observational psf which was generated by the average of about twenty bright stars in the resultant mosaiced image .",
    "the model galaxies of different apparent magnitudes were generated by placing a galaxy with some absolute magnitude at different redshifts . to be consistent with the redshift survey of songaila et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , which presented @xmath46 at @xmath47 , the absolute magnitude @xmath48 mag at @xmath49 was determined for a model galaxy which should give an apparent magnitude of @xmath50 at @xmath51 .",
    "we adopted @xmath52 where @xmath53 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 , while other choices of the cosmological parameters have only small difference at redshifts concerned ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the k correction was derived by linearly interpolating and extrapolating the typical near infrared colors of nearby galaxies , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( gavazzi & trinchieri 1989 ) , thus leading to @xmath57 mag at @xmath58 and @xmath59 mag at @xmath60 .",
    "no evolutionary correction was applied .",
    "an exponential disk profile was adopted for the radial distribution of surface brightness of the model galaxies .",
    "the internal extinction was neglected and the inclination was set randomly .",
    "the central surface brightness at @xmath49 was adopted as @xmath61 mag arcsec@xmath44 ( giovanelli et al .",
    "1995 ; data originally from peletier et al .",
    "1994 ; de jong & van der kruit 1994 ) with an uniform dispersion of @xmath62 mag .",
    "the half light radius of the @xmath5 model galaxy was 0.75 arcsec and comparable to the psf .    for the faint survey , only simulated stellar profiles which was constructed from the model psf were considered in the simulations , because galaxies become smaller at fainter magnitude , and furthermore the poisson errors of galaxy counts of the faint survey were so large that the difference of estimated completeness for detecting either stars or galaxies would be negligible .",
    "the model psf was constructed by fitting a moffat function to the radial profile of the observational psf which was generated by the average of two bright stars in the resultant mosaiced image .",
    "five artificial objects consisting of either stellar profiles or galaxy profiles were added to the resultant image of the bright survey for each run of the simulation , and we carried out a total of 1760 runs for the stellar profiles and 2000 runs for the galaxy profiles at @xmath63 .",
    "only one artificial object was added to the resultant image of the faint survey for each run , and we carried out a total of 5000 runs at @xmath64 .",
    "the results of these simulations are presented in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the limiting magnitude with 80% completeness of the bright survey was @xmath65 for simulated galaxy profiles , and @xmath66 for simulated stellar profiles .",
    "this limiting magnitude was @xmath67 for the faint survey .",
    "the number of false detections due to noise was estimated by detecting ` negative ' objects .",
    "the signs of the resultant images were reversed , and then the procedure of detection and photometry was repeated with the same focas parameters except for the detection threshold below the sky , which was adjusted so that the average of the global sky for detection was consistent with that for the ` positive ' detection .",
    "the estimated false detections in the bright survey were very few at the focas ` total ' magnitude of @xmath68 , but they started to contribute towards fainter magnitudes .",
    "only a few false detections were estimated in the faint survey .",
    "stars and galaxies in the bright survey were separated based on two morphological parameters , the fwhm and the ir1 , where the fwhm was measured by gaussian fitting of the radial profile by iraf imexamine task and the ir1 was the intensity weighted first moment radius which was measured by focas .",
    "the bright objects at @xmath39 were easily separated based on the fwhm only .",
    "the objects at @xmath69 were separated on the fwhm  ir1@xmath70fwhm diagram as shown in figure [ fig4 ] . since no clear separation was found for fainter objects , we did not attempt to separate stars and galaxies at @xmath71 . in the inset in this figure",
    ", we also plot the simulated stellar and galaxy profiles at @xmath72 which were used for the completeness and photometry simulations .",
    "it clearly shows that simulated stellar profiles are well confined in the lower - left side of the boundary and separated from simulated galaxy profiles .",
    "no simulated galaxy profiles was miss - classified as stars , and only a few simulated stellar profiles were miss - classified as galaxies .",
    "the distribution in the diagram of simulated stellar profiles seems to be slightly different from that of observed stars , however , the rate of miss - classification from stars to galaxies was estimated as only @xmath73% and negligible compared to the poisson errors of star counts and galaxy counts , even if the boundary was shifted 0.1 pixel smaller in the fwhm .",
    "the distribution in the diagram of simulated galaxy profiles seemed to be somewhat different from that of observed galaxies .",
    "however , the simulated galaxy profiles modeled a typical galaxy and the overall distribution of their morphological parameters was similar to that of the observed galaxies . the difference in distribution contributed by compact galaxies",
    "would just become impressive when the boundary region for the star - galaxy separation was closed - up .",
    "because we found the separation in the plots of the observed objects at @xmath74 , and because the estimated rate of miss - classification from stars to galaxies were negligible , we did not make any corrections for miss - classification of the star - galaxy separation .",
    "the @xmath0-band star counts to @xmath8 obtained from the bright survey are tabulated in table [ tab05 ] . since the brightest star ( @xmath75 ) in the field center of the bright survey was used as a guide for the center , it was not used for the later analysis . in the faint survey",
    ", we did not attempt to separate stars and galaxies except for the two obvious bright stars .    in order to estimate the star counts at @xmath71 and their contribution to the total counts , the sky version 4 ( cohen 1994 , 1995 ) , which is a refinement of the galaxy model for the infrared point source sky originally developed by wainscoat et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , was fitted to the star counts at @xmath74 .",
    "two parameters of the model , the solar displacement @xmath76 and the halo to disk ratio were determined as @xmath77 pc and halo : disk@xmath78 times that of the sky version 1 ( wainscoat et al .",
    "1992 ) by the same procedure as that used by cohen ( 1995 ) .",
    "both values were consistent with those determined by cohen ( 1995 ) , 15.5 pc and about 0.45 times the sky version 1 , based on far - ultraviolet and mid - infrared source counts .",
    "the details will be described in another paper .",
    "the star counts and the fitted model are plotted in figure [ fig5 ] . by extrapolating the fitted model to @xmath71 ,",
    "the contributions of the star counts to the total counts were estimated as about 7% at @xmath79 , and 5% at @xmath5 , which were comparable to the poisson errors of galaxy counts of the bright survey .",
    "therefore we subtracted the predicted star counts from the total counts to derive the galaxy counts at @xmath71 for the bright survey . compared to the poisson errors of galaxy counts of the faint survey , the contributions of star counts were negligible ,",
    "therefore we did not subtract the predicted star counts for the faint survey .",
    "the galaxy counts at @xmath80 from the bright survey were derived as follows : the focas ` total ' magnitudes of objects were corrected to total magnitudes based on the simulations , and the number of galaxies in a specific magnitude range was counted , then the small incompleteness was corrected based on the simulations .",
    "the galaxies at @xmath81 were not separated from stars , therefore their number was estimated by subtracting the predicted star counts from the total counts .",
    "this standard procedure became unsatisfactory at faint - end magnitudes of the bright survey , because systematic biases existed close to detection limit . because the scatter of error in photometry increases rapidly towards fainter magnitudes , and because fainter galaxies are more numerous than brighter galaxies , more faint galaxies are counted in the brighter magnitude bin than bright galaxies are counted in the fainter magnitude bin , then the number counts are altered .",
    "furthermore , faint objects are preferentially brightened by noise to come into detection .    in order to avoid the problem ,",
    "the galaxy counts at @xmath82 from the bright survey were derived as follows ( a similar attempt was made by smail et al .",
    "1995 in optical counts . ) : we first generated the transfer matrix , @xmath83 , each element of which gives the fraction of galaxies with a total magnitude , @xmath84 , that was detected at the focas ` total ' magnitude , @xmath85 , based on the simulations .",
    "we then generated the probability matrix , @xmath86 , each element of which gives the probability that a galaxy detected at the focas ` total ' magnitude , @xmath85 , is a galaxy with the total magnitude , @xmath84 , as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the number of galaxies at the total magnitude , @xmath84 .",
    "the number of stars at a specific focas ` total ' magnitude , @xmath89 , was estimated by multiplying the number of stars at the total magnitude predicted by the star count model , @xmath90 , by the transfer matrix for stellar profiles , @xmath91 , and summing over total magnitudes as @xmath92 the number of galaxies at a specific focas ` total ' magnitude , @xmath93 , was estimated by subtracting the estimated number of stars , @xmath94 , and the number of false detections , @xmath95 , from the total number of objects , @xmath96 , at the specific focas ` total ' magnitude , yielding @xmath97 .",
    "then the number of detected galaxies with a specific total magnitude , @xmath98 , was estimated by multiplying the number of galaxies at the focas ` total ' magnitude , @xmath99 , by the probability matrix for galaxy profiles , @xmath100 , and summing over focas ` total ' magnitudes as @xmath101 we corrected @xmath102 for the incompleteness and finally derived the galaxy count .",
    "the slope index of galaxy counts , @xmath103 , was presumed for the calculation of the probability matrix , @xmath86 , as @xmath104 at @xmath39 , @xmath105 at @xmath106 , and the slope index @xmath107 at @xmath108 was left as a free parameter , because the matrix @xmath86 at the magnitude concerned was dependent almost only on @xmath107 and independent of @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the parameter @xmath107 was then adjusted to a value of @xmath111 to be consistent with the derived slope for which @xmath112 from @xmath113 to @xmath114 or @xmath115 from @xmath113 to @xmath116 . by this procedure , the slope index @xmath107 and therefore the galaxy counts were well determined .",
    "for example , an assumed slope of @xmath117 leads to the derived slope for which @xmath118 from @xmath113 to @xmath114 or @xmath119 from @xmath113 to @xmath116 .",
    "a slope of @xmath120 agrees well with @xmath121 at @xmath108 found by gardner et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .    following the standard procedures ,",
    "the galaxy counts at @xmath122 from the faint survey were corrected for incompleteness and magnitude difference arising from photometry errors , and the galaxy counts at @xmath123 were derived using the probability matrix , @xmath86 .",
    "we assumed @xmath124 at @xmath108 ( gardner et al .",
    "1993 ) for the estimation of the @xmath86 , because the poisson errors of the galaxy counts at @xmath125 were too large to determine a more precise slope of @xmath107 .",
    "since the predicted contribution of star counts was negligible compared to the poisson error of the galaxy counts , the total number of objects except for the two stars was used as the number of galaxies .",
    "the @xmath0-band galaxy counts we obtained are tabulated in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the raw counts of galaxies of the bright survey at @xmath126 and those of the faint survey at @xmath127 are not integers because the predicted star counts were subtracted and the probability matrix , @xmath86 , was used .",
    "the errors given for the counts include only the poisson errors defined as a square root of the raw number of objects and false detections .",
    "the @xmath0-band galaxy counts at @xmath128 are plotted in figure [ fig6 ] , to be compared with other observations .",
    "it should be noted that the faintest points of each surveys are unreliable because their completenesses is small , @xmath129 50% , and large corrections were needed .",
    "we estimated the field to field variations of galaxy counts due to clustering from angular correlation functions .",
    "for an angular correlation function of the power - law form @xmath130 and a circular top - hat window function of angular radius of @xmath131 , the rms variation due to clustering is @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 is the mean number of galaxies . from lidman & peterson ( 1996 )",
    "the angular correlation was @xmath135 for @xmath136 and @xmath137 arcmin , each of which corresponds to @xmath47 where @xmath138 ( gardner 1995b ) and to the area of the bright survey .",
    "then the rms variation due to clustering of the bright survey at its faintest magnitudes was estimated as @xmath139 , which was comparable to the poisson errors .",
    "the variation due to clustering of the faint survey was estimated from the angular correlation of @xmath140 for @xmath141 measured by carlberg et al .",
    "( 1997 ) from the survey area of 27 arcmin@xmath4 .",
    "the angular radius corresponding to the area of the faint survey is @xmath142 arcsec and its rms variation due to clustering was estimated as @xmath143 or 0.09 dex .",
    "thus the galaxy counts of the faint survey could be significantly affected by clustering .",
    "the @xmath0-band galaxy counts obtained from the bright survey are most precise at @xmath7 because of its large survey area , and agree well with other observations .",
    "these counts are therefore important to model deeper galaxy counts at @xmath125 in small survey areas to constrain the geometry of the universe .",
    "in addition , we confirm that the steep increase of the galaxy counts shows a turnover around @xmath144 , as gardner et al .",
    "( 1993 ) found that the slope changed from @xmath38 to @xmath121 at @xmath145 .",
    "this indicates that the galaxies around @xmath146 have the largest contribution to the extragalactic background radiation in the @xmath0-band , because at this magnitude the slope of the integrated luminosity begins to converge .",
    "the @xmath0-band galaxy counts obtained from the faint survey have large errors , and they are slightly lower than other observations and the bright survey as shown in figure [ fig6 ] . however , the faint survey is subject to large poisson errors and field to field variations due to clustering as described before because of its small survey area .",
    "in addition , we can see in figure [ fig1 ] that objects are more sparsely distributed in the field of the faint survey than in the rest of the bright survey .",
    "therefore , when these uncertainties are considered , the galaxy counts from the faint survey are still consistent with other observations .    in summary",
    ", we present new @xmath0-band galaxy number counts obtained from the @xmath3-band surveys in the sgp region .",
    "the completeness and photometry corrections were estimated with simulations , and the galaxy counts were derived using the probability matrix , @xmath86 , at the faint - end magnitudes close to the detection limits in order to compensate for the photometry errors .",
    "the bright survey provides galaxy counts to @xmath147 , and they agree very well with other observations .",
    "the faint survey provides galaxy counts to @xmath148 , and they are slightly lower compared to other observations and to the bright survey .",

    "<S> we present new @xmath0-band galaxy number counts from @xmath1 to @xmath2 obtained from @xmath3-band surveys in the south galactic pole region , which cover 180.8 arcmin@xmath4 to a limiting magnitude of @xmath5 , and 2.21 arcmin@xmath4 to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> these are currently the most precise @xmath0-band galaxy counts at @xmath7 because the area of coverage is largest among the existing surveys for this magnitude range . </S>",

    "<S> many simulations were carried out to construct a probability matrix which corrects the galaxy counts at the faint - end magnitudes of the surveys so the corrected counts can be compared with other observations . </S>",
