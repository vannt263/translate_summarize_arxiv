    "peng [ 1 ] in connection with the analysis of the @xmath11 reaction .",
    "as one noted , this reaction is characterized by nonrecoil kinematics for a @xmath0-meson . then assuming that the reaction proceeds on a nuclear nucleon providing that : +  - the @xmath9-interaction has attractive character in a s - wave and +  - the reaction time of @xmath0-meson in the nucleus is not small + the @xmath0-mesic nuclei can be formed .      . the interaction of the @xmath0-meson in a s - wave with nucleon can be describe by @xmath2 .",
    "the analysis of the scattering lengths of reactions @xmath12 and @xmath11 carried out by r. bhalerao and l. liu [ 2 ] has shown that scattering length @xmath2 calculated for the reaction @xmath7 is egual to : @xmath13 a positive value of @xmath14 means that + - the interaction in s - wave has attractive character and + - the existence of quasi - bound states of the @xmath0-meson with a nucleus for @xmath15 is possible at this value @xmath14 .",
    "+ the widths of these levels were estimated by q. haider and l. liu [ 3 ] .",
    "the calculated values of width @xmath16 mev mean that the life - time of these states is appoximately 10 times larger then the `` characteristic '' nucleus time @xmath17 sec ) , corresponding to the flight of relativistic particle through the nucleus . + the values of @xmath18 mev for the widths of the bound states of the @xmath0-nuclei are obtained by e. oset et .",
    "+ new calculations [ 5 ] of the scattering length @xmath2 for the @xmath19 reaction were then carried out and the values of @xmath14 were found to be 3 times larger then those from paper [ 2 ] . + this means that the existence of the @xmath0-meson bound states with lighter nuclei having atomic number @xmath20 [ 6 ] and even a=2 [ 7 ] is possible .",
    "2 shows energy dependence of @xmath14 and @xmath21 [ 5 ] .",
    "= 0.7      first experiments on direct reseach for @xmath0-nuclei were undertaked just after calculation of @xmath2 [ 2 ] with using @xmath22 beams at bnl [ 8 ] and lampf [ 9 ] .",
    "the criterion of @xmath0-nuclei selection in the bnl experiment was the observation of narrow kinematic peak @xmath23 mev ) in the spectrum of proton arising in the final state of the 2-particle reaction : @xmath24 the peak width @xmath25 corresponded to the width of the @xmath0 bound state in @xmath26 nuclei [ 3 ] .",
    "+ the trigger of the events was detection only one particle - proton .",
    "the experiment was carried out on a @xmath22 meson beam with momentum of 800 mev / c ising li , c , o and al targets . a narrow peak , 9 mev in width ,",
    "was assumed to be observed in the spectrum of protons for @xmath27 .",
    "however , no narrow kinematic peak was observed for any target in the spectrum p in the expected area .",
    "the authors of paper [ 8 ] would like to note that these negative results can be explaned by : + - a larger width of the expected peak than it was assumed .",
    "+ - a smaller cross section , that it was assumed .",
    "+ - a very bad relation : effect / background @xmath28 .",
    "+ - a too high energy of primary @xmath22-mesons . +  as noted in [ 6 ] @xmath14 is decreased with energy and can become negative at higher energies .",
    "this means that `` attraction '' in the @xmath9 system can be replased by `` repulsion '' .",
    "+ of cousrse , all risons above are important , but in our opinion , the negative results in [ 8 ] can be due in principle the fermi - motion of nucleons in the nucleus",
    ". really , a reaction of the ( 1.2 ) type at a fixed energy of @xmath29-mesons but with the nucleon mowing in the nucleus ( fermi - motion ) is equivalent that on the nucleon at rest , but with energy `` spread '' of @xmath29-beam .",
    "this naturally leads to a sharp energy spread of protons detected at fixed angle @xmath30 . +",
    "an experiment [ 9 ] was carried out on a @xmath22-meson beam with a momentum of 640 mev / c and a harder trigger for event selection corresponding to the production of @xmath0-nuclei was used : proton p was detected on coincidences with @xmath29-meson from the decay of the @xmath3 resonance in the @xmath0-nucleus .",
    "as noted in report [ 9 ] , in this experiment an excess of counts was observed in the expected area for a kinematic peak of protons .",

    "there interpretation requred to use of the representations of nucleus interaction of @xmath0-meson with the nucleus in the intermediate stage of the reaction [ 10 ] .",
    "the characteristic properties of this reaction was : + - a very large cross section in a 10 mev interval at threshold , by two orders greater then the cross section of the reaction with @xmath32-meson production .",
    "+ - practically an isotropic angular distribution of @xmath0-mesons over this energy range ( at threshold ) , which assumed a multiplicity of interaction of @xmath0-mesons with nucleons inside the nucleus . +",
    "an indication of nuclear interaction of @xmath0-meson with the nucleus in the intermediate stage of the reaction was also obtained in the analysis of double charge - exchange reaction @xmath33 [ 12 ] , where a peak was observed in the excitation curve at energy @xmath34 mev corresponding to @xmath0-meson production threshold .",
    "the problem of the @xmath0-nuclei existence for long time @xmath35 years ) remained open after experiments at bnl and lampf with negative results . only in 1998 in the experiment carried out on the 1 gev electron synchrotron at lebedev physical institute the results were obtained which can be interpreted as a direct experimental evidence for the existence of bound @xmath0-meson - nucleus states [ 13 ] .",
    "the experiment was performed on a bremsstrahlung photon beam and correlated @xmath36 pairs , arising from the reaction @xmath37 have been search for . + the experiment was carried out at 2 energies @xmath38 and 850 mev , i.e. lower and above @xmath0-meson production threshold . as noted earlier in paper [ 14 ] , the registration of @xmath39-pairs and the analisis of angular and energy characteristics can be a good criterion of production and consequent decay of quasi - bound state of @xmath0-meson and nucleus in an intermediate stage of reaction ( 2.1 ) .",

    "n is nucleon , proton or neutron . + as result , the full averaging of the energy and angular characteristics of pair components are arised .",

    "@xmath42 due to the fermi motion , @xmath41 pairs from @xmath0-nucleus decays have the characteristic opening angle @xmath43 with the width of @xmath44 .",
    "the kinetic energies are @xmath45 mev and @xmath46 mev with the widths of @xmath47 .",
    "it should be noted that the everage energies @xmath48 and @xmath49 of the decay components were estimated for the @xmath3 resonance bound in the nucleus .",

    "+ in the case when the momentum ( or energy ) of produced @xmath0 is high @xmath52 mev / c ) , the attraction between @xmath0 and the nucleus is not essential and the @xmath0-meson propagates freely ( up to an absorprion , see fig .",
    "=    in this case , the final @xmath41-pairs also carry a high momentum and their kinematic characteristics , such as the opening angle @xmath53 and everage energies @xmath54 , @xmath49 , are different from those for pairs produced through the stage of the @xmath0-nucleus formation . + the kinematics suggests photon energies @xmath55 mev as the most suitable for creating the @xmath0-mesic nuclei .",
    "an experimental set - up consisted of two the time of flight scintillator spectrometers having a time resolution of @xmath56 ns ( fig .",

    "a of charged particles ( of the @xmath58 efficiency ) , placed in - front of the neutron detectors , and de / dx layers , placed between `` start '' and `` stop '' detectors in the pion spectrometer , were used for a better identification of particles .",

    "the first `` calibration '' run was performed at 650 mev with spectrometers positioned at angles @xmath60 around the beam . in that run , this was a quasi - free photoproduction @xmath61 which dominated , the observed yield of the @xmath59 pairs .",
    "then , at the same `` low '' energy 650 mev , the spectrometers were positioned at @xmath62 ( the `` bachground '' run ) , @xmath63 such kinematics the quasi - free production did not contribute and the observed counts were presumably dominated by double pion production . at last , the third run ( the `` effect + background '' ) was performed at the same @xmath64 position , however with the higher photon beam energy of 850 mev , at with @xmath0 mesons are produced too .      in accordance with measured velosities of particles detected by the spectrometers",
    "all candidates to the @xmath59-events were separated into three classes : fast - fast ( ff ) , fast - slow ( fs ) , and slow - slow ( ss ) events .",
    "the ff events mostly correspond to @xmath65 production with results in hitting detectors by photons or @xmath66 .",
    "the fs events mostly emerge from @xmath67-pairs .",
    "the ss events arised from @xmath68 pairs . comparing yields and time spectra in these runs we have found a clear excess of the fs events which appeared when the photon energy exceeded @xmath0 production threshold .",
    "( see [ 13 ] for more details ) . the raw experimental spectrum over the particles velocities",

    "so happened the velocities @xmath70 are subject to fluctuations stremming from errors @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the time - of flight @xmath73 and the flight base @xmath74 .",
    "such fluctuations are cleary seen in the case of the ultra - relativistic ff events . therefore , an experimental @xmath75-resolution of the set - up can be directly inferred from the ff events .",
    "then , using this information and applying an inverse - problem statistical method discribed in ref [ 15 ] , one can unfold the experimental spectrum , obtain a smooth velocity distribution on the physical region @xmath76 .",
    "5 ) , and eventually find a distribution of the particle s kinetic energies    ( 100,55)(0,0 ) ( 40,48)@xmath77 mev ( 90,48)@xmath78 mev    = 4.5 cm    = 0.4    @xmath79 $ ] . finding @xmath80 , we introduced corrections related with every energy losses of particles in absorbers and in the detector matter .",
    "it is worth to say that the number of the @xmath59 fs events visibly increases when the photon beam energy becomes sufficient for producing @xmath0 mesons .      of the most interest",
    "is the distribution of the @xmath59-events over their total energy @xmath81 , because creation and decay of @xmath0-mesic nuclei is expected to produce a relatively narrow peak in @xmath82 ( see [ 13 , 16 ] .",
    "such a peak was indeed observed .    at fig .",
    "6 we see an excess of the fs events appears when the photon energy exceeds the @xmath0-production threshold .",
    "these @xmath59 pairs arise from creation and decay of captured bound @xmath0 in the nucleus , i.e. they arise throngh the stage of formation of an @xmath0-mesic nucleus .",
    "the second important results is a `` shift '' of the position of @xmath3 resonance decayed into nuclei .    on fig .",
    "7 we have a 1-dimensional energy distribution of the @xmath59 events presumably coming from bound @xmath0 decaing in the nuclei .",
    "the experimental width of this distribution is about 100 mev including the apparatus resolution .",
    "its center lies by @xmath83 mev below the energy excess @xmath84 mev in reaction @xmath85 , and it is well below the position of the @xmath3 resonance too .",
    "+ up to effects of binding of protons annihilated in the decay subprocess @xmath86 , the value @xmath87 characterizes the binding energy of @xmath0 in the nucleus .",
    "the width of that peak is determined both by the width of the @xmath0-bound state and by the fermi motion .",
    "the first results which gives the evidence for existence of the bound state of @xmath0-meson and nucleus in intermediate stage photomesonic processees are obtained at lpi [ 13 ] .",
    "the use of intensive monochromatic beams of protons with energies of some gev may look promising to study @xmath0-mesic nuclei .",

    "+ the production cross sections of @xmath0-meson in elementary processes @xmath91 and @xmath92 are practicaly similar .",
    "however , the advantage of p - beams consist in their much greater intensity ( by 2 - 3 orders ) in comparising with @xmath29-meson beams ( the latter are secondary beams of proton accelerators ) .",
    "this circumstance is important as the production cross sections of @xmath0-nuclei in @xmath93-collisions are expected at a level of some tens microbarns .",
    "+ the event selections of @xmath0-mesic nuclei production in @xmath93-collisions are assumed to be made by registrating 4 particles : @xmath94 and @xmath95 protons produced in the 1-st stage of the reaction ( 3.1 ) and @xmath96 pairs from the decay of the @xmath0-mesic nucleus ( fig .",

    "+ the use of the internal beam affords unique opportunities to study processes with small cross sections through the full interaction of the beam with a `` wire '' target so the total intensity can reach @xmath99 p / hours and a low nouse level since the background particles are not practically multiplied into the target .",
