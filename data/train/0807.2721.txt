    "however experiments at jlab , panda and besiii are expected to significantly advance our knowledge of gluonic excitations through measurements of decay channels that couple to exotic quantum numbers carried by hybrids .",
    "panda and besiii will in particular be sensitive to charmonium hybrids .",
    "modern studies of gluon dominated hadron spectra have been possible through lattice simulations  @xcite while in early days of hadron phenomenology various effective models have been developed  @xcite . among these",
    "the constituent , or quasi - particle approach have had may successes in particular in the context of heavy quarkonia . for gluonic excitations in presence of heavy quarks",
    "the born - oppenheimer approximation can be employed to replace the ( fast ) gluon field by an effective potential between the non - relativistic quarks  @xcite .",
    "these effective potentials originate from excited gluon configurations and can be reliably computed using lattice gauge simulations and afterwards used to construct hybrid heavy quarkonia  @xcite . keeping the quark - antiquark sources static and taking their separation to zero results in a spectrum of the so called gluelumps which describe the gluon field bound to a static color octet source  @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural to expect that there should be a close relation between spectrum of gluelumps and heavy quarkonium hybrids .",
    "this is because in the latter the average spacial separation between heavy quarks is small , of the order of @xmath0 where , @xmath1 is the heavy quark mass and @xmath2 is the running coupling evaluated at distance scale @xmath3 .",
    "recent lattice simulations of the charmonium spectrum in quenched qcd beyond the born - oppenheimer approximation also lead to more states then predicted by the quarkonium potential models potentially indicating presence of gluonic excitations  @xcite . in the quenched approximation and with non - relativistic quarks",
    "the connection between heavy quarkonium spectrum and the potential model can be made precise . in the context of the wilson loop formalism",
    "this has been done in  @xcite where potential matrix elements between heavy quarkonium states were related to correlation functions containing qcd gluon field operators . in  @xcite the foldy - wouthousen formalism",
    "was used instead and the effective non - relativistic qcd hamiltonian in the coulomb gauge was derived . in this framework",
    "all operators conserve the heavy quark quark number and depend on the gluon field .",
    "the effective @xmath4 potential matrix elements in general depend on the distribution of the gluon field in the system .",
    "in general , gluon distribution in the vacuum and in a state containing a @xmath4 pair are different . in",
    "@xcite it was found that at large separations the coulomb energy exceeds that of true static quarkonium state .",
    "this makes possible to interpret the former as a variational approximation to the true @xmath4 qcd state .",
    "this difference has simple interpretation in the coulomb gauge  @xcite .",
    "the coulomb energy corresponds to the energy of an approximate , variational state with the @xmath4 pair added to the qcd vacuum .",
    "gluon - number changing interactions in the coulomb potential couple the @xmath4 source to an arbitrary number of transverse gluons which eventually produces the string - like qcd @xmath4 eigenstate whose energy is that of the wilson loop . extrapolating to small @xmath4 separations , however , a reasonable initial approximation would be to assume that the gluon field is not significantly disturbed by the heavy quark sources and to build the spectrum of gluon excitation using an effective gluon fock space that is independent from the sources .",
    "such a spectrum was constructed in  @xcite using a variational mean field approximation and describes effective massive gluons propagating in a nonperturbative vacuum .",
    "we will use this fock space here and combine it with non - relativistic quark an antiquark to compute spectrum of heavy hybrids .",
