    "much progress has been made in modelling nucleosynthesis in stars in general , but the origin of nitrogen still remains somewhat uncertain . in the classical picture , the apparent increase in nitrogen production with metallicity , as inferred from spectroscopy of galactic and extragalactic hii - regions , is a manifestation of nitrogen being either primary or secondary ( produced from primordial elements or with heavier elements as `` seeds '' ) .",
    "however , reality often turns out to be more complex than our simplest models of it .",
    "the origin of nitrogen is probably no exception .    during the last few years",
    ", reasonably accurate stellar nitrogen abundances have become available also for population ii stars ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the rather large nitrogen abundances relative to iron seen in halo stars in the milky way suggest that a relatively large fraction of the nitrogen should come from type ii supernovae , especially at low metallicity .",
    "however , recent stellar evolution models , including nucleosynthesis , all appear to predict significant nitrogen production in intermediate - mass ( i m ) stars ( @xcite )",
    ". the typical production factor would be of the order @xmath0 of the initial stellar mass .",
    "if im - stars of all metallicities produce that much nitrogen , it would require that metal - poor galaxies ( or regions within a galaxy ) with low n / o - ratios have very young stellar populations , in fact , they have to be so young that im - stars have not yet made any significant contribution to the interstellar nitrogen abundance of these objects , unless the production of oxygen is much greater at low metallicity .    in this work",
    "i have considered radial gradients of o / h and n / o in the milky way and five other nearby late - type galaxies in order to find additional clues to the origin of nitrogen .",
    "the advantages of considering the abundance gradients within galaxies , rather than over - all trends obtained from the global properties of galaxies , are that the same stellar nucleosynthesis prescriptions ( yields ) must be able to simultaneously reproduce the radial abundance gradients in galaxies with quite different properties ( sizes , total masses , gas distributions , etc . ) and the very same yields must also be consistent with the fact that galaxies with similar o / h - gradients may have quite different n / o - gradients .",
    "models of chemical evolution ( cems ) may thus be able to provide insight and constraints on stellar yields when several galaxies are modelled and analysed in parallel .",

    "since the halo contributes very little to the present - day abundance gradients , except for at very large galactic radii , where the disc density becomes comparable with the halo density ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the model is constructed as a single exponential disc , formed by exponentially decaying baryonic infall , i.e. , @xmath2\\right\\}^{-1}\\exp\\left[-{t\\over\\tau(r)}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the infall - time scale and @xmath4 denotes present time .",

    ". however , for the other five galaxies , this combination of imf and yields does not really improve the fit to the observed abundances .",
    "hence , resolving the o / h - n / o - inconsistency by changing the imf requires that the imf varies over the galactic disc , or , effectively , from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "a stellar - metallicity dependence in the nitrogen yields of i m stars is also a reasonable explanation .",
    "since the n / o - gradients predicted by the models are too flat in three cases ( ngc 224 , ngc 2403 and ngc 6946 ) , the yields may need to increase with metallicity .",

    "it is quite likely that such an _ ad - hoc _ modification of the yields may lead to gradients that are too steep for the milky way and ngc 3031 .",
    "employing a standard imf ( @xcite ) with a high - mass cut - off at @xmath21 the o / h - gradients are well - reproduced by numerical cems .",
    "however , the n / o - gradients can not , in general , be reproduced simultaneously .",
    "this inconsistency can be explained in several ways , e.g. ,    1 .",
    "the production of nitrogen in intermediate - mass stars is strongly correlated with metallicity , 2 .",
    "the imf varies over the galactic disc ( or , effectively , from galaxy to galaxy ) such that the n / o - ratio is affected , 3 .   the infalling gas that forms the disc is not primordial , but significantly enriched with heavier elements ( from pop .",
    "iii or pop .",
    "ii stars ? ) , 4 .   or the p - method produces systematic errors .",
    "i believe that the explanations ( a ) and ( b ) are more likely then the other two . the main reasons are : ( 1 ) many ingredients of stellar evolution models that affects the nucleosynthetic yields ( e.g. , mass loss rates and the efficiency of hot - bottom burning ) are still highly uncertain , and",
    "( 2 ) the turn - over in the imf at low stellar masses appears correlated with the jeans mass ( @xcite ) , ( 3 ) significant effects from chemically enriched infall is only expected in the outer parts of the discs , where the abundances are low , and ( 4 ) the p - method is in very good agreement with the standard electron - temperature method ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the stellar yields and detailed properties of the imf are probably the greatest uncertainties in cems in general .     variations of the imf . changing the slope of a simple power - law imf ( @xmath22 @xmath23 are left unchanged ) will shift the o / h - gradient up or down ( see left panel ) , but leave @xmath24 almost unaffected . a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf ( @xmath25 ) which provides an acceptable fit to the observed n / o - ratios ( right panel).,width=498 ]    leonid pilyugin",
