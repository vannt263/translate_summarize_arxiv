    "the fundamental plane has been a useful diagnostic of galaxy distances and galaxy evolution ( e.g. dressler et al . 1987 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ; jrgensen et al .",
    "1996 ; pahre et al . 1998 ; bernardi et al . 2003 ; jrgensen et al . 2007 ) .",
    "if galaxies are virialized , then one expects observable signatures of the balance between potential and kinetic energies .",
    "for example , @xmath19 where @xmath18 is a velocity dispersion , @xmath20 is a surface brightness , @xmath21 is a scale , and @xmath22 is the mass to light ratio .",
    "this suggests that the observed line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath23 and surface brightness @xmath24 at or within some fiducial radius @xmath25 should be correlated with one another .",
    "( in what follows , we will use the subscript @xmath26 to denote quantities estimated from devaucouleur s ( 1948 ) fits to the surface brightness profiles . )    velocity dispersion and surface brightness are distance - independent observables , whereas the size is not , so it is common to write @xmath27 and to find that pair @xmath28 for which the scatter either in the @xmath25 direction , or in the direction orthogonal to the plane , is minimized .",
    "if the resulting values of @xmath28 differ from the virial scalings @xmath29 , then the fundamental plane is said to be ` tilted ' .",
    "the tilt of the fundamental plane is interpreted as evidence that the mass - to - light ratio @xmath30 depends on some combination of the observables @xmath31  the prejudice that galaxies are virialized sets what this combination must be : @xmath32 . in low redshift ( @xmath33 ) samples , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , so the implied @xmath22 is expected to increase slightly with @xmath36 or @xmath17 .",
    "jrgensen et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 at @xmath40 .",
    "contributions to the tilt of the fundamental plane can be further examined by expressing the mass - to - light ratio in terms of the dynamical mass , total mass , stellar mass , and broadband luminosity : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the sum of dark matter and baryonic mass , @xmath43 is the stellar mass , and @xmath17 is the observed broadband luminosity . if any of these terms varies as a function of @xmath36 or @xmath17 , the plane will be tilted .",
    "the assumption that @xmath44 is constant is the assumption of homology .",
    "the validity of this assumption is supported by detailed kinematic modeling of galaxies observed with sauron integral - field spectroscopy .",
    "the combination of 2-d photometric and spectroscopic data allowed cappellari et al .",
    "( 2007 ) to account for differences in e.g. @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "they found that dynamical mass is a robust tracer of total mass .",
    "more recent work by bolton et al .",
    "( 2008 ) suggests that the devaucouleur - based quantity @xmath48 is linearly proportional to the mass estimated from the strong gravitational lensing effect , further reinforcing the homology assumption that @xmath49 .    for a given imf ,",
    "the stellar mass to light ratio , @xmath50 , depends on the age and metallicity of the stellar population as well as on wavelength ( e. g. , tinsley 1978 ; worthey 1994 ) .",
    "there is now growing evidence for correlations between mass and metallicity ( e.g. , trager et al .",
    "2000 ; nelan et al . 2005 ; thomas et al .",
    "2005 ) , and between age and velocity dispersion ( e.g. , bernardi et al .",
    "hence , stellar population models predict that @xmath50 will depend on total mass and luminosity , plausibly producing a tilt that will depend on waveband .",
    "while there is evidence that the tilt does indeed depend on waveband , the dependence is weak ( pahre et al .",
    "1998 ; bernardi et al .",
    "2003 ; la barbera et al .",
    "2008 ) , and so this effect alone can not explain all of the tilt .",
    "there is little discussion in the literature of the possibility that the imf changes along the sequence in such a way as to make the dependence on @xmath51 weak .",
    "if there is no such effect , then stellar population effects and non - homology are weak , so the dominating contribution to the tilt of the fundamental plane is due to the systematic variation of @xmath52 with mass . in a hierarchical scenario of galaxy formation , the relative distribution of stars and dark matter in a galaxy",
    "depend on the roles of dissipational and dissipationless merging ( e.g. bender et al .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy mergers ( robertson et al .",
    "2006 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2008 ) suggest that the fractional gas content of merging galaxies determines the fundamental plane of their remnants .",
    "further dissipationless mergers preserve the fundamental plane , but not its projections ( e.g. , boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "observations of brightest cluster galaxies by bernardi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) support these conclusions .",
    "the dissipational content in mergers sets the effective mass - to - light ratio of the merger remnant ( robertson et al .",
    "2006 ; hopkins et al . 2008 ) .",
    "if the dissipational content varies with mass ( in spirals the gas fraction decreases with mass , e.g. bell & dejong 2000 ) , this would cause a systematic dependence of the mass - to - light ratio with mass .",
    "if this ratio varies as a power law with mass ( @xmath53 ) , then the fundamental plane would be tilted relative to the virial scaling .",
    "if the mass - to - light ratio varies in a more complicated manner , the fundamental plane could be warped , or have a more complicated shape .",
    "therefore , in the present work , we separate out the contribution from these effects by re - writing equation  ( [ vir ] ) as : @xmath54 we do not consider variation of @xmath55 , since two rather different methods ( cappellari et al . 2007 ; bolton et al . 2008 ) suggest that this ratio is a constant across the early - type population .",
    "( this is also why we do not include effects associated with fitting sersic s 1968 generalization of the devaucouleur profile to the images , even though there is a well - developed literature on this subject . ) if the stellar population models which one uses to estimate @xmath51 are accurate , then multiplying the surface brightness by @xmath51 should eliminate most of the dependence on waveband .",
    "( there is a small remaining dependence which arises from the fact that the half - light radii are slightly but systematically smaller in redder bands , e.g. hyde & bernardi 2009 ) .",
    "the remaining term @xmath56 is the ratio of the dynamical to stellar mass , which we will use as our proxy for structural differences .",
    "this is interesting because @xmath57 is not expected to be very much greater than unity ",
    "recent work suggests that @xmath58 ( capellari et al . 2007 )  how it scales with mass is a quantity of great interest to galaxy formation models ( e.g. bower et al .",
    "2006 ; delucia et al .",
    "2006 ; hopkins et al . 2008 ) , and previous work in the sdss suggests that @xmath57 is not constant across the early - type population ( padmanabhan et al .",
    "2004 ; gallazzi et al .",
    "2006 )    section  [ fptrad ] discusses how we select our sample and shows the result of fitting for the coefficients @xmath28 of the traditional fundamental plane in the sdss @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 bands .",
    "( appendix  a shows that our sample probably contains some non - early - type galaxies but they are too few to affect our conclusions . )",
    "we also study the possibility of detecting if the plane is warped , or merely thick .",
    "this is prompted in part by recent work showing that the parameters of the fitted fundamental plane appear to depend on the luminosity and velocity dispersion range of the sample ( donofrio et al .",
    "2008 ; nigoche - netro et al .",
    "we show that such dependences exist in thick planes that are not warped ",
    "they are a consequence of not accounting for selection effects .",
    "we then discuss more reliable estimates of curvature along the plane .",
    "section  [ fpmass ] describes our estimates of @xmath51 and the result of fitting for the coefficients @xmath59 in @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "the difference between @xmath59 and @xmath28 is due to stellar population effects ; the difference between @xmath59 and the virial scalings @xmath29 encodes information about @xmath57 . if @xmath62 then @xmath56 increases with @xmath36 or @xmath43 for the same reason that @xmath63 implies @xmath30 increases with @xmath36 or @xmath17 .",
    "a complementary analysis of the fundamental plane variables was introduced by bender , burstein & faber ( 1992 ) .",
    "this construction , which they termed @xmath13-space , was criticized as being an `` obfuscation , not a simplification '' , by pahre et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , primarily on the grounds that @xmath25 and @xmath64 depend on waveband .",
    "however , by replacing luminosity with stellar mass , what we will call @xmath65-space , most of the wavelength dependence is removed ; only the weak dependence of @xmath25 on waveband remains .",
    "so it is interesting to examine how early - types are distributed in @xmath65-space .",
    "section  [ kspace ] presents the first analysis of @xmath65-space .",
    "the scaling of @xmath66 with @xmath36 referred above is the edge - on view of the @xmath65-plane .",
    "the face - on view provides a relation between the maximum stellar density and dynamical mass of early - type galaxies .",
    "a final section summarizes our findings and discusses some implications .",
    "we use the sample of about 50,000 early - type galaxies assembled by hyde & bernardi ( 2008 ) .",
    "the sample is based on the sdss - dr4 , but with photometric and spectroscopic parameters updated from the sdss - dr6 database .",
    "briefly , objects have devaucouleur magnitudes @xmath67 , @xmath68 in both the @xmath1- and @xmath2-bands , and axis ratios @xmath69 .",
    "appendix  a shows that these cuts almost certainly do not yield a pure early - type galaxy sample ( e.g. , the face - on analogues of the objects with fracdev=1 and @xmath70 are still in our sample ) . however , the non - early types in our sample are too few to affect our conclusions .",
    "photometric parameters for the best - fit devaucouleur surface brightness profiles are `` corrected '' for known problems which arise from the sdss sky - subtraction algorithm .",
    "in addition , there are some systematic differences between the velocity dispersions output by sdss - dr6 and the idlspec2d reduction ( hyde & bernardi 2009 ) .",
    "our velocity dispersion estimates are simply the average of the two reductions ( section  [ errors ] discusses the dependence of the fundamental plane parameters on systematics ) .",
    "we also compute the velocity dispersion for objects for which the sdss pipeline does not estimate @xmath18 ( due to low @xmath71 or the presence of weak emission lines , i.e. the status flag not - equal to 4 ) .",
    "we select galaxies with velocity dispersions @xmath72  km  s@xmath73 .",
    "the velocity dispersions are then corrected to @xmath74 .",
    "stellar mass estimates , from gallazzi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , are available for all these objects .",
    "since these are actually stellar mass to light ratios multiplied by a luminosity , and we have corrected the luminosities for the sky - subtraction problems whereas gallazzi et al . did not , we apply a correction to their stellar masses to account for this effect . where necessary , distances were computed from redshifts assuming a hubble constant of @xmath75  km  s@xmath76  mpc@xmath73 in a flat @xmath77cdm model with @xmath78 .",
    "we fit the plane as follows .",
    "we begin by writing the fundamental plane as @xmath79 where @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is the mean surface brightness within the half light radius , defined explicitly as follows : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the evolution , reddening , and k - corrected apparent magnitude ( refer to hyde & bernardi 2009 for details on magnitudes ) , and @xmath84 is the angular size in arcseconds . in this form",
    ", the virial scaling would follow @xmath85 because of the @xmath86 term in the definition of @xmath81 . unless we say so explicitly , we work in logarithmic units .",
    "therefore , following bernardi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we will sometimes abuse notation by using @xmath21 to denote @xmath87/kpc ) , @xmath88 to denote @xmath89/km  s@xmath73 ) , and @xmath20 to denote @xmath81 .",
    "thus , for example , @xmath90 and @xmath91 denote the measurement errors on @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath81 .",
    "the shape of the fundamental plane is determined by estimating @xmath15 and @xmath94 .",
    "this is done either by minimizing residuals in the @xmath25 direction , or in the direction orthogonal to the fit . in general the ` direct ' and ` orthogonal ' fit parameters",
    "are different combinations of the mean values of and covariances between the variables @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath81",
    ".    in practice , naive estimation of these means and covariances ( e.g. simply summing over the data without including other weight terms ) may lead to biases induced by measurement errors ( these usually affect the covariances ) or by selection effects ( which bias the means and the covariances ) .",
    "the effects of both must be accounted - for to estimate the intrinsic shape parameters @xmath15 and @xmath94 ( e.g. saglia et al .",
    "this is especially important when the fp is determined for galaxies in a magnitude limited sample ( bernardi et al .",
    "we do this following methods described in sheth & bernardi ( 2009 ) . analytic expressions which quantify the bias in the fundamental plane due to the magnitude limit of the survey may be found there .",
    "briefly , the effect of the magnitude limit is removed by weighting each object by @xmath97 , the inverse of the volume over which it could have been observed , and measurement errors are subtracted in quadrature from the measured covariances .",
    "the mean values of magnitude , size , surface - brightness , and velocity dispersion in the @xmath2-band are @xmath98 with typical measurement errors @xmath99 we find that the intrinsic covariance matrix ( i.e. corrected for measurement errors and the magnitude limited selection effect ) is @xmath100 from this covariance matrix we obtain @xmath101 the observed rms scatter about the direct fit is 0.107 , of which 0.096 is intrinsic .",
    "these quantities for the orthogonal fit are 0.066 and 0.058 respectively .",
    "the uncertainty on the coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath94 is dominated by systematic effects more than random errors , as described here below .",
    "typical uncertainties on the coefficients due to random errors are @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "sytematics errors give @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we analyze how the uncertainty on @xmath15 and @xmath94 depend on sample size using bootstrap resampling .",
    "figures  [ err_coef ] and  [ err_rms ] show how @xmath106 and @xmath107 depend on sample size .",
    "they were obtained by dividing the total sample up into smaller subsamples , each containing @xmath108 galaxies . for a given @xmath108",
    ", we do not include any galaxy more than once , so there are a total of @xmath109 subsamples .",
    "we then fit the fp in each subsample , and computed the mean and rms values of @xmath15 , @xmath94 and intrinsic scatter .",
    "figure  [ err_coef ] shows that the precision increases as the number of objects in the sample increases , as one might expect .",
    "however , figure  [ err_rms ] shows that sample sizes smaller than about 300 tend to result in underestimates of the intrinsic scatter , in good agreement with la barbera et al .",

    "if we only use the dr6 values , we find @xmath113 with intrinsic scatter @xmath114  dex , and @xmath115 with scatter @xmath116  dex .",

    "this suggests that we should assume as typical systematic error @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "these values are larger than the random errors quoted above , showing that is important to separate random from systematic errors .",
    "if we do not account for selection effects we find mean values @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , and covariances @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",

    "note that the intrinsic scatter is smaller !",
    "this is largely because the distribution of luminosities in a magnitude limited survey is narrower than in a volume limited survey ( because the faint objects are under - represented ) ; if one does not account for this , then the magnitude limited catalog is more homogeneous , making for a tighter fp .",
    "the fact that the coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath94 hardly change is largely fortuitous ( sheth & bernardi 2009 show why they are expected to change ) ; it happens because the scaling relations are actually slightly curved ( see section  [ curved ] , and also hyde & bernardi 2009 ) .",

    "this yields @xmath155 evidently , the dashed line expresses a relation between stellar density and dynamical mass : the upper limit to the stellar density is approximately proportional to @xmath156 .",
    "we showed that the slope of the traditional , luminosity - based fundamental plane fp depends weakly but systematically on waveband  it steepens towards the virial relation in the redder bands ( figure  [ fpgriz ] and table  [ griz ] ) .",
    "replacing @xmath17 with stellar mass @xmath43 leads to coefficients which are slightly closer to the virial ones ; this is true whether one estimates @xmath51 from the spectra or simply from broad band colors ( table  [ abmst ] and figure  [ fpmstars ] ) .",
    "the stellar mass fp is slightly thinner ( with an average intrinsic scatter of @xmath157  dex ) than the luminosity - based fp ( which has a typical intrinsic scatter larger than @xmath158  dex ) .",
    "the intrinsic scatter also decreases with wavelengths : from 0.062  dex in @xmath1 to 0.054  dex in @xmath4 .",
    "we also showed that the intrinsic scatter around both the luminosity - based and stellar mass planes becomes significantly broader at low sizes / masses ( figures  [ residfpgriz ] and [ fpmstars ] ) and that measurement errors account for essentially all of the observed scatter ( about 0.04  dex ) at large sizes / masses , suggesting that the plane is rather thin for the very massive galaxies .",
    "the fundamental nature of the stellar mass plane fp@xmath159 , and the fact that @xmath160 color is a good indicator of @xmath51 ( e.g. bell et al .",
    "2003 ) , explains why residuals from fp correlate with color ( e.g. bernardi et al .",
    "2003 ) , or , equivalently , why color may be thought of as the fourth fundamental parameter in early - type galaxy scaling relations .",
    "the fact that fp@xmath159 does not quite have the virial scalings suggests that the ratio of stellar to dynamical mass , @xmath66 should vary across the population .",
    "figure  [ showms ] showed this was indeed the case : @xmath161 .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the results of the sauron project ( cappellari et al .",
    "2007 ) , which is based on a very different analysis technique . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the fundamental plane method is technically less challenging , so we expect it to provide a useful measure of the evolution of @xmath57 .",
    "this will also provide a useful check on the suggestion that the slope of the correlation between @xmath36 and @xmath43 does not evolve out to @xmath162 ( bundy et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we also presented an analysis of @xmath13-space ( bender et al .",
    "1992 ) , but after replacing luminosities with stellar masses ( using values from gallazzi et al . 2005 ) .",

    "the face - on view of the plane in this space ( figure  [ fpkspace ] ) showed that the maximum stellar density is smaller in the more massive objects : @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath65-space scalings at low redshift , and an estimate of how they evolve , should provide interesting constraints on galaxy formation models .",
    "datasets are now sufficiently large that statistically significant curvature in most scaling relations has now been seen ( e.g. hyde & bernardi 2009 ) . however , illustrating that the fundamental plane is warped is more difficult .",
    "previous work has shown that the coefficients of the fp can change dramatically as objects of different type ( e.g. low luminosity or @xmath18 ) are removed from the sample ( e.g. bernardi et al .",
    "2003 for dependence on @xmath18 , and donofrio et al .",
    "2008 and nigoche - netro et al .",
    "2008 for dependence on @xmath17 ) .",
    "this has lead to the suggestion that these changes indicate that the fp is warped ( e.g. donofrio et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we showed that similar changes arise even in samples where the underlying pairwise scaling relations are not curved ",
    "i.e. , when the plane is not warped ( sections  [ cutl ] and  [ cutv ] ) .",
    "thus , the dependence of the fit parameters on the range of @xmath17 or @xmath18 in the sample is not , by itself , evidence for curvature .",
    "this dependence on the range of @xmath17 or @xmath18 may explain some of the relatively wide range of fundamental plane coefficients in the literature .    a more robust measure of how warped the plane was also discussed .",
    "we showed that a good understanding of the errors is necessary to interpret the results ; else , correlated errors might lead one to conclude there is curvature even when there is none ( figure  [ residfpgriz ] and discussion in section  [ curved ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the plane is warped at the low size / mass end ( figures  [ residfpgriz ] and  [ fpmstars ] ) , and that it is also significantly broader at low sizes / masses .",
    "these conclusions are not affected by a low rate of spiral galaxy contamination , as discussed in appendix a.    our analysis of the bias introduced in the fp coefficients by cuts in @xmath17 and @xmath18 raises an interesting puzzle .",
    "the @xmath163 objects in the slacs sample ( bolton et al .",
    "2008 ) were selected because they are gravitational lenses , meaning that they tend to have large velocity dispersions .",
    "the sample is particularly interesting because dynamic , stellar and gravitational lensing mass estimates are available .",
    "although the small sample size means the intrinsic thickness of the fp in this sample is almost certainly underestimated ( figure  [ err_rms ] ) , what is of interest here is the fact that the smallest velocity dispersion in this sample is @xmath164  km  s@xmath73 .",
    "bolton et al .",
    "make no attempt to correct for the fact that their sample has no objects with small @xmath18 .",
    "instead , they argue that , given the same size and velocity dispersion distributions , the slacs sample has approximately the same luminosity distribution as the parent sdss sample from which it was drawn .",
    "they also report that the coefficients of the fundamental plane for their sample are rather close to the virial scalings , and they use this to motivate a number of conclusions about the origin of ` tilt ' in most early - type samples .",
    "however , our figure  [ fpabv ] suggests that if objects with @xmath165 km  s@xmath73 are missing from the sample ( this is a fairly standard cut - off based on what most spectrographs used for this work are capable of ) , and no account is made of this , then @xmath166 is biased high by about 15% ( also see discussion in section 2.2 as well as figure  4 in bernardi et al .",
    "if objects with @xmath167  km  s@xmath73 are missing , then @xmath166 is biased to values which are close to 2 !",
    "thus it is possible that the slope @xmath166 in the slacs sample is high simply because it is biased .",
    "if so , then the conclusions about the origin of ` tilt ' should be revised .",

    "this shows that @xmath68 removes most of the spirals and others  our further cuts help in reducing the left over contamination .",

    "<S> from a sample of @xmath0 early - type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , we measured the traditional fundamental plane in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands . </S>",
    "<S> we then replaced luminosity with stellar mass , and measured the `` stellar mass '' fundamental plane . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental plane , @xmath5 , steepens slightly as one moves from shorter to longer wavelengths : the orthogonal fit has slope @xmath6 in the @xmath1 band and @xmath7 in @xmath4 , with a statistical random error of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> however , systematic effects can produce larger uncertainties , of order @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental plane is thinner at longer wavelengths : it has an intrinsic scatter of 0.062  dex in @xmath1 and 0.054  dex in @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we have clear evidence that the scatter is larger at small galaxy sizes / masses ; at large masses measurement errors account for essentially all of the observed scatter ( about 0.04  dex ) , suggesting that the plane is rather thin for the very massive galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental plane steepens further when luminosity is replaced with stellar mass , to @xmath10 or @xmath11 when stellar masses are estimated from broad - band colors or from spectra , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic scatter also reduces further , to 0.048  dex on average . </S>",
    "<S> since color and stellar mass - to - light ratio are closely related , this explains why color can be thought of as the fourth fundamental plane parameter . </S>",
    "<S> however , the slope of the stellar mass fundamental plane remains shallower than the value of 2 associated with the virial theorem . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the ratio of dynamical to stellar mass increases at large masses : @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling is the edge - on projection of the stellar mass @xmath13-space . </S>",
    "<S> the face - on view suggests that there is an upper limit to the stellar density for a given dynamical mass , and this decreases at large masses : @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> all these trends can be used to constrain early - type galaxy formation models .    </S>",
    "<S> we also study how the estimated coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the plane are affected by other selection effects , whether in apparent or absolute quantities . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if low luminosity objects are missing from the sample , and one does not account for this , then @xmath15 and @xmath16 are both biased low from their true values . </S>",
    "<S> if objects with small velocity dispersions are missing , then @xmath15 is biased high , although this matters more for the orthogonal than the direct - fitted quantities . </S>",
    "<S> these biases are seen in fundamental planes which have no intrinsic curvature , so the observation that @xmath15 and @xmath16 scale with @xmath17 and @xmath18 is not , by itself , evidence that the plane is warped . on the other hand , we show that the plane appears to curve sharply downwards at the small - size / mass end , and more gradually downwards as one moves towards larger sizes / masses . whereas the drop at small sizes is real , most of the latter effect is due to correlated errors .    </S>",
