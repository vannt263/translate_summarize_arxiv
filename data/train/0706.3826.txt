    "we have computed the x - ray and far infrared ( fir ) luminosities expected in a massive , young starburst using the cmhk ( cervio , mas - hesse & kunth ) synthesis population models @xcite . a salpeter initial mass function ( @xmath3 ) has been assumed , with masses within the range @xmath4 , 2 different star formation regimes  instantaneous burst ( ib ) or constant star formation rate ( csfr )  and solar metallicities . we have analyzed the first 30 myrs after the onset of a massive starburst episode .    the x - ray luminosity is calculated in the range @xmath5 kev .",
    "the models compute only the emisison by the diffuse gas heated by the mechanical energy released by stellar winds and supernova remnants .",
    "the x - ray emission is modeled by raymond - smith thermal plasmas with a range of temperatures typical of starburst galaxies ( between 0.5 and 1.0 kev ) .",
    "the fraction of mechanical energy @xmath6 effectively heating the gas up to x - rays temperatures is left as a free parameter .",
    "the contribution by x - ray binaries and stellar atmospheres has not been considered , since it should be negligible ( cervio et al .",
    "2002 ) .    a thermal equilibrium of dust has been assumed , which implies all energy absorbed by dust being reemitted in the far infrared range .",
    "the models assume that a fraction @xmath7 of lyman continuum photons are directly absorbed by the dust .",
    "the absorption of of uv  optical continuum photons is parameterized through @xmath8 .",
    "the values considered were @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "figure  [ fig : figu1 ] shows the evolution of the soft x  ray luminosity and the @xmath1/@xmath2 ratio , as predicted by the models assuming different star formation regimes and efficiencies .",
    "we want to stress that this ratio is strongly dependent on the evolutionary state of the starburst , spanning around 2 orders of magnitude within few million years .",
    "the data samples from @xcite and @xcite ( hereinafter , _ ran _ and _ tul _ respectively ) were chosen in order to compare with the predictions from the models .",
    "as shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : figu1 ] , the observational ratios can be well reproduced by the synthesis models considering efficiency values in the range @xmath11 , typical of starburst galaxies ( cervio et al .",
    "moreover , our results show that the dispersion observed in the samples ratios can be explained as being mostly an evolutionary effect .",
    "therefore we conclude that the empirical calibration of the soft x - ray luminosity as an sfr ( star formation rate ) tracer has to be taken with care , since it would be valid only for starbursts around a relatively short period of time .",
