    "dance ( detector for advanced neutron capture experiments ) is a 4@xmath1 detector array that consists of up to 160 elements of barium fluoride crystals .",
    "it is designed to study capture reactions on small quantities of radioactive isotopes , which are of interest to studies in nuclear astrophysics and stockpile stewardship science .",
    "dance is located on the 20  m neutron flight path 14 ( fp14 ) at the manuel lujan jr .",
    "neutron scattering center at the los alamos neutron science center ( lansce ) @xcite .",
    "the neutrons are produced via spallation reactions caused by an 800 mev proton beam hitting a tungsten target with typical beam currents of 100  @xmath2a .",
    "depending on the flight path , the fast neutrons are moderated by water or other moderators .",
    "fp14 is designed to view only the uncoupled water moderator and not the tungsten target itself .",
    "a direct neutron capture measurement in an environment like this faces three major types of background :    \\1 .",
    "time - independent background , which is not correlated with the neutron beam . natural radioactivity or , in case of baf@xmath3 detectors , intrinsic radioactivity are prominent examples . if the sample is radioactive , it will introduce another source of time - independent background .",
    "time - dependent background , which is every background component that is correlated with the time structure of the beam , but does not scale with the size of the sample in the beam .",
    "examples are neutrons scattered from other experiments , or any particles originating at the neutron production area .",
    "sample - related background due to two processes : + 3a ) ( n , n ) reactions , where the neutrons are eventually captured in the surrounding material ( in case of dance mainly baf@xmath3 ) and create a similar signature as capture in the sample .",
    "+ 3b ) ( @xmath0,x ) , where x includes all the possible interaction mechanisms between matter and photons ( photo - effect , compton scattering , pair production etc . ) .",
    "most of the interactions are with the electrons in the sample material .",
    "while ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are usually determined by simple beam on / off and sample in / out experiments , more sophisticated measurements are needed to determine the sample related background ( 3 ) . in order to determine the background due to scattered neutrons ( 3a ) , either the time structure or the energy information of the total @xmath0-ray energy released is used .",
    "classical ( n,@xmath0 ) experiments were optimized to have detectors with very low neutron sensitivity ( e.g. c@xmath4d@xmath4 ) and could only measure the resonant part of the cross section .",
    "all the events , which appeared at a time of flight between resonances were considered to be background .",
    "the neutron scatter background was not measured , because it was assumed to be negligible .",
    "however , as it turned out , this method works fine only if the capture - to - scatter cross section ratio is not too small and the required uncertainties are on the order of 10% . for higher accuracies or less favorable cases ,",
    "a better method is to detect all the @xmath0-rays emitted during an event @xcite .",
    "this means using detector material with higher gamma as well as neutron sensitivity .",
    "the number of events due to captures of scattered neutrons in the detection system will therefore be increased . but this method has the advantage that neutron captures on different isotopes , in particular on the sample and detector / structure materials , can be discriminated on the basis of the total energy released , or the so - called q - value .",
    "further background reduction might be necessary because of an unfavorable signal to background ratio .",
    "applying appropriate cuts on total energy and multiplicity can therefore lead to a much improved signal - to - background ratio .",
    "additionally , the significantly higher detection efficiency of such setups allows the use of smaller samples .",
    "background due to @xmath0-rays ( 3b ) , which are produced at the neutron production site or from neutron capture on beam line components , can arrive at the sample position at the same time of flight as the neutrons under investigation . without a sample in the beam , these gammas would not be detected , but since they interact with the sample ( mainly via compton - scattering and pair production ) , secondary gammas will be detected .",
    "obviously this background scales with the sample size .",
    "most of the @xmath0-rays produced have energies below 3  mev and the energy deposition in a calorimetric detection system will therefore be much smaller than for the reactions under investigation .    additionally , events due to scattered high - energy neutrons at earlier times might appear during the tof - window under investigation , since most of the neutrons will be moderated before the final capture .",
    "disentangling between ( 3a ) and ( 3b ) is therefore a challenge for modern high accuracy ( n,@xmath0 ) experiments .",
    "this report describes the attempts of the dance collaboration to identify and suppress different background components during the different commissioning phases .",
    "dance is designed as a high efficiency , highly segmented 4@xmath1 baf@xmath3 detector for calorimetrically detecting @xmath0-rays following a neutron capture .",
    "the initial design work is described in @xcite . for practical reasons the detector modules",
    "do not really cover the entire solid angle .",
    "the design of the detector is such that a full 4@xmath1 array would consist of 162 crystals of four different shapes , each shape covering the same solid angle @xcite .",
    "two of the 162 crystals are left out in order to leave space for the neutron beam pipe .",
    "depending on the experiment , one crystal can be replaced by a sample changer mechanism , which makes it possible to exchange up to 3  samples without closing the beam shutter and breaking the vacuum of the beam pipe .",
    "thus the full array is designed to host 159 or 160 out of 162 possible baf@xmath3 crystals .",
    "the dimensions of the bare crystals are designed to form a baf@xmath3 shell with an inner radius of 17  cm and a thickness of 15  cm .    during the first commissioning phase of this project , from november 2002 until january 2003 ,",
    "only 147 crystals were installed in the array and only 141 were actually connected .",
    "the main part of this report concentrates on the results obtained with 141 active crystals . only sect .",
    "[ gamma_induced ] contains data taken with the full array of 159/160  crystals . in order to guide the commissioning process ,",
    "intensive simulations using the detector simulation package geant  3.21 were performed @xcite .",
    "[ fig_sim ] illustrates the conditions as they were simulated .",
    "the simulations were designed to be as close to the experimental conditions as possible .",
    "therefore , the 6 mounted crystals that were not connected were included in the simulations as passive detectors , but were not drawn in the figure in order to increase the visibility of the interior of the ball .",
    "four supporting structure pieces were also included .",
    "these pieces are welded onto the cross of the beam line inside the ball in order to increase the mechanical stability ( see top left part of fig .  [ fig_sim ] ) .",
    "the dance array is divided into two halves , left - hand side and right - hand side relative to the neutron flight direction .",
    "the position of almost all of the crystals , which were not mounted at that time , was on the equatorial ring joining the two halves .",
    "the response of the array to neutrons and gamma rays was studied using the monte carlo code geant 3.21 including the gcalor package for low energy neutron transportation @xcite .",
    "the inner radius of a closed sphere with bare crystals would be 17  cm and the crystals have a length of 15  cm .",
    "the crystals are supported by a spherical structure made of aluminum with an inner radius of 49.7  cm and an outer radius of 53.5  cm ( 1.5  inches thickness ) .",
    "each crystal is wrapped in a pvc foil of 0.7  mm thickness and glued to a photo multiplier tube ( pmt ) . in reality as well as in the simulations , the crystals had to be moved outwards by 1  cm in order to leave space for this wrapping .",
    "together with the fact that only 160  crystals can be used , the actual solid angle covered by the detector is reduced to about 3.6@xmath1 .",
    "the crystal - pmt unit was put into an aluminum housing in a way that there is no aluminum between the crystals or between crystals and sample , while the pmt is surrounded by an aluminum - housing , which was finally mounted to the surrounding supporting structure .",
    "the supporting structure as well as the aluminum housings were included in the simulations .",
    "due to restrictions in the number of defined volumes only a simplified pmt could be included .",
    "the simplification was that the material of the pmt ( mainly co and ni contained in the magnetic shielding ) was mixed into the material of the al - housings . in order to make the simulations as realistic as possible ,",
    "the beam pipe including the cross for the sample changer were included in the simulations .",
    "previous geant simulations @xcite have predicted that the background due to neutrons , which are scattered at the sample and eventually captured in the surrounding material , can be significantly reduced by a spherical @xmath5lih shell between the sample and the baf@xmath3 detectors .",
    "some measurements carried out during the commissioning phase had such a @xmath5lih moderator with an inner radius of 10.5 cm and an outer radius of 16.5  cm surrounding the target location .",
    "therefore , most of the simulations described here were done both with and without such a moderator .",
    "the simulated @xmath5lih absorber had a density of 0.85 g/@xmath6 and a isotopic composition of 100% @xmath5li .    in order to check the effect of scattered neutrons , a set of simulations including the walls of the detector cave ( made of borated polyethylene ( 5% ) ) and aluminum windows up- and",
    "downstream of the dance array has been carried out ( see section  [ time - dependent ] ) .",
    "the threshold behavior , the energy resolution and the air gap between the crystals were included in the simulations in an attempt to fit the measured spectra for various calibration source spectra .",
    "in this section a rough estimate of the expected count rate during a typical experiment will be presented .",
    "the neutron production target in the lujan center is typically irradiated by a pulsed 800  mev proton beam with an average current of 100  @xmath2a and a repetition rate of 20  hz . unless otherwise stated this section and all of the figures in the following sections assume a proton pulse of these specifications . under these conditions the neutron flux at the sample position inside dance follows approximately a 1/@xmath7 law in the neutron energy region of interest 1  ev  @xmath8  1  mev .",
    "this results in a constant number of about 3@xmath910@xmath10  s@xmath11 neutrons per energy decade , or 1.5@xmath910@xmath12 neutrons per energy decade per proton pulse .    assuming a 1/@xmath13 energy dependence for the neutron capture cross section , the neutron capture rate in the sample is expected to be constant over the duration of the neutron pulse .",
    "if the ( n,@xmath0 ) cross section is @xmath14  =  @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the number of sample atoms , the instantaneous neutron capture rate at any time during the duration of the neutron pulse would be : @xmath17 inserting typical values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( 1  mg with atomic mass 100 ) gives 1.65@xmath20 neutron capture per second , which will be detected with nearly 100% efficiency .",
    "most of the neutron capture events will cause a signal with summed @xmath0-energy of @xmath21500  kev around the q - value of the reaction . based on these assumptions an instantaneous capture rate of @xmath22",
    "s@xmath11 distributed over a @xmath0-energy range of 1  mev will be used for comparison with the achieved background levels in later sections .",
    "time - independent background is not correlated with the time structure of the neutron beam . in our case",
    "natural radioactivity , the intrinsic radioactivity of the baf@xmath3 detectors and that of a radioactive sample have to be considered .",
    "natural @xmath0-activity , like @xmath23k and @xmath24tl , with @xmath0-ray energies of 1465  kev and 2615  kev , respectively , can be discriminated from neutron capture events using information about the gamma energy deposited in the detector .",
    "the neutron binding energy is above 5  mev for most of the isotopes under investigation , which is well separated from the typical @xmath0-ray energies of natural decays .",
    "this means that most of the events due to neutron capture on the sample appear at much higher channels in the sum energy spectrum . as it will become clearer in later sections , it is still desirable to understand and - ideally - reduce or discriminate those lower - energy background components by other means than the energy information .",
    "the main reason for that is the fact that dance does not have a 100% detection efficiency for @xmath0-rays and consequently a significant part of the ( n,@xmath0 ) events deposit therefore less energy than the q - value . for high accuracy measurements ,",
    "this low energy tail of the energy distribution needs to be well understood and , if possible , measured with low background .",
    "the intrinsic radioactivity of the baf@xmath3 crystals originates from the @xmath25-decay chain of the chemical homologue @xmath26ra , see fig .",
    "[ fig_a_bkgd ] .",
    "typical activities are 0.2  bq/@xmath6 material @xcite .",
    "most of the crystals used for dance show an intrinsic @xmath25-activity between 150 and 250  hz .",
    "the scintillation light of baf@xmath3 crystals has a short ( @xmath27  0.6  ns ) and a long ( @xmath27  0.6  @xmath2s ) component .",
    "the intensity ratio between the two components is radiation type dependent , which allows for particle identification if both components are measured . while the emitted @xmath25-particles deposit their energy almost exclusively through the slow component , about 10% of the energy of the @xmath0-rays feeds the fast component .",
    "therefore a comparison of the fast and slow component integrals provides a powerful tool to reject the background due to @xmath25-activity . in our experiment",
    "each baf@xmath3 signal is recorded with waveform digitizers ( acqiris corp .",
    ", model dc-265 ) and integrated with two different integration times , each matching either the short or the long decay time .",
    "[ fig_pid ] shows the results of this method applied to a run carried out with a @xmath28co calibration source in the center of the dance array .",
    "applying appropriate cuts results in an almost complete suppression of the @xmath25-background .",

[ fig_bg ] ) .",

    "all other decays either release energies below 100  kev or are not yet in equilibrium , since @xmath33pb with a half life of 22.3  years acts as a bottle neck in the decay chain . in order to confirm these decays as the cause of the observed background ,",

    "the installation of a @xmath5lih absorber between sample and detector sphere reduces the background from scattered neutrons significantly .",
    "although reducing the peak efficiency the use of this absorber shell clearly improves the signal to background ratio .",
    "gamma induced background will be further investigated , since it is shown to be an important component .",
    "starting in summer 2003 neutron capture measurements on a number of stable as well as unstable isotopes have been successfully carried out the dance .",
    "the analysis of these experiments is in progress .",
