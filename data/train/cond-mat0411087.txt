    "exciton  polaritons are the basic optical excitations of any semiconductor system .",
    "the interband optical polarization of a semiconductor is never an isolated degree of freedom . rather , the exciton states are always coupled to the electromagnetic field via the linear radiation  matter interaction hamiltonian . exciton",
    " polaritons are the resulting eigenmodes of the maxwell equations coupled to the material equations describing the excitons in a semiconductor structure .",
    "the polariton concept in bulk semiconductors was first introduced by hopfield @xcite .",
    "bulk exciton ",
    "polaritons are mixed modes of one exciton and one photon mode having the same momentum , as imposed by translational invariance .",
    "this one  to  one selection rule results into a strong mixing and an energy  dispersion displaying the anticrossing typical of normal  mode coupling @xcite . in gaas , the normal ",
    "mode splitting at resonance is 16 mev , larger than the exciton binding energy .    in systems with reduced dimensionality , such as quantum wells and quantum wires ,",
    "the partial breaking of the translational symmetry allows coupling of excitons to a continuum of photon modes .",
    "the polariton picture is consequently modified and a polariton becomes a resonance of a discrete exciton state linearly coupled to a photon continuum , analogously to a fano resonance @xcite . in this case",
    "the importance of the coupling , expressed by the magnitude of the polariton self  energy correction to the bare exciton energy , is considerably smaller . in quantum wells @xcite",
    ", the polariton resonance implies a finite exciton radiative lifetime which is of the order of 10 ps in typical gaas quantum wells , and a negligible shift of the exciton energy .",
    "a similar effect is predicted in quantum wires @xcite .    when the dimensionality of the electromagnetic field is also reduced , e.g. in semiconductor planar microcavities , the one  to  one coupling typical of a bulk semiconductor is recovered and strongly  coupled polaritons with full exciton ",
    "photon mixing characterize the optical spectrum @xcite .",
    "the question naturally arises , whether the polariton concept is of some relevance in the case of quantum dots ( qds ) , where the electron  hole system is fully confined in the three spatial dimensions . in this case we might distinguish between two effects of the radiation ",
    "matter coupling .",
    "the first is the self  energy of a single qd coupled to the electromagnetic field , resulting in a finite radiative lifetime and an energy shift of the qd levels .",
    "this effect is well established and several theoretical estimates of the radiative lifetime of qds have been proposed in the past years @xcite . the second is the radiative coupling between different qds .",
    "this process might be depicted as a multiple emission and reabsorption of a photon by qds in a many  qd system , eventually giving rise to collective modes of several qds .",
    "this picture implies that the exciton state of a single qd is no longer an eigenstate and excitation of one exciton in a qd would result in a transfer of excitation to other qds , similar to a system of coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "a similar effect has already been suggested and theoretically characterized in the case of quantum well excitons localized by interface disorder @xcite .",
    "the excitation transfer mechanisms between polarizable systems such as molecules or semiconductor qds are usually grouped into two categories , depending on whether they occur via overlapping wave functions of the spatially separated systems or via long  range interactions .",
    "the propotype of these latter case is the electrostatic dipole ",
    "dipole interaction , frequently referred to as _ frster energy transfer _ @xcite .",
    "as an example , the frster rate for the excitation transfer between two qds has been estimated @xcite in the range of @xmath0 to @xmath1 for inp qds with interdot distance of 7 nm .",
    "this mechanism has been experimentally characterized in the case of closely spaced qd systems @xcite . the important feature of the frster mechanism , however , is the dependence of the transfer rate on the distance .",
    "being a dipole ",
    "dipole type interaction , its rate within fermi golden rule is proportional to the fourth power of the dipole moment matrix element and decays as the sixth power of the distance @xcite . on a more general ground , in addition to the original frster scheme",
    ", all excitation transfer mechanisms based on electromagnetic interaction are expected to be of some importance .",
    "the polariton mechanism that we address here involves an excitation transfer mediated by the transverse electromagnetic field . within a perturbation picture , which considers only one emission  absorption process",
    ", this mechanism results in the transfer of electron  hole excitation between distant qds mediated by the emission and reabsorption of a propagating photon .",
    "the coupling strength of this process is therefore expected to be small , if compared to other proposed coupling mechanisms which involve tunneling of the electron ",
    "hole wave function @xcite , or even to the frster mechanism at short distance .",
    "this is basically due to the small absorption cross section of typical semiconductor qds .",
    "however , the polariton coupling is also expected to have a long spatial range , of the order of a few photon wavelengths .",
    "its rate turns out to be proportional to the square of the dipole moment matrix element and decays as the inverse of the distance , as the transfer is mediated by a propagating field in two dimensions .",
    "in addition , as for the frster mechanism , it requires that the two energy levels involved in the excitation transfer have resonant spectra .",
    "although , as it will turn out , typical transfer rates derived here are in the range of @xmath2 to @xmath3 , because of its spatial range the mechanism we study must be considered as complementary to the frster coupling . in particular",
    "this long  range coupling might play an important role in the increasingly sought applications of qds in quantum information processing @xcite . in presence of radiative interaction , in fact , even very distant qds can not be considered as isolated systems .    in this work , in order to describe the radiative coupling mechanism , we develop a full maxwell  schrdinger formalism for a system of many qds coupled to the electromagnetic field .",
    "we model a qd having cylindrical shape and compute the ground electron  hole pair state within the effective mass scheme .",
    "we numerically solve the maxwell equations for the electromagnetic field coupled to the polarization field of a qd ensemble , in order to compute the polariton resonances of the system .",
    "the linear susceptibility is obtained by means of the standard linear response theory .",
    "we initially address the case of two qds and inspect how the coupling depends on the detuning and the mutual qd distance .",
    "afterwards , we consider a system of many qds randomly distributed on a plane and we determine the eigenenergies of the coupled equations .",
    "the collective modes of the system display modified radiative lifetimes , some of them being strongly _ sub  radiant _ or _ super  radiant _ with respect to the bare qds lifetime .",
    "this is analogous to the case of polaritons in multiple quantum wells @xcite , although the qds in our case are randomly distributed in space rather than ordered in a superlattice .",
    "we apply our model to the realistic cases of stranski  krastanov  grown inas qds and cdse qds resulting from interface fluctuations in narrow quantum wells . in the cdse case the effect of radiative coupling is sizeable and a considerable number of collective modes have lifetimes about twice as long or short than the uncoupled case .",

    "ii , starting form the maxwell equations and a linear non - local susceptibility , we analitically derive the eigenmode equations that holds in presence of radiative coupling . sec .",
    "iii contains the results of the numerical diagonalization of the problem in the cases of two and many ",

    "iv we present some concluding remarks",
    ". finally , appendix a contains the details of the qd model used to derive the electron ",
    "hole pair wave functions that were used in this work , while appendix b contains the detailed derivation of the radiative coupling tensor between two qds .",
    "the semiclassical model of qd interband excitation in interaction with the electromagnetic field is based on the solution of the maxwell equations coupled to a nonlocal linear susceptibility which accounts for the interband optical transition .",
    "this is done in full analogy with the polariton formalism in bulk semiconductors and heterostructures  @xcite .",
    "we restrict in what follows to the transition between the semiconductor ground state and the ground electron ",

    "it is reasonable to assume  @xcite that for strongly confined systems the coulomb correlation induces only a moderate quantitative change in the optical transition probability amplitude . given the very simple description of the qd in this work , this quantitative effect can be accounted for by adjusting the interband matrix element in order to reproduce e.g. the single ",

    "it is therefore possible to analytically solve the uncoupled z  component of the maxwell equations and to effectively reduce to a two  dimensional problem . in this planar geometry",
    "there are two independent states of the interband polarization vector , that correspond to excitons with spins oriented along the x and y  direction , respectively . by using simple lorentz resonances in ( [ chi ] )",
    ", we assume that the nonradiative lineshape of each qd is a dirac delta function .",
    "recently it was found that non  perturbative coupling of the exciton with acoustic phonons is responsible for a broad phonon  assisted contribution to the nonradiative qd lineshape @xcite .",
    "however , at low temperatures the phonon  assisted part of the line tends to be small , especially for low quantum confinement .",
    "the zero  phonon part of the line on the other hand is only affected by the so called `` pure dephasing '' . it has been recently shown that pure dephasing in qds is almost exclusively due to the radiative recombination rate @xcite which is also an outcome of the present approach .",

    "most of the qds fall in this energy region and consequently small values of the detuning are more likely to occur .    , but for gaas qds with @xmath95 and a physical density of 1000  qds/@xmath86 . in this case radiative shifts up to one order of magnitude larger than in the case of inas qds are obtained as an effect of the coupling.,width=302 ]    for different materials , one can observe larger radiative coupling effects . in fig .",
    "[ cdse ] we show the histogram obtained for a cdse qd sample .",
    "the physical parameters for this case are a spatial density of 1000  qds/@xmath86 and a dipole matrix element value of @xmath95 .",
    "once again the histogram results from many realization of the sample , with randomly distributed qds , having ramdomly gauss  distributed size . in this case",
    "the deviation from the noninteracting case is more pronounced because of the higher qd density and of the larger dipole matrix element @xmath5 .",
    "a radiative shift of a few @xmath83ev is achieved , that is one order of magnitude larger with respect to the case of inas qds . in this case , some of the collective modes have vanishing radiative rates , showing how the radiative coupling can profoundly change the dephasing rates of many qd systems .",
    "we have shown that qds in a sample can not in principle be considered as isolated systems .",
    "the radiative coupling between qds causes the emergence of collective modes . by comparing their lifetimes with the ones of the excited state of an isolated qd",
    ", we can classify these modes into sub  radiant and super  radiant .",
    "we find the effect on the radiative decay  rate to be of the order of 1  @xmath83ev .",
    "this effect strongly depends on the dipole matrix element of the material that constitutes the qds and on their spatial density . for a very dense qd sample",
    "this effect should be observable as a non  exponential decay of the photoluminescence signal . despite its small size",
    ", the addressed mechanism acts over wavelength distance , so that two qds that are a few hundreds of nanometers far from each other can radiatively interact .",
    "semiconductor qds are being increasingly advertised as the ideal building blocks of the future technology for quantum information processing .",
    "these proposals are often based on pairs of identical qds @xcite or on pairs of qds in which a degeneracy occurs between different excited levels @xcite and often take advantage of excitation transfer processes . moreover , it is likely that a solid state implementation of a quantum information system would be constituted of a great number of ( nearly ) identical , independent quantum gates , possibly located at submicron distance from each other .",
    "in all these situations where levels of different qds are nearly degenerate , our result shows that excitation transfer by radiative coupling can occur over long distances .",
    "the radiative coupling mechanism that we describe might therefore be relevant in determining the excitation transfer dynamics of these systems .",
    "we are grateful to a. quattropani , p. schwendimann , and r. zimmermann for fruitful discussions .",
    "we acknowledge financial support from the swiss national foundation through project n. 620 - 066060 .",
    "due to the symmetry of the problem , in the following we will consider a cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "plane radius of the cylindrical qd is @xmath15 , and its height in the @xmath39direction is @xmath16 .",
    "the effective mass hamiltonian operator which describes the carrier ( electron or hole ) in the qd is @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the effective mass of the carrier and @xmath99 describes the band profile for the qd , that is @xmath100    three assumptions allow to simplify the problem : ( i ) we assume that the problem is separable , namely the wave  function can be written as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a positive integer representing the azimuthal quantum number ; ( ii ) we assume that the effective mass of the carrier is the same in the qd and in the surrounding medium ; ( iii ) we rewrite the hamiltonian operator as @xmath103 with @xmath104 @xmath105 is considered as a small perturbation , because it is nonzero only in regions of space where the @xmath15 and @xmath39confined wave  functions assume very small values .    by neglecting @xmath105 ,",
    "the problem becomes separable . in the @xmath39direction we reduce to the problem of the one  dimensional square potential . because of the symmetry of the problem , we find both even and odd solutions .",
    "the even solution is @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 is a normalization factor .",
    "the conditions of continuity of the solution and of its derivative require that @xmath31 verifies the equation @xmath109    the odd solution is @xmath110 in this case imposing the continuity at the qd boundaries implies @xmath111 eqs .",
    "[ cont_1 ] and [ cont_2 ] result in a discretization of the wave vector , which will be labeled by @xmath112 .",
    "the radial part of the scrdinger equation takes the form of a bessel equation @xmath113 solutions of this equation are the bessel functions . in the qd",
    "the wave function must be well defined at @xmath114 , while outside of the qd we look for exponentially decaying solutions , as required for a confined state .",
    "these requirements are satisfied by first kind bessel functions and first hankel functions with imaginary argument , respectively .",
    "we obtain @xmath115 where @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 is a normalization factor .",
    "the conditions of continuity are achieved if @xmath119 satisfies the equation @xmath120 resulting in the discretization of @xmath119 , which we label by @xmath121 .",
    "the problem has therefore three quantum numbers , namely @xmath121 , @xmath102 and @xmath112 .",
    "we have evaluated , at the first order of perturbation , the error introduced by neglecting @xmath105 .",
