    "empirical scaling laws built using the main structural parameters of galaxies such as characteristic radii , mean surface brightnesses , and central velocity dispersions , have become quite fashionable in the last decade . in particular , the relations holding for early - type galaxies are believed to be useful tools for the understanding of the structure , formation , and evolution of the kinematically hot stellar systems ( hereafter early - type galaxies ) , and to be also quite accurate distance indicators ( dis ) for these objects .",
    "one of such relations is the so - called fundamental plane ( hereafter fp ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ) , which , in its original formulation , binds the central velocity dispersion , @xmath9 , and the average surface brightness within the effective isophote ( that encircling half of the total light of a galaxy in a given photometric band ) , , to the mean radius of this same isophote , named effective radius @xmath10 : @xmath11 .",
    "a second scaling law is the  relation ( dressler  1987 ) : @xmath12 , where  is the diameter of the circular aperture within which the average corrected surface brightness equals a fixed value usually 20.75 , and @xmath13 is a constant of the order of @xmath14 . to a first order approximation the relation is an edge - on view of the fp ( dressler  1987 ) . in this case",
    "the surface brightness parameter is hidden in the definition of .",
    "the slope and the small thickness measured for the fp and the  relations imply a narrow range of density structure , velocity anisotropy , and mean age among elliptical galaxies , which are excellent properties for dis .",
    "actually these relations have provided much of the present information on the large scale flows in the local universe ( lynden - bell  1988 ) .",
    "two complementary strategies have been developed .",
    "on the one hand the enormous progress in the observational techniques and data reduction procedures has produced larger and larger samples and increasingly better distance determinations of galaxies .",
    "on the other hand much effort has been put in the last years in quantifying internal errors , biases , calibration uncertainties , second parameter corrections , environmental influences , and behaviour of the residuals in both relations ; see  lucey ( 1991a ; b = lgct ) , jacoby  ( 1992 ) , jrgensen  ( 1992 ; = jfk , 1995a , b ) , davies  ( 1993 ) , saglia  ( 1993 ) , van albada ( 1993 ) . in conclusion , from the original 32% uncertainty given by the faber & jackson ( 1976 ; ) relation , the error has been progressively reduced by the coming of the  and of the fp relations , being nowadays as low as 10% in the relative distances between clusters ( jacoby  1992 ) .    despite this success , a number of problems are still open . which of the two relations ,  and fp , is more suiteable as di ? or , in other words , which of the two is less affected by observational errors and biases ?",
    "can s0 galaxies be included in these relations ?",
    "many papers have addressed the above questions with contradictory results .",
    "jfk state that the fp should be preferred , because the  relation has a larger scatter and suffers from a surface brightness bias .",
    "van albada  ( 1993 ) find that the  relation has the same accuracy of the fp , provided that a proper surface brightness correction is applied .",
    "lucey  ( 1991a ) and lgct derive contradictory evidences for such a bias in their samples , and saglia  ( 1993 ) show that the scatter around both relations can be reduced by rejecting e galaxies with inner disk components .",
    "finally , davies  ( 1993 ) point out that only galaxies in a restricted range of surface brightness should be used in the relation in order to avoid contaminations .",
    "we argue here that the  and the fp relations have substantially the same accuracy  at least as long as the distance to nearby clusters is concerned  by applying them to the measure of the relative distances to the fornax and coma clusters with respect to virgo .",
    "the motivation of this work is twofold .",
    "firstly , the relative distances to these clusters are far from being accurately known ( cf . section  [ sec2 ] ) , and secondly , today we can exploit an accurate and homogeneous data - set of photometric and spectroscopic measurements for the galaxies of these three clusters : caon  ( 1990 , 1994 , hereafter ) , donofrio ( 1995 ) , lgct , jfk , and jrgensen  ( 1995a , b ) .",
    "the study of a volume - limited sample of galaxies has the advantage that one can look at the intrinsic properties of the and fp relations by means of objects which are probably coeval , and reduce as much as possible the principal sources of errors , in particular those related to the unknown distances of the galaxies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] reviews the current determinations of the relative distances to the virgo , fornax , and coma clusters , as measured by the relevant dis .",
    "our determinations of the relative distances to the three clusters using the  and fp relations are presented in sections  [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] respectively , together with a discussion of the errors intrinsic to both methods and a comparison of the results with other dis . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    "we analyze the behaviour of the residuals of the  and fp relations by exploiting the advantage of our volume - limited , accurate , and homogeneous ( in the methodological approach and in the data analysis ) sample of galaxies , and we perform some further tests on the  relation by varying the definitions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in section  [ sec6 ]",
    "we present the  relation used as di for the fornax cluster .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec7 ] .",
    "in his review of the extragalactic distance scale ,  ( 1993 ) showed that the differential distance modulus ( ) between the fornax and the virgo cluster is , on average , @xmath17 and @xmath18 mag for the _ long _ and for the _ short _ distance scale respectively .",
    "in other words , according to this study , both scales place virgo closer than fornax .",
    "the trend is not confirmed by all dis .",
    "table  1 lists the measurements of @xmath19 , sorted according to the method used ; we have essentially ignored the old measurements , already revisited by .",
    "a quick look to the table shows that the inner ring diameters of spirals , the globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) , the surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) , the  relation , the ir tully  fisher relation ( ) , and the scale length of de galaxies , place the fornax cluster closer than virgo , in marked contrast with the results from the brightest cluster members ( bcm ) , the  relation , the planetary nebulae luminosity function ( pnlf ) , and the sne  ia .",

    "does it exist a `` representative '' sample of early - type galaxies in clusters providing unbiased distance determinations ?",
    "can s0 galaxies be included in the and fp relations ? which are the `` best '' parameters to use ?",
    "for instance , shall we use the effective radius  derived from a model  dependent fit to the light profiles ( e.g.  law ) , rather than the radius of the isophote which encircles half the total luminosity , whatever the light profile be ?",
    "shall we choose the central velocity dispersion @xmath9 or an average within a given radial range ?",
    "is it better suited the diameter  at @xmath73 or the diameter relative to a different mean surface brightness level ?",
    "we have no clear answers to any of such questions yet .",
    "unfortunately , the accuracy and homogeneity of the spectroscopic data is still low compared with those of photometric data .",
    "extended rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles do exist for a few galaxies only ( usually the brightest ones ) , and in most cases the full velocity field of the objects is poorly known .",
    "systematic and/or random differences in the velocity dispersion measurements are easily found in the literature for the same objects and likely arise from the use of different methods of data reduction ( fourier quotient , cross correlation , fourier correlation quotient , etc . ) and to the corrections for the aperture size effects ( jrgensen  1995b ) .",
    "presently the virgo , fornax , and coma clusters offer the best studied galaxy samples for addressing the above questions , since the available data approximately satisfy the required criteria of homogeneity and accuracy needed for the analysis of these problems .",
    "the  set of b - band photometric parameters for virgo e and non - barred s0 galaxies is 80% complete down to @xmath74 mag ( according to the catalog of binggeli , 1985 , hereafter bst ) , and that of fornax is 100% complete down to @xmath75 mag ( according to the membership list of ferguson , 1989 ) . assuming the same distance of 18.3 mpc to both clusters , the samples are respectively complete ( and volume - limited ) down to @xmath76 and @xmath77 mag .",
    "the  diameters , effective radii , and effective mean surface brightnesses , are given by  with an accuracy of about 5% , 20% , and @xmath78 mag ( @xmath79 ) respectively .",
    "the above parameters have not been corrected for seeing , galactic absorption , internal extinction and redshift .",
    "all these corrections are very small for the galaxies in both clusters , as explained in .    for the photometric parameters of the coma galaxies we made use of the data of lgct , jfk , and jrgensen  ( 1995a ) , which have a similar degree of homogeneity and accuracy as .",
    "these data have been corrected by the authors for the above cited effects .",
    "unfortunately , the spectroscopic data are far less homogeneous .",
    "we have measured the rotation curves @xmath80 and velocity dispersion profiles @xmath81 of 15 galaxies of the  fornax sample ( donofrio  1995 ) , while for the virgo galaxies we collected central velocity dispersion measurements from the literature : whitmore  ( 1985 , wmt ) , dalle ore  ( 1991 , dfjs ) , davoust  ( 1985 , dpv ) , faber ( 1989 , 7-sam ) , mcelroy ( 1995 ) . for the virgo cluster",
    "we were able to find kinematical data for 12 galaxies only ( 10 e and 2 s0 ) : ngc4374 , 4486 , 4636 ( davies & birkinshaw 1988 ) , ngc4365 , 4621 ( bender 1988a , b ) , ngc4387 , 4478 ( davies  1983 ) , ngc4406 , 4472 , 4649 ( franx  1989 ) , ngc4459 ( peterson 1978 ) and ngc4473 ( young  1978 ) .",
    "for the galaxies of the coma cluster we used the central velocity dispersions quoted by lgct , jfk ( who homogeneized the data of faber  1989 and dressler 1987 ) , and jrgensen  ( 1995b , who increased the jfk sample and obtained average velocity dispersions from a fixed and a variable , within @xmath82 , aperture of the slit ) .",
    "the accuracy of the kinematical data is more difficult to evaluate .",
    "much of the offset in the distance determinations are likely caused by systematic differences in the @xmath16 measurements .",
    "such differences are difficult to evaluate due to the heterogenous nature of the samples and of the methods adopted to gauge the central velocity dispersion .    according to jacoby  ( 1992 ) the errors on @xmath16 likely range between 6 and 14% .",
    "it is clear that such an estimate does not account for possible local deviations from the overall dynamical behaviour due for instance to singularities , which may cause the appearance of central spikes in the velocity dispersion profile ( which behave as systematic errors on @xmath16 ) .    of the 52 early  type galaxies in the virgo sample ( 29 s0 and 23 e ) , 13 s0s and 4",

    "one galaxy ( ngc4370 ) has been eliminated because its central surface brightness is fainter than @xmath73 ( implying @xmath85 ) . in fornax",
    "we have 12 s0s and 16 es : 7 s0s and 7 es have no measurements of @xmath9 , and 2 s0s have @xmath86 .",

    "the upper panel shows only the virgo galaxies , with different symbols according to their morphology : open circles for es and triangles for s0s . here",
    "the central velocity dispersions of the virgo galaxies are the plain averages of the data found in the literature .",
    "it is apparent that e and s0 galaxies follow the same relation .",
    "there are , however , 8 virgo galaxies that largely deviate from the mean relation ( indicated by the solid line ; see below ) .",
    "the discrepant galaxies have peculiar redshifts and/or high inclination to the line of sight .",
    "three of them have @xmath83  and , following the recipe of the 7-sam have been discarded . of the 9 s0s that follow the mean relation , 3 have apparent flattening higher than s0(5 ) ( according to the bst classification ) and one of them has a peculiar redshift .",
    "two galaxies fitting the mean relation are rounder than s0(5 ) but have discrepant redshifts .",
    "therefore it seems that inclination and redshift do not determine univocally the galaxies that follow the  relation and are not useful selection criteria for establishing a `` representative '' sample .",
    "table  3a presents the morphological type , the axis ratio , the recession velocity and the bst membership code for the virgo galaxies which deviate significantly from the mean  relation , and table  3b the same data for those s0s that instead fit the relation . in the following",
    "we will reject the 8 discrepant galaxies when computing the  and fp relations ( the same galaxies , with the possible exception of ngc4200 , also show a large scatter with respect to the fp ) ; they are likely foreground and background objects .    the solid line in fig .",

    "one might speculate that the small scatter of the virgo data is due to the averaging of several measurements of @xmath16 , obtained by different authors using different methods of data analysis on spectra taken with different slit apertures .",
    "what does it happen if we do not average the central velocity dispersion measurements ?",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ tutti ] where , for each source of @xmath9 data , we report the slope , intercept , and  scatter of the best fit for the corresponding virgo galaxies and the resulting  computed adopting the slope derived for virgo .",
    "this experiment tells us two things .",
    "the first is that the small scatter of the virgo data is independent of the databases ( each catalog of velocity dispersions is made of averaged and homogenized data ) . if we use , however , the 12 galaxies of the sub - sample with the best observed rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles , the  scatter from the best fit increases to 0.08 ( 20% ) .",
    "the second is that the relative distance moduli between the two clusters span a large interval , varying with the properties of the adopted virgo sample .",
    "the null value of  found in our comparison with pierce ( 1989 ) demonstrates this effect .",
    "since most of the virgo data come from the 7-sam sample , we decided to concentrate on the errors introduced by the aperture sizes on the relative distance between virgo and fornax , adopting the central velocity dispersions of their lick and lco - hi measurements ( @xmath103 and @xmath104 slit aperture respectively ) .",
    "the two data - sets for precisely the same galaxies , give  @xmath105 0.35 and 0.55 respectively .",
    "this means that an accurate distance between the clusters could be obtained only after an homogenous comparison of the @xmath16 measurements , corrected for the aperture size effects .",
    "a more quantitative idea of such corrections has been provided by jrgensen  ( 1995b ) .",
    "finally , we calculate the distance between fornax and virgo through the @xmath106 relation using the  @xmath107-magnitudes for the galaxies of the two clusters and the velocity dispersions from the catalog of mcelroy ( 1995 ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath108 mag , in good agreement with the  relation .",
    "we used the data given by lgct , jfk and jrgensen  ( 1995a , b ) to derive the distance to the coma cluster .",
    "unfortunately , the  diameters measured by lgct are in the @xmath109 band ( instead of @xmath107 ) , at the mean surface brightness level of 19.8 . however , since the average @xmath110 colour of elliptical galaxies is approximately constant and equal to 0.95 mag , we can equally compare the two data sets .",
    "the same happens for the  values of jrgensen  ( 1995a ) which are in the @xmath111 band . in that case , using the photometric parameters in the @xmath107 and @xmath111 bands listed in jfk , we derived the relations : @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",

    "considering a 5% aperture correction to the observed @xmath9 passing from the virgo and coma galaxies ( as in davies  1987 ) ,  turns out to be @xmath116 mag .",
    "we note that the use of the lgct seeing corrected parameters does not influence very much the final result .",
    "we also calculated the relative distance between coma and virgo using the photometric parameters and the coma velocity dispersions quoted by jrgensen  ( 1995b ) , who give the average @xmath16 within a fixed aperture of @xmath117 and within a variable aperture @xmath118 , which is connected to the physical size of the galaxies .",
    "it was impossible for us to get the same variables for the virgo galaxies , since this requires the velocity dispersion profiles .",
    "we found @xmath119 and 3.55 mag respectively in the two cases , confirming the 12 - 15% distance uncertainty due to aperture effects .",
    "since the @xmath118 aperture is generally lower than the @xmath117 slit for the coma galaxies , we conclude that , by enlarging the aperture , one obtains a lower average value of @xmath16 and consequently a lower differential distance modulus .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the  results with the @xmath120 relation of dressler ( 1984 , hereafter ad ) , who found @xmath121 mag .",
    "his result is particularly important here because dressler considered two different slit apertures for the galaxies in virgo and coma in order to reduce as much as possible the aperture effect .",
    "the @xmath122 mag difference of the two methods can be explained either by a systematic difference in  ( 15% ) or in @xmath9 ( 10% ) .",
    "we first compared the magnitudes of the virgo galaxies in common with dressler ( he used the data of sandage & visvanathan 1978 ) .",
    "> from the growth curves of the  sample , we derived the @xmath123 magnitudes of our galaxies , and compared them with dressler s data by transforming his @xmath61 magnitudes in the @xmath124band .",
    "we adopted the color equation of sandage & visvanathan ( 1978 ) : @xmath125 .",
    "we obtained @xmath126 .",
    "being only a zero point offset in the @xmath107 magnitudes , the resulting @xmath127 relation for the virgo - coma galaxies produces a  of 3.80 .",
    "unfortunately , dressler does not report the  of his galaxies , and so a definitive comparison can not be made .",
    "however , when we compared our data with dressler s  ( 1987 ) , we found a good agreement . this is an indication that the observed discrepancy is not due to a systematic variation of the photometric parameters .",
    "the discrepancy between the  and the @xmath128 relations can also be due to a systematic @xmath129 offset in the velocity dispersions .",
    "part of this offset ( @xmath130 ) has been found by lgct in their comparison with the data of dressler ( unfortunately however , such a correction to the @xmath16 values of dressler brings the result of the @xmath131 relation to @xmath132 ) . by comparing the central velocity dispersions of the coma galaxies from lgct , dressler ( 1984 ) , and mcelroy ( 1995 , hereafter mce ) , we found @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "for the virgo galaxies we made the comparisons between dressler ( 1984 ) , mcelroy ( 1995 ) and davoust  ( 1985 , herefater dpv ) obtaining @xmath135 and @xmath136 ( note that the dpv data have been homogeneized by the authors taking into account aperture effects , method of reduction , etc . ) .",
    "this means that the aperture effects can account for the observed difference .",
    "the large differential distance modulus is likely the result of the low central velocity dispersion that dressler got for the virgo galaxies .",
    "looking at the data of the 7-sam and of dpv , we discovered that in the @xmath137 of the cases the use of a small aperture ( slit width over face on corrected diameter @xmath138 less than 0.02 ) produces an higher central velocity dispersion ( @xmath139 ) , where the subscripts here stay for `` large aperture '' and `` small aperture '' .",
    "this effect can be easily responsible of the scatter observed in , since it gives @xmath14015% difference in the central velocity dispersions .",
    "a further possible explanation of the difference between the @xmath106 and  relation resides in the surface brightness bias which affects the @xmath106 relation . to test this effect",
    "we corrected the total @xmath107 magnitudes of the galaxies adopting the relation @xmath141 , which represents the trend of the residuals as a function of the effective surface brightness in our data .",
    "the result is that we obtain a change in the slope and in the scatter of the @xmath142 relation , but the differential modulus is not affected .",
    "the distance to coma derived here is in conclusion slightly smaller than the results of other dis .",
    "the responsibility of this difference is likely in the adopted values of the central velocity dispersions . within the uncertainty , however , the adopted value is in good agreement with the b  band tf relation ( fukugita  1993 ) , with the  relation of dressler  ( 1987 ) , with the sn ",
    "ia ( capaccioli  1990 ) , and with bower  ( 1992 ) , who used a combination of three methods : cm diagram , colour - diameter relation , and fj relation .",
    "another possible source of error , discussed by lgct and lucey  ( 1991a ) , is the surface brightness bias which may affect the  relation of the coma galaxies .",
    "such a bias is evident in the lgct data looking at the residuals of the  relation for the galaxies in the central region of the coma cluster with respect to those in the outer parts .",
    "we checked the influence of this bias on  by selecting objects in the core of the cluster and outside , but we did not find any significant difference between the two samples .",
    "since aperture effects play a major role in determining the measured central velocity dispersion , we perform another test to better investigate this problem .    in fig.[aperture ]",
    "( bottom panel ) we plot the difference between the velocity dispersion values for the same galaxy measured through two apertures of different radius @xmath143 ( small and large slit apertures ) versus the aperture size increment in units of the galaxy effective radius .",
    "the data are for the virgo galaxies : the velocity dispersions have been measured from slit widths of @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 and are taken from the 7-sam and dressler ( 1984 ) samples . the solid line represents a fit obtained for the galaxies of our fornax sample . for each galaxy",
    "we calculate the difference between the central velocity dispersion and the luminosity weighted velocity dispersions within increasing fractions of the effective radius .",
    "the average values for 13 galaxies can be fitted by the relation : @xmath147 with a correlation coefficient of 0.97 and a rms of 2.57 .",
    "the upper panel reports the data presented in the catalog of davoust ( 1985 ) . here",
    "the authors listed the width of the slit normalized to the corrected face - on diameter of the galaxies @xmath138 .",
    "the figure shows that when the difference among the apertures is larger than @xmath148 , the value of @xmath16 obtained through the small aperture is systematically larger than that given by the large slit .",
    "it should be emphasized that for the smaller galaxies this effect is much more evident ( the slit covers a larger fraction of the effective radius ) .",
    "the scatter around zero at smaller @xmath149 is possibly explained by the 10 - 15% error of the individual measurements , but it may have also another explanation . according to ciotti  ( 1996 ) and ciotti & lanzoni ( 1996 ) , the projected central velocity dispersion depends on the fraction of effective radius of the galaxy covered by the slit width and on the surface brightness distribution of the galaxy as whole .",
    "the ratio of the central to the virial @xmath16 as a function of @xmath150 has approximately a gaussian shape , with a peak centered between @xmath151 .",
    "the shape and position of the peak depend on the exponent @xmath8 of the @xmath152 law , which best fits the light distribution of early - type galaxies ( caon  1993 ) .",
    "when @xmath8 is greater than 4 , the curve becomes progressively monotonic decreasing .",
    "this particular behaviour can be responsible of the observed scatter around zero in fig.[aperture ] .",
    "in fact , according to the fraction of  covered by the slit one can get different @xmath16 . only for the galaxies with @xmath153",
    "the difference between the central velocity dispersion obtained from the small ( @xmath154 ) and large ( @xmath155 ) apertures is always greater than zero .",
    "interestingly enough we verified that for the virgo galaxies with @xmath153 we always have @xmath156 . anyway , taking into account the uncertainties on the measured @xmath16 , the prediction of this model can not be presently confirmed .    by applying the aperture correction to the data of dressler ( 1984 ) for the virgo and coma clusters",
    "the resulting  relation is @xmath157 and the differential distance modulus @xmath105 3.685 .",
    "the same correction applied to the data of the 7-sam ( for virgo ) and to our fornax sample gives @xmath158 and @xmath105 0.35 .",
    "notice the change of the slope from 1.26 to 1.53 , and the better agreement of the differential distance moduli with the average literature values .",
    "as already stated , the limits of the above results in the determination of the differential distance moduli are in : 1 ) the _ a priori _ assumption that the slope of the  relation is the same for the three clusters , 2 ) the choice of the `` representative '' sample of objects for the whole cluster , 3 ) the accuracy of the data ( in particular @xmath9 ) , and 4 ) the definition of the variables which enter the relation :  @xmath9 or the average @xmath16 within a prefixed radius .    before turning our attention to the errors associated to the use of the  relation , we have checked the assumed invariance of the slope @xmath159 . to this end",
    "we have shifted the fornax and coma galaxies to the distance to the virgo cluster using the above calculated @xmath160 , and fitted the whole distribution again . the result : @xmath161 with  @xmath105 0.08 , shown in fig .",
    "[ insieme ] , is in excellent agreement with eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] .",
    "let us now analize the fitting procedure .",
    "isobe  ( 1990 ) and feigelson & babu ( 1992 ) developed five methods for applying linear regression fits to a bivariate data distribution with unknown or negligible measurement errors .",
    "the advantage of their method is that the uncertainties in the slope and intercept of the fitted distribution , and in the process of comparative calibration , are evaluated through resampling procedures : jackknife and bootstrap error analysis .",
    "the bootstrap error analysis is based `` on the distribution of slopes and intercepts of a large number of data sets constructed by random sampling of the observed data set with replacement '' .",
    "the jackknife error analysis is performed in a similar way but with only @xmath162 synthetic data sets , each containing @xmath163 points from the original data set , leaving out one observation in sequence .",
    "following their approach we used the standard linear regression analysis ( program slopes , kindly provided by the authors ) , with the distance dependent variable ( @xmath164 ) as the y variable .",
    "this choice has the effect of minimizing the residuals in .",
    "the slopes for the virgo , fornax , and coma samples range from 1.16 to 1.37 , with different errors for the different samples . for the fornax cluster",
    "the errors in the intercept ( 0.69 ) and in the slope ( 0.31 ) are much larger than for the other two clusters , due to the large scatter of the data and to the small number of galaxies .    which is the error that affects the intercept offset ?",
    "assuming that the distance to the calibrating cluster is known with high accuracy (  that intercept and slope of the fit are error free ) , the error in the relative distance comes approximately from the uncertainties in @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) and in @xmath166 ( @xmath167 ) for the new sample of galaxies .",
    "since we are looking for the fit that minimizes the residuals of the new sample , and we assume that the slope is the same as that of the calibrating sample , we can set the maximum shift in the intercept equal to @xmath168 .",
    "being the errors in both coordinates equal to 0.02 ( minimum error ) , the minimum shift of the intercept is @xmath169 , corresponding to an error in  of 0.14 mag or 6% in distance .",
    "a more correct estimate of such errors comes from the program calib developed by isobe  ( 1990 ) and feigelson & babu ( 1992 ) , which predicts the value of the intercept ( and its uncertainty ) in the fit of a new sample of galaxies , from the linear regression of a calibrating sample , without the assumption that the two slopes are equal .    in summary",
    "this procedure gives @xmath170 and @xmath171 , assuming virgo and fornax respectively as calibrators , and @xmath172 and @xmath173 for coma and virgo , a 0.015 uncertainty in @xmath164 corresponds to @xmath3 error in the relative distance to the clusters .",
    "this is the minimum uncertainty attainable with such data for the relative distance between the two clusters .",
    "for the virgo galaxies of the  sample , the fp relation shown in fig .",
    "[ fp ] writes : @xmath174 the values of the coefficients are derived here through a multivariate statistical analysis .",
    "the  error of the fit is 0.06 , which translates into a 15% uncertainty in the distance to a single object , the same obtained with the  relation . for comparison",
    "jfk found for the coma cluster : @xmath175 , with a  of 0.046 .    assuming that the slope provided by the virgo cluster is also valid for fornax and coma , and using the jfk data we found respectively @xmath176 and @xmath177 . using the seeing corrected parameters of jrgensen  ( 1995a ) we found a @xmath178 mag in good agreement with the above uncorrected quantities .",
    "this means that the fp method gives exactly the same relative distance to virgo obtained through the  relation .",
    "the same result is obtained for coma if we adopt the fp relation derived by jfk .",
    "now , by setting @xmath179 and @xmath180 , and running again the program slopes and calib , we obtain : @xmath181 and @xmath182 , using virgo and fornax respectively as the calibrating samples , @xmath183 and @xmath184 , using instead virgo and coma . again",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath185 corresponds to a @xmath3 error in the relative distance to the clusters .",
    "the results of these programs are summarized in table  4 .    if we shift fornax and coma to the distance of virgo we obtain for the whole sample of 65 galaxies : @xmath186 with  @xmath105 0.09 , comparable to the intrinsic scatter of the relation , and corresponding to an uncertainty of @xmath14023% in distance .",
    "this is a value somewhat larger than previously reported in the literature .",
    "the distance moduli to fornax and coma relative to virgo , based on the fp relation , now span the interval @xmath187 mag , and @xmath188 mag , depending on the fitting method that is used .",
    "the second part of this paper is dedicated to a critical analysis of the  and fp relations , taking advantage of our well defined ( homogeneous and volume - limited ) sample of galaxies in virgo and fornax .",
    "the existence of a surface brightness bias in the  relation has been claimed by many authors (  lynden - bell  1988 , lgct , jfk , van albada  1993 ) .",

    "we finally present another method to derive the relative distance to the virgo and fornax clusters .",
    "this method is based on the  relation ( caon  1993 , young & currie 1994 ) and is shown in fig.[lognlogre ] . here",
    "@xmath222 is the exponent of the  sersic law best fitting the major axis surface brightness distribution of the galaxies , and @xmath264 is the effective radius in kpc .",
    "although the scatter in this relation is quite large ( the  of the fit is @xmath265 and the correlation coefficient is 0.7 ) , the intercept offset @xmath266 turns out to be @xmath267 , corresponding to @xmath268 mag , in excellent agreement with the  and fp relations .",
    "such agreement is remarkable although probably fortuitus given the large scatter of the data in this relation .",
    "the numerical results obtained in this work fitting the  and fp relations are summarized in table  4 .",
    "> from these data we derive @xmath269 mag and @xmath119 mag respectively for the relative distance moduli to fornax and coma with respect to the virgo cluster .",
    "taking into account the corrections for the aperture effects  is closer to 0.35 mag and  to 3.55 mag .",
    "our distance to fornax is slightly larger than derived with the other dis , but it is nearly equal to that derived with the bcm method ( see table  1 ) .",

    "ia are consistent .",
    "probably our estimates can be improved when new accurate and homogeneous central velocity dispersions and rotation velocities will be available for a complete sample of virgo and fornax early  type galaxies . actually , the large intrinsic scatter we found for the  and fp relation of fornax is at variance with previous determinations .",
    "we believe that the problem is in the measurements of @xmath16 : the large spread of our central velocity dispersions being caused by projection effects , @xmath16 anomalies , and the presence of inner sub - components such as disks or central black holes . in this context , the large uncertainty on resides probably in the different procedures used for measuring the velocity dispersions and in the corrections adopted for taking into account the effects of the aperture sizes .    by applying an average aperture correction to the central velocity dispersions",
    ", we obtain differential distance moduli in better agreement with the literature data , and we find that the tilt of the  relation increases .    looking at the data presented in this paper we conclude that the  and the fp relation give substantially the same result .",
    "an advantage of the  relation over the fp is that  can be measured with high photometric accuracy , while the effective radius  and  may depend on the actual shape of the luminosity profiles and on the error in the total luminosity of the galaxies .",
    "the errors in  and  are in fact usually correlated ( capaccioli  1992 ) .    at variance with van albada  ( 1993 )",
    ", we do not find any need for adding a surface brightness correction to the  relation , at least for the galaxies of the  sample .",
    "the inverse  relation of dressler  ( 1987 ) , coupled with the observed  and fp relations , has indicated that the residuals of the  relation depend only slightly on , since all the coefficients in eq .",
    "[ eq9 ] are approximately null .    the residuals in both",
    "the  and fp relations are found to be independent of the intrinsic luminosity of the galaxies , the ellipticity , the mean surface brightness and the boxiness / diskiness parameter .",
    "a trend of the residuals , on the other hand , is present with the exponent @xmath8 of the  sersic s law , with the maximum rotation velocity of the galaxies and with the @xmath294 ratio .",
    "the last result is in agreement with busarello  ( 1992 ) and prugniel & simien ( 1994 ) , who first pointed out the contribution of rotation to the global equilibrium of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the correlation of the residuals of the  relation with the @xmath7 ratio , with the anisotropy parameter @xmath227 , and with the exponent @xmath222 of the major axis light profiles of the galaxies are all indications of the non - homologous nature of the early - type galaxies .",
    "further improvements call for more accurate kinematical measurements , for a critical estimate of the different methods of data reductions , for a standard correction of the aperture effects , and for a deeper analysis of the kinematics of each individual galaxy . even at this stage , we are probably legitimated to say that most of the observed deviations from the fp are likely due to departures from the pure homology in the density distribution and in the dynamical structure of the early - type galaxies .    an important step for the use of the  and the fp relations as dis will be that of defining a `` representative sample '' of galaxies , of using standard selection criteria , and data with the same degree of homogeneity and accuracy , as well as variables properly and univocally determined .    in closing",
    "we want to remark that , while our analysis disagrees with saglia s  ( 1993 ) for what concerns the dependence of the residuals on the ellipticity and on @xmath221 , nonetheless we back their conclusion : the kinematical structure of the early  type galaxies , if not properly taken into account , may produce biased cluster distances , when the  and fp relations are used as dis without care .    aaronson m. , mould j. , 1986 , apj , 303 , 1 aaronson m. , persson s.e . , frogel j.a . , 1981 , apj , 245 , 18 aaronson m. , et al .",
