    "the recent realizations of bose - einstein condensation in dilute atomic vapors @xcite have not only stimulated many investigations on bose atoms but also studies of degenerate fermi gases .",
    "as opposed to charged fermi gases , i.e. nucleons or electrons in solids , the effects of fermi statistics in neutral atomic gases occur at much lower temperatures ( typically below @xmath0 ) and at densities which allow a treatment as dilute quantum gas because of the weak interatomic interactions . due to the selection rules for collisions , _ spin - polarized _ fermionic alkali atoms , like @xmath1li or @xmath2k in magnetic traps , remain metastable in the regime of quantum statistical degeneracy . due to fermi statistics the lowest scattering channel ( s - wave scattering )",
    "is closed for atoms in identical magnetic sublevels .",
    "therefore an ultracold spin - polarized fermi gas will be less influenced by interactions than the ultracold bose gases @xcite .",
    "also a bcs transition as studied in @xcite is naturally excluded here .",

    "this effect is neglected here .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is rather to consider the stationary features of an ideal fermi gas in isotropic or anisotropic harmonic traps .",
    "since our results are based on the numerical calculation of the state sum without further approximation , they are complementary to the recent paper of butts and rokhsar @xcite , where a continuous spectrum and thomas - fermi approximation were used .",
    "that treatment becomes exact in the limit of large particle numbers .",
    "in contrast , we here focus on the effects of small particle numbers , where the shell structure still affects the behavior of the many - particle system .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec.ii",

    "up to @xmath102 the function @xmath103 does not seem to depend on @xmath25 explicitly for the values considered here , but only on the relative filling of the fermi shell .",

    "for @xmath55 ( closed shell , @xmath117 ) , one observes a central minimum that disappears at @xmath118 ( half filled shell , @xmath119 ) .",
    "this shell gets totally filled at @xmath120 where @xmath114 has a maximum at @xmath121 .",
    "the @xmath25-dependence of the density at @xmath121 is due to the fact that shells with odd @xmath10 do not contribute to @xmath122 because they are made up of odd angular momentum states which all have zero density at the origin .",

    "the density approaches the thomas - fermi result .",
    "interestingly , @xmath114 is almost equal to this approximation for half filled fermi shells .",
    "experimentally realized magnetic traps are usually at least slightly anisotropic . in this section",
    "we therefore study a deformed oscillator with a potential @xmath126 i.e. we allow for prolate and oblate ellipsoid iso - energy surfaces .",
    "accordingly , the energy eigenvalues are @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 count radial and longitudinal excitations , respectively . for given @xmath128",
    "there are still @xmath130 degenerate states with different numbers of excitations in the two degenerate transversal directions ( number of partitions of @xmath131 ) .",
    "we use the notation @xmath132 for these states .",
    "the @xmath25-dependence of quantities at zero temperature turns out to have more features than in the isotropic case .",
    "for example only in the oblate case ( @xmath133 ) the notion of shell closures still exists because only then it is energetically favorable to fill up a transversal shell with degeneracy @xmath134 before populating a higher longitudinal state .",
    "however , these new structures occur on a smaller scale of particle numbers ( due to the smaller degeneracy factors ) and might be less accessible in experiments with a finite uncertainty of the atom number .    formulas analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : closed ] ) can only be given as sums .",

    "thus , one needs particles to populate all states up to @xmath140 . for @xmath133",
    ", there is an analogous expression . in general",
    ", the exact fermi energy can only be found by searching the lowest state @xmath132 with @xmath141 .",
    "however , the thomas - fermi approximation for the fermi energy is only slightly modified @xcite @xmath142 the sommerfeld formula eq .",
    "( [ eq : musommer ] ) for the chemical potential holds equally in the anisotropic case .    in the following ,",
    "we give some of the results for anisotropic traps .",
    "we concentrate on the case of a heavily deformed cigar - shaped trap , @xmath143 ( in fact @xmath144 like in @xcite ) .",
    "we first consider the dependence of the chemical potential on the temperature in the low - temperature regime .",
    "the graph of @xmath73 for @xmath145 particles displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cigmut ] shows a very intriguing feature : it starts linearly at @xmath28 as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : muapprox ] ) but then goes through a local maximum .",
    "the highest occupied state at @xmath28 is @xmath146 .",
    "so @xmath147 and with eq .",
    "( [ eq : strans ] ) @xmath148 .",
    "the next higher state is @xmath149 .",
    "the correction to the linear approximation including this state basically shows that it is responsible for the local maximum .",
    "indeed , the energy difference between the two states corresponds to @xmath150 which is roughly at the local minimum ( cf .",
    "arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : cigmut ] ) .",
    "thus , at the maximum of @xmath73 the next higher level above the fermi level becomes thermally accessible and @xmath39 decreases .",
    "as in the isotropic case , the specific heat shows deviations from the sommerfeld approximation at temperatures where the linear approximation for @xmath73 begins to fail . if @xmath82 is fixed to a value in that region , the graph of @xmath151 as a function of particle number ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cigcn ] ) exhibits structure on two scales of the particle number , considerably more complex than the isotropic analogue in fig .",
    "[ fig : cn ] .",
    "the big jumps take place whenever there are enough particles to access a new shell of the transversal oscillator .",

    "( [ eq : noccupation ] ) .",
    "the numerical results should again be compared to the thomas - fermi approximation at @xmath28 @xcite @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the so called `` fermi radius '' of the density distribution .",

    "@xmath174 ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : cigarrho ] ) .",
    "in transversal direction the density at zero temperature shows only very slight deviations from the thomas - fermi result .",
    "in contrast , the density in longitudinal direction shown on the right exhibits oscillations around this approximation .",
    "these oscillations are mainly due to a step - like behavior of the occupation number @xmath175 of the oscillator states in longitudinal direction , which is due to the filling of new transversal states .",
    "the steps have a width of @xmath162 .",
    "in addition , @xmath175 decreases much slower ( average derivative @xmath176 ) than the occupation number @xmath177 for the transversal states ( average derivative @xmath178 , here we consider @xmath179 ) . as a result ,",
    "the longitudinal density profile @xmath174 receives a bigger contribution from higher states than the transversal one , so one can still see the various maxima of high oscillator states in the first case but not in the latter .",
    "we finally note that for oblate traps the effects are basically the same as in prolate traps .",
    "the behavior of the density profiles is interchanged , the abovementioned oscillations occur in the transversal density profile and disappear in the longitudinal direction .",
    "our calculations have shown that quantum statistical effects on the easily accessible observables of a trapped fermi gas are restricted to the regime of rather small atom number , e.g. below @xmath180 . for larger atom numbers quantum statistical effects",

    "our work has been carried out using the grand canonical ensemble .",

    "however the deviations are often smaller than the difference between the interacting and the interaction - free case .",
    "problems like artificial fluctuations in a grand canonical ensemble of bosons will not occur for fermions .",
    "for that reason we do nt dwell on a comparison of the different ensembles here .",

    "a quantitative prediction of this effect depends on the relative magnitude of atom - atom interactions and the experimentally controllable energy gap @xmath181 . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", an effective suppression of the interactions in the ultracold regime can be attributed to the suppression of s - wave scattering for fermions in identical substates",
    ". therefore the ideal gas behavior might still be visible provided the harmonic potential is steep enough .",
    "bcs - like behavior as discussed in @xcite requires two spin states to be trapped .",
    "the effects of the harmonic potential in that situation have been allowed for in local density approximation in @xcite , i.e. for large atom numbers .",
