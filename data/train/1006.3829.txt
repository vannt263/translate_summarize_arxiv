    "light is a natural candidate to transmit information across large networks due to its high speed and low propagation losses .",
    "a major obstacle to building more advanced optical networks is the lack of an all - optically controlled device that can robustly delay or store optical wave - packets over a tunable amount of time . in the classical domain",
    ", such a device would enable all - optical buffering and switching , bypassing the need to convert an optical pulse to an electronic signal .",
    "in the quantum realm , such a device could serve as a memory to store the full quantum information contained in a light pulse until it can be passed to a processing node at some later time .",
    "a number of schemes to coherently delay and store optical information are being actively explored .",
    "these range from tunable coupled resonator optical waveguide  ( crow ) structures  @xcite , where the propagation of light is dynamically altered by modulating the refractive index of the system , to electromagnetically induced transparency  ( eit ) in atomic media  @xcite , where the optical pulse is reversibly mapped into internal atomic degrees of freedom .",
    "while these schemes have been demonstrated in a number of remarkable experiments  @xcite , they remain difficult to implement in a practical setting . here",
    ", we present a novel approach to store or stop an optical pulse propagating through a waveguide , wherein coupling between the waveguide and a nearby nano - mechanical resonator array enables one to map the optical field into long - lived mechanical excitations .",
    "this process is completely quantum coherent and allows the delay and release of pulses to be rapidly and all - optically tuned .",
    "our scheme combines many of the best attributes of previously proposed approaches , in that it simultaneously allows for large bandwidths of operation , on - chip integration , relatively long delay / storage times , and ease of external control . beyond light storage",
    ", this work opens up the intriguing possibility of a platform for quantum or classical all - optical information processing using mechanical systems .",
    "an optomechanical crystal  @xcite is a periodic structure that constitutes both a photonic  @xcite and a phononic  @xcite crystal .",
    "the ability to engineer optical and mechanical properties in the same structure should enable unprecedented control over light - matter interactions .",
    "planar two - dimensional ( 2d ) photonic crystals , formed from patterned thin dielectric films on the surface of a microchip , have been succesfully employed as nanoscale optical circuits capable of efficiently routing , diffracting , and trapping light .",
    "fabrication techniques for such 2d photonic crystals have matured significantly over the last decade , with experiments on a si chip  @xcite demonstrating excellent optical transmission through long  ( @xmath0 ) linear arrays of coupled photonic crystal cavities . in a similar si chip platform it has recently been shown that suitably designed photonic crystal cavities also contain localized acoustic resonances which are strongly coupled to the optical field via radiation pressure  @xcite .",
    "these planar optomechanical crystals  ( omcs ) are thus a natural candidate for implementation of our proposed slow - light scheme .     and @xmath1 , whose resonance frequencies differ by the frequency of the mechanical mode @xmath2 . both optical modes leak energy into the waveguide at a rate @xmath3 and have an inherent decay rate @xmath4 .",

    "each element of the array contains two optical cavity modes  ( denoted @xmath18 ) and a co - localized mechanical resonance .",

    "in addition to the optomechanical interaction described by equation  ( [ eq : h ] ) , the cavity modes @xmath22 are coupled to a common two - way waveguide  ( described below ) .",
    "each element is decoupled from the others except through the waveguide .",
    "the design considerations necessary to achieve such a system are discussed in detail in the section `` optomechanical crystal design . '' for now , we take as typical parameters @xmath25  thz , @xmath26  ghz , @xmath27  mhz , and mechanical and ( unloaded ) optical quality factors of @xmath28  ( room temperature)-@xmath29  ( low temperature ) and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the mechanical decay rate and @xmath32 is the intrinsic optical cavity decay rate .",

    ", this hamiltonian leads to efficient optical cooling of the mechanical motion  @xcite , a technique being used to cool nano - mechanical systems toward their quantum ground states  @xcite .",
    "while the majority of such work focuses on how optical fields affect the mechanical dynamics , here we show that the optomechanical interaction strongly modifies optical field propagation to yield the slow / stopped light phenomenon .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : hlinear ] ) is quite general and thus this phenomenon could in principle be observed in any array of optomechanical systems coupled to a waveguide . in practice , there are several considerations that make the 2d omc `` ideal . ''",
    "first , our system exhibits an extremely large optomechanical coupling @xmath5 and contains a second optical tuning cavity that can be driven resonantly , which enables large driving amplitudes @xmath6 using reasonable input power  @xcite . using two different cavities",
    "also potentially allows for greater versatility and addressability of our system .",
    "for instance , in our proposed design the photons in cavity @xmath22 are spatially filtered from those in cavity 2  @xcite .",
    "second , the 2d omc is an easily scalable and compact platform . finally , as described below ,",
    "the high mechanical frequency of our device compared to typical optomechanical systems allows for a good balance between long storage times and suppression of noise processes .",
    "we first analyze propagation in the waveguide when @xmath41 is static during the transit interval of the signal pulse . as shown in the appendix , the evolution equations in a rotating frame for a single element located at position @xmath42 along the waveguide are given by & = & -+i_m+i((z_j)+(z_j))+(z_j),[eq : dadt ] + & = & -+i_m+(t).[eq : dbdt ] equation  ( [ eq : dadt ] ) is a standard input relation characterizing the coupling of right- ( @xmath43 ) and left - propagating ( @xmath44 ) optical input fields in the waveguide with the cavity mode . here",
    "@xmath45 is the total optical cavity decay rate , @xmath46 is quantum noise associated with the inherent optical cavity loss , and for simplicity we have assumed a linear dispersion relation @xmath47 in the waveguide .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : dbdt ] ) describes the optically driven mechanical motion , which decays at a rate @xmath48 and is subject to thermal noise @xmath49 .",
    "the cavity mode couples to the right - propagating field through the equation ( + ) ( z , t)=i(z - z_j)+ik_0,[eq : waveeqn ] where @xmath50 .",
    "we solve the above equations to find the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath51 of a single element for a right - propagating incoming field of frequency @xmath52  ( see appendix ) . in the limit where @xmath53 , and defining @xmath54 , r(_k)=- , while @xmath55 .",
    "example reflectance and transmittance curves are plotted in figure  [ fig : system](c ) . for any non - zero @xmath6 , a single element is perfectly transmitting on resonance , whereas for @xmath8 resonant transmission past the cavity is blocked .",
    "when @xmath56 , excitation of the cavity mode is inhibited through destructive interference between the incoming field and the optomechanical coupling . in eit , a similar effect occurs via interference between two electronic transitions .",
    "this analogy is further elucidated by considering the level structure of our optomechanical system  ( figure  [ fig : system](d ) ) , where the interference pathways and the `` @xmath17''-type transition reminiscent of eit are clearly visible .",
    "the interference is accompanied by a steep phase variation in the transmitted field around resonance , which can result in a slow group velocity . these steep features and their similarity to eit in a single optomechanical system",

    "the color coding of the dispersion curves  ( red for waveguide , green for optical cavity , blue for mechanical resonance ) indicates the distribution of energy or fractional occupation in the various degrees of freedom of the system in steady - state . far away from the cavity resonance ,",
    "the dispersion relation is nearly linear and simply reflects the character of the input optical waveguide , while the propagation is strongly modified near resonance  ( @xmath65 ) . in the absence of optomechanical coupling  ( @xmath8 ) , a transmission band gap of width @xmath66 forms around the optical cavity resonance ( reflections from the bare optical cavity elements constructively interfere ) . in the presence of optomechanical driving , the band gap splits in two ( blue shaded regions ) and a new propagation band centered around",
    "the cavity resonance appears in the middle of the band gap . for weak",

    "this relatively flat polaritonic band yields the slow - light propagation of interest .",
    "indeed , for small @xmath6 the steady - state energy in this band is almost completely mechanical in character , indicating the strong mixing and conversion of energy in the waveguide to mechanical excitations along the array .",
    "it can be shown that the bloch wavevector near resonance is given by  ( see appendix ) k_0+++.[eq : keff ] the group velocity on resonance , @xmath71 can be dramatically slowed by an amount that is tunable through the optomechanical coupling strength @xmath6 .",
    "the quadratic and cubic terms in @xmath72 characterize pulse absorption and group velocity dispersion , respectively . in the relevant regime where @xmath73 , these effects are negligible within a bandwidth @xmath74 .",
    "the second term is the bandwidth over which certain frequency components of the pulse acquire a @xmath75-phase shift relative to others , leading to pulse distortion .",
    "this yields a bandwidth - delay product of ( , ( 6n^2)^1/3)[eq : bwdelayproduct ] for static @xmath6 and negligible mechanical losses .",
    "when intrinsic optical cavity losses are negligible , and if one is not concerned with pulse distortion , light can propagate over the full bandwidth @xmath68 of the slow - light polariton band and the bandwidth - delay product increases to @xmath76  ( see appendix ) .",
    "on the other hand , we note that if we had operated in a regime where @xmath77 , constructive interference in reflection would limit the bandwidth - delay product to @xmath78 , independent of system size .    in the static regime ,",
    "the bandwidth - delay product obtained here is analogous to crow systems  @xcite . in the case of eit , a static bandwidth - delay product of @xmath79 results , where od is the optical depth of the atomic medium .",
    "this product is limited by photon absorption and re - scattering into other directions , and is analogous to our result @xmath80 in the case of large intrinsic cavity linewidth . on the other hand , when @xmath4 is negligible , photons are never lost and reflections can be suppressed by interference .",
    "this yields an improved scaling @xmath81 or @xmath82 , depending on whether one is concerned with group velocity dispersion . in atomic media",
    ", the weak atom - photon coupling makes achieving @xmath83 very challenging  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in our system as few as @xmath84 elements would be equivalently dense .",
    "we now show that the group velocity @xmath85 can in fact be adiabatically changed once a pulse is completely localized inside the system , leading to distortion - less propagation at a dynamically tunable speed .",
    "in particular , by tuning @xmath86 , the pulse can be completely stopped and stored .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood in terms of the static band structure of the system  ( figure  [ fig : bandstructure ] ) and a `` dynamic compression '' of the pulse bandwidth .",
    "the same physics applies for crow structures  @xcite , and the argument is re - summarized here .",
    "first , under constant @xmath6 , an optical pulse within the bandwidth of the polariton band completely enters the medium .",
    "once the pulse is inside , we consider the effect of a gradual reduction in @xmath87 .",
    "decomposing the pulse into bloch wavevector components , it is clear that each bloch wavevector is conserved under arbitrary changes of @xmath6 , as it is fixed by the system periodicity .",
    "furthermore , transitions to other bands are negligible provided that the energy levels are varied adiabatically compared to the size of the gap , which translates into an adiabatic condition @xmath88 .",
    "then , conservation of the bloch wavevector implies that the bandwidth of the pulse is dynamically compressed , and the reduction in slope of the polariton band  ( figure  [ fig : bandstructure ] ) causes the pulse to propagate at an instantaneous group velocity @xmath89 without any distortion . in the limit that @xmath90 , the polaritonic band becomes flat and completely mechanical in character , indicating that the pulse has been reversibly and coherently mapped onto stationary mechanical excitations within the array .",
    "we note that since @xmath6 is itself set by the tuning cavities , its rate of change can not exceed the optical linewidth and thus the adiabaticity condition is always satisfied in the weak - driving regime .",
    "the maximum storage time is set by the mechanical decay rate , @xmath91 . for realistic system parameters @xmath26  ghz and @xmath92 , this yields a storage time of @xmath93s . in crow structures ,",
    "light is stored as circulating fields in optical nano - cavities , where state of the art quality factors of @xmath94 limit the storage time to @xmath95  ns .",
    "the key feature of our system is that we effectively `` down - convert '' the high - frequency optical fields to low - frequency mechanical excitations , which naturally decay over much longer time scales .",
    "while storage times of @xmath96  ms are possible using atomic media  @xcite , their bandwidths so far have been limited to @xmath97  mhz  @xcite . in our system , bandwidths of @xmath95  ghz",
    "are possible for realistic circulating powers in the tuning cavities",
    ".      the major source of error in our device will be mechanical noise , which through the optomechanical coupling can be mapped into noise power in the optical waveguide output . in our system ,",
    "mechanical noise emerges via thermal fluctuations and stokes scattering  ( corresponding to the counter - rotating terms in the optomechanical interaction that we omitted from equation  ( [ eq : hlinear ] ) ) . to analyze these effects",
    ", it suffices to consider the case of static  @xmath6 , and given the linearity of the system , no waveguide input  ( such that the output will be purely noise ) . for a single array element , the optomechanical driving @xmath6 results in optical cooling of the mechanical motion  @xcite , with the mechanical energy @xmath98 evolving as  ( see appendix ) = -_m(e_m-_m|n_)-e_m+(e_m+_m).[eq : demdt ] the first term on the right describes equilibration with the thermal surroundings , where @xmath99 is the bose occupation number at the mechanical frequency and @xmath100 is the bath temperature .",
    "the second  ( third ) term corresponds to cooling  ( heating ) through anti - stokes  ( stokes ) scattering , with a rate proportional to @xmath101 .",
    "the stokes process is suppressed relative to the anti - stokes in the limit of good sideband resolution @xmath102 . for an array of @xmath103 elements ,",
    "a simple upper bound for the output noise power at one end of the waveguide is given by @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the steady - state solution of equation  ( [ eq : demdt ] ) .",
    "the factor of @xmath106 accounts for the optical noise exiting equally from both output directions , @xmath107 is the optically - induced mechanical energy dissipation rate , and @xmath108 describes the waveguide coupling efficiency .",
    "the term @xmath109 represents the transduction of mechanical to optical energy and is essentially the price that one pays for down - converting optical excitations to mechanical to yield longer storage times  in turn , any mechanical noise gets `` up - converted '' to optical energy  ( whereas the probability of having a thermal optical photon is negligible ) . in the relevant regime where @xmath110 , ( _ m|n_+()^2 ) .",
    "this noise analysis is valid only in the weak - driving regime  ( @xmath67 )  @xcite .",
    "the strong driving regime , where the mechanical motion acquires non - thermal character  @xcite and can become entangled with the optical fields  @xcite , will be treated in future work .    at room temperature , @xmath111 is large and thermal noise will dominate , yielding a noise power of @xmath112  nw per element for previously given system parameters and @xmath113 .",
    "this is independent of @xmath114 provided that @xmath110 , which reflects the fact that all of the thermal heating is removed through the optical channel.for high temperatures , the thermal noise scales inversely with @xmath58 , and the use of high - frequency mechanical oscillators ensures that the noise remains easily tolerable even at room temperature .    thermal noise in the high - frequency oscillator",
    "can essentially be eliminated in cryogenic environments , which then enables faithful storage of single photons .",
    "intuitively , a single - photon pulse can be stored for a period only as long as the mechanical decay time @xmath115 , and as long as a noise - induced mechanical excitation is unlikely to be generated over a region covering the pulse length and over the transit time @xmath116 .",
    "the latter condition is equivalent to the statement that the power @xmath117 in the single - photon pulse exceeds @xmath118 . while we have focused on the static regime thus far , when thermal heating is negligible , realizing @xmath119 in the static case in fact ensures that the inequality holds even when @xmath120 is time - varying .",
    "physically , the rate of stokes scattering scales linearly with @xmath114 while the group velocity scales inversely , and thus the probability of a noise excitation being added on top of the single - photon pulse is fixed over a given transit length .    in a realistic setting ,",
    "the optomechanical driving amplitude @xmath6 itself will be coupled to the bath temperature , as absorption of the pump photons in the tuning cavities leads to material heating .",
    "to understand the limitations as a quantum memory , we have numerically optimized the static bandwidth - delay product @xmath121 for a train of single - photon pulses , subject to the constraints @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 . as a realistic model for the bath temperature , we take @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the base temperature and @xmath127k is a temperature coefficient that describes heating due to pump absorption  ( see appendix ) . using @xmath128  mk and @xmath129 ,",
