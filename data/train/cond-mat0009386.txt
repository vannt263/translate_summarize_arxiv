    "a molecular wire in its simplest definition is a single molecule which is used as a bridge to carry electronic current between metallic contacts .",
    "recently developed techniques that allow manipulation of matter at the atomic scale have made remarkable experiments on molecular wires possible .",
    "some of the first experiments measuring the current through single molecules employed the scanning tunnelling microscope ( stm)@xcite or used self - assembly to bridge the gap between two nanoscopic metal leads with a single molecule ( 1,4 benzene - dithiolate ) whose current - voltage characteristic was then measured.@xcite these and other two terminal measurements@xcite have shown that a molecular wire does not behave like a simple ohmic resistor but displays features arising from the quantum states of the molecule .",
    "theoretical work on molecular wires has proposed various models for the explanation of the observed phenomena and has until now focused on two - terminal devices.@xcite    for two terminal mesoscopic systems , landauer theory@xcite relates the electronic current to the transmission probability for a single electron to scatter through the system .",
    "coherent transport in multi - terminal mesoscopic systems has been treated by bttiker who has given an extension of landauer theory@xcite , and christen and bttiker have discussed charging effects in such systems.@xcite however , to date there has been very little theoretical work done addressing these issues in the context of multi - terminal molecular wire systems.@xcite    in this paper , we present a self - consistent method based on bttiker - landauer theory for the evaluation of electronic current in a multi - terminal molecular wire system .",
    "this method considers explicitly the effects of charging in molecular wires due to the application of voltages to the terminals .",
    "the theory is then applied to a molecular wire transistor ( a three - terminal molecular wire device ) .",
    "the system we consider is a @xmath0-conjugated chain molecule with thiol end groups self - assembled onto the cleaved edge of a multilayer substrate .",
    "the substrate consists of alternating metal and insulating thin films .",
    "the chain bridges two of the metal films and passes over a third metal film which acts as a gate . for the system",
    "considered we find that transistor - like behavior is possible if the electric field of the gate is enhanced by chargeable adsorbates on its surface .",
    "we also find that charge density waves and charged solitons form in this molecular wire system and play an important role in its response to applied bias voltages .",
    "i summarizes briefly the necessary results from bttiker - landauer theory for the evaluation of the electronic current in a multi - terminal molecular wire .",
    "a method for solving the single - electron scattering problem is presented in sec .",
    "our self - consistent method for determining the electro - static potential is presented in sec .",
    "these methods are then applied to the calculation of the charging behavior and current vs.  gate bias voltage characteristics of a three terminal molecular wire transistor in sec .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "v. an appendix describing the electrostatics of the molecular wire configuration that was studied is also included .",
    "for two - terminal mesoscopic systems ( such as a molecule bridging two metallic electrodes ) , the electronic current can be calculated using landauer theory.@xcite the systems that will be of interest in this article have more than two metallic contacts and thus it is necessary to have a method for calculating the current in these multi - terminal structures .",
    "bttiker and christen have generalized landauer theory to provide a theoretical framework for treating transport at finite voltages for systems connected to more than two leads.@xcite we give a brief summary of their relevant results .    consider a mesoscopic conductor ( such as a molecular wire ) attached to @xmath1 different terminals or reservoirs @xmath2 .",
    "each of these reservoirs may be at a different electro - chemical potential @xmath3 .",
    "the important quantity is the difference between each of these electro - chemical potentials and a common reference electro - chemical potential @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "this can be related to the bias voltage applied to the reservoir by @xmath6 .",
    "the current flowing into one of these reservoirs will be related to the probability for an electron to scatter into that reservoir , however now there are more scattering processes that can occur .",
    "an electron scattering from the @xmath7 reservoir to the @xmath8 reservoir is assigned a transmission probability @xmath9 .",
    "reflection within the @xmath8 reservoir is described by the reflection probability @xmath10 .",
    "the net current flowing into the @xmath11 reservoir has several contributions .",
    "electrons scatter into it from every other reservoir , and the current contributed by the @xmath7 reservoir is @xmath12 .",
    "there is also a contribution due to reflected electrons and this is given by @xmath13 .",
    "adding these two contributions gives the total current flowing into reservoir @xmath8 .",
    "however there is also current flowing out of reservoir @xmath8 and this is given by @xmath14 .",
    "the net current flowing into reservoir @xmath8 is given by the difference between these contributions . combining these terms the current contribution in the lead connected to terminal @xmath8 due to small differences in the electro - chemical potentials",
    "is given by @xmath15 this can be generalized to finite temperature @xmath16 and finite voltages by integrating over the fermi distributions , @xmath17 + 1)$ ] , of each of the reservoirs .",
    "this gives , @xmath18 this equation properly reduces to the two terminal result if @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the transmission and reflection probabilities that enter eq .",
    "( [ eq : multi - landauer ] ) depend on the electric fields throughout the system that arise from the application of the bias voltages and from the charges on the molecule .",
    "a later section provides a self - consistent method for handling this problem .",
    "a variety of techniques exist for the evaluation of the relevant scattering probabilities that go into the calculation of the current .",
    "the method that we use determines these quantities directly from the single electron wave function .",
    "the wave function is calculated by solving schroedinger s equation for the scattered electron .",
    "thus the problem is to find the wave function @xmath21 for an electron with energy @xmath22 incident from reservoir @xmath8 .",
    "this wave function satisfies @xmath23|\\psi^\\alpha\\rangle = e|\\psi^\\alpha\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the single electron hamiltonian of the coupled system in the absence of applied biases and @xmath25 is the electro - static potential that depends upon the voltages @xmath26 applied to the terminals and the charges @xmath27 in the system . for simplicity , we assume that each of the reservoirs has only one electronic mode ( the generalization to multi - channel reservoirs is straightforward but the notation becomes complicated ) .",
    "we represent the system of leads and molecule using the tight - binding approximation with an orthogonal set of atomic orbitals .",
    "the molecule has a set of atomic orbitals @xmath28 .",
    "each of the @xmath1 reservoirs also has a set of orbitals and these are denoted @xmath29 where @xmath30 on the @xmath11 reservoir .",
    "the complete wave function can be written as a sum of the wave functions in each of the reservoirs @xmath8 and the wave function on the molecule ( m ) latexmath:[$|\\psi^\\alpha\\rangle = \\sum_{\\alpha ' } |\\psi_{\\alpha'}\\rangle +    the following for an electron incident from the @xmath11 reservoir :    @xmath32    inserting the above wave function into schroedinger s equation yields an infinite set of linear equations in the unknowns @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . applying the bras @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 yields a solvable set of linearly independent equations .    with",
    "the scattering coefficients determined the transmission and reflection probabilities for multi - terminal scattering are found from    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the velocity of an electron with energy @xmath22 in the @xmath11 reservoir .",
    "in this section the question as to how to deal with the electric field due to the applied voltages and the charge in the system will be addressed .",
    "the electro - static potential energy @xmath41 has several contributions .",
    "first , there is the contribution due to the electro - static potential due to the presence of the reservoirs , each at a different voltage bias .",
    "this is found from the solution to laplace s equation @xmath42 subject to the boundary condition that the surface of each reservoir is an equipotential .",
    "secondly , the electro - static field will induce a non - equilibrium charge distribution on the molecule .",
    "because of this and because of chemical charge transfer effects between different atoms that occur even in the absence of bias voltages , the atoms along the wire will no longer be electrically neutral , and this can be quantified as fractional ionization charge @xmath43 for atom @xmath44 on the molecule ( @xmath45 corresponds to a negatively charged ion ) . at the mean - field level of approximation a propagating electron at position @xmath46 will now interact with these charges via an unscreened coulomb potential . and",
    "lastly , these induced charges will in turn generate image charges in all of the metallic contacts .",
    "thus the electrostatic energy terms that must be included in a mean field treatment of the molecular wire are @xmath47 the potentials @xmath48 and @xmath49 both depend on the system s geometry . a solution for the specific three terminal geometry considered below is presented in the appendix .    within tba ,",
    "the presence of the electrostatic terms modifies the site energy of each orbital on the molecule .",
    "for instance , if each atom of the molecule only has a single orbital , then the diagonal element @xmath50 for the @xmath51 atom of the molecule becomes @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a charge dependent site energy for atom @xmath54 . in the chemistry literature @xmath53",
    "is usually taken to be a linear or quadratic fit to ionization potential energy data .",
    "thus @xmath55 where @xmath56 is roughly equal to the average of the ionization energies for the + ve ion and -ve ion ( although the best fit may depart from this ) , and @xmath57 is an energy associated with fractional charging.@xcite this treatment of the on - site energies can also be regarded as a tight - binding version of the local density approximation since the first order variation of the charge density contribution to the site energy generates a linear term associated with the derivative of the site energy with respect to the fractional charge .",
    "thus the problem that now needs to be addressed is the determination of the charge on the wire .",
    "this is a self - consistent problem .",
    "the scattering problem must be solved to determine the charge .",
    "then this charge must be used to adjust the effective hamiltonian , and then the scattering problem must be solved again .",
    "this must be repeated until the charge on the wire converges .    in each iteration",
    "the charge is calculated as follows : since the wave function is being calculated explicitly from schroedinger s equation , the probability of an electron being on a certain site @xmath44 on the molecule is given by @xmath58 for a given scattering state .",
    "the spectral charge on that site contributed by an electron incident with energy @xmath22 ( propagating in a bloch state with wave vector @xmath59 ) from reservoir @xmath8 is simply @xmath60 .",
    "hence the charge on site @xmath44 due to electrons incident from lead @xmath8 is found by integrating over all the occupied bloch states in that reservoir .",
    "the total charge is then found by summing over all the reservoirs .",
    "[ normalization has not been considered yet .",
    "the proper normalization for a scattering state @xmath21 is @xmath61 ( where @xmath1 is the number of unit cells ) since this is the normalization for a propagating bloch wave that will exist deep within the reservoirs .",
    "thus in the above , the charge needs to be divided by @xmath1 ] . thus the charge can be written ( including a factor of 2 for spin ) as @xmath63 converting the wave vector sum into an integral ( and making a change of variables to the reduced wave vector @xmath64 ) results in latexmath:[\\[q_j = -\\frac{2 e}{n } \\frac{l}{2\\pi a}\\sum_{\\alpha } \\int_0^{y_f } dy^\\alpha\\ ;    integral into an energy integral over the energy band of each reservoir @xmath8 , using @xmath66 , and generalizing to finite temperatures and voltages by using the fermi function for reservoir @xmath8 , @xmath67 , the following expression is arrived at for the total charge on atom @xmath44 of the molecule ,",
    "@xmath68 we now consider an application of the above method to a multi - terminal molecular wire system .",
    "in this section we present a feasible suggestion for a molecular wire transistor ( mwt ) and study it theoretically by the methods described above . a simple transistor functions by transmitting a current between an electron source and drain and tuning this current by the application of a voltage to a gate . at low gate voltages ,",
    "current flows freely through the transistor under an applied bias between the source and drain .",
    "as the gate voltage increases an electro - static barrier forms and the current decreases significantly .",
    "whether behavior of this type can be exhibited by a single - molecule device ( a mwt ) has been a long - standing open question both experimentally and theoretically : the solid state transistor operates essentially on classical electro - magnetic principles  an electric field suppresses the flow of electrons which is governed by boltzmann diffusion .",
    "when electrons flow through a molecule , their dynamics is governed not by classical physics but by quantum physics and the length and energy scales involved are also very different from those in solid state transistors . we show that these physical differences are very important , but that they can be addressed and that a working mwt should be feasible .    the greatest experimental challenge in developing a mwt is the introduction of the third terminal which should act as the gate . to date this has been achieved only in experiments on carbon nanotubes that were contacted lithographically to metal leads at the ends and then a gate potential was applied via an stm tip that was brought close to the middle of the tube.@xcite in the present work a three terminal structure consisting of a molecule _ self - assembled _ on the cleaved edge of a multilayer consisting of three metallic films each a few monolayers thick and separated from the other metal layers by thin insulating layers ( as is shown schematically in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) is considered . in the figure",
    "the outermost metal layers act as source and drain , and the inner layer is the gate .",
    "although such structures have not yet been realized experimentally , it is reasonable to expect that they will be fabricated in the future .",
    "our purpose here is to explore theoretically the fundamental principles that will help to guide experimental work on such systems .",
    "the molecule that is considered is a @xmath0-conjugated carbon chain molecule terminated with thiol ( sulfur ) groups .",
    "the @xmath0-conjugation provides for relatively easy electron transport along the chain between source and drain ; such chains when strongly coupled to metallic leads are very conductive ( relative to other molecular conductors ) .",
    "the thiols make for strong bonds between the ends of the chain and the source and drain respectively and are responsible for self - assembly of the mwt on the substrate . in the absence of the gate , this is just a two terminal molecular device , broadly similar to the molecular wires that have already been discussed and studied experimentally.@xcite    the conducting layers of the substrate are assumed to be gold . at the fermi energy of gold , electrons on the molecular chain",
    "reside in orbitals that are @xmath0 like .",
    "thus when the chain is bonded between the source and drain , transport of electrons is along the conjugated @xmath0 backbone of the chain . in the self - assembled structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the carbon chain is oriented such that these @xmath0 orbitals are parallel to the substrate s surface ; this implies a low probability of electron hopping between the surface and molecule .    in the tight - binding scheme , only the @xmath0 orbital of each carbon atom",
    "is taken into account and it is assigned a site energy of @xmath69  ev .",
    "the structure of the chain is taken to be undimerized trans - polyacetylene .",
    "only nearest neighbour hopping is considered on the chain and a value of @xmath70  ev is assigned to the hopping matrix element .",
    "transport in the gold terminals in the substrate of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is modeled using single channel ideal leads . since gold is an s - orbital metal , only its 6s orbital",
    "is considered and this is assigned a site energy of @xmath71  ev ( the equilibrium fermi energy for this model ) .",
    "the hopping energy of the gold leads was taken to be @xmath72  ev . the sulfurs are modelled using their 3p orbitals which have a site energy of @xmath73  ev . to simulate charge transfer ,",
    "a single gold atom is bonded beneath each sulfur atom .",
    "( if the sulfur atoms were coupled directly to the ideal leads , the surface charging that occurs at the interface between the sulfur atoms and the gold surface would be neglected .",
    "these single gold atoms are used to simulate the physics of the surface layer of gold and the chemistry of the sulfurs binding over hollow sites on the gold surface ) .",
    "each of these gold atoms is coupled to a single channel lead .",
    "they are positioned 2     above the equipotential surface ( depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] of the appendix ) .",
    "thus the equipotential surface is assumed to begin below the surface layer of the gold leads . to simulate the strong binding that occurs when sulfur binds over a hollow site on the gold surface , each of these gold atoms",
    "is strongly bonded to its sulfur atom and this is quantified by a hopping energy of @xmath74  ev .",
    "each sulfur is assumed to be positioned 2     above its gold atom .",
    "similarly the binding between the sulfurs and the carbon is assumed to be strong , and this hopping energy is assigned a value of @xmath74  ev .",
    "the sulfur - carbon bond is taken to be 1.8   .",
    "the fractional charging energy @xmath57 that multiplies the linear term in @xmath75 in the site energy for each of these orbitals was taken to be 11.5  ev for the c 2p , 9.7  ev for the s 3p , and 8.6  ev for the au 6s.@xcite    the above methods together with the results of the appendix for the electrostatic potential due to the metal terminals were used to calculate the current as a function of gate voltage through a mwt based on @xmath76 molecule .",
    "( this is similar to the molecule depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] but has two more @xmath77 groups ) .",
    "a symmetric source - drain bias voltage of 1  v was assumed and gate voltages up to a bias of -5  v ( i.e. , + 5  ev for an electron ) were studied .",
    "we found that charge is transferred to the chain .",
    "this is consistent with the polymer literature which reports charge transfer from the metal to carbon chains .",
    "however it was also found that the electric current along the carbon chain was resistant to the application of the gate voltage .",
    "electron transport along the backbone remained unhindered , and the current was almost independent of the gate bias voltage ( the circles in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that in a functioning mwt the gate needs to interact with the chain molecule much more strongly than it does in the system considered above .",
    "our proposed solution to this problem is to adsorb onto the surface of the gate an atomic species that charges up as the gate voltage is applied and thus enhances the effective electrostatic interaction between the gate and chain molecule .",
    "we have chosen sulfur since it binds readily to gold surfaces and gains charge from the gold surface of the gate as a bias is applied to the gate in this model .",
    "( for the narrow nanoscale gates considered here , there is a substantial electric field in the vicinity of the gate due to the applied gate bias which helps to push charge onto the adsorbed sulfur atom . for much wider gates",
    "this effect is lessened significantly as the surface electric field is much weaker ) .",
    "for the same chain molecule as above , a single sulfur atom adsorbed on the gate was modeled by situating it 2.5    below the middle carbon atom of the chain .",
    "again this sulfur atom was bonded over a single gold atom so as to simulate the charge transfer that would take place in the physical system .",
    "the gold atom was then attached to a single - channel ideal lead .",
    "now as the gate voltage is applied , the sulfur charges up , and this extra local charge results in an electro - static potential barrier that can significantly reduce the current flowing through the molecular wire .",
    "[ note that this sulfur atom should not bond to the @xmath0 carbon backbone since its p orbital is orthogonal to it.@xcite although it may modify the @xmath78 bonding structure , it should also not form any @xmath78 bonds since these are saturated along the carbon chain . ] the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( up triangles ) for a 1 v source - drain bias .",
    "there is now a clear reduction in the current as the gate voltage is increased .",
    "a mwt with a second sulfur atom also adsorbed on the gate is depicted in fig .",
    "( the sulfur atoms on the gate are 2.8    apart  this corresponds roughly to the distance between hollow sites on an ideal ( 100 ) gold surface ) .",
    "the two sulfurs together have a stronger effect on the current .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( diamonds ) ; the current is now reduced by a factor of 3 at a gate voltage of -2.5 v. this significant reduction in the current is due to the formation of a large potential energy barrier along the wire .    the self - consistently calculated site energy of each atom is plotted in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "first the 0 v gate voltage result ( fig .  [ fig3]a ) should be noted .",
    "the source is held at @xmath79  v ( + 0.5  ev electron energy ) and the drain at + 0.5  v. right at the interface between the gold and the thiol , a potential barrier is formed due to charge transfer .",
    "( including the single gold atoms between the ideal leads , which are assumed to form an equipotential , and the sulfur allows this barrier to be modeled in the present calculations ) .",
    "the potential along the carbon chain is roughly flat due to charge re - arrangement on the chain .",
    "[ fig3]b shows the site energy along the wire at a gate voltage of @xmath80  v. there is now a significant electrostatic potential barrier in the middle of the carbon chain .",
    "the potential barrier is not smooth , but consists of peaks and valleys due to alternating distances between the carbon atoms and the adsorbed sulfur atoms on the gate in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "this barrier hinders electron transport as is seen in the plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) of the transmission probability of an electron from the source to the drain .",
    "the reduction in transmission probability is associated with the formation of a gap in the sequence of resonant states around the fermi energy , as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] : at zero gate voltage ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]a ) there is a strong resonance at the fermi energy of @xmath71  ev .",
    "[ fig4]b corresponds to a gate voltage of @xmath80 v and there is now a clear gap between the resonant states around the fermi energy . for longer carbon chains with more sulfurs on the gate",
    "the nearly periodic structure of the barrier creates the equivalent of a band gap with the fermi energy lying near the edge of the lower energy band .",
    "the molecule transmits electrons quite well at energies outside of the band gap that forms around the fermi energy .",
    "increasing the length of the barrier suppresses transmission further in the band gap .",
    "however because the fermi energy lies near the edge of the bottom transmitting band , as the gate voltage is increased further , eventually the resonant states in the lower band begin to transmit a net current and the current rises .",
    "stronger transistor action could be achieved for a fermi energy more centered within the gap . however , in the simulations , charge transfer has the effect of keeping the lower lying resonances fairly close to the fermi energy .",
    "up to 4 sulfur atoms on the gate were simulated , thus increasing the length of the barrier and further reducing the current as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for these longer chains the current rises at higher gate voltages as expected from the above arguments .    to gain further insight into the transport properties of these chains ,",
    "the differential conductance of the molecular wire with two sulfurs adsorbed on the gate is plotted at various gate voltages as a function of source - drain bias in fig .",
    "the figure shows at which source - drain bias and at which gate voltage optimal transistor action can be achieved .",
    "the top curve with filled circles corresponds to zero gate bias .",
    "the peaks in the conductance correspond to resonant transmission through the resonances near the fermi energy .",
    "the other graphs correspond to different reverse biases applied to the gate . for low source - drain voltages , the conductance of the molecule is clearly lowered due to the barrier being formed .",
    "however because the fermi energy of the leads resides near the edge of the lower band of resonant states as was discussed above , for sufficiently high source - drain biases , the molecule can be made to conduct appreciably even when a large reverse bias is applied to the gate .",
    "optimal transistor action can be achieved by operating in a regime where there are clearly high and low conducting states .",
    "this can be achieved at source - drain biases near 0 v by varying the gate bias from @xmath81 v to @xmath80 v. here the conductance varies from approximately 0.7 @xmath82 to 0.1 @xmath82 .",
    "other favourable operating voltages correspond to a source - drain bias around 1 v and a gate bias between @xmath83 and @xmath74 v. here the conductance varies between 0.5 @xmath82 and 0.2 @xmath82 .",
    "examination of the calculated fractional charge along the molecular chain also reveals some interesting phenomena .",
    "the results that follow are for the molecular wire with two sulfur atoms adsorbed on the gate . as mentioned above , undimerized chains were assumed in the calculation .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows results for the charge along the wire at zero gate bias .",
    "the plot in ( a ) corresponds a zero source - drain bias .",
    "the first thing to be noted is the charging at the contacts between the gold and the sulfurs .",
    "the gold loses charge and the sulfur acquires charge which leads to the formation of the schottky - like barrier seen in the previous plots of the potential . along the carbon chain a commensurate charge density wave with a period of 2 atomic spacings",
    "is formed .",
    "particularly interesting are the corresponding results shown in ( b ) for the charge along the chain when a 1 v source - drain bias is applied : the phases of the charge density wave at the two ends of the carbon chain are pinned by the chemical charge transfer that occurs there between the gold and sulfur atoms .",
    "thus when the applied source - drain bias breaks the left - right symmetry along the chain , the charge redistribution along the chain proceeds through the formation of a soliton anti - soliton pair along the wire ; the net charge of the soliton near the right end of the wire is negative and of that on the left is positive as one might expect intuitively based on the sign of the source - drain bias .",
    "notice also the associated @xmath0 phase shifts of the phase of the charge density wave across the soliton and across the anti - soliton  this is most easily seen by comparison with the phase of the charge density wave at zero source - drain bias shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) .    to gain further insight into the role of the solitons in this system ,",
    "consider the charge modulation along the wire at a gate voltage of -3 v that is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . in ( a ) the results for a zero source - drain bias are shown . in this case",
    "the phase of the charge density wave at the ends of the chain is pinned by the chemical charge transfer as before , but over the gate electrode it is pinned in _ anti - phase _ with the zero gate voltage case ( shown in fig . [ fig6](a ) ) by the interaction with the charged sulfur atoms on the gate . because of this there are two symmetric solitons near the ends of the wire in fig . [ fig7](a ) .",
    "in contrast to the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) , here _ both _",
    "solitons carry a net negative charge which is a manifestation of the symmetric redistribution of the electronic charge density from the center of the wire towards its ends in response to the negative bias voltage applied the gate .    when a 1  v source - drain bias is applied to this system ( fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) ) another soliton appears to be forming near the right end of the wire between the last two carbon atoms , again breaking the left - right symmetry of the charge distribution in response to the applied source - drain voltage .",
    "thus the system responds to the application of moderate gate or source - drain voltages through the formation of additional solitons along the wire .",
    "further investigation of the dynamics and energetics of the formation of solitons in these carbon chains and of the underlying physical mechanisms will clearly be of interest .",
    "in summary , we have provided a theoretical framework for modelling current flow and charging effects in multi - terminal molecular wire systems . included in our methodology",
