    "the purpose of a heat engine is to transform an amount of heat @xmath0 , extracted from a hot reservoir at temperature @xmath1 , into an amount of work @xmath2 .",
    "the efficiency @xmath3 for doing so is at most equal to carnot efficiency : @xmath4 , with @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the temperature of a second , cold reservoir @xmath7 , in which the remaining energy @xmath8 is deposited .",
    "the equality is reached for reversible operation , implying that the corresponding power output is zero .",
    "curzon and ahlborn were amongst the first to study the question of efficiency at maximum power  @xcite . by considering a simple modification of the carnot engine and after applying the so - called endo - reversible approximation ( neglecting dissipation in the auxiliary system ) , they found the following beautiful expression for the efficiency at maximum power : @xmath9 . while this formula appears to describe rather well the efficiency of actual thermal plants , and is close to the efficiency at maximum power for several model systems , it is neither an exact nor a universal result , and it is neither an upper nor a lower bound .",
    "it has therefore come as a surprise that a number of universal predictions can be made about the expansion of the efficiency at maximum power in terms of @xmath10 . in the regime of linear response ,",
    "i.e. , at first order in @xmath10 , it is found that the efficiency at maximum power is at most half of the carnot efficiency  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the ca efficiency is an upper bound at the level of linear response .",
    "the proof was given for systems operating under steady - state conditions .",
    "the upper bound is reached for so - called strongly coupled systems , i.e. , systems in which the heat flux and the work - producing flux are proportional to each other .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that the quadratic coefficient , equal to @xmath11 , is also universal for strongly coupled systems in the presence of an additional left - right symmetry in the system  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the universality of the coefficients is a direct consequence of the time - reversibility of the underlying physical laws .",
    "the coefficient @xmath12 derives from the symmetry of the onsager matrix .",
    "the coefficient @xmath11 can be seen as the implication of onsager symmetry at the level of nonlinear response .",
    "the above universality predictions have been confirmed in a number of steady - state model systems involving classical particles  @xcite , fermions  @xcite , and bosons  @xcite .",
    "universality has also been observed in variants of the ca model based on carnot cycles performed in finite time , even though finding the optimal driving protocol maximizing work extraction can be notoriously difficult  @xcite .",
    "the connection with the steady - state analysis has been clarified by identifying the onsager coefficient for a finite - time carnot cycle in the linear regime @xcite .",
    "furthermore , agreement with the universal quadratic coefficient has also been observed in a carnot cycle based on a ( classical ) brownian particle in an harmonic trap  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we provide a full analysis of a thermal engine undergoing a carnot cycle , with the auxiliary system consisting of a single - level quantum dot that is switched between a hot and a cold reservoir .",
    "we show that the efficiency at maximum power is again consistent with the above discussed universality .",
    "furthermore , ca efficiency at maximum power is obtained exactly at all orders in @xmath10 in the limit of low dissipation , which is distinct but similar to the case considered in the original ca paper .",
    "our heat engine model consists of a single - level quantum dot interacting with a metallic lead through a tunneling junction . the quantum dot is assumed to have a single energy level @xmath13 near the fermi level of the lead while other levels in the dot do not contribute to the processes described below .",
    "the state of the system is specified by the occupation probability @xmath14 of having an electron in the dot .",
    "the lead plays the role of a thermal bath at temperature @xmath15 and chemical potential @xmath16 .",
    "electrons are assumed to thermalize instantaneously upon tunnelling into the lead .",
    "when the energy level @xmath13 is modulated by an external agent according to a given protocol , a certain amount of energy , positive or negative , flows into the system in the form of work and/or heat . in the case of an occupied level , an amount of work equal to @xmath17 is delivered to the system , where the subscripts @xmath18 and @xmath19 refer to final and initial values . when the electrons at energy level @xmath13 tunnel in ( out ) , an amount of heat equal to @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is extracted from the bath .",
    "the basic problem that we address is the finite - time performance of this engine as it runs through the following four standard stages of a carnot cycle ( also see figure [ fig : model ] ) :    * _ isothermal process _ + the quantum",
    "dot is in contact with a cold lead at temperature @xmath6 and chemical potential @xmath22 .",
    "the energy level is raised from @xmath23 to @xmath24 according to a certain protocol during a time interval of duration @xmath25 .",
    "both work and heat are exchanged during this process .",
    "* _ adiabatic process _",
    "+ the quantum dot is disconnected from the cold lead , and the quantum level is shifted from @xmath24 to a new level @xmath26 . since the quantum dot is thermodynamically isolated , the population of the level does not change during this process .",
    "hence , there is no heat exchange .",
    "however , the change of the energy level releases a corresponding amount of work .",
    "we assume that the operation time of this step is very short , in particular negligibly small compared to that of the isothermal processes . * _ isothermal process _",
    "+ the dot is connected to the hot lead at temperature @xmath1 and chemical potential @xmath27 .",
    "the energy level is lowered from @xmath26 to @xmath28 based on another protocol during a time interval of length @xmath29 . just as in step",
    "i , both heat and work are exchanged . * _ adiabatic process _ + the system is again disconnected from the lead and the level is restored from @xmath28 to the initial level @xmath23 , at the cost of a corresponding amount of work .",
    "afterwards , the dot is reconnected to the cold lead . again",
    ", we assume that the operation time of this process is negligibly small .",
    "the above procedure defines one cycle of the thermal engine , requiring a total time @xmath30 .",
    "the protocols in steps i and iii must be designed in such a way that the thermodynamic state of the system , in our case the occupation probability @xmath31 of the quantum level , returns to the same initial value after every cycle .",
    "since there is no change in occupation probability during the adiabatic stages ii and iv , the change in occupation probability from , say @xmath32 to @xmath33 , during process i , must necessarily be compensated by a change back from @xmath33 to @xmath32 during process iii .",
    "the time evolution of the occupation probability @xmath14 for the state of the quantum dot in contact with a lead at temperature @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) obeys the following quantum master equation : @xmath36 , \\label{eq : master}\\ ] ] where the @xmath37 and @xmath38 are transition rates . in the wide - band approximation ,",

    "noting that raising the energy level is equivalent to lowering the chemical potential , we introduce an effective energy level @xmath41 . the master equation  ( [ eq : master ] )",
    "can now be rewritten as @xmath42 the effective level varies along the carnot cycle as @xmath43 .",
    "note that the change in the chemical potential is included in the jump of the effective level during processes ii and iv .",
    "we next turn to the thermodynamic description of the model .",
    "we use the convention that heat entering the system is ( like work ) positive . the internal energy of the system at time @xmath44 is @xmath45 where @xmath46 the rate of change of the internal energy , @xmath47 , is the sum of two parts , namely , a work flux @xmath48 and a heat flux @xmath49 ,    @xmath50    note that the particle exchange contributes to the heat flux [ last term in eq .",
    "( [ heatflux ] ) ] .",
    "when the energy level is below the chemical potential , the direction of heat flow is opposite to the direction of tunnelling .",
    "the net total work and net total heat during the process of duration @xmath51 are obtained as functionals of the occupation probability ,    @xmath52 & = & \\int_{0}^{\\tau }   \\dot{\\epsilon}(t ) p(t ) { \\mathrm{d}t } \\label{eq : w } \\\\",

    "we evaluate power using net heat instead of net work : @xmath55",
    "our goal is to maximize the power output and to evaluate the corresponding efficiency .",
    "power is a complicated functional of the time - dependent protocols in stage i and iii , and an exact analytical analysis looks difficult at first sight .",
    "the optimization can however be done in two steps .",
    "first , we fix parameter values , @xmath25 , @xmath29 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 and maximize the power with respect to the functional space of @xmath56 .",
    "since the total operation time is fixed , we just need to maximize the heat .",
    "next , we further maximize the power with respect to the remaining degrees of freedom @xmath25 , @xmath29 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the problem of maximizing heat or minimizing work for a single - level quantum dot moving between given initial and final energy states has already been analysed in detail in @xcite .",
    "we reproduce the crucial steps of this analysis for self - consistency .    to find the protocol that maximizes the heat , we do not search directly for the optimal schedule @xmath56 , but identify the optimal occupation probability @xmath14 .",

    "instead , we can also use the state of holes , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . if @xmath14 is a solution for an upward process",
    ", then @xmath67 is a solution for a downward process with @xmath66 .",
    "hence we do not need to calculate the downward process separately , as it follows from this symmetry .    before turning to the solution of the differential equation ( [ eq : ode ] )",
    ", we examine the physical meaning of the constant @xmath61 . eliminating @xmath62 in eq .",

    "( [ eq : general ] ) only provides an implicit equation for the time - dependence of the optimal schedule .",
    "we are , however , mainly interested in the verification of universal features of efficiency at maximum power .",
    "we therefore proceed with a perturbative analysis for which analytic solutions can be obtained .",
    "the deviation from carnot efficiency can be investigated using the theory of linear irreversible thermodynamics where @xmath98 is assumed to be smaller than the temperatures @xmath1 and @xmath6 of the reservoirs .",

    "hence , it is natural to expand thermodynamic quantities in @xmath61 .",

    "once we find the value of @xmath61 , the remaining calculation is straightforward .",

    "the second term on the right hand side is the irreversible heat , which has to be small under the condition ( [ eq : condition1 ] ) of weak dissipation . in the quasi - static limit ( @xmath70 ) , the second term vanishes and the efficiency ( [ eq : exact_eta ] ) reaches the carnot efficiency , as expected .    when the operation time is too short , the irreversible heat becomes dominant and the net heat becomes negative .",
    "equation ( [ eq : optq ] ) indicates that positive power can be obtained only if @xmath109 this inequality is consistent with the condition of the asymptotic expansion ( [ eq : condition1 ] ) and can thus be satisfied even for a large temperature difference .",
    "so far , we have maximized the power only for the fixed operation times @xmath25 and @xmath29 and the boundary values @xmath32 and @xmath33 of the occupation probabilities .",
    "now we further maximize the power @xmath110 with respect to the operation times .",
    "it is easy to find that the power is a maximum when    [ eq : opttau ] @xmath111",
    "this optimization reflects the usual competition with the denominator of the power preferring faster operation whereas the numerator suggests a slower schedule to stay closer to carnot efficiency .    for the asymptotic expansion to be valid , the optimal operation times",
    "must satisfy the condition ( [ eq : condition1 ] ) of weak dissipation .",
    "that is , for the process iii the following inequality must be satisfied : @xmath112 this can be achieved in two ways .",
    "the first one corresponds to the usual condition for linear irreversible thermodynamics , @xmath113 .",
    "the alternative is @xmath114 . in this limit ,",
    "our result remains valid even for large temperature differences .    with the optimized operation times ( [ eq : opttau ] ) ,",
    "the resulting power is written as a function of @xmath32 and @xmath33 : @xmath115 where @xmath116 the power reaches its maximum when @xmath117 takes a maximum value , @xmath118 at @xmath119 or @xmath120 . at these conditions , the optimal operation time ( [ eq : opttau ] ) and the maximum heat ( [ eq : optq ] ) both vanish .",
    "however , the power remains finite .",
    "this final optimization thus leads to a singular and unrealistic situation .",
    "we note , however , that since eq .",
    "( [ eq : d ] ) does not depend on the system parameters , the efficiency does in fact not depend on this final optimization step .",
    "therefore , we proceed to evaluate efficiency without further reference to optimal occupation probabilities .    using the maximum heat ( [ eq : optq ] ) and the optimal time ( [ eq : opttau ] ) , we finally obtain the following remarkable result for the efficiency at the maximum power : @xmath121 with @xmath122 . when @xmath123 , the efficiency ( [ eq : eta_maxp ] ) exactly coincides with the curzon - ahlborn efficiency @xmath124 .",
    "note also that the efficiency is bounded below by @xmath125 for @xmath126 and bounded above by @xmath127 for @xmath128 .",
    "these limits can be realized without violating the condition of weak dissipation .",
    "we have calculated the efficiency @xmath129 at maximum power of a carnot cycle with a single level quantum dot as the operational device .",
    "our calculation is in agreement with known universality properties . in particular , the efficiency at maximum power is equal to half of the carnot efficiency in the regime of linear response , @xmath130 . in the case of a left / right symmetry , corresponding to equal exchange rate coefficients @xmath131 of the dot with the heat reservoirs , the coefficient of the quadratic term is also given by its universal value @xmath11 , @xmath132 .",
    "however , we need to stress that this result was obtained not by an expansion in @xmath10 but in the limit of weak dissipation .",
    "in fact , this calculation adds a new perspective concerning the occurrence of curzon - ahlborn efficiency itself . indeed , in the presence of left",
    "/ right symmetry , the efficiency is actually _ exactly _ equal to the ca efficiency @xmath133 , in the limit of _ weak dissipation_. this limit is reminiscent of the original derivation of ca efficiency , and is in the present model formally similar to the assumption of a linear conduction law between reservoir and quantum dot .",
    "however the concept of weak dissipation is more general .",
    "it remains to be explored whether this observation implies a wider range of validity of ca efficiency .",
    "in particular , it could explain why observed efficiencies at maximum power are not very different from ca efficiency in a wide range of systems under operational conditions far from linear response .",
    "in general , heat absorbed by the system can be written in the following form : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is irreversible entropy production .",
