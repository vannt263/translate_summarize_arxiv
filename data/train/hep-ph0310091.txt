    "the pursuit of high and ultra - high energy neutrinos has greatly intensified over the past decade as more and more neutrino telescopes have entered the search .",
    "though the observation of mev - neutrinos emitted from sn 1987a is over 15 years old @xcite , @xcite , there is still no firm candidate for tev , pev or eev neutrinos of galactic or extra - galactic origin .",
    "yet there is good reason to expect a neutrino flux exists in this energy regime because of the great success of air - shower detectors in building a detailed record of cosmic rays with these very - high to ultra - high energies @xcite .",
    "the photons or nuclear particles that are generally believed to initiate the observed shower are accompanied by neutrinos with similar energies , in most models of the high - energy particle emission by the sources . in any case , the neutrinos emitted by production and decay of pions by the highest energy primary cosmic rays as they interact with the cosmic microwave background , the so - called gzk @xcite neutrinos , should be present at some level at ultra - high energies @xcite , regardless of the mechanism responsible for producing the observed cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "even if there are no super - gzk neutrinos , there are a number of models @xcite , which predict the existence of neutrinos in the pev - eev range . by choosing several contrasting flux models and using enhanced cross sections from low scale gravity @xcite",
    ", we look for new physics effects that are relatively independent of flux models .    the expanding experimental capabilities and the strong theoretical interest in understanding the physics of astrophysical sources and particle interactions of the highest energy cosmic rays makes it imperative to study all aspects of the neutrino observation process .",
    "the number of groups reporting limits on fluxes and projecting improved limits with expanded data sets or with new facilities is impressive . in the range 1 tev to 1 pev",
    ", the amanda @xcite , frejus @xcite , macro @xcite and baikal @xcite experiments have reported limits on neutrinos from astrophysical ( non - atmospheric ) sources . in the range 1 pev to 1 eev ,",
    "agasa @xcite , amanda @xcite , fly s eye @xcite , and rice @xcite have all reported limits . above 1 eev , agasa , fly s eye , glue @xcite and rice all put limits on the flux that extend up into the gzk range .",
    "the upper limits are getting interestingly close to the predictions of several models and actually below the predictions in several cases .",
    "the situation is heating up and will get hotter as the experiments like auger , which is already reporting preliminary results on air showers @xcite and icecube @xcite are fully operational .",
    "meanwhile , expanded data sets and improvements in sensitivity in experiments like rice will continue to search and to push down on limits until the first uhe neutrinos are observed @xcite .",
    "these detection capabilities that have been achieved and will be improved and expanded in the next few years have direct impact on particle physics .",
    "the detection estimates , upon which limits are based , all rely on the extrapolation of neutrino cross sections well beyond the currently measured energy range .",
    "is qcd correctly predicting these cross sections @xcite ?",
    "is there new physics that enhances neutrino cross sections at high energies @xcite ?",
    "what is the effect of new neutrino interactions @xcite or neutrino mixing @xcite on the expected rates of detection in various telescopes ? clearly there is ample motivation for examining the consequences of various combinations of assumptions about the physics governing the cross sections and the assumptions about the flavor composition of the astrophysical flux of neutrinos .",

    "our results confirm significant regeneration effect due to taus in the sm as already shown by several authors @xcite .",
    "however , as we will see the regeneration due to taus is not as significant in lsg models .",
    "also , by comparing results of @xcite , one finds that electromagnetic ( em ) losses of @xmath10 are not making a significant difference in the sm  fluxes of @xmath2 around 1pev , hence , we do not include em losses in our work here .",
    "as we will see in the next section , em  losses are not important at all in lsg  models .",

    "before evaluating the equations of propagation for the four leptons @xmath12 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath10 through the earth in next section , we need to calculate their cross sections on isoscalar nucleons ( @xmath13 ) , where n stands for neutron and p for proton .",

    "we have six candidates which might be coupled with each other : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and their three leptonic partners .",

    "@xmath69 needs some attention because it is different in sm and lsg . in sm",
    "we can ignore @xmath70 but not @xmath17 because of the comparatively smaller decay length and larger em ranges of taus .",
    "for lsg , muons play some role in the propagation through the earth at high enough energy as explained below .",
    "the effect is quite small , however .",
    "if we look at the interaction lengths and @xmath10-decay length in fig.2 , we find that : ( i ) the lsg1 model ( lsg model with mass scale 1tev ) interaction lengths become smaller than the @xmath10-decay length for @xmath71 .",
    "this implies the regeneration effect due to taus will be suppressed in lsg models ( ii ) if we look at the em ranges of taus @xcite , we find that the lsg1 model interaction lengths become smaller than the tau em range for @xmath72 .",
    "this gives a reason for not including , in lsg , the em energy losses of taus in our propagation of neutrinos , coupled with taus , through the earth .",
    "( iii ) if we look at the em ranges of muons @xcite , we find that even the muon em energy losses are not important for @xmath73 ( iv ) given the above reasons , interestingly , taus and muons become almost identical in lsg for @xmath73 this means one may have to treat muons and taus on equal footing in the propagation of neutrinos through the earth for @xmath71 in lsg1 model and for @xmath74 in lsg2 model ( lsg model with mass scale 2tev ) . however , in the present work , we do not include muons in the propagation equations because we are looking at neutrinos around 1pev here , and we expect the coupling of muons with the @xmath1 via cc interaction for @xmath71 will not affect the neutrino flux much around 1pev by feed down ; the muon decay length , being so large in contrast to that of @xmath75 will play no role in regeneration of @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "below we show results for total fluxes , including all the neutrino species and their respective antineutrinos , unless defined otherwise .",
    "we plot upward fluxes instead of up - to - down flux ratios to find the region in the @xmath100-space to compare the sm and lsg models in terms of absolute flux differences .",
    "larger fluxes mean more events , and larger difference in the number of neutrinos in sm and lsg means better chances to differentiate between the models .",
    "the ratio plots are not always helpful for that purpose because they do not show us the actual number of neutrinos and the flux difference of the sm and lsg .",
    "we present plots for @xmath101 , @xmath102 in the @xmath103-space , where , @xmath104 and ,    @xmath105    here @xmath106 , @xmath107 are the total upward fluxes in the low scale gravity models with mass scale 1tev and 2tev respectively , and number of extra dimensions @xmath62 .",

    "below we show our analysis for the neutrino flux models due to r. j. protheroe @xcite , k. mannheim ( b ) @xcite , waxman bahcall @xcite , sdss @xcite , and 1/e generic model . though we did not show it here , we also looked at atmospheric and galactic neutrinos @xcite around 0.5pev .",
    "however , the up fluxes in this case are ignorable as compared to the above extragalactic flux models : the galactic up flux is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the up flux from any of the flux models considered here ; the atmospheric up flux is more than two orders of magnitude lower than even the galactic up flux .",
    "the reason is quite simple : one should expect larger feed down in the upward model fluxes considered here ; these extragalactic models have much larger fluxes above 1pev than the atmospheric or galactic fluxes . as a result ,",
    "the model fluxes at higher energies give larger feed down at 0.5pev while the atmospheric and galactic up fluxes are so small there that they give essentially no feed down .",
    "this is especially true in sm because of the strong feed down effect per incident @xmath2 due to tau decays , which may make the extragalactic model up fluxes , in sm , large enough to be detectable even at 0@xmath113 nadir angles around 0.5pev .",
    "we will first show some plots ( figs .",
    "4 - 14 ) to explore @xmath103-space of the neutrino fluxes , and finally we will give two tables of numbers for different neutrino flavor flux ratios .",
    "three types of plots are shown below :    * ( i ) fluxes integrated over energy vs nadir angle : * figs .",
    "4 and 5 refer to our example of r. j. protheroe @xcite model .",
    "4 shows the angular distribution of the total sm flux @xmath114 integrated over energy @xmath115 along with the flux differences @xmath116 and @xmath110 as defined in the eqs.[df1 ] and [ df2 ] .",
    "the qualitative features of the figs.4 and 5 are the same in every flux model , so we do not show figures for the other flux models corresponding to fig.4 .",
    "however , we show the corresponding figures for fig . 5 for the four models ( r. j. protheroe @xcite , k. mannheim ( b ) @xcite , waxman bahcall @xcite , sdss @xcite ) because our emphasis here is on @xmath10-effects , and we wish to show their qualitative features are independent of the flux model .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the atmospheric and galactic @xcite up fluxes are not significant as compared to the four extragalactic source models at these energies , so we do not consider them here@xmath117    we plot the upward fluxes in two scenarios for the initial flux : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath4 , @xmath8 , @xmath8 ( solid lines ) and @xmath0 , @xmath118 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the two scenarios correspond to @xmath119 oscillations and no oscillations in space , respectively .",
    "the following observations are common to all models and are relevant to fig . 4 : ( i ) the difference is largest in number around 75@xmath113 - 85@xmath113 ; however , as we will see in 3d plots in @xmath100-space , the maximum of the difference shifts to lower angles at lower energies , ( ii ) around 30@xmath113 nadir angle",
    ", one can clearly see the effect of the core stronger suppression , ( iii ) the difference in flux between sm and lsg models is larger at any angle in the @xmath0 , @xmath11 , @xmath4 , @xmath8 , @xmath8 scenario than in the no tau scenario .",
    "this is expected because of the stronger tau regeneration effect in the sm as compared to lsg ; in lsg , the black hole cross section , being the largest of all as shown in fig . 1",
    ", suppresses regeneration due to any process .",
    "this observation leads us to concentrate on tau fluxes only , as discussed below .    in figs . 5 - 8 we show the same plots for @xmath2 as was shown for the total fluxes .",
    "we plot these figures for all the four models : r. j. protheroe @xcite , k. mannheim ( b ) @xcite , waxman bahcall @xcite , and sdss @xcite . in these figures ,",
    "the solid line is the @xmath2 flux in sm and the two dotted lines are the difference fluxes ( see eqs.[df1 ] , [ df2 ] ) for @xmath2 .",
    "we clearly see that in lsg1 model , regardless of the flux model , difference in @xmath2 fluxes is more than 50 % of the total difference due to all neutrino species .",
    "for example , the @xmath2 difference @xmath116 ( fig .",
    "5 ) for protheroe model at 0@xmath113 nadir angle is around @xmath120 , while the total difference is around 4000 ( fig .",
    "4 ) , @xmath121 this behavior is independent of the flux models about 3/4 of the total difference is due to @xmath76 only .",
    "this may be useful as icecube is expected to differentiate between neutrino flavors around 500 tev @xcite .    * ( ii ) flux integrated over nadir angle vs energy : * the fluxes integrated over nadir angle do not show as much detail as the ones integrated over energy .",
    "this is because the integrated flux gets dominant contribution from nadir angles around 90@xmath113 where the chord length of the earth is not long enough to make the difference between sm and lsg prominent .",
    "for this reason , it suffices to show plots for only one flux model , chosen to be the r. j. protheroe model @xcite ; also the qualitative features of these plots , like the earlier plots , are model independent so it is not important to show the figures for all the models .",
    "we see in fig . 9 : ( a ) even at energies @xmath122 , the lsg1 and sm flux models are distinguishable ; ( b ) in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath123 , @xmath8 , @xmath8 scenario , @xmath116 and @xmath110 are larger at lower energies",
    ", however , in contrast in the @xmath0 , @xmath14 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 scenario , they decrease with decreasing energy .",
    "this contrasting behavior of the two scenarios begins around 1pev for lsg1 and around 5pev for lsg2 .",
    "this is expected because the stronger feed down effect due to taus causes @xmath124 in the @xmath0 , @xmath11 , @xmath4 , @xmath8 , @xmath8 scenario to increase faster with decreasing energy than in the other scenario ; however , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are not as different in the two scenarios because they are not as sensitive to tau regeneration .",
    "hence , the over all result is decreasing flux difference for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath127 scenario and increasing flux difference for the other scenario .",
    "this happens at a lower energy in the lsg1 model due to the lower energy scale for lsg1 ( figs.1 , 2 ) ; ( c ) another important observation is that @xmath128 is almost equal to @xmath124 after 3pev , which means if we want to differentiate the two models on the basis of the nadir angle integrated event rates , the best region in energy may be around 3pev , if the detector has large enough efficiency to detect this flux",
    ". however , obtaining larger fluxes for better statistics requires looking at lower energies .",
    "though the model fluxes around energies as low as 100 tev are larger , the percent difference between sm and lsg fluxes becomes smaller and smaller at energies below 0.5pev where sm cross sections are dominant ; the total upward flux rises much faster than the flux difference , making it hard to differentiate between the two models .",
    "the atmospheric background is also larger at these energies , hence we did not find it interesting to show the fluxes below 0.5pev .    in fig .",
    "10 we plot the nadir angle integrated flux of @xmath2 only .",
    "if we compare fig . 9 and 10 , we come up with the similar answer as we did for the flux integrated over energy ( @xmath129 : the upward @xmath2 flux difference , @xmath130 around 0.5pev is almost 3/4 of the total upward flux difference @xmath131 .",
    "this again gives one hope that the signals of low scale gravity may appear even around 0.5pev .    *",
    "( iii ) plots of flux as a function of both energy and nadir angle : * figs.11 - 14 give the complete detail of the fluxes in the @xmath103-space for our flux example of r. j. protheroe @xcite . in figs .",
    "11 and 12 we plot the total upward flux in sm , @xmath132 and the total upward flux difference @xmath133 respectively ; figs .",
    "13 and 14 have similar plots for the @xmath134 we can see in these plots : ( a ) the difference is the largest around 80@xmath113 , however , it is still increasing even at 0.5pev .",
    "again , this may be surprising at first glance because below 1pev there is no significant contribution to the cross sections from lsg .",
    "however , the reason is simply that the cross section at a given energy will affect the neutrino flux at equal _ and lower _ energies due to feed down . keeping this in mind",
    ", we can argue that the flux around 1pev or below gets more feed down from higher energies in sm because lsg black hole cross section , being the largest of all the cross sections , suppresses the feed down effect due to any process .",
    "( b ) at higher energies the flux difference peaks at higher angles e.g. around 80@xmath135 the peak shifts to lower angles at lower energies .",
    "one may argue that the peak should always occur at the lowest nadir angle because the neutrinos will have more interactions as they pass through earth with larger chord lengths , and hence the sm and lsg models interaction will cause the flux differences to become larger and larger at lower angles and higher energies . however",
    ", this does not happen because the input fluxes at higher energies are so small that at lower nadir angles all the flux is either absorbed or fed down to lower energies ; that is why we see the flux difference peak shifts towards 0@xmath136 nadir angle at lower energies : feed down effect makes the difference , between sm and lsg , at higher energies appear at lower energies .",
    "( c ) the @xmath2 plots in figs .",
    "13 , 14 show us that the major contributor of the difference between sm and lsg is the @xmath2 at lower energies .",
    "it contributes almost 3/4 of the total difference around 0.5pev and around 1/3 at 10pev .",
    "this feature is best seen in these full @xmath100-space plots . around energies 0.5pev , @xmath2 plays important role in probing new physics . at energies around 10pev and higher",
    ", @xmath137 behaves more like @xmath0 and @xmath138 this is because around these energies the feed down due to taus , from even higher energies , is not a big effect both in sm and lsg .",
    "this is a result of larger tau decay lengths , smaller interaction lengths ( see figs . 1 , 2 ) , and smaller fluxes at higher energies .    summarizing",
    ", we see that the above analysis discloses the flux structure @xmath139-space : ( i ) around 0.5pev , the flux difference peaks in the @xmath140 region . the larger angles tend to wash out the difference between lsg and sm .",
    "( ii ) around 5pev , the difference peaks in the @xmath141 region . (",
    "iii ) at higher energies , one will have to look at even larger nadir angles to get any detectable up flux .",

    "these ratios reveal some interesting and useful features : ( i ) if we compare @xmath143 and @xmath144 with @xmath142 in the tables  [ tab : table1 ] and [ tab : table2 ] , we find that @xmath76 flux indeed behaves differently in sm and lsg .",
    "( ii ) in lsg , at higher energies , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 tend to become identical as expected from larger decay length of taus at higher energies and larger black hole cross sections hence smaller feed down of @xmath137 from tau decays ; this effect is indeed seen for lsg ( 1tev ) ( see g1 in table  [ tab : table2 ] ) ; @xmath142 and @xmath143 tend to become equal and @xmath146 tends to become 0.5 as expected ( see g1 in table  [ tab : table2 ] ) .",
    "the same will be true for lsg ( 2tev ) at even higher energies.(iii ) no matter which neutrino flux model is correct , even at energies as low as 0.5pev , we see a clear difference between sm and lsg ( 1tev ) model ( table  [ tab : table1 ] ) ; at higher energies , @xmath147 there should be a difference between lsg(2tev ) and sm based on their their comparison at 5pev ( table  [ tab : table2 ] ) .",
    "our data at 10pev which is not shown here , implies that , based on the flux ratios , the % difference between lsg(2tev ) and sm at 10pev is bigger than the one between lsg ( 1tev ) and sm at 5pev.(iv ) isolating @xmath2 should help differentiate between sm and lsg , and may help to differentiate between different neutrino flux models given sm dynamics .",

    "we found complete numerical solutions to the system of coupled equations that include the most important effects for transport through earth of @xmath155 and @xmath10 fluxes above 0.5 pev . in fig .",
    "4 , we presented results of angular distributions of total neutrino flux in our example of the diffuse flux model by r. j. protheroe @xcite , however , the qualitative features of this figure are common to the other flux models ( k. mannheim ( b ) @xcite , waxman bahcall @xcite , and sdss @xcite )",
    ". fluxes in this figure are integrated from 0.5 pev upward , showing the effects of including low scale gravity enhancement to the lepton deep inelastic cross sections , _ with no @xmath2 and full @xmath76 mixing into the incident flux .",
    "_ this figure also show that the @xmath137 regeneration from @xmath10 decay enhances the `` through earth '' , or `` upward '' fluxes significantly more in the standard model than in the models with low scale gravity enhancements included , as seen on the curves where @xmath2 is mixed into the flux incident on earth .",
    "the standard model flux is obviously higher at nadir angles smaller than 80 degrees , while the differences between the fluxes with standard model interactions only and those with low scale gravity included are much larger at small nadir angles in the case that @xmath2 is mixed into the incident flux than in the case when there it is not .",
    "next in figs .",
    "5 - 8 , we showed the equivalent angular distributions for the @xmath2 flux alone to emphasize the observation just summarized , that is , as compared to @xmath7 and @xmath156 @xmath2 can serve better to differentiate between sm and lsg at energies below 10pev .",
    "as established by the angular distribution graphs , the qualitative features are shared by all the models , so we gave only the protheroe model results in plotting the energy distribution of flux integrated over angles in the range from 0.5 pev to 20 pev in figs .",
    "these plots show that in this energy range , the low scale gravity interactions rapidly suppress the upward flux compared to the standard model .",
    "they also indicate the fact that the regeneration of @xmath2 flux is much less significant when low scale gravity is turned on , as clearly indicated by the flux difference curves in the energy range between 0.5 pev and 2.0 pev .    in the series of graphs from figs.11 through 14 , we displayed the three - dimensional plots of the total and @xmath157 fluxes for the standard model and for the low scale gravity , m = 1 tev case .",
    "these indicate in detail where the maximum flux differences are in angle and energy .",
    "next we looked at the flux ratios @xmath153 @xmath154 and @xmath144 as defined in eqs .",
    "[ eqratio ] .",
    "the results are given in tables  [ tab : table1 ] and [ tab : table2 ] . here again the distinction between @xmath2 and @xmath158 fluxes is evident .",
    "the distinctions among flux models are largely washed out by the lsg dynamics at higher energies .",
    "for example , in table  [ tab : table2 ] , @xmath142 and @xmath143 are the same for all the flux models given here .    in sections v and",
    "vi we presented the defining equations for our shower , muon and tau rates and the results of our rate calculation .",
    "the story is summarized in tables iii - vi . using a cutoff of 0.5pev",
    ", we found that the events rates in showers and muon categories are large enough to make meaningful statements about the distinction between sm and lsg with a 1 tev , in all flux models and both flavor scenarios with a 2 - 3 years of running .",
    "an interesting feature of the lsg ( 2tev ) entries in tables  [ tab : table3 ] and  [ tab : table4 ] is that the down shower events may be enhanced enough compared to sm to distinguish between the two in wb , mb , and pr , and possibly sd too .",
    "the ratio of ratios in tables  [ tab : table4 ] and  [ tab : table6 ] compares the lsg shower down / muon up ratios to the ones for sm .",
    "table iv and vi also show the same for taus down / taus up .",
    "this diagnostic is especially sensitive to the difference between sm and lsg .",
    "it also shows us that this ratio of the ratios for showers and muons is almost the same in both of the flavor scenarios .",
    "the importance of the taus in differentiating between sm and lsg ( 1 tev ) is realized by looking at the tagged tau events ( tables iv and vi ) . for tagged tau events , the difference between lsg ( 1 tev ) and the sm varies from an order of magnitude to two orders of magnitude for energy thresholds of 0.5 - 5 pev .",
    "however , we caution the reader again that the statistics are low in this case . _ basically the tau story can be summarized by saying that any upward tau event establishes ( 1 ) @xmath159 s presence in the neutrino flux incident on earth ( 2 ) exclusion of lsg with 1 tev scale or any model of enhanced cross section of comparable size in the 1 - 10 pev range .",
    "_    the 5 pev threshold results in table v and vi show the same patterns as in the 0.5pev tables .",
    "the distinction between sm and lsg ( 2 tev ) are now sharper in the ratios , but the statistics in some cases are low , so that one needs to have 5 - 10 years of data to draw strong conclusions that apply to all flux models .",
    "we conclude on the basis of our flux and event rate study that with a threshold of 0.5 pev , the shower and muon event ratios have sufficient events in all flux and lepton flavor models to make clear distinctions between sm and lsg with a mass scale 2 tev and below .",
    "going above 2 tev , one finds that whether distinctions can be made depende upon the flux model .",
    "the situation is not so clear .",
    "because the requirements on @xmath159 identification are so stringent , only a few events to a fraction of an event will be expected , depending upon flux model , up or down event and lsg scale value .",
    "one point is perfectly clear : any upward tau event excludes lsg with a scale around 1tev .",
