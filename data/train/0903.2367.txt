    "the maps of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation are among important sources of cosmological information .",
    "various descriptors have been applied to study the non - gaussianities in the cmb temperature maps .",
    "kolmogorov stochasticity parameter ( k - parameter ) [ [ kolm],[arnold],[arnold1 ] ] when applied to cmb temperature datasets[[gk_ksp],[k_sky ] ] reveals the galactic disk , hence , outlining the differences in the statistical properties of the disk radiation and that of cmb .",
    "the resulting kolmogorov s map shows enhanced randomness , i.e. higher value of k - parameter in certain regions including the cold spot [ [ cruz ] ] , the non - gaussian anomaly in the southern sky .",
    "notably , the k - parameter of the cold spot satisfies the criterion expected for the voids , namely , increase of the randomness towards the walls of the void which act as hyperbolic ( deviating ) lenses for the cmb [ [ gk_void ] , [ das_sp ] ] .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the analysis of the interplay between the properties of datasets , which are crucial at separation of signals of different stochasticity ( randomness ) characteristics .",
    "first , we obtain the k - map for w and v bands of wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data , which indicate the differences in the statistic at different contribution of the galactic radiation .",
    "we then estimate the k - parameter for datasets of gaussian , along with a perturbed gaussian distributions .",
    "we start with the definition of the kolmogorov statistic [ [ kolm ] ] .",
    "for a finite random sequence of numbers the kolmogorov s theorem [ [ kolm ] ] aims to determine its stochastic ( randomness ) properties . consider a sequence of real numbers @xmath0 and that @xmath1 . having a continuous distribution function    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the probability of event in brackets .",
    "the empirical distribution function is defined as    @xmath4    kolmogorov s stochasticity parameter is defined as    @xmath5    which according to the theorem is a random number defined by a distribution function @xmath6 that tends to a function @xmath7 uniformly when @xmath8 , for any continous distribution @xmath9    @xmath10    where    @xmath11    from figure [ fig : fi ] we see that the most probable values of @xmath12 are between 0.3 and 2.2 .     (",
    "a ) and it s derivative @xmath13 ( b).,title=\"fig:\",width=2 ]   ( a ) and it s derivative @xmath13 ( b).,title=\"fig:\",width=2 ]    this means that for big enough @xmath14 and random sequence @xmath15 the kolmogorov s stochasticity parameter @xmath16 will have a distribution close to @xmath7 and if the sequence is not random , the distribution will be different .",
    "this gives us an opportunity to test the randomness of a sequence .",
    "note , that for each studied sequence we can only get one value of @xmath16 , so that it is not possible to guess whether that number belongs to a certain distribution .",
    "here we have an option to split a sequence into subsets , if the length of the sequence , @xmath14 , is big enough .",
    "consider a split of the sequence @xmath15 into @xmath17 subsequences .",
    "we can get a new sequence @xmath18 of length @xmath17 , which should be a random sequence with distribution close to @xmath7 .",
    "so @xmath18 is our option to proceed on the sequences .",
    "the k - maps for the w and v bands of the wmap 5-year data are given in fig.2 .",
    "the visible differences are due to the different role of the galactic disk contribution , i.e. of a perturbation .",
    "we will now model such an effect for the k - parameter .",
    "our first aim is to find parameters and ranges for their values that will show whether we are dealing with stochastic sequence or no .",
    "the stochastic sequence can be resulted e.g. from a hyperbolic dynamical system [ [ arnold_book ] ] but can also have another origin .",
    "the length of the considered sequences are taken as 4096 which corresponds to the cmb maps in given healpix format of pixelization .",
    "we generate sequences of given length with certain properties , namely , we take 400 different sequences that are divided into 4 following groups each having 100 sequence :    1st hundred are random sequences with gaussian distribution ;    2nd hundred are random sequences with perturbed gaussian distribution ;    3rd hundred are sequences with gaussian distribution , but they are not random but are extracted from a periodic sequence like @xmath19 @xmath14 mod @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath20 are constants ;    4th hundred are sequences including two copies of the same random gaussian sequence .",
    "our choice of gaussian distribution for @xmath9 is due to its interest for cmb maps , but in principle , it could be anything including a uniform distribution .",
    "so we have groups 1 and 2 that are stochastic and 3 and 4 which are non stochastic , and we can proceed with calculations for all sequences . in all figures the horizontal axis",
    "@xmath22 denotes the index of a sequence that runs from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , i.e. if @xmath25 we have values of the 1st group , if @xmath26 for the 2nd group , and so on .",
    "figure [ fig : test_1 ] shows results of computations . in the [ fig : test_1].a the values of @xmath12 are shown for each sequence , we see correspondence to distribution @xmath7 for 1st and 2nd groups , but not for 3rd or 4th ones .",
    "figure [ fig : test_1].b contains similar plot for values @xmath7 , in this case 1st and 2nd groups should have almost uniformly distributed values between 0 and 1 , but not 3rd or 4th , and this is what we see .",
    "figure [ fig : test_1].c shows that values @xmath27 are close to 1 in 1st and 2nd case , indicating right distribution again .    finally , [ fig : test_1].d , is the @xmath28 calculated for each sequence s distribution as compared with theoretical gaussian distribution .",

    "the first 3 sequences do not allow to conclude whether a single sequence at index @xmath22 is random or not , and the 4th figure of @xmath28 can not really distinguish the 3rd and 4th from the 1st and 2nd , as this is only information on distribution , not connected with randomness .",
    "when we split the sequences and obtain @xmath17 different values @xmath18 for each sequence , we can compute their mean value , @xmath29 .",
    "also we can define empiric distribution function @xmath30 for @xmath18 in similar way to [ eq : empiricdistribution ] , and calculate the distance of that function from the theoretical one @xmath7 - @xmath31 .",
    "the following are the results of calculations with split of each sequence .",
    "there are two parameters , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 both parameters show that a sequence is closer to a random one , the closer is their value to 0 .     and @xmath31.,title=\"fig:\",width=2 ]   and @xmath31.,title=\"fig:\",width=2 ]",
    "figure [ fig : test_2 ] shows that the sequence is stochastic if @xmath35 or if @xmath36 and is non - stochastic otherwise .",
    "these two criteria do not distinguish the 1st and 2nd groups from each other since we are dealing with small subsequences that do not `` feel '' the perturbation of distribution , however if @xmath14 is much bigger , then we could see their difference too .",
    "note also that these ranges can change depending on @xmath14 , with larger values of @xmath14 the test will be more efficient , also there is a chance that they depend on theoretical distribution @xmath9 of sequence @xmath15 .",
    "this can be solved with consideration of @xmath37 for the sequence with a uniform distribution .",
    "we studied datasets of various statistical properties to reveal the role of perturbations in the cosmic microwave background , first of all due to the galactic disk .",
    "we model different sequences of perturbed gaussian distribution to obtain the behavior of the kolmogorov s stochasticity parameter .",
    "this revealed the differences in the k - maps for cmb w and v bands of wmap 5-year data , which are differently influenced by the contribution of the galactic disk .",
    "particularly , the galactic radiation possess high value of @xmath12 and @xmath38 around 1 , which shows its non - gaussian nature , while cmb signal is basically gaussian with inhomogeneous perturbations of various degree of randomness ."
