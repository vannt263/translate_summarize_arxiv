    "landau - zener ( lz ) formula for transition probabilities at avoided crossing of two levels is one of a few fundamental results of non - stationary quantum mechanics .",
    "its rather general character and simplicity makes it extremely suitable for versatile applications .",
    "traditionally it was applied in quantum chemistry @xcite and in collision theory @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a recent treatment of the experiments on the quantum molecular hysteresis in nanomagnets by wernsdorfer and sessoli was a real triumph of the lz theory .",
    "a substantial contributions to the theory of spin tunnelling in these molecules was made by theorists .",
    "landau - zener formula and its generalizations were recently employed also for charge transport in nanostructures , bose - einstein condensates @xcite and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "extensions of the lz theory to the case of multilevel crossing are less general . nevertheless , some of them were realistic enough to justify remarkable efforts on the side of theorists for their analysis .",
    "level correlations and localization in energy space were studied in @xcite .",
    "the pioneering work by demkov and osherov @xcite treated exactly the crossing of a single level with a band of parallel levels . in the work @xcite hioe and",
    "carrol solved a problem of transitions in a zeeman multiplet of an arbitrary spin s in a magnetic field with a constant perpendicular component and a time - dependent parallel component passing through zero value .",
    "numerous generalizations of these results were found .",
    "a general point of view on all these exactly solvable models proposed by one of authors @xcite allowed to construct an algorithm for series of new solvable models .",
    "another extensions include nonlinear lz - model and lz problem with nonlinear sweep @xcite .",
    "to apply the lz formula and its multi - state extensions to real systems it is often necessary to take into account the interaction with environment .",
    "such attempts were made in a series of works , however the problem was not solved completely .",
    "et al . _ have obtained an elegant analytic result for the diagonal white noise .",
    "the non - diagonal colored noise was considered by kayanuma @xcite for the two - level crossing without a constant coupling term .",
    "he has found the transition probability in the limit of infinitely short noise correlation time .",
    "his result was disputed by nishino _",
    "_ @xcite . on the basis of their numerical calculations",
    "these authors concluded that the transitions due to non - diagonal noise are weak in many realistic situations .",
    "the discrepancy is associated with different limiting procedures in calculations . in the limit of infinitely short correlations but finite amplitude of sweeping field",
    "the transition probability was found to be vanishingly small .",
    "the influence of the noise onto the multilevel crossing was studied so far in only one work by saito and kayanuma @xcite , who considered the 3-level crossing at a special relations between parameters in the limit of strong decoherence .",
    "the purpose of this article is to present a systematic study of the influence of noise , including the colored noise , onto the lz transitions and to generalize it to multistate lz problems .",
    "we demonstrate that the lz transitions are sensitive to the colored noise much weaker than usual @xmath0-like white noise .",
    "the latter can be considered as a limit of a noise whose correlation time goes to zero and simultaneously its square of amplitude goes to infinity , so that their product remains a constant .",
    "we prove that such a white non - diagonal noise always leads to equal population of the crossing levels .",
    "however , the noise , whose correlation time goes to zero , but its amplitude remains a constant , produces non - trivial transition probabilities as it was first found by kayanuma @xcite for a special type of the noise correlation function .",
    "another subtle problem is the order of limiting processes @xcite .",
    "the resulting probabilities depend crucially on what happens first : time asymptotically goes to infinity or correlation time goes to zero .",
    "analysis of these problems allowed us to reconcile works @xcite and @xcite . in our work",
    "we first find simple analytical result for a transition produced by a most general short - time correlated noise in 2-level systems and the change of the lz probabilities produced by such a noise .",
    "we check these analytical results by numerical calculations .",
    "we also study the influence of the noise on transitions at multilevel crossing .    the plan of the article is as follows . in section",
    "ii we generalize the result of kayanuma for transverse noise @xcite to the case of the arbitrary gaussian noise in all three directions .",
    "next we demonstrate its generalization to a three level system . in the section",
    "iv we study the time dependence of the density matrix with lz transitions stimulated by fast noise . in the fifth section",
    "we propose a formula that incorporates constant transverse magnetic field and compare its predictions with numerical simulations . in section",
    "vi we consider the master equation for an arbitrary spin placed into a regular varying field and noisy magnetic field along the @xmath1-direction and a constant field along @xmath2-direction and find simple expressions for transition probabilities in the limit of a strong decoherence . in section vii",
    "we perform similar calculations for a charged particle on a periodic chain driven by a time - dependent electric field and compare our results with those for a completely coherent evolution .",
    "lz transitions in a two - level system with a non - diagonal noise were studied by kayanuma in @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the problem was chosen to be @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the noise field with the correlation function @xmath5 and @xmath6 are pauli matrices . in the limit of infinitely short correlation time @xmath7 kayanuma",
    "has found a simple analytical result for the transition probability .",
    "the choice of kayanuma corresponds to the spin @xmath8 problem with noisy magnetic field along the @xmath2-axes only .",
    "we generalize the kayanuma model introducing a more general hamiltonian with all 3 components of random magnetic field being non - zero and with a most general form of the short - time correlation tensor : @xmath9 @xmath10 we assume that though @xmath11 can be different for different @xmath12 , they are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we consider the limit of fast noise with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the inverse characteristic decay time of the correlator @xmath11 .",
    "the density matrix elements for the system with the hamiltonian ( [ hk ] ) obey the following system of ordinary differential equations :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 . by elimination of non - diagonal matrix elements equations ( [ dm5 ] )",
    "are transformed into one integral - differential equation for the occupation difference @xmath17 : @xmath18    the solution of this equation can be formally found as an infinite series in powers of @xmath19 that must be averaged over noise realizations .",
    "a typical term contains the product @xmath20 .",
    "its average is equal to the sum of all possible products of pair correlators since we assume the noise to be gaussian .",
    "kayanuma @xcite has shown that in the limit of very fast noise only the term in which the pairing is ideally ordered in time , i.e. the pairs are ( 12)(34) ... (2n-1,2n ) , contributes a finite value into the integral .",
    "other pairings contribute terms , which are by a power of infinitely small parameter @xmath21 smaller and can be neglected .",
    "this kayanuma s observation is completely analogues to the theorem proven by abrikosov and gorkov in their theory of impurities in a metal @xcite . note that the diagonal component of noise is inessential in this approximation and can be omitted .",
    "these facts allow to write down the integral - differential equation for the average value of @xmath17 as follows : @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "now we can employ the approximation of the fast noise assuming that the average @xmath24 almost does not change in the interval of time @xmath21 and that integral of correlation function is convergent .",
    "in this approximation we can extract @xmath24 from the integral in the right - hand side of equation ( [ int - diff ] ) and expand the argument of the cosine near the end point @xmath25 of the integral .",
    "the resulting differential equation reads : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the cosine fourier transform of the function @xmath28 : @xmath29 note that the characteristic value of @xmath30 are of the order @xmath14 and , respectively , essential values of @xmath31 in equation ( [ diff ] ) are @xmath32 .",
    "we see that essential values of time go to infinity together with @xmath14 .",
    "it shows that the order of limiting processes is indeed very important .",
    "here we first calculate the transition probability , i.e. the diagonal elements of the density matrix at @xmath33 and at very large , but still finite @xmath14 and put it infinity in the end . solving equation ( [ diff ] ) ,",
    "we find : @xmath34 together with the standard equation @xmath35 equation ( [ exp ] ) determines average occupation number of each level at any time .",
    "the most interesting are the transition probabilities at @xmath36 , which can be obtained from the same equation ( [ exp ] ) .",
    "note that the integral in the exponent at @xmath36 becomes equal to @xmath37 thus , from equations ( [ exp ] ) and ( [ infty ] ) we find : @xmath38;\\label{11 } \\\\",
    "\\rho_{22}(+\\infty)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[1-\\left(2\\rho_{11 } ( -\\infty)-1\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi f(0)}{\\beta}\\right)\\right ] \\label{22}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] putting @xmath39 , we find the transition probability : @xmath40 \\label{probability}\\ ] ] for the standard white noise the correlators @xmath41 turn into delta - functions in the limit @xmath42 .",
    "it means that their values at @xmath43 become infinitely large .",
    "in particular it means that @xmath44 is infinitely large for the standard white noise . in this case , as it is seen from equations ( [ 11 ] ) , ( [ 22 ] ) the occupancies of both levels are equal to 1/2 .",
    "thus , the standard white noise leads to complete loss of initial state memory and equipartition of the levels .",
    "on the other hand , if the amplitude of noise remains finite , the occupation numbers conserve memory on the initial state .    in the limit of the fast noise",
    "the transition probabilities are determined only by the average square of non - diagonal noise and are not sensitive to the diagonal noise . to illustrate this statement we consider a special case when the diagonal noise does not correlate with the non - diagonal one .",
    "then , as it is seen from equation ( [ ie1 ] ) , the averaging over the @xmath1-component of the noise leads to multiplication of the coefficients in this integral - differential equation by the debye - waller factor @xmath45 @xmath46 an essential interval of integration over @xmath47 near @xmath25 is @xmath21 . in this interval",
    "the debye - waller factor changes by the value @xmath48 and with this precision is equal to 1 .    for a special case @xmath49",
    "we reproduce the kayanuma s result @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath50 of a general multi - state lz problem ( see for example @xcite ) has the following matrix form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a diagonal matrix and matrices @xmath53 and @xmath52 are independent on time .",
    "however , in a situation of a general position only two levels cross .",
    "several levels can intersect at the same moment of time only due to a special symmetry .",
    "such a symmetry is systematically realized in the model of an arbitrary spin @xmath54 placed into an external magnetic field that has a time - dependent @xmath1-component vanishing at some moment of time @xmath55 and a constant transverse component @xcite .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are constants .",
    "this exactly solvable model for a spin higher than @xmath8 was employed in the theory of stark effect @xcite ; some recent applications can be found in .    in this section",
    "we generalize the result ( [ probability ] ) to a spin 1 system .",
    "we consider a following hamiltonian for the spin 1 system in a random magnetic field : @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the spin projection operators for @xmath61 .",
    "the density matrix @xmath17 depends on 8 independent parameters .",
    "we denote @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the derivation of equations for @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be done in the same spirit as it was done for the spin @xmath8 case .",
    "looking for a solution of the evolution equation for density matrix in the form of perturbation series and retaining after the averaging over the noise only the leading terms in @xmath21 , we arrive at an integral - differential equation .",
    "additional care must be paid to the integrals of the form @xmath66 that did not appear in the two level system , but appeared in the series for the spin @xmath61 .",
    "one can check that this integral is of the order @xmath21 and hence we disregard it and all terms that contain it .",
    "after lengthy but straightforward calculations we find that in the leading order in @xmath21 the elements @xmath67 and @xmath68 satisfy the following integral - differential equation : @xmath69 the approximation of the fast noise allows to transform this equation into the following differential one : @xmath70 thus , the problem is reduced to a linear differential equation with a constant matrix coefficient .",
    "the formal answer is : @xmath71 \\left (   \\begin{array}{l }    \\rho _ + ( -\\infty)\\\\    \\rho _ - ( -\\infty ) \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] this formal solution can be transformed to a more explicit form with the help of the matrix identity : @xmath72= e^{-\\gamma }   \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc }    \\cosh \\gamma /2 & -\\sinh\\gamma",

    "the transition probabilities are : @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "we see that in the case of 3 levels the main results obtained in the previous section for a 2-level system persist : the standard white ( @xmath79 ) noise leads to equal population of all 3 levels , whereas the fast noise with a finite amplitude results in non - trivial transition probabilities .",
    "in section 2 we have shown that the typical time for establishing the asymptotic of the transition probabilities is @xmath80 .",
    "it is useful to look at the same problem from a different point of view .",
    "namely , we will analyze the behavior of transitions driven by the standard @xmath0-like white noise , their typical rates and times .",
    "if the action of the standard white noise is limited by some finite time interval , it becomes physically equivalent to the fast noise with a finite amplitude .",
    "simultaneously we will study directly the influence of the white noise onto the lz transitions .",
    "let us consider the problem with the very beginning .",
    "the hamiltonian is the generator of a random rotation : @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",

    "dynamic equation for the 2-nd order symmetric tensor @xmath93 reads : @xmath94 the extension for the rest of irreducible components is obvious . in equation ( [ vector ] ) for the vectorial part it is useful to apply the interaction representation : @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the evolution matrix for the field @xmath97 .",
    "the reduced vector @xmath98 obeys the following equation:@xmath99 here @xmath100 . in terms of the cartesian",
    "coordinates this equation reads : @xmath101 where the matrix @xmath102 is : @xmath103 initial values of @xmath104 and @xmath105 coincide since @xmath106 .",
    "equation ( [ components ] ) can be solved by power expansion over the noise : @xmath107 when averaging the expansion over the noise , all odd terms vanish . to understand what happens with even terms consider first the quadratic term :",
    "@xmath108    for the isotropic noise the contribution to the vector @xmath109 up to the second order in @xmath110 can be represented as follows ( we write equations for averages omitting the angular brackets ) : @xmath111 where @xmath112    here we have used properties of the orthogonal matrices @xmath113 : @xmath114 .",
    "next we proceed to the quartic term : @xmath115 quartic average of gaussian field decays into quadratic averages : @xmath116 only the first term contributes to the integral ( [ quartic ] ) .",
    "two others are zero at correct time ordering @xmath117 . in both cases considered earlier",
    "we obtain : @xmath118 the same result could be obtained from an effective equation of motion for @xmath119 : @xmath120 thus , the operator @xmath121 plays the role of effective non - hermitian hamiltonian .    for the white isotropic noise the solution of the equation ( [ effective ] )",
    "is : @xmath122 at @xmath123 the formula ( [ win ] ) always leads to the occupation numbers @xmath124 . as we know",
    ", this does not happen for the colored noise with a finite amplitude .",
    "the reason is that in the genuine lz problem the solution strongly oscillates with the frequency roughly @xmath125 long before and after the level crossing point .",
    "this introduces a new energy scale that must be compared with @xmath14 . for time in the range @xmath126 ,",
    "the approximation of white noise is roughly valid even for finite amplitude noise , but beyond this interval of time the oscillations of the lz solution become faster than the correlation time of the noise , and the action of the noise is suppressed by the oscillations .    in @xmath127",
    "we demonstrate a typical evolution of the probability for the system to stay in the same state as a function of time .",
    "the evolution reminds diffusive motion that slowly stops at large absolute values of time .",
    "the sharp change of the absolute value of the amplitude near @xmath55 is due to the constant transverse field .    , where @xmath128 is the amplitude of the first diabatic state .",
    "the choice of parameters is as follows , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 . ]    to estimate roughly the transition probability one can apply the standard white noise approximation in the time interval @xmath134 and accept that at @xmath135 no transitions due to the noise happen .",
    "the parameter @xmath136 is a constant of the order of unity .",
    "then we automatically get the result @xmath137 .",
    "according to the definition , @xmath138 in agreement with the calculations of the previous sections .",
    "summarizing , the transitions mediated by the fast noise proceed during the large time interval of the order of @xmath139 .",
    "this is the reason why its total effect remains finite , though it is very small on a typical time scale of the usual lz - transitions mediated by constant field ( @xmath140 ) @xcite .",
    "in previous sections we assumed that only the noise was responsible for transitions , whereas the regular part of the hamiltonian operator was diagonal . in this section we incorporate a regular non - diagonal operator ( the transverse field ) into the hamiltonian together with a noise .",
    "the most general hamiltonian for such a two - level system reads : @xmath141 where @xmath142 are coordinates of the vectorial gaussian noise with correlators given by ( [ correlator ] ) .    the second term in the hamiltonian ( [ hig ] )",
    "can be considered as a constant transverse magnetic field acting on a spin @xmath143 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hig ] ) describes a spin ( q - bit ) weakly interacting with the environment , for example with the nuclear spin bath @xcite .",
    "if this interaction is so small that the bath relaxation is much faster than the inverse interaction energy , the bath can be treated as a fast noisy magnetic field .",
    "the measurements of the lz transition probabilities can provide an information about the strength of the coupling to the bath .",
    "another possible example is a molecular nanomagnet in fluctuating dipole field .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hig ] ) may be relevant to the quantum shuttle problem where avoided level crossings occurred to be important @xcite .",
    "the fast noise in this example corresponds to thermal fluctuations .    as it was discussed in the previous section , in the interval of time @xmath144 the spin experiences an equivalent white noise with the amplitude @xmath145 vanishing at @xmath13 .",
    "the noise causes a slow decay of the population difference @xmath146 .",
    "the action of the noise becomes noticeable only after long evolution time of the order @xmath147 . on the contrary ,",
    "the transitions due to the constant transverse field proceed predominantly during a much shorter interval of time @xmath148 . during this interval of time",
    "the role of noise is negligible comparing with the role of the constant transverse field .",
    "let us choose @xmath149 much less than @xmath147 , but much larger than @xmath150 to make sure that the transverse magnetic field is neglegible beyond the interval of time @xmath151 .",
    "the evolution from @xmath152 to @xmath153 is influenced mainly by the noise .",
    "the result of such an evolution is almost the same as that in the absence of the constant transverse field with @xmath154 .",
    "since the effective attenuation coefficient for @xmath17 is an even function of time ( see equation ( [ diff ] ) ) , the resulting exponent for @xmath155 is twice less than that for the problem of the section ( 2 ) at @xmath36 ( equations ( [ exp],[infty ] ) : @xmath156    in the interval of time @xmath157 the noise is neglegible and transitions are completely due to the genuine landau - zener mechanism , i.e. due to the constant transverse field @xmath58 . since @xmath158 , we can use the lz formula to determine @xmath159 .",

    "an important assumption in the model that makes it exactly solvable is that all sites of the chain are identical and equidistant .",
    "external electric field splits the energy levels at different sites of the chain and suppresses the tunnelling between them .",
    "hence the transitions proceed in a narrow time intervals close to moments at which the electric field becomes zero .",
    "the noise in such a system arises due to thermal fluctuations chaotically changing the energy of the electron .",
    "we suppose that there are no correlations of noise at different sites .",
    "let us denote @xmath226 a state located at the @xmath227-th site of the chain .",
    "we assume that these states form a complete orthonormal set ( wannier basis ) . in terms of this set the electron hamiltonian with linear dependence of an external field on time",
    "reads :    @xmath228    where @xmath229 and @xmath58 are constants and we assume that the noise power is the same for all sites i.e. @xmath230 . the derivation of the master equation for this case is similar to that of the previous section .",
    "we consider only the limit of strong noise @xmath231 .",
    "then , as in previous example , the non - diagonal elements of the density matrix @xmath232 with @xmath233 can be neglected .",
    "equations for diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix are : @xmath234 equations for non - diagonal elements after the averaging over the random noise read : @xmath235 neglecting again time derivatives in these equations , we find : @xmath236 substituting ( [ nd3 ] ) into the equations ( [ dm1 ] ) for diagonal elements , we obtain the evolution equations for diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix @xmath237 : @xmath238 without loss of generality we can assume that initially , at @xmath239 , the particle was located at the site number zero .",
    "it can be treated as initial conditions for the master equation : @xmath240 and all other elements of the density matrix are zeros at @xmath241 . then diagonal matrix elements @xmath237 acquire the meaning of transition probabilities from zeroth to the @xmath227-th site at a current time @xmath31 . as in the previous example we can find the solution for a chain of arbitrary number of sites in the matrix form .    in the limit of infinite number of sites",
    "a compact solution can be found by employing the fourier - transformation @xmath242 .",
    "the system of coupled differential equations ( [ ch1 ] ) is diagonalized by this transformation .",
    "corresponding differential equation of the first order for the function @xmath243 is readily solved .",
    "its solution with the initial condition @xmath244 is @xmath245 \\nonumber\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath246 it approaches its limiting value : @xmath247 by the inverse fourier - transformation we find the diagonal elements of the density matrix : @xmath248 here @xmath249 is the transition probability from the site with the index @xmath250 to the cite with the index @xmath227 .",
    "it is interesting to compare results of this calculation which incorporates a strong noise with the transition probabilities without noise . in the absence of the noise",
    "@xmath251 the transition probabilities are @xcite :    @xmath252        @xmath253 shows a typical behavior of the transition probabilities for both cases .",
    "the difference in the behavior is clearly pronounced . in the absence of the noise",
    "the transition probabilities oscillate as functions of @xmath227 and @xmath58 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "these oscillations arise due to the interference among the amplitudes of different feynman paths leading from the initial to the final point . in the case of a strong noise",
    "these oscillation are suppressed by the noise imposed decoherence and the probability distribution is a smooth bell - like curve .",
    "a simple parameter that is related to the effective diffusion coefficient and can be measured experimentally is the average square displacement of the particle during one sweep of the external field . for a chain with a strong noise",
    "it is : @xmath254 despite a strong difference in the distribution functions , the average square displacement ( [ ch6 ] ) coincides with that for the coherent evolution without noise .",
    "in conclusion , we have derived the formula for the transition probabilities at the non - adiabatic crossing of two levels coupled by a fast non - diagonal random field in the landau - zener approximation .",
    "depending on the strength of parameters it interpolates between the landau - zener formula for noiseless system and the kayanuma s result for transitions mediated by the transverse noise only .",
    "we have determined the time intervals during which transitions are substantial and showed that time of transitions mediated by the constant field is much shorter than the time necessary for transition caused by the fast noise .",
    "our numerical simulations are in a good agreement with the analytical formulas .",
    "we have discovered an important property of the non - adiabatic tunnelling process : its probability depends not on the `` power '' of the noise @xmath255 but rather on the coupling to the noise @xmath256 .",
    "the former usually is responsible for the decoherence rate in systems without time- dependent fields .",
    "measurements of the lz transition probability can provide the information about the value of this coupling .",
    "the multi - level systems placed in regular time - dependent fields feel subtle differences of the noise statistical properties .",
    "we assumed that the diagonal noise does not dominate .",
    "in this situation it does not play any role .",
    "however , if the component of the diagonal noise is much stronger than non - diagonal ones , the situation may change drastically .",
    "the problem of strong transverse field compatible with noise inverse correlation time also remains open .",
    "we have extended the formulas and methods employed for two - level systems to a couple of multi - state lz systems : an arbitrary spin experiencing the time - dependent regular and random magnetic field and a linear chain of sites in the external time - dependent homogeneous electric field plus noise .",
    "the landau - zener transitions for spins higher than @xmath8 were observed in a number of systems .",
    "therefore we believe that our solutions can be checked experimentally .",
