    "ising lattice models are realized in a variety of materials with magnetic interactions , for instance in rare earth compounds where the outer electron in the lanthanide ion acts as an ising spin interacting with its neighbors .",
    "depending on the lattice structure ( frustrated or unfrustrated ) , dimensionality ( one to three ) , and interaction type ( ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic ) , the properties and phases in the system display a wide range of possibilities @xcite .",
    "coupling of the ising spins to an external field can further introduce interesting behavior such as the presence of a magnetization plateau .",
    "many such characteristics of the system may be captured by the model s partition function ; accurate determination of the partition function poses a numerical challenge if there are competing interactions within the system , which is often the case for antiferromagnetic interactions on non - bipartite lattices .",
    "these competing interactions can result in large degeneracies in phase space .",
    "+ indeed , antiferromagnetic ising models can harbor a macroscopic number of degenerate ground states at zero external field on frustrated lattices like the triangular lattice @xcite , kagome lattice @xcite , pyrochlore @xcite lattice , to name a few .",
    "an extensive entropy may survive , albeit with different values , even for infinitesimal fields @xcite on certain lattices ; as the field is varied , a strongly enhanced peak in the entropy develops just before the field - induced spin - ordering sets in @xcite ; this substantial peak occurs because , at this field strength , a large number of non - neighboring spins may be flipped against the field without a cost in energy @xcite .",
    "in fact , such residual saturation entropies @xmath3 persist in quantum spin models ( anisotropic heisenberg models ) , although with different values from the ising limits , and for different reasons @xcite pertaining to the existence of localized magnons .",
    "+ in section [ sec : ladders ] , residual saturation entropies of related ising quasi one - dimensional lattices or ladders ( fig . [ ladders ] )",
    "are exactly computed .",
    "the statistical properties of the ladders are considered primarily to establish the results on the kagome lattice ; @xmath4 will be used to construct the square lattice to compare with earlier results before we employ ladder @xmath5 to build up the kagome lattice .",
    "the bounds on the kagome lattice saturation entropy will be justified via the construction of ladder @xmath6 from @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , ladders with these geometries are realized in a range of materials @xcite .",
    "the two - leg ladder @xmath4 with magnetic interactions are realized in compounds such as vanadyl pyrophosphate @xmath7 and the cuprate @xmath8 @xcite ; ladder @xmath6 , which is equivalent to the axial - next - nearest - neighbor ising ( anni ) model , describes phase transitions in the charge - lattice - spin coupled system @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "and ladder @xmath5 bears resemblance in geometric structure and interaction to the ising - heisenberg polymer chain @xmath10}_{\\infty}$ ] @xcite .",
    "+ in sections [ sec : kagome ] and [ sec : binders ] , we consider the ising kagome lattice , shown in fig .",

    "may be deduced from calculations for spin ice on the pyrochlore lattice in a [ 111 ] field @xcite ; results of monte carlo simulations , series expansion techniques @xcite and the bethe approximation were found to be comparable @xcite for the saturation entropy . in section [ sec : kagome ] , we elucidate a procedure for obtaining a more accurate estimate of this value through ( a ) transfer matrix methods , and equivalently ( b ) the solution of appropriate difference equations that generate the partition function . finally in section [",
    "sec : binders ] , we provide a considerably improved estimate of @xmath3 for the kagome lattice using binder s algorithm . with which we may exactly calculate the partition function of a system of over , in our case , 1300 ising spins at the saturation field with the expenditure of modest computational resources .",
    "we point out that it is only for the ising kagome lattice , among other two dimensional lattices , that the zero field entropy exceeds the saturation field entropy .",
    "+ the antiferromagnetic ising models we investigate are described by the hamiltonian @xmath11 on an @xmath12 site lattice with @xmath13 , the nearest number of neighbors .",
    "this is the saturation field beyond which ordering sets in . the variables @xmath14 which we represent by down and up spins , and the interaction between nearest neighbors is denoted by the angular brackets , setting the energy scale of the problem .",
    "the boundary conditions are chosen to be either free or periodic .",
    "although the number of allowed states for a given finite system will differ depending on the boundary conditions , the dominant multiplicative degeneracy of the system as @xmath15 will reflect the bulk property .",
    "it will then be a question of computational convenience whether free or periodic boundary conditions be chosen .    [",
    "cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have seen in the preceding section that free boundary conditions along with provide a rapidly convergent sequence for the entropy .",
    "the main limitation was however the calculation of @xmath16 for large @xmath17 values .",
    "this may be achieved by employing binder s algorithm towards an exact evaluation of the partition function of finite lattice systems @xcite .",
    "to briefly recapitulate , the partition function of a system of size @xmath18 is expressed in terms of the degeneracies @xmath19 of the @xmath20 ladder in its @xmath21 state . then",
    "clearly @xmath22 now the degeneracies of an added ladder for the @xmath23 system may be recursively computed by @xmath24 with the summation running over only those values of @xmath25 such that state @xmath26 may be adjacent to it . with this ,",
    "we have computed the partition function of over 1300 spins with modest computational effort .",
    "for instance , we are able to reproduce up to 10 digits in the residual saturation field entropy value for the square lattice@xcite using twenty 10-rung @xmath4 ladders . + using - we compute @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 to give six stable digits for the kagome lattice saturation field entropy @xmath30 we compare this with low temperature monte carlo simulation results and the bethe approximation for pyrochlore spin ice which",
    ", at the saturation field , may be described by a two - dimensional network of ising pseudo - spin kagome lattice @xcite . scaling the saturation field results of isakov et al . by a factor of 4/3 ( because the corner spin in the pyrochlore tetrahedron is considered frozen giving a high temperature entropy per site of only @xmath31 ) , we obtain the relevant results to be @xmath32 this value is to be compared with the experimentally observed peak in the pyrochlore compound dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 close to the high - field termination of the plateau @xcite where the physics was argued to be governed by decoupled kagome planes @xcite .",
    "we point out , along with the authors of ref .",
    "[ 7 ] , that the computed values ( in and ) are slightly higher than the magnitude of the experimentally measured peak . for the spin ice compound at saturation ,",
    "the corresponding value of approximately @xmath33 joules / deg./mole ( obtained by multiplying by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the gas constant ) may be compared with the first prominent experimental peak in the saturation entropy at @xmath36 of about @xmath37 joules / deg./mole @xcite .",
    "the difference between the two values suggests that either more precise measurements with error bars are required on this compound close to the transition field , or that the applicability of the ising model on decoupled kagome planes close to this spin - ice material s saturation field might need to be slightly reconsidered .",
    "we have considered the degenerate space of states of a few ising ladders and the ising kagome lattice at the saturation external field . for the ladders , by a simple redefinition of a site , the residual entropy may be exactly computed .",
    "we treat the generation of states for periodic and free boundary conditions on a general footing by use of difference equations .",
    "+ for the kagome lattice , we are able to provide six stable digits for the residual entropy by calculating the exact partition function of over 1300 spins using binder s algorithm implemented on a standard computer .",
    "our accurate result compares reasonably with approximate results from low temperature monte carlo simulations and the bethe approximation for an equivalent system .",
    "we believe that by constructing appropriate ladders the residual saturation field entropies of geometrically complex lattices , like the pyrochlore , may be similarly computed with more ease after their transformation to standard lattice structures .",
    "comments on the relation to the experimental situation on the spin - ice compound dy@xmath1ti@xmath1o@xmath2 were made .",
