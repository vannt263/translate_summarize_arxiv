    "we consider bosonic atoms of mass @xmath19 with two internal states , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , at energies @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "these atoms are exposed to laser fields of frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and wavevectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 which induce raman transitions between the two internal states ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : scheme]a , b ) .",
    "thus , a raman process from state @xmath20 to @xmath21 imparts a momentum of @xmath29 and kinetic energy of @xmath30 .",
    "the continuous raman coupling can be regarded as a spatially - periodic coupling field between the internal states of the atoms , represented by an off - diagonal potential @xmath31 to describe single - atom states in the @xmath32 basis , we transform to a frame which is _ co - rotating _ and _ co - moving _ with the driving laser fields , yielding a spinor wavefunction @xmath33 with components @xmath34 .",
    "this transformation yields a schrodinger equation with two debroglie wave solutions at each momentum @xmath35 , which we call the the periodically - dressed states .",
    "the two - branch dispersion relation of the periodically - dressed atoms has the form ( using @xmath36 for plus and @xmath37 for minus ) @xmath38 where energies and wavevectors are scaled by the raman recoil energy @xmath39 and wavevector @xmath40 , respectively .    under the conditions of exact raman resonance ( @xmath41 ) and sufficiently small rabi frequency @xmath42 , a degeneracy of momentum ground states occurs as the lower dispersion relation takes the form of a double - well potential , with minima at @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) ( fig.[fig : scheme]c ) .",
    "this potential can be quickly tuned by modifying the laser based parameters .",
    "the detuning from raman resonance @xmath45 breaks the ground - state degeneracy , favoring the right- or left - well states .",
    "the spacing between the potential wells is controlled by the raman momentum transfer @xmath46 , which can be varied by reorienting the laser beams . finally , the rabi frequency @xmath47 changes both the height of the barrier between the wells , as well as the internal - state character of states on either side of the well @xcite .    in the case of a position - space",
    "double well , the kinetic energy of the atoms forbids a complete localization of atoms in either of the wells , thus introducing tunnelling .",
    "similarly , in our case of the momentum - space double - well , a tunnelling between well - defined momentum states can be induced by adding a spatially - dependent term to the hamiltonian .",
    "we consider adding an internal - state independent position - space trapping potential of the form @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system may be written in the basis of the periodically - dressed states introduced earlier , using the expansion @xmath49 where @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a pauli matrix and the mixing angle @xmath52 is defined by the relation @xmath53 .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath54 in the space of periodically - dressed momentum eigenstates obeys a schrdinger equation with hamiltonian @xmath55 the position - space trapping potential is seen in momentum space as a kinetic - energy - like term ( involving @xmath56 ) , which accounts also for the variations with @xmath57 of the periodically - dressed eigenstate basis .",
    "the relevance of this kinetic - energy - like term is measured by the dimensionless effective mass parameter @xmath58 , which is related to the lamb - dicke parameter @xmath59 as @xmath60 . for weak spatial confinement ( @xmath61 ) ,",
    "the low - energy single - particle states are restricted primarily to the lower periodically - dressed states , with the two lowest states split by a small tunnelling energy @xmath2 . for strong confinement ( @xmath62 ) , the single - particle states are admixtures of upper- and lower - dispersion - relation periodically - dressed states , and a simple double - well treatment is no longer adequate .    to introduce interatomic interactions , we make use of the field operator @xmath63 the components of which annihilate particles in the lower ( @xmath64 ) or upper ( @xmath36 ) periodically - dressed states .",
    "these operators obey bose commutation relations .",
    "we consider low - energy , binary , elastic collisions with a state - independent scattering length @xmath65 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian then takes the form @xmath66 , neglecting terms dependent only on the total number of atoms @xmath11 , where @xmath67 is the spatial fourier transform of the density operator , and @xmath68 is the properly scaled interaction parameter . the density operator is given as @xcite @xmath69",
    "to simplify our treatment , let us consider only the situation in which the two lowest energy eigenvalues ( in the absence of interactions ) are well separated from the remaining energies , and thus a two - mode description of the many - body system is adequate .",
    "the two lowest - energy single - particle states have wavefunctions @xmath70 and @xmath71 , mode operators @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and energy splitting @xmath2 .",
    "we define the right- and left - well states as @xmath74 , and the mode operators as @xmath75 . under this approximation",
    ", we can evaluate the density operator @xmath67 by expanding the field operators @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the basis of energy eigenstates , and then truncating the expansion after the first two states .",
    "we then express the density operator as @xmath78 with @xmath79 with indices @xmath80 denoting either the right or left states .",
    "accounting for properties of the right- and left - well states under parity @xcite , we obtain @xmath81 where @xmath11 is the total number of atoms in the system .",
    "dropping terms that depend only on @xmath11 , one thus finds @xmath82 where the energies @xmath10 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are given as @xmath85    before delving further into the implications of the interaction hamiltonian given above , let us consider the weak confinement ( large @xmath58 ) limit at which the right- and left - well states contain no population in the upper ( @xmath36 ) dressed states , are gaussian functions well - localized ( in @xmath57 space ) at the right and left potential minima at @xmath86 , with rms widths @xmath87 , and have average density per particle @xmath88 . in calculating the integrals of eq .",
    "[ eq : nfunctions ] , we may thus use local values of the rotation matrices @xmath89 at @xmath86 , as appropriate .",
    "we then find @xmath90 these approximations can be further simplified by setting @xmath91 , and thus @xmath92 .",
    "let us presume that the interaction - mediated tunnelling terms @xmath83 and @xmath84 are negligibly small .",
    "we thus recover the many - body hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ eq : position_double_well ] which had applied to the _ position - space double well_. however , examining the interaction energy @xmath10 , we now find that _ the roles of attractive and repulsive interactions are interchanged _ between the position - space and momentum - space double well treatments : for the case of the momentum - space double - well potential , repulsive interactions ( @xmath93 ) yield @xmath16 and thus are the source of schrdinger - cat ground states , while attractive interactions ( @xmath94 ) yield @xmath95 and thus are the source of number - squeezed ground states .",
    "this opens the door to the production of schrdinger - cat states for large , robust bose - einstein condensates with repulsive interactions through the use of binary collisions as a non - linear coupling .",
    "this reversal of roles for repulsive and attractive interactions in momentum space can be understood in the context of a single - component bose - einstein condensate in a harmonic potential .",
    "repulsive interactions lead the ground - state condensate wavefunction to become larger spatially , thus causing the momentum - space wavefunction to contract  appearing as an attractive interaction in momentum - space .",
    "equivalently , one may note that in a hartree approximation to the many - body state of a bose - einstein condensate , the interaction energy is evaluated as an interaction energy density proportional to the square of the density .",
    "the density of a bose gas occupying two distinct momentum states would be spatially modulated by the interference between the momentum states , and , therefore , its interaction energy @xmath96 would be increased ( decreased ) for the case of repulsive ( attractive ) interactions .",
    "thus we find repulsive interactions leading to schrdinger - cat states , a superposition of states in which only one single - particle state is macroscopically occupied , while attractive interactions would lead to a `` fractionation '' of the condensate between distinct momentum states .    in the system we have described here , the interaction energy @xmath10 is a _",
    "tunable exchange term _ which , in the case of repulsive interactions , suppresses the superposition of atoms in two distinct momentum states and thereby favors the maximally - entangled state .",
    "the exchange term in the interaction hamiltonian arises from the presence of atoms in identical internal states , but different momentum states . by adjusting the strength of the rabi coupling @xmath47 , the admixture of internal states @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the right and left well states is varied . for small @xmath47 ,",
    "atoms in the right - well state are almost purely in the @xmath20 state , and atoms in the left - well state are almost purely in the @xmath21 state .",
    "thus , the strength of the exchange term is suppressed ( @xmath97 ) , and the product state @xmath98 remains energetically favored . for larger @xmath47 ,",
    "the right and left - well states both contain admixtures of the two internal states ; e.g.  the right - well state contains atoms in state @xmath20 nearly at rest , while the left - well state contains atoms in state @xmath20 at momentum @xmath99 .",
    "significant exchange terms now suppress the product state in favor of the maximally - entangled state .",
    "the dependence of the many - body ground state on the ratio @xmath100 and the atom number @xmath11 has been worked out by various authors @xcite for the position - space double - well potential . as we have obtained a hamiltonian identical in form to the position - space treatment , these predictions would apply directly to our scheme .",
    "significant deviations from the factorized , non - interacting atom solution begin at @xmath101 ; for repulsive ( @xmath95 ) or attractive ( @xmath16 ) interactions this would shift population either away from or towards the state @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "perturbation analysis shows that the many - body state will be well approximated by the schrdinger - cat state @xmath103 when @xmath104 .    now returning to eq .",
    "[ eq : hint_two_mode ] , we see that two extra terms appear in @xmath105 which do not conserve the number of particles in the right- and left - well states , representing a form of interaction - mediated tunnelling .",
    "the first , involving @xmath106 , modifies the tunnelling energy between the right and left wells .",
    "the effect of this term is to reduce the tunnelling rate for repulsive interactions , and increase it for attractive interactions .",
    "this can be understood by noting that repulsive interactions tend to raise the energy of the single - particle ground state more than the first excited state since the ground state has a higher density .",
    "our previous analysis of the two - mode approximation accommodates this term by a redefinition of @xmath2 as @xmath107 , leading to no further complications .",
    "the second tunnelling term , involving @xmath108 , describes collisions which can redistribute two atoms from the right well to the left well , and vice versa .",
    "while this term modifies the conclusions of our simple treatment , we have seen that the magnitudes of both @xmath106 and @xmath108 are exponentially suppressed with respect to @xmath10 , and thus the dominant role of interactions is to create the aforementioned many - body ground states .",
    "these terms will , however , play an important role in determining the strength of interactions at which many - body correlations begin to become evident ; the scaling of @xmath2 ( independent of @xmath109 ) , @xmath106 , @xmath108 and @xmath10 with the control parameters ( @xmath47 , @xmath109 , @xmath58 , etc . ) are different and thereby provide more tunability to the system .",
    "we performed numerical calculations of the lowest - energy single - particle states to verify the simple scaling behaviour of various terms in the hamiltonian described above .",
    "the single - particle hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ eq : singleparticlehami ] is separable in the three cartesian coordinates defined so that one axis ( say @xmath110 ) lies along the direction of the raman momentum transfer @xmath111 .",
    "we then have the lowest energy eigenstates as @xmath112 , a product of harmonic - oscillator ground states in the @xmath113 and @xmath114 directions and normalized solutions @xmath115 to the one - dimensional , two - component schrdinger equation derived from eq.[eq : singleparticlehami ] .",
    "these one - dimensional eigenstates , calculated using a restricted basis set of fourier components over the domain @xmath116 , are shown in figure [ fig : wavefunctions ] for two different values of the mass parameter @xmath58 , and for the condition of exact raman resonance @xmath41 and rabi frequency @xmath117 . for weak spatial confinement ( large @xmath118 ) , the lowest two energy eigenstates",
    "are indeed nearly entirely composed of lower dressed states ( @xmath119 ) and are well - approximated by the sum or difference of gaussian right- and left - well wavefunctions centered at the potential minima near @xmath120 . for stronger spatial confinement ( smaller @xmath121 ) , the enhanced `` momentum - space tunnelling '' causes the wavefunctions to become less confined in the potential minima .",
    "concomitantly , a significant population appears in the upper dressed states .",
    "parameters which enter into the two - mode hamlitonian are derived from the numerically - obtained wavefunctions , and are shown in figure [ fig : tunnel ] .",
    "one finds the scaling @xmath122 as one expects @xcite .",
    "the numerical results confirm the scaling behaviour for @xmath106 found in the weak confinement ( large @xmath58 ) limit ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : startscalings ]  [ eq : endscalings ] ) , but differ slightly from the scaling predicted for @xmath108 since the assumption that the right - well state remains gaussian in the vicinity of the left - well potential minimum is incorrect .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath108 is strongly suppressed for large @xmath58 , approximately as @xmath123 .",
    "also shown is the energy splitting between the second and third lowest eigenenergies ; one sees that for weak spatial confinement the lowest two energy eigenstates become well separated from the remaining eigenspectrum , establishing the validity of the two - mode approximation .",
    "finally , we stress that the two - mode treatment presented here becomes invalid in the thomas - fermi regime , where the strength of atomic interactions dominates the zero - point energy in the confining potential .",
    "in this situation , additional single - particle states must be considered , resulting in a complicated , self - consistent definition of the right- and left - well states which depends on the number of atoms in these states . how to properly treat such a situation remains an open question , and therefore an important subject for experimental investigation .",
    "in related work , montina and arecchi @xcite obtain right- and left - well states through use of the gross - pitaevskii equation , but the validity of their treatment is questionable for systems which are not completely interaction - dominated .",
    "several theoretical works have pointed out the potential for correlated many - body states for improving the precision of atomic clocks @xcite and interferometers @xcite , in which phase shifts are measured at the heisenberg limit @xmath124 , rather than the standard quantum limit @xmath125 , where @xmath11 is the number of particles used in a single run of the experiment .",
    "in particular , bollinger _",
    "et al . _",
    "described the use of the maximally - entangled state in such a measurement @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we point out how dynamical control over experimental parameters can be used fruitfully to generate schrdinger - cat states suited for the implementation of both heisenberg - limited spectroscopy and interferometry .    in the system we have described , repulsive interatomic interactions lead to lowest energy many - body states which are the even- and odd - superposition schrdinger cat states , @xmath126 .",
    "the states @xmath127 and @xmath128 are distinguishable many - body states associated with the right and left potential wells , respectively , which tend toward the limiting cases @xmath129 and @xmath130 for strong interactions .",
    "the energy separation between these two states depends on the residual overlap between @xmath127 and @xmath128 and the number of atoms in the system ( derived , e.g. , in ref.@xcite ) . in the weak - confinement limit @xmath61",
    ", these right- and left - well states are comprised of the lower dressed states , which are superpositions in both internal and external degrees of freedom .",
    "such a superposition appears to complicate the use of these schrodinger - cat states for measurement applications .",
    "however , after these schrodinger - cat states are formed , the dressed right- and left - well states _ can be converted to pure internal or external states adiabatically , _",
    "i.e.  by modification of experimental parameters on a time - scale which is fast with respect to tunnelling times so as to preserve entanglement , but slow with respect to timescales relevant to the raman coupling ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "if the rabi frequency @xmath47 is adiabatically lowered to zero ( the raman beams are slowly extinguished ) , atoms in the right - well state would be adiabatically converted to stationary trapped atoms in the @xmath20 internal state , while atoms in the left well would be converted to stationary trapped atoms in the @xmath21 state .",
    "thus would be prepared a state ideal for heisenberg - limited measurement of the internal state energy difference @xmath132 , potentially on a useful hyperfine clock transition .",
    "alternately , one could adiabatically ramp the detuning from the raman resonance to large positive or negative values .",
    "for example , an adiabatic downward sweep of the frequency difference between the raman laser beams ( @xmath133 ) lowers the energy of the @xmath20 internal state with respect to the @xmath21 internal state in the rotating frame .",
    "this adiabatically converts the right- and left - well states to _ distinguishable momentum states _ with identical internal states ( in this case the @xmath20 state ) .",
    "one thereby prepares a state ideal for heisenberg - limited atomic interferometry .",
    "furthermore , the timed application of raman coupling in this system can be used as a `` magic beamsplitter '' @xcite to prepare the schrdinger - cat state dynamically . for",
    "simplicity let us make the identification @xmath134 state with no raman coupling ( @xmath135 )  this state corresponds to a zero - temperature bose - einstein condensate of @xmath11 atoms in the @xmath21 internal state .",
    "the raman coupling is then turned on adiabatically , as discussed above .",
    "the initial state @xmath136 , being a superposition of the two - lowest energy schrdinger - cat energy eigenstates , is now led to oscillate coherently , and collectively , between the right- and left - well states .",
    "this oscillation is analogous to macroscopic quantum tunnelling observed , for example , in the rabi oscillations of superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "if the raman coupling is left on for a duration which is @xmath137 of the bohr period between the even and odd schrdinger - cat states , the many - body state @xmath136 will evolve as @xmath138 the raman beams can be then switched off  with the transformation of the state into a momentum - space or internal - state - space schrdinger - cat state , as desired  for a duration @xmath139 , during which a relative phase can accrue between the two distinguishable portions of the schrdinger - cat state , i.e.@xmath140 here @xmath141 is the difference in energy between the single - particle states to which the right- and left - well states are connected when the raman beams are extinguished .",
    "for instance , if we are following the implementation of a measurement of the clock frequency between internal states , @xmath142 .",
    "finally , this state must be analyzed . in the scheme of bollinger _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , a conventional @xmath143 pulse is applied , and a precise measurement is made of the difference between the number of atoms in the @xmath20 state and the @xmath21 state  one must establish whether this number difference is even or odd , thus requiring single - atom precision in the number counting .      measurements on this state would detect _ all atoms _ in either the right- or left - well states ( say , internal states @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) , with probabilities which vary periodically with the free - evolution time @xmath139 with frequency @xmath145 which is @xmath11 times higher than for a single - particle ramsey - type measurement .",
    "this is the source of the enhanced heisenberg - level sensitivity .",
    "this sensitivity persists even in the presence of overall number fluctuations , presuming that one s goal is to ascertain whether @xmath146 .",
    "however , the correct timing required to yield a perfect `` magic beamsplitter '' will depend on @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "thus , attaining the highest precision will still require a highly accurate determination of the total atom number @xmath11 , though perhaps not necessarily at the single - atom level .",
    "a further unexamined issue is how the finite temperature of the atomic sample , which prevents the initial state @xmath136 from being a pure bose - einstein condensate , will impact the precision of these schrdinger - cat - based measurements .    in conclusion , we have presented an analytic model which identifies the many - body ground states of a weakly - interacting bose gas which is `` periodically dressed '' by continuous raman excitation and confined in an harmonic spatial potential .",
    "the system is analyzed in momentum space , wherein the balance between tunnelling and weak interactions dictates whether the ground states are uncorrelated product states of single - particle wavefunctions , or highly correlated states .",
    "it is found that interactions in the physical system considered here have the opposite effect as in the dual situation of a position - space double - well potential , that is , repulsive interactions will lead to schrdinger - cat states while attractive interactions will lead to number - squeezed states with equal numbers of atoms in each well .",
    "further , we show that experimental parameters can be used to dynamically tune the interaction strength and tunnelling rates .",
    "this degree of control can be used to generate maximally - entangled states directly suitable for heisenberg - limited metrology and interferometry .",
