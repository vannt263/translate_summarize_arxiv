    "10000 10000 the inflationary paradigm has become an important piece in our understanding of the early universe .",
    "it has been designed and constantly improved since its very first appearance in ref.@xcite wherein it solves the main issues of standard big bang cosmology . in the last three decades",
    ", we witnessed the emergence of a plethora of models , which not only aim to provide expansion for a sufficient number of e - folds , but also expect to produce a power spectrum of fluctuations consistent with the actual structure of the universe .",
    "+ direct computation of the power spectrum from equations of motion can be time consuming , especially when resolving specific features of each model in a wide range of energy scales .",
    "these problems will be aggravated for multifield models of inflation such as the proposals in refs.@xcite .",
    "+ the primordial power spectrum is valuable in finding sensible ranges of validity for the parameters of any proposed inflationary model . in the case of models with multiple fields ,",
    "it encodes vital information about the power transfer between different components",
    ". the viability of a model is usually tested when the spectrum is loaded as an input in any of the existing schemes based in boltzmann transport equations ( such as camb in ref.@xcite or class in ref.@xcite ) and compared with data .",
    "being aware of the existing difficulties to design a spectral code , we suggest an approach intended to isolate all the high frequency terms and only use the slowly evolving quantities relevant for calculating the spectrum .",
    "these degrees of freedom remain `` frozen '' outside the horizon , which implies the use of large time steps in any numerical evolution scheme .",
    "+ a crucial part of separating fast and slow degrees of freedom relies on focusing on the spectrum , which contains information about all the field correlations .",
    "this spectrum is generated by the symmetric product between two field multiplets , forming a correlation matrix .",
    "field dynamics reveals the approximate time - translational invariance of each multiplet component on subhorizon scales .",
    "this symmetry must be exploited to define a well - posed cauchy problem each time vacuum correlations are defined as initial conditions .",
    "when the cases of anticorrelation are excluded , positive definite correlation matrices are suitable for cholesky decomposition into two unique triangular factors .",
    "anticorrelations break the uniqueness of this factorization .",
    "this decomposition has been the preferred tool of statisticians to generate correlated samples from any set of unit variance random vectors .",
    "amplitudes of the modes and power of the cross correlations are carried in these cholesky factors , which act on a rotating basis of solutions , just as in the schrodinger picture in quantum mechanics .",
    "the fast rotation of this basis is separated from the slow evolution of amplitudes .",
    "we implement a dynamical cholesky decomposition motivated by the separation of wave solutions into phases and amplitudes .",
    "this separation has been explored in single field solutions , ( see refs.@xcite for more details ) with exact results in the case of massless perturbations .",
    "+ the plan for this paper is as follows : in section [ sec : review ] , we will review the notions of perturbation theory for inflationary models , along with the equations of motion for the background fields . in section [ sec : correlators ] , we describe the field decomposition technique used in order to separate the fast oscillating phases from the amplitudes .",
    "the latter are required to calculate the spectrum . in section [ sec :",
    "initial ] , we discuss the background dynamics and the use of initial conditions based on asymptotic vacuum solutions . additionally , we introduce a scheme for injecting modes in the system . to conclude , we present our results and discussions .",
    "10000 for the purposes of this work , we only consider lagrangian densities with canonical kinetic terms .",
    "we will later extend our treatment in appendix [ app : appendixa ] for the case of a generic curved field space developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the action @xmath0 needed to describe a generic model of inflation with multiple fields coupled reads , s = d^4x(r-__a^_a - v(_a)),[action ] where all the fields become coordinates of a generically non - flat field space .",
    "we pick spatially flat coordinates just as described in ref.@xcite ds^2=-(1 + 2a)dt^2 - 2a^2_ib dx^i dt+a^2_ijdx^idx^j , [ spflat ] with the @xmath1 signature . now , as is usual in this perturbative approach , we decompose each component of the @xmath2 field multiplet @xmath3 into a spatially homogeneous background field and its fluctuations _",
    "a(x^)=^0_a(t)+_a(x^ ) .",
    "at the background level , the field equations given by ( [ action ] ) read ^0_a+3h^0_a+=0 . [ back ]",
    "the expansion history is obtained from the first friedmann equation 3m_^2h^2=^0_a^0_a+v(^0_a).[expansion ] where we define @xmath4 .",
    "these equations describe all the quantities needed from the homogeneous limit  such as the scale factor and the masses  and hence , these become a part of the overall evolution scheme .",
    "+ in order to find the spectrum , quantum fluctuations are normally expressed as fourier modes @xmath5 evaluated on a constant time surface , where we are able to set the scale as a constant @xmath6 without loss of generality .",
    "these modes are contained in a second order expansion of ( [ action ] ) s_(k)=a^3dt,[pertact ] where @xmath7 is the well - known `` mass - squared matrix '' modified by the coordinate choice made on ( [ spflat ] ) .",
    "all the equations of motion just follow from variational principle .",
    "initial conditions will be consistent with the high - frequency behaviour @xmath8 , where the solutions for @xmath9 are treated as in minkowski spacetime .",
    "it is important to compute the spectrum of linearized field perturbations at the end of inflation since this is directly related to the spectrum of primordial curvature .",
    "an interesting procedure for this calculation is described in ref.@xcite , where the authors consider the evolved components of a complex `` mode matrix '' , which follows the same equations of motion obtained from ( [ pertact ] ) . in this perspective , more than one time scale is used to resolve the mode correlations .",
    "+ here we present a different approach : a dynamical decomposition method which suppresses the highest oscillation scales in the equations of motion of the correlation modes regardless of the time scale used . hence , the evolution of the correlation modes is more efficient . to achieve that",
    ", we suggest the following extended form of the field _ a = l_ab_b[ansatz ] as an effective way to separate a real matrix of amplitudes @xmath10 from phases @xmath11 on each mode .",
    "we initially assume @xmath12 independent degrees of freedom contained by @xmath13 .",
    "field fluctuations in de sitter spacetime before crossing the horizon only add `` damping '' to the standard massive wave solutions in empty space .",
    "for that reason , it is possible to consider the vector @xmath14 as a set of evolved phases . + by inserting the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) in ( [ pertact ] ) , we get s_&=&a^3dt_ab + & -&l_ac(_ab+m^2_ab)l_bd_c_d[actchi ] and the equations of motion for @xmath15 are & _ e+(3h_eb+2(l^-1)_ed_db)_b+ + & _ b=0[eqmov ] which turn out to be minimally different from the case of coriolis equation written in a rotating non - inertial frame .",
    "the last term corresponds to the effective rotation frequency . calculating the conjugate momentum of @xmath14 from this action , we find @xmath16 , hence the canonical commutators @xmath17=i\\delta_{ab}$ ] now imply = ( l^t)^-1_bc(l^-1)_ca .",
    "[ comm ]    the dependence on @xmath18 is responsible for the suppressed commutators during inflation .",
    "this is consistent with the decoherence conditions stated in ref.@xcite .",
    "transitioning into classical states has dynamical consequences : @xmath19 can be treated as in ref.@xcite , gaussian random variables in which the central limit theorem is fully applicable and a complex phase is convenient in evolving two copies of the same field under different initial conditions . as a result , complexification is no longer a requirement .",
    "in addition to this , our prescription in ( [ ansatz ] ) allows us to rewrite the two - point correlators as _ a,_b = l_acl^t_db_c,_d .",
    "[ corr ]    a similar separation is performed in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is inspired by geometrical optics and considers the evolution of the correlators by describing the elements  i.e. rotations , expansions and shears of the unitary evolution operator acting on each mode . however , our approach is more concerned on the dynamical constraints required to hold a specific gauge choice after the separation in ( [ ansatz ] ) .",
    "+ following the central limit theorem , we can demand independence between different phases ( i.e. a normalized covariance matrix ) at all times .",
    "this is analog to using `` cosine '' or `` sine '' waves as an orthonormal basis for a simple harmonic oscillator with the purpose of maximizing _ amplitude _ and _ velocity _ as initial conditions for the oscillating system .",
    "this independence condition is our gauge choice _",
    "c,_d=_cd,[firstgauge ] and it must be held at all times .",
    "the expression for the correlator in ( [ corr ] ) reduces to _",
    "a,_b = l_acl^t_cb.[gaugedcorr ]",
    "because phases are fast oscillating degrees of freedom and can cancel out , these are not required to calculate two - point correlators .",
    "all information of the correlations is carried by @xmath20 , the slowly varying `` square root '' of the correlation matrix .",
    "we look for an effective set of equations of motion which mainly depend on amplitudes instead of phases .",
    "therefore , we must consider that the evolution of @xmath19 follows the second order differential equations in ( [ eqmov ] ) .",
    "hence , time translational invariance requires two derivatives of ( [ firstgauge ] ) as additional constraints for the system at an arbitrary time slice & ^cd_ab _ c,_d=0,[secondgauge ] + & ^cd_ab = 0,[thirdgauge ] where we define @xmath21 and its antisymmetric analog as ( anti-)symmetrizing multilinear operators .",
    "equations ( [ firstgauge ] ) and ( [ secondgauge ] ) are just constrained by initial conditions . with ( [ eqmov ] ) ,",
    "we can rewrite ( [ thirdgauge ] ) as & ^cd_ab=0[newgauge ] .",
    "in all the terms , symmetrization in both free indices indicates the existence of @xmath22 repeated degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "only when the cases of anticorrelation are discarded , positive definiteness of the correlation matrix is useful to eliminate the redundancy by picking @xmath13 to be cholesky matrices .",
    "these do not have more than @xmath23 non - zero real elements in the lower triangular corner of the matrix .",
    "our choice of cholesky matrices is convenient for a variety of reasons , especially since matrix inversions and other operations are computationally inexpensive and easily scalable for the case of models with a large number of fields .",
    "+ moreover , the largest term in the squared brackets of equation ( [ newgauge ] ) has a gauge symmetry due to the overall symmetrization acting on it .",
    "such a gauge freedom can be exploited to fix the shape of the cholesky representation at all times . only the first two terms in this expression preserve the shape of a cholesky matrix .",
    "as the system evolves , all the other terms will migrate degrees of freedom out of the lower triangular form of @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , we need to add an antisymmetric matrix @xmath25 , which will be canceled out when symmetrized . in fig.[scheme ] , we represent the way in which the cholesky representation is preserved .",
    "gauge fixing condition emerges by supressing the upper diagonal terms @xmath26 & _ cd=-(l^-1)_cem^2_efl_fd- + & ( l^-1)_ce_ef_f,_d+_c,_d .",
    "[ gaugefixing ] thus , cholesky matrices evolve in agreement with & + & + l_ac_cb+_ac_c,_b - l_ac_c,_b=0[gaugefinal ] .",
    "to find appropriate expressions for the expected phase correlators @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we will write the derivatives for each one of the unknown correlators & _ a,_b=^cd_ab_c,_d[dotdot ] + & _ a,_b=_a,_b+_a,_b . the last expression is equivalent to & _ a,_b=^cd_ab + & + ^cd_ab + & = ^cd_ab_c,_d[dotchi ] equation ( [ dotchi ] ) conserves the antisymmetric properties of @xmath29 found in ( [ secondgauge ] ) , whose behavior seems to match the rotation generators in a real vector space . using ( [ eqmov ] ) and ( [ gaugefinal ] ) , we can write equations of motion for the missing two - point correlators & _ a,_b=^cd_ab , and also & _ a,_b= _ ab-3h_a,_b- + & ^cd_ab[eqmovdotchi ] at first glance , the symmetrizer doubles the first coefficients in ( [ eqmovdotdot ] ) . after comparing ( [ eqmovdotdot ] ) with ( [ eqmovdotchi ] )",
    "we notice that @xmath30 , which is consistent with our analogy with the rotation generators in a real vector space .",
    "however , a careful review of all the terms in both expressions reveals that this is not an accurate statement .",
    "henceforth , both correlators are considered as separate elements in the evolving system .",
    "the expressions found in ( [ gaugefinal ] ) , ( [ eqmovdotdot ] ) and ( [ eqmovdotchi ] ) constitute the system of differential equations required to evolve the `` square root '' of the two - point correlators .",
    "it is reasonable to ask about the proper set of values required to initialize the equations of motion as described in ( [ back ] ) and ( [ gaugefinal ] ) .",
    "to do so , we first consider the evolution of the background fields . + alternative choices of a time scale ( such as the number of e - folds @xmath31 ) can only be implemented without affecting the background evolution before the end of inflation .",
    "the application of such scales does not affect the overall performance of any evolution scheme . throughout the rest of the paper , we choose",
    "v(,)=^4+^2 ^ 2 , [ lp4 ] as an example of a multifield non - linear potential .",
    "having a system of highly coupled second order differential equations , we must investigate the behaviour of first and second derivatives for both fields since those provide initial conditions for the background .",
    "thus , we can observe in fig.[fig : phasespace ] three phase space projections of the background field trajectories ,    where @xmath32 is the typical numerical value assigned to the coupling constant . from fig.[fig : phasespace ] , we notice that @xmath33 are suitable choices for the derivatives of the slowly rolling background field .",
    "other values will not modify the convergence time substantially .",
    "the lapse of time the system takes to fall into the inflationary attractor is very small .",
    "however , we always have the option of getting closer to the attractor in order to reduce the convergence time of the complete system of equations , which includes fluctuations .",
    "hence , we are left with two numbers we have to fix in order to achieve enough expansion in the model .",
    "+ in fig.[figureii ] , we generated a `` map '' of initial values for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , including the number of expanded e - folds .",
    "once we choose a set of initial field coordinates , we can ensure the conditions necessary to produce an inflating homogeneous background state considering the potential in ( [ lp4 ] ) . in this case , following the data from the map in fig.[figureii ] , initial conditions were chosen to produce a model expanding for 88 ( approx . )",
    "e - folds , with @xmath36 .",
    "the horizon and all the physical wavenumbers ( @xmath37 ) associated with each perturbation mode evolve according to the curves in plot in fig.[fig : figureiv ] .",
    "+ to describe the evolution of the correlations between perturbations of the different scalar degrees of freedom , we rely on our knowledge of the correlators @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 to provide suitable ( approximate ) initial conditions at @xmath41 .",
    "asymptotic consistency with the field amplitudes in minkowski vacuum with a non - diagonal mass matrix is sufficient to determine these correlation matrices .",
    "diagonalization of the mass matrix in the initial time surface provides estimated values of the correlations in @xmath42 : & d_abu_acu^t_dbm^2_cd , + & _ a,_b_t_0=u^t_acu_db ( ) . where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the diagonal version of @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the orthonormal transformation matrix responsible of the diagonalization .",

    "in order to evaluate the validity of the statements made so far , we produced two codes : the first one generates the correlation matrix by taking correlations of a random sample . in the second one , we solve the system given by ( [ gaugefinal ] ) , ( [ eqmovdotdot ] ) and ( [ eqmovdotchi ] ) . in both scenarios",

    "it is mainly supported by time translational invariance of the approximated minkowski ( or bunch - davies ) vacuum state .",

    "the antisymmetric behaviour is consistent , again , with the notion of these correlators as rotation generators : the rotation transfers power from one mode to another .",
