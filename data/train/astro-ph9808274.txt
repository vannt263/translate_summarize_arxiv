    "30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) exhibits extremely active star formation and interstellar activity .",
    "it serves as an interesting laboratory for the study of the evolution of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and its interaction with massive stars .",
    "many giant gas sheets in this region were identified in deep @xmath9 photographs ( @xcite ) and in 21-cm emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "these shells enclose about ten interlocking superbubbles each about 100  pc in diameters and expanding at about 30  -  50  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "emission and absorption lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite ) revealed a complicated velocity structure which closely correlates with hi components .",
    "the observed components range over @xmath10  =  185  -  307  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "x - ray maps ( @xcite , b ) demonstrate a good correlation with @xmath9 images , indicating that these superbubbles contain hot gas .",
    "it was shown ( @xcite ) that repeated supernova explosions of massive stars play the major role in pressurizing these giant bubbles and evacuating interstellar space , culminating in 600 - 800  pc diameter supershells .",
    "sn1987a in the lmc provided a unique opportunity for studying part of the 30  doradus complex .",
    "ca  ii , na  d and uv absorption lines against sn1987a ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) exhibit groups of lmc components near @xmath10  =  129 ,  171 ,  206 ,  226 ,  250 - 265 and 281  km  s@xmath0 . other studies ( @xcite ) indicate that the components with velocities less than 140  km  s@xmath0 are not associated with the lmc ( and are also weaker ) .",
    "the study of this part of space was greatly boosted by the discovery of the light echoes from sn1987a ( @xcite ) .",
    "as forward scattered light from the sn , light echoes carry information not only about the sn , but also about the interstellar dust which reflect them . in the decade since the first discovery , these light echoes from sn1987a have revealed a great deal of information about this region ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite ) . in a more recent paper ( @xcite )",
    ", we discuss comprehensively the large scale ism structures in the sn1987a foreground , and constructed a three - dimensional ( 3d ) map of these complicated structures from the light echoes .",
    "twelve dust sheets were identified : r310 , r430 , w700 , s730 , n980 , r1170 , sw1400 , nw1500 , w1700 , r1830 , se3140 , and n3240 .",
    "these names are derived from the following rules : the first one or two letters indicate the direction relative to sn1987a , e.g. `` r '' for ring shaped , `` n '' for north and `` se '' for south - east ; the following number is the distance in front of sn1987a in light years .",
    "these structures enclose a 110  pc radius superbubble which interlocks with a smaller , 30  pc bubble , a 600  pc diameter giant superbubble , and a shell which likely envelopes sn1987a .",
    "the giant superbubble appears to have also been observed by another group ( @xcite ) as an oval - shaped dust ring of 1.5 - 2.0  kpc in dimensions in a narrow continuum band ( 4215 ) .",
    "one of the important results from 3d light echo mapping is that the superbubble n157c is not just the smallest `` cavity '' enclosed by the h@xmath11 filaments to the north - east of sn1987a ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "instead , the complicated h@xmath11 structure which extends to the south - west of sn1987a , has a spherical 3d structure whose center of curvature falls on lh90 .",
    "therefore , we think that the n157c supershell extends to a radius of about 115  pc to the south - west , in the direction of sn1987a .",
    "an x - ray map ( @xcite ) reveals a bubble bigger than the small cavity which was believed to be n157c .",
    "the x - ray maps are likely to show where gas is hitting the inner surface of the shell , with gas interior to this probably too diffuse to detect .",
    "the lowest contour level ( 0.0013  photon  s@xmath0  arcmin@xmath12 ) of the partial x - ray ring around the central ob association lh 90 actually extends to a radius of about 60 pc ( 4.0 arcmin ) , but is incomplete to the south and west around its circumference .",
    "it appears that the n157c bubble extends to larger radii towards the west and south , towards the direction of the sn . in the deepest rosat pspc images of the same field ( @xcite ) ,",
    "it is clear that two segments of x - ray emitting gas , roughly concentric with respect to the center of n157c , sit in the region extending into our survey field , the farthest one at a radius of about 100  pc ( @xmath13  arcmin ) with respect to n157c s center .",
    "future observations might reveal if these have the same spectrum as the rest of the x - ray shell .",
    "one can not prove on the basis of x - ray morphology alone where the edge of the superbubble extends in the direction of the sn , but it seems likely to be larger than the 60 pc radius seen at other position angles . in contrast n157c seen in 21-cm emission from h  i extends over at least 200  pc in diameter ( @xcite ) , nearly coextensive with the dust echo .",
    "it is highly desirable to study the velocities of these structures .",
    "echelle emission spectra in the vicinity of sn1987a were reported before ( @xcite ) .",
    "the components were found consistent with absorption structures , with 255 and 280  km  s@xmath0 the two most ubiquitous components . in this paper",
    ", we will present the results of our large field echelle survey around sn1987a and its relation to the ism structures .",
    "section 2 discusses observations and data reduction .",
    "section 3 will explain our numerical model and fitting procedure .",
    "we interpret the velocity map in  4 .",
    "the survey was conducted on 22 - 24 january 1993 and on 16 - 18 january 1994 using the cassegrain echelle spectrograph on the ctio 4 m telescope .",
    "we used an echelle setup of five evenly spaced long slits , oriented north - south .",
    "the slits were @xmath14 long and centered @xmath15.5 apart from each other . with such five slits , every exposure covered a field of @xmath16 . by making the offset between fields @xmath17 north - south and @xmath18 east - west ( hence @xmath19 between adjacent exposures )",
    "there was sufficient overlap north - south to check that we had returned to the same right ascension on later nights ( while the east - west offsets , also double - checked by occasionally re - acquiring the sn , were made in quick succession on the same night ) .",
    "we planned to use 18 such evenly distributed fields to cover a @xmath20 region , from @xmath21 south to @xmath22 north of sn1987a , and from @xmath23 west of to @xmath24 east of sn1987a .",
    "we managed to get 17 fields , not having enough time to observe the south - westernmost corner field .",
    "additionally , two single @xmath25-long slits oriented east - west , one centered on the sn and one centered @xmath26 north of the sn , were also used beforehand to check for structure that might extend beyond the 120  km  s@xmath0 free velocity range between adjacent slits .",
    "no such structure was found , with the exception of a small region in the five - slit data at the edge of the field southeast from the sn .",
    "this corresponds to the `` honeycomb nebula '' ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , where we ignored some data which appeared susceptible to overlap . the configuration of all of these slit positions is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we chose to look at the [ n  ii ] doublet ( air @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xcite ) , and used an h@xmath11 filter ( central wavelength  =  6563 , fwhm=75 ) to separate orders .",
    "we use [ n  ii ] instead of h@xmath11 because the thermal width of h@xmath11 line is about 3.7 times of that of [ n  ii ] line at the same temperature due to the difference in their atomic mass , a critical difference .",
    "resolution of the setup is 10  km  s@xmath0 near [ n  ii ] @xmath29 , and the free velocity range between every two slits is 120  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "exposure time of each field is 3600 seconds .",
    "we used iraf to reduce the data .",
    "the process started with column bias , two - dimensional bias frame subtraction , and dark current subtraction .",
    "bad pixels were interpolated over . the response function image from each night , which was later used to flat field the images , was constructed from combined quartz exposures using the iraf `` response '' task .",
    "we then used the iraf  illumination \" task to fit `` slit functions '' from sky exposures .",
    "these slit functions were then applied in illumination correction to all the object images to give a flat response along slits .",
    "we calibrated the spectra into wavelength space using thar comparison spectra .",
    "the calibration error can be assessed by comparing the measured sky line wavelength to the standard values ( @xcite ) .",
    "we found the error was less than 0.04  , or equivalently 2  km  s@xmath0 at @xmath30 .",
    "this error is only 1/5 of the 10  km  s@xmath0 resolution . because the later process requires a high s / n ratio , we binned the spectra over every @xmath31 .",
    "a continuum was then fit and subtracted from each one of the @xmath31 spectra .",
    "we then scaled the spectra in adjacent fields to the same flux level .",
    "the scaling was possible because we deliberately overlapped each field with its neighbors .",
    "we multiplied spectra of each field by a constant so that neighboring fields have the same @xmath9 and [ n  ii ] ( @xmath32 ) flux in the common region .",
    "finally , night sky lines were properly subtracted from the spectra .",
    "unfortunately , one of the [ n  ii ] doublet ( @xmath27 ) was terribly contaminated by oh - lines . therefore , we only look at the other [ n  ii ] line @xmath29 .",
    "we transformed the spectra into velocity space using the doppler shift formula .",
    "the [ n  ii ] vacuum wavelength are @xmath33 and @xmath34 which are calculated from their air wavelengths with edlen s formula ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is crucial to first identify structures corresponding to each slit , because the 5-slit echelle may cause cross - slit overlap . for this purpose",
    ", we looked at two single slit spectra : one centered on sn1987a , and the other about @xmath35 to the north .",
    "we first binned them over @xmath36 to achieve a high s / n level .",
    "figure 2 show h@xmath11 and [ n  ii]@xmath32 lines of these spectra .",
    "in panels 1 and 3 ( h@xmath11 line ) , the two structures near 0 and 650  km  s@xmath0 are skylines @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( @xcite ) respectively . in panels 2 and 4 ( [ n  ii ]",
    "@xmath32 line ) , the structure near 600  km  s@xmath0 is a skyline @xmath39 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these spectra show that the only interesting structures are in 210 - 330  km  s@xmath0 interval , which is within our slit - to - slit free range .",
    "although this conclusion is technically correct only in the region on and to the north of sn1987a , we think it is very unlikely that some extraordinary low or high velocity structure would appear only to the south of sn1987a , since most structures are seen to be weaker there .      the goal of numerical analysis is to identify the number of velocity components and to measure the properties of each component , e.g.  velocity , intensity and fwhm .",
    "our analysis was a two - step process .",
    "we first fit the data with various numerical models with up to five gaussian components .",
    "then based on the fitting result , we used a statistical algorithm to select the correct component numbers .",
    "first , we varied the number of gaussian components from one to five to produce five different models .",
    "these models were fitted separately to the spectra using least @xmath40 fitting to determine the parameters .",
    "because the temperature of each component in the lmc should not change very much , and hence the fwhm of each component should be roughly the same , we forced a uniform fwhm across components within each model , while the height and position were allowed to vary freely and independently from each other . to check out the `` uniform fwhm '' assumption",
    ", we repeated the whole process but let fwhms vary as free variables .",
    "the `` model probability '' method ( see below ) selected the same number of components in every field , regardless the assumption on fwhms .",
    "we also noticed that the velocities of corresponding components are a little different , but within our resolution .",
    "therefore , we think our modeling based on the `` uniform fwhm '' assumption is robust .",
    "the fitting was performed with the `` deblend '' option of iraf s `` splot '' task .",
    "we chose to work interactively because the components are normally not well separated and automatic fitting tends to yield wild results .",
    "based on the least @xmath40 fitting result , we computed the probability that a `` correct '' model would yield a higher @xmath40 than the actually fitted result .",
    "the selection rule is that the most likely model has the maximum probability .",
    "it has been shown that the probability defined in this way satisfies a @xmath40-distribution and consequently can be calculated ( @xcite ) .",
    "for every profile , we compared the five models based on their probabilities , and select the one with the highest probability . in most cases , we found the `` correct '' model yields a probability several orders of magnitude higher than other models , and hence convincingly establishes itself .",
    "for a few profiles , two or three models have similar probabilities . in these situations",
    ", we made our choices by continuity argument .",
    "we look at the neighboring locations for any definitely `` correct '' models , and select the most similar one .",
    "figure 3 shows the reduced data from one of our 17 fields , detailing the [ n  ii]@xmath32 line , and the result from our velocity component analysis graphed on a corresponding scale in the adjacent diagram .",
    "the analysis reveals all of the major features and nearly all weaker ones , and follows gradients in the velocities of components with reasonable accuracy .    with the aforementioned process",
    ", we determined at every grid point over all 17 fields the number of components and properties of each component .",
    "we then looked into the connection among these grid points for collective structures across the field .",
    "the result will be discussed in the next section .",
    "this survey shows the following ionized clouds : @xmath10 = 237 , 245 , 255 , 265 , 277 , 285 , 300 , and 313  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "( when clouds are within about 5  km  s@xmath0 of each other , they tend to blend together . )",
    "these are shown in figure 4a .",
    "the @xmath41 km  s@xmath0 grouping is sufficiently complex that we show it separately in figure 4b .",
    "four of these components ( 255 , 277 , 300 and 313 ) were also reported in a smaller field containing sn1987a ( @xcite ) .",
    "two of them , @xmath42 and 277  km  s@xmath0 were discovered in the interstellar absorption spectra toward sn1987a ( see the citations in  1 ) .",
    "a hi 21-cm study in this region exhibited similar profiles : @xmath10 = 243 , 274 , 296 and 318  km  s@xmath0 ( @xcite ) .",
    "similar structures were also discovered in the halo of 30 doradus from [ o  iii ] lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in our survey , we found the 245 and 255  km  s@xmath0 components ( group b in figure 4a ) have similar properties and hence are likely to be two layers of one structure ( see  4.3 below ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath10 = 265 , 277 and 285  km  s@xmath0 clouds ( group c and figure 4b ) are seen to be interrelated with each other and even connected in some places .",
    "( some components are seen to disappear into others when approach within the 5  km  s@xmath0 blending range . )",
    "we think these three are really one structure ( see  4.1 below ) .",
    "the two high velocity clouds ( 300 and 313  km  s@xmath0 ; group d ) are likely to be the far side of the 245 - 255  km  s@xmath0 shell (  4.3 , see also @xcite ) . the other component ( 237  km  s@xmath0 ; group a ) is reported for the first time in this study .",
    "it is interesting that we did not see this component in the two single long slit spectra , one centered on sn1987a and the other @xmath35 north of the supernova .",
    "we show in  4.2 that this component correlates to the two clouds about 1 kpc in front of sn1987a ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath10 = 265 , 277 and 285  km  s@xmath0 group ( c in figure 4a , also seen in figure 4b ) is the most far reaching structure in this field .",
    "they not only are interrelated with each other , but also have comparable flux level consistently bright throughout the whole field .",
    "similar behavior was observed in [ o  iii ] and @xmath9 emission lines ( @xcite ) , in the hi 21-cm survey ( @xcite ) , and in ca  ii , na  d and uv absorption lines ( see  1 for references ) . therefore , it is tempting to recognize these three components as one dominant structure in front of sn1987a . in an earlier paper ( @xcite ) , we show that the most prominent structure in the sn foreground is the echo 1170 light - years in the sn foreground , the r1170-complex ( identified as n157c ) .",
    "this similarity marks the first correlation indicating that these velocity components are indeed n157c .    as another piece of evidence",
    ", we plotted the flux contour of these components on top of the 2d image of the ism dust structure , the r1170-complex ( @xcite ) ( figure 5 ) .",
    "this plot shows a general tendency that both structures are bright to the north of sn1987a .",
    "in addition , we observed a good correlation not only on the large scale but also at many small bright spots , limited by the spatial accuracy of the echelle survey of @xmath43 east - west and @xmath44 north - south .",
    "we also observed that the two structures split in the same way .",
    "the 3d light echo map ( @xcite ) demonstrated that the cloud , consisting of n1500 and w1700 , splits from r1170 to the north of sn1987a and joins r1830 southwest of the sn .",
    "similarly , figure 4b shows the 277  km  s@xmath0 component joining the 285  km  s@xmath0 component to the south ( and slightly east ) of sn1987a and the 265  km  s@xmath0 component to the southwest .",
    "this geometry is consistent with the picture that the 285 and the 265  km  s@xmath0 components are the far and near shell of n157c , while the 277  km  s@xmath0 component is a cloud joining the two structures to form a superbubble .",
    "n157c , with a diameter of about 200 pc , is expanding at a speed of 10  km  s@xmath0 , therefore .",
    "we believe this bubble is still in the pressure - driven stage for the following reasons .",
    "first , this size is common in other parts of the lmc , particularly in 30 doradus ( @xcite ) .",
    "most of these giant bubbles are young and rapidly expanding ( @xcite ) .",
    "mccray and kafatos ( 1987 ) attributed the generally large superbubble size to the thick gas disk of the lmc and its low metallicity .",
    "secondly , the interior of a pressure - driven bubble is filled with hot gas as opposed to the cool interior in the snow - plow stage .",
    "in addition , wang and helfand ( 1991b ) reported x - ray ( @xmath45 ) emission in n157c , corresponding to very hot gas in its interior .",
    "therefore , n157c is in the energy - conservation stage .",
    "mccray and kafatos ( 1987 ) gave the radius and velocity properties for these bubbles : @xmath46 dividing one equation by the other , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the gas atomic density , and @xmath49yr .",
    "let @xmath50  pc , @xmath51  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we estimate the age of n157c to be @xmath52  myr .",
    "therefore , this superbubble is still very young .",
    "it is estimated ( @xcite ) that stellar winds from a rich cluster ( @xmath53 ) dominate its superbubble expansion for a few million years until supernova explosions become more important , while the superbubble may expand to less than @xmath54 pc .",
    "we think n157c has just passed the stellar - wind - driven stage , and is in rapid expansion driven by powerful supernovae from lh90 .    from other sources , we estimate the neutral hydrogen column density @xmath55 of the supershell n157c . from 21  cm emission ( @xcite ) ,",
    "about 70% of the h  i column density towards lh90 is contained in a narrow component centered at 270  km  s@xmath0 , with a total column density of all components of about @xmath56  cm@xmath12 .",
    "this total @xmath55 is corroborated from the pointing ( # 43 ) containing n157c from the survey of @xcite : @xmath58  cm@xmath12 , and the value inferred from the damping wings of the ly @xmath11 absorption line towards the star sk  @xmath59 , in the direction of n157c : @xmath60  cm@xmath12 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus the value of @xmath55 for n157c is about @xmath61  cm@xmath12 .",
    "( however , none of these surveys have resolution better than about @xmath62 , so we can not be sure of the effects of substructure . )",
    "since this column density is optically thick at the lyman limit , we will assume the gas is shielded and therefore largely neutral .",
    "accounting for projection effects ( a factor of four ) , the kinetic energy of the expanding hi shell is therefore @xmath63 ergs .",
    "this implies a total kinetic output from sne that is @xmath64 times greater ( @xcite ) : @xmath65  ergs .",
    "each typical type ii supernova of a massive o star releases about @xmath66 ergs of kinetic energy . given an average supernova rate of about one per million years in a typical ob association ( @xcite ) , the energy budget is consistent with the aforementioned age estimate .",
    "given @xmath67 determined from theoretical consideration of a sn driven expansion ( @xcite ) : @xmath68 we find @xmath69 . combining this with equation 1 ( or 2 ) yields an initial density @xmath70 .",
    "this is a reasonable estimate , corresponding to the @xmath71 cm@xmath12 spread over a scale height of @xmath72  pc , which is reasonable in terms of the observed 3-d structure .    on the other hand , from stellar content point of view",
    ", the aforementioned estimate @xmath73 implies several massive sn explosions in lh90 , given that the typical energy of a type ii sn , @xmath74 , is a few for the most massive stars ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the main - sequence lifetimes of massive stars are given approximately by @xmath76  myr@xmath77)^{-\\alpha } $ ] , where @xmath78 for @xmath79 ( @xcite ) and by @xmath80  myr@xmath81^{-0.5}$ ] for @xmath82 ( @xcite ) . in a time scale of 6",
    "myr , only a few very massive stars with ( @xmath83 would explode . it is estimated that an ob association should produce roughly 9 times as many stars with masses in the range 7 - 30 @xmath84 ( main - sequence spectral type b3 - 08 , corresponding to @xmath85 ) as stars with masses @xmath86 ( ms type o7 - 03 ) ( @xcite ) . given that there are about 50 stars with mass @xmath87 ( @xcite ) , there should be about 5 massive stars of @xmath88 which should have exploded .",
    "we can also compare our predicted sn explosion number to empirical determinations of the stellar population .",
    "in addition to the original study of lh 90 ( @xcite ) , two recent studies of the stellar population of the association yield somewhat different results .",
    "recent uit data ( @xcite ) on lh90 and six other lh ob associations in all but the inner portion of the 30 dor complex give the number of stars and their inferred mass . for the clusters with the largest mass stars ( @xmath89 ) ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath90 versus @xmath91 stars predicted in the previous paragraph from theoretical estimations appears inconsistent with the uit data , in the sense that more massive stars are actually seen by uit . from these data",
    ", lh90 appears to have stars as massive as @xmath92 , while lh89 and lh99 show about eight stars more massive than this ( out of a total of 40 stars in lh90 and 68 stars in lh89 and lh99 more massive than @xmath93 ) .",
    "thus lh90 might be missing approximately five stars of @xmath94 ( or more if stars have exploded in lh89 or lh99 ) ; these have presumably formed sne .",
    "we should note , however , the existence of stars in lh90 more massive than those allowed ( @xmath95 ) by a 6  myr year turnoff age .",
    "perhaps some massive stars were created millions of years after the first stars .",
    "indeed , our prediction for the number of massive stars seems more consistent with the results from the other study ( @xcite ) , which uses optical photometry and spectroscopy of lh 90 to derive spectral types and @xmath96 values consistent with about 7 stars with @xmath88 versus more than 47 stars with mass @xmath87 ( according to our simple conversion of @xmath96 to @xmath97 ) .",
    "indeed , their study concludes that the association contains a sub - population 3 - 4  myr old and a possible larger sub - population 7 - 8  myr old ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with our arguments regarding the sn rate .",
    "xu , crotts and kunkel ( 1994 ) first reported two dust bodies at about 1 kpc in front of sn1987a .",
    "they ( @xcite ) also found that the southeast piece of these two correlates with one of the bright @xmath9 filaments extending from n157c discovered by meaburn ( 1984 ) .",
    "they went one step further to suggest this filament as the near side and n157c as the far side of a giant superbubble of 600 pc in diameter .",
    "consistent with this picture , a component at 235  km  s@xmath0 ( `` a '' in figure 4a ) has been found in the regions far away from sn1987a .",
    "figure 6 plots flux contour of this component over the image of se3140 and n3240 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we found that one piece of the 235  km  s@xmath0 components corresponds exactly to n3240 , and another piece correlates with se3140 .",
    "it is unfortunate that we only had enough time to finish the survey to the north of dec @xmath98 and to the west of ra 5h 36 m 00s ( in j2000 ) delineated by the dashed lines .",
    "still , the available data indicates that 235  km  s@xmath0 gives a good correlation with se3140 , expanding at about 40  km  s@xmath0 relative to the centroid of n157c .",
    "it is interesting to see the 235  km  s@xmath0 component distributed in a patchy ring - like shape .",
    "recent light echo images ( 1995 - 1997 ) showed n3140 becoming larger and extending to the position angle @xmath99 where the @xmath100 235  km  s@xmath0 components is located . therefore , we think the 1 kpc ism structure may indeed show a hole in front of sn1987a . moreover , we have several reasons to believe this hole may relate to the blow - out of the 600-pc - diameter superbubble .",
    "first , we have not observed any structure within @xmath101 of sn1987a either in the light echoes at 1 kpc or in the echelle survey at 235  km  s@xmath0 , indicating that the cloud has been fragmented .",
    "this result can be explained by a superbubble blow - out .",
    "secondly , wang and helfand ( 1991b , c ) reported that this region has soft x - ray emission much higher than the background but much lower than other young superbubbles in 30 doradus .",
    "this region may even be contained in the possible giant superbubble lmc-2 , roughly 1  kpc across ( @xcite ) which has blown out of the disk .",
    "finally , 600 pc is one of the largest superbubbles ever observed in the lmc ( @xcite ) , and therefore may represent a size close to the upper limit imposed on the superbubble size by the lmc disk thickness . in conclusion , we think this 600 pc diameter giant superbubble appears to have blown out of the lmc disk and is expanding in radius ( assuming it is pushing on one side against n157c ) at 20  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "mccray and kafatos ( 1987 ) suggested that when the superbubble cools or breaks out of the galaxy , it will be distorted by gravitational instability , collapse and form giant clouds , and finally ignite propagating star formation .",
    "lh90 , which formed n157c , may have itself formed in this way in the gravitational collapse of the 600 pc giant bubble .",
    "if this superbubble blew out in its snow - plow stage , prior to this it was described in terms of the time ( @xmath102 ) and expansion radius ( @xmath103 ) beyond which cooling becomes important in the interior e.g.  post - adiabatically according to ( @xcite ) : @xmath104 for @xmath105 and @xmath106 where @xmath107 is metallicity , @xmath85 is number of stars @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath48 is gas atomic density . in the lmc , @xmath110 ( @xcite ) and a density typical for the lmc ( several times lower than near n157c ) , @xmath111 ( @xcite ) . let s guess @xmath112 ( roughly that of n157c ) and @xmath113 , hence @xmath114  myr , and @xmath115  kpc , much bigger than 300  pc .",
    "therefore , we think this giant bubble was probably hot when it blew out , implying an age at the time of blowout of about 10  myr from eq .  3 , or 15  myr using eq .  1 and the ( less certain ) parameters above",
    "these are probably consistent with the age of lmc-2 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this appears older than n157c , indicating the 600  pc superbubble predates it , and may have even brought about lh90 s formation .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the two dense clouds ( r430-complex including r310 ) about 100  pc in front of sn1987a do not correspond to any prominent @xmath9 structures , and therefore are likely related primarily to sn1987a .",
    "r430 is brighter and larger than r310 .",
    "the lack of correlation is also consistent with the assertion that sn1987a exploded about 300  pc on the far side of the lmc disk ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure 7 plots flux contour of @xmath10 = 255 and 245  km  s@xmath0 ( group b in figure 4a ) on top of r430-complex , indicating a good correlation between these two images . on the other hand ,",
    "the 255  km  s@xmath0 component is brighter and larger than 245  km  s@xmath0 component , in good agreement with the relative size and brightness of r430 and r310 .",
    "the correlation between these two studies indicates that the double shell structure r430 and r310 have velocities 255  km  s@xmath0 and 245  km  s@xmath0 respectively .",
    "the 255  km  s@xmath0 component was reported by other groups before ( see @xcite and the reference therein ) .",
    "however , meaburn ( 1990 ) suggested that the 255  km  s@xmath0 shell is within 10 pc of sn1987a .",
    "two other ionized clouds @xmath116 and @xmath117 in the echelle spectra ( group d in figure 4a ) do not correspond to any absorption structures . it was suggested ( @xcite ) that these two clouds are likely to be the far side of a superbubble which envelops sn1987a .",
    "we noticed that this identification is consistent with the double shell structure on the near side .",
    "unfortunately , the light echoes have expanded to only several light years behind sn1987a .",
    "so far , we do not have any direct light echo results on these two possible double shells on the far side of the supernova .",
    "therefore , we can only speculate on the structures of these two high speed components .    if these two components are indeed on the far side of a superbubble surrounding sn1987a , this superbubble is expanding in radius at 30  km  s@xmath0 . if we adopt a average radius of 90 pc ,",
    "the age of this bubble is about 2  myr , ( eq .  1 ) .",
    "let the shell density of this bubble @xmath118 ( @xcite ) , using the same method in  4.1 , we calculate the total energy of this superbubble to be @xmath4 ergs , which is the energy of two to three typical type ii supernovae . both the energy budget and the age suggest that there had been a small number of supernova explosions before sn1987a in this superbubble .",
    "because of the short lifetime of this bubble , these previously exploded supernovae must be very massive stars ( @xmath119 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the aforementioned superbubble assertion has some problems .",
    "first , there are not many stars close to sn1987a . even though one may argue that massive stars might have exploded , the lack of low mass stars is still a difficulty .",
    "second , the expansion velocity of 30  km  s@xmath0 is too high compared to that of n157c ( 10  km  s@xmath0 ) which is pressurized by the second richest cluster lh90 . the only way around this problem is to assume very low gas density in this region . in equation 2 , adopt @xmath120  km  s@xmath0 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , we get @xmath123 , which is an order of magnitude lower than the typical lmc value of @xmath124 ( @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps this is reasonable , given sn1987a s likely distance from the plane of the lmc , but the existence of a superbubble surrounding sn1987a is still not certain .",
    "we also noticed that there are two components at 269 and 301  km  s@xmath0 within @xmath8 of sn1987a .",
    "they have much higher flux level than those probably more distant components at 245 , 255 and 317  km  s@xmath0 ( and at 300  km  s@xmath0 not within @xmath8 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that these structures are probably due to the emission from the red supergiant wind ( @xcite ) .",
    "this structure will be treated in a separate paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "these two components have been reported previously ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note that our light echo 3-d map , in conjunction with the velocities of the matter in front of the sn from this study , implies that the sn is well behind most of the material in its portion of the lmc , and hints at how this occurred .",
    "this refutes claims made on the basis of extinction towards a nearby star , sk  @xmath125203 , that the sn is embedded in the middle of the main h  i complex ( @xcite ) .",
    "we approximate the speed of lh90 with that of n157c , about 270  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "this should also represent the speed of the lmc stellar disk .",
    "therefore , sn1987a is moving away from the lmc disk at a speed of 20  km  s@xmath0 given that the velocity of sn1987a of 289  km  s@xmath0 ( @xcite ) . at this speed",
    ", it would have taken the sn1987a progenitor @xmath126 years to move to its current location 300  pc away from the stellar disk .",
    "it is interesting to compare this time scale to the lifetime of n157c ( 6  myr ,  4.1 ) as well as that of the speculated superbubble surrounding sn1987a ( 2  myr ,  4.3 ) , and that of the progenitor itself .",
    "we speculate that the sn and n157c were created together ( followed by the superbubble around sn  1987a ) , and are pursuing further methods to test this .",
    "the authors would like to thank cerro tololo inter - american observatory for granting observing time to this study and all the wonderful support that we have received .",
    "we would also like to direct our gratitude to rob olling and david helfand for many enlightening discussions .",
