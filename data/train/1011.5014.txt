    "since the initial proposals of spin - based quantum information processing@xcite in solids , methods of controlling individual spins in a scalable fashion have drawn considerable attention@xcite . an especially attractive method for independently controlling spins spaced much closer than an optical spot size is to locally modify some of the spin s properties with an electric field .",
    "this approach s advantages include well - developed and commercial techniques for generating large arrays of independently controllable electric gates .",
    "initial proposals focused on modifying the resonant frequency of a spin in a magnetic field using spatially - dependent @xmath4 factors@xcite or hyperfine fields@xcite , however this approach requires a spatially - extended always - on microwave field with which local spins are brought in and out of resonance .",
    "a superior approach replaces electric - field control of a resonance frequency with electric - field control of the magnetic or pseudomagnetic field experienced by the spin , which can produce spin resonance when the electric field is oscillated at the resonance frequency .",
    "electric - field control of the magnetic field has been demonstrated by moving an electron back and forth ( using electric field control of the location of quantum confinement of a quantum dot ) in an inhomogeneous magnetic field@xcite .",
    "electric - field control of a pseudomagnetic field has largely focused on modifying the orbital moment of an electron , which then affects the @xmath4 tensor through the spin - orbit interaction ; this approach goes by the name @xmath4 tensor modulation resonance , and has been demonstrated in quantum wells@xcite and also proposed for electron spin manipulation in quantum dots@xcite , for donor - bound electrons@xcite , and for holes in quantum dot molecules@xcite .",
    "advantages of using hole spins instead of electron spins for @xmath4 tensor modulation resonance include the larger spin - orbit interaction and orbital angular momenta in the valence band , the stronger dependence ( and asymmetry ) of hole @xmath4 tensors on structural shape@xcite , and possibly reduced hyperfine interactions .",
    "the larger spin - orbit interaction for holes and larger orbital angular momenta lead to larger hole @xmath4 tensor components .",
    "if the fractional change in orbital angular momentum with applied electric field is comparable for electrons and holes , then the variation in @xmath4 tensor components should be much larger for holes , leading to much more rapid spin manipulation . to achieve rapid @xmath4 tensor modulation resonance",
    "it is especially advantageous to have one tensor component that changes as the other is larger unaffected@xcite .",
    "this can be achieved by considering a highly anisotropic dot shape .",
    "zero in - plane @xmath4 tensor components were predicted for holes in self - assembled inas / gaas quantum dots with a circular footprint@xcite , although once the footprint becomes elliptical these @xmath4 tensor components grow rapidly@xcite .",
    "other calculations have shown non - zero in - plane @xmath4 tensor components in ge / si,@xcite and iii - v nanowhisker@xcite quantum dots as well as in a two - dot inas / gaas quantum dot molecule@xcite .",
    "experimental measurements have seen small , but non - zero in - plane hole @xmath4 factors in inp / ingap@xcite , cdse / znse@xcite and ingaas / gaas quantum dots@xcite . as an extreme example , in a ge / si nanowire quantum dot , electrical control of the @xmath4 tensor component parallel to the wire has been experimentally realized by varying the voltage on the electrostatic gates which define the dot@xcite . another extreme asymmetric structure is the vertically - coupled quantum - dot molecule , in which efficient hole @xmath4 tensor modulation by electric fields has been predicted@xcite , including the possibility of spin echo@xcite .",
    "hole spins have very short lifetimes in bulk , due to angular - momentum mixing and state degeneracy typically found in the valence band@xcite , but this lifetime increases in quantum dots up to the same order of magnitude as electron spin lifetimes@xcite . because the hole bloch functions have @xmath5-like character , the contact term of the hyperfine coupling to the nuclear spin is zero , leaving only orbital hyperfine coupling to the nuclear spin .",
    "the resulting hyperfine interaction has been shown to be highly anisotropic for holes in quantum dots , with a pure heavy - hole state with the pseudospin aligned along the @xmath6 axis having little or no hyperfine coupling@xcite .",
    "recent experiments have found hole @xmath7 times of @xmath8  ns@xcite . in order to make a quantum computer ,",
    "at least @xmath9 operations must be performed during the decoherence time.@xcite these recent experimental @xmath10 values suggest a minimum spin manipulation time no shorter than 10 - 50  ps .    here",
    "we predict that both resonant and nonresonant spin manipulation is possible in holes in a single @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 quantum dot using a single vertical electrical gate , and that the spin manipulation times are more rapid than those for electron spins in the same quantum dots .",
    "we also find that the nonlinearity of the @xmath4 tensor components with applied electric field is highly anisotropic , with a much stronger quadratic electric field dependence of the @xmath4 tensor component parallel to the electric field direction than perpendicular to it .",
    "such quadratic electric field dependences have previously been studied for systems of high symmetry , like donor states@xcite , for which the linear electric field dependence vanishes . here",
    "we find that these nonlinear @xmath4 tensor components generate highly anisotropic _ subharmonic _ resonances which effectively manipulate the hole spin . for magnetic fields of @xmath11",
    "t the spin manipulation times are of the order of 20 - 30  ps for electric fields @xmath12  kv / cm .",
    "we have computed @xmath4 tensors for holes confined in lens - shaped @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 self - assembled quantum dots as a function of an electric field applied along the growth direction and ranging from @xmath13  kv / cm to @xmath14  kv / cm .",
    "the states were calculated using an eight - band @xmath15 strain - dependent hamiltonian@xcite in the envelope approximation using finite differences on a real - space grid@xcite .",
    "this method has been used previously to calculate @xmath4 tensors of electrons in both quantum dots@xcite and bound to donors@xcite .",
    "the large electric fields considered here would ionize an electron in these dots@xcite , however holes remain confined due to their large effective mass .",
    "whereas bulk holes have @xmath16 , in a self - assembled dot the geometric asymmetry and strain break the four - fold degeneracy , resulting in doubly degenerate levels that are mixtures of heavy and light holes .",
    "although the lowest hole state is a doublet ( mostly heavy hole , with small light hole components ) , none of the eight envelope functions is identically zero and therefore the doublet energies will be split by a magnetic field pointing in any direction .",
    "the hole @xmath4 tensor component for a magnetic field @xmath17 applied in a direction @xmath18 was found by calculating the splitting @xmath19 to obtain @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the bohr magneton .",
    "we follow the convention for holes of including a factor of @xmath22 in the denominator ( reflecting @xmath23 ) even though the states form a two - level system and are not pure heavy hole .",
    "the sign of @xmath24 was determined from the spin orientation of the ground state wave function , with @xmath25 for the spin pointing antiparallel to @xmath26 .",
    "since the lens - shaped dots were elongated along the @xmath27 $ ] direction the principal axes were @xmath27 $ ] , @xmath28 $ ] , and @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "spin splittings were computed for @xmath26 along each of these symmetry directions to obtain each @xmath24 .",
    "earlier investigations of electron spin manipulation using an electrically controlled @xmath4 tensor identified the importance of having a @xmath4 tensor component that changes sign with electric field@xcite .",
    "if the sign of one @xmath24 can be changed with an applied electric field , then it is possible to precess the spin to point in an arbitrary direction by only changing the electric field ( in the presence of a suitably oriented static magnetic field ) .",
    "we have identified a dot geometry having the desired sign change , with a height of @xmath30 , a @xmath31 base along the minor axis ( @xmath27 $ ] direction ) and @xmath32 along the major axis ( @xmath28 $ ] direction ) .",

    "of particular note is the sign change of the @xmath4 tensor component along the @xmath29 $ ] direction .",

    ". therefore , there are two possible electric field values around which nonresonant spin manipulation may be done over the entire bloch sphere as described in ref .  .",
    "this double sign change limits the range over which such spin manipulation may be performed , as the limited range of @xmath36}|$ ] constrains the effective spin precession frequency .",
