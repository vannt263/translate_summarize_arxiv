    "the two - dimensional single - band hubbard model has been widely used to study the role of coulomb correlations in the high-@xmath4 cuprates .",
    "one of the remarkable features of this model was pointed out long ago by eskes _",
    "@xcite , namely , that doping the system with @xmath1 holes does not yield unoccupied low - energy states of weight @xmath5 per spin , like in an ordinary band insulator . instead , as a result of strong local coulomb interactions ,",
    "this weight is approximately given by @xmath0 .",
    "the physical reason for this feature is that both lower and upper hubbard bands must contribute to the generation of itinerant low - energy states when holes are added to the system .    in striking contrast to this prediction , recent x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) data on tl@xmath6ba@xmath6cuo@xmath7 and la@xmath8sr@xmath9cuo@xmath10 by peets _",
    "_ @xcite show a linear behavior @xmath11 only up to about @xmath12 . at doping concentrations in the range @xmath13 , @xmath2 levels off , suggesting the inapplicability of the single - band hubbard model for these high-@xmath4 compounds .",
    "since the calculations by eskes _",
    "_ @xcite were carried out for small one - dimensional clusters , it is not entirely clear to what extent the discrepancies with respect to the data in ref.@xcite might be related to the simplicity of the theoretical model .",
    "in fact , phillips and jarrell@xcite recently claimed that state - of - the - art many - body calculations based on the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca)@xcite do indeed predict a saturation of @xmath2 close to @xmath12 , in agreement with the measurements by peets _",
    "et al . _",
    "the aim of this work is to demonstrate that the doping variation of the spectral weight of the induced low - energy states depends crucially on the choice of the upper limit of the energy window in which these states are counted.@xcite to evaluate @xmath2 for the two - dimensional hubbard model we use the cluster extension of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite combined with finite - temperature exact diagonalization ( ed).@xcite the results show that , if the integration window of @xmath2 is chosen to reach up to the lower edge of the upper hubbard band , then @xmath0 , just as predicted by eskes _",
    "et al._@xcite if the cutoff energy , however , is chosen to lie in the range of the pseudogap , then @xmath2 is much smaller than @xmath1 and approximately saturates near @xmath3 , as found in ref.@xcite it is clear , therefore , that the interpretation of the xas measurements must be based on the correct choice of the energy window over which the induced low - energy states are taken into account .",
    "the cluster dmft calculations are carried out for the two - dimensional hubbard model with nearest and next - nearest hopping parameters @xmath14  ev and @xmath15  ev , respectively ( band width @xmath16  ev ) .",
    "the onsite coulomb interaction is @xmath17  ev and the temperature is @xmath18  ev . with this choice of parameters",
    "the system is a mott insulator in the zero doping limit . to account for intersite correlations ,",
    "the square lattice is viewed as a superlattice consisting of @xmath19 clusters .",
    "details of these finite - temperature ed / dmft calculations can be found in ref.@xcite    -7 mm  ( a )    -5 mm    -7 mm  ( b )    figure 1 shows the spectral distributions for a series of hole doping concentrations . for simplicity , we show the ed cluster spectra as they can be evaluated directly at real @xmath20 without requiring analytical continuation .",
    "since we are primarily concerned here with integrated sections of the density of states , these cluster spectra are adequate for our analysis .",
    "the electron density per spin is given by @xmath21 .",
    "at all dopings , the upper hubbard band is seen to be separated from the low - energy states by a broad minimum related to the mott gap in the half - filled limit .",
    "the lower edge of this band gradually shifts from @xmath22  ev at low doping to about 3.0  ev at large doping .",
    "the low - energy states close to @xmath23 reveal a pseudogap at about 50  mev for doping up to about 0.1 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that the origin of this pseudogap can be traced back to a prominent collective mode in the imaginary part of the @xmath24 component of the self - energy .",
    "( see also ref.@xcite ) this mode is therefore directly linked to spatial fluctuations within the @xmath19 clusters and can not be described within single - site dmft .",
    "electron - addition states in the vicinity of this collective mode are highly damped , giving rise to a pseudogap .",
    "in fact , the energy and strength of this mode exhibit a clear dispersion with doping , which translates into a corresponding doping variation of the mean position and width of the pseudogap .",
    "moreover , since the collective mode is located slightly above @xmath25 , states in this energy range have a much shorter lifetime than states below @xmath25 , giving rise to a pronounced particle - hole asymmetry . as shown in ref.@xcite the low - energy region of the dmft lattice spectra , obtained via analytical continuation of the cluster self - energy to real @xmath20 , are fully compatible with the cluster spectra given here in fig .  1",
    ". these lattice spectra are also qualitatively consistent with the corresponding low - energy range of the dca spectra for 16-site clusters ( using @xmath26 ) derived in ref.@xcite    -7 mm  ( a )    -5 mm    -7 mm  ( b )    the spectra in fig .  1",
    "demonstrate that the low - energy states induced via hole doping are concentrated near @xmath25 only at very low doping . with increasing doping ,",
    "these states spread over a larger energy window , until at unit doping an uncorrelated empty band appears between @xmath25 and the shifted upper band edge at 2  ev .",
    "evidently , upon hole doping , spectral weight transfer from the upper hubbard band is limited to the region close to @xmath25 only at very low doping . at larger doping ,",
    "unoccupied spectral weight is generated in the entire range up to @xmath27 .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows the integrated spectral weight of the doping - induced low - energy states , @xmath2 , where the upper edge @xmath28 of the energy window lies in the broad minimum below the upper hubbard band . in the present case",
    "a convenient choice is @xmath29  ev .",
    "( the low - doping behavior of @xmath2 was previously shown in fig .  5 of ref.@xcite )",
    "the results demonstrate that @xmath30 in the entire doping range , consistent with the predictions by eskes _",
    "et al._@xcite    figure 2(b ) shows the integrated spectral weight for a variety of fixed , doping - independent cutoff energies . for @xmath28 in the range of the pseudogap ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath31  ev , @xmath2 remains much smaller than @xmath1 and approximately saturates near @xmath3 .",
    "the reason for this saturation is that , as pointed out above , spectral weight transfer from the upper hubbard band must proceed at larger doping progressively to states farther above @xmath25 , eventually covering the range up to @xmath27 .",
    "for @xmath32  ev , @xmath0 , in agreement with fig .",
    "for @xmath33  ev , the energy window at low doping includes part of the upper hubbard band ( see fig .  1 )",
    ", so that @xmath2 does not reach zero in the small doping limit . in the limit @xmath34 ( not shown ) , @xmath2 includes all unoccupied states .",
    "thus , @xmath35 . to capture properly the integrated spectral weight of the doping - induced low - energy states it is evidently necessary to adjust the cutoff energy so that it roughly tracks the lower edge of the upper hubbard band .",
    "-7 mm  ( a )    -5 mm    -7 mm  ( b )    the cluster dmft results discussed above are for @xmath17  ev . as can be seen in fig .  1 , the upper hubbard band is separated from the itinerant unoccupied states by a rather wide gap of about @xmath36  ev , regardless of doping .",
    "the low - energy spectral peak can therefore be defined without ambiguity .",
    "since there is some uncertainty concerning the appropriate value of @xmath37 for the high-@xmath4 cuprates , we have calculated the spectral distributions also for @xmath38  ev . as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the upper hubbard band then lies about 1  ev lower and overlaps the upper part of the uncorrelated density of states . the distinction between localized and itinerant states is therefore less clear than for @xmath17  ev .",
    "nonntheless , the high - energy peak is still separated from the low - energy region by a shallow minimum , except in the limit of small doping . at this coulomb energy ,",
    "the system is barely insulating at half - filling , so that the separation between itinerant and localized states at small doping becomes highly ambiguous .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows the integrated weight of the low - energy feature , where the minimum close to the lower edge of the upper hubbard band is used as cutoff energy , i.e. , @xmath39  ev for @xmath40 . because of",
    "the uncertainties pointed out above , @xmath2 does not approach zero in the low - doping limit .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath0 , in agreement with the prediction by eskes _",
    "et al._@xcite compared to the analogous spectral peak for @xmath17  ev , @xmath2 is slightly larger for @xmath38  ev .",
    "this trend is also consistent with the results discussed in ref.@xcite the reason for this enhancement is the less clear distinction between itinerant and localized unoccupied states for smaller @xmath37 , i.e. , some of the incoherent weight spreads to lower energies .",
    "inspite of these uncertainties , it is evident that @xmath2 does not exhibit saturation .    the experimental spectra by peets _",
    "et al._@xcite reveal two fairly clearly separated regions : a low - energy feature and a peak at about @xmath41  ev higher energy .",
    "it seems plausible therefore to associate the former with the doping - induced low - energy states and the latter with the upper hubbard band , in qualitative correspondence with the spectra shown in fig .  1 .",
    "since the lower peak has an intrinsic width of about 1  ev , it is clearly not possible to associate its spectral weight only with the much narrower pseudogap region .",
    "instead , this low - energy peak most likely covers all unoccupied states below the upper hubbard band .",
    "the fact that this peak saturates near @xmath12 in the experiment is therefore in conflict with the cluster dmft results for the single - band hubbard model shown in fig .",
    "according to the results provided in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the saturation obtained by phillips and jarrell@xcite appears to be related to the small , doping - independent energy .",
    "the integrated spectral weight of states induced in the mott gap of the two - dimensional single - band hubbard model via hole doping is examined within cluster dmft based on finite - temperature exact diagonalization .",
    "the doping variation of this weight is shown to depend sensitively on the energy window in which the low - energy states are counted . if the cutoff energy is chosen to vary with doping and to lie in the minimum below the upper hubbard band , qualitative agreement with model predictions by eskes _",
    "et al . _ is found . on the other hand ,",
    "if the cutoff energy is taken to be independent of doping , the integrated spectral weight exhibits a completely different variation with doping .",
    "in particular , at small cutoff energies , approximate saturation at low doping is found . since the xas data by peets _",
    "_ require integration over all unoccupied states except for the upper hubbard band , we conclude that these data are not compatible with present cluster dmft predictions for the single - band hubbard model ."
