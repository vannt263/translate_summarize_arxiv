    "rabi oscillations ( ro ) represent oscillating transitions of a two - level quantum system between its stationary states under the action of a synchronously oscillating field .",
    "the ro effect appears in the regime of the strong coupling of a quantum oscillator with the driving field , hence it can not be considered as a small perturbation .",
    "the effect was for the first time theoretically predicted by rabi [ 1 ] and experimentally observed by torrey [ 2 ] as a periodic change (  flip - flops \" ) of the orientation of a nuclear spin in the magnetic field , in the radiofrequency range .",
    "thereafter , ro were found in many other physical settings , such as electromagnetically driven atoms [ 3 ] , semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) [ 4 ] , semiconductor charge qubits [ 5 ] , spin qubits [ 6 ] , superconductive charge qubits based on josephson junctions [ 7 ] , etc . in particular , the interest to ro in different types of nanostructures is stipulated by potential applications to the design of elements of quantum logic and quantum memory .",
    "the significant role of local - field effects ( electron - hole dipole - dipole interactions ) in building coherent optical response of the qds , even in the weak - coupling regime , was predicted in refs .",
    "[ 8 - 11 ] . in particular , local fields induce a fine structure of the qd absorption - emission spectrum [ 10,11 ] .",
    "the local - field effects enhanced by the strong light - qd coupling manifest themselves in a number of observable modifications of the conventional ro picture .",
    "some of them , such as a bifurcation and essentially anharmonic ro regimes , were predicted in refs .",
    "[ 12,13 ] and thereafter experimentally observed in ref .",
    "[ 14 ] in quantum - well islands .",
    "the role of local fields in the formation of excitonic ro in self - assembling qds was experimentally studied in ref . [ 15 ] , using the two - pulse photon - echo spectroscopy . as a result",
    ", it has been concluded that local - field effects considerably contribute to the qd optical response in agreement with the theoretical estimations [ 11 - 13 ] .",
    "the analysis of the local - field effects should be based , in principle , on the general principles of the quantum many - body theory [ 16,17 ] . however , because a direct solution of this problem is practically impossible , different phenomenological interpretations of the local field in the qd and , respectively , different approximate ways for its theoretical description have been elaborated .",
    "one model ( scheme a , in terms of ref .",
    "[ 18 ] ) exploits the electrodynamic picture : a depolarization field is formed , making a difference between the local field inside the qd and the external acting field , due to the screening of the external field by the charges induced at qd boundaries . in this model ,",
    "the total electromagnetic field is not fully transverse , including a longitudinal component . in the alternative model ( scheme b in terms of ref . [ 18 ] ) , only the transverse component is associated with the electromagnetic field , while the longitudinal part is related to the electron - hole interactions . both approaches are equivalent and lead to identical results . in any case",
    ", the local fields should be introduced self - consistently , parallel to the consideration of the carrier motion . in the framework of single - particle models ,",
    "this can be done by means of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov approximation [ 19 ] . as a result ,",
    "specific nonlinear terms appear in the equations of electron - hole oscillations in the qd , invalidating the superposition principle .    in spatially extended systems , such as one - dimensional qd chains ,",
    "collective effects come into play .",
    "this leads to the spatial propagation of the ro in the form of plane waves and wave packets , as predicted in refs .",
    "[ 20 - 22 ] .",
    "the spatial walk of the quantum transitions is accompanied by the transfer of energy , quasimomentum , and electron - electron and electron - photon correlations . to simplify the description of this quantum transport",
    ", the discrete qd chain was modeled as an effective continuous medium [ 20 - 22 ] .",
    "two different cases may be distinguished with respect to the quantum structure of the incident field . in the first , semiclassical , case",
    ", the spatial structure of the classical external field follows the quantum motion of the particles , but light - matter interactions do not manifest themselves in the structure of the photonic field .",
    "thus , the electron - photon wave function is factorizable , and only its electronic part should be explicitly examined . as a result",
    ", the ro propagation is described by a linear system of two coupled schrdinger equations for complex envelope amplitudes of the ground- and excited - state probabilities [ 20 ] .",
    "the second case is a truly quantum one . in that case , the electron - photon exchange associated with the ro propagation process is accompanied by the transformation of the field distribution over @xmath0-photon states , leading to entanglement of the photon and electron states ( wave - like dressing of electrons by the radiation ) [ 21 ] . in the latter context , a promising potential application of the ro waves for the excitation of optical nanoantennas was proposed in ref .",
    "[ 22 ] .",
    "relevant to the study the propagation of the ro waves in various nanostructures is the analysis of their nonlinearity . the modern arsenal of nonlinear physics ( harmonic generation , self - action , multistability , solitons , _",
    "etc_. ) , can be applied to the ro waves in this context @xcite . due to the specific physical nature of these waves of quantum transitions",
    ", one may expect particular manifestations of the nonlinear effects .",
    "one of the nonlinearity mechanisms , as mentioned above , is based on the action of local fields .",
    "this , in particular , leads to the appearance of solitons and dynamical self - localized modes ( breathers ) .",
    "the construction of such discrete _ rabi solitons _ and _ rabi breathers _ in qd arrays is the aim of the present work . in this paper , we restrict the analysis to the semi - classical case , i.e. , the electromagnetic field is treated as a classical one , which is quite relevant for qd settings [ 20 ] .",
    "indeed , as , even on the nanoscale spatial dimensions and respective femtosecond temporal scales characteristic for these systems , quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic waves are negligible .",
    "the quantum description of the photonic field may be relevant for arrays of individual atoms or ions , rather than nanoparcticles ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the developed model amounts to a system of two coupled discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equations for the wave functions of the ground and excited states , with the nonlinearity represented solely by the cross - phase - modulation ( xpm ) terms , while the usual self - phase - modulation ( spm ) is absent .",
    "the system also includes the linear coupling between the two equations , cf .",
    "a novel essential feature of the system , which makes it different from the previously studied ones , is the phase shift between constants of the intersite hopping in the two components of the system .",
    "the shift is introduced , as a geometric phase , by an angle between the chain and the poynting vector of the electromagnetic field , which couples the ground and excited states of the two - level qds .",
    "dynamical modes in this system are studied by means of numerical methods , which reveal the existence of standing and moving rabi solitons and breathers .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the model and corresponding system of dnls equations are formulated , and their physical meaning is discussed in necessary detail . in sec .",
    "iii the results of the numerical analysis for single - soliton and double - soliton complexes are presented and conditions of their stability are reported .",
    "the paper is concluded by sec .",
    "as said above , we consider a chain of identical qds exposed to the classical light wave with the electric field at the @xmath1-th site of the chain presented as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the axial wavenumber , and @xmath4 the spacing of the qd chain .",
    "the qds are assumed to be identical two - level non - dissipative systems with energy distance @xmath5 between the excited and ground - state electron orbitals , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "adjacent qds are coupled through the electron tunneling ( hopping ) , so that only intraband transitions are taken into account [ 22 ] .",
    "we assume that the light interacts with the qd chain in the resonant regime , therefore the frequency detuning is small in comparison to both the optical and quantum - transition frequencies . following the rotating - wave - approximation @xcite , we eliminate rapidly oscillating terms in the equations of motion .",
    "these assumptions correspond to the ro model formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the raising , lowering , and population operators of the @xmath1-th qd are denoted as @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xmath11 , and @xmath12 @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding single - particle hamiltonian is @xmath14where the first term describes the qd under the action of the electromagnetic field without tunnel coupling to its neighbors , while the second one corresponds to the interdot coupling through the tunneling .",
    "these two terms were included into to the model introduced in ref . [ 22 ] .",

    "the depolarization tensor depends both on the qd configuration and the quantum state of the electron - hole pair:@xmath19where @xmath20 is the wave function of the electron - hole , and @xmath21 is the green tensor of the maxwell s equations in the quasi - static limit @xcite .",

    "similar to its counterpart in the berry phase @xcite , this is a geometric phase , but in the present one - dimensional setting it does not generate a topological state .",
    "values close to @xmath28 are reachable for surface waves with large retardation @xcite , while @xmath29 corresponds to the excitation of the array by the normally incident plane wave .",
    "further , @xmath30 is the qd - field coupling factor ( @xmath31 is the absolute value of the polarization vector with components @xmath16 ) , @xmath32 @xmath33 is the depolarization shift , @xmath34is the an independent detuning parameter , and @xmath35 are coefficients of the coupling between adjacent sites of the lattice .    these equations may be considered as the discrete version of equations that have been used in ref .

    "our objective in this work was to develop the theory for the interaction of the qd ( quantum  dot ) chain with classical light in the strong - coupling regime , which takes into account the local - field effect ( depolarization ) .",

    "we have introduced the periodic array of identical two - level qds , coupled via tunneling between neighboring dots .",
    "the system of equations of motion has been derived , which includes the tunneling and depolarization .",
    "the main conclusions produced by the analysis can be summarized as follows .",
    "\\(i ) the equations of motion have the form of two coupled dnls(discrete nonlinear schrdinger ) equations for probability amplitudes of the given qd ( lattice site ) to be found in the ground or excited state .",
    "there are two different mechanisms of coupling between the equations .",
    "the linear mechanism is stipulated by the  chain - light \" interaction , and manifests itself in the form of the ro ( rabi oscillations ) .",
    "the other coupling mechanism is based on the xpm nonlinear terms , which represent the action of the local fields .",
    "the constants of the intersite lattice coupling ( hopping ) are complex ones , whose phases , which are opposite in the two coupled dnls equations , are determined by the angle between the chain s axis and the direction of the incident electromagnetic wave .",
    "these intersite hopping coefficients , which are complex conjugate to each other in the two equations , represent a drastic difference of the present model from previously studied systems of coupled dnls equations .",
    "\\(ii ) the numerical analysis has demonstrated that ro waves in the qd chain , coupled to the co - propagating classical electromagnetic field , self - trap into stable onsite - centered fundamental _",
    "rabi solitons _ , while the intersite fundamental solitons are unstable , spontaneously transforming into onsite - centered robust _",
    "rabi breathers_. bound states of fundamental solitons are unstable in the stationary state , but they too readily transform themselves into robust breathers .",
    "the above - mentioned intersite hopping coefficients , which take complex conjugate in the coupled equations , affect the internal structure of the solitons , making them complex modes , but this novel feature does not destabilize the solitons .",
    "the detuning between the light and inter - level transition frequencies breaks the symmetry between the two components of the discrete solitons , but does not affect their stability either .",
    "mobility of the rabi solitons was investigated too .",
    "\\(iii ) the frequency spectrum of the stable rabi solitons features a single narrow line at the rabi frequency .",
    "the ro at this frequency do not manifest themselves in terms of observable quantities , serving for the stabilization of the solitons .",
    "the inversion of the stable rabi soliton [ @xmath53 , see eq .",
    "( w ) ] is exactly equal to zero .",
    "the frequency spectrum of electric current in the qd chain comprises a narrow line at the external field frequency , as well as the zero - frequency line corresponding to the dc current .",
    "the former frequency is produced by the displacement current due to the resonant quantum transitions , while the latter one is induced by the tunneling ( intersite hopping ) .",
    "\\(iv ) the frequency spectrum of the robust rabi breathers features an additional spectral line , which produces extra lines in the current spectra .",
    "the resonant line at the external - field frequency transforms into a triplet , while the dc current transforms into the low - frequency spectral component , which partially overlaps with the single resonance line .",
    "the low - frequency current component is induced by the asymmetry , which is determined by the direction of the light propagation relative to the qd chain .",
    "accordingly , the low - frequency component vanishes in the limit of the normal incidence .",
    "the theory presented in this paper does not account for relaxation mechanisms , the quantum structure of the incident light , and interaction of moving rabi - solitons with edges of the chain ( unless the chain is circular , and has no edges ) .",
    "these problems are of special interest and should be considered elsewhere ."
