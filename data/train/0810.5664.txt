    "<S> although @xmath0 modified gravity models can be made to satisfy solar system and cosmological constraints , it has been shown that they have the serious drawback of the nonexistence of stars with strong gravitational fields . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss whether or not higher curvature corrections can remedy the nonexistence consistently . </S>",
    "<S> the following problems are shown to arise as the costs one must pay for the @xmath0 models that allow for neutrons stars : ( i ) the leading correction must be fine - tuned to have the typical energy scale @xmath1 gev , which essentially comes from the free fall time of a relativistic star ; ( ii ) the leading correction must be further fine - tuned so that it is not given by the quadratic curvature term . </S>",
    "<S> the second problem is caused because there appears an intermediate curvature scale , and laboratory experiments of gravity will be under the influence of higher curvature corrections . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis thus implies that it is a challenge to construct viable @xmath0 models without very careful and unnatural fine - tuning . </S>"
