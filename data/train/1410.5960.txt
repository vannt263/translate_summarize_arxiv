    "<S> the most conspicuous property of a semiflexible polymer is its persistence length , defined as the decay length of tangent correlations along its contour . using an efficient stochastic growth algorithm to sample polymers embedded in a quenched two - dimensional hard - disk fluid </S>",
    "<S> , we find apparent wormlike chain statistics with a renormalized persistence length . </S>",
    "<S> we identify a universal form of the disorder renormalization that suggests itself as a quantitative measure of molecular crowding .    </S>",
    "<S> single - molecule experiments have established the wormlike chain ( wlc ) as a standard model for semiflexible biopolymers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it emerges from the classical heisenberg model for a ferromagnetic spin chain in the continuum limit , where the spins merge into an inextensible space curve @xmath0 and the exchange interaction between adjacent spins ( or unit tangent vectors @xmath1 ) turns into an energetic penalty for bending . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting continuum hamiltonian @xmath2 is also familiar from continuum mechanics as a model for a slender rod with bending rigidity @xmath3  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the wlc model accurately describes a very diverse range of polymers , including dna  @xcite , muscle protein  @xcite , filamentous actin  @xcite , as well as synthetic carbon nanotubes  @xcite .    exploiting the analogy of the wlc with the heisenberg magnet </S>",
    "<S> , it can be shown  @xcite that for an isolated wlc in @xmath4 dimensions , the equilibrium tangent - tangent correlation function decays exponentially , @xmath5 and thus defines a _ thermal _ persistence length @xmath6    the analytically solvable case of a single polymer in isolation maps well to single - molecule experiments but bears little resemblance to the disordered environment provided by a surrounding polymer network or even the cytoplasm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although much work has been done on both local  @xcite and global  @xcite properties of semiflexible polymers in disorder , it remains unknown just how much of the wlc survives in the presence of a disordered environment . </S>",
    "<S> the exponentially decaying tangent - tangent correlation function in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> might for example turn into some nonexponential function of @xmath7 , or it might remain exponential and thus define a _ </S>",
    "<S> renormalized _ persistence length , which then may or may not agree with its thermal value , given by eq .  . in the last case </S>",
    "<S> , one can imagine that the persistence length increases ( due to channel formation  @xcite ) or decreases ( due to crumpling induced by the obstacles ) with respect to its thermal value .    </S>",
    "<S> for an isolated wlc , the exponential decay described by eq .   derives from a random walk in tangent space , which is most easily visualized by imagining a thermal ensemble of polymers with one of their ends held clamped along a given direction . </S>",
    "<S> their free ends will then point along the same direction if the polymers are very short , but stray away from it diffusively if the polymers are longer . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , if the same ensemble is exposed to a quenched random background that is in some regions more favorable than in others , the free polymer ends will naturally gravitate towards the more favorable regions . </S>",
    "<S> it has long been established that this can give rise to a superdiffusive growth of transverse fluctuations for directed polymers in random media  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent results by boltz and kierfeld show that it can also give rise to a superdiffusive growth of tangent fluctuations for stiff semiflexible polymers exposed to @xmath8-correlated quenched gaussian disorder  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a superdiffusive growth of tangent fluctuations translates to a faster decay of tangent - tangent correlations compared to an isolated wlc , which on a scaling level can be captured by an `` effective disorder - induced persistence length ''  @xcite that is smaller than the thermal value eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> it also translates , however , to a tangent - tangent correlation function decaying faster than exponentially , and thus does not define a persistence length in the strict sense of eq .  .    </S>",
    "<S> to find out whether a renormalized persistence length in the strong sense of eq .   </S>",
    "<S> might be observed under more realistic conditions , we have performed extensive numerical simulations of two - dimensional semiflexible polymers in a quenched equilibrium hard - disk fluid . as we demonstrate below , this disorder - averaged ensemble of test polymers </S>",
    "<S> indeed exhibits a renormalized persistence length in the strong sense , which can account also for the dominant effect of the crowding onto the polymer end - to - end distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that even if a shape analysis of microscopic _ in vivo _ imagery seems to agree perfectly well with standard wlc results , the persistence length inferred from the data may deviate significantly from the polymer s thermal persistence length that obeys eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> for sufficiently stiff polymers , we find that the renormalized persistence length can be determined uniquely from the thermal persistence length and an auxiliary quantity that characterizes the disordered environment . this feature , which is known to hold true in the double asymptotic limit of high stiffness and @xmath8-correlated gaussian disorder  @xcite , but to our knowledge never has been observed in a more realistic setting , opens a novel way to employ polymers of known stiffness as quantitative probes of molecular crowding .    </S>",
    "<S> our simulations are based on the discrete representation of the polymer , which is constrained to lie in a plane ( @xmath9 ) . the discrete ( heisenberg ) and continuum ( wlc ) </S>",

    "<S> , the thermal persistence length @xmath18 . in the following , we subject the polymer to a random , quenched and statistically isotropic background potential @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to earlier analytical works on the subject  @xcite we are free to do away with the simplifying assumptions of a vanishing correlation length or a gaussian distribution of potential energies ; instead we adhere closely to the spirit of molecular crowding by assuming sterically interacting obstacles that are small compared to the polymer , but still large on the monomer scale . as a paradigmatic representative of steric disorder </S>",
    "<S> , we consider an equilibrated ( but quenched with respect to the polymer ) hard - disk fluid at several area filling fractions @xmath20 , ranging from @xmath21 to the verge of the freezing transition at @xmath22  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath19 takes the values @xmath23 or @xmath24 , depending on whether the polymer penetrates any of the disks or not . since in an unbounded quenched system the polymer as a whole will gravitate towards ever more favorable regions  @xcite , thus in our case producing a trivial ensemble of straight rods in the limit of large persistence lengths and infinitely large systems , we eliminate the dependence on system volume by fixing one polymer end at the origin , @xmath25 , which one might think of as a membrane - bound anchor point in the context of biopolymers in cells .    </S>",
    "<S> the extreme strength and density of environmental interactions present a formidable challenge to conventional monte carlo simulation schemes , which we found hard to overcome even using a sophisticated multicanonical histogram reweighting procedure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have therefore adopted a breadth - first growth algorithm  @xcite that resolves this difficulty by _ circumventing _ energy barriers instead of trying to cross them  @xcite . for a given disorder realization , </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm starts with an ensemble of monomers fixed at the origin and then performs @xmath26 successive growth steps to extend each ensemble member to a polymer of the desired length . during each growth step , every polymer in the ensemble branches out into a small set of new trial configurations through the addition of monomers pointing in random directions . </S>",
    "<S> this incurs a severalfold increase of the ensemble population . </S>",
    "<S> next , the boltzmann weight of each new trial configuration is calculated . </S>",
    "<S> each trial configuration is then either eliminated or replicated probabilistically , such that ( i ) the overall ensemble population is held approximately constant to prevent memory and processing time requirements from growing exponentially and ( ii ) the occurrence probability of any given configuration agrees with its equilibrium probability @xmath27)$ ] , thus establishing thermal equilibrium after each growth step .         </S>",

    "<S> @xcite would require us to further extend @xmath37 beyond the limits of current numerical methods . </S>",
    "<S> this does not diminish the relevance of our results to biophysical experiments , where polymer lengths typically do not vary over several orders of magnitude . ] . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath37 in our simulations is comparable to the thermal persistence length @xmath32 , and several times larger than the obstacle size , these contour lengths should closely approximate typical experimental conditions in cell biophysics .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed exponential scaling of tangent - tangent correlations implies that the renormalized persistence length @xmath28 still derives from a diffusion process in tangent space ( as for a free wlc ) , albeit with a renormalized diffusivity . </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to note at this point that our model system exhibits , in the limit of vanishing obstacle size @xmath50 and diverging persistence length @xmath51 , the so - called _ tilt symmetry _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it causes the disorder - averaged angular fluctuations to separate into an unperturbed , `` thermal '' part and a disorder - induced part . </S>",
    "<S> together with the observed @xmath37-independent persistence length renormalization , we thus find the asymptotic relation @xmath52 which defines a `` disorder persistence length '' @xmath53 that should converge onto a @xmath32-independent master curve , in the limit @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction is in fact well supported by our data , despite the finite size of the obstacles ; see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : renormalized - persistence - length ] ( bottom ) . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , we can even rationalize the form of this master curve , on a scaling level . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the pure disorder effect onto the polymer conformation may simply be represented as a succession of @xmath36-sized deflections , separated by some distance @xmath54 that roughly corresponds to the `` mean free path '' between subsequent polymer - obstacle collisions . </S>",
    "<S> each real - space deflection of size @xmath36 amounts to a rotation @xmath55 in tangent space , hence giving rise to a disorder persistence length @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the mean free path @xmath54 should scale with @xmath57 at small disorder densities and approach a value on the order of @xmath36 at hexagonal close packing , @xmath58 . </S>",

    "<S> note that both @xmath64 and @xmath65 can be determined experimentally , so that @xmath66 provides a practical quantitative measure of the environmental disorder strength . </S>",
    "<S> equation   and possible refinements for polydisperse obstacle sizes , might thus prove useful in future attempts to quantify cellular crowding in terms of the density and size ( distribution ) of the steric obstacles .    </S>",
    "<S> although effective semiflexibility re - emerges on the global level of tangent correlations , more localized observables must bear witness to the presence of disorder correlations , allowing one to distinguish experimentally between `` true '' and `` renormalized '' semiflexibility , and providing further information on the nature of the obstacles and their correlations . here , we discuss the disorder - averaged radial distribution function , @xmath67 as an important example of such more local observables .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : radialdistributions ] , @xmath72 picks up the fluid structure of the background , as the ensemble branches out inside the more expansive voids and circumvents denser regions . to a first approximation , @xmath68 factorizes into two contributions : the free wlc radial distribution  @xcite with the renormalized persistence length @xmath28 and a factor weighing the relative abundance of void space at a given distance @xmath73 . as demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : radialdistributions ] , the latter is well represented by the `` void space distribution function '' , @xmath74 a close cousin to the radial distribution function known from liquid - state theory .    </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the molecular crowding in the cytoplasm of cells will crumple embedded cytoskeletal polymers . </S>",
    "<S> although we are not the first to predict that a quenched disordered background should induce a renormalized persistence length  @xcite , we were able to show explicitly that tangent correlations remain exponential , even at the highest filling fractions and for finite obstacle size . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the common practice of performing a static shape analysis of single fluorescently labeled polymers _ in vivo _ or in _ in - vitro _ reconstituted polymer solutions and networks requires special caution . </S>",
    "<S> it may not yield a reliable estimator of intrinsic polymer stiffness , even if its results look deceptively consistent with the wlc model . in spite of the modest size difference between the polymer length and the range of background correlations </S>",
    "<S> , we found that , for sufficiently stiff test polymers , the renormalized persistence length is uniquely determined in terms of the thermal persistence length @xmath32 and a `` disorder persistence length '' @xmath75 that characterizes the ambient disorder . on this basis </S>",
    "<S> , polymers of known intrinsic stiffness can be used as generic quantitative probes of molecular crowding . with our simple formula for the renormalized persistence length , </S>",
    "<S> their tangent correlations and radial distribution are conveniently analyzed in terms of the background disorder parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> it is an intriguing question whether our findings generalize to three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we assume they do , at least for generic kinds of disorder such as a random distribution of spheres or bent rods : neither the concept of tilt symmetry nor the idea of random polymer - obstacle collisions are specific to two dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> our `` disorder persistence length '' has a simple definition and could in principle be measured using standard video microscopy techniques analyzed in the usual way ( by measuring tangent - tangent correlations and radial distribution functions ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we hope to inspire not only further numerical or analytical work on the matter , but also experimental studies under physiological conditions . in this context , it would also be interesting to extend our analysis to the case of annealed disorder , which has recently been addressed experimentally for flexible polymers  @xcite . </S>"
