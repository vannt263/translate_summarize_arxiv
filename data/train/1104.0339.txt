    "the study of some discrete integrable systems , taking the form of recursion relations , i.e. evolution equations in a discrete time @xmath2 with suitable conservation laws , has recently shed some new light @xcite on the positivity conjecture of cluster algebras @xcite .",
    "indeed , admissible sets of initial data for such systems are particular clusters in some specific , non - finite type cluster algebras , whereas cluster mutations are implemented by the update of initial data via local application of the evolution equation . the positivity conjecture for cluster algebras then boils down to the following property : the solutions of such systems are _ laurent polynomials with non - negative integer coefficients _ of any of their admissible initial data .    in @xcite , this was proved for the so - called @xmath1-system for @xmath0 , by expressing solutions as partition functions for weighted paths on some target graphs , the weights being explicit laurent monomials of initial data .",
    "an extremely useful tool for such representations is the notion of ( multiply branching ) continued fraction .",
    "we were able to prove that mutations of initial data are implemented by local rearrangement of the continued fraction expressions for the generating series of fundamental solutions of the @xmath1-system .",
    "this was then extended to the so - called @xmath3-systems in @xcite for initial data forming periodic stepped surfaces , and finally to the most general initial data in @xcite , by use of a manifestly positive network path formulation . in all these cases",
    ", positivity follows from a form of discrete path integral representation of the solutions .",
    "the cluster algebra structure has a natural quantum version @xcite , in which cluster variables obey quantum commutation relations within each cluster .",
    "this led to the natural definition of quantum @xmath1-systems @xcite . in an analogous spirit , it was shown in @xcite that the @xmath3-system may be viewed as a @xmath1-system , involving non - commutative ( time - ordered ) variables .",
    "an even broader non - commutative version is known for the fully non - commutative @xmath4 @xmath1-system , for which laurent positivity was conjectured by m. kontsevich , and subsequently proved in @xcite .",
    "the latter proof relies on an extension of the previous path formulations to paths with non - commutative step weights : the partition function of such paths is the sum over paths of the product of step weights taken in the same order as the steps are taken . in @xcite ,",
    "such paths were used to investigate non - commutative versions of the @xmath1-systems . in particular , a compact formulation in terms of non - commutative continued fractions was obtained .    except in very specific cases ,",
    "very few explicit expressions of cluster variables in terms of fundamental data are known .",
    "for the ( classical ) @xmath0 @xmath1-system , such expressions were derived in @xcite for the generating series of its fundamental solutions .",
    "the aim of this note is to generalize these expressions for the generating series of the fundamental solutions of the quantum @xmath0 @xmath1-system , by using the non - commutative continued fraction expressions of @xcite .",
    "the results are summarized in our main theorem [ toe ] below , which expresses these generating functions for any admissible initial data as explicit series with coefficients that are laurent polynomials with coefficients in @xmath5 $ ] , where @xmath6 is the parameter of the quantum deformation .",
