    "sophisticated solutions have been studied for future cellular systems aiming at improving both the uplink and downlink data rates . for instance , introducing multiple antennas at both base stations ( bss ) and mobile stations ( mss ) greatly increases the achievable rates @xcite .",
    "furthermore , employing relays in these systems extends the coverage and enhances the performance @xcite . however , interference is still the main performance limiting factor in cellular systems .",
    "the transmission rate , especially when the mss are located at the cell edges , is greatly influenced by the inter - cell interferences .",
    "for instance for a cell edge ms , the received interference signal in the downlink can be severe and even of a comparable strength as the useful signal , which degrades the achieved rate significantly . to enhance the performance in cellular systems , smart spatial signal processing techniques at the bss and the mss , and also at the relays if they are employed in the system , need to be found .",
    "apart from joint processing techniques which require data exchange among the cooperating parties , we focus on distributed signal processing techniques which require only the exchange of channel state information .    before discussing the sum rate ,",
    "we first briefly review two interference reduction techniques which have been studied extensively , i.e. , interference alignment ( ia ) and sum mean square error ( mse ) minimization .",
    "ia is achieved by aligning all the interferences in a smaller subspace of the received signal space while keeping the useful signal subspace interference free @xcite .",
    "ia has received great attention in the last few years @xcite . basically , the ia problem has the nice property that it is a multi - affine problem .",
    "therefore , it can be tackled by alternatively solving several linear subproblems @xcite . for instance , the ia problem is a tri - affine problem if relays are employed .",
    "firstly , the filters of the bss are optimized with fixed relay processing matrices and fixed filters at the mss .",
    "secondly , the relay processing matrices are optimized with fixed filters at the bss and mss . at the third step",
    ", the filters of the mss are optimized with fixed filters at the bss and fixed relay processing matrices . however , since ia ignores the received noise , it performs poorly at low and moderate signal to noise ratios ( snrs ) @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "optimizing the spatial filters at the bss and the mss , as well as the processing matrices at the relays if they are employed , for minimizing the sum mse always achieves a compromise between interference reduction and noise reduction . in general , the sum mse is not a convex function .",
    "however , it is a convex function of either the filters at the bs , the filters at the mss or the relay processing matrices alone .",
    "this multi - convex structure of the sum mse function also allows alternating minimization algorithms to achieve a local minimum @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , minimizing the sum mse does not necessarily imply achieving the maximum sum rate .",
    "furthermore , it is worth to mention here that minimizing the sum bit error rate ( ber ) is an alternative objective to minimizing the sum mse @xcite .",
    "however , it is complicated to optimize the sum ber in multi - user multi - antenna scenarios as the ber has no closed form solution .    besides the techniques mentioned above , directly maximizing",
    "the sum rate is a promising goal for efficiently utilizing the limited available system resources @xcite .",
    "if the interference is treated as noise and some power constraints are considered , the sum rate maximization problem is a non - convex optimization problem @xcite .",
    "this non - convexity of the sum rate maximization problem holds even if we optimize over either the filters at the bss only , the filters at the mss only or the relay processing matrices only .",
    "therefore , iterative alternating optimization algorithms can not be directly implemented here .    in the last decade , a lot of progress has been made in finding efficient sum rate maximization algorithms .",
    "algorithms from global optimization theory are proposed for finding the global maximum of the sum rate @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , these algorithms suffer from high computational complexity which limits their practicality to small scenarios only .",
    "unlike the computationally expensive global optimization algorithms , relatively low complexity suboptimum algorithms have also received great attention .",
    "basically , the special structure of the sum rate function can be exploited to achieve a near optimum sum rate . in @xcite ,",
    "an interference broadcast channel is considered .",
    "instead of maximizing the sum rate , the authors maximizes the product of the snrs at the mss . rather than optimizing the filters at the bs and the mss all together",
    ", it is shown that the problem can be simplified to three subproblems , which are not necessarily convex .",
    "each subproblem aims at optimizing either the transmit powers , the bs filters or the ms filters .",
    "geometric programming is employed for approximating the solution of the non - convex subproblems . in @xcite ,",
    "some auxiliary variables are used to simplify the sum rate maximization problem in a broadcast channel .",
    "the authors introduce new variables to the problem such that the multiple constraints can be equivalently written as a single constraint .",
    "the sum rate function can be written as a difference of two concave functions @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the authors of @xcite linearly relax the second term and solve the resulting problem iteratively .",
    "some authors also exploit the minimized mse to maximize the sum rate . from the information theory perspective ,",
    "_ _ al . _ have found that there is a linear relationship between the derivative of the mutual information and the minimum mse for gaussian channels @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is shown in @xcite that this relationship holds for any wireless system with linear filters . considering a broadcast channel scenario ,",
    "the relationship between the derivative of the mutual information and the minimum mse can be exploited by designing the receive filters such that the mse at the receivers is minimized . in this case",
    ", the mse will be a function of the transmit filters @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the sum rate maximization problem for optimizing the transmit filters can be formulated as a minimization of the sum of log - mses .",
    "an approximate solution of this new formulation is found using geometric programming @xcite . designing the receive filters to minimize the mse and optimizing the remaining variables to maximize the sum rate",
    "is also considered in @xcite .",
    "it is shown that by relaxing the sum rate maximization problem and adding some auxiliary variables , a successive convex approximation approach can be applied @xcite .",
    "because of the problem relaxations , this approach does not converge to neither a local maximum nor the global maximum of the original problem . for a broadcast channel scenario ,",
    "the receive filters are designed aiming at minimizing the mse and by adding some auxiliary variables , the sum rate maximization problem is reformulated as a biconvex optimization problem of the transmit filter and the added auxiliary variables @xcite .",
    "this work is extended to many different scenarios such as mimo interference channels @xcite , interfering broadcast channels @xcite , and relay interference channels @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of this approach is that the receive filters are not optimized to maximize the sum rate .    in the present paper ,",
    "we aim at formulating the sum rate maximization problem as a multi - convex problem so that it can be efficiently solved by low complexity iterative algorithms .",
    "we specifically consider the downlink transmission in a cellular scenario with bss serving multiple mss , although the same approach can be applied to the uplink transmission as well .",
    "the transmission from the bss to the mss takes place either through several non - regenerative relays or directly without relays .",
    "first , we focus on describing our approach for a two - hop transmission scheme where relays are employed .",
    "then , we show that the approach can also be applied to other wireless systems by taking the single - hop transmission scheme without relays as an example .",
    "the key idea of our approach is to replace the signal to interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) at a ms by a new term whose maximal value is found to be 1+sinr . using this new term",
    ", we formulate a multi - concave objective function .",
    "we will show that this objective function has the same maxima as the sum rate function and , therefore , maximizing this objective function is equivalent to maximizing the sum rate function .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "a two - hop transmission scenario and a single - hop transmission scenario are described . in section [ sec:5 ] ,",
    "the two - hop transmission is first investigated and based on it , the multi - convex formulation of the sum rate is derived .",
    "an iterative sum rate maximization algorithm is proposed in section [ sec:5.5 ] . to show that our idea is quite general and fits in many scenarios , we derive the multi - convex problem formulation for the single - hop transmission in section [ sec:6 ] .",
    "a few additional aspects are discussed in section [ sec : disc ] and the performance of the proposed algorithm is shown in section [ sec:7 ] . in section [ sec:8 ] ,",
    "the conclusions are drawn .",
    "in this paper , we will consider two related scenarios , i.e. , a two - hop interference broadcast scenario and a single - hop interference broadcast scenario .",
    "the former will be described here , and the latter will be described in section [ sec:2.2 ] .    a downlink cellular scenario consisting of @xmath0 cells is considered .",
    "each cell contains a bs with @xmath1 antennas , and @xmath2 mss with @xmath3 antennas each .",
    "we first assume that the direct channels between the bss and the mss are relatively weak due to the radio environment so that they can be neglected . to enable the communication between the bss and the mss , @xmath4 half - duplex relays with @xmath5 antennas",

    "the channels between the communication parties are assumed to remain constant during the transmission . to simplify the discussions",
    ", we assume that each ms receives a single desired data symbol from the corresponding bs .",
    "accordingly , each bs transmits simultaneously @xmath2 complex valued data symbols with @xmath6 .",

    "the key idea of the algorithm proposed in this paper is to find a multi - concave objective function which is equivalent to the sum rate function in the sense that they have the same maxima , e.g. , the function @xmath110 in ( [ eq : obj2.2 ] ) and the function @xmath155 in ( [ eq : obj5.2 ] ) .",
    "it can be observed from the analysis in the previous sections that the new objective function must be a multi - concave function of the system variables as long as the function @xmath156 described in ( [ eq : g_fun ] ) is a multi - convex function .",
    "this however only requires that each estimated data symbol @xmath65 is a multi - affine function of the system variables .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that for a system in which the estimated data symbols are multi - affine functions of the system variables , the sum rate maximization problem can be equivalently formulated as a multi - convex optimization problem .    in this paper",
    ", we only considered the case where each ms receives a single desired data symbol from the corresponding bs . if more than one data symbol is desired by each ms , one can expect that the estimated data symbols at a ms are superposed by colored noise .",
    "therefore , a pre - whitening filter is required at each ms to decorrelate the noise signals , which results in that the estimated data symbols are no longer multi - affine functions of the system variables . however",
    ", if this correlation among the noise signals is ignored and the received data symbols are decoded symbol - wise , an approximate sum rate can still be maximized using the proposed algorithm .",
    "in the following simulation results , the performance of the proposed sum rate maximization algorithm is evaluated in a cellular scenario with @xmath157 cells , @xmath158 mss per cell , @xmath159 antennas at each bs , @xmath160 relays , and @xmath161 antennas at each relay and ms . the two - hop transmission scheme is applied . concerning the channel model , we employ an i.i.d . complex gaussian channel model with the average channel gain being normalized to one . to assess the performance of our proposed algorithm , two reference schemes are considered .",
    "firstly , an ia algorithm is considered where the tuple @xmath66 of the transmit filters , the tuple @xmath78 of the receive filters , and the tuple @xmath67 of the relay processing matrices are alternatingly optimized to minimize the total interference leakage in the system .",
    "the considered ia algorithm is a direct extension of the interference leakage minimization algorithm proposed in @xcite to a multiuser relay scenario .",
    "the second reference scheme is the sum mse minimization algorithm which minimizes the sum mse by alternatingly optimizing @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "[ c][c]sum rate in bits@xmath162channel use [ ct][ct]@xmath163 in db [ rb][rb]sum rate max .",

    "[ rb][rb]ia   in decibel for a scenario with @xmath157 , @xmath164 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ] +    firstly , the achieved sum rate per time slot is considered as a performance measure .",
    "the performance of the proposed algorithm is considered as a function of the pseudo snr which is defined as the ratio of the sum transmit power of all the bss and relays to the noise variance @xmath36 , i.e. , @xmath165 figure [ fig : result ] shows the performances of the three considered algorithms averaged over many different channel snapshots .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] that the ia algorithm performs poorly as compared to the other two algorithms at low to moderate pseudo snrs . on the one hand",
    ", the ia algorithm does not consider noise reduction . on the other hand",
    ", the ia algorithm does not intend to improve the received powers of the useful signals when minimizing the interferences .",
    "that is to say , the ia algorithm does not maximize the received snrs at the mss . in the pseudo snr region shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] , both the sum mse minimization and the sum rate maximization algorithms achieve superior performance as compared to the ia algorithm .",
    "however , the sum rate maximization algorithm outperforms the sum mse minimization algorithm on average .",
    "this shows that minimizing the sum mse does not necessarily achieve high sum rates . at high pseudo snrs ,",
    "interferences become more harmful . as ia aims at perfectly nullifying all the interferences ,",
    "the sum rates achieved by the ia algorithm increase approximately linearly with the pseudo snrs and the slope is related to the achieved degrees of freedom ( dofs ) .",
    "furthermore , if the sum mse minimization and the sum rate maximization algorithms are able to find the global optima , all three curves should have the same slope at high pseudo snrs .",
    "however , as the total available power increases , the feasible region described by the constraint sets of ( [ eq : con1.1 ] ) and ( [ eq : con1.2 ] ) enlarges and this complicates the search for a good local optimum for both the sum mse minimization and the sum rate maximization algorithms . as a result , both algorithms can not achieve the same dofs as the ia algorithm .",

    "[ fig : distribution ] , the approximated probability density of the sum rates achieved by the proposed sum rate maximization algorithm , the sum mse minimization algorithm , and the ia algorithm at a pseudo snr of @xmath166 are shown .",
    "one can observe that the ia algorithm sometimes achieves a high sum rate but the average performance remains low .",
    "this implies that the snr at each ms may vary across a wide range depending on the channel realization .",
    "the performance of the sum mse minimization algorithm is more stable than that of the ia algorithm because the received useful signal powers are forced close to the transmit signal powers , i.e. , the gains of the useful links are close to one .",
    "finally , the proposed sum rate maximization algorithm achieves the highest average sum rate with the smallest variance among the three considered algorithms in this case . for a randomly given channel realization",
    ", the algorithm converges , with high probability , to a solution which achieves a sum rate in the range between @xmath167 bits per channel use and @xmath168 bits per channel use .",
    "however , for some channel realizations , the algorithm may also converge to solutions achieving a sum rate of about @xmath169 bits per channel use or @xmath170 bits per channel use .",
    "the reason is that the sum rate maximization algorithm is not guaranteed to achieve a global maximum .",
    "if the auxiliary variables @xmath115 and @xmath109 are fixed , the optimization problem of ( [ eq : obj6])([eq : con6.2 ] ) is similar to a weighted sum mse minimization problem . how to find the global optimum for such a problem is still an open question",
    ". in fact , alternatingly adapting the sets of optimization variables may result in that one or several users are turned off . in our simulation results for instance",
    ", it may happen that zero , one , or even two of the six mss are turned off depending on the pseudo snr and the channel realizations . because of this , the ia algorithm can even outperform the proposed sum rate maximization algorithm at very high pseudo snrs .",

    "since reducing interferences does not guarantee an increment of the sum rate , the sum rate achieved by the ia algorithm converges .",
    "the average sum rate achieved by the sum mse minimization algorithm slowly increases with the number of iterations . as",
    "compared to the sum mse algorithm , the proposed sum rate maximization algorithm not only converges faster but also converges to a higher sum rate on average .",
    "the main reason is that the auxiliary variables @xmath115 and @xmath109 are adapted in every iteration to help maximizing the sum rate .",
    "furthermore , since these auxiliary variables can be calculated in closed form , our sum rate maximization algorithm is comparable with the sum mse minimization algorithms in terms of its computational complexity , which is mainly determined by the quadratic optimization tools used for optimizing the transmit filters at the bss and the relay processing matrices .",
    "in this paper , the sum rate maximization problem in cellular networks is considered .",
    "it is shown that by adding two sets of auxiliary variables , this problem can be formulated as a multi - convex optimization problem .",
