    "since the advent of laser cooling of neutral atoms more than 20 years ago , this method has been extensively studied @xcite and widely used for a variety of atoms and applications .",

    "after sub - doppler molasses cooling @xcite and polarization of the sample by optical pumping , the atoms are typically transferred into a magnetic trap @xcite or , as has been recently demonstrated , into an optical @xcite trap .",
    "the consecutive evaporative cooling process requires both , a high initial density to provide a reasonably large elastic collision rate , and a large number of atoms , since most atoms are removed from the trap during evaporation .",
    "the figure of merit for efficient evaporative cooling is the initial phase space density of the atomic cloud .",
    "therefore , all laser cooling and polarization steps have to be optimized carefully , to keep the temperature of the atoms low and the number of atoms high , thus maximizing the phase space density in the final trap .    in this paper",
    ", we present a robust doppler cooling scheme in an external trap which is applicable to most laser - coolable atomic species .",
    "our scheme is particularly well suited for optically dense samples and reduces the figure of merit for evaporative cooling to the number of atoms transferred into the trap regardless of temperature .",
    "free - space one - dimensional doppler cooling is usually performed in a standing wave light field created by two counterpropagating laser beams with a frequency below the atomic transition frequency .",
    "cooling is based on preferential absorption of photons from the laser beam opposing the direction of motion of the atom .",
    "subsequent spontaneous emission is centrally symmetric and does not change the mean momentum of the atom .",
    "doppler cooling of polarized atoms in a magnetic trap has been proposed for atomic hydrogen @xcite and experimentally realized for sodium @xcite , hydrogen @xcite and lithium @xcite . in ref .",
    "one - dimensional doppler cooling of an optically thin cloud of sodium atoms in a magnetic trap was performed .",
    "the atoms were treated as a two level system since a very high magnetic offset field ( @xmath0  g ) spectroscopically resolved the zeeman substates .",
    "cooling of the motional degrees of freedom orthogonal to the laser beams was provided by anharmonic mixing in the trapping potential . due to a long mixing time",
    "compared to the cooling time , the achieved temperature was ten times the doppler temperature for sodium . in ref .",
    "single - beam pulsed doppler cooling was performed on a dense sample of magnetically trapped hydrogen atoms .",
    "thermalization of the cloud was accomplished by elastic collisions between the atoms .",
    "cooling was limited to approx .",
    "five times the doppler temperature due to limited laser power and additional heating rates .",
    "the main advantage of the cooling technique presented here is that it combines three - dimensional temperatures close to the doppler - limit with the cooling of dense samples . in our experiment ,",
    "one - dimensional optical molasses cools the cloud of atoms in axial direction down to the doppler limit @xcite . cooling in the radial directions , orthogonal to the laser beams ,",
    "can be explained by reabsorption of spontaneously emitted photons by the optically dense cloud . to our knowledge ,",
    "reabsorption has so far been treated only as a density - limiting mechanism which comes along with heating of the atomic sample @xcite . here ,",
    "we focus on the cooling aspects of scattered and reabsorbed photons in a trapped polarized atomic sample .",
    "we show that the atoms in the magnetic trap remain polarized during the cooling process and practically no atoms are lost , provided the magnetic substructure is spectrally resolved .",
    "we are able to cool chromium atoms in a magnetic trap from @xmath1  mk to a mean temperature of @xmath2k , corresponding to an increase in phase space density by a factor of 80 .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of the cooling process as well as the steady state temperature for various cooling parameters .",
    "the experimental results can be explained with a simple model based on rate equations for the temperature .",

    "we conclude with a discussion of our results in sec .",
    "in this section , we present a simple model based on rate equations .",
    "although we assume cooling in a magnetic trap here , the scheme is universal to all kinds of traps , provided cooling is compatible with the trap and the quantization axis of the atoms is independent of the position of the atoms in the trap .    consider a cloud of spin - polarized atoms with mass @xmath3 and magnetic moment @xmath4 confined in an axially symmetric harmonic magnetic trap with trapping potential @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 are the magnetic field curvatures in radial ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) and axial ( @xmath9 ) direction , respectively , and @xmath10 is a homogeneous offset field along the axial direction .",
    "we assume that the corresponding trap frequencies @xmath11 are much smaller than the larmor precession frequency at the center of the trap @xmath12 , ensuring that the atoms stay spin polarized and no spin flip losses occur @xcite .    doppler cooling is performed on an electric dipole transition that couples a long - lived ground state with total angular momentum @xmath13 to a short - lived excited state with angular momentum @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "we also assume the corresponding land factors @xmath16 and @xmath17 to have the same sign , which we choose to be positive for our example .",
    "the atoms are polarized in the `` weak field seeking '' state @xmath18 and have a magnetic moment of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is bohr s magneton .",

    "in general , the quality of the polarization of the cooling light is important .",
    "for perfectly polarized @xmath26-light propagating along the quantization axis of the atoms in a homogeneous magnetic field , no depolarizing transitions @xmath27 can occur .",
    "this is also true for excitation by scattered photons since the polarization with respect to the quantization axis of the incident light is preserved in the scattering process if the propagation direction coincides with the orientation of the magnetic field . for imperfect polarization ,",
    "the cooling light can also drive depolarizing transitions which cause loss of atoms . in the configuration described above , the zeeman - splitting due to the finite offset field",
    "@xmath28 additionally reduces the scattering rates @xmath29 of unwanted depolarizing transitions with respect to the rate @xmath30 of the cooling transition @xmath31 : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the effective detunings between the laser and the atomic transition frequency in a magnetic field and @xmath35 is the square of the clebsch - gordan coefficient for the transition from state @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",

    "assuming a polarization quality of 1:10 , a detuning of @xmath47 for the polarizing transition and allowing for an atom loss of less than 1% during the cooling process , we find for the case of chromium a necessary offset field of @xmath48  g and for rubidium @xmath49  g.    following the common treatment of free - space doppler cooling @xcite , rate equations for the temporal evolution of the temperature for the axial ( @xmath9 ) and radial ( @xmath8 ) degrees of freedom are readily obtained : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the recoil energy of the cooling transition with wavenumber @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "usually , the heating and cooling time constants are derived by considering the random walk in momentum space due to spontaneous emission and the net cooling effect of scattered photons from the two counterpropagating laser beams @xcite . in an optically dense sample reabsorption of photons has to be taken into account .",
    "previously , reabsorption has mainly been discussed as a reason for density limitations and density - dependent heating in magneto - optical traps @xcite and in the context of sub - recoil cooling @xcite . in our model",
    ", we emphasize cooling effects of reabsorbed photons which can be substantial for polarized atoms confined in an external trapping potential .",
    "the photon energy after a scattering event in the low intensity limit @xcite is shifted by at most @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the velocity of an atom at doppler temperature .",
    "therefore scattered photons have essentially the same detuning and polarization as the cooling laser beams . for our calculations",
    ", we use the axial direction parallel to the laser beam as our quantization axis .",
    "the contribution of the reabsorbed photons to cooling of the radial and axial directions depends on the projection of their wave vector @xmath56 onto these directions .",
    "the effective intensity @xmath57 of the cooling photons is proportional to the incident laser light intensity @xmath58 with a proportionality factor @xmath59 which primarily depends on the optical density @xmath60 in these directions : @xmath61 if we consider a dipole radiation and absorption pattern for @xmath62-polarized light and take into account the @xmath63 size @xmath64 of a gaussian shaped cloud in the direction given by @xmath65 , we arrive at the following expressions : @xmath66 @xmath67 is an angle - independent constant , with peak density @xmath68 and resonant absorption cross section @xmath69 which we assume to be uniform over the cloud . in a simple picture ,",
    "@xmath59 can be interpreted as the effective number of photons that contribute to cooling in the corresponding directions originating from a single photon absorbed from the laser light .",
    "the total number of reabsorption / emission cycles for an incident photon is given by @xmath70 if the effects of reabsorbed photons are included the cooling rates become @xcite @xmath71 in axial and radial direction the total cooling light intensity reads @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "for the derivation of the heating rates , we have to take into account directed reabsorption of @xmath59 photons and spontaneous emission of @xmath74 photons for each photon absorbed from the cooling laser beams : @xmath75\\frac{2i\\gamma}{1 + 4\\delta_\\mathrm{pol}^2}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\tauhr}&=&[\\kappa_y+\\frac{3}{10}(1+\\kappa)]\\frac{2i\\gamma}{1 + 4\\delta_\\mathrm{pol}^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the factors @xmath76 and @xmath77 are statistical weights from the dipole radiation pattern for the different directions of spontaneous emission . in this model",
    "we have neglected additional loss and heating processes , like e.g. radiative escape @xcite and radiation trapping @xcite .",
    "the influence of these additional effects will be discussed in the experimental part of this paper .        for simplicity",
    "we assume the coefficients @xmath59 to be time independent .",
    "this is justified for the evaluation of the steady state parameters of the cooling process .",
    "the dynamics of the cooling process can be described only qualitatively within this model , since the optical density will change during cooling and therefore the number of reabsorbed photons increases .",
    "the steady state temperatures are readily derived from eqns .",

    "these minimum temperatures are found at a detuning of @xmath80 , in agreement with free space doppler cooling @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that in this configuration in absence of reabsorption ( i.e. @xmath81 ) the 1d temperature in axial direction @xmath82 is smaller than what is usually called the 1d doppler temperature .",
    "the reason is easily seen : in the 1d model photons can be absorbed and emitted only along the axial direction ; in a 3d model with 1d cooling , photons can be emitted into radial degrees of freedom according to the dipol radiation pattern .",
    "these degrees of freedom take up photon recoil heating and therefore reduce the heating rate in the axial direction . in this situation",
    "the radial energy grows without limit .",
    "if we now include reabsorption , the situation changes . whereas reabsorption only in axial direction ( @xmath83 ) changes the cooling rate but not the steady state temperature , reabsorption in radial direction ( @xmath84 ) provides a cooling effect , that establishes a radial steady state temperature ( eq",

    "[ tvsaspect ] we show an example , where we have integrated these equations for different aspect ratios @xmath90 to calculate the steady state temperatures .",
    "the aspect ratio has no influence on the axial temperature , since cooling is dominated by photons scattered directly from the laser beams . in radial direction",
    "we observe a minimum near a spherical cloud .",
    "for a cigar shaped cloud the optical density in radial direction decreases and for a pancake - shaped cloud the solid angle decreases in which photons contributing to radial cooling can be scattered .",
