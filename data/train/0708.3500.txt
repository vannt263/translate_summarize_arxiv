    "@xcite at densities in the range @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and temperatures of decens of mev or in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "this type of simulations based on monte carlo or molecular dynamics techniques allow for a dynamical description of the nuclear medium usually by using an effective interaction hamiltonian in a semiclassical treatment . in fermionic systems the genuine antisymmetrization of the wave function is considered trough the inclusion of a pauli potential .",
    "pioneering works on this line include those of wilets_et al _  @xcite . in this work",
    "the hamiltonian used to study the low temperature nucleon systems consists of a kinetic energy term and a pauli effective potential ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "@xmath3    where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the kronecker s delta for the nucleon isospin ( spin ) third - component .",
    "@xmath6 is the 3-momentum of @xmath7-th nucleon and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) the relative distance ( momentum ) of the @xmath7-th and @xmath10-th nucleons .",

    "@xcite ,    @xmath11    here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are momentum and length scales related to the excluded phase - space volume that is used to mimic fermionic correlations and @xmath14 is the pauli potential strength .",

    "the parameters of the new pauli potential @xmath21 and @xmath22 will be adjusted to reproduce the kinetic energy per particle and both the momentum distribution and two - body correlation function of a low - temperature fermi gas .",
    "the first and second terms in the potential penalize two particles with the same quantum numbers coming together either in space or momentum .",
    "this retains the essence of the fermionic wave function given by the slater determinant .",
    "the third term forbids any particle from having a momentum significantly larger than the fermi momentum .    in both cases",
    "the potential parameters will depend on the density of the system and this will be crucial in reproducing experimental binding energies when simulating low and medium mass nuclei as will be shown later .",
    "the values for the parameters at saturation density @xmath23 and reduced temperature @xmath24 are given in table 1 .",
    "[ aba : tbl1 ]",
    "the simulations are performed in a nvt system with @xmath25 , and @xmath26 fermions in a cubic box of volume @xmath27 .",
    "then , using the metropolis algorithm the system is thermalized until the stage where configurations are sampled in order to calculate the statistical averages for the magnitudes discussed below .    in fig .",
    "[ aba : fig1 ] the red line shows the kinetic energy per particle for a fermi gas system with @xmath28 particles at @xmath29 as a function of density calculated using the new form of the pauli potential eq.([vpauli1 ] ) . also plot with a black line is the exact result .",
    "we can see that there is a good reproduction of the kinetic energy .    in fig .",

    "the black line shows the exact result .",
    "we can see that a simultaneous good reproduction of both magnitudes is achieved with the alternative new potential but not with the dorso version .",
    "particurlarly the `` fermi hole '' fails to be reproduced at small distances with the dorso potential .",
    "this should be emphasized since these models are used in nuclear many - body simulations as in nuclear _ pastas _ as , for instance , in the work by maruyama _",
    "et al _  @xcite .",
    "the velocity distribution @xcite , not shown here , however peaks at lower values than the momentum distribution due to the fact that canonical and kinematical momentum are not the same quantities  @xcite .",
    "this is a genuine feature in this treatment with momentum dependent pauli potentials in a hamiltonian formalism .",
    "we now show finite nuclei simulation@xcite results calculated with a simplified square - well nuclear potential with @xmath33 mev of width 2 fm and a core with @xmath34 mev and width 1 fm .",
