    "the object v4641 sgr is an x - ray binary with an orbital period of 2.817 d , containing a primary ( a black hole ) of @xmath8 9.6   and a secondary star of 5  8 @xcite .",
    "extensive photometric observations were carried out by @xcite , who reported a photometric period of 2.81728 d , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands light curves which were dominated by ellipsoidal variations from the secondary .",
    "they demonstrated that the surface temperature of the secondary is non  uniform from the observed color variation .",
    "they observed a depression in the red wing of the h@xmath11 line just before the black hole s inferior conjunction , and interpreted this as being due to absorption by the rarefied gas disk around the black hole .",
    "the source exhibited two rapid and bright x - ray flares around 1999 september 15 @xcite .",
    "just prior to the giant x - ray flare , the source showed an increase in the variability @xcite .",
    "about six days before the x - ray flare , the source exhibited a @xmath8 1 mag modulation with a period of @xmath8 2.5 d. after reaching the peak brightness ( 8.8 mag in @xmath9 ) , it decayed rapidly to its mean quiescent level within two days .",
    "since then , the source exhibited several outbursts with very rapid fluctuations in the optical band ( uemura et al .",
    "2002a , 2002b , 2004a , 2004b , 2005 ) .",
    "@xcite carried out extensive spectroscopic observations of v4641 sgr in 1999 and obtained orbital parameters of the system .",
    "the spectral type of the secondary star was assigned to be b9 iii .",
    "they determined the rotational velocity , @xmath2 sin @xmath3 , to be 123 @xmath1 4 km s@xmath4 , and performed spectroscopic analyses of the secondary star using moderate - resolution spectra to estimate the abundances of several light elements .",
    "they found over  abundances of several elements including n , o , mg , ca , and ti , with a solar abundance of si .",
    "although they note that better data ( e.g. , high - resolution spectra ) or better models are needed before establishing the abundance anomalies , their results on ( possible ) over  abundances of light elements are very interesting because chemical abundances of the secondary star are expected to provide direct information on the products of nucleosynthesis from supernova explosions of massive stars .",
    "information on abundances is also expected to constrain many phisical parameters that are involved in supernova explosion models .",
    "they include the mass cut , the amount of fall - back matter , possible mixing , and explosion energies and geometries .",
    "@xcite reported over  abundances of o , mg , si , s , and ti , but a solar abundance of fe , in the eclipsing low  mass x - ray binary gro j1655 - 40 ( nova scorpii 1994 ) . based on this observation and using a variety of supernova models",
    ", @xcite showed that the best fits can be obtained for he star masses of 10  16 , where spherical hypernova models are generally favored over standard supernova ones . over  abundances of al ,",
    "ti , and ni are reported in the black hole binary a062000 by @xcite . they discussed a possible scenario of pollution from a supernova .",
    "@xcite found enhanced abundances of ti , fe , and ni in the neutron star binary cen x-4 , and showed that these apparent anomalies can be explained if the secondary star captured a significant amount of matter ejected from a spherically symmetric supernova explosion of a 4   he core progenitor .    in order to clarify the possible abundance anomalies reported in v4641 sgr",
    ", we carried out high - resolution spectroscopic observations using the subaru telescope and performed comparative abundance analyses using two well - studied reference stars that are reported to have solar abundances .",
    "spectroscopic observations of v4641 sgr were carried out with the subaru telescope using the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ) on 2005 may 21 and june 19 ( ut ) .",
    "our observations were made during its quiescent state , though the object has been reported to exhibit an outburst on 2005 june 24.371 ( ut ) ( m. uemura , private communication ) .",
    "data for two reference stars [ 14 cyg = hd 185872 ( b9 iii ) and @xmath0 cap = hd193432 ( b9.5 v ) ] were obtained on 2005 may 20 and june 19 , respectively , using the same instrumental setup . technical details and the performance of the spectrograph are described in @xcite .",
    "we used a slit width of ( 0.5 mm ) and a 2x2 binning mode , which enabled us to achieve a nominal spectral resolving power of about @xmath12 with a 3.5 pixel sampling .",
    "our observations covered the wavelength region from 4050    to 6760   with a gap between 5340  5450  .",
    "the exposure times for v4641 sgr were 4400 sec and 5400 sec on may 21 and june 19 , respectively . for flat - fielding of the ccd data",
    ", we obtained halogen lamp exposures ( flat images ) with the same setup as that for the object frames .",
    "the reduction of two - dimensional echelle spectral data was performed using the iraf software package in a standard manner .",
    "spectral data extracted from multiple object images of v4641 sgr were averaged in order to improve the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "the wavelength calibration was performed using the th - ar comparison spectra obtained during the observations .",
    "the measured fwhm of the weak th lines was 0.15    at 6000  , and the resulting resolving power was around @xmath13 .",
    "when the observed star shows broadened line profiles due to its high rotational velocity , the process of continuum fitting to the extracted raw spectral data has to be carried out carefully .",
    "a very shallow and wide spectral feature might be mistakenly interpreted as the continuum level when a high - order polynomial function is employed in the process .",
    "the task of continuum fitting the spectral data for v4641 sgr was carried out independently by two of us ( k. s. and m. t .- h . ) using two different approaches .",
    "k. s. saved the fitted functions of each echelle order obtained for the spectra of the sharp - lined stars 14 cyg and @xmath0 cap , and used them to divide the raw spectral data of the corresponding echelle orders of v4641 sgr .",
    "fitted functions of the continuum for 14 cyg and @xmath0 cap were then applied to the v4641 sgr observations obtained on may 21 and june 20 , respectively .",
    "m. t .- h .",
    "carefully selected line - free windows in each echelle order for spectra of the rapidly rotating spectrophotometric standard star feige 15 @xcite , and used them as reference to determine line - free windows in echelle spectra of v4641 sgr . since feige 15 is classified as a spectral type of a0 in the simbad database ( which is operated at cds , strasbourg , france ) , its effective temperature can be regarded as being very close to that of v4641 sgr , with a spectral type of b9 iii , suggesting a spectroscopic similarity between the two stars .",
    "we found good agreement between the results obtained from the two methods , even for very weak features , and concluded that we had correctly obtained normalized spectral data to be used for the abundance analysis .",
    "we compared the spectra of v4641 sgr obtained on two nights [ may 21 and june 19 , at photometric phases 0.38 and 0.62 , respectively , which are calculated using data given in @xcite ] and found no detectable spectral variation .",
    "thus , the data observed on the two nights were averaged in order to obtain the final spectrum , after correcting for the apparent doppler shifts due to the orbital motion .",
    "the s / n ratios of the resulting spectrum of v4641 sgr were measured at several continuum windows near 5000    and 6000  .",
    "the averaged s / n ratio ( per pixel ) were around 180 near 5000    and 210 near 6000  .",
    "for the two reference stars , a much higher s / n ratio ( around 400 ) was achieved at 6000  .",
    "an abundance analysis of v4641 sgr has been carried out relative to the two reference stars 14 cyg and @xmath0 cap .",
    "table 1 lists the absorption lines used in the following analyses .",
    "log @xmath14 values are taken from the vald database @xcite ; atmospheric parameters ( _ @xmath15 _ and log _ g _ ) for these two stars were taken from @xcite .",
    "they are ( _ @xmath16 _ and log _ g _ ) = ( 10750 k , 3.5 ) and ( 10250 k , 4.0 ) for 14 cyg and @xmath0 cap , respectively . abundance analyses of these two stars have been published in @xcite ( 14 cyg ) and in @xcite(@xmath0 cap ) ; solar abundances are reported in these two stars .",
    "we estimated the effective temperature of v4641 sgr by comparing the strengths of the two he  i lines at 4471    and 5876    in v4641 sgr and in the two reference stars , as shown in figure 1 . in the figure ,",
    "the observed spectra of these three stars are compared with simulated ones .",
    "spectral simulations were performed using line - blanketed model atmospheres interpolated from @xcite and assuming the solar abundances ( except for figures 2 and 8 , in which an enhanced abundance of mg by 0.20 dex is assumed ) . in the spectral simulations ,",
    "atomic data , except for the major features listed in table 1 , are taken from @xcite .",
    "equivalent widths of the two he  i lines were measured by directly integrating their profiles in the three stars .",
    "we found that equivalent widths of both of the he  i lines in v4641 sgr are just around the average of the two reference stars and conclude that the _ @xmath16 _ of v4641 sgr is near the average of the two stars ( 10500 @xmath1 200",
    "this is in agreement with that obtained in @xcite .",
    "we adopt the surface gravity ( log _ g _ = 3.5 ) of v4641 sgr given in @xcite , who obtained this value from the measured widths of the balmer lines .",
    "we use a microturbulent velocity @xmath17@xmath18 = 1.6 km s@xmath4 in @xmath0 cap @xcite , and assume @xmath17@xmath18 = 2.0 km s@xmath4 in 14 cyg .",
    "it is difficult to determine the microturbulent velocity in v4641 sgr because we can not measure the weak metallic lines , which are in any case unaffected by a change in @xmath17@xmath18 , in this star .",
    "the microturbulent velocity was guessed to be around 2.5 @xmath1 0.5 km s@xmath4 by simulating the spectral region between 4505 and 4535   , where moderately strong ( 80 - 150 m ) fe  ii lines can be found , to obtain the best fitting , assuming an appropriate rotational velocity ( @xmath2 sin @xmath3 , described in the next section ) .",
    "we estimate the rotational velocity , @xmath2 sin @xmath3 , of v4641 sgr from the observed profile of the mg  ii line at 4481   , as shown in figure 2 .",
    "first , we tried to reproduce the profiles of the line in 14 cyg and @xmath0 cap by adopting the mean values of published data of @xmath2 sin @xmath3 .",
    "they are 30 and 25 km s@xmath4 for 14 cyg ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and @xmath0 cap ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "we find that acceptable reproductions of the observed line profile can be obtained using adopted values of @xmath2 sin @xmath3 for the two stars , as shown in figure 8 .",
    "next , we searched for a suitable value of @xmath2 sin @xmath3 in v4641 sgr by exploring values between 60 and 150 km s@xmath4 ; we found that the best fit is achieved at 95 @xmath1 10 km s@xmath4 .",
    "if we use @xmath2 sin @xmath3 = 123 km s@xmath4 , as obtained in @xcite , the simulated profile becomes too shallow and too wide ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we conclude that their result of @xmath2 sin @xmath3 is too large , most probably resulting from the low resolution of their spectral data .",
    "we tried to estimate the abundance of c in v4641 sgr using the c  ii line at 4267    ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the line consists of two major components at 4267.001    and at 4267.261    ( table 2 ) .",
    "the c  ii feature in @xmath0 cap can be reproduced with a solar abundance of c , while the observed feature in 14 cyg appears to be too weak .",
    "this may suggest either a slight under  abundance of c or an error in the adopted atmospheric parameters for 14 cyg .",
    "we find that the broard feature at 4267    in v4641 sgr can be reproduced by assuming a solar abundance of c.    we find a shallow and broard absorption feature at 6483    in v4641 sgr in",
    "both the may 20 and june 19 data .",
    "comparisons with the two reference stars ( figure 4 ) shows that the feature in v4641 sgr appears to be too deep .",
    "the feature coincides with the positions of the five components of n  i lines ( multiplet no .",
    "we simulated spectra of both reference stars , assuming solar abundances , and find that observations can be reasonably reproduced when excluding the sharp components due to atmospheric absorption .",
    "the only observable feature is the fe  ii line at 6482.204  .",
    "on the other hand , the observed feature of v4641 sgr at 6483    can not be reproduced when we assume solar abundances of n and fe .",
    "a reasonable reproduction can be obtained when a significant over  abundance of n ( by around 1.0 dex ) is assumed , as shown in figure 4 . allowing for a slight uncertainty in the continuum level because of the low s / n ratio",
    ", we conclude that n is indeed over  abundant in v4641 sgr by at least 0.8 dex .",
    "this conclusion is in accordance with the result noted in @xcite , who obtained an over  abundance of n by 1.0 dex from an analysis of the same spectral feature .",
    "analyses of weak o  i lines near 6455    are shown in figure 5 .",
    "we conclude that the o  i feature can be reasonably fit by using a solar o abundance .",
    "this is in contrast with the result given in @xcite , who obtained an over  abundance of o ( by a factor of three ) , when analysing the same spectral feature .",
    "next , we analyse the na  i d lines . the d lines are usually contaminated by interstellar absorption superposed on the stellar components , as shown for 14 cyg and @xmath0 cap ( figure 6 ) .",
    "fortunately , spectral lines of v4641 sgr observed on july 19 are significantly redshifted ( by + 210 km s@xmath4 ) , and we can analyse both of the d1 and d2 components , which are unaffected by interstellar absorptions .",
    "the broad d lines in v4641 sgr are too strong to be accounted for by the solar na abundance .",
    "as is shown in figure 6 , we need to enhance the abundance of na by 0.7 dex in order to fit the d2 line .",
    "further enhancement ( by 0.2 dex ) of the na abundance is needed to fit the d1 line ( although the d1 line is heavily affected by atmospheric absorption ) . upon averaging the results obtained from the d1 and d2 lines",
    ", we concluded that na is over  abundant by at least 0.8 dex in v4641 sgr .",
    "the abundances of six elements ( mg , si , al , ti , cr , and fe ) in v4641 sgr were estimated by comparing the major absorption features of each element with those seen in the two reference stars .",
    "figures 7 to 11 display the results . in these figures ,",
    "the solid lines show simulated spectra for each star , assuming solar abundances ( except for figure 8 , where an enhanced abundance of mg is assumed ) , taken from @xcite .",
    "neutral and singly ionized lines of mg are shown in figures 7 and 8 , respectively .",
    "we find that the mg  i triplet lines can be reproduced with a solar abundance of mg , while a slight enhancement ( 0.20 dex ) of mg is suggested from the observed profile of the mg  ii line at 4481  .",
    "on the other hand , the mg  ii feature at 4390.5    in v4641 sgr can be reproduced by assuming a solar mg abundance .",
    "thus , we conclude that the abundance of mg in v4641 sgr coincides with that of the sun , which differs from the results reported by @xcite , who concluded that this star exhibits an enhanced ( by a factor of seven ) abundance of mg .",
    "we find that an al  ii line at 4663 05    is clearly present in both of the two reference stars , and in v4641 sgr ( figure 9 ) .",
    "our spectral analyses of this line suggests that al may by slightly over  abundant ( by + 0.2 dex ) in v4641 sgr , although the relatively poor s / n ratio in the blue region does not allow for a reliable analysis of the line .",
    "a pair of si  ii lines near 5050    are compared in figure 10 .",
    "we conclude that the abundance of si in v4641 sgr is close to the solar abundance . in figure 11",
    ", we compare ti  ii , cr  ii , and fe  ii   lines , where all of the absorption features can be reproduced by assuming the same ( solar ) abundances in the three stars .",
    "we analyse several other strong ti  ii , cr  ii , and fe  ii   lines ( noted in table 1 ) and found that all of these features in v4641 sgr can be explained using solar abundances of ti , cr , and fe .",
    "our result for ti is again in contrast with the result given in @xcite , who obtained an over  abundance of ti ( by a factor of 10 ) .",
    "they used four ti  ii lines ( at 5129.2  , 5185.9  , 5188.7  , and at 5226.5  ) to obtain the ti abundance , and pointed out a high abundance of ti from the two lines ( at 5129.2    and 5226.5  ) using data of spectral resolution of about 4  .",
    "we examined all of these lines on our high - resolution data and find that all these lines are very weak in the reference stars , and also in v4641 sgr , when compared to those ti  ii lines listed in table 1 .",
    "we concluded that the four lines used in @xcite are inadequate to be used for the abundance analysis of ti .",
    "our final derived abundances for 10 observed elements ( 11 ions ) are summarized in table 2 , together with their expected errors .",
    "we estimate uncertainties in the abundances of each ion introduced by errors in the adopted parameters : 200 k in _ @xmath16 _ , 0.5 in log @xmath19 , and 0.5 km s@xmath4 in @xmath17@xmath18 .",
    "when these errors are combined , we conclude that the our abundance analysis results are reliable within 0.25 dex ( table 2 ) .",
    "we examined the effect of a difference in spectral resolution on the resulting abundances by a simple test .",
    "the original data of both 14 cyg and v4641 sgr were degraded to around @xmath20 , the highest resolution used in @xcite , by convolving with an appropriate gaussian function .",
    "we then repeated abundance analyses using the degraded data for several spectral features such as the mg  ii line at 4481   , the mg  i triplet lines , and the three ti  ii lines listed in table 1 .",
    "fairly good agreements ( within 0.05 dex ) were found for 14 cyg from both high and low resolution data . on the other hand , differences as large as 0.15 dex were found between abundance results obtained from weak and noisy spectral features in the case of v4641 sgr .",
    "we infer that these differences are mainly resulted from the relatively poor sn ratio in the v4641 sgr data , but not from the difference in the spectral resolution .",
    "when the limited s / n ratio of our observation and the high rotational velocity of v4641 sgr are taken into account , the expected error in the abundances should be increased to around 0.3 dex .",
    "we obtained abundances of 10 elements in v4641 sgr , and found definite over  abundances of only two elements ( n and na ) .",
    "the abundances of the eight other elements in v4641 sgr have been shown to be the same as those in the two reference stars ( solar abundances ) , except for a possible enhancement of mg suggested from the mg  ii  line at 4481    and that of al . however , when averaged with the result obtained from the mg  i triplet lines and the mg  ii line at 4390.5  , the abundance of mg is coincident with that in the reference stars within the expected error ( [ mg / h ] = + 0.10 @xmath1 0.30 ) .",
    "the above conclusions are in contrast to the results noted in @xcite except for n , where they concluded over  abundances of n ( 1.0 dex ) , o ( 0.48 dex ) , mg ( 0.85 dex ) , and ti ( 1.0 dex ) in v4641 sgr when compared to the sun .",
    "we suggest that the primary reason for obtaining discordant abundances for o , mg , and ti is the difference in the spectral resolution of the data .",
    "@xcite used a much lower resolving power ( @xmath10 ranging from 1200 to 7700 ) than obtained in the present study ( @xmath10 @xmath8 40000 ) .    our results for the abundances of the light elements in the secondary star of v4641 sgr [ definite over  abundances of n and na , normal ( solar ) abundances of o , and the @xmath11-elements mg , si , and ti ] are unique when compared with the results obtained for other x - ray binaries .",
    "abundances obtained in four secondary stars in x - ray binaries are compared in figure 12 [ v4641 sgr ( this study ) , gro j1655 - 40 @xcite , a0620 - 00 @xcite , and cen x4 @xcite ] .",
    "we note that all four stars show distinct abundance patterns .",
    "the @xmath11-elements ( o , mg , si , s , and ti ) are definitely over  abundant in gro j1655 - 40 , while they appear to be normal in v4641 sgr .",
    "fe is over  abundant only in cen x-4 .",
    "n and na are over  abundant only in v4641 sgr .",
    "the difference in the abundances of o between v4641 sgr and gro j1655 - 40 is impressive .",
    "the observed abundance pattern in v4641 sgr ( enhanced n and na , and normal @xmath11-elements ) seems to be different from those of the usual supernova models that predict the enhancement of @xmath11-elements ( @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "however , these variations of abundance patters can be explained with the variations of the abundances of supernova explosions that are associated with black hole formation @xcite .    in order to explain the abundances in v4641 sgr quantitatively , we calculated the evolution of the star with the initial mass of 40 @xmath21 and the solar metallicity from the main - sequence to collapse as in @xcite and constructed the following evolutionary models for v4641 sgr . in the close binary system ,",
    "this 40 @xmath21 primary star underwent a common envelope phase and lost most of its h - rich envelope until it became a he star of mass 15.14 @xmath21 .",
    "the system also lost its angular momentum and became compact with the orbital period as short as that observed .",
    "figure 13 shows the abundance distribution near the surface of the he star at the onset of collapse . in the he - rich layer , @xmath22n and @xmath23na",
    "were enhanced by the cno - cycle and ne - na cycle ( proton captures on @xmath24ne and @xmath25ne ) during h - burning . in the deeper",
    "he layer , the @xmath22n abundance was decreased by successive @xmath11-capture to produce @xmath25ne during weak he shell burning .    the 15 @xmath21 he star is massive enough to eventually formed a black hole ( bh ) .",
    "we assume that the collapse induced a relatively weak explosion .",
    "generally , an explosion with a smaller energy leads to a larger amount of fall back materials and thus a smaller amount of ejecta ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in order to reproduce the observations of v4641 sgr",
    ", we assume that the kinetic energy of explosion was as small as @xmath26 ergs .",
    "in such a weak explosion , only 0.5 @xmath21 materials above @xmath27 were ejected .",
    "the abundance distribution in the he layer in figure 13 does not change in the explosion .",
    "a part of the ejected materials must be captured by the secondary star .",
    "the captured ( accreted ) materials were then mixed with the materials of solar metallicity in the atmosphere of the secondary star .",
    "since the ejecta is relatively n- and na - rich without any enhancement of @xmath11-elements , this could explain the observed abundance pattern of v4641 sgr . if the accreted material is mixed with 40-times larger amount of secondary star materials , the final abundance pattern would be consistent with the observed abundance pattern of the secondary star ( figure 14 ) . here ,",
    "most of the heavy elements above na originated from the materials of v1641 sgr .",
    "such a partial mixing ( e.g. , slow rotational mixing ) may be realized because the surface temperature of v4641 sgr is too high for deep convective mixing to occur .",
    "we should note that an alternative scenario is possible .",
    "if the stellar wind of the he star of @xmath8 15 @xmath21 blows at a high enough rate , a part of the n- and na - rich materials in the he layer would have been blown off and captured by the secondary star .",
    "if the energy of supernova explosion was even smaller than @xmath28 , no mass ejection occurred . these processes",
    "could lead to the observed abundance pattern of v4641 sgr .",
    "the above 40 @xmath21 model formed a bh of 14 @xmath21 .",
    "the initially 30 @xmath21 model produces a similar abundance pattern by forming a 7.2 @xmath21 bh .",
    "since the observed bh mass of v4641 sgr is @xmath29 , the progenitor of the bh in v4641 is likely a @xmath5 star .",
    "it is highly uncertain in the current supernova models under what condition the bh formation can induce a supernova explosion and how much explosion energy can be released ; it may depend on the rotation of the bh and the progenitor .",
    "the case of v4641 sgr suggests the bh- forming supernova was really _ dark _ , because no radioactive @xmath7ni was ejected .",
    "such a _ dark _ supernova corresponds to the extreme end of the _ faint _ supernova branch @xcite .",
    "another possible scenario is the contamination by rotationally induced mixing in the secondary star , itself .",
    "however , the observed rotational velocity ( @xmath30  km s@xmath31 ) and estimated mass may be lower than those predicted for the simultaneous enhancements of n and na , although they strongly depend on the uncertain inclination .",

    "<S> k ) is estimated from the strengths of he  i lines , while its rotational velocity , @xmath2 sin @xmath3 ( 95 @xmath1 10 km s@xmath4 ) , is estimated from the profile of the mg  ii line at 4481  . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain abundances of 10 elements and find definite over  abundances of n ( by 0.8 dex or more ) and na ( by 0.8 dex ) in v4641 sgr . from line - by - line comparisons of eight other elements ( c , o , mg , al , si , ti , cr , and fe ) between v4641 sgr and the two reference stars </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that there is no apparent difference in the abundances of these elements between v4641 sgr and the two normal late b - type stars , which have been reported to have solar abundances . </S>",
    "<S> an evolutionary model of a massive close binary system has been constructed to explain the abundances observed in v4641 sgr . </S>",
    "<S> the model suggests that the progenitor of the black hole forming supernova was as massive as @xmath5 on the main - sequence and , after becoming a @xmath6 he star , underwent `` dark '' explosion which ejected only n and na - rich outer layer of the he star without radioactive @xmath7ni . </S>"
