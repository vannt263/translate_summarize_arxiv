    "recently the possibility to measure @xmath2 by a reactor experiment has attracted much attention  @xcite . to achieve sensitivity @xmath3 , reduction of the systematic errors is crucial , and near and far detectors seem to be necessary for that purpose . on the other hand , it appears to be advantageous to do an experiment at a multi - reactor site to gain statistics and high signal to noise ratio , and in fact in the most of cases considered in @xcite there are more than one reactor . in this paper",
    "we discuss the systematic errors in reactor neutrino oscillation experiments with multi reactors and multi detectors in an analytical way .",
    "in sect.2 we discuss the cases with a single reactor to illustrate our analytical method .",
    "in sect.3 we consider the cases with @xmath4 reactors and show that the larger @xmath4 gives totally the smaller contribution to the sensitivity from the uncorrelated errors of the fluxes .",
    "irrespective of the number of reactors , if there are more than one detectors , we can cancel the correlated errors which includes the error of the fluxes .",
    "we emphasize in this paper that the sensitivity on @xmath0 with vanishing statistical errors ( we refer to the sensitivity as the systematic limit ) is dominated by the uncorrelated error of the detectors in most cases .",
    "it is also emphasized that a lot of caution has to be exercised to estimate the uncorrelated error . in the appendix",
    "we give some details on how to derive the analytic results used in the main text , using the equivalence of the pull method and the covariance matrix approach  @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we do not use the binning of the numbers of events because the discussions on the uncorrelated bin - to - bin systematic errors are complicated .",
    "also we will discuss only the systematic errors , i.e. , we will consider the case where the statistical errors are negligibly small .",
    "to discuss the systematic limit on @xmath0 in neutrino oscillation experiments with multiple reactors , we have to introduce the systematic errors of the detectors and the reactors ( fluxes ) .",
    "there are two kinds of systematic errors of the detectors , namely , the correlated error @xmath5 and uncorrelated error @xmath6 .",
    "the former includes the theoretical uncertainty in the cross section of detection , etc .  while the latter does the uncertainty in the baseline lengths , a portion of measuring the detector volume , a part of the detection efficiency , etc . as for the systematic errors of the reactors ( fluxes ) , the correlated error @xmath7 consists of the uncertainties in the spectrum of the @xmath8 flux , etc.whereas the uncorrelated error @xmath9 consists of the uncertainties in the composition of the fuel , etc . in this paper",

    "@xmath10 and @xmath1 can be estimated to be @xmath11 where the factor @xmath12 appears because the relative normalization @xmath13=0.8% in @xcite is related to @xmath1 by @xmath14 . in the estimation of @xmath10",

    "now let us see the effects of multiple sources on the systematic limit @xmath63 in the kaska plan .",
    "since the effect comes with @xmath150 ( compare ( [ chi4 ] ) with ( [ chi0 ] ) ) , we can ignore other errors .",
    "the systematic limit for the case is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with solid line ; @xmath150 is assumed to be 2.3% .",
    "note that the systematic limit is extremely close to zero for one reactor case because of ideal near - far cancellation .",
    "the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows , however , that about 0.4% error remains .",
    "thus , we find that the effect of the nature of multiple sources is only about 0.4% .",
    "it is vary small compared to the relative normalization error @xmath151 of the detectors .. ] once we know that two near detectors are sufficient for near - far cancellation with the kashiwazaki - kariwa nuclear power station , we should investigate the optimal locations of the near detectors for the cancellation . while the two near detectors are assumed to be very close to the reactors in the ideal limit ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) ) , the near detectors in the actual kaska case can not be too close to the reactors .",
    "if each of the two near detectors is too close to a reactor , it is impossible to cancel the uncorrelated error of the flux from other reactors , namely @xmath152 .",
    "hence , the optimization of the locations of two near detectors at the kashiwazaki - kariwa site is nontrivial . at first , in order to see the importance of the location of near detectors , we compare the systematic limits of the actual kaska plan ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) ) with that of a hypothetical experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](f ) ) in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ; in the hypothetical experiment , one near detector is very close to the reactor # 1 in the first cluster while the other detector is very close to the reactor # 5 in the second one . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we use @xmath153 and all other systematic errors are set to zero because @xmath92 dominates the difference of near - far cancellations in the two cases . for @xmath73 , we obtain @xmath154 for the actual kaska plan ( the hypothetical case ) . in the hypothetical case ,",
    "the sensitivity is deteriorated because the correlated error @xmath92 is not canceled sufficiently and about 2% error remains .",
    "we can extend this analysis to that with the arbitrary position of each detector . to do the analysis",
    ", we first obtain the optimized positions of the detectors .",
    "and then we examine the sensitivity to @xmath61 by varying the position of each detector , leaving the locations of the remaining detectors in the optimized ones .",
    "the results are given by the contour plots in fig .",
    "[ figkka ] without statistical errors and in fig .",
    "[ figkkb ] with the data size of 20 ton@xmath147yr , where the reference values in eqs .",
    "( [ error1 ] ) and ( [ error2 ] ) are used . in these figures the locations of the detectors",
    "are also depicted for the optimized case and for the currently planned case . from these two figures",
    "we observe that the distance between each near detector and the reactors in each cluster is approximately ( 300@xmath155130)m in the optimized case .",
    "this results in slightly poorer sensitivity to @xmath61 , compared with the hypothetical single reactor case with a near detector which is arbitrarily close to the reactor ( see eq .",
    "( [ sens1 ] ) with @xmath70 ) . from figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] ,  [ figkka ] ,  [ figkkb ] , we see that the positions of the near detectors in the kaska plan are appropriate for the near - far cancellation and almost optimized .",
    "therefore , it does not suffer from the multi - reactor nature such as the variety of reactor powers or distances between the reactors and the near detectors .",
    "using the analytical method , we estimated the systematic limits ( sensitivity without statistical error ) on the neutrino oscillation parameter @xmath156 in various setups of reactor experiments . in the simplest case , where there is one reactor and two detectors , the correlated systematic error is canceled . in the case of multiple @xmath4 reactors",
    ", we showed that the correlated systematic errors of the reactors and the detectors are canceled as naive expectation if the number of detectors @xmath95 is sufficient ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "we found that multiple reactors and detectors set up has an advantage of the reduction of the remaining uncorrelated error if the set up is appropriate for the near - far cancellation of correlated errors . on the other hand",
    ", we explicitly showed that the contribution to the sensitivity to @xmath156 from the the uncorrelated error of the flux , which controls the multi - reactor nature , is negligibly small although there are only three detectors for seven reactors ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "the only disadvantage of experiments with @xmath159 is that one can not put the near detectors arbitrarily close to one of the reactors ( even if one neglects the technical difficulties ) , because that would ruin the cancellation of the uncorrelated error of the flux , as we have seen explicitly in the kaska case .",
    "we presented also the optimal positions of detectors in the kaska plan ; the planned position of near detectors are close to the optimal ones although it is better if the baseline length for the far detector becomes longer beyond the bound of the power station site . in all cases studies here , it is the factor @xmath160 $ ] that sets the systematic limit on @xmath156 , and hence it is quite important to estimate @xmath1 carefully .",
    "the factor @xmath146 seems to be a good measure of the power of a reactor experiment almost independently of assumptions of error sizes .",
    "in this appendix we first show that the form of @xmath18 which is expressed as the minimum of the function of the @xmath24 variables with respect to these variables leads to the form of @xmath18 which is bilinear in the ratio @xmath161 of the measured value @xmath162 divided by the theoretical prediction @xmath163 . this has been known in the literature @xcite as the equivalence between the so - called pull approach and the covariance matrix approach .",
