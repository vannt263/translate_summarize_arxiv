    "the study of hamiltonian symplectic actions in the past thirty years has been a driving force in equivariant symplectic geometry , and there is an extensive theory , which includes several classification results .",
    "it is natural to wonder whether there are interesting classes of actions that are symplectic , but not hamiltonian , and if so , whether they may be viewed as part of a larger cohesive framework . from a geometric view point , being only symplectic is a natural assumption , and while hamiltonian actions of maximal dimension appear as symmetries in many integrable systems in mechanics , non - hamiltonian actions also occur in physics , see eg .",
    "novikov  @xcite , as well as in complex algebraic geometry , and in topology .",
    "in this paper we review the classical results about symplectic hamiltonian actions by atiyah , guillemin - sternberg , and delzant @xcite , and then present a number of recent results ( since around 2002 ) on the classification of certain classes of non - hamiltonian symplectic torus actions , and which are contained in the work benoist , duistermaat , and the author @xcite .",
    "we outline connections of these works with algebraic geometry ( in particular kodaira s classification of complex analytic surfaces @xcite ) , with topology ( in particular the work of benson - gordon @xcite on torus bundles over tori and nilpotent lie groups ) , with the work of guillemin - sternberg on multiplicity - free spaces @xcite , and also with orbifold theory ( for instance thurston s classification of compact @xmath2-dimensional orbifolds ) .    throughout the paper we emphasize the role that the hamiltonian theory of atiyah et al .",
    "plays in the non - hamiltonian theory ; essentially , when a non - hamiltonian torus action has a subtorus which acts in a hamiltonian fashion , the hamiltonian theory can be applied to symplectically characterize the action of such subtori in terms of a combinatorial invariant ( a polytope ) .",
    "the proofs of the results by atiyah et al . are covered from a number of view points in the literature ( see for instance guillemin s book @xcite ) , and we will not attempt to discuss them further . instead , we will describe in a way accessible to non experts the recent symplectic classifications in  @xcite , making an emphasis in the construction of the symplectic invariants that appear in the classification theorems .",
    "we also carry out the computation of the invariants in examples such as the kodaira variety @xcite ( also known as the kodaira - thurston manifold @xcite ) .",

    "hamiltonian_.    the category of hamiltonian actions , while large , does not include some simple examples of symplectic actions , for instance free symplectic actions on compact manifolds , because hamiltonian actions on compact manifolds always have fixed points .",
    "one striking ( and basic ) open question is : are there non - hamiltonian symplectic @xmath13-actions on compact connected manifolds with non - empty _ and _ discrete fixed point set ? in recent years there has been a flurry of activity related to this question , see for instance godinho  @xcite , jang  @xcite , li - liu @xcite , pelayo - tolman   @xcite , sabatini  @xcite , and tolman - weitsman  @xcite ; the answer is unknown .    in the present paper",
    "we will not discuss this question because the dimension of the torus is one , and instead we focus on symplectic actions of tori of dimension @xmath14 on manifolds of dimension @xmath1 where @xmath15 .",
    "when in addition to being symplectic the action is hamiltonian , then necessarily @xmath16 , but there are many non - hamiltonian symplectic actions when @xmath16 , and also when @xmath17 .",
    "we will concentrate on smplectic non - hamiltonian actions in three distinct cases : when the manifold is four - dimensional , when there is an orbit of maximal dimension which is symplectic , and when there is a coisotropic orbit ( these last two cases are disjoint from each other , and the four dimensional case overlaps with both of them ) .",
    "the moduli space of symplectic actions satisfying one of these conditions is large , and includes as a particular case hamiltonian actions of maximal dimension ( see @xcite for the description of the moduli space of hamiltonian actions of maximal dimension on @xmath18-manifolds ) .",
    "some of the techniques to study hamiltonian torus actions ( see for instance the books by guillemin  @xcite , guillemin - sjamaar  @xcite , and ortega - ratiu  @xcite ) are useful in the study of non - hamiltonian symplectic torus actions ( since many non - hamiltonian actions exhibit proper subgroups which act hamiltonianly ) . in the study of hamiltonian actions ,",
    "one tool that is often used is morse theory for the ( components of the ) momentum map of the action .",
    "since there is no momentum map in the classical sense for a general symplectic action , morse theory does not appear as a natural tool in the non - hamiltonian case .",
    "there is an analogue , however , _",
    "circle valued - morse theory _",
    "( since any symplectic circle action admits a circle - valued momentum map , see mcduff  @xcite and @xcite , which is also morse in a sense ) but it is less immediately useful in our setting ; for instance a more complicated form of the morse inequalities holds ( see pajitnov  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 11 , proposition 2.4 ) and farber  ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.4 ) ) , and the theory appears more difficult to apply , at least in the context of non - hamiltonian symplectic actions ; see ( * ? ? ?",

    ". this could be one reason that non - hamiltonian symplectic actions have been studied less in the literature than their hamiltonian counterparts .",

    "for instance , a compact symplectic manifold endowed with a symplectic action with lagrangian orbits ( eg . the kodaira variety ) is characterized in terms of four symplectic invariants ( theorem  [ t2 ] ) ; if the action is also hamiltonian , only one invariant remains ( the polytope @xmath19 ) .",
