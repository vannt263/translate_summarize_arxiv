    "in 1996 yamazaki et al . discovered a bound state formed out of a @xmath0 meson and a @xmath1pb nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the negatively charged pion was bound with the lead nucleus by means of the coulomb interaction and the interplay between an attractive coulomb and a repulsive strong potential lead to the very narrow state with the width of less than one  mev . due to the nature of the binding",
    "we can consider the state as a pionic atom .",
    "it is also conceivable that a neutral meson could be bound to a nucleus . in this case",
    "the binding is exclusively due to the strong interaction and hence such object can be called a _",
    "mesic nucleus_. here the most promissing candidate is the @xmath2-mesic nucleus since the @xmath2n interaction is attractive and since there exists a baryonic resonance ( n@xmath3 ) which couples predominantly to the @xmath2n channel  @xcite",
    ". we may picture  @xcite the formation and decay of the @xmath2-mesic nucleus as the @xmath2 meson absorption by one of the nucleons and then its propagation in the nucleus via subsequent excitation of nucleons to the n@xmath3 state until the resonance decays into the pion - nucleon pair which escapes from the nucleus .",
    "predicted values of the width of such states range from @xmath47 to @xmath440  mev  @xcite .",
    "the search of the @xmath2  -  mesic nucleus was conducted in many inclusive experiments  @xcite via reactions induced by pions  @xcite , protons  @xcite , and photons  @xcite .",
    "many promissing indications of the existence of such an object were reported  @xcite , but so far none was independently confirmed .",
    "experimental investigations with higher statistical sensitivity and the detection of the n@xmath3 decay products are being continued at the cosy  @xcite , jinr  @xcite , and mami  @xcite laboratories . in this contribution",
    "we report on searches of the @xmath2  -  mesic helium in exclusive measurements carried out at the cooler synchrotron cosy by means of the wasa - at - cosy  @xcite and cosy-11  @xcite detector setups .",
    "we consider the study of the @xmath2-mesic nuclei as interesting on its own account , but additionally it is useful for investigations of ( i ) the @xmath2n interaction , ( ii ) the n@xmath3 properties in nuclear matter  @xcite , ( iii ) the properties of the @xmath2 meson in the nuclear medium  @xcite , and ( iv ) the flavour singlet component of the @xmath2 meson  @xcite .",
    "in 1985 bhalerao and liu  @xcite performed a coupled - channel analysis of the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 reactions and discovered that the interaction between the nucleon and the @xmath2 meson is attractive . based on this finding",
    "haider and liu postulated the existence of the @xmath2mesic nuclei  @xcite , in which the electrically neutral @xmath2 meson might be bound with the nucleons by the strong interaction .",
    "the formation of such a bound state can only take place if the real part of the @xmath2-nucleus scattering length is negative ( attraction ) , and the magnitude of the real part is greater than the magnitude of the imaginary part  @xcite . in the 1980 s the @xmath2mesic nuclei",
    "were considered to exists for a  @xmath8  12  only  @xcite due to the relatively small value of the @xmath2n scattering length ( @xmath9  fm  @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent theoretical investigations of hadronic- and photo - production of the @xmath2 meson result in values of @xmath10 which depending on the analysis method range from @xmath11  fm up to @xmath12  fm  @xcite , and which do not exclude the formation of a bound @xmath2-nucleus states for such light nuclei as helium  @xcite or even for deuteron  @xcite . according to the calculations including multiple scattering theory  @xcite or skyrme model",
    "@xcite an especially good candidate for binding is the @xmath13 system .",
    "recent calculations by haider  @xcite or tryasuchev and isaev  @xcite also indicate the binding in the @xmath13 system , while they rather exclude the existence of the @xmath14 state .",
    "on the other hand there are promissing experimental signals which may be interpreted as indications of the the @xmath15 bound state .",
    "for example the shape of the excitation function for the @xmath16 reaction  @xcite , determined by the spes-4  @xcite , spes-2  @xcite , cosy-11  @xcite , and cosy - anke  @xcite collaborations  ( fig .  [ fig1](left ) )",
    ".     reaction as determined by the cosy - anke  @xcite ( open circles ) and the cosy-11  @xcite ( full dots ) and  @xcite ( triangles ) .",
    "the solid and dashed lines represent the scattering length fit to the cosy-11 and cosy - anke data , respectively .",
    "( right ) angular asymmetry parameter @xmath17 .",
    "closed and open circles represent results of cosy - anke  @xcite and cosy-11  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the dashed and solid lines denote results  @xcite of the fit ( allowing for the phase variation ) to the cosy-11 and cosy - anke data , respectively .",
    "the dotted line denotes result of the fit without the phase variation .",
    "the figure is adopted from ref .",
    "@xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    it has been indicated by wilkin  @xcite that a steep rise of the total cross section in the very close - to - threshold region followed by a plateau may be due to the existence of a pole of the @xmath18 scattering amplitude in the complex excess energy plane @xmath19 with @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "this reference shows that the occurence of the pole changes the phase and the magnitude of the s - wave production amplitude .",
    "and indeed the momentum dependence of the asymmetry in the angular distributions of @xmath21 expressed in terms of a parameter @xmath17  @xcite , can only be satisfactorily described ( solid and dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) ) if a very strong phase variation associated with the pole is included in the fits  @xcite .",
    "otherwise there is a significant discrepancy between the experimental data and the theoretical description ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) ) .",
    "details of the experimental technique and the comprehensive description of results concerning the search of the @xmath2-mesic @xmath23 nucleus conducted by the cosy-11 group were described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "therefore , here we only briefly summarize the main results .",
    "the measurements were carried out using the deuteron beam of cosy which was circulating through the stream of the internal hydrogen target of the cluster - jet type  @xcite .",
    "data were taken during a slow acceleration of the beam from 3.095  gev / c to 3.180  gev / c , crossing the kinematical threshold for the @xmath2 production in the @xmath24 reaction at 3.141  gev / c .",
    "the determined excitation function for the @xmath25 process does not show any structure which could originate from a decay of @xmath26 bound state .",
    "the estimated upper limit for the cross section of the @xmath27 reaction chain is equal to 70  nb  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the analysis of the @xmath28 reaction resulted only in an upper limit of 270  nb for the total cross section of the @xmath29 reaction  @xcite .",
    "the installation of the wasa detector at cosy opened a unique possibility to search for the @xmath31 bound state with high statistics and high acceptance .",
    "we have conducted a search via an exclusive measurement of the excitation function for the @xmath32 reaction varying continuously the beam momentum around the threshold for the @xmath33 reaction .",
    "ramping of the beam momentum and taking advantage of the large acceptance of the wasa detector reaction the acceptance of the wasa - at - cosy detector equals to almost 70% . ] allows to minimize systematical uncertainities making the wasa - at - cosy a unique facility  @xcite for such kind of exclusive experiments .",
    "the @xmath34 bound state should manifest itself as a resonant like structure below the threshold for the @xmath35 reaction .",
    "if a peak below the @xmath36 threshold is found , then the profile of the excitation curve will allow to determine the binding energy and the width of the @xmath37 bound state .",
    "if , however , only an enhancement around the threshold is found , then it will enable to establish the relation between width and binding energy  @xcite .",
    "finally , if no structure is seen the upper limit for the cross section of the production of the @xmath2-helium nucleus will be set at few nanobarns .",
    "in addition , when searching for the signal of the @xmath2-mesic state we may take advantage of the fact that the distribution of the relative angle between the @xmath38 pair for the background ( due to the prompt @xmath39 reaction ) is much broader than the one expected from the decay of the bound state .",
    "this is because the relative angle between the outgoing @xmath38 pair originating from the decay of the n@xmath3 resonance is equal to 180@xmath40 in the n@xmath41 reference frame and it is smeared only by about 30@xmath40 in the reaction center - of - mass frame due to the fermi motion of the nucleons inside the @xmath42 nucleus .",
    "this allows for an additional control of the background by comparing excitation functions corresponding to the `` signal - rich '' and `` signal - poor '' regions .",
    "in the first experiment conducted in june 2008 , we used a deuteron pellet target and the cosy deuteron beam with a ramped momentum corresponding to a variation of the excess energy for the @xmath37 system from -51.4  mev to 22  mev . at present",
    "the data are evaluated and some preliminary results were reported  @xcite . the experiment will be continued in 2010  @xcite .",
    "two weeks of cosy beamtime were already recommended by the cosy program advisory committee .",
    "the systematic uncertainties in establishing the shape of the excitation functions discussed in the previous sections are significantly reduced by using the momentum ramping technique since the energy range of interest for the search of the @xmath2-mesic nucleus is scanned in each cosy cycle .",
    "a scan of the energy can also be achieved in the case of the fixed beam energy available for the external beam experiments .",
    "this may be realised by means of the quasi - free reactions as already successfully used at cosy for the study of the meson production in quasi free proton - neutron collisions  @xcite .",
    "for instance , a search of the @xmath2-mesic tritium may be realized by studying the exitation function of the @xmath43 reaction using a deutron beam and tagging the nd reactions by the measurement of the spectator protons ( @xmath44 ) from the @xmath45 reaction .",
    "the fermi motion of nucleons inside the deuteron beam will allow to scan a large range ( in the order of 100  mev ) of excess energies in the nd reaction .",
    "the work was supported by the european community - research infrastructure activity under the fp6 program ( hadron physics , rii3-ct-2004 - 506078 ) , by the german research foundation ( dfg ) , by the ffe grants from the research center jlich , and by the polish ministry of science and higher education ( 3240/h03/2006/31 and 1202/dfg/2007/03 ) .",
