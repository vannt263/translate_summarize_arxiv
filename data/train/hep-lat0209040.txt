    "we consider , on the lattice , a running coupling constant @xmath2 defined by @xcite @xmath3 \\,\\left[\\,p^2\\,g(p)\\,\\right]^2 \\label{eq : alphadef}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are , respectively , the  gluon and ghost propagators evaluated  in landau gauge . clearly @xmath2 is a gauge - dependent quantity ; however , notice that @xmath2 is renormalization - group invariant in landau gauge since , in this case , @xmath6 .",
    "this running coupling strength enters the quark dyson - schwinger equation directly and can be interpreted as an effective interaction strength between quarks @xcite .",
    "studies of the coupled set of dyson - schwinger equations for the gluon and ghost propagators have shown that : ( i ) the gluon propagator behaves as @xmath7 in the infrared limit [ and thus @xmath8 if @xmath9 , ( ii ) the ghost propagator behaves as @xmath10 at small momenta and ( iii ) the running coupling strength @xmath11 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphadef ] ) has a finite value @xmath12 at zero momentum ( infrared fixed point ) . using different approximations , in order to solve the dyson - schwinger equations , the following values have been obtained : @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite . [ here , the first two results refer to @xmath19 . ]",
    "we stress that the large value for @xmath12 obtained in @xcite is related to the angular approximation used in the integration kernels .",
    "let us notice that , using stochastic quantization @xcite , zwanziger also obtained that the transverse gluon propagator in the infrared limit behaves as @xmath20 with @xmath21 .    from the lattice point of view",
    "we know that lattice gauge - fixed landau configurations belong to the region @xmath22 delimited by the first gribov horizon , and that @xmath23 is not free of gribov copies .",
    "one can also prove @xcite that the restriction of the path integral to the region @xmath23 implies a suppression of the ( unrenormalized ) transverse gluon propagator @xmath4 in the infrared limit .",
    "at the same time , the euclidean probability gets concentrated near the gribov horizon and this implies enhancement of @xmath5 at small momenta @xcite .",
    "simulations have been done in so carlos for @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and in tbingen for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the simulations carried out in tbingen are based on a direct evaluation of the form factors @xmath31 and @xmath32 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphadef ] ) .",
    "also , for the evaluation of @xmath33 , the gluon field has been defined in terms of the adjoint links @xcite instead of the usual link variables .",
    "the gluon field obtained in this way is invariant under non - trivial @xmath34 transformations .      in order to compare lattice data obtained for the two propagators at different @xmath1 values we used a standard scaling analysis @xcite based on maximum overlap without considering any phenomenological fit functions .",
    "( details will be presented in @xcite . ) also , for the data produced in so carlos , we have discarded data points at small momenta that are affected by finite - size effects .",
    "( these finite - size effects are less pronounced when one evaluates the form factor directly . )",

    "note that , in the first case , the fitting functions correspond to @xmath42 , while in the second case one has @xmath43 and @xmath44 . also , both sets of fitting functions satisfy the leading ultraviolet behavior of the two propagators .            results of the fits are reported axis in figs .
