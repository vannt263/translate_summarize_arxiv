    "the gauge - gravity interaction has recently attracted attention partly because of the running gauge coupling due to gravity @xcite and partly because of charged black holes and ads / cft .",
    "it is a challenging task even to compute all one - loop diagrams for the gauge - gravity interaction .",
    "the quantum states of charged black holes have been studied mostly near the horizon and at the spatial infinity .",
    "the complete information of quantum states in a background gauge field and/or curved spacetime may help one understanding the vacuum polarization and vacuum persistence , the heisenberg - euler and schwinger effective action @xcite being the most well known in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "the quantum states of a charged particle coupled to an electromagnetic field may be found in a special class of spacetime , which has a certain symmetry respected by the electromagnetic field .",
    "the solutions by kim and page @xcite for a charged boson in a uniform electric field in the global coordinates of two - dimensional de sitter ( ds ) and anti - de sitter ( ads ) spaces are such an exactly solvable model .",
    "there the spacetime has constant curvature , and the uniform electric field respects the symmetry of the spacetime .",

    "thus the bogoliubov coefficients are important in calculating the effective action as well as the schwinger pair production .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the schwinger pair production and the vacuum persistence under the uniform electric field in @xmath1 and @xmath2 by recalculating the bogoliubov coefficients using the solutions in ref .",
    "for that purpose , we employ the in - vacuum and the out - vacuum in the @xmath5 space as defined by mottola , in which the vacua are the no - particle state with respect to the positive frequency solution in each asymptotic region @xcite .",
    "the procedure is similar to the sauter - type time - dependent electric field in the minkowski spacetime @xcite . for the @xmath6 space we use the vacuum in the stckelberg - feynman picture that resolves the klein paradox from a tunneling barrier @xcite , which has an analog of the sauter - type space - dependent electric field in the minkowski spacetime @xcite .",
    "the schwinger pair production in @xmath1 reduces to the particle production in the global coordinates in the zero - field limit @xcite , and both pair productions in @xmath1 and @xmath2 reduce to the schwinger formula in the zero - curvature limit @xcite .",
