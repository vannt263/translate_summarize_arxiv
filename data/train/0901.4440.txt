    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ( @xmath10 ) is one of the most precise test of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions differ from the experimental result for more than @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in the theoretical prediction comes from the hadronic contribution , @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "this contribution can not be reliably calculated in the framework of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , because low - energy region dominates , but it can be estimated by dispersion relation using the experimental cross sections of @xmath8 annihilation into hadrons as an input  @xcite . about @xmath13 of the hadronic part of the muon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath12 , comes from the energy region below @xmath14 gev and , due to the presence of the @xmath15-meson , the main contribution to @xmath12 is related with the @xmath16 final state .    experimentally , the energy region from threshold to the collider beam energy is explored at the @xmath3-factory da@xmath3ne , @xmath17 and @xmath18 at @xmath19-resonance using the method of radiative return ( for a review see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this method relies on the factorization of the radiative cross section into the product of the hadronic cross section times a radiation function @xmath20 known from quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite . for two pions final state",
    "it means that , in the presence of only the initial state radiation ( by leptons , isr ) , the radiative cross section @xmath21 corresponding to the process @xmath22 can be written as @xmath23 @xcite , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the minimal and maximal azimuthal angles of the radiated photon , @xmath26 and the hadronic cross section @xmath27 is taken at a reduced cm energy .",
    "the final state ( fs ) radiation ( fsr ) is an irreducible background in radiative return measurements of the hadronic cross section @xcite and spoils the factorization of the cross section . in any experimental setup",
    "the process of fsr can not be excluded from the analysis .",
    "the kloe experiment has developed two different analysis strategies : the first one is with the photon emitted at small angle ( @xmath28 ) and the other one is for the photon reconstructed at large angle ( @xmath29 ) , being for both @xmath30 . in the case of the small angle kinematics the fsr contribution",
    "can be safely neglected , while for the large angle analysis it becomes relevant ( upto @xmath31 of isr ) .",
    "the large angle analysis allows to scan the pion form factor down to the threshold  @xcite .",
    "radiative corrections ( rc s ) related to initial state radiation , i.e. the function @xmath32 , can be safely computed in qed . for the fsr process",
    "the situation is different . in the region below @xmath33",
    "gev the pqcd is not applicable to describe fsr and calculation of the cross section relies on the low energy pion  photon interaction model .",
    "thus the measured fsr cross section gives an unique possibility to get very interesting information on the dynamics of interacting mesons and photons , to test the pion ",
    "photon interaction models and extract their parameters  @xcite .    in the case of neutral pions in the final states",
    "@xmath34 the isr contribution is absent , and the cross section is determined solely by the fsr mechanism .",
    "this process , together with asymmetries  @xcite and cross section in the charged channel , allows to extract information on pion - photon interaction and test effective models for fsr .    for realistic experimental cuts on the angle and energy of the final particles",
    "the cross section can not be evaluated analytically and one has to use monte carlo ( mc ) event generator .",
    "the first mc describing the reaction ( [ process_charged ] ) was eva @xcite .",
    "eva simulates both isr and fsr processes for non zero angle emitted photon ( @xmath35 ) . for fsr the sqed model was chosen .",
    "afterwards the mc phokhara was written to include different charged final state and radiative corrections to isr @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath2meson direct decay , that is relevant at the da@xmath3ne energy , was added , firstly in eva  @xcite and then in phokhara  @xcite .",

    "this program was inspired by eva .",
    "the present version of fasterd includes different mechanisms for the @xmath4 production : final bremsstrahlung in the framework of both resonance perturbation theory and sqed , the contributions related to the @xmath2 intermediate state and the double vector resonance part ( for details see section  [ fsr_model ] ) . up to now",
    "only the case of one photon emission has been considered .",
    "the code contains two types of source files : ( 1 ) the main program * fasterd.f * , where the calculations are done , and ( 2 ) the input file * cards_fasterd.dat * which defines the parameters for the generation .",
    "both these files will be described in the following .",
    "as output of the program , the cross section of the process is evaluated and a paw / hbook ntuple is produced with the 4-momenta for each event of the outgoing particles . for the convenience of the user",
    "we have added a makefile and the test output files for the journal library .",
