    "the discovery of graphene ,  @xcite a material with a linear low - energy spectrum , generated new interest in the quantum hall effects governed by relativistic particles .",
    "unusual quantum hall resistance plateaus were observed in graphene .",
    "@xcite later experiments reported new , more detailed , features such as the splitting of the zeroth landau level ( ll ) due to breaking of the valley and spin degeneracies .",
    "@xcite    disorder in experimentally available honeycomb graphene lattices is inevitable , whether it is structural like reconstructed and non - reconstructed vacancies , substituted carbon atoms , or it originates from charged impurities such as adatoms .",
    "therefore , disorder in graphene is a very active area of research , both experimentally , in devising ways to characterize it ,  @xcite and theoretically in studying its influence on electron transport ,  @xcite with even possible applications in future spintronic devices .",
    "@xcite due to the relativistic nature of its charge carriers , disordered graphene offers a tabletop environment for the study of previously experimentally unaccessible phenomena , such as for example the atomic collapse reported recently in charged vacancies in graphene .",
    "@xcite vacancy disorder in case of a zero external magnetic field was extensively studied in refs .  , where new states localized around missing carbon atoms were reported .",
    "effects of vacancies in the quantum hall regime were studied in refs .  , which reported on the occurrence of a zero - resistance quantum hall plateau , and breaking of the landau level degeneracy .",
    "graphene with on - site potential disorder was also used in ref .   to test a new numerical approach to calculate the kubo conductivities .    in this paper",
    ", we simulate the transport of electrons in a hall bar made from a single layer of graphene .",
    "our main goal is to study the influence of various types of vacancy disorder on the electron transport in the quantum hall regime .",
    "we report that vacancy disorder can cause the appearance of new states in the landau spectrum , which are observable in the bend resistance , as well as in the total density of states ( dos ) and in the distributions of eigenenergies in a closed system ( a system detached from the leads ) . for monovacancies ,",
    "the energies of these new states scale as the square root of the magnetic field , similarly to the energies of relativistic landau levels , but with a different scaling coefficient .",
    "the local density of states ( ldos ) reveals a strong localization around the monovacancy sites , with localization length proportional to the cyclotron radius .",
    "the localization on divacancies is somewhat different : their localization energy scales linearly with the magnetic field , while their localization radius appears to be constant .",
    "we further study how the electron current flows in the presence of vacancies , and what are the effects of the next nearest neighbor interaction ( nnn ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ s : sys ] we describe our system and methods used to obtain our results . in order to focus on specific aspects of the problem , ranging from vacancy concentration to nnn hopping ,",
    "we discuss our results ( sec .",
    "[ s : res ] ) in several subsections ( from  [ ssdisorder ] to  [ ssnnn ] ) .",
    "all these insights are combined and summarized in the last , concluding section ( sec .",

    "the studied system is shown in fig .  [",
    "f : sys ] , it is a graphene hall bar with zigzag edges along the horizontal leads , and armchair edges along the vertical leads .",

    "before disorder is introduced , all edges are considered to be clean , meaning that there are no dangling bonds on them . ]",
    "we introduce vacancy disorder in this system by randomly removing carbon atoms from the graphene lattice .",
    "three different disorder types are studied , as shown in the right insets in fig .",
    "[ f : sys ] .",
    "the first is a single vacancy / single sublattice disorder ( sva ) . here",
    ", we randomly remove carbon atoms only from one sublattice ( e.g.  sublattice a ) .",
    "the second type is ordinary single vacancy disorder ( sv ) , where carbon atoms are removed without any respect to the sublattice to which they belong .",
    "the third type is a double vacancy disorder ( dv ) , where only pairs of neighbouring atoms , each belonging to a different sublattice , are removed .",
    "it is known that single vacancies ( or monovacancies ) break the sublattice symmetry , while divacancies preserve it . here",
    "we choose two types of monovacancy distributions , since one ( sv ) should preserve the sublattice symmetry on the average , while the other ( sva ) is the extreme case of sublattice symmetry breaking .    when discussing the effects of vacancy disorder , it is important to investigate the general effects introduced by disorder , and to separate them from effects that occur only for some specific disorder distributions .",
    "therefore , we will present two types of results . in order to capture the general disorder effects , for each disorder type and concentration , we perform calculations over a sample of @xmath4 different vacancy distributions . results for specific distributions @xmath5 ( @xmath6 )",
    "are then averaged @xmath7 ( we mark the averaged quantities with a bar line on top ) . on the other hand , in order to better understand the origin of these effects , we often analyze results for some specific distribution , or compare results of several different distributions .    for our numerical calculations we use kwant , a software package designed to simulate electron transport in the quantum regime.@xcite kwant is based on the so - called wave function formulation of the scattering problem , a method which is mathematically equivalent to the non - equilibrium green s function method , but according to ref .",
    "it is numerically more stable .",
    "we define graphene material in kwant using the tight - binding model hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) create ( annihilate ) a @xmath11 electron on the @xmath12-th carbon atom .",
    "no external electric potential is included , except that of the back gate which controls the fermi energy .",
    "the hopping terms @xmath13 and @xmath14 are defined using the electron nearest neighbor hopping energy @xmath15 ev , the nnn hopping term @xmath16 , and the peierls phase factor @xmath17 ( which we discuss below ) .",
    "although most of our results deal only with nearest neighbor interaction , in the last subsection of the next part ( [ ssnnn ] ) we comment on the effects of a nonzero nnn term .    defining a magnetic field in a multi - lead system , where some leads point in different directions , is a problem that needs to be carefully considered .",
    "vector potential along the leads needs to be translatory invariant in order to simulate each lead as a semi - infinite system . following this condition , we set the vector potential in horizontal leads using the landau gauge @xmath18 , and that in vertical leads as @xmath19 . to connect these two ,",
    "the gauge in the main region is set to change smoothly from @xmath20 to @xmath21 in the upper and lower arms of the cross .",
    "this is achieved by using an additional scalar function @xmath22 which rotates the vector potential @xmath23 locally , without changing the orientation and strength of the magnetic field .",
    "this scalar function is defined in ref .   as    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the angle of rotation . in order to apply @xmath22 only in a specific subregion of the cross , we multiply it with a smooth step function , which is nonzero only very close to one of the vertical leads ( here the index @xmath12 specifies the lead number ) .",

    "note that functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 are chosen because they are smooth , thus guaranteeing the smoothness of the vector potential .",
    "but in a tight - binding system , due to its discreteness , and the constant distance between the atoms , this is not a necessary condition .",
    "the discontinuous heaviside step function could also be used instead .",
    "we tested this by changing the width @xmath28 from a value used in all our calculations ( @xmath43 ) , to values well below the carbon - carbon distance ( equivalent to a discontinuous step function ) , with no observable changes in the final results .",
    "the peierls phase factor between sites @xmath12 and @xmath44 , for the modified vector potential is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the peierls phase factor for the translatory invariant landau gauge in the @xmath38 direction @xmath47 as is also explained in ref . .",
    "note that @xmath46 does not depend on the @xmath38 coordinates , since differences @xmath48 are constant .",
    "resistances in this four - terminal device are obtained using the landauer - bttiker formula@xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a resistance measured when the current is injected from lead @xmath51 and collected at lead @xmath52 , and the voltage is measured between leads @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "since vacancy disorder introduces a considerable amount of noise in all calculated quantities , in some cases we perform temperature smoothing by setting , the temperature is considered to be zero otherwise . in case of the averaged results ,",

    "these peaks do not agree with the analytic formula for landau levels given by eq .",
    "( [ landau ] ) .",
    "in contrast , peaks induced by double vacancies ( dv ) appear to agree with eq .",
    "( [ landau ] ) ( i.e.  they correspond to the expected landau levels , broadened by temperature and vacancy scattering ) .",
    "each row in fig .",
    "[ f : rbrh ] presents data for one type of vacancy disorder , for two different concentrations . for each vacancy type ,",
    "the increase in vacancy concentration leads to an increase in @xmath65 , which can be seen in a decreasing scaling coefficient ( given in the insets of the figure ) .",
    "the higher the vacancy concentration , the larger the bend resistance , and consequently the smaller the scaling coefficient . for higher concentrations ( figs .",
    "[ f : rbrh](b ) and ( d ) ) , two peaks in @xmath72 are not well defined , and @xmath75 also slightly deviates from the expected hall plateaus .",
    "although we discuss the effects of a vacancy concentration further below , it is important to state that new peaks in @xmath72 occur only in a certain range of concentrations , and that above some critical concentration , these peaks broaden and merge .",
    "this critical concentration depends on the ratio of the average vacancy - vacancy distance and the magnetic length .",
    "it also depends on the type of monovacancy disorder , since for sva disorder , the two peaks disappear for smaller concentrations ( 0.01% in fig .",
    "[ f : rbrh](b ) ) as compared to sv disorder ( 0.02% in fig .",
    "[ f : rbrh](d ) ) .",
    "another interesting feature is the negative bend resistance in fig .",
    "[ f : rbrh](b ) . as explained in ref .",
    "( page 321 , below eq . 13 in that reference ) , and in ref .",
    "( section 3.4.4.2 in that reference ) , bttiker formula for a four terminal device can produce negative non - local resistances .",
    "this is usually the case when the second term in the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ eqr ] ) is larger than the first term .",
    "we obtain negative @xmath65 peaks for almost all concentrations , but for low concentrations they do not appear often ( because the scattering is weak ) , and are not very pronounced ( they usually disappear after temperature smearing ) . in general , if the number of vacancies exceeds the critical value , vacancy scattering becomes too strong , that no general features exist in the low energy region .",
    "the bend resistance then strongly depends on a particular vacancy distribution .",
    "( color online ) averaged dos ( black curves , arbitrary units ) and distributions of eigenenergies in a closed system ( orange histograms in the background ) .",
    "red lines mark the positions of the two new peaks at , while dotted lines mark the energies of landau levels . similarly to the resistances in fig .",
    "[ f : rbrh ] , for every vacancy type and concentration , dos is first smoothed and then averaged over different vacancy samples . in case of the eigenenergies , results for positive energies for distributions",
    "are summed without smoothing or averaging , and mirrored around @xmath76 axis .",
    "we used the same sets of vacancy distributions as in fig .",

    "magnetic field is , and . ]",
    "another characteristic of the averaged resistance @xmath72 is that it is fairly symmetric with respect to electrons and holes , whereas results for individual distributions ( used to calculate @xmath72 ) are not .",
    "this means that in general , a random monovacancy distribution induces two new peaks in the bend resistance , but the actual relative height of those two peaks depends on a particular arrangement of vacancies .",
    "for some distributions there is only one peak in @xmath65 , at positive or negative energy , and for some distributions there are no peaks at all ( a question which we address in subsection  [ ssrb ] ) .",
    "this asymmetry between electrons and holes is expected , since exchanging electrons for holes is equivalent to flipping the magnetic field , which in turn is equivalent to keeping the field fixed and flipping the system around the @xmath77 axis .",
    "a clean system is symmetric with respect to this transformation , but a disordered system is not . after the flip ,",
    "the incoming electrons see a different arrangement of vacancies .",
    "a vacancy distribution can be constructed to be symmetric with this flip transformation , in which case all results would also be electron - hole symmetric .",
    "this asymmetry between electrons and holes occurs only for a fixed field orientation ( @xmath78 ) , and should not be confused with the case when both magnetic field and fermi energy change sign .",
    "results for electrons and holes are then symmetric : @xmath79",
    ".    results for the averaged total density of states ( dos ) and distributions of eigenlevels in a closed system , presented in fig .",

    "usually , the eigenlevels of a closed system in a high magnetic field tend to cluster around the energies of the landau levels . here",

    "according to refs .",
    ", divacancies in graphene should also induce new states in the landau spectrum .",
    "our results for dv distributions appear to contradict those of these two references . however , a higher resolution dos plot around the zeroth landau level ( shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ldos](a ) ) for one particular dv distribution , reveals additional dos peaks .",
    "these peaks are positioned only few mev away from the lls , and that is why they were not well distinguishable from the lls in the previous results .",
    "this suggests that additional peaks coming from the divacancies would be harder to observe experimentally , since they would be usually smeared by temperature .",
    "previous experiments on graphene in high magnetic fields  @xcite reported splitting of the zero landau level , which was attributed to the breaking of the sublattice symmetry .",
    "one of the possible explanations of the new dos peaks is that they correspond to the occurrence of new states , localized in areas close to the vacancies .",
    "the unsplit zeroth landau level is still present in the dos of the whole device ( for all disorder types ) , since it originates from local density of states ( ldos ) in areas which are vacancy free .",
    "this connection between the new dos peaks and the vacancy localized states becomes apparent if we look at the ldos at one of the two peak energies .",
    "a ldos at one of the two new peaks , for one particular sva distribution , is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ldos](b ) .",
    "ldos is highly localized around the vacancies ( marked with green circles ) . a zoom in fig .  [",
    "f : ldos](c ) shows states localized mostly on one sublattice , which could be connected with the breaking of sublattice symmetry . these states that are localized around single vacancies are the origin of the two new peaks in @xmath65 and dos .",
    "similarly , in figs .",
    "[ f : ldos](d ) and ( e ) we show ldos for one particular dv distribution , at energy of one of the new peaks ( marked with red line in fig .",

    "divacancies also induce localized states , but these states are localized equally on both sublattices , since divacancies do not break the sublattice symmetry . for other energies ( when there is no localization ) , divacancies act similarly to graphene structural armchair edges , namely ldos spreads in areas between them , as if they repel it .",
    "similar behaviour was observed in ref .  .",
    "as stated previously , all these results depend strongly on the vacancy concentration . to illustrate this , we present in fig .  [",
    "f : density ] how dos and ldos change with increasing number of vacancies , belonging to a sv disorder type . here",
    ", we show results for specific vacancy distributions without any temperature smoothing or averaging . for low concentrations ( figs .",

    "other vacancies in fig .",
    "[ f : density](a ) are very close to the system edges , and localization on them is very weak . these results explain why smoothed and averaged @xmath65 and dos exhibit strong peaks around , because this corresponds to the energy of a state localized around one isolated monovacancy .",
    "the localization happens at this specific energy only if a vacancy is in the bulk and sufficiently away from the system edges , but also far from the other vacancies , which is satisfied only for low concentrations . with increasing concentration , the average distance between the vacancies decreases , and vacancies start to `` see '' each other , meaning that they start to influence the formation of localized states on their neighbours .",
    "this is demonstrated in figs .  [",
    "f : density](b ) and  [ f : density](f ) , where several peaks appear in the total dos .",
    "however , the peak at the monovacancy localization energy ( @xmath81 mev ) is still well defined .",
    "this is because there is still one well isolated monovacancy in the upper arm of the cross ( see fig .",
    "[ f : density](b ) ) . for even higher concentrations ,",
    "there are no longer well isolated vacancies , and therefore there is no well defined localization energy .",
    "instead , the monovacancies start to form something which resembles bond states . in a vague analogy with atoms and molecules ,",

[ f : e_vs_b](a ) split into two distributions of peaks . as we explained in the previous subsection , this is mainly due to a decrease of the average vacancy - vacancy distance , and is thus due to an increase of the interference between vacancies , resulting in the formation of bond localized states . since localization radius around a monovacancy is inversely proportional to the square root of the magnetic field ( as we show below ) , the field strength determines how far a single vacancy actually `` sees '' its surroundings , i.e.  it determines the bond length of previously described bond states . because this length changes with magnetic field , various groups of vacancies bond together at different field strengths , and the two distributions of dos peaks in fig .",

    "reference   ( and particularly chapter iv in this reference ) gives a valuable explanation of the qhe in terms of the electron propagation along the sample edges . according to this reference , the rise of longitudinal resistance ( for fermi energies coinciding with the landau levels ) occurs due to the existence of states in the interior of the sample .",
    "these bulk states connect the otherwise separated edges channels , and give rise to their backscattering , and this backscattering manifests in a nonzero longitudinal resistance .",
    "the existence of vacancy localized states in our system , with energies in - between the landau levels , leads to the expected ll broadening .",
    "additionally , these vacancy states can provide a narrow pathway between the channels propagating along the opposite edges of the system . in our particular setup ,",
    "the nonzero @xmath104 term is due to a backscattering between a channel going from the 1st to the 2nd lead ( 1@xmath1092 ) , and the one going from the 3rd to the 4th lead ( 3@xmath1094 ) .",
    "this edge state scattering is responsible for the nonzero bend resistance .",
    "similar analysis can also explain the asymmetry between the resistance results for electrons and holes ( when the field direction is fixed ) . in a clean sample with no vacancies , and for electrons , while and for holes . also for electrons , while for holes .",
    "we already showed that the first term in the bttiker formula ( term @xmath101 in eq .",

    "the bend resistance becomes equal only if we additionally change the magnetic field direction ( from @xmath112 to @xmath113 ) when we switch from electrons to holes .    in summary , although the two new peaks in @xmath65 should in general appear at the vacancy localization energy , they are very sensitive to a particular distribution of vacancies . the vacancies significantly disrupt and divert the current flow . however , if not in @xmath65 , this current guiding will probably manifest itself in measurements of some other non - local resistance .",
    "in this section we study the effects of a nonzero hopping between the second nearest neighbours ( @xmath114 ) .",

    "according to pereira et al .",
    "( refs .  ) , for the @xmath115 case , there are vacancy localized states even when @xmath114 . although the nnn hopping breaks the electron - hole symmetry , the localized states are still preserved . here",
    ", we study the non - zero magnetic field case , and we still observe localization peaks . breaking of the e - h symmetry leads to a displacement of the two peaks , and this displacement ( as we show in fig .",
    "[ f : nnn ] ) depends linearly on the nnn hopping energy @xmath16 .",
    "one of the peaks moves toward the @xmath116 landau level , whereas the other moves to the zeroth landau level .",
    "although the two new peaks are clearly visible in the bend resistance , they are not so distinguishable in the dos .",
    "dos exhibits considerable broadening , and the two peaks are barely visible after temperature smoothing . a closer look in the ldos for @xmath114 ( not shown )",
    "reveals a strong localization on the horizontal , zigzag edges .",
    "this edge localization causes this wide background in dos and masks the narrow vacancy localization peaks .",
    "the linear energy dependence of the new peaks can be further explained if compared with the zero field results of ref .  .",

    "to conclude , we studied electron transport in graphene hall bars in quantizing magnetic fields in the presence of three different types of vacancy disorder .",
    "all three types of vacancy disorder induce new states in the relativistic landau spectrum , but these states behave differently depending on the disorder type .",
    "the new states , localized around monovacancies , are indirectly observable in the bend resistance and in the total dos , but only for vacancy concentrations below a critical concentration .",
    "these states are localized mostly only on one sublattice , but at the localization energy they spread on both sublattices in @xmath97 symmetric , flower - like patterns .",

    "sva disorder , although inducing approximately equal number of states as sv disorder ( compare doss in fig .  [",
    "f : eigen ] for these two disorder types for ) creates considerable different results in the bend resistance .",
    "the origin of these differences is not known , and requires further study .",
    "we speculate that these differences might come from different current flow patterns around different types of vacancy pairs .",
    "for example , ref",
    ".   showed that vacancy coupling does not depend on their type , however , we showed that these states have a certain symmetry , therefore the coupling strength will also depend on direction , and not only on distance .",
    "divacancies also cause localization , but for fields that we consider , their localization energies are much closer to those of the relativistic lls , which makes them harder to observe experimentally .",
    "since they do not break the sublattice symmetry , they are usually @xmath99 symmetric , and they have a constant localisation length .    depending on the ratio between the average vacancy - vacancy distance ( which depends on the vacancy concentration ) and the field strength , localized states around several monovacancies can bond together , forming localized bond states .",
    "these bond states have a localization energy different from that of an isolated monovacancy , but on average they spread equally around this energy .",
    "the localization energy around a single monovacancy is proportional to the square root of the magnetic field , while the localization radius ( and consequently the possible radius of the bond states ) scales with the cyclotron radius .",
    "the behaviour of divacancies is different .",
    "their localization energy scales linearly with the field , and their localization length is independent of the field . based on this , whether they form bond states depends solely on their mutual distance , and not on the field strength .",
    "a decomposition of the bend resistance reveals that only one transmission function ( @xmath104 ) is responsible for the appearance of additional peaks in @xmath65 , which we additionally connect with the vacancy guided current flow inside the system .",
    "all these results are slightly modified when a next - nearest neighbor interaction is included , and the symmetry between electrons and holes is broken .",
