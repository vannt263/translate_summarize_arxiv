    "many zno nanostructures such as nanowires , nanobelts , nanorings and nanohelixes @xcite have been synthesized in recent years , which are expected to be used to make novel electronic devices such as field - effect transistors , nanogenerators and so on .",
    "@xcite viewed from the small scales , these nanostructures are locally wurtzite type . in 2005 ,",
    "_ @xcite found that the graphite - like structure was more energetically favorable than the wurtzite structure for a very thin zno film through the density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "they obtained the critical number of zno monolayers in the thin film to be 18 , beyond which the graphite - like structure would transit to the bulk wurtzite structure @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the present author and hu @xcite pointed out that dft calculations might overestimate the interlayer interactions because the widely used dft packages can not accurately describe the non - covalent bonds .",
    "@xcite the critical number was estimated to be 3 based on some arguments for the interlayer interactions between two zno monolayers and the dft calculations for a single zno monolayer ( szoml ) .",
    "@xcite in 2007 , tusche _ _ et al.__@xcite observed graphite - like zno monolayers in the experiment and found that critical number to be 3 or 4 .    we expect that this new material might have good physical properties .",
    "however , there is very few investigation on this topic except our previous work @xcite on elastic constants and the work @xcite on metallic edges and magnetic behavior in zno nanoribbions . here",
    ", we will address the elastic , piezoelectric , electronic , and optical properties of an szoml with graphene - like structure by first - principles calculations ( the abinit package@xcite ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec - stru ] , we show an optimized structure of the szoml . in section [ sec - phon ]",
    ", we calculate the phonon dispersion relation . in section [ sec - piez ]",
    ", we obtain the elastic and piezoelectric constants based on the relaxed ion model . in section [ sec - elec ] , the electronic band structure and the band gap",
    "are obtained through the dft calculation and gw approximation . in section [ sec - opt ] , we show the results of the optical dielectric functions .",
    "we summarize the main results and infer the possible physical properties of single - walled zno nanotubes based on these main results in section [ sec - condis ] .",
    "the dft calculations @xcite and the experiment @xcite reveal that an szoml with graphene - like structure is chemically stable .",
    "its structure is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fmonolayer ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the two lattice vectors .",
    "each unit cell contains one zn atom and one o atom .",
    "we optimize the structure by taking troullier - martins pseudopotentials , @xcite plane - wave energy cutoff 50 hartree , and @xmath9 monkhorst - pack k - points @xcite in brillouin - zone .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy are treated within the local - density approximation in the ceperley - alder form @xcite with the perdew - wang parametrization .",
    "@xcite we keep the lattice constant in @xmath10-direction 40 bohr such that our result is available for the szoml .",
    "we obtain the two lattice constants in @xmath11-plane @xmath12 bohr ( = 3.208  ) , and correspondingly , the bond length 1.853  , which is close to the previous value @xcite obtained by the present author and hu with different ecut and k - points .",

    ", the phonon dispersion curve of the out - of - plane mode near @xmath0 point has an asymptotic behavior @xmath1 with @xmath16 m@xmath3/s .",
    "the in - plane tangential and radial modes have linear behaviors near @xmath0 point .",
    "the sound velocities are @xmath17 km / s and @xmath18 km / s , respectively , which are much smaller than the corresponding velocities @xmath19 km / s and @xmath20 km / s for graphene .",
    "@xcite here we should emphasize that one can not directly derive the in - plane rigidity and shear modulus from the sound velocities @xmath21 and @xmath22 because the elasticity and piezoelectricity of szoml couples with each other for in - plane deformations . @xcite",
    "but the piezoelectricity and the out - of - plane mode are decoupled .",
    "thus we can derive the bending rigidity @xmath23 of szoml from @xmath24 .",
    "the relation between them is @xmath25 where @xmath26 kg / m@xmath3 is the density ( i.e. , mass per area ) of szoml .",
    "then we obtain @xmath27 ev , which is much smaller than the bending rigidity ( 1.62 ev)@xcite of graphene .",

    "we have mentioned that the elastic constants of szoml can not be directly derived from the phonon dispersion relation because the coupling between elasticity and piezoelectricity .",
    "however , we can directly calculate the elastic and piezoelectric constants by using the abinit package . because the szoml has threefold rotation symmetry around @xmath10-axis and a reflection symmetry with respect to the @xmath28-axis as shown in fig .",

    "( color online ) energy dispersion curves for 9 valence and 5 conduction bands plotted along high symmetry directions in the brillouin zone.,width=283 ]    the large underestimation of the band gap is a well - known problem in dft calculations .",
    "we use the gw approximation @xcite to obtain the correct band gap @xmath54 ev which is larger than the calculated band gap ( 2.6 ev)@xcite of the bulk zno .",
    "thus the szoml can be regarded as a wide band gap semiconductor .",
    "the frequency dependent optical dielectric functions of semiconductor can be computed from the first principles.@xcite in terms of the symmetry of szoml , the non - vanishing dielectric functions are @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , which can be calculated by taking 81 bands , @xmath59 monkhorst - pack k - points , and an `` scissor shift '' 1.813 ev ( i.e. , the correction of band gap obtained from gw approximation ) .",

    "the peaks in the linear optical spectra @xmath64 exist at 3.58  ev , 3.80  ev , 3.93  ev , 4.20  ev , 4.38  ev , 4.52  ev , 4.87  ev , and so on , which can be identified from the band structure .",
    "in particular , the first peak at 3.58  ev marked with an arrow in @xmath64 curve corresponds to the band gap , 3.576  ev , obtained from gw approximation .",

    "\\(ii ) the elastic and piezoelectric constants are @xmath44 ev / zno , @xmath45 ev / zno , and @xmath46 @xmath47/zno .",
    "the szoml is a piezoelectric material .",
    "the in - plane young s modulus , shear modulus , and poisson ratio are calculated as 28.1 ev / zno , 8.2 ev / zno , and 0.71 , respectively .",
    "the out - of - plane rigidity is estimate to be 0.182 ev .",
    "these values reveal that the szoml is much softer than graphene .",
    "\\(iii ) the szoml is a wide band gap semiconductor with electronic band gap 3.576 ev .",
    "this value corresponds to the first peak in the linear optical spectra @xmath64 .",
    "we hope these results can be verified by experiments in the future .",
    "these main results also help us to infer the possible physical properties of single - walled zno nanotubes ( swzonts ) .",
    "interestingly , there are a lot of first - principles investigations on the elastic , electronic , and optical properties of swzonts @xcite although they have not been synthesized yet .",
    "the geometrical construction of swzonts from szoml was discussed in the previous work .",
    "@xcite here we make some predictions on the physical properties of swzonts as follows .",
    "\\(i ) in terms of our experience on the elasticity of graphene and carbon nanotubes , @xcite the in - plane young s modulus , poisson ratio and out - of - plane bending rigidity of swzonts should be similar to those of szoml , which is weakly dependent on the chirality of the swzonts .",
    "\\(ii ) the piezoelectricity depends on the chirality of swzonts viewed from the symmetry .",
    "zigzag nanotubes possess the largest piezoelectricity while armchair nanotubes have no piezoelectricity .",
    "\\(iii ) through zone folding method , @xcite we can obtain most of phonon dispersion curves of swzonts from the phonon dispersion relation of szoml . in particular , the sound velocity of twisting mode of swzonts is about @xmath4 km / s because this mode corresponds to the in - plane tangential acoustic mode of szoml .",
    "\\(iv ) through zone folding method , @xcite we can obtain the electronic band structure of swzonts from the band structure of szoml . because the szoml is a wide band gap semiconductor , swzonts should also be wide band gap semiconductors although the band gap depends on the their chirality .",
    "this point supports the result obtained by elizondo and mintmire , @xcite but not that by erko and kkten .",
    "@xcite thus electronic property of swzonts is quite different from that of single - walled carbon nanotubes @xcite which can be metallic or semiconducting .",
