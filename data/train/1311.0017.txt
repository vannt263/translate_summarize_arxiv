    "the complete proof of the inequality is presented in methods .",
    "* examples . * the inequality ( [ eq : dandv ] ) resembles that for a spinless particle given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spinless ] ) , but the concept of generalized visibility covers a much wider range of physical scenarios . in order to illustrate its breadth ,",
    "let us consider here three cases .",
    "first , when no interaction with the environment occurs , @xmath27 . in this case",
    "@xmath28 , i.e.  no matter what internal states for individual paths are initially chosen , the environment does not gain any which - way information .",
    "second , let us take @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a fixed unit - trace hermitian operator .",
    "physically , this occurs when the internal degree of freedom is entirely transferred to the environment and replaced with a state @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath31 which is the standard expression for quantum fidelity@xcite between density operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 . consequently , the only way to ensure that no which - way information leaks out is to associate both the interferometer paths with identical internal states .",
    "finally , suppose that @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes transposition .",
    "this channel gives @xmath36 .",
    "the resulting expression has non - intuitive properties : for a particle prepared in any pure state @xmath37 the generalized visibility equals @xmath38 , which is strictly less than one for a non - trivial spin subsystem when @xmath39 .",
    "generalized visibility reaches one only when the two paths are associated with maximally mixed spin states , @xmath40 , which follows immediately from the inequality between arithmetic and quadratic means .",
    "this indicates that which - way information deposited in the environment may be erased by introducing classical noise in the input state of the spin subsystem . to illuminate this point ,",
    "let us take a single photon traveling through a mach - zehnder interferometer and consider its polarization , spanned by two orthogonal states @xmath41 and @xmath42 , as the two - dimensional internal degree of freedom .",
    "let the interaction of the photon with the environment be given by a unitary map    @xmath43 \\label{eq : channelexplicit}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , are four orthogonal states of the environment and @xmath46 , @xmath47 are the probability amplitudes in the rectilinear basis .",
    "it is easy to verify that this map indeed induces @xmath48 , while the polarization state in an individual arm is scrambled to a completely mixed state , @xmath49 .    if we prepare @xmath50 , the two states of the environment correlated with the paths : @xmath51 are partly distinguishable .",
    "similarly , for the vertical input polarization , @xmath52 , the environment states are @xmath53 however , if the input polarization is prepared in a completely mixed state @xmath54 , one sees immediately that both the paths are associated with the same mixed environment state @xmath55 and which - way information is not available anymore .",
    "the inequality ( [ eq : dandv ] ) demonstrates that this effect is an intrinsic feature of the channel under consideration rather than its specific realization given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : channelexplicit ] ) .    * estimating generalized visibility . * generalized visibility @xmath21 is given by a rather intricate expression involving the spin preparation and the effective quantum channel experienced by the particle . in principle",
    ", full information about the channel can be obtained from quantum process tomography,@xcite but this approach may be resource consuming , especially for a high dimension of the internal subsystem @xmath6",
    ". we will now give a recipe to construct estimates for @xmath21 from direct visibility measurements for specific spin preparations and selections of individual spin components before interfering the particle paths .",
    "consider the following procedure .",
    "the particle is prepared in one of states @xmath56 where the normalized kets @xmath57 and @xmath58 describe the spin state in the upper and lower interferometer path .",
    "the index @xmath59 labels different preparations . after the interaction with the environment ,",
    "the spin subsystem is filtered individually in each interferometer arm to extract probability amplitudes corresponding to normalized spin states @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "the probabilities of detecting the particle at the two output ports @xmath63 of the beam splitter read @xmath64.\\ ] ] here @xmath65\\ ] ] is the overall probability of detecting the particle in the filtered components .",
    "the modulation depth of interference fringes is characterized by the fractional visibility , given explicitly by @xmath66 for the quantities introduced here , we always have @xmath67 .",
    "full - depth modulation of fringes is observed for the equality sign .",
    "let us now take any set of complex coefficients @xmath68 such that a linear combination of rank - one operators @xmath69 can be written as @xmath70 for a certain operator @xmath71 acting on the duplicated spin subsystem that satisfies @xmath72 .",
    "we show in methods that under these assumptions the generalized visibility is bounded by a linear combination of fractional visibilities with the same coeffcients @xmath68 : @xmath73 combining this result with eq .",
    "( [ eq : dandv ] ) yields a family of bounds on distinguishability in the form @xmath74     in the upper arm and @xmath75 in the lower arm . after interaction with the environment described by the channel @xmath16 the phase between interferometer arms",
    "is modulated by @xmath62 .",
    "next , the spin states are filtered in the orthonormal bases @xmath76 for the upper arm and @xmath77 for the lower arm , and individual components are interfered pairwise to determine fractional visibilities @xmath78.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    special cases of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dlesum ] ) are intuitive .",
    "consider a scenario shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : singlepreparation ] .",
    "we use only a single preparation @xmath79 ( henceforth in this example we drop the superfluous label @xmath59 ) , while the sets of filter states in the upper @xmath80 and lower @xmath81 arm form two orthonormal bases for the spin subsystem with @xmath82 indexing the basis elements . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumklalphas ] ) we can take arbitrary phase factors as coefficients @xmath83 , with the operator @xmath84 satisfying the condition @xmath72 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : genvisbound ] ) we have @xmath85 , which maximized over phases @xmath86 estimates the generalized visibility by a sum of absolute values of fractional visibilities : @xmath87 if for each filter we measure the maximum possible fractional visibility @xmath88 , the right hand side of ( [ eq : visorthogonal ] ) becomes one , because completeness of the bases @xmath80 and @xmath81 implies that @xmath89 .",
    "in other words , when the interaction with the environment introduces different phase shifts between distinguishable components of the spin subsystem but maintains overall coherence between the paths , we can observe full visibility by suitably sorting spin components at the output and interfering them pairwise .",
    "this suffices to verify that no which - way information is deposited in the environment .",
    "however , as noted earlier the interplay between the path and the spin subsystems can exhibit more intricate behaviour .",
    "we illustrate this point with a single photon experiment .    * experiment . * in order to expose more complex aspects of the trade - off between which - way information and interference visibility for a particle with an internal structure , we investigated experimentally interference of a single photon in a noisy mach - zehnder interferometer shown in fig .",

    "an entanglement - based analog of the scenario analyzed above would be to prepare jointly two particles in a maximally entangled path - spin state and to subject one of them to interaction with the environment modelling an eavesdropping attempt . in this case , spin can play the role of a `` shield '' subsystem fully protecting the privacy of a cryptographic key generated by detecting particles in individual paths , even though the noise present in the bipartite state may prevent entanglement distillation at the same rate as key generation.@xcite to complete the parallel , estimates for generalized visibility determined from fractional visibility measurements can be viewed as a dynamical analog of recently introduced privacy witnesses.@xcite",

    "<S> , the interaction with an environment that acquires which - way information can transform in a non - trivial manner the joint path - spin state of the particle . </S>",
    "<S> this opens up an interesting question of how to infer the amount of which - way information deposited in the environment from visibility measurements . </S>",
    "<S> another issue is , to what extent manipulating the spin subsystem can control the information about the path taken by the particle .    </S>",
    "<S> a common approach to quantify the amount of which - way information is to use distinguishability @xmath0 , defined as the maximum difference between the probabilities of correct and incorrect identification@xcite of the path taken by the particle inside the interferometer , based on the state of the environment . </S>",
    "<S> we assume here that both paths are equiprobable . in the spinless case , </S>",
    "<S> the ability for the particle distributed between two paths to interfere is characterized by the visibility @xmath1 , which measures the modulation depth of interference fringes after the paths are combined at the interferometer exit . </S>",
    "<S> these two quantities are related by the inequality@xcite @xmath2    when the particle travelling through the interferometer has an internal structure , the amount of available which - way information depends in principle on the preparation of the spin subsystem and the specifics of the interaction with the environment . </S>",
    "<S> here we demonstrate that in this case the strongest bound on the distinguishability @xmath0 is obtained by replacing @xmath1 with a quantity named generalized visibility that depends on the initial spin preparation and the effective quantum channel experienced by the particle resulting from the interaction with the environment . </S>",
    "<S> further , we present a systematic method to construct estimates for the generalized visibility based on directly measurable quantities , i.e.  interference visibilities for particular spin preparations at the input and selections of spin states before combining the paths at the interferometer exit . </S>",
    "<S> this provides an efficient strategy to find an upper bound on the available which - way information without performing full quantum process tomography.@xcite we illustrate the general results with a proof - of - principle single photon experiment that also demonstrates how which - way information can be erased by introducing mixedness in the spin preparation . </S>"
