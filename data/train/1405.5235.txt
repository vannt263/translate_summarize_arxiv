    "quantum - mechanical effects allow black holes to radiate and therefore  by energy conservation  to lose their mass @xcite .",
    "the flux of radiation emitted by a large black hole of mass @xmath0 as computed by hawking in 1974 is about one hawking quantum with energy @xmath1 per light - crossing time @xmath0 , that is a flux @xmath2 ( we use units @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "the rate of mass loss is therefore @xmath5 when extrapolated to late times , this result implies that the black hole will radiate at an increasingly high rate till its mass vanishes after a finite time @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the initial mass of the black hole .",
    "the radiation emitted by the black hole up to a time @xmath8 is in a mixed state with planckian distribution at the hawking temperature @xmath9 .",
    "the disappearance of the black hole at the end of the evaporation process poses therefore a puzzle , the puzzle of information loss : a pure state of collapsing matter can form a black hole that then evaporates leaving behind only the thermal hawking radiation emitted .",
    "this phenomenon results in a net increase of the von neumann entropy of an isolated quantum system , in contradiction with the _ unitarity _ of quantum mechanics .    despite initial attempts to accommodate the loss of unitarity and predictability in gravitational phenomena @xcite",
    ", it is today widely believed that the evaporation process should be ultimately unitary .",
    "a possible resolution of the paradox is that quantum effects not taken into account in the original hawking calculation provide a resolution of the black hole singularity and a disappearance of the event horizon that protects it . in the absence of an event horizon",
    ", light can eventually escape to infinity and bring all the information needed for the restoration of unitarity . in this scenario",
    "a black hole is a metastable bound state of the gravitational field that traps light for a long but finite time within its apparent horizon .",
    "we assume that the spacetime geometry of such unitary black holes can be described at all times by an effective classical metric with small quantum fluctuations it is immediate to estimate the size of the core of a black - hole - like object with the singularity resolved at a planck - scale energy density : if we concentrate all the mass @xmath0 of the black hole in a core of size @xmath10 we find a density @xmath11 . a planck scale upper bound @xmath12 results in a core of size @xmath13 . for a solar mass black hole",
    "this size is @xmath14 times larger that the planck length @xmath15 and can be described by a classical effective metric . ]",
    "in this situation , the unitarity of hawking evaporation can be phrased and studied using the methods of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes . using these methods",
    "we show that the requirement of unitarity puts strong constraints on the form of the flux of the radiation emitted by the black hole .",
    "in particular we show that  to the extent that the usual two - dimensional reduction is a reliable guide  a unitary evaporation process is always accompanied by negative energy bursts reaching future null infinity .",
    "this phenomenon results in non - monotonic mass loss : an evaporating black hole temporarily increases its mass``gasps''before dying a unitary death .",
    "in an asymptotically flat spacetime , unitarity of the hawking evaporation process can be formulated as an @xmath16-matrix problem . consider a free massless quantum field . at past null infinity @xmath17 , the quantum field",
    "is prepared in the vacuum state @xmath18 .",
    "propagation in a dynamical background results in a new state at future null infinity @xmath19 .",
    "the evolution from @xmath17 to @xmath19 is unitary if the final state is a pure state in the out fock space . in this case",
    "the final state can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the vacuum state at @xmath19 and @xmath22 a unitary operator .",
    "( clearly if an event horizon is present , as in hawking s original derivation , @xmath19 is not a cauchy surface for the massless field , the final state at future null infinity is mixed and unitarity between @xmath17 and @xmath19 is lost .",
    "therefore , we only consider black hole spacetimes with @xmath17 completely determined by data on @xmath19 . )",
    "let us focus on the spherically symmetric case .",
    "we restrict attention to its two - dimensional structure in the time - radial directions , and define an affine parameter @xmath23 on @xmath17 labelling radially ingoing light rays . similarly at @xmath19",
    "we define an affine parameter @xmath24 and use it to label radially outgoing light rays . by demanding that the future - pointing null vectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 have scalar product @xmath27 at spatial infinity . ] infalling light rays that reflect off the center at @xmath28 define a one - to - one mapping between @xmath19 and @xmath17 , @xmath29 the assumption that no event horizon forms corresponds to the _ ray - tracing _ function @xmath30 being onto .    remarkably , the ray - tracing function encodes all the relevant physics of the hawking process @xcite . in particular , the renormalized energy flux at @xmath31 , @xmath32 , is simply given by @xcite @xmath33 where the ` peeling ' function @xmath34 is defined by @xmath35 a steady production of hawking particles corresponds to a regime of approximately constant @xmath34 , i.e. to an adiabatic phase where @xmath36 .",
    "in this regime the hawking particles are distributed according to a planck spectrum with temperature @xmath37 and energy flux @xmath38 . for a collapse that results in a schwarzschild black hole the peeling function",
    "approaches @xmath39 and the standard result for the mass loss eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass - loss - extimate ] ) is reproduced .",
    "unitarity imposes strong conditions on the form of the ray - tracing function @xmath30 of a classical spacetime",
    ". the function must be invertible to avoid the presence of an event horizon , its derivative @xmath40 must go to a constant as @xmath41 to guarantee that the final state @xmath42 is normalizable , and its second derivative ( or more specifically @xmath34 ) must vanish as @xmath41 to ensure that the final state has finite energy @xcite . under these conditions",
    "the final state is pure .",
    "however , much more is generally required of the final state of black hole evaporation .",
    "if a black hole disappears in a finite ( retarded ) time @xmath24 , all the correlations in the quantum field after this time @xmath24 are expected to coincide with the ones of a field in the minkowski vacuum state .",
    "the entanglement entropy of the state @xmath42 at @xmath19 provides a precise measure of these correlations .",
    "we divide @xmath19 in two semi - infinite intervals , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the entanglement entropy of field degrees of freedom between the two parts is defined as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the reduced density matrix @xcite .",
    "this quantity is in general divergent .",
    "similarly to what is done for the flux we introduce a uv regulator and compute the renormalized entanglement entropy defined by the difference @xmath47 .",
    "this difference is finite when the regulator is removed . using the two - dimensional methods introduced in @xcite we recently found that @xmath48 is related to the peeling function by the remarkably simple identity @xcite : @xmath49 at early times , before the evaporation begins , the entanglement entropy matches the one of the minkowski vacuum state , @xmath50 in the adiabatic phase of hawking evaporation the entanglement entropy @xmath48 grows linearly and matches exactly the statistical entropy of a gas of thermal quanta at the hawking temperature .",
    "the purity of the state @xmath42 , however , does not allow the entanglement entropy to grow indefinitely .",
    "in particular the requirement that after the disappearance of the black hole all the quantum correlations are restored to their minkowski value corresponds to the condition smoothly as @xmath41 , i.e. no redshift or blueshift at initial and late times . ] @xmath51 a smooth @xmath48 that starts at zero and returns to zero is often referred to as a `` page curve '' @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for explicit computations of @xmath48 in two - dimensional spacetimes of interest .",
    "the main question addressed in this paper is : what conditions do unitarity and the restoration of minkowski correlations impose on the energy flux @xmath52 emitted by the black hole during its life ?",
    "the physical requirement of energy conservation @xmath53 translates these conditions on @xmath52 into constraints on the mass law @xmath54 of the black hole .",
    "the point of view adopted here is that the energy flux @xmath52 is a given function ( for instance because it has been measured ) and the peeling function @xmath34 is obtained by solving the differential equation .",
    "the question is if this flux is compatible with unitarity , i.e. with a peeling function @xmath34 that vanishes smoothly at infinity .",
    "introducing the ansatz @xmath55 , the riccati equation ( [ eq : riccati ] ) reduces to an ordinary differential equation @xmath56 the schrdinger equation for a zero - energy resonance in the potential @xmath57 the four boundary conditions @xmath58 correspond to perfect transmission and over - constrain the potential ( fig.[fig : gasp ] ) . in particular integrating the differential equation with the boundary conditions ( [ eq : bc ] ) , we find the necessary condition @xmath59    now , using the relations ( [ eq : ds ] ) and ( [ eq : energy - conservation ] ) we can write this expression in terms of the renormalized entanglement entropy @xmath60 and the mass loss of the black hole @xmath61 , yielding @xmath62\\,du\\,=\\,0\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : identity}\\ ] ] this identity is the main result of this paper . in particular for the integral ( [ eq : identity ] ) to vanish the rate of mass loss @xmath61 must change sign at least once : in a unitary evaporation process the mass of the black hole can not decrease monotonically .      s.  w. hawking , `` particle creation by black holes , '' _ commun . math .",
