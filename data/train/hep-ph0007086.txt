    "in @xmath10 decay , it is important to be able to evaluate future measurements of competing observables consistent with the standard model ( sm ) prediction of only a @xmath11 coupling and of only its associated discrete - symmetry violations . for this purpose , without consideration of possible explicit @xmath5 violation , in [ 1 ] plots were given of the values of the helicity parameters in terms of a ",

    "sec.2 , we mean an additional complex - coupling , @xmath16 or @xmath17 , associated with a specific single additional lorentz structure , @xmath4 .",
    "the main motivation for the present analysis are the observed @xmath18 and @xmath19 violations in @xmath20 decay .",
    "although these discrete - symmetry violations are empirically well - described by the ckm matrix which describes the linear superposition of the quark mass eigenstates which appears in the phenomenological weak eigenstates , the fundamental origin of these symmetry violations is still unknown .",
    "experimental results should soon be available about whether the ckm formulation is also successful in b - quark decay . in the case of the strong interactions ,",
    "there is the opposite difficulty of a fundamental strong @xmath18 problem which has led to the prediction of the existence of axions , the nambu - goldstone bosons associated with a global @xmath21 symmetry .",
    "these axions have yet to be discovered .",
    "lastly , and perhaps more significantly for t - quark decay , most astrophysics studies of electroweak baryogenesis conclude that additional sources of @xmath18 violation , beyond ckm , in elementary particle physics are necessary to explain the observed baryon - to - photon ratio .",
    "so in spite of the robustness of the standard model and of the ckm formulation , perhaps after all , t - quark decay is not the wrong place to look for @xmath18 and @xmath19 violations .",
    "a first measurement of the longitudinal w boson fraction was reported in [ 2 ] .",
    "a recent working group review of t - quark physics is in [ 3 ] .",
    "a recent review of @xmath18 violation in t - quark physics is in [ 4 ] . besides these references and those listed in [ 1 ] ,",
    "some of the related recent literature is [ 5 - 14 ] .",
    "the present analysis assumes that future measurements of @xmath22 decay will be at least approximately consistent with the sm prediction of only a @xmath23 coupling .",
    "if the sm is correct , one expects that the @xmath24 and @xmath25 moduli and relative phase @xmath26 will be the first quantities to be somewhat precisely determined . as shown by table 1 ,",
    "the @xmath27 moduli are factors of 30 and 100 smaller in the sm .",
    "the helicity parameters appear directly in various polarization and spin - correlation functions for @xmath28 decay such as those obtained in [ 15 ] . by measurement of independent helicity parameters , or from other empirical analyses of spin - correlation and polarization observables ,",
    "it will be possible to test in several independent ways that the r - handed b - quark amplitudes , @xmath27 , are indeed negligible to good precision .",
    "eventually there should also be direct evidence for their existence if the sm is correct .",
    "if the r - handed amplitudes are negligible , then besides @xmath29 it follows that @xmath30 and that @xmath31 .",
    "showing an approximate empirical absence of r - handed amplitudes would also be useful in regard to tests for @xmath15 violation : assuming that the l - handed amplitudes dominate , the @xmath32 helicity parameter satisfies the relation @xmath33 @xmath34[p(b_{l})-\\zeta ] -($ ] @xmath35 .",
    "for instance , in the sm the vanishing of the right - hand - side is due to the vanishing of @xmath36 provided that the r - handed amplitudes are negligible .",
    "if @xmath15 violation were to occur , besides normally a non - zero approximate - equality in the above relation , there would normally also be a non - zero @xmath37 if the r - handed amplitudes are negligible .    * remarks on the dynamical phase - type ambiguities : *    due the dominance of the l - handed amplitudes in the sm , the occurrence of the two dynamical ambiguities [ 1 ] displayed in lower part of table 1 is not surprising because these three chiral combinations only contribute to the l - handed b - quark amplitudes in the @xmath38 limit . since pairwise",
    "the couplings are tensorially independent , the @xmath39 and @xmath40 mixtures can each be tuned by adjusting a purely real @xmath14 to reproduce , with opposite sign , the sm ratio of the two @xmath41 l - handed amplitudes . likewise , if experimental data were to suggest that the r - handed amplitudes are larger than expected , e.g. @xmath42 , this might be due to the presence of additional @xmath43 type couplings .",
    "since the @xmath44 couplings only contribute to the longitudinal helicity w amplitudes , they might be of interest in the case of an unexpected w longitudinal / transverse polarization ratio .",
    "versus the upper part of table 1 , given the small @xmath45 mass , this is the reason that the sign of the @xmath46 amplitude can be switched , without other important changes , by the addition of the @xmath47 coupling .",
    "however , in the case of the @xmath48 phase - type ambiguity , from table 1 there are 3 numerical puzzles versus the sm values . in the upper part",
    ", the @xmath49 amplitude for @xmath50 has about the same value in @xmath51 units , as the @xmath52 amplitude in the sm . as @xmath38 , @xmath53 .",
    "the other numerical puzzle(s ) is the occurrence in the lower part of the table 1 of the same magnitude of the two r - handed b - quark amplitudes @xmath54 for the sm and for the case of @xmath55 . except for the differing partial width , by tuning the magnitude of l - handed amplitude ratio to that of the sm ,",
    "the r - handed amplitude s moduli also become about those of the sm .",
    "with @xmath56 determined as in sec .",
    "3 , for the @xmath57 amplitudes @xmath58 versus for instance @xmath59 .",
    "of course , the row with sm values is from a  theory \" whereas the row of @xmath50 values is not .",
    "nevertheless , dynamical ssb and compositeness / condensate considerations do continue to stimulate interest [ 15 ] in additional tensorial @xmath60 couplings . in table 1 , due to the additional @xmath61 coupling , the net result is that it is the @xmath62 helicity amplitudes @xmath57 which get an overall sign change .    fortunately , a sufficiently precise measurement of the sign of @xmath63(sm ) due to the large interference between the w longitudinal / transverse amplitudes can resolve the @xmath64 and @xmath61 lines of this table .",
    "similarly , sufficiently precise measurements of both @xmath65 and @xmath66 could resolve the analogous dynamical ambiguity in the case of a partially - hidden @xmath15 violation associated with the additional @xmath67 coupling , see figs.8 in sec .",
    "3 . a precise measurement of the partial width",
    "@xmath68 could also be useful .",
    "for 1em @xmath0 , the most general lorentz coupling is @xmath69 where @xmath70 , and @xmath71 @xmath72 in this paper , in consideration of the additional lorentz structures to pure @xmath64 , we consider the @xmath73 or @xmath14 as complex phenomenological parameters . for @xmath74 units with @xmath75 ,",
    "the nominal size of @xmath14 is @xmath76 , see [ 1 ] . in the sm , the ew energy - scale is set from the higgs - field vacuum - expectation - value by the parameter @xmath77 and @xmath78 a specific discrete symmetry implies a definite symmetry relation among the associated helicity amplitudes . in the case of @xmath5 invariance , the respective helicity amplitudes must be purely real , @xmath79 @xmath80 intrinsic and relative signs of the helicity amplitudes are specified in accordance with the standard jacob - wick phase convention . @xmath15",
    "invariance will be violated if either ( i ) there is a fundamental violation of canonical  time reversal \" invariance , or ( ii ) there are absorptive final - state interactions . in the sm , there are no such final - state interactions at the level of sensitivities considered in the present analysis . to keep this assumption of  the absence of final - state interactions \" manifest",
    ", we refer to this as @xmath5 invariance , see [ 15 ] and references therein",
    ". if experimental evidence for @xmath15 violation were found , it would be very important to establish whether ( i ) , ( ii ) , or some combination of the two effects was occurring .",
    "for instance , unexpected final - state interactions might be associated with addition t - quark decay modes .    to assess future measurements of helicity parameters in regard to @xmath15 violation , figs . 1 - 5 , are for the case of a single additional pure - imaginary coupling , @xmath2 or @xmath81 , associated with a specific additional lorentz structure , @xmath82 . in the sm ,",
