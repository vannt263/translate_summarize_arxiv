    "unfortunately , neither of these schemes lends itself to a uniform lattice potential for atoms : the radio - frequency scheme fails because it is limited to one - dimensional periodic potentials and the two - frequency balancing because lattice periodicity depends on wavelength @xcite .    in this paper",

    "we note that in table  [ tab : rb87 ] the tune - out wavelength for linear polarization is nearly independent of the choice of ground state , in contrast to @xmath61 or @xmath62 polarizations .",

    "since the scattering rate in the tune - out scheme can be smaller for elements with larger fine structure splittings , this approach is better suited to more massive elements @xcite .",

    "an isotope mixture of potassium could be compatible with the tune - out scheme , where @xmath82 100 ms .",
    "isotope - specific manipulation within a lithium mixture is less practical due to sustainabilities of 1 ms or less .",
    "other factors may also influence whether the tune - in or tune - out approach is preferred . for experiments with time scales that are slow compared to the thermalization rate ( discussed further in sec .",
    "[ sec : rethermalization ] ) , it may be preferable to heat the minority species and allow for sympathetic cooling .",
    "if the reservoir of spectator atoms is large , the tune - in scheme might be preferred since extra energy due to near - resonant heating would be transferred to the reservoir . for experiments on time scales",
    "fast compared to the thermalization rate , the tune - out scheme might be preferred even if is smaller , since spectator heating will not affect the target .",

    "a - c we have discussed the ratio of induced potential to heating rate as a local quantity .",
    "however , the spatial dependence of intensity in an optical lattice means that moving atoms may not sample all laser intensities uniformly and the heating rate should be modified accordingly",
    ". a more relevant characterization of trapping and dissipation is @xmath83 where the brackets indicate expectation values and @xmath84 is the maximum potential depth of the target . in the case where only one heating rate dominates ,",
    "we define a quantity @xmath85 to represent the enhancement of sustainability due to the lattice : @xmath86 where the expectation value is taken for the spectator species in the tune - out case , and for the target in the tune - in case . in a one - dimensional lattice ,",
    "the intensity is @xmath87 , where @xmath88 .    for the tune - out scheme , neither the position nor the motion of the spectator",
    "is coupled to the standing wave intensity .",
    "we can assume that all intensities are equally sampled and use the average intensity ; @xmath89 to give @xmath90 .",
    "for the tune - in scheme , the target is the species for which the heating rate is dominant and for which the lattice enhancement of the sustainability must be taken into account .",

    "interactions between elements may couple the environment felt by the target to the spectator , spoiling the species - specific potential shaping of both schemes .",
    "if target atoms are trapped in a lattice in the presence of a background spectator species , a periodic interaction potential could arise for the spectator due to its interaction with the periodically modulated density of the target .",
    "a mean - field approach is used to make a simple estimate of the magnitude of this effect .",
    "the interaction potential of the spectator due to the target is given by @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the scattering length between species , @xmath109 is the density of the target , and @xmath110 is the reduced mass . as @xmath111 , interaction effects begin to degrade selectivity . estimating the three - dimensional density of the target at the centre of a single lattice site using the harmonic oscillator ground state with frequency @xmath112 and assuming one atom per site",
    ", we find an interaction - limited selectivity @xmath113 in the case of the @xmath114-@xmath2 target - spectator mixture , the interaction - limited selectivity is @xmath115 @xcite , while for the @xmath3-@xmath2 target - spectator mixture , it is @xmath116 . to be in a regime where interaction effects might be ignored ,",
    "we require @xmath117 which gives @xmath118 for @xmath114-@xmath2 and @xmath119 for @xmath3-@xmath2 . while for the lithium target , this condition is quite reasonable , the large lattice depths required for potassium would completely localize the atoms to individual sites and prevent the exploration of interesting tunneling - driven physics . overcoming this interaction limitation and achieving the high selectivity discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : schemes ] may be possible by tuning a magnetic field to a value where @xmath120 near a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "for instance , with depth @xmath121 and @xmath122 , the scattering length between species is limited to @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the bohr radius .    where species selectivity is not the goal , this interaction - induced periodic potential for a second species could be used alternative lattice potentials . such potentials are non - sinusoidal , do not involve a stark shift , and may have a dynamic structure if target atoms are mobile",
    ". the strength of this induced potential could be controlled through the interaction strength , such as at a feshbach resonance , as described above .",
    "an understanding of the thermalization between species is important when considering heating or cooling in the trap .",
    "the rate at which energy is transferred between the species will be relevant in setting the time scales on which adiabatic experiments can take place .",
    "thermometry is also possible if there is good thermalization between species ; a high density target could be confined within a species - specific lattice while the spectator remains extremely dilute and thus at lower quantum degeneracy , where temperature is more easily measured .",
    "conversely , thermal isolation could be useful in shielding one species from the spontaneous heating in the other .    in the classical limit ,",
    "the thermalization rate is proportional to the collision rate of the atoms in the trap , given by @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the overlap density , @xmath127 the scattering cross - section , and @xmath128 the relative velocity between species .",
    "random collisions act to equilibrate the system and the rate of rethermalization is @xmath129 @xcite .    for a degenerate mixture of bosons and fermions , the classical picture of scattering breaks down and",
    "the rate of thermalization decreases as the fermionic system becomes more degenerate .",
    "an estimate of the sympathetic cooling of a uniform system in the degenerate regime using the quantum boltzmann equations gives the rate of change in the degeneracy @xcite : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the collision rate between species , with the scattering cross - section @xmath132 , fermi velocity , @xmath133 , @xmath134 is the riemann zeta function and @xmath135 is the fermi temperature .",
    "though other assumptions @xcite of this treatment are not valid for the systems we consider in this paper , we use this expression to determine an order of magnitude for the thermalization rate .",
    "taking boson density @xmath136 @xmath137 , fermion density @xmath138 @xmath137 , and using the mass for @xmath3 , we calculate that @xmath139 , which gives a temperature relaxation time of @xmath140 ms at @xmath141 .",
    "this is an order of magnitude larger than the the classical expectation for the rethermalization time of @xmath142 ms for particles moving at the fermi velocity .",
    "thus for rapid experiments in the deeply degenerate regime , thermal contact is essentially broken , allowing , for instance , the target to be unaffected by the heating of the reservoir in the tune - out scheme .",
    "two - species mixtures can be used to realize various cooling schemes .",
    "for example , dark state cooling by superfluid immersion is discussed in ref .",
    "we present two simple cooling scenarios in which the presence of an uncompressed spectator allows the target species to be compressed with negligible temperature increase but significant improvement in phase space density . in both cases , target atoms are first compressed isothermally , spectator atoms are then removed from the trap , and finally , the target atoms are decompressed adiabatically .",
    "we consider a species - selective single well dipole trap and a species - selective lattice .",
    "a closed cycle is described for both scenarios with atoms beginning and ending in a fort .",
    "we assume that the heat capacity ratio between spectator and target is infinitely large and that thermalization in the spectator and between the spectator and target species is faster than any other time scale considered .",
    "the latter assumption may restrict fermion cooling to the non - degenerate regime ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : rethermalization ] ) .        in the first scenario , schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cooling ] , a single species - specific beam crosses a fort .",
    "adiabatic cooling reduces temperature in proportion to the ratio of average trapping frequencies , that is , @xmath143 , where @xmath144 indicate `` initial '' and `` final '' . as an example , consider @xmath3-@xmath2 and @xmath114-@xmath2 mixtures , confined by a 1064 nm , 500 mw single - beam fort with a @xmath145 radius of 20 @xmath79 m and a corresponding trap - averaged harmonic oscillator frequency @xmath146 hz for @xmath3 and @xmath147 hz for @xmath114 .",

    "the rubidium is ejected from the trap by temporarily removing the fort or by using a resonant pulse of light .",
    "the species - specific trap is then adiabatically ramped down and turned off , leaving the fermions in the fort at a temperature approximately 5.7 ( 4.0 ) times colder than when they began for potassium ( lithium ) .",
    "though this is a modest change in temperature , the phase space density in a harmonic trap is proportional to the inverse cube of the temperature , indicating a factor of 180 increase in phase space density for potassium and a factor of 60 for lithium .    in the second scenario , we consider a 3d lattice created by the tune - out wavelength @xcite .",
    "the target - specific lattice is ramped on until peak lattice intensity is reached .",
    "the spectator is evaporatively cooled and ejected by reducing the spectator trap depth .",
    "the lattice is then ramped back down isentropically , leaving the target in the initial trap with an entropy and temperature limited by the `` plateau entropy '' discussed in @xcite .",
    "as shown there , a target of fermions with unity filling has an entropy plateau of zero , which would suggest no lower limit to the achievable temperature .",
    "an important limitation of these schemes will be the competition between adiabaticity and heating .",
    "for an ideal gas , the condition of adiabaticity requires any changes to take place in times longer than the inverse of the smallest trap frequency . using the numbers given in the @xmath3-@xmath2 example of the crossed dipole trap in the tune - out scheme",
    ", we find that adiabaticity requires a relaxation time of 35 ms , at an intensity of 3.5@xmath151 mw/@xmath152 , yielding a heating of 1.3 @xmath79k during this time , which sets a lower bound for the temperature attainable in this scheme .",
    "another possible limitation of the cooling schemes is the interspecies thermalization , which limits the speed of the isothermal step ( see discussion in  [ sec : rethermalization ] ) .      unlike crystal lattices of solids , optical lattices do not support phonons .",

    "species - specific trapping allows the superfluid bosons to remain at low density while fermions are tightly bound in the lattice , thereby maximizing the range of the mediated interaction .",

    "<S> we examine single - frequency optical schemes for species - selective trapping of ultracold alkali - metal atoms . independently addressing the elements of a binary mixture </S>",

    "<S> we analyze a `` tune - in '' scheme , using near - resonant detuning to create a stronger potential for one specific element . </S>",
    "<S> a `` tune - out '' scheme is also developed , in which the trapping wavelength is chosen to lie between two strong transitions of an alkali - metal atom such that the induced dipole moment is zero for that species but is nonzero for any other . </S>",
    "<S> we compare these schemes by examining the trap depths and heating rates associated with both . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the tune - in scheme is preferable for li - na , li - k , and k - na mixtures , while the tune - out scheme is preferable for li - cs , k - rb , rb - cs , k - cs and @xmath0k-@xmath1k mixtures . </S>",
    "<S> several applications of species - selective optical lattices are explored , including the creation of a lattice for a single species in the presence of a phononlike background , the tuning of relative effective mass , and the isothermal increase of phase space density . </S>"
