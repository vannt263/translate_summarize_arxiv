    "the principal aim of this paper is to extract information on the fluxes of be and cno neutrinos directly from solar neutrino experiments , with minimal assumptions about solar models . in this respect",
    ", we will update previous results  @xcite and try to elucidate the role of cno neutrinos .",
    "we will see that experimental data are more and more against the hypothesis of standard neutrinos (  without mass , mixing , magnetic moments ... ) .",
    "next we will compare these informations with solar models , both standard and non standard ones .",
    "clearly , low (  smaller than standard ) central temperature models are ruled out , essentially because they can not reproduce the experimental data available on both be and b neutrinos .",
    "hybrid models , where some suitable nuclear cross section is varied in order to reduce the be neutrinos flux to the observed value and with a higher central temperature , so as to agree with experimental results on b neutrinos flux , can also be excluded , as in these models the cno neutrino flux grows beyond acceptable levels . in other words ,",
    "the bounds on be ( cno ) neutrinos tell us that it is hopeless to reduce ( enhance ) the central solar temperature , in order to stay with standard neutrinos .    in summary",
    ", we shall demonstrate that , under the assumption of standard neutrinos :    * the available experimental results look inconsistent among themselves , even if one of the four experiments were wrong ; * the flux of intermediate energy neutrinos ( be+cno ) as derived from experiments is significantly smaller than the prediction of ssm s ; * the different reduction factors for @xmath0be and @xmath1b neutrinos with respect to the ssm are essentially in contradiction with the fact that both @xmath0be and @xmath1b neutrinos originate from the same parent @xmath0be nucleus .",
    "we will discuss then the expectations for borexino , both in the case of standard and non standard neutrinos , showing that the experiment can clearly discriminate among several possible solutions to the solar neutrino puzzle .     ? = ?",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , < , > , < , < , > , < , < \" , ]",
    "one could imagine the conspiracy of two mechanisms , so as to bring both @xmath2 and @xmath3 in agreement with experiment .",
    "for example , one could assume that @xmath4 is much larger than commonly assumed ( e.g. as a result of a hypothetical resonance  @xcite ) so as to enhance the ppi channel and reduce @xmath2 to the desired value .",
    "at the same time , by varying some suitable parameter the central temperature could be increased , so as to bring @xmath3 in agreement with experiment .",
    "this mechanism also fails  @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , due to the fact that as temperature raises , the cno flux grows as fast as the boron flux , and the experimental bound on @xmath5 is again violated .",
    "in other words , while beryllium and boron neutrinos tell us that one can not hope to solve the neutrino problem by lowering the central temperature , the bound on cno implies that increasing the temperature does not work either .",
    "if instead the temperature is unchanged but @xmath6 is increased , one has still the problem that the ssm prediction for the cno exceeds the experimental constraint , see again fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and ref .",
    "we have seen that , for standard neutrinos , the be - flux is strongly suppressed with respect to the ssm predictions . what has to be expected for non standard neutrinos ?",
    "in table  [ table2 ] we update and extend a recent analysis  @xcite for a few candidate solutions .",
    "we use now as a reference the fluxes corresponding to the `` best model with helium and metal diffusion '' of ref .  @xcite . for active neutrinos ,",
    "both small and large angle msw solutions are acceptable , as well as the just - so model . on the other hand , for sterile neutrinos only msw at small angle",
    "gives a good fit . among these four acceptable solutions , two of them ( msw large angle and just - so )",
    "give signals ( cc+nc ) that are quite a significant fraction of the ssm prediction , see last column in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "in other words , in face of the present experimental data , the beryllium signal does not need to be small , for non standard neutrinos .",
    "the situation is made more clear in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where we show the 90%  c.l .",
    "regions according to the different models .",
    "a direct measurement of the be line can in many cases discriminate among the possibile solutions .",
    "very large signals , above 75% of the ssm prediction , correspond essentially to the just - so solution .",
    "between 75% and about 35% various models are acceptable .",
    "between 35% and 20% the solution has to bee msw at small angle for active neutrinos .",
    "very small signal , say below 20% , are only possible for standard neutrinos , or transitions into sterile neutrinos .",
    "most of the results presented here are the outcome of the fruitful and friendly collaboration in the last few years with v.  berezinsky , v.  castellani , f.  ciacio , s.  deglinnocenti and n.  ferrari .",
    "we are grateful to t.  e.  o.  ericson and to g.  cocconi for useful discussions .",
