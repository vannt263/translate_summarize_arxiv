    "according to the surveys , bl lacertae objects can be divided into radio selected bl lacertae objects ( rbls ) and the x - ray selected bl lacertae objects ( xbls ) . from the spectral energy distribution ( sed )",
    ", one can see that some bl lacertae objects show lower - frequency peaked sed and are called as lbls , while some others show higher - frequency peaked sed and are called as hbls ( see urry & padovani 1995 for a review ) .",
    "generally , xbls correspond to hbls while rbls to lbl .",
    "for mkn 421 and mkn 501 , they are classified as rbls by someone and as xbls by some other authors .",
    "however , from sed , they are both classified as hbls .",
    "the observational properties of rbls are systematically different from those of xbls .",
    "the latter have flatter spectral energy distribution from the radio through x - ray , a higher observed peak of the emitted power from radio through x - ray spectral energy distribution .",
    "furthermore , rbl and xbl show different observation properties(see angel & stockman 1980 ; efimov , et al .",

    ", we will investigate the radio properties of polarization in bl lacertae objects based on the murao data base .",
    "it is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will calculate the averaged polarization and the variation of polarization for rbls and xbls . in section 3 ,",
    "we give some discussion and a conclusion .",
    "from the murao data base , we can get 47 bl lacertae objects , 38 of them are rbls , 7 of them are xbls , two of them ( mkn 421 and mkn 501 ) are intermiddle type . for those sources ,",
    "we did following calculations      for each source , firstly we got its averaged flux densities at three radio frequencies ( 4.8ghz , 8.0ghz and 14.5 ghz ) respectively , then adopted the linear regression analysis to the averaged flux at the three frequencies , we got the fitting result as @xmath0 . therefore , we finally got the spectral index , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the resulting spectral indexes are listed in table 1 , from which , we found that the radio spectral indexes for the 7 xbls are in the range of @xmath1 = -0.188 to @xmath1 = 0.625 with an averaged value of @xmath3 while those for the 38 rbls are in the range of @xmath1 = -0.601 to @xmath1 = 0.757 with an averaged value of @xmath4 .      for the rbls and xbls , we calculated respectively the averaged maximum polarization and the averaged polarization based on the observed polarization of each source .",
    "the detail procedure is as follows . at each frequency for each source , we chose the observed maximum polarization value as the maximum polarization at the corresponding frequency , and calculated the averaged value of the whole observation polarization as the averaged polarization . therefore , we have three maximum polarizations and three averaged polarizations ( at 4.8 , 8.0 and 14.5 ghz ) for each source .",
    "then for each subclass ( xbls and rbls ) , we can calculate the averaged maximum polarization at frequency @xmath5 ( @xmath6 , 8.0 and 14.5 ghz ) , @xmath7 , here @xmath8 is the maximum observed polarization at frequency @xmath5 for the @xmath9th source in the subclass , and @xmath10 is the source number of the subclass . @xmath11 and 38 for xbls and rbls respectively .",
    "the averaged averaged polarization is also calculated as @xmath12 , here @xmath13 is the averaged observed polarization for the @xmath9th source in the subclass .",
    "so , we can get following statistical results .",
    "@xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 for 7 xbls ,    @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 for 38 rbls .      for polarization",
    ", the averaged results suggest that both the maximum and averaged polarizations increase with the radio frequency in the radio range of from 4.8ghz to 14.5ghz .",
    "in addition , within that radio frequency range , both the averaged maximum and the averaged averaged polarization in xbls are higher than those in rbls at the same radio frequency .    for the polarization and the spectral index ,",
    "there is a tendency for the radio polarization to increase with the spectral index for bl lacertae objects as shown in fig .",
    "[ fan-2006-pasj - fg - pa ] .",
    "( 90mm,100mm)fan-2006-pasj - fg - pa.eps    the core - dominance parameter is an important parameter calculated from the radio observation .",
    "it is defined as the ratio of the core flux density to the extended flux density ( orr & browne 1982 ) . for polarization and the core - dominance parameter , we plotted the averaged 8ghz polarization against the core dominance parameter as shown in fig .",
    "[ fan-2006-pasj - fg - pr ] .",
    "( 90mm,100mm)fan-2006-pasj - fg - pr.eps",
    "it is believed that the particular properties observed from bl lacertae objects are associated with the beaming effect , and the beaming model was adopted to explain both the particular observational properties and some observational differences between rbls and xbls ( see fan et al .",
    "1997 ; fan & xie 1996 ; georganopoulos & marscher 1999 ) although the viewing angle alone can not explain all the difference between rbls and xbls ( sambruna et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "high and variable polarization is one of the characteristics of bl lacertae objects . for the radio polarization , although the averaged value indicates that the polarization in xbls is higher than that in rbls , we can get the conclusion that the radio polarization in xbls is not always higher than that in rbls .",
    "the reasons are that 1 ) there are only 7 xbls in our consideration , and 2 ) for the sources with the averaged polarization being higher than 10% , we have two rbls but 6 xbls .",
    "however , for the sources with maximum polarization being higher than 35% , we have 9 rbls but 3 xbls .",
    "we think that whether or not the radio polarization in xbls is higher than that in rbls , more radio polarization observations are significant and encouraged .",
    "when we take into account of the polarization variation , we can use the standard deviation , @xmath26 as the variation indication . in this sense",
    ", we found that the variation is closely linearly correlated with the averaged polarization shown in fig .",
    "[ fan-2006-pasj - fg - pdp ] , the line stands for the best fitting result , @xmath27 .",
    "here we used the data at 8ghz .",
    "( 90mm,100mm)fan-2006-pasj - fg - pdp.eps    when we considered the relationship of polarization on the spectral index , we found that the radio polarization increases with the spectral index , @xmath1 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the data can gave a linear relation of @xmath29 . from the synchrotron emission",
    ", one can get that the polarization is proportional to @xmath30 , which suggests that the polarization is correlated with the spectral index and that the polarization increases with the spectral index .",
    "although our statistical result show a trend that the polarization increase with the radio spectral index as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the trend is largely different from the prediction by synchrotron emission .",
    "polarization is found to be associated with the core - dominance parameter ( see wills et al .",
    "1992 and reference therein ) with high polarization corresponding to large @xmath31 . for the present sample",
    ", one can get a plot of the radio polarization against the core - dominance parameter as shown in fig .",
    "[ fan-2006-pasj - fg - pr ] . in fig .",
    "[ fan-2006-pasj - fg - pr ] , we only showed the averaged radio polarization at 8.0ghz and the core dominance parameters that are available in the literature .",
    "based on the two - component beaming model urry & shafer ( 1984 ) ( see also urry & padovani , 1995 ) , the emissions of an agn are from two components , namely the beamed and the unbeamed ones . assuming the intrinsic flux of the jet , @xmath32 , to be a fraction @xmath33 of the unbeamed flux , @xmath34 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath35 , one can get @xmath36 . if one assumes that the emissions in the co - moving jet are also composed of two components , namely the polarized and the unpolarized , with the two components being proportional to each other , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "then a relation between the observed polarization and the doppler factor can be obtained ( fan et al .",
    "1997 ; see also fan et al .",
    "2001 ) .    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the intrinsic polarization expressed in the form @xmath41 which follow @xmath42 @xmath43 is the doppler factor , @xmath44 is the ratio of the polarized to the unpolarized luminosity in the jets .",
    "the value of @xmath45 depends on the shape of the emitted spectrum and the detailed physics of the jet ( lind & blandford 1985 ) , @xmath46 is for a moving sphere and @xmath47 is for the case of a continuous jet , @xmath1 is the spectral index .",
    "if we use the expression for the core - dominance parameter , @xmath48=@xmath49 $ ] , then the polarization can be written in the form    @xmath50    here , @xmath51 . since the observed",
    "polarization is positive , then we can get the value of @xmath52 to be smaller than the value of r. therefore , the value of @xmath52 is actually very small since the @xmath31 is -0.91 for 1100 + 772 .",
    "so , we have @xmath53 for a given @xmath44 , a theoretical relation of polarization depending on the core - dominance parameter can be obtained . in fig .",
    "[ fan-2006-pasj - fg - pr ] , we showed the polarization vs core - dominance parameter plot .",
    "the core - dominance parameter is taken as the jet viewing indication , it is actually the indication of a beaming effect . for a strongly boosted source",
    ", the core - dominance parameter can be simply expressed as @xmath54 ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1993 ) . in this sense",
    ", one can see clearly that 1 ) the polarization is consistent with the explanation that the polarization is associated with the beaming effect and 2 ) for most sources , their @xmath44 is less than 0.25 .    in this paper , based on the murao data base , we considered the radio polarization for bl lacertae objects and found that the averaged polarization depends on the frequency , the spectral index and the core - dominance parameter .",
    "the polarization variation is closely correlated with the polarization .",
    "the relativistic beaming could explain the polarization characteristic of bl lacs .",
