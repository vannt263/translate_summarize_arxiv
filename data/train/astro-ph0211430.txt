    "fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation can provide information about hot gas in galaxy clusters over a wide range of redshifts ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1972,1980 ( hereafter sz ) , and @xcite ) . on arcminute angular scales and smaller , the thermal sz contribution to the cmb anisotropy is expected to dominate that of the primary anisotropies ( @xcite , @xcite ( hereafter swh ) , @xcite ) .",
    "a new generation of experiments is measuring the cmb sky at these angular scales .",
    "in particular , two recent experiments , bima @xcite and cbi @xcite , both observing at frequencies around 30 ghz , have detected an excess of power in the multipole region @xmath1 , where the sz power is expected to be dominant over the cmb signal . nevertheless , at these observing frequencies , radio point sources are known to also produce a significant contribution to the power @xcite if they are not subtracted properly from the cmb maps .",
    "the reported detections of power have argued that this point - source contamination is not a problem , thus suggesting that the signal could be due to the sz effect @xcite .",
    "these arguments are based on analytical models or simulations of what we would expect to measure .",
    "thus , it would be interesting to explore , in a model - independent way , the nature of these contributions .",
    "the importance of this topic has been stressed recently by @xcite , who suggested to use a cross - correlation of cmb maps with maps of the large scale structure .",
    "this idea has been applied for this purpose to other datasets with larger angular resolutions ( e.g. @xcite , to the cobe data , or @xcite , to the tenerife data ) .    here , we propose a general model - independent method to determine if the measured power excess in a _ single - frequency _ map is ( mainly ) due to point sources or sz clusters . to this end , we use the fact that for frequencies below @xmath2 ghz ( @xmath0 mm ) , the thermal sz effect produces negative features in the maps , while the point sources produce positive peaks .",
    "we illustrate this fact with figure [ typical ] , where we show two simulated one - dimensional maps , one of sz clusters observed at @xmath3 ghz , and the other one of point sources .",
    "dotted lines show the original ( without sources of any kind ) zero level of fluctuations , while dashed lines show the observed ( average ) zero level once the mean of the map has been subtracted . with the same level of fluctuations ( same rms at the observed scale ) ,",
    "a power spectrum analysis is not able to distinguish these two cases , so we need to use an statistic carrying information about the sign of the subjacent signal ( e.g. the skewness ) to suggest the nature of the objects producing this excess of power . the existence of negative skewness at @xmath0 mm , while positive skewness at @xmath4 mm , is a clear prediction for sz clusters .",
    "full - width half - maximum , and no noise .",
    "dashed lines show the average ( zero ) level of fluctuations , while dotted lines show the original zero level before subtracting the mean to the map . with the same level of fluctuations ,",
    "the @xmath5 analysis does not permit to distinguish between these two cases .",
    "therefore , we need to use the skewness , or to proceed with an analysis of the asymmetry of the @xmath6 curve in order to separate these two cases.,title=\"fig : \" ]   full - width half - maximum , and no noise .",

    "therefore , we need to use the skewness , or to proceed with an analysis of the asymmetry of the @xmath6 curve in order to separate these two cases.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we investigate here the discrimination between positive and negative sources using the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the observed flux . from a given map , _",
    "the pdf function can be obtained easily as an histogram of the ( normalised ) number of pixels within a given flux interval_. this tool has been widely used in radio astronomy when studying the statistical properties of a background of point sources @xcite , because in that case the shape of this function is strongly related with the statistical properties of the sources ( i.e. theirs spatial distribution ) . in this context , this function is known as the deflection probability distribution , or the @xmath6 curve .",
    "this @xmath6 formalism has been successfully applied to study the diffuse x - ray background @xcite , as well as to determine the contribution of discrete point sources to cmb maps @xcite . for the cmb ,",
    "if we assume the standard inflationary scenario , then the primordial fluctuations are gaussian , so the @xmath6 itself is a gaussian , as well as for the standard instrumental noise .",
    "however , the main characteristic of this @xmath6 curve for point sources ( @xcite ) or for sz clusters ( @xcite ) is its non - gaussianity .",
    "typical curves for a @xmath6 distribution of point sources or sz clusters will exhibit long tails ( see figure [ figura_bonita ] ) .",
    "the point is that at @xmath0 mm , sources will produce a positive tail , while sz clusters will give a negative one .",
    "it is important to mention that at @xmath4 mm , both agns and sz - clusters will produce positive tails .",
    "then it is necessary to use other characteristics of both populations ( frequency spectra , etc ) to distinguish them . as an illustration , figure [ compara_pd_sz ] demonstrates p(d ) for sz sources at four frequencies , @xmath7 = 107 and 150 ghz ( where clusters are giving negative signal ) and 270 and 520 ghz ( where the signal from clusters is positive , and exactly opposite in sign to the previous cases ) .    )",

    "it is possible to consider clusters of galaxies as `` extended sources '' with a peculiar spectrum given by @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the optical depth for thompson scattering , @xmath17 is the dimensionless frequency , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , so that @xmath20 does not depend on redshift @xmath21 , and @xmath22 \\label{s2:g(x)}\\ ] ] is the spectral shape factor .",
    "note that this shape factor includes the term from @xmath23 , the planck function , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the formulae for the cmb spectrum distortions due to comptonization from @xcite . from here",
    ", two different but equivalent approaches can be used to estimate the spectral luminosity of the cluster .",
    "we can obtain the spectral luminosity by just integrating the change of the cmb intensity due to scattering by individual electrons of temperature @xmath26 over the cluster volume @xcite @xmath27 this expression , for the case of isothermal intergalactic gas , is proportional to the total amount of electrons in the cluster , because in that case @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the mass of the hot intergalactic gas , and @xmath30 is the mean molecular weight per electron .",
    "the important point here is that clusters increase rapidly their spectral luminosities with redshift ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "taking into account the luminosity distance to the source @xmath32 , we can obtain the spectral flux as @xmath33 .    on the other hand",
    ", according to @xcite , we can use the central value of the comptonization parameter for the cluster @xmath34 for a given @xmath35 , the surface brightness of the cluster does not depend on redshift .",
    "then , the flux from the cluster is equal to @xmath36 where @xmath37 corresponds to the angular dimension of the cluster core radius , and the @xmath38 function takes into account the angular dependence of @xmath39 over the cluster image .",
    "one important conclusion from this point of view of the problem is that clusters with given physical parameters should have a minimum flux at some redshift , due to the well - known redshift dependence of the angular dimension of the cluster with a given core radius . in the universe with @xmath40",
    "we have minimum angular dimension at @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , this happens at @xmath43 . ] and at higher @xmath21 , both angular distance and the flux will increase : clusters with given physical parameters have minimum flux where its angular dimension is minimum .",
    "it is important to note that    1 .   for an experiment with an angular resolution @xmath44 larger than the core radius of clusters ( @xmath45 )",
    ", they will be unresolved objects , and therefore they will appear as point sources for us ; 2 .   according to the dependence of @xmath46 from x , these point sources will have `` positive '' flux at @xmath4 mm , and `` negative '' flux at @xmath0 mm .",
    "3 .   for given physical parameters , clusters show a minimum flux at that redshift @xmath21 where the angular dimension is minimal .",
    "on the other hand , the observed source counts depend on the luminosity function .",
    "for instance , if we use the press - schechter formalism ( @xcite , hereafter ps ) , then we have a divergence of the ( comoving ) number density of objects at low masses ( i.e. low fluxes ) .",
    "nevertheless , we know that cooling and feedback play an important role in the sz predictions , so we do not expect to find bright sz clusters with masses below few times @xmath47 . then , it is necessary to introduce a low mass cutoff in ps formalism in order to derive realistic sz predictions , as it has been done by several authors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we expect to observe a minimum flux and a minimum angular dimension for sz clusters .",
    "several authors have studied the contribution of the sz effect to the power spectrum of cmb fluctuations at small scales , both theoretically ( e.g. @xcite ) or using simulations ( e.g. swh , @xcite ) . in any case , the main observational emphasis is put on the power spectrum ( @xmath5 ) , because it is easier to measure than , for example , the bispectrum . when determining if the excess of power at low scales detected by cbi and bima is due to sz clusters , the comparison has been done in terms of the power spectrum @xcite . however , when we are working with the power spectrum , we are losing information about the sign of the fluctuations , so we need to find the skewness , or to proceed with an analysis of the asymmetry of the @xmath6 function .",
    "the formalism relating the ( differential ) source counts and the pdf ( or @xmath6 function ) of the observed deflection @xmath48 at a given point , due to a population of poissonian - distributed unresolved sources , was first discussed by @xcite , and extended by @xcite .",
    "this analytical approach will permit us to understand much more deeply the observed shapes of the @xmath6 curves , and to relate them with the underlying source counts .    using the standard notation from radio astronomy , let @xmath9 be the differential counts per solid angle , at a given frequency @xmath7 , and let @xmath49 the response of a radio telescope to a point source ( normalised to 1 at the peak ) .",
    "let @xmath50 be the response of the instrument to a source of flux density @xmath51 located at a given distance @xmath52 of the beam centre .",
    "then , the mean number of source responses of flux between @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the beam , @xmath55 , is given by @xmath56   \\frac{d\\omega}{b(\\theta , \\phi)}\\ ] ] the relationship between @xmath9 ( or @xmath55 ) and the @xmath6 function , for the case of a pencil beam antenna , is given in terms of the characteristic functions of @xmath55 and @xmath6 , which can be written as @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the equations are @xmath59 @xmath60\\ ] ] and the @xmath6 function can be obtained as the inverse fourier transform @xmath61 this relation can be also employed in the case of tracking interferometers ( @xcite ) , using the cleaned map . for the case of a phase switch interferometer ,",
    "the above relations still holds , but replacing fourier transforms by bessel transforms @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that these expressions are general , and therefore valid for the case of negative sources .",
    "indeed , from the previous equations it follows that _ if a population of positive sources @xmath9 , with @xmath62 , is described by the function @xmath6 , then the population of sources @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , is described by @xmath65_. thus , in this section , we will restrict ourselves to study distributions of positive sources ( @xmath66 for @xmath64 ) , given that we can obtain the corresponding distribution for negative sources with the transformation @xmath67 .",
    "all the equations described through this section are implicitly assuming non - resolved objects . @xcite",
    "have studied the modifications introduced by extended sources , showing that the condition for unresolved objects applies until @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the typical size of the source , and @xmath44 the beam size .",
    "let us consider here several particularly simple but useful cases for the @xmath9 function , which can be treated analytically .",
    "these cases will be used later . for a more general case of source counts",
    ", we can use a monte carlo method to work out the p(d ) distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "first of all , we will consider a power - law shape , @xmath70 , with @xmath62 . as a second case",
    ", we will also consider a truncated power - law at a certain flux density @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath72 for @xmath73 , and @xmath70 , for @xmath74 .",
    "hereafter , we will assume that @xmath51 is given in @xmath75 , so we are implicitly writing @xmath76 , and the units for @xmath77 are jy@xmath11 sr@xmath11 .",
    "we will also assume a gaussian antenna pattern , described as @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the width of the beam , and @xmath80 its full - width half maximum ( fwhm ) .    in these cases ,",
    "the @xmath55-function can be analytically obtained .",
    "following @xcite , we define the effective solid angle ( @xmath81 ) as @xmath82^{\\beta-1 } d\\omega =   \\frac{\\pi \\theta_b^2}{4 ( \\beta-1 ) \\log 2}\\ ] ] we then obtain @xmath83 for a pure power - law , and @xmath84 for a power - law truncated below @xmath71 and the gaussian beam . from these equations , it is straight - forward to obtain numerically the @xmath6 function .",
    "these problems have been studied by @xcite and @xcite for the power law case , which is valid for @xmath85 , so in these cases the numerical calculation is even easier . ] , and by @xcite ( analytically ) and @xcite ( numerically ) for the truncated case .    finally , it is also interesting to consider the case of a power - law source counts with an upper cut - off in flux , @xmath86 .",
    "this is the expression to use in order to compute the @xmath6 function from a map where the brightest sources have been subtracted down to the flux @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath70 for @xmath87 , and @xmath88 elsewhere , then @xmath89      apart from the @xmath6 function , it is also interesting to characterise the properties of the source population by the moments of the @xmath55 distribution . for a pure power - law expression for the number - flux - density relation ,",
    "it is clear that the @xmath90th - moment of the r - distribution is @xmath91 where @xmath92 represents the cutoff value for point - source subtraction .",
    "for the truncated power - law case , the @xmath90th - moment of this distribution is @xmath93 the second moment of the @xmath55 function ( @xmath94 ) has been extensively used to characterise the confusion noise , i.e. the noise due to the presence of faint unresolved sources inside the beam @xcite .",
    "normally , the adopted criterion for the detection of sources is such as the intensity @xmath95 times the sigma of the map , so the minimum subtraction threshold can be written as @xmath96 , being @xmath97 the usual values .",
    "thus , inserting this condition in equation ( [ s^n_powerlaw ] ) , we obtain for the power - law case : @xmath98^{1/(\\beta -1 ) } \\label{ec : sigmacq}\\ ] ] where we explicitly write that @xmath99 depends on @xmath95 for this choice of the subtraction threshold . note that this threshold can be decreased if we use measurements at higher angular resolution .",
    "we will discuss this in section [ sec : roleofradiosources ] .",
    "for the power - law source counts , it is easy to show that the flux at which we have one source every @xmath100 beam areas , @xmath101 , can be written as @xmath102 from these last two equations , we immediately see that for the flux level @xmath103 , we have one source every @xmath104 beam areas .",
    "for the particular case of @xmath105 and @xmath106 , this expression takes the value @xmath107 , so we recover the well - known result that if we have more than one source of a given flux every 3040 beam areas ( it depends on @xmath108 ) , we will be limited by confusion noise .",
    "we should remind here that the @xmath6 function provides information ( roughly ) down to the flux @xmath109 at which we have one source per beam area @xcite .      to conclude this section",
    ", we will derive the scaling of @xmath6 with frequency for sz clusters .",
    "this scaling can be derived from the one for the source counts , which is given by @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "this equation is similar to the one obtained by @xcite for the scaling of the differential source counts of point sources with power - law spectra ( @xmath112 ) . , where @xmath113 does not depends on @xmath7 .",
    "] from here , we obtain @xmath114 we see that clusters of galaxies should be described by a single @xmath6 function , which is the same at all frequencies ( but rescaled ) if @xmath44 is the same , and which is equivalent to the pdf for the @xmath39 parameter",
    ". however , our description permits the use of the main characteristic of the effect , the existence of negative sources .",
    "therefore , if we compare data from two frequencies , one above @xmath115 ghz and the other one below , then in the first case the @xmath6 for clusters will exhibit a positive tail while in the second case , a negative tail , being in both cases described by the same ( rescaled ) @xmath6 function .",
    "if we now use this expression to derive the moments of the @xmath6 function , we obtain @xmath116^n < d^n ; \\nu_0 > ,   \\qquad n = 1,2,3, ... \\ ] ] therefore , we explictily see that the normalised moments of a map of thermal sz clusters ( with no noise ) , @xmath117 , are exactly the same in magnitude for all frequencies , but we have a change of sign in all the ( normalised ) odd - moments when we cross the frequency @xmath115 ghz .",
    "as we have seen in the last section , the shape of the @xmath6 function for ( positive / negative ) sources provides a means of determining the underlying source counts .",
    "therefore , we will discuss here which are the typical source counts both for radio sources and sz clusters .",
    "several authors ( e.g. @xcite ) have studied the contribution to the confusion limits from different populations of extragalactic sources . in the context of cmb measurements at frequencies close to @xmath118 ghz",
    ", radio sources are known to produce the main contribution to the confusion noise .",
    "because of this reason , recent experiments have used a source subtraction technique , and thus have produced source counts for these radio sources .",
    "these curves are well fitted by power - laws in the flux density region around a few mjy .",
    "typical values for the @xmath77 and @xmath108 parameters , at frequencies around 30 ghz , are @xmath119 sr@xmath11 jy@xmath11 , for @xmath120 mjy ( from the vsa experiment , @xcite ) , and @xmath121 sr@xmath11 jy@xmath11 , for @xmath122 mjy ( from the cbi group , @xcite ) . apart from these source counts , we can also extrapolate the @xmath123jy source counts at 8.4 ghz from vla observations @xcite up to 30 ghz . using the spectral index @xmath124 ( @xmath125 )",
    ", we obtain @xmath126 sr@xmath11 jy@xmath11 .",
    "all these source counts are summarised in figure [ review_scounts ] .     and @xmath127 ( see section [ sec_scounts ] for details ) , as well as the source counts from the paper of swh ( squares ) using hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "both source counts for clusters compare well in shape around 1 mjy , although the hydrodynamic simulations show a @xmath12820% less objects at these fluxes , and do not show an strong cutoff at low fluxes . for comparison",
    ", we also present here the differential source counts for radio sources at 30 ghz from several experiment : vsa ( taylor et al .",
    "2002 ) , at 34 ghz ; cbi ( mason et al .",
    "2002 ) at 31 ghz ; and vla ( fomalont et al . 2002 ) at 8.4 ghz .",
    "the source counts for this last experiment have been extrapolated up to 30 ghz using their mean spectral index @xmath129 . from the simple observation of these source counts",
    ", we expect that experiments with high angular resolution are going to be dominated by radio sources , if they do not consider a source subtraction strategy . ]",
    "we should mention that the contribution of radio sources to the power ( and thus to the skewness ) is decreasing with frequency in power @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the spectral index of radio sources .",
    "therefore , the contribution of radio sources to the observed map becomes less important at higher frequencies ( @xmath132 ) , while the contribution of clusters does not depend on frequency in the raileigh - jeans ( rj ) region of the spectrum .",
    "it is important to remind that other populations of sources ( e.g. thermal dust emission from galaxies ) contribute to the source counts at higher frequencies .",
    "however , we expect that future experiments like alma will show us those populations very precisely .",
    "given these source counts , the shapes of the corresponding distribution functions are characterised by long positive tails , as we have seen in the previous section .",
    "inclusion of the clustering effects of sources @xcite broadens the shape of the @xmath6 , but the important point here is that the long positive tail is still maintained .",
    "@xcite discussed count curves for thermal sz clusters , and showed that they differ strongly from the case of radio sources .",
    "@xcite have derived the source counts for the thermal sz effect using the press - schechter mass function and assuming unresolved single - type clusters . for the scaling of the temperature with the mass of the cluster , they use @xmath133 , so @xmath134 .",
    "these numbers are in agreement with those obtained from recent x - ray observations @xcite , and have been shown to fit simultaneously optical and x - ray cluster data @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that typical curves can be well fitted by euclidean power - laws @xmath135 down to a few @xmath136 , with typical values of @xmath137 sr@xmath11 jy@xmath11 ( extrapolated down to 30 ghz @xmath138 1 cm ) , and introducing a low - flux cutoff of @xmath139 mjy .",
    "swh , using hydrodynamical simulations , came to similar conclusions , although their results do not show an exact power - law behaviour , and the low - flux cutoff is one order of magnitude smaller . for illustration , we show in figure [ review_scounts ] these source counts , and our derived source counts for ps clusters , together with the radio source counts described in the last subsection .",
    "the qualitative behaviour is the same pointed above .",
    "these curves will be described in detail in section [ sec : general ] . here",
    ", we will point out two general aspects of any modelling of sz clusters .",
    "first , we should stress that the value for @xmath71 in each model ( semi - analytic or numeric ) depends on the chosen mass cutoff , @xmath140 , i.e. the minimum mass of an object contributing to the sz effect ( see discussion at the end of section [ sec:2 ] ) .",
    "this minimum mass ( @xmath140 ) is related to the minimum flux ( @xmath141 ) observed in a given cosmology . using equation ( [ di_sz ] ) , and assuming that the gas in the cluster is isothermal",
    ", we obtain the expression for the total sz decrement @xmath142 for a galaxy cluster , as a function of its mass @xmath143 where @xmath144 stands for the angular diameter distance , and @xmath145 is the gas mass fraction . using the scaling",
    "@xmath146 pointed above , we can derive for the rayleigh - jeans region of the spectrum that @xmath147 @xmath148 from here , it is straight - forward to infer the minimum flux for a given @xmath140 . as an example , if we use the standard values @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath42 , and we assume a constant value @xmath151 , then we find that for a given mass we have the minimum flux at @xmath152 , and its value is @xmath153 at @xmath154 .",
    "typical values for @xmath141 can be seen in table [ table0 ] .",
    "@xcite were considering @xmath155 independent on redshift , so @xmath141 in their case was reached simultaneously with the minimum of angular diameter .",
    "here we use a dependence of @xmath155 with redshift ( @xmath156 ) , and hence the minimum is reached when the function @xmath157 takes its minimum .",
    ".dependence of the observed flux cutoff for clusters with the minimum mass of a cluster , for @xmath8 30 ghz ( see details in text ) . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we consider an sz simulated map following ps prescription , covering 3 square degrees with a pixel size of @xmath158 and a beam size of @xmath159 , with @xmath160 , and we add different noise levels .",
    "the obtained p(d ) are shown in figure [ pd_plus_noise ] , while we present here the observed power ( @xmath161 ) in the map , the infered signal due to sz ( estimated as @xmath162 = \\sqrt{rms^2 - \\sigma_{noise}^2}$ ] ) , and the measured skewness in the map ( without applying any filtering technique ) , with its variance ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "we illustrate these facts by computing the @xmath6 functions and the skewness for the complete set of 15 sz maps based on ps modelling , observed with a gaussian beam of @xmath159 , and adding different noise levels per pixel ( @xmath164 ) , quoted in terms of the power due to clusters ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "when then consider the following cases for @xmath166 : 0.3 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 and 20 .",
    "we will also assume that the noise is gaussian and uncorrelated , as a first approximation .",
    "the resulting p(d ) curves are shown in figure [ pd_plus_noise ] , while the measured rms in the map , the recovered excess of power , and the observed skewness , are quoted in table [ table1 ] .",
    "we can see that the tail of the p(d ) function has practically disappeared at @xmath167 , although is still possible to measure skewness in the map at a high significance .",
    "when we go to @xmath168 , the skewness is no longer visible , although it is possible to detect an excess of power . at @xmath169",
    ", anything can be detected .    .",
    "we add to this map several realizations of white gaussian noise , with the amplitude quoted in the figure , and then we compute the p(d ) function . the measured excess of power and skewness in each particular case are quoted in table [ table1 ] . ]    if we now include sources in our maps , the determination of how deep we need to integrate in order to get information about the skewness can be done in the following simple way .",
    "we define here the signal - to - noise ratio per pixel , @xmath170 , as the quotient @xmath171 .",
    "we quote this quantity because it is easy to infer from the map .",
    "in addition , it is also straight - forward to convert these values into integration time @xmath172 for a given experiment , because we usually have @xmath173 . in the previous expression",
    ", @xmath174 corresponds to the power introduced by clusters and sources all together .",
    "then , if we want a @xmath95-sigma detection of skewness , it is straight - forward to derive from equation ( [ sum_skew ] ) that we need a signal - to - noise ratio better than @xmath175^{-1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath176 is the combined skewness of sources and clusters ( [ sum_skew ] ) , and @xmath177 is the number of pixels in the map , i.e. @xmath178 , with @xmath179 the fraction of sky covered , and @xmath180 the pixel solid angle . for the typical values of skewness found in our simulations , the required signal - to - noise ratio for the detection of skewness due to both point sources and sz clusters is around 25 - 40% times larger than the required ratio for the detection of an excess of power . in other words ,",
    "we need ( the well - known result of ) 1.5 - 2 times more integration time to detect skewness than to detect an excess of power .",
    "we will mention here that these values have been obtained directly from the maps , without applying any filtering .",
    "these numbers can be improved if we apply to our maps an appropriate filter to enhance the contribution of sources over the noise level , previously to the skewness or p(d ) computation .",
    "we will discuss this issue in the next section , where we also consider the effect of primary anisotropies on the maps .",
    "the computations in the last two sections were done assuming that the primordial cmb gives a negligible contribution compared with that of the sz signal and the noise . however , this is only true at arcminute scales , where the primordial anisotropy is damped to very small amplitudes , well - below the level of the expected sz anisotropy ( see the top panel of figure [ bispectrum_press ] ) .",
    "therefore , only those experiments which are observing at the high multipole region of the angular power spectrum are going to directly observe the cluster contribution .",
    "this is the case of interferometers with long baselines ( e.g. amiba , see @xcite , or bima @xcite , which has a primary beam of @xmath181 ) , or experiments with small fields of view . as it is well - known , if we are observing small patches on sky , we are sensible to multipoles greater than @xmath182 , being @xmath183 the size of our map ( see e.g. @xcite for a detailed study ) . therefore , for small fields of view we are implicitly filtering out the lowest multipoles , and we can directly apply the formalism described in the last section .",
    "however , if our experiment is sensitive to low multipoles ( @xmath184 ) , then it is necessary to add a new step in our pipeline , which consists in filtering these low multipoles , if we want to remove the contribution of primordial anisotropies",
    ". this will be the case for experiments which will cover thousands of square degrees in sky ( e.g. 8 m south pole telescope ) , or experiments covering the whole sky ( e.g planck satellite ) .",
    "this step is common to all techniques which are aimed to extract sources / clusters from a map using a single frequency observation .",
    "many filters can be found in literature , going from matched filters ( e.g. @xcite ) , pseudo - filters ( e.g. @xcite ) or wavelets ( e.g. @xcite ) . any of these methods can be used to pre - process the maps , reducing the relative contribution of primary anisotropies , and also that of the noise .",
    "the important point is that under linear filters , gaussian data will still be gaussian , and a distribution of sources still will show an skewed shape .      for illustrating this issue ,",
    "we have performed a new simulation of sz clusters , covering a larger area ( @xmath185 pixels of 0.5side each , so the map covers @xmath186 square degrees ) , using the same parameters as for the previous simulations , but with @xmath187 .",
    "the reason of considering such a large area is because future experiments will cover hundreds ( or thousands ) of square degrees on sky .",
    "we add to this map a cmb realisation following the power - spectra plotted in the top panel of figure [ bispectrum_press ] .",
    "the rms of the simulated sz map and the cmb realisation are @xmath188 and @xmath189 , respectively .",
    "finally , we also add white gaussian noise with an amplitude @xmath190 ( per pixel of 0.5 ) , and we smooth the resulting map with a gaussian beam of @xmath191 . using this map ,",
    "we have examined two different filters :    * a hanning ( or high - pass ) filter , which removes the contribution of all multipoles below a certain value @xmath192 , but linearly increasing from 0 to 1 in the range @xmath193 $ ] to avoid the ringing associated to a sharp cut .",

    ", we have divided each map by its rms prior to the @xmath6 computation .",

    "nevertheless , this residual can be modelled as an extra gaussian noise : a @xmath6 analysis does not distinguish two signals if both of them are gaussian .",
    "when using the optimal filter , the @xmath6 function shows its tail more clearly .",
