    "one can hope to pinpoint the ground - state geometry among several competing metastable configurations , this seems hardly feasible for larger particles , consisting of several tens or hundreds of atoms",
    ". however , in such systems some general ideas about the particles morphology , radial distribution of density and magnetization would be already of interest for establishing relation with measurements on particle beams , where clusters of such sizes typically participate and exhibit non - trivial variation of properties with size @xcite .",

    "one should note that a self - consistent treatment of electronic structure over a fe particle including several shells of atoms is a technically demanding task even for a fixed atomic arrangement , and the need for accurate total energy and forces for a structure optimization complicates this problem even further .",

    "therefore , after specifying the details of calculation we report the benchmark calculations for bcc / fcc phase diagram of bulk iron .",
    "further on , we allow for non - collinear alignment of magnetic density in the treatment of the fe@xmath0 cluster as another benchmark , that is discussed afterwards in relation with previous planewave calculations on this system . in the subsequent sections , we present the results for nanoparticles ( in bcc and fcc prototype structure , and with the icosahedral symmetry ) not covered by previous studies , with the 62 fe atoms as the largest .",
    "the underlying methodology and performance of the siesta method has been reviewed in recent publications .",
    "the basis set consists of numerically defined strictly localized pseudoatomic orbitals .",
    "it uses norm - conserving ( possibly hard ) pseudopotentials and a uniform real - space grid to represent the valence charge density and to calculate the hartree and exchange - correlation potentials and their corresponding matrix elements .",
    "the necessary plane - wave cutoff in this charge density representation may become large , depending on the system under consideration .",
    "in many systems , e.g. those containing magnetic @xmath13 elements , it turns out essential to use a pseudocore correction for the pseudopotential as proposed by louie _",

    "the extension of the most diffuse basis function on fe atom was about 6.8 a.u . , and the resulting size of the simulation cell for a cluster ( i.e. that would prevent direct overlap of atomic functions across the cell boundary ) was 35 a.u . for the largest particle we used ( fe@xmath6 ) .",

    "other aspects of calculation were largely similar to those of ref .  .",
    "we note that the same calculation method but slightly different setup has been recently used by diguez _",
    "the most important difference is the use of triple-@xmath14 basis set with double-@xmath14 polarized functions there , which is probably superior to our choice of a more compact basis .",
    "moreover , the spatial extension of the basis functions in the calculation by diguez _",
    "were larger @xcite .",
    "the latter fact lead to a considerably larger size of the simulation cell and , with the cutoff chosen in ref .",
    ", to a relatively sparse mesh for the representation of the charge density . however , we used a higher cutoff and hence more dense real - space mesh .    a part of the results of the present study deals with a general - shape ( non - collinear ) treatment of magnetization .",
    "whereas its implementation in the local density approximation ( lda ) may be considered as relatively straightforward , with the use of a generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) the exchange - correlation energy in non - collinear case would depend on the gradients of both the magnitude and the direction of the magnetization .",
    "to our knowledge , no such full implementation has been elaborated , and the non - collinear gga calculation of hobbs _ et al . _",
    "@xcite was not sufficiently detailed on this point .",
    "thus , we restrict the non - collinear calculations to lda .",

    "a comparison with results obtained by other methods can also be found in this publication .",
    "however , two important issues of the ground state of fe as a benchmark system of the dft were not addressed in ref .   and are discussed below .",
    "these are , a low - spin to high - spin transition with the increase of volume in fcc - fe @xcite , and the necessity to go beyond the lda in order to obtain a correct sequence of bcc  fcc ground state energies @xcite . the calculated energy ",
    "volume curves for different structural and magnetic phases of fe can be found in ref .  .",
    "in order to check the quality of pseudopotential and basis set used in the present simulation , we compared the results obtained for bulk iron using the siesta code with those produced by the full - potential augmented plane - wave method , as implemented in the wien2k package @xcite .",
    "the energy  volume curves and magnetic moment values as calculated in the lda for bcc and fcc ferromagnetic phases are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lda ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that the curvatures of both bcc and fcc energy - volume functions , not only near their corresponding minima but over whole range of relevant volumes , are faithfully reproduced by siesta . in particular",
    ", we emphasize the low spin ",
    "high spin transition in the fcc phase ( probably , reported for the first time by moruzzi _",
    "@xcite ) with a related kink in the energy  volume curve .",
    "moreover , siesta accurately describes a crossover between the bcc and fcc volume curves and the ( erroneous ) result that the absolute energy minima occurs in the fcc phase , as is well known to be an artifact of the lda . as regards the magnetic moments ,",
    "it is encouraging that their absolute values ( per atom ) , as calculated by siesta and wien2k , agree well in the bcc phase over all relevant range of volumes . in the fcc phase , the position , the magnitude and even a complicated profile of the low spin ",
    "high spin transition is correctly reproduced .",
    "a similar calculation , that also included the antiferromagnetic ( afm ; b2-type ) phase for bcc iron , has been performed with the use of gga ( perdew - bourke - ernzrhof @xcite in both siesta and wien2k realizations ) ; the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gga ] . the energy differences between phases at their corresponding equilibrium volumina are fairly well reproduced by siesta ; the relative depths of two local energy minima on the fcc energy curve come out however somehow distorted .    in order to study the effect of inclusion of upper core states ( fe@xmath17 ) in the pseudopotential generation on the equation of state , we calculated the total energy as function of volume with these states attributed either to the core or to the valence band .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gga ] , the differences are noticeable for the spin - flip transition energy but almost negligible for the comparison of bcc and fcc phases . since no equilibrium volume nor the compressibility are affected , we wo nt expect a big role of the fe@xmath17 states included beyond the fixed core on the structure relaxation or lattice dynamics with a fixed magnetic ordering .",

    "the energy gain due to forming a canted structure lies in between the estimations done with the lda in refs .   and , closer to the latter .",
    "the values of local magnetic moments of all five atoms are very close , with the basal moments slightly higher in all cases of non - collinear structures considered .",
    "the absolute values of local magnetic moments depend on definition : in ref .  , the magnetization density was projected onto a sphere with radius 1.2  , whereas in our calculation , the mulliken population analysis has been done for ( strictly localized ) basis functions .",

    "_ @xcite . the same total magnetic moment was obtained in the lda ; the equilibrium interatomic distances were however noticeably reduced as compared to the gga ( table [ tab : fe5 ] ) . the diagram of broadened energy levels ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fe5 ] ) shows that an accidental near degeneracy of two states with opposite spin direction occurs at the fermi level , but is removed both in the gga and by allowing non - collinear spin arrangement in the lda .",
    "the differences in the energy level structure from the lda and gga calculations seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fe5 ] are in part due to differences in relaxed geometry and in part due to the exchange - correlation potential as such .",
    "gga tends to produce larger separation between centers of gravity of majority - spin and minority - spin states than lda does .",
    "the effect of geometry is primarily manifested in rearranging the levels in the vicinity of the fermi level , aimed at reducing the band energy .",
    "it is difficult to estimate _ a priori _ which part of existing differences from earlier calculations has to do with certain limitations of siesta , like the compactness of its localized basis set , and what can be due to other technical differences , like the construction and treatment of pseudopotentials . from one side ,",
    "planewave methods allow a systematic enhancement of the basis set completeness ; on the other side , the use of pseudopotential presumes certain compromise between its softness and transferability , not trivial in relation to transition metals , or anyway ambiguities in its construction ( even in case of ultrasoft pseudopotentials@xcite ) .",
    "we recall that the use of siesta , contrary to planewave methods , does not necessarily presume the pseudopotential to be soft  although that is normally advantageous .    in order to bring in some systematics in the analysis of our lda and gga results",

    "( 110 mev / at . in the gga ) . actually , even the next - stable structure with the fixed spin moment of 14 @xmath7 is not so much higher in energy than the ground state ( 74 mev / at . ) .",
    "therefore the fact that it materialized as the lda ground state in two previous planewave calculations @xcite seems plausible , in view of technical differences in implementing the lda . on the contrary",
    ", the gga solution with the total moment of 18 @xmath7 corresponds to a deep energy minimum , unambiguously found in both our calculation and that by hobbs _",
    "the variation of local magnetic moments and interatomic distances over different fixed - moment states is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fsm ] .",
    "first we note that with the total magnetic moment forced to be 14 @xmath7 in the lda calculation , our relaxed interatomic distances are indeed very close to those of ref .  .",
    "moreover it is instructive to discuss the evolution of the structure and of local magnetic moments depending on the total fixed moment .",
    "it is understandable that larger interatomic distances are needed , on the average , to support larger total moments .",
    "however , basal - basal and basal - apical distances grow with the magnitude of the fixed spin moment at different rate .",
    "first the apical atoms move away from a roughly fixed triangular base ( whereby their local magnetic moments get a sharp increase ) ; near 18 @xmath7 the distance between apical and basal atoms gets stabilized , and the basal triangle grows further , as the main effect ( in both lda and gga cases ) .",
    "a more detailed insight into the composition of hybridized electronic states in cluster reveals the following . as the ( fixed ) total spin moment @xmath23 augments , the majority - spin occupation numbers steadily grow , maintaining on all atoms roughly the same magnitude .",
    "their minority - spin counterparts behave differently  some of them drop down by 0.150.2 @xmath24 , when corresponding hybridized states float upwards of the fermi level .",
    "thus , from @xmath23=14 to 16 @xmath7 the @xmath25 occupation at the apical atoms drops simultaneously with the @xmath26 of basal atoms .",
    "this is accompanied by the increase of the apical - basal bond length .",
    "further on , between @xmath23=18 and 20 @xmath7 the minority - spin @xmath27 occupation of the basal atoms drops down , that loosens the bonding within the basal triangle ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fsm ] ) . for @xmath28 @xmath7 and @xmath29 @xmath7 ,",
    "local magnetic moments of apical atoms grow faster than those of basal atoms .",

    "they attribute the difference from our present results ( and those by hobbs @xcite ) to the use of pseudopotentials , emphasizing at the same time good agreement of their data with earlier all - electron calculation by castro _",
    "however , in view of the closeness of computational schemes applied in these two all - electron calculations ( gaussian - type orbitals as basis functions ) , one may wish to perform yet another study by a different all - electron method , in order to finally clarify the issue .",
    "our calculation setup can probably be further optimized for fe systems by tuning the pseudopotential and extending the basis .",
    "so far , we managed to demonstrate that quite sensitive energetic and structural characteristics of fe clusters can be reproduced by a siesta method at a quite moderate computational cost .",
    "our next objective is the simulation of larger fe particles for which , to our knowledge , structural relaxation has not yet been done .",

    "according to duan and zhang@xcite , the total moment is 46 @xmath7 .",
    "we find a local magnetic moment 2.78 @xmath7 on the central atom , and 3.43 @xmath7  on its neighbors ( separated by 2.43  from the central one ) .",
    "the bond length as relaxed in ref .   with the lda is slightly smaller  2.38  ( as could be generally expected in the lda , that is known to overestimate the binding ) .",
    "differently to ref .   that reported an energy gap of 0.2 ev , the gap of only 0.05 ev was found in our case ( in the minority - spin subband , fully within a much larger gap of 0.6 ev in the majority - spin states ) .",
    "the lda calculation resulted in a smaller total moment of 36 @xmath7 in a somehow compressed ( 2.30  between central and peripheric atoms ) cluster .",
    "the local magnetic moment of the central atom collapses to 0.93 @xmath7 .",
    "this makes a big difference to the previously cited lda result of ref .   in what regards both the magnetization and the bond length .",
    "such disagreement is an indication that several metastable states of comparable energy exist for the @xmath30fe@xmath31 cluster , whereby the choice of one or another happens due to minute differences in the calculation setup , probably different starting conditions etc .",
    "a more systematic study could be done as a sequence of fixed - moment calculations , as discussed above for the fe@xmath0 cluster .",
    "it is noteworthy that the recent study by the same siesta method with only minutely different calculation setup @xcite indicated the icosahedral cluster with not just reduced but actually inverted magnetization of the central atom ( and total moment 34 @xmath7 ) as the ground - state structure among several competing isomers ( all treated in the lda only ) .",
    "such scattering of calculation results could be a good indication that collinear ordering of local magnetic moments becomes unstable .",
    "we tried to allow for non - collinear spin structure at least for the fe@xmath31 cluster , but failed so far to arrive at a reliably converged magnetic configuration within a reasonable calculation time .",
    "the tendency for the reduction ( or inversion ) of the central magnetic moment in the icosahedral environment becomes more pronounced in a larger fe@xmath5 cluster .",
    "the magnetic moment of the central atom gets inverted ( @xmath330.19 @xmath7 ) even in the gga calculation , that otherwise favours ferromagnetic structure as we have seen above .",
    "note that duan and zheng@xcite also obtained an inverted spin moment on the central atom in their ( unrelaxed ) @xmath30-fe@xmath5 cluster , as calculated with the lda .",
    "the magnetic moments in the inner icosahedral shell are in our case suppressed to @xmath340.34 @xmath7 , and the moments in the outer shell reach merely 1.97 @xmath7 ( for thirty 8-coordinated mid - edge atoms ) to 2.25 @xmath7 ( twelve 6-coordinated vertex atoms ) .",
    "the qualitative trend of how magnetic moments change over icosahedral shells agrees with the results of ref .  .",
    "the difference in absolute numbers can be related to a substantial compression we find in the relaxed cluster .",
    "the radius of the inner shell shrinks to 2.4  , i.e. by about 5% if compared to the equilibrium interatomic spacing in crystal . in the case of fcc structure ,",
    "such decrease in volume would change the ferromagnetic high - spine state into one of competing antiferromagnetic arrangements as , e.g. , ref .",
    "shows , or probably in a more complicated non - collinear structure , with moderate local moments .",
    "the relaxed radii of next spheres are about 4.2  ( 30 atoms ) and 4.9  ( 12 atoms ) .",
    "duan and zheng@xcite did not take inner compression in their @xmath30-cluster into account , that explains larger values of magnetic moments they obtained .",
    "one can conclude therefore that @xmath30-clusters do actually demand for additional studies , where all existing ambiguities ( ferromagnetic vs. ferrimagnetic ordering , gga vs. lda ) will be analyzed on a more systematic basis , like e.g. running a sequence of fixed - spin - moment calculations . in principle",
    "one could expect the presence of several structural solutions for some total moment numbers .",
    "the study of morphology and magnetic ordering of small clusters is a delicate matter , sensitive to the calculation details and prone to computational instabilities .",
    "corresponding results are accessible from experiment rather indirectly . in larger metal nanoparticles ( from @xmath3410@xmath35 atoms on ) ,",
    "ordered structures are often detected by electron microscopy studies , so that substantial deviations from crystalline behavior remain constrained to a ( more or less thick ) surface layer .",
    "the aim of our further study was to simulate structure relaxation and radial distribution of magnetic moments inside fe particles with several tens of atoms .",
    "calculations for bcc - related fe@xmath11 and fe@xmath1 clusters , albeit without structure relaxation , have been reported by fujima and yamaguchi @xcite ( in a row of ni and cr clusters of comparable size ) .",
    "therefore we address in the following primarily the fcc - related clusters , including fe@xmath1 for comparison .",
    "we considered particles having either a central atom , or centered around an octahedral interstitial , and allowed unconstrained structure relaxation after introducing small off - center displacements .",

    ". however , with full relaxation taken into account in the fe@xmath1 cluster , we found the magnetic moment to grow steadily towards the surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : centered ] , table [ tab : clusters ] ) .",
    "this effect seems to be intrinsic to the bcc morphology since we again find it in a larger fe@xmath2 cluster : the inward relaxation of the atoms in the first coordination shell gradually increases their local magnetic moments . in this process , the radii of 8-at .",
    "coordination spheres , whose relation in the bulk is nearly 0.87 , become pronouncedly separated in clusters , reducing the above ratio to 0.77 in fe@xmath1 and 0.79 in fe@xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : centered ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "consistently with the results of ref .  , the magnetic moments grow in the outer shells and exceed 3 @xmath7 on the surface .",
    "the remaining quantitative differences between our results for the fe@xmath1 cluster and those by fujima and yamagichi  @xcite can be due to different exchange - correlation potential ( @xmath36 used in ref .  ) .",
    "the relaxation ( neglected in ref .  ) is outwards for the second shell ( 6 atoms ) and inwards in all others .",
    "we found ( this applies to the fcc clusters as well ) the inward relaxation to be the largest on the surface , where the magnetic moment is at most enhanced .",
    "this behaviour is in consistence with well - known trends at the surface of bulk fe .",
    "the enhancement of _ local _ magnetic moments ( i.e. , inside muffin - tin spheres ) in the slab full - potential calculation was found by freeman and fu @xcite to be from 2.15 @xmath7 ( bulk ) to 2.65 @xmath7 at the ( 110 ) surface and 2.98 @xmath7 at the ( 100 ) surface .",
    "the surface relaxation ( see , e.g. , a recent first - principle calculation by spencer _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite , that also reviews experimental results for different fe surfaces ) is always inwards for the upper layer .    in the fcc - related clusters ,",
    "the internal structure is more densely packed , and a pronounced outward relaxation occurs for the second shell ( 6 at . ) of the atom - centered fe@xmath4 cluster . comparing this to the result for the ( interstitial - centered ) fe@xmath6 cluster",
    ", one sees moreover a general tendency of developing a ( quite small ) outward relaxation in the subsurface shell , whereas the outer shell is always strongly contracted . towards further inner shells ,",
    "the relaxation is rapidly stabilized , and the atomic spacing approaches that in the bulk . as in the case of the bcc cluster ,",
    "magnetic moments are largely enhanced on the surface ( and immediately below it ) , but rapidly decrease and get stabilized in the deeper shells , without showing any fluctuations .",
    "such behaviour agrees qualitatively with the results of duan and zheng@xcite on the fcc fe@xmath5 cluster , done however with fixed interatomic distances ( equal to those in the bcc bulk ) .",
    "we do not find any clear reversal of magnetization on the central atom of the fcc fe@xmath5 cluster , in contrary to what was reported in ref .  .",
    "one can not exclude the possibility for such a configuration to emerge in one of metastable states , in a calculation departing from a specially prepared initial magnetic configuration .",
    "however , whereas afm and fm types of ordering are known to be competitive in fcc fe , on the high - spin side ( large volumes ) the fm arrangement is definitely more favourable , at least in the bulk@xcite .",
    "moreover , experimental estimates of mean magnetic moments for the fe@xmath5 cluster ( 3.1 @xmath7 , according to ref .  ) are in better agreement with our result of 2.77 @xmath7 than with 2.58 @xmath7 after duan and zheng@xcite .",
    "an additional study of the plausibility of afm ordering was undertaken for the fe@xmath6 cluster .",
    "the layer - by - layer ( i.e. , cuau - type ) afm organization lifts some degeneracies in the radial distribution of atoms ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : uncentered ] ) , but otherwise is consistent with the above observations ( inward surface relaxation ; enhancement of magnetic moments towards the surface ) .",
    "the total energy per atom is by 0.19 ev higher in the afm configuration than in the corresponding fm case , that effectively rules out this particular ( admittedly arbitrary ) magnetic configuration as a competitive one .",
    "however , the fact that the magnitudes of magnetic moments over shells are almost identical in afm and fm cases implies that the individual spins are localized enough to survive in different magnetic orientations , and could probably prove a gain in the magnetic energy in some of them",
    ".    it could be instructive to analyze how the enhanced magnetization at the surface decomposes into contributions from different basis orbitals , and how the electron density gets distributed between the inner part and the surface of clusters in the course of relaxation .",
    "fortunately one can establish very clear trends , common for fcc and bcc clusters of different size .",
    "magnetic polarization of the @xmath37 states is in all cases well below 0.1 @xmath7 and antiparallel to the magnetic moment in the @xmath13 shell .",
    "it gradually disappears ( to about 0.01 @xmath7 ) towards the surface .",
    "this is consistent with the magnetic moment decomposition for the fe@xmath5 cluster by duan and zheng@xcite . in disagreement with the latter , we find that the polarization in the @xmath38 shells , being parallel to that of @xmath13 , steadily increases from the core region outwards and contributes as much as 7% of local magnetic moments at the surface .",
    "the major , @xmath13-related , part of the local moment grows due to simultaneous increase of majority - spin and decrease of minority - spin occupations .",
    "however , the majority - spin @xmath13 subband never gets saturated ( in fact , its occupation does not exceed 4.8 electrons ) .",
    "the charge transfer always happen from the core region to the surface ; the nominal valence charge per fe atom is 7.47.6 in the cluster core and slightly beyond 8 at the surface . as definition - dependent as these qualitative estimates might be , they do not let to oversee a general qualitative trend .",
    "duan and zheng@xcite found fluctuations of charge from one atom shell to another , but on the average no clear distinction between core and surface atoms  hence the difference we talk about must come from relaxation , taken into account in our case .",
    "it is understandable that the overall compression in the cluster due to its `` surface tension '' shifts upwards the electron states in the inner region , that results in the outward charge flow .",
    "surface atoms experience stronger relaxation but they have lower coordination .",
    "the atoms adjust in the cluster so as to smooth the radial charge distribution ; simultaneously the magnetization profile tends to acquire certain regularity .",
    "the enhancement of the @xmath38 contribution to the magnetic polarization on the surface is related with the abovementioned redistribution of charge , because extra electrons in the surface layer can be more easily accommodated by majority - spin states of the @xmath39 symmetry .    according to the experimental evidence @xcite ,",
    "average magnetic moments per atom start from nearly 3 @xmath7 in small clusters and gradually decrease to the bulk value of 2.2 @xmath7 in 400500 atom particles .",
    "this implies ferromagnetic ordering and bcc - related structure in large clusters .",
    "the fluctuations of magnetization prior to this asymptotic value being achieved are not yet systematically explained .",
    "_ emphasize @xcite that the mean magnetic moment in the fe@xmath5 atom is anomalously large ( nearly 3.1 @xmath7 ) , and bring the icosahedral structure into discussion .",
    "however , we have seen that the @xmath30-fe@xmath5 cluster has in fact a moderate mean magnetic moment of 2.2 @xmath7 ( or slightly larger , but anyway well below that of the fcc cluster , in ref .  ) . in order to describe experimental variations of mean magnetic moments in simple terms , billas _",
    "proposed @xcite a model of fe magnetic moments decreasing from the surface into the interior of the cluster , and getting inverted in the fourth shell from the surface .",
    "while essentially confirming this model in what concerns the asymptotic end values of magnetic moments ( on the surface and in the bcc interior ) , our simulation does not yet produce any strong evidence for the fluctuations in between , when starting from ferromagnetic test configuration .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis ( e.g. , within a fixed spin moment scheme ) could help to single out other competing magnetic structures .    addressing the issue of structural order vs. disorder ,",
    "it is worth noting that soler _",
    "@xcite studied the morphology of small ( 38 to 75 atoms ) `` ordered '' and `` amorphous '' gold nanoparticles , using the same calculation scheme as here in order to refine trial geometries , provided by energy minimization in an empirical potential . in all cases",
    "`` amorphous '' particles were found to be more stable , and the subsequent analysis shows the reason for this to be due to high elastic contribution to the total energy of a particle , relaxed in the course of an amorphous - like rearrangement of atoms . in our case ,",
    "inner shells of fe particles are also contracted , as compared to the bulk crystal .",
    "it would be interesting to probe the effects of amorphization , and their interplay with magnetic characteristics , in an _ ab initio _ simulation once realistic models for ground - state fe arrangements become available .",
    "summarizing , our results favors a conclusion that the relaxation and magnetic properties of small fe nanoparticles have certain common features , relatively independent on morphology , magnetic ordering and size .",
    "namely , the structure relaxation is practically confined within 23 outer shells , the surface layer relaxes strongly inward , and the magnetic moments on the surface are enhanced to beyond 3 @xmath7 .",
