    "photon pair generation can be accomplished through spontaneous parametric processes including spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) , based on a second - order non - linearity , and spontaneous four wave mixing ( sfwm ) , based on a third - order non linearity .",
    "both of these processes are extremely versatile in terms of the resulting properties which emitted photon pairs can have .",
    "thus , sfwm has been used , or proposed , as the basis for the generation of factorable photon pairs  @xcite , of photon pairs with arbitrary spectral correlation properties  @xcite , of polarization - entangled photon pairs  @xcite , and of ultrabroadband photon pairs  @xcite .",
    "in addition , if implemented in a fiber , sfwm has a number of important advantages including the possibility of very long interaction lengths and straightforward integration with existing fiber optic networks .",
    "recently , in the context of classical optics have been important experimental demonstrations of four - wave mixing ( fwm ) @xcite , and the implementation of nonlinear optical devices , such as wavelength converters and multi - wavelength fiber lasers which are based on fwm @xcite .",
    "while the use of a guided wave configuration constrains the transverse spatial properties of emitted photon pairs , the spectral properties can vary widely . in common with spdc , in the process of sfwm",
    "the energy splitting ratio in a given photon pair is governed only by phasematching , so that while the emission bandwidth can vary greatly in accordance with the properties of the nonlinear material and the pump , this bandwidth can not typically be made naturally very small . in this paper",
    "we explore the use of @xmath0 cavities for the generation of sfwm photon pairs which are sufficiently narrowband for the effective implementation of atom - photon interfaces , i.e. so that one photon from a sfwm photon pair may be reliably absorbed by a singe atom .",
    "this is an important line of research which represents a route for the implementation of quantum memories  @xcite .",
    "this paper extends to the process of sfwm a previous analysis from our group , see  @xcite , of cavity - enhanced spdc  @xcite . in our earlier paper",
    "we analyzed the spectral and temporal properties of spdc photon pairs produced in a nonlinear cavity .",
    "we showed that the use of a high - finesse cavity results in photon pair emission constrained to the narrow spectral windows defined by the cavity modes .",
    "in addition we studied how the spectral mode structure imposed by the cavity translates into a specific mode structure in the temporal domain , and we showed that for a sufficiently narrowband pump , the presence of a cavity leads to a flux enhancement relative to an equivalent source without a cavity . in the present paper , we have carried out a corresponding analysis for sfwm . because resonance at the emission frequencies only ( i.e. excluding the pump ) yields both narrowband emission modes and a cavity - induced flux enhancement , in this paper we concentrate on this case which is technologically simpler to implement .",
    "in addition , in this paper we separately analyze the cases of resonance to one , or both of the emission modes .",
    "we discuss the presence of high - dimensional temporal entanglement in sfwm photon pairs emitted in a @xmath0 cavity , and we present an analytic expression , in closed form , for the joint temporal intensity valid under certain approximations .",
    "we present expressions for the absolute brightness along with corresponding numerical simulations , as well as a simple geometrical model which leads to an improved understanding of the cavity - induced flux enhancement .",
    "a @xmath0 sfwm cavity source can be implemented with an optical fiber on which two bragg gratings are recorded to form a cavity [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : esquema](a ) ] .",
    "likewise , the cavity can be in the form of a fiber ring @xcite , which could be implemented through a length of fiber connected to one input port and one output port of a fiber - based beam splitter and two lengths of fiber , to form the input and output of the device , connected to the remaining two ports [ see fig .

    "alternatively , recent work has shown the feasibility of observing optical non - linear effects in waveguide micro - rings , where light is coupled and out - coupled from the cavity through a straight waveguide placed tangentially to the ring  @xcite .",
    "this latter route represents a highly promising approach , which could be used for generating sfwm photon pairs and which could be incorporated into integrated optics circuits .",
    "this paper aims to present the required theory for the description of various aspects of sfwm cavity sources .",
    "in this paper we are interested in studying the spectral and temporal properties of photon pairs generated by spontaneous four wave mixing ( sfwm ) in a fiber - based ( or waveguide - based ) optical cavity .",

    "[ ratio2 ] and [ ratio3 ] ) depend on @xmath142 and yield the flux enhancement described below .",
    "this leads to an expression for the flux enhancement , @xmath185 , defined as the quotient @xmath186 , with @xmath187 .",
    "we thus obtain    @xmath188    making it clear that the flux enhancement increases with the coefficient of finesse .     space .",
    "each circle , with diameter @xmath80 , represents a spectral cavity mode .",
    "the square grid shown has a spacing given by the mode separation @xmath175 , while the diagonal band , with width @xmath142 indicates the pump spectral amplitude .",
    "( b ) this panel shows a similar schematic , for a cs cavity .",
    "the cavity modes are now elongated , with a width @xmath80 for the signal mode .",
    "[ fig : geometria],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    let us now turn our attention to a cavity source which is resonant only for one of the sfmw modes , i.e. a cs or ci cavity . in this case",
    "the parameter @xmath173 is given by    @xmath189    as can be seen in fig .",

    "thus , the ratio between the flux emitted from the cavity and the flux emitted from sfwm without cavity is the same in the three regions and is given by    @xmath192    this result indicates that in a cs cavity there is no an enhancement in the emitted flux due to the cavity , as was the case for a csi cavity .",
    "this behavior can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ fig : varsigma ] .      in our discussion of the sfwm flux ,",
    "we have so far focused on the flux attainable in a sfwm cavity source , relative to an equivalent source without a cavity .",
    "it is likewise important to study the flux in absolute terms , which our analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec : flux ] and in particular eq .",
    "( [ flux2 ] ) permits .",
    "while much of the behavior of the relative flux discussed so far is qualitatively identical to the behavior expected for a spdc @xmath193 cavity source , the absolute flux leads to some considerably different behaviors between the @xmath193 and @xmath0 cases .",
    "this difference is related to the fact that for sfwm , two pump photons are annihilated in each generation event , rather than just one for spdc .",
    "this implies that , within the phasematching bandwidth @xmath194 ( i.e. for @xmath195 ) the sfwm flux scales linearly with the pump bandwidth @xmath142 , while the spdc flux remains constant with respect to @xmath142 for @xmath195 . in physical terms , each pump frequency of one pump photon may participate in the sfwm process together with all pump frequencies of the other pump photon , limited by phasematching , so that increasing the pump bandwidth leads to a greater range of phasematched frequency combinations , and hence to a greater flux .",
    "in contrast , in the case of spdc , each pump frequency may be considered to act independently from other frequencies leading to a constant flux vs @xmath19 dependence , for a constant average pump power .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : absflux](a ) we present the absolute sfwm flux , assuming a csi cavity , plotted as a function of the pump bandwidth @xmath142 , for a number of different values of the reflectivity @xmath196 , in particular for @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 , with other source parameters selected to be identical to those assumed for fig .",
    "[ fig : varsigma ] . in this figure",
    "we have also indicated the cavity mode width @xmath80 value for each of these reflectivities and the @xmath200 value .",
    "note that the effect of the cavity is that the flux vs @xmath142 dependence is linear for @xmath201 , climbs more slowly for @xmath202 , and thereafter reaches a plateau at a value of @xmath142 which for large @xmath203 is close to @xmath80 .",
    "thus , while the maximum cavity - induced flux enhancement occurs for @xmath187 , as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : varsigma ] , the maximum absolute flux occurs within the above mentioned plateau . for a large @xmath203",
    ", the flux can be maximized if the pump bandwidth satisfies @xmath204 .",
    "note that in the case of cs cavity , the absolute flux vs @xmath142 curves ( not shown ) yield essentially the same curve as the case without cavity shown in fig .",

    "fig : absflux],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    as a particular example , let us calculate the absolute flux for the specific source design of section  [ sec : spdesign ] .",
    "this source involves degenerate pumps at @xmath119 m , with sfwm wavelengths @xmath120 m and @xmath121 m .",
    "we assume that the cavity source is based on a photonic crystal fiber of length @xmath72 cm , with a core radius of @xmath117 m and air - filling fraction of @xmath118 .",
    "we assume a reflectivity of @xmath205 , which corresponds to a coefficient of finesse of @xmath206 , and a cavity mode width of @xmath207 mhz , which defines resulting sfwm emission bandwidth and is matched to the d2 line transition of cesium .",
    "we assume an average pump power of @xmath208 mw , with a pump bandwidth @xmath142 selected to have a value @xmath209ghz which fulfills the condition @xmath204 of the previous paragraph .",
    "this value of @xmath142 corresponds to a pulse duration of @xmath210ns , and we assume a repetition rate of @xmath211mhz . the resulting photon pair flux can then determined by numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ flux2 ] ) : @xmath212 photon pairs per second .",
    "in this paper we have studied the generation of photon pairs through the process of spontaneous four wave mixing in @xmath0 cavities .",
    "we have presented expressions for the two - photon state , showing that in the spectral domain the joint amplitude is given by the product of the corresponding joint amplitude in the absence of a cavity and a matrix of signal and idler modes defined by the cavity .",
    "the width of each cavity mode @xmath80 is proportional to @xmath213 where @xmath203 is the coefficient of finesse .",
    "thus , the emission bandwidth can be effectively controlled by the quality of the cavity , which leads to the possibility of matching the frequency and bandwidth of one of the sfwm photons to a particular atomic transition , for the implementation of photon - atom interfaces .",
    "we have also presented an analysis of the two - photon state in the temporal domain . in particular , we have shown that the spectral cavity modes translate into a corresponding matrix of modes in the temporal domain . the envelope which describes the amplitude of these modes has a non - factorable shape in the space formed by the times of emission .",
    "this results in quantum entanglement in the temporal - mode degree of freedom with a dimensionality which scales with the effective number of cavity round - trips made by the sfwm photons , as governed by the cavity finesse . also , we show that by approximating the cavity spectral modes through gaussian functions it becomes possible to express the joint temporal intensity in closed analytic form .",
    "we have presented expressions for the absolute source brightness , given in terms of a two - dimensional frequency integral .",
    "we have evaluated this integral numerically to yield on the one hand a comparison of the flux obtained in the cavity to the flux obtained in an equivalent source without a cavity . through this analysis",
    "we have shown that the use of a pump bandwidth which is smaller than the inter - mode spacing results in a flux enhancement with respect to an equivalent source without a cavity .",
    "we have presented a simple geometrical model which clarifies the physics behind the flux enhancement , and leads to an expression for the flux enhancement in terms of the coefficient of finesse .",
