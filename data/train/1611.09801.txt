    "in the most simple picture , planetary nebulae ( pne ) are formed by low- and intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath1 0.8 6 @xmath2 ) after the strong stellar winds at the end of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) . at that point , stars contract and heat up , crossing the hr - diagram at constant luminosity becoming sufficiently hot and bright to ionize the previously ejected material ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the formation and detectability of pne depends strongly on the interplay between two different timescales .",
    "the evolutionary timescale of the central star of the pn ( cspn ) , which provides the ionizing photons , and the dynamical timescale of the circumstellar material . in this manuscript",
    "we focus on the evolutionary timescales of the cspne .",
    "in particular , we will discuss the new results presented by from full stellar evolution computations of the post - agb and cspn phases .",
    "these new post - agb models are based on state - of - the - art stellar evolution computations , they include an updated treatment of the agb microphysics ( radiative opacities and nuclear reaction rates ) as well as of the macrophysics ( convective boundary mixing and mass loss rates ) .",
    "the models have been calibrated and tested to reproduce several observables during the post - agb and previous evolutionary phases ; e.g. solar radius and depth of the convective zone , width of the upper main sequence , mass range of carbon - rich agb stars , oxygen abundances of pg1159 stars , semiempirical initial - final mass relationship , c / o ratios of agb stars and cspne see for details .    ) of the sequences presented by different authors . following @xcite",
    "we have defined , and plotted , @xmath3 for all sequences as the time elapsed from @xmath4 to the point of maximum @xmath5 in the hr diagram during the post - agb evolution .",
    "_ left panel : _ @xmath3 as a function of the final remnant mass @xmath6 .",
    "_ left panel : _ @xmath7 as a function of the initial progenitor mass @xmath8 .",
    "color coding indicates the initial metallicities ( @xmath9 ) of the sequences , as described in the color bar . ]     as a function of the post - agb luminosity for sequences of similar metallicities . ]    , @xmath10 sequence from . ]",
    "as shown in fig.[fig1 ] , the post - agb / cspn crossing timescales ( @xmath7 ) computed by are 3 to 10 times shorter those of the sequences of similar remnant mass ( @xmath11 ) computed by @xcite and .",
    "the new post - agb models also evolve faster when compared at equal initial masses ( @xmath8 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) or post - agb luminosities ( @xmath12 ; see fig . [ fig2 ] ) . the faster evolution of the new models can be traced back to the adoption of updated microphysics and the inclusion of convective boundary mixing during the thermal pulses on the agb see for a detailed discussion .",
    "the latter , in particular , leads to the occurrence of third dredge up for lower stellar masses and to carbon ( c ) pollution of the envelope .",
    "in fact , post - agb timescales become even shorter in the case of the stellar models computed by and @xcite , which assume a more intense convective boundary mixing during the thermal pulses on the agb , and consequently have stronger third dredge - up episodes .",
    "c - pollution of the envelope increases the luminosity of the burning shell and decreases the critical envelope mass ( @xmath13 ) at which the models depart from the agb . then , as @xmath7 is mostly determined by the pace at which the hydrogen(h)-burning shell consumes the remaining h - rich envelope , an increase in the c - pollution of the envelope leads to a faster post - agb evolution .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the value of @xmath13 can not be arbitrarily set for a given sequence .",
    "@xmath13 is mostly set by the h - burning shell luminosity as well as by the composition of the h - rich envelope . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "h - burning post - agb models have a very tight relationship between the effective temperature ( @xmath5 ) and the envelope mass ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the departure from the agb occurs as soon as @xmath14 is reduced close to these corresponding post - agb values .",
    "in particular , this means that the wind intensity at the end of the agb plays no role in the determination of @xmath13 .",
    "this is fortunate , as the intensity of @xmath15 at the end of the agb , or the early post - agb , is currently not known . in order to convince the reader of this counter - intuitive fact ,",
    "we have recomputed the @xmath16 , @xmath17 sequence presented by artificially increasing the mass loss ( @xmath15 ) after the last thermal pulse up to 3 orders of magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , upper left panel ) . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( bottom left panel ) the value of @xmath13 is independent of @xmath15 at the end of the agb .",
    "only the post - agb timescales are affected ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , bottom right panel ) because at high values of @xmath15 the h - rich envelope is mostly reduced by winds , speeding up the evolution .",
    "it should be noted , however , that @xmath18 can affect the post - agb envelope mass in an indirect way . as @xmath13 is strongly dependent on the luminosity of the sequence , and luminosity",
    "does not stay constant during the agb phase , different @xmath15-values during the whole agb evolution can change the value of @xmath13 for a given sequence .",
    "given the significantly shorter timescales , higher luminosities and different initial - final mass relations of the models presented by , as compared with the usually adopted tracks from @xcite and , one may wonder about the impact of these results for studies that rely on stellar evolution models as inputs .",
    "for example , @xcite studied 32 pne from the bulge and obtained cspne - black - body temperatures and pne expansion ages .",
    "they find that the cspne and progenitor masses derived from the post - agb models of are in agreement with our current understanding of the stellar formation history of the galactic bulge and the white dwarf mass distribution .",
    "this was not the case when the tracks of @xcite and were used .",
    "the fact that , for @xmath19 , the post - agb timescales of the new models are shorter than those of @xcite and for the same initial masses ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , right panel ) will have an impact in the understanding and modeling of the planetary nebula luminosity function ( pnlf ) .",
    "* mendez ( 2016 ) ) concludes that with the new stellar models , cspne with masses as low as @xmath20 are able to create relatively bright pne see also zijlstra et al . in these proceedings .",
    "consequently , the progenitors of pne close to the cut - off of the pnlf will be older than previously expected , something that will help to explain the lack of sensitivity of the pnlf cut - off to the age of the harboring population . due to their shorter post - agb timescales and larger brightnesses ,",
    "the new models are also expected to have an impact on the study of the diffuse x - ray emission from the inner regions of planetary nebulae by means of radiation - hydrodynamics numerical simulations e.g . and @xcite .",
    "in addition to these results , we can also speculate that the shorter post - agb timescales of the new models will help to understand the formation pne around low mass post - agb stars e.g . as determined by asteroseismology , see , and references therein .",
    "also , shorter post - agb timescales might help to understand the lack of cspne and post - agb stars in m32 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( brown et al . 2008 ) ) .    a word of caution ,",
    "while the new models are to be preferred over the older grids , they are not devoid of uncertainties . in particular , the stellar models of fail to quantitatively reproduce the lifetimes of m- and c - type agb stars , pointing to a need of a better calibration of convective boundary mixing and agb - winds .",
