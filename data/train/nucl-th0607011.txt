    "in the last few years the possibility to perform very accurate calculations in few - nucleon systems has stimulated a new attitude in studying the nature and form of the nuclear force .",
    "differently from what was common in the past , nowadays potential models are tested not only on the increasingly accurate nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) data and triton binding energy , but also on bound and resonant states of more complex systems .",
    "the modern debate on nuclear forces focuses on potential models that can schematically be grouped into three different categories .",
    "category a includes the most traditional potentials .",
    "their two - body parts are either based on meson exchange models  @xcite , or largely phenomenological  @xcite .",
    "however , all of them include the essential one pion exchange term at long range and reproduce the nn scattering data with very high accuracy . however , when tested on @xmath3 nuclei , they show non negligible underbinding .",
    "three - body forces have been introduced to fit the a=3 binding energy , and more recently also to describe energies of bound and low - lying resonant states of p - shell nuclei  @xcite .",
    "they require very intense computational efforts when used in may - body systems .",
    "category b includes the effective field theory ( eft ) potentials @xcite , which have a stronger connection to quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "they imply consistent two- , three- or more - body terms .",
    "the number of these terms and of the associated parameters , as well as the accuracy in reproducing data , increase significantly with the order of the expansions .",
    "the common feature of potentials belonging to categories a and b is the presence of three - body operators .",
    "these require very intense computational efforts when used in many - body systems .",
    "category c includes potentials that , while describing nn scattering data with high accuracy make use of the remaining off - shell freedom in order to reproduce few - body ground state energies and low - lying resonances , avoiding the necessity of three - body operators  @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic reactions can provide good constraints of the off - shell behavior of the potential .",
    "the potentials of category a have been tested at large on quite a number of observables in the photo- and electro - disintegration of the two - body system .",
    "the comparison with data is very good , at least within the non relativistic regime ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . as to category b potentials",
    ", analogous systematic studies are still missing .",
    "investigations on electromagnetic reactions have been performed also in the three - body systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) for potentials falling into category a and b.    due to its large binding energy the four - body system represents a very good testing ground for off - shell versus many - body properties of the nuclear force .",
    "however , only recently an ab initio calculation of the total photodisintegration cross section of @xmath4he has been performed @xcite with a category a potential of local nature ( av18 and uix ) @xcite .",
    "even if the lack of precise experimental data limits the validity of such kind of calculations as test of the off - shell behavior of the potentials , it is interesting to calculate the same observable also with a potential of category c. in particular , one can ask whether potential models that reproduce the binding energy of the alpha particle in two different ways , either by including three - body operators , or by a proper choice of the off - shell behavior of the two - body potential , predict the same results for the electromagnetic observables",
    ".    among the potentials of category c , of particular interest are the potentials of refs .",
    "@xcite , which are highly non - local and given in terms of matrix elements constructed by means of the j - matrix version of inverse scattering theory . due to the lack of the three - body operator and the way they are constructed , they lead to rapid convergence , when used in many - body ab initio calculations based on complete basis expansions , as was shown in @xcite within the no core shell model approach @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is twofold . on the one hand we want to extend the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite to non - local potentials . on the other hand we would like to compare the results on the total photodisintegration of @xmath0h , @xmath1h and @xmath2he below pion threshold , obtained with two versions of the jisp , to those given by typical category a potentials .",
    "the choice of this particular electromagnetic observable is that in this case the validity of siegert s theorem allows to take largely into account , in an implicit way , the two- ( or more- ) body current contributions . because of the particular form of the jisp ( in matrix and not in operator form ) it would be otherwise very difficult , if not impossible , to construct them in a consistent way . on the other hand",
    ", just these currents can help to get an idea on the importance of the underlying degrees of freedom that are `` mocked '' by the off - shell part of the potential .",
    "the photodisintegration cross sections are calculated here using the lorentz integral transform ( lit ) method  @xcite which allows the treatment of the continuum states dynamics by means of a bound state technique .",
    "this method is briefly summarized in sec .",
    "we use the symmetrized hh expansion @xcite for the three- and four - body calculations , while standard numerical methods are used to solve the differential equations in the two - body case .",
    "the use of the hh formalism is natural in configuration space and for local potentials .",
    "since the jisp are non - local and given in terms of two - body matrix elements between harmonic oscillator ( ho ) states , the many - body hh formalism has to be adapted to this case .",
    "iii contains the description of how this is achieved . in sec .",
    "iv we present the results for the total photodisintegration of a=2,3,4 nuclei and compare them to those obtained by category a potentials .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "the total photoabsorption cross section is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the fine structure constant , @xmath7 represents the energy transferred by the photon and @xmath8 is the response function defined as @xmath9 here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the nuclear ground state wave function and energy , @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote eigenstates and eigenvalues of the nuclear hamiltonian @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the operator relevant to this reaction ( it is assumed that recoil effects are negligible ) . in the low - energy region considered here",
    "one can rely on siegert s theorem and use for @xmath15 the unretarded dipole operator @xmath16    the calculation of @xmath8 seems to require the knowledge of the continuum states @xmath17 .",
    "however , this difficulty can be avoided using the lit method .",
    "this method has been described extensively in several publications @xcite .",
    "here we only summarize the three steps which are needed for the calculation of @xmath8 .",
    "_ step 1 . _ the equation @xmath18 has to be solved for many @xmath19 and a fixed @xmath20 .",
    "this is a schrdinger - like equation with a source .",
    "it can be shown easily that the solution @xmath21 is localized .",
    "thus one only needs a bound state technique to calculate it .",
    "one generally adopts the same bound state technique as for the solution of the ground state , which is an input for eq .",
    "( [ liteq ] ) .",
    "we use expansions on the hh basis , as explained in sec .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 are chosen in relation to the physical problem .",
    "in fact , as it becomes clear in _ step 2 _ , the value of @xmath20 is a kind of `` energy resolution '' for the response function and the values of @xmath19 scan the region of interest . in our case",
    "we are interested in the resonance region and up to pion threshold .",
    "therefore we solve eq .",

    "we illustrate the effect of the inclusion of retardation and of other multipoles ( electric and magnetic ones up to multipole order @xmath131=4 ) , where the non - relativistic one - body current and the siegert operator are considered ( calculation corresponds to arenhvel s _ normal _ calculation for the deuteron photodisintegration , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one notes that the additional contributions increase the cross section only slightly . in principle one has to include also other current contributions ( meson exchange , isobar , and relativistic currents ) , however , as shown in fig .",
    "7.1.8 of ref .",
    "@xcite these effects are rather small . in the considered energy range they lead to a reduction of the _ normal _ cross section between 2% and 3% , thus bringing the total result very close to the unretarded total photoabsorption cross section . in comparison to experimental data",
    "@xcite there is good agreement of the unretarded cross section with the bonnra potential , while with the jisp6 potential the data are somewhat overestimated .",
    "now we turn to the total photoabsorption cross section of @xmath1h and @xmath4he . in fig .",
    "3a we show the triton case with the jisp6 and jisp16 potentials and for the nuclear force models av14 @xcite and uviii @xcite ; av18 @xcite and uix @xcite ; bonnra @xcite and tucson - melbourne ( tm ) @xcite .",
    "results for the av14+uviii and bonnra+tm potentials are taken from ref .",
    "the situation is similar to the deuteron case of fig .",
    "2 : small differences among the low - energy peak heights of all potential models and beyond 20 mev differences between the conventional nuclear force models and the jisp , which , however , are considerably more pronounced than for the deuteron case . since beyond the peak there are no triton total photoabsorption cross section data available , the comparison with data is done for the @xmath1he case ( see fig .",
    "3b ) , choosing one of the jisp ( jisp6 ) and one conventional ( av18+uix ) potential model . unfortunately the data @xcite have rather large error bars and do not lead to a clear picture .",
    "however , one can say that between 20 and 50 mev there is a better agreement with the jisp6 , while beyond 50 mev the conventional potential models are favored .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the @xmath4he total photoabsorption cross section for the jisp6 and jisp16 potential models , as well as for the av18+uix nuclear force . the calculation for av18+uix is described in @xcite . there it is discussed that the convergence of the hh expansion is rather slow because of the three - nucleon force .",
    "as already mentioned , for the jisp we find a much better convergence , though no effective interaction is introduced . in fig .",
    "4 one notices that the trend observed for deuteron and three - nucleon cases is confirmed . beyond the peak",
    "the cross sections obtained with the jisp are considerably higher than that obtained using the conventional nuclear force model av18+uix .",
    "this effect is more pronounced than for the three - nucleon case , which in turn is already stronger than found for the deuteron case .",
    "in addition , for @xmath4he the jisp lead to somewhat lower peak heights and to a shift of the peak position by about 2 mev towards higher energy , when compared to the av18+uix result .",
    "it is evident that the latter agrees much better with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "here we should mention that the experimental situation is not yet settled ( see also @xcite ) , particularly regarding the height of the low - energy peak ( the shown data are the only experimental total @xmath4he @xmath132 results that extend to energies beyond the peak region ) .",
    "in this work we have presented results for the total photoabsorption cross section of the two- three- and four - nucleon systems , obtained within the recently proposed j - matrix inverse scattering potential models .",
    "the calculation in the three- and four - body systems are performed via the lit method and the hh technique . to this",
    "aim the hh formalism has been adapted to accommodate non - local potentials .",
    "the comparison of the jisp results with those obtained with a few more traditional realistic potentials , including two- and three - body forces , has shown that , while the latter give very similar results , jisp display a rather different behavior , especially beyond the resonance peak .",
    "the differences increase with the nuclear mass .",
    "these results show that a `` classical '' electromagnetic observable as the total photonuclear cross section is able to emphasize the rather different off - shell properties of these two classes of potentials",
    ". in particular , in this observable non - localities of the two - body potential and three - body forces are not equivalent . considering that , different from the jisp , the traditional potentials have in common the long range one - pion exchange part",
    ", one may ascribe the discrepancies to this fact .    in the case of deuteron",
    "the comparison with data speaks in favor of the more traditional two - body potentials . for the three - body systems data are missing or have insufficient accuracy , making the comparison inconclusive . regarding the four - body system the old data of ref .",
    "@xcite seem to favor the traditional potentials , as in the deuteron case .",
    "more recent data obtained in lund @xcite , while measuring only the @xmath4he@xmath133 cross section point in this direction as well , provided that they are extrapolated to @xmath134 by means of the charge symmetry argument .",
    "more data of higher accuracy are very much needed to further clarify the issue of two- and three - body forces .",
    "we thank a.m. shirokov for sending us the potential matrix elements of the jisp models . the work of n.b .",
