    "sensor networks consist of sensors that measure and provide information in remote or spatially distributed areas @xcite . with the advancement of miniaturization and wireless technologies , the ubiquity of sensor networks is becoming more prevalent .",
    "the benefits of having smaller dies in semiconductors include ; physically smaller devices , increase ratio of computing power per energy , better battery life , etc . a few examples that utilize sensor networks include military , health care , environment monitoring , agriculture , etc .",
    "sensors are often required to be autonomous , decentralized , and in remote areas .",
    "such requirements place limitations on sensors and sensor networks , including low power , limited memory and data storage , physical size , limited communication bandwidth , cost , privacy , and security @xcite . there are proposed solutions for some of these limitations such as energy harvesting , low - power processors , smaller memory footprint , etc .",
    "however , security is a pressing issue since sensors face unique challenges . without proper security",
    "the entire sensor network can be compromised and sabotaged .",
    "limited computing power in sensors restrict them from utilizing large complex encryption algorithms , also with limited memory and data storage the secure key can not be too large .",
    "another security issue facing sensors is that the installation of optical fiber or wire connections is often not economical .",
    "thus they are often accessible only by wireless communication , which is restricted to work with conditionally secure key exchange , and make them vulnerable to packet capture , sniffing , and injection @xcite . in an attempt to mitigate some of these security issues ,",
    "there have been several proposals to secure sensor networks , which include defenses against specific attacks and more efficient protocols @xcite .",
    "sensor networks require data confidentiality , data integrity , data freshness , availability , self - organization , time synchronization , authentication , secure broadcasting and multicasting , and sensor privacy .",
    "attacks on sensor networks include denial of service ( dos ) attacks , sybil attacks , traffic analysis attacks , information flooding attacks , and node replication attacks @xcite .",
    "defensive measures against some of these attacks are key establishment , key encryption , policy - based approaches , intrusion detection , and trust management .",
    "there have been several approaches for managing trust in sensor networks , the approach to trust management is based on the sensor network s trust mechanism .",
    "trust theory has different applications and perspectives , and the concept of trust has been associated with past behaviors and/or reputation from trusted peers @xcite .",
    "the notion of trust has been specified by trust definitions , trust characteristics , and trust values @xcite .",
    "trust values have been measured by several different methodologies such as ; bayesian models @xcite , beta distribution systems @xcite , subjective logic models @xcite , entropy models @xcite , fuzzy models @xcite , and game theory models @xcite .",
    "however , these trust value models are not able to distinguish between conditional and unconditionally secure key exchanges , thus these models need to be expanded for related applications .    rather than expanding former models we propose a new key exchange trust evaluation model , which takes into account the type of key exchange ( conditional / unconditional ) between two sensors .      in software - based key distribution ( exchange ) protocols",
    "the security is only computationally - conditional , meaning that the eavesdropper has all the communicated information , and with enough computing resources or time the key can be fully extracted .",
    "the advantage of software - based key distributions is that they are relatively cheap , easy to install and run , and the key can be exchanged wirelessly .",
    "unconditionally secure key exchanges are key distribution methods that are information theoretically secure @xcite , which means that the information is not in the communicated signal , see next paragraph .",
    "thus even with infinite computing resources the eavesdropper can not extract the key . however , physical ( hardware - based ) key exchanges are the only schemes that can provide unconditionally secure key exchange .",
    "hardware - based key exchanges are more expensive than software - based schemes , moreover , wireless key exchange is not possible ( except quantum key distribution with single photons , which require complete darkness . )    so far there are two physical key distribution classes that offer unconditionally secure key exchange : quantum key distribution(qkd ) @xcite and the kirchhoff - law - johnson - noise(kljn ) scheme @xcite .    in qkd principle ,",
    "the bits are exchanged via single photon communications and the physical law which provides unconditional secure key exchange is the quantum no - cloning theorem @xcite .",
    "recently , the fundamental security proofs for qkd have been debated @xcite .",
    "qkd has also had issues with the non - ideality of practical building elements , which have lead to the cracking of existing communicators , including commercial devices @xcite .",
    "although , these practical non - ideality problems can be patched there is no security until the patch is known and applied .",
    "other concerns with qkd systems are the bulky physical size , it is relatively expensive , requires large power consumption , its sensitivity to vibrations , and the required `` dark optical fiber '' . these characteristics of qkd make it almost impossible to integrate into a sensor .    in the kljn scheme",
    ", the key bit is exchanged via a wire channel and utilizes statistical physics @xcite .",
    "the actual physical laws of providing security are the second law of thermodynamics and the properties of gaussian fluctuations .",
    "relative to qkd , kljn can be integrated on a microchip thus it does not have issues with physical size , energy required , sensitivity to vibrations , etc .",
    "kljn can be implemented into a sensor , but will require a wire to connect every sensor that intends to acquire a unconditionally secure key exchange .",
    "an illustration of the kljn setup is in figure  [ figone ] . in this figure alice and bob",
    "have two identical resistor pairs which are @xmath0 for the low resistor and @xmath1 for the high resistor .",
    "each resistor has noise voltages that are enhanced by johnson noise , @xmath2 for alice s low resistor , @xmath3 for alice s high resistor , @xmath4 for bob s low resistor , and @xmath5 for bob s high resistor . during the key bit exchange period",
    "the first step is for alice and bob to select either @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "the selection of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is random and both are equally likely to be selected . since the selection of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is random neither alice or bob know which resistor will be selected .",
    "once alice and bob select their respective resistor they measure the voltage and/or current in the wire . the channel voltage can be modeled by @xmath6 and the channel current can be modeled by @xmath7 with k being boltzmann s constant , @xmath8 measuring the effective temperature , @xmath9 being the loop resistance , and @xmath10 being the kljn bandwidth @xcite . from @xmath11 or @xmath12",
    "alice and bob know which resistor the other end selected , and they already know which resistor they selected .",
    "if the voltage noise level is high then they both selected high resistors , and if the voltage noise level is low then they both selected low resistors , in these outcomes the key bit is discarded and the next period begins . if an intermediate voltage noise level or current noise level is measured then a secure key bit is generated , stored , and the next period begins .",
    "this process continues until the desired number of key bits are generated .",
    "[ figone ]    the core system in figure  [ figone ] is secure against passive ( non - invasive ) attacks in the idealized case .",
    "however in @xcite , when eve is tampering with or changing the system via an active / invasive intervention such as launching a mitm ( man - in - the - middle ) attack @xcite , the core system is not enough to guarantee security .",
    "similarly , non - idealities which represent deviations from the original scheme , cause security leak @xcite . for defending the system against these kind of attacks , the instantaneous voltage and current amplitudes are measured by alice and bob , and these quantities are communicated and compared via a public authenticated data channel .",
    "alice and bob have a full and deterministic model of the system , because it is a classical physical system , therefore incessant measurement of the current and voltage is allowed . based on their comparison and preconditions , alice and bob",
    "decide to keep or discard the bit having compromised security @xcite .",
    "the authentication uses only log@xmath13 secure bits of the exchanged bits , where @xmath14 is the number of bits carrying the current and voltage data in the public channel . in practical applications this channel can be wireless or wired .",
    "utilizing kljn in sensor networks could significantly increase the security level in sensor networks due to its unconditionally secure key exchange .",
    "current trust measures for sensor networks do not utilize unconditionally secure key exchange .",
    "trust is a belief that may change over time , and is usually based on past behaviors and/or reputation from a community .",
    "many sensor networks measure trust based on past behaviors and/or reputation @xcite , but there has not been a trust measurement that considers the class ( conditionally / unconditionally secure ) of the key exchange utilized in their measurement of trust .",
    "we propose a new key exchange trust system that considers the class of the key exchange .",
    "the system utilizes the * * g**eometric series to evaluate the key exchange trust , thus we call it the g key exchange trust function .",
    "in this paper we consider peer - to - peer networks only .",
    "in such a network it will be impractical to have direct wired connections from every sensor to every other sensor , thus we propose to use both wired and wireless communication channels , and form a wired - wireless hybrid network .",
    "the wired sensors can be utilized in areas where other sensors are in close proximity .",
    "each sensor can then be ranked based on its key exchange and the number of key exchanges with trusted peers .",
    "we therefore propose the g key exchange trust measure system .",
    "the wired - wireless network will require sensors to have at least two communication devices , one for wireless and one or more for wired .",
    "a cable will also be required and can have either one or two wires inside .",
    "one wire will be for the key exchange , and the other optional wire can be utilized as a data communication channel .",
    "figure  [ fig : network ] is an illustration and example of the proposed wired - wireless hybrid sensor network with ten sensors . in this example sensors",
    "a through g utilize both wired and wireless communication channels , and sensors h through j utilize only its wireless communication channel .",
    "sensors a and b have a direct connection with the base station , thus they can have an unconditionally secure key exchange with the operator .",
    "note how sensor e has two wired connections , this sensor will require two kljn communicators .",
    "sensors c , f , and g have only one wired connection and will require one kljn communicator .",
    "sensors a , b , and d have three wired connections , and will require three kljn communicators .",
    "sensors h through j only use their wireless communication channel , these sensors are the most vulnerable to attacks and thus have a low key exchange trust value .",
    "table  [ table : ke ] list every sensor s key exchange with all sensors in the network of figure  [ fig : network ] , e.g. , sensor a has a kljn key exchange with sensors b and d , thus we denote this in set notation as @xmath15 . similarly , sensor a has a wireless key exchange with sensors c , e , f , g , h , i , and j , we denote this in as a@xmath16 . note that @xmath17 , that is every sensor communicating with sensor a must be classified as having either a wired kljn key exchange or a wireless key exchange , but not both . the g key exchange trust system is discussed and analyzed in the following section .",
    "[ fig : network ]    .this table list every sensor s key exchange with all sensors in the network of figure  [ fig : network ] .",
    "every sensor is classified as having either a wired kljn key exchange or a wireless key exchange .",
    "set notation is used to categorize the sets as either kljn or wireless key exchange . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : network ]    as shown in table  [ table : network ] the g key exchange trust system will give a higher key exchange trust evaluation to sensors that are part of a kljn key exchange , the more kljn key exchanges a sensor has the higher the key exchange trust evaluation .",
    "sensors without a kljn key exchange will have a lower key exchange trust evaluation , even if there are an infinite number of sensors with only wireless key exchange .",
    "this mechanism will prevent a lower level sensor attempting to undermine a higher level sensor since there are ceiling limits to sensors that only share a wireless key exchange .",
    "a kill switch is in place to allow the g system to remain subjective with any sensor at any time .",
    "since all sensors in the g system must have both wired and wireless communication channels it will not be practical in some applications . sensors in the g system will also need to utilize both symmetric encryption for the kljn key exchange , and asymmetric encryption for the wireless key exchange , this will increase energy requirements , computing requirements , memory , and data storage .",
    "sensors are dependent on the operator or base station to provide or broadcast the kljn and wireless key exchange sets of every senor in the network , this dependency will require the sensors to remain centralized . for sensors to be autonomous future work must be done where each sensor can broadcast its key exchange sets .",
    "another concern is concealing the cable between the wired sensors .",
    "unconditionally secure key exchange has not been experimented with in sensor networks , but the realization of such a network should be of significant interest .",
    "the cost of having unconditionally secure key exchange for sensor networks is high , but such is the price for high security .    for sensors that can not communicate with other sensors or the base station due to the distance between them , a multi - hop method",
    "is utilized @xcite .",
    "the g system does not consider multi - hop cases and would give the sensor a key exchange trust evaluation of the last sensor it was able to communicate with , this can be improved in future work .",
    "sensor networks can also utilize different protocols for different kljn geometric networks to reduce the cable , time , and kljn communicators cost as has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "in this study we introduced sensor networks along with its applications , limitations , and security issues .",
    "we then discuss unconditionally secure key exchanges , and mention how the kljn key exchange can be included in sensor networks .",
    "we also mention current trust methodologies for sensor networks .",
    "since current trust methodologies do not consider unconditionally secure key exchange we introduce the geometric key exchange trust system , a new key exchange trust method for sensor networks that considers unconditionally secure key exchange in the key exchange trust measure .",
    "an example of sensor networks with sensors utilizing both wired and wireless communication channels is depicted in figure  [ fig : network ] .",
    "the g key exchange trust system is then introduced and applied to the sensor network example in figure  [ fig : network ] .",
    "the g key exchange trust system is then analyzed , discussed , and modeled by eq .",
    "( [ equ : gk3 ] ) .",
    "table  [ table : network ] shows that a higher key exchange trust evaluation is given to sensors with kljn key exchanges , the more kljn key exchanges a sensor has , the higher the key exchange trust evaluation .",
    "( [ equ : gk3 ] ) and table  [ table : network ] also show that there are ceiling limits to sensors that only share a wireless key exchange .",
    "the g system depends on the operator or base station to provide the key exchange sets of every sensor in the network .",
    "the kill switch allows the g system to remain subjective of every sensor in the network .",
    "we then discuss open questions about the g system and possible future improvements .    99    culler , d.e . ; estrin , d. ; srinivastava , m. overview of sensor networks _ ieee computer society _ * 2004 * , _ 37 _ , 41 - 49 .",
