    "heavy - ion induced reactions are appropriate to explore the response of nuclei under stress of different nature and to delineate the degrees of freedom at work in the various bombarding energy domains .",
    "the regime of warm medium - mass ( @xmath9 ) compound nuclei ( cn ) formed in fusion reactions at incident energies below 10 mev / nucleon is characterized by the predominant role of the angular momentum of the emitting nuclei and of the mass ( charge ) asymmetry degree of freedom .",
    "an abundant literature has reported that the cn decay modes populate the whole mass ( charge ) range from evaporated light particles ( like _ n , p _ , @xmath10 ) up to the symmetric fission , and the intermediate - mass fragments ( imf ) in between the two extremes  @xcite . from the accumulated data one could identify two basic features of the final products : the charge distribution evolves from a u - shape at low angular momentum ( with a minimum at symmetry ) towards a bell shape at high angular momentum ( with a maximum around symmetric fission )  @xcite ; a staggering of the fragment cross - sections @xmath4 is superimposed on this global feature , with a magnitude which depends on the size of the emitting nuclei and which increases as the neutron - to - proton @xmath11 ratio of the emitter decreases  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the staggering effects reflect some properties of nuclei involved at the end of the disintegration cascade @xcite .",
    "indeed , a plausible explanation of the staggering of @xmath4 would be that structure effects persist in the production mechanism and that fragments are emitted relatively cold , otherwise the subsequent decay would have blurred the fluctuations of the yields .",
    "moreover , the neutron content of the emitter manifests itself in the magnitude of the imf cross - sections as shown in refs .",
    "this raises the question of the @xmath11 dependence of the decay channels which is a relatively unknown and very attractive topic in the context of radioactive beam facilities .    on the theoretical side",
    ", sophisticated approaches have been developed to explain the complex facets of the disintegration modes .",
    "many features of the light - particle emission are satisfactorily understood within the hauser - feshbach formalism  @xcite emphasizing the role of the available phase space at each step of the whole cascade  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the mechanism at the origin of the fragment emission from cn has stimulated numerous approaches as for example : the multi - step hauser - feshbach model including emission channels up to ca  @xcite ; the transition  -state model describing imf emission as asymmetric fission  @xcite ; the dynamical cluster - decay model assuming pre - formed cluster  @xcite ; the dinuclear system model aiming to treat the competition between the evaporation channel and the binary - decay channels associated to fusion and quasifission processes  @xcite .",
    "those approaches are based on distinct hypotheses as well as fundamental nuclear ingredients such as the level density or the fission barriers to describe the thermal and collective properties that rule the competition between cn decay modes .",
    "it is worth noticing that the @xmath11 degree of freedom is expected to play a crucial role on these quantities .",
    "for example , the level - density parameter is related to the effective mass , a property of the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction that is sensitive to the neutron - proton composition of the nuclei ; the fission barriers depend strongly on the symmetry energy that is weakly constrained by experimental data  @xcite . therefore",
    ", new experimental data on decay channels of nuclei at high angular momenta and different @xmath11 ratio are sorely needed .",
    "besides the decay stage , the phase of cn formation has its own crucial interest . indeed , since more than three decades",
    ", a rich wealth of data has revealed the complexity of the fusion process and of the collisional stage preceding the cn formation .",
    "for example , extensive experimental and theoretical investigations have shown that fusion mechanism at the vicinity of the barrier  @xcite is drastically influenced by the internal structure and @xmath11 ratio of the participating nuclei .",
    "moreover , a large body of data for a wide variety of systems has demonstrated the role of dynamical effects on the fusion process and the strong inhibition of the cn formation by quasifission ( qf ) .",
    "this phenomenon corresponds to the separation of the partners after a significant rearrangement of the mass and charge degree of freedom  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in medium - mass systems , it has been recently shown  @xcite , that the competition between fusion - fission and quasifission mechanisms strongly depends on the angular momentum .",
    "this calls for new data to extent our knowledge on the influence of the dynamics on fusion process in this mass region .",
    "finally , we would like to stress that an accurate prediction of the imf cross - sections has important consequences .",
    "indeed , one could perform spectroscopic studies of the residual nuclei left in excited states after the fragment emission .",
    "this kind of experiment has shown the strong selectivity of the @xmath12c emission with respect to the 3@xmath10 channel  @xcite .",
    "an evident area for such studies is around the doubly magic @xmath13sn since these nuclei are extremely difficult to reach by means of the standard fusion - evaporation method .",
    "however , a recent attempt  @xcite has suggested that the @xmath12c emission from a @xmath14ba cn formed in the @xmath15ni + @xmath15ni fusion reaction at @xmath7 7 mev / nucleon does not offer a valuable alternative for producing a given isotope compared to the fusion - evaporation method .",
    "therefore a better understanding of the imf emission from medium - mass cn at low excitation energy is required .    for these reasons we investigated the decay modes of excited nuclei produced in @xmath0kr + @xmath1ca reactions at 5.5 mev / nucleon incident energy .",
    "this energy regime is well adapted to form nuclei in a controlled way in terms of excitation energy since the incomplete - fusion process or pre - equilibrium emission are expected to be negligible .",
    "exclusive measurements on an event - by - event basis are required to provide a characterization of the mechanism .",
    "therefore a 4@xmath16 detection apparatus with low energy thresholds and charge identification of the products is needed .",
    "the combination of both indra array  @xcite and the technique of the reverse kinematics permit us to collect high quality data on evaporation - residues and elemental cross - sections of fragments .",
    "our data set , obtained with a projectile pair differing by four neutrons , gives new insights on the influence of the neutron content on decay mechanisms that allows us to evaluate the respective merits of very popular theoretical approaches .",
    "some preliminary results have been recently presented  @xcite .",
    "here we concentrate on main features of the heavy products , and the study of the light - particle emission will be presented in a forthcoming paper .    in table",

    "full ( open ) squares are data from the @xmath5kr + @xmath1ca ( @xmath6kr + @xmath1ca ) reaction , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    we observe a spectacular improvement with respect to the predictions of the busco and gemini codes . indeed , the dns model satisfactorily reproduces the main features of the @xmath8-distributions . for both reactions ,",
    "the shape of the @xmath8-distributions , the strong odd - even - staggering for 5  @xmath132  10 , the small cross - sections of light fragments as well as @xmath4 around @xmath56 are well reproduced .",
    "however , for 16 @xmath3 22 the dns model underestimates the fragment cross - sections by about a factor 2 to 3 .",
    "since the whole capture cross - section is considered , no improvement could be obtained within the present version of the model .",
    "nevertheless , as reported in table  [ tab : tab0 ] , @xmath26 values of the dns model are coherent with @xmath23 calculated using the proximity potential . moreover , the er cross - sections predicted by the dns model @xmath214 ( see table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) are compatible with data , although the dependence of the er cross - section on the neutron - to - proton ratio does not follow the same trend as the one seen in the experiment .",
    "thus , the depletion observed in the calculated yields for 16  @xmath215  22 might signal , in addition to the capture process , the presence of a class of deep - inelastic collisions associated to an incomplete relaxation of the entrance channel mass ( charge)-asymmetry , and presumably localized in a @xmath116-window just above @xmath26 . in this case the yields of the products near the entrance channel ( @xmath216 ) can exceed the predictions of the dns model .",
    "the staggering of the yields decreases as the atomic number increases in agreement with the experimental findings .",
    "since the pairing energy of the dns light nucleus decreases with increasing mass number @xmath187 , the odd - even effect becomes weaker for larger @xmath8-values .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the staggering is also influenced by the excitation energy stored in the primary fragments ( see dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig.esepexp ] ) . for nuclei with @xmath217 the calculated",
    "average excitation energy is below the particle emission threshold and these nuclei do not decay further except by @xmath218-emission which is not taken into account in the present version of the model . for heavy fragments ,",
    "the average excitation energy and spin are high enough to open - up the decay by light particles which strongly attenuates the odd - even structures of the @xmath8-distributions .",
    "such results agree with our conclusions from the analysis of the fragment - particle coincidences .    in agreement with data ,",
    "@xmath4 for fragments with @xmath219 are larger for the @xmath5kr + @xmath1ca reaction .",
    "this can be explained by their smaller mass - asymmetric decay barriers for the reaction induced with @xmath5kr projectile .",
    "the calculated yields for 3  @xmath132  10 show a large odd - even - staggering of about a factor 10 .",
    "such o - e - s is much bigger than the experimental results and is mainly due to a strong underestimation of the odd-@xmath8 yields of b , n and f while the c and o yields are well reproduced .",
    "the low predicted yields of the light fragments with odd-@xmath8 could be related to the prescription for the static deformation for odd - nuclei which enters into the nucleus - nucleus potential .",
    "reasonable changes of static deformation would have minor effects on the yields .",
    "another possibility would be the interplay between some microscopic properties ( such as pairing interaction for example ) and deformation experienced by the dinuclear system en route to separation .",
    "data would indicate an attenuation of these properties with deformation .",
    "finally , the nuclear level densities below separation energy could play a role in the competition between channels since they could still retain some structure behaviours which are not included in the fermi - gas approach  @xcite .",

    "[ fig.csdns]a , b ) , one can deduce that the contribution from high - partial waves to the yields for @xmath42 is negligible .",
    "the calculated partial production cross - sections @xmath222 for some fragments from c to ar are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.cspartial ] for the @xmath5kr  +  @xmath1ca reaction at 5.5 mev .",
    "we observed that most of the light fragments , as for example c , o or ne , comes from angular momenta around @xmath2234060 @xmath177 . on the contrary ,",
    "most of the heavy fragments as for example cr , fe or ni is associated to partial waves around @xmath137 .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath222 develops two components for fragments with large @xmath8 showing a population through both cn and quasifission mechanisms .",
    "examination of the results leads to the conclusion that qf is the dominant decay channel for heavy fragments while light fragments are predominantly populated by cn .",
    "thus , the angular momentum strongly influences the competition between the binary decay channels and , correspondingly , the probability of light - fragment emission .",
    "one should also remind that the careful identification of the origin of the binary decay products is a prerequisite before extracting information such as viscosity or fission barriers from fitting data .",
    "thus , it would be very instructive to probe the competition between cn and qf components in the same mass region by studying small mass - asymmetric reactions where the flux going to cn is expected to dominate over a large range of incident partial waves .",
    "experiments using a spin - spectrometer with high capabilities  @xcite could be appropriate for such investigations .",
    "the dns model provides a good framework to describe both qualitatively and quantitatively fusion- evaporation cross - sections as well as the main features of the yields of the light fragments such as c or o. the calculations confirm what we have deduced from the analysis of the fragment - light particle coincidences .",
    "the excitation energies and spins left in the heavy partners ( sn , cd ) after c or o emission are very high and since these heavy nuclei are neutron - deficient , the secondary emission of light particles leads to the formation of residues of masses a @xmath7 100 with extremely small cross - sections .",
    "we infer that better conditions could be obtained with reactions induced by a very neutron deficient kr beam at bombarding energy close to the coulomb barrier  @xcite .",
    "we have presented the results of a study on decay modes of excited nuclei formed in @xmath0kr + @xmath1ca reactions at 5.5 mev / nucleon .",
    "the @xmath2 indra array which is very well suited to study the fate of violent collisions  @xcite , has been exploited here for the first time in low bombarding energy regime .",
    "the kinetic - energy spectra , the angular distributions and the @xmath8-distribution for fragments with 3 @xmath3 28 show the characteristics of fission - like phenomenon .",
    "analysis of the fragment - particle coincidences indicates that light partners in very asymmetric fission are produced either cold or at excitation energies below the particle emission thresholds .",
    "we observe a persistence of structure effects from elemental cross - sections with a strong odd - even - staggering for the lightest fragments .",
    "the magnitude of the staggering does not significantly depend on the neutron - to - proton ratio of the emitting system .",
    "the er cross - section of the @xmath5kr  +  @xmath1ca reaction is slightly higher than the one measured in the @xmath6kr  +  @xmath1ca reaction . the fission - like component is larger by @xmath7 25% for the reaction having the lowest neutron - to - proton ratio .",
    "last , the cross sections of the light clusters ( li , be , b ) are astonishingly low .    these experimental features were compared to the predictions of various theoretical approaches assuming either the formation of cn ( busco , gemini ) or describing both the collisional stage preceding the cn formation and the competition with quasifission process ( dns model ) .",

    ", the dns model describes quantitatively the er cross - sections , the odd - even - staggering of the light fragments and their low cross sections as well as a large portion of @xmath4 for 12 @xmath3 28 .",
    "finally , the features of the charge distribution for 3 @xmath3 28 are consistent with a strong competition between fusion - fission and quasifission processes .",
    "examination of the results suggest that the quasifission mechanism is the dominant production mode for heavy fragments while light clusters are predominantly populated by decay of cn .",
    "the confrontation with data confirms the crucial role of the mass ( charge)-asymmetry degree of freedom on the disintegration of excited nuclei .",
    "moreover the potential energy surface that governs the evolution of the system must contain the contribution of microscopic properties of nuclei such as pairing interaction , shell effects or static deformations .",
    "the interplay between the mass ( charge)-asymmetry and @xmath11-degrees of freedom and their mutual influence on the competition between fusion evaporation reactions and binary decays is yet to be explored .",
