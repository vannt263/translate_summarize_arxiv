    "the interplay of disorder and quantum criticality is a long - standing and still open problem in condensed matter theory .",
    "one aspect of this problem which has received considerable recent attention is the quantum griffiths behavior which has been shown to occur near quantum critical points in certain model systems @xcite .",
    "the model systems in which quantum griffiths behavior has been unambiguously demonstrated all possess a crucial common feature , namely that in the absence of disorder the critical degrees of freedom exhibit dissipationless , hamiltonian spin dynamics ( indeed typically characterized by dynamical exponent @xmath0 ) .",
    "however , many systems of experimental importance involve magnetic degrees of freedom coupled to conduction electrons @xcite , and therefore _ overdamped _ dynamics implying a pure - system critical behavior characterized by @xmath1 . extension of the theory of quantum griffiths behavior to this case is therefore an important issue . in a series of papers",
    "@xcite castro - neto and jones have argued from various points of view that such overdamped systems exhibit quantum griffiths behavior similar to that exhibited by undamped systems , and they and others have further argued that this phenomenon is at the heart of the non - fermi - liquid behavior observed in many heavy fermion materials @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine the issue of quantum griffiths behavior in nearly critical systems exhibiting overdamped dynamics , finding that it is essentially nonexistent , being replaced instead by superparamagnetic behavior .",
    "the essence of our analysis is this : in undamped models quantum griffiths effects arise from an interplay between the low probability of nucleating magnetic droplets in the paramagnetic state and a low but non - negligible quantum tunnelling of these droplets . in a metallic , dissipative environment",
    "there is a strong suppression of tunnelling by dissipation , so that the droplets which dominate the susceptibility behave more or less classically , leading to superparamagnetic behavior rather than quantum griffiths behavior .    our results amount to an implementation of ideas outlined in @xcite and to a generalization , to a non - vanishing density of defects , of a previously reported analysis @xcite of the magnetic droplet produced by a single , spatially localized defect , and rely heavily on the results of this previous work .",
    "the method used to analyse the dynamics of a distribution of defects is similar to that used in @xcite and the broad qualitative features of the results we obtain are very similar to those obtained in that work .",
    "however , the specifics and the physical implications seem different .",
    "the issue is discussed in more detail in the conclusion .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section ii we present the model and the method used in our analysis . in section iii",
    "we show that the approach reproduces results previously obtained in the dissipationless case .",
    "section iv presents our new results concerning griffiths - like behavior in systems with overdamped dynamics .",
    "section v is a summary , comparison to other work , and conclusion , and is written so that readers uninterested in the details of the derivations may obtain from it the essence of our results .",
    "the canonical quantum griffiths problem concerns the effect of weak disorder added to a pure ( non - disordered ) system which possesses an ising symmetry and is tuned to be near a quantum critical point .",
    "we consider a system in imaginary time and @xmath2 spatial dimensions ( differences occurring for two spatial dimensions warrant a separate treatment , which will be presented elsewhere ) .",

    "it is convenient to define a parameter @xmath11 which measures distance from criticality .",
    "we consider only parameters such that the pure system is in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "we take the disorder to couple to the square of the order parameter via @xmath12 and assume it to be gaussian distributed with correlator ( @xmath13 represents average over configurations of the disorder ) @xmath14 where the kernel @xmath15 decays on the scale @xmath16 and satisfies @xmath17 . because we are interested only in length scales @xmath18 we will take @xmath19 to be a @xmath20 function . the dimensionless quantity",

    "( i.e. dominated by the @xmath30 term ) if @xmath31 , and non - dissipative at higher frequencies .",

    "the mean - field approximation for @xmath36 involves a translation - invariant model and fluctuations for which momentum is a good quantum number .",

    "the crucial feature of the mean field solution is the presence of _ droplets _ : regions in which the order parameter is locally non - vanishing .",
    "quantum griffiths effects then arise from dynamical fluctuations of these droplets ; to study them one must estimate the droplet density and tunnelling rate .",

    "second , and much more important , the overdamped dynamics leads to a long - ranged ( in time ) instanton - instanton interaction , which reduces the tunnelling rate further and indeed drives it to zero if the damping exceeds a critical value , as noted by previous authors @xcite .    to calculate the effects of damping we insert the ansatz , eq .",

    "this paper presents an investigation of the possibility of quantum griffiths effects in three dimensional metallic system which , when pure ( non - disordered ) is near an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point with ising symmetry . for comparison we present also a parallel investigation of quantum griffiths effects in a model of an insulating system near a similar critical point .",
    "the key feature of metallic systems is the dissipative dynamics arising from the particle - hole continuum of electrons ; in the model insulating system the dynamics are undamped .",
    "comparison of the two calculations shows that dissipation suppresses quantum griffiths effects completely , leaving instead an effectively superparamagnetic behavior .",
    "a simple precis of our results follows .",
    "quantum griffiths effects are a consequence of randomness : essentially , in a random system which is on average in the paramagnetic phase , regions ( droplets ) may occur in which the randomness pushes the system locally to the ordered side of the phase diagram , so that local formation of an order parameter is favored . in certain circumstances",
    "( first noted by mccoy @xcite ) these droplets may dominate the response .",
    "in this situation one may approximately write the susceptibility , @xmath199 , as an average over droplets times a susceptibiltiy for each droplet , i.e. @xmath255 we have used simple extremal statistics arguments ( similar to those used by thill and huse @xcite ) to estimate the droplet probability distribution @xmath256 and an extension of earlier work which studied a particular class of droplets @xcite to obtain the susceptibility @xmath257 of a given droplet .",
    "we were then able to perform the average over droplets and obtain an estimate for the susceptibility .",
    "this method reproduces the essential features of the standard results for quantum griffiths effects in undamped ( insulating ) systems , namely that the low @xmath186 behavior of the susceptibility is governed by a new exponent @xmath258 given by the product of the inverse correlation length @xmath211 and inverse mean square disorder amplitude @xmath105 and a non - universal number ( which we estimate for the particular model we consider ) .",
    "a divergent susceptibility results when @xmath258 becomes less than unity , and the results are functions only of @xmath106 .",
    "we note one additional interesting finding .",
    "the standard arguments which produce the standard quantum griffiths results are based on a picture of dilute droplets and apply only if the @xmath9 is not too large ( otherwise the droplets percolate , and an isolated droplets picture fails ) . for the model we consider we obtain an estimate for the critical value of @xmath9 , and find that depending on the value of the non - universal factor in @xmath258 , droplets may reach the percolation point before the griffiths exponent drops below unity . in other words , in the models we consider the existence of a quantum griffiths regime ( which one may somewhat imprecisely define as a divergent susceptibilty arising from fluctuations of isolated droplets ) is not guaranteed ",
    "it may or may not occur depending on the value of a non - universal coefficient . sufficiently near a critical point",
    "a regime of divergent susceptibility does of course occur , but the proper theory of this regime would have to go beyond the model of isolated droplets and treat correctly the mixing of critical and griffiths singularities .",
    "we also found that for undamped systems near antiferromagnetic critical points the _ amplitude _ of the divergent term in the susceptibility vanishes rapidly as criticality is approached , indeed as @xmath116 , essentially because each relevant droplet has a magnetic moment of the order of unity and as criticality is approached the droplets get larger in size but fewer in number .",
    "the main new result of our work , however , pertains to metallic systems with overdamped ( dissipative ) dynamics . for these systems ( i.e. for quantum critical phenomena in metals )",
    "the answer is entirely different .",
    "the physics in the undamped case is a balance between the probability of a droplet occurring ( which vanishes rapidly as the droplet size or amplitude increases ) and @xmath257 , which is of the order of the inverse of the quantum tunnelling rate of the droplet and diverges rapidly as the droplet size or amplitude increases .",
    "the effect of dissipation is to strongly decrease the tunnelling rate , and indeed to drive it to zero for droplets larger than a particular , amplitude - dependent , size . for relevant parameters",
    "we find that a non - vanishing density of droplets does not tunnel at @xmath179 ; these give rise to a superparamagnetic ( @xmath259 ) susceptibility rather than a quantum griffiths ( continuously varying exponent ) behavior .",
    "for those droplets which do behave quantum mechanically , the effect of dissipation on the tunneling rate is found to change the balance between probability and @xmath257 dramatically .",
    "we find that even considering only the droplets which can tunnel quantum mechanically , those which dominate the integral for @xmath199 are those which are right on the edge of classical ( non - tunnelling ) behavior , leading again to superparamagnetism rather than to quantum griffiths behavior .",
    "we also find that the dependence on parameters is different : in the undamped case , apart from prefactors the mean square disorder strength @xmath260 and the correlation length enter via the combination @xmath106 . in the damped case additional factors of @xmath9 occur which drive the system more rapidly to classical behavior .",
    "our results raise questions about the claims @xcite that quantum griffiths effects are important in heavy fermion materials , which are precisely three dimensional metals with ising symmetry , typically near antiferromagnetic quantum critical points . ref .",
    "@xcite contains a phenomenological description of data . if the theoretical results presented here are accepted , then these data require a different , non - griffiths interpretation .",
    "@xcite argued that a disordered system near a quantum critical point could be mapped onto the _ disspationless _ ising model in a transverse field ; the results of the present paper and of @xcite indicate on the contrary that dissipation is essential .    ref .",
    "@xcite uses a novel variant of a technique introduced by dotsenko @xcite to study essentially the same model as is studied here .",
    "a rather different result was obtained , namely that quantum griffiths effects can be important in a reasonable range of the phase diagram even in the metallic case .",
    "we outline the differences between the results found here and those of ref .",
    "the method introduced by dotsenko @xcite and used by ref @xcite begins from a _ classical _ theory defined by a functional integral with action given by the static term in eq .",
    "[ s ] and evaluates the disorder - average by the replica method . whereas other workers @xcite then used the replicated field theory to derive scaling equations for variables including the mean disorder strength , dotsenko argued that one should look for spatially localized energetically _ unstable _ configurations of the replicated field theory , which correspond to local maxima of the replicated action and are to be identified with the droplets discussed above .",
    "dotsenko shows that the leading nonanalytic contribution to the free energy in the vicinity of an assumed @xmath183 critical point comes from droplets with size of the order of the magnetic correlation length , @xmath9 ; we refer to these henceforth as typical droplets. the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite assume that the @xmath261 limit of this classical theory may be straightforwardly taken , and then add to this theory estimates of the dynamics of typical droplets .",
    "the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite disagree in a number of specific details with the results presented here , including for example the way in which the bare tunnelling rate is estimated .",
    "the most important difference , however , is in the interpretation of the results . ref .",
    "@xcite argues that one should identify the boundary of the griffiths region with the value of @xmath262 at which a typical droplet ceases to tunnel .",
    "our analysis , which involves averaging over all droplets , indicates that independent of whether the typical droplet ( however defined ) may tunnel , the susceptibility is dominated by droplets which are at or beyond the edge of ceasing to tunnel ; these give an essentially superparamagnetic ( @xmath228 ) behavior , instead of the continuously varying exponent characteristic of quantum griffiths behavior .",
    "@xcite presented a detailed analysis of a different model in which spins are added to a pure system which itself is far from any critical point . in this model",
    "the phase transition is _ disorder - driven _ :",
    "it occurs when the density of added spins is high enough that these order ; whereas our interest here has been in models in which even the non - disordered system is near a critical point .",
    "further in the model studied in  @xcite the way the disorder is introduced means that the local spin amplitude @xmath96 ( c.f our eq .",
    "[ phi3d ] ) is always of order unity , whereas in our treatment the local spin amplitude may be considerably smaller .",
    "an approximate mapping between the model considered in @xcite and the one considered here may be obtained by setting our parameters @xmath96 and @xmath9 equal to unity and considering the behavior as the disorder strength @xmath88 is increased ( whereas we consider a fixed @xmath88 and study the behavior as @xmath9 is increased ) .",
    "although specific details differ , in a broad qualitative sense results obtained in ref @xcite are similar to those obtained here . in particular ,",
    "ref @xcite states that at sufficiently low temperature dissipation will suppress the quantum griffiths behavior .",
    "however , ref @xcite argued that in an extremely wide temperature regime could exist in which behavior characteristic of the undamped system occurs , whereas in the model we consider , for any reasonable parameters there is no such temperature regime .",
    "a crucial point is that @xcite focussed on model parameters such that the damping coefficient was extremely weak ( i.e in our notations ( see below eq .",
    "[ gamma ] ) they took @xmath263 ) . in this limit , it is plausible that there is a temperature regime in which behavior characteristic of the undamped model may occur , before finally a crossover occurs to a regime ( similar to the one we considered ) in which damping is important .",
    "important avenues for future investigation include more detailed studies of the crossovers between the weak - damping and order unity damping cases and between the disorder driven - criticality effects studied in @xcite and the pure system criticality - driven effects studied here , as well as determination of the damping coefficient values appropriate to the heavy fermion materials of interest .",
    "our work has the following implications for experiment .",
    "first , the canonical quantum griffiths effects are due to weak disorder added to a pure critical point .",
    "we have shown that in the limit of weak disorder and a pure critical point described by the hertz theory @xcite , the dissipation characteristic of metallic systems changes the quantum griffiths singularities into a kind of superparamagnetic behavior . in other words , as a matter of principle the canonically defined quantum griffiths behavior should _ not _ be observable in metals near magnetic quantum critical points .",
    "this suggests that claims @xcite to have observed quantum griffiths behavior in heavy fermion systems should be treated with caution ( at least for systems with ising symmetry ) .",
    "further , we showed that the droplets which dominate the susceptibility can tunnel only when the system is not close to criticality , and in these cases the droplet size is not much larger than the basic scale of the theory .",
    "thus if the susceptibility is dominated by the tunnelling of droplets , the picture which emerges is more similar to the kondo disorder picture of @xcite than it is to the conventionally - defined quantum griffiths picture .",
    "indeed , the experimental claims involve heavy fermion systems where the interaction which favors a non - magnetic phase is the kondo effect .",
    "as noted by many authors @xcite , the fact that kondo temperatures are exponentially sensitive to system parameters means that a slight variation in system parameters can lead to a wide variation in kondo temperatures .",
    "the canonical assumption of weak disorder which we and others @xcite have made may not be valid for these systems .",
    "the interplay between quantum criticality and a broad distribution of disorder should be treatable by the methods introduced here , and seems worth examining .",
    "a second point is that the very slow dynamics of the droplets makes it much easier for them to order .",
    "further , in a metallic system the droplet - droplet interactions are of long range ( see , e.g. @xcite for a discussion in the context of the two dimensional metal insulator transition ) .",
    "for this reason we expect that in the presence of disorder the actual phase transition at which long ranged order sets in is an essentially classical affair , in which droplets lock together when the temperature becomes lower than some droplet - droplet coupling .    a third point , perhaps relevant beyond the present context",
    ", is that ( as seen for example in eq [ sinstz2 ] ) dissipation can have a crucial effect on bare tunnelling rates : in the metallic problem we considered the cruical impediment to tunnelling of a droplet was found to be the viscosity of the medium , not the energy barrier which had to be surmounted .",
