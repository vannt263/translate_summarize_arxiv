    "there exists a @xmath16-invariant set @xmath147 consisting of disjoint disks which contains all singularities of @xmath112 .",
    "since @xmath112 satisfies @xmath148 by ( [ 3 ] ) , it follows that @xmath149 as before this is incompatible with @xmath145 and @xmath150 as @xmath125 .",

    "applying fatou s theorem to the map @xmath174 , we deduce that @xmath115 and thus @xmath114 has at most two attracting fixed points .",
    "if @xmath106 is disconnected , we apply fatou s theorem separately to each component that contains an attracting fixed point . as the @xmath113-image of an attracting fixed point of @xmath88",

    "let @xmath177 be the jacobian determinant of @xmath178 .",
    "then @xmath179 is the set where @xmath178 preserves the orientation and @xmath180 is the set where @xmath178 reverses the orientation .",
    "as @xmath178 has one pole , a point @xmath181 of large modulus has one preimage on @xmath0 and the map is reversing orientation at this preimage .",
    "we conclude that the degree of @xmath178 equals @xmath182 ; see  @xcite for the definition of the degree .",

    "then @xmath188 equals the degree of @xmath178 so that @xmath189 and thus @xmath190 for the number @xmath191 of fixed points of @xmath88 in @xmath0 we thus find that @xmath192    since @xmath177 , the zeros of @xmath178 in @xmath186 are attracting fixed points of @xmath88 while the zeros of @xmath178 in @xmath187 are repelling fixed points of  @xmath88 .",
    "thus lemma  [ lemma4 ] yields that @xmath193 it follows from   and   that @xmath194 .",
    "on the other hand , since @xmath178 is odd and @xmath16-periodic it easily follows that that the half - periods @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 are zeros of  @xmath178 .",
    "equivalently , they are fixed points of  @xmath88 .",
    "thus we have @xmath198 .",

    "suppose first that all three half - periods are in @xmath187 ; that is , they are repelling fixed points of  @xmath88",
    ". then @xmath202 .",
    "this yields that @xmath203 and @xmath204 so that @xmath201 by   and  .",
    "suppose now that one half - period , say @xmath205 , is not in @xmath187 and thus in @xmath186 .",
    "thus @xmath205 is an attracting fixed point of @xmath88 and hence attracts a critical orbit by fatou s theorem .",
    "however , since @xmath88 is odd we see that @xmath205 in fact attracts both critical orbits .",
    "thus , by fatou s theorem , there are no other attracting fixed points . thus @xmath206 and hence @xmath200 in this case .",
    "we see that @xmath200 if and only if there exists @xmath24 such that @xmath205 is an attracting fixed point of @xmath88 ; that is , @xmath207 .",
    "using   this takes the form @xmath208 now   yields @xmath209 and @xmath210 substituting the last two equations in   yields @xmath211 this is equivalent to strict inequality in  .",
    "this completes the proof of the theorem in the case that all zeros of @xmath178 are in @xmath183 .    to deal with the case where this condition is not satisfied",
    ", we note that in the above arguments we may replace @xmath212 by @xmath213 for any @xmath214 .",
    "noting that @xmath178 and @xmath215 have the same jacobian determinant we conclude that whenever all @xmath181-points of @xmath178 are in @xmath183 , then @xmath178 has either three or five @xmath181-points in  @xmath0 .",
