    "dirac semimetals ( dsms ) and weyl semimetals ( wsms ) are electronic states of matter characterized by the existence of three - dimensional dirac nodes@xcite . unlike in three dimensional ( 3d ) dsms , weyl nodes of opposing chirality in wsms are separated in momentum space . as such",
    ", they act as sources and sinks of berry curvature.@xcite wsms have been likened@xcite to `` 3d graphene '' , but also exhibit a range of fascinating properties not observed in graphene or other topological semimetallic systems  such as the chiral anomaly in transport@xcite and the appearance of open surface fermi arcs in photoemission measurements.@xcite the latter are the result of topologically - protected chiral states connecting bulk weyl nodes of opposite chirality , projected onto the surface .",
    "information about the bulk topology can therefore be obtained from the surface - projected fermi arcs .",
    "such topological properties are predicted to be robust to weak perturbations , including disorder from dilute impurities,@xcite since the weyl nodes can only be annihilated in pairs of opposite chirality.@xcite    a family of wsms was predicted from band structure calculations in the monopnictide class@xcite  and very recently weyl fermion states have been discovered experimentally in the noncentrosymmetric ( but time - reversal invariant ) materials taas , nbas , tap and nbp.@xcite in particular , surface fermi arcs have been observed in angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments carried out for these systems .",
    "more recently , it was appreciated that condensed matter weyl cones , in contrast to fundamentally relativistic dirac / weyl fermions , do not have to be perfectly isotropic .",
    "they can be either slightly tilted  @xcite or even tipped  @xcite , in the latter case leading to electron and hole fermi surfaces coexisting with the weyl touching points .",
    "the latter systems are commonly referred to as weyl fermions type ii  @xcite . obviously , this can lead to considerably more complicated situations for instance",
    "if disorder is present and in principle nodal quasiparticles can scatter resonantly to electron or hole fermi pockets .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effect of a finite tilt in weyl systems on the optical conductivity ( here our result is also valid for type ii ) as well as the polarization .",
    "our main finding is that the optical conductivity to a large extent is not altered by the existence of a finite tilt and does not show a strong directional dependence ; the signature of the tilt vanishes completely in the extreme optical limit , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath0 .",
    "the polarization , on the other hand , shows directional dependence .",
    "we furthermore study the effects of coulomb interactions in such systems and contrast them from the standard isotropic case .",
    "our main finding is that asymptotically the system recovers isotropy in the low - energy limit .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : we start with introducing the minimal model sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ; from there we move towards the optical conductivity in sec .",
    "[ sec : optcon ] and the polarization function in sec .",
    "[ sec : polfun ] . finally , we discuss the renormalization due to interactions in sec .",
    "[ sec : renorm ] and finish with a discussion and conclusion in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "the starting point for our investigations is given by two tilted weyl cone parametrized by the bloch hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a unit vector ( @xmath3=1 ) , @xmath4 is a dimensionless parameter measuring the tilt , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are unit matrices while @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the standard pauli matrices .",
    "the eigenvalues are doubly degenerate and given by @xmath9 the density of states remains semi - metallic as long as @xmath10 and becomes metallic for @xmath11 . a finite tilt term , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath12 can not be added without breaking time reversal symmetry in a realistic model of two dirac cones as can easily be shown by a symmetry analysis .",
    "the present implementation also breaks inversion symmetry ; a version which does not break inversion symmetry is given by a tilt term of the form @xmath13 ( note that this still breaks time reversal symmetry ) .",
    "the optical conductivity is the response to an applied electric field which varies periodically in time .",
    "it is material characteristic and has been studied for untilted 3d dirac / weyl fermions extensively . in the presence of a finite tilt",
    ", the naive expectation is that there is a natural bias towards the tilt direction .",
    "the real part of the optical conductivity in general is given by @xmath14 in imaginary time formalism the linear response kernel for hamiltonian , eq .",
    ", in the absence of interactions and disorder , reads ( see appendix  [ app : optcon ] for a derivation of the current vertex )    @xmath15   \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is integer ) , @xmath19 .",
    "we obtain @xmath20 by means of analytic continuation via @xmath21 .",
    "the green function itself standardly is given by @xmath22    we distinguish two response functions , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , where the former is the response if the electric field is applied along the tilting direction , while the latter corresponds to a field in the plane perpendicular to @xmath2 . after a series of manipulations ( for details of the calculation",
    "see appendix  [ app : optcon ] ) we can bring them into the compact form @xmath25 and @xmath26 both integrals only depend on two dimensionless parameters , @xmath27 and @xmath4 ( note @xmath28 ) .",
    "one interesting observation is that in the limit @xmath29 the two components of the optical conductivity , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , do not depend on the tilt anymore . to see this we note that in this limit we can approximate the fermi function @xmath32 as a step function ; consequently , the optical conductivities simplify and are given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 note that this formula reproduces the result of the untilted case  @xcite for all values of @xmath10 . while this independence of the tilt sounds surprising , there is an intuitive picture .",
    "the optical conductivity probes the transitions of electrons from the valence to the conduction band caused by external electromagnetic radiation ; it exchanges an energy @xmath35 and a momentum @xmath36 with an electron in the valence band thereby exciting it into the conduction band .",
    "( red ) and @xmath37 ( yellow ) and their projection on the @xmath38 plane.,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( red ) and @xmath37 ( yellow ) and their projection on the @xmath38 plane.,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( red ) and @xmath37 ( yellow ) and their projection on the @xmath38 plane.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for untilted cones , the number of states that can undergo such a transitions are those lying on the circular region corresponding to an energy @xmath39 , which will get excited to the region at energy @xmath40 .",
    "since this process does not involve momentum transfer the transition corresponds to a vertical `` jump '' .",
    "this essentially measures the density of states @xmath41 integrated along a ring , leading to eq .",
    "and eq .  . + if we now consider the additional tilting term , the states that can be excited from valence to conduction band lie on an ellipsoid , tilted itself .",
    "the number of states is given by the line integral over the region of the density of states , and this latter changes along the ellipse .",
    "the two effects , length of the region and varying density of states , compensate each other in such a way that only the projection of the shaded areas onto the @xmath38 plane matters .",
    "+ we conclude that the optical conductivity does not change as long as the weyl cone is not tilted over , _",
    "i.e. _ , as long as @xmath10 ( even for general values of @xmath27 the conductivity is only very weakly dependent on the tilt @xmath4 ) .",
    "the retarded polarization function @xmath42 is given as the density - density correlation function  @xcite . at zero temperature the full expression for the polarization function reads    @xmath43    where @xmath44 corresponds to a momentum cutoff which has to be introduced to regularize the integral ( details of the calculation are relegated to appendix  [ app : polfun ] ) . the imaginary part which is related to the spectrum of the polarization",
    "is given by @xmath45 in contrast to the optical conductivity , this quantity shows directional dependence even at zero temperature .",
    "this can be traced back to the fact that we are looking for a response at finite external momentum .",
    "we can again decompose the spectrum into a perpendicular and parallel component given by @xmath46 just like in the case of the optical conductivity we reproduce the zero - tilt result known from the literature  * ? ? ?",
    "we evaluate the polarizability from @xmath103 \\big[(i\\omega_m + i\\nu -t\\mathbf{d}\\cdot(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q } ) ) ^2 - |\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}|^2 \\big ] } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and using standard manipulations we canbring it into the form @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the angle between vectors @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "we notice that at zero temperature due to @xmath10 none of the occupation numbers are changed by the tilt , so we can set the tilt @xmath74 in the nominator .",
    "we can also switch the external frequency @xmath108 to get rid of the tilt inside the integrand completely .",
    "what remains is the untilted weyl fermion polarization function at zero chemical potential and zero temperature , which can be calculated in a standard way .",
    "then we switch the variables back to finally obtain the retarded polarization function , @xmath109 where the remaining steps leading to eq .",
    "are elementary and thus not shown explicitly .",
    "coulomb interactions in graphene are marginally irrelevant from a perturbative point of view  @xcite .",
    "their main effect is to renormalize the fermi velocity upwards upon decreasing the energy scale .",
    "this picture has recently seen confirmation in experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , from a strong coupling perspective there is room for a phase with broken symmetry and a dynamically generated excitonic gap  @xcite and currently experiments are currently trying to find the so - called chiral symmetry breaking in ever cleaner samples .",
    "three dimensional dirac theories are fundamentally different in the sense that in the massless case one can associate a topological charge with the two weyl nodes of opposing chirality . the only way to gap the isolated weyl nodes is by merging them thereby annihilating their charges . on a more technical level , two dimensional representations of dirac nodes , _",
    "i.e. _ , weyl nodes in 3d exhaust all pauli matrices and therefore any mass term added can be compensated for by a shift of the momentum coordinate  @xcite . in dsms",
    "an even number of two dimensional representations of the dirac theory ( weyl nodes ) are degenerate in energy and momentum space and so no momentum transfer is required to annihilate them , meaning any coupling of the two nodes can gap them rendering them unstable . concerning interactions , in principle the same physics as in graphene can be expected and also a symmetry broken gapped phase is possible with a mass term connecting the two chiral nodes .",
    "this has to be contrasted from wsms which possess an intrinsic stability against many - body interactions .",
    "weyl nodes are single two - dimensional representations of dirac theories and their respective partners live in different locations in momentum space .",
    "this implies that a single weyl cone can not be gapped due to a simple mass term without a large momentum transfer .",
    "long - range coulomb interaction in principle is able to connect two weyl cones thereby dynamically generating a mass . in three dimensions inelastic coulomb scattering decays @xmath47 in momentum space .",
    "if the weyl nodes are separated by a distance @xmath48 in momentum space this suppresses internodal scattering , in perfect analogy to intervalley scattering in graphene .",
    "this implies that an even stronger coulomb interaction than in graphene is required to generate a mass , which makes it very unlikely to occur .",
    "for that reason we refrain from studying the possibility of dynamic mass generation but instead focus on perturbative effects of coulomb interaction assuming we do not connect / merge the two weyl cones of opposing chirality .    in order to study the effects of coulomb interactions we use the perturbative renormalization group .",
    "it turns out that a modification of the more standard momentum shell scheme is more tailored towards the tilted cones : we integrate out excitations within an energy shell since there is no one - to - one correspondence between momentum and energy anymore once the cones are tilted  @xcite .",
    "our starting point is the following hamiltonian @xmath49 where double indices @xmath50 are summed over and denote the number of weyl nodes in the system ( which we assume to have the same tilting ) .",
    "furthermore , in writing this form of the coulomb interaction we explicitly assume that there is no internodal scattering , justified by assuming the nodes are far away from each other in momentum space . in eq .  , @xmath51 is the product of the vacuum dielectric constant and the medium one , respectively .",
    "the interaction term introduced in the hamiltonian describes an instantaneous interaction between the electric charges , thus we are neglecting any retardation effect that could come from the propagation of the photon field .",
    "the approximation is justified provided that @xmath52 , which will generically be the case ( in graphene , for instance , @xmath53 ) .",

    ", these equations faithfully reproduce the renormalization flow in the untilted case for @xmath74  @xcite    in total we thus find that the fine structure constant flows to zero for low - energies , meaning asymptotically , the theory is non - interacting .",
    "furthermore , the fermi velocity @xmath64 renormalizes to higher values , while the tilt vanishes , thereby restoring isotropy of the theory .",
    "in this paper we studied the effect of a tilt term added to a weyl node in observable quantities such as the optical conductivity and the polarization function .",
    "we found that in the extreme optical limit , _",

    "our main finding is that in the limit of low energies the theory becomes asymptotically isotropic again .",
