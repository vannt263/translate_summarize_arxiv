    "in an elegant paper  @xcite takayanagi has recently proposed an extension of the ads / cft conjecture  @xcite to deal with the situation , when the cft is defined on a space with a boundary .",
    "these so called boundary cft s , or bcft s , naturally appear in various applications to condensed matter phenomena .",
    "the main idea behind the takayanagi s construction is to appropriately extend the boundary of the cft inside the bulk of the @xmath6 space in order to cut out a physically relevant piece .",
    "the ads / bcft conjecture finds its natural roots in the holographic derivation of entanglement entropy  @xcite and in the randall - sundrum model  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the extension of the cft s boundary inside the bulk of the @xmath6-space may be regarded as a modification of a `` thin '' randall - sundrum brane , intersecting the @xmath6 boundary .",
    "for this brane to be a dynamical object one must impose neumann boundary conditions on the metric ; then , the discontinuity in the bulk extrinsic curvature across the `` defect '' will be compensated by the brane s tension .",
    "thus , neumann boundary conditions constitute the dynamical principle defining the additional boundaries introduced by takayanagi . in the following",
    "we will often refer to these boundaries as to randall - sundrum ( rs ) branes .    from the point of view of the ads / cft applications",
    "it is interesting to see how the addition of the boundaries affects physical behavior . in particular",
    ", it would be interesting to construct a solution describing a physical system at finite temperature and charge density .",
    "the most common playground is provided by the charged @xmath7 black hole since this background has been already shown to encode many interesting condensed - matter - like phenomena such as superconductivity / superfluidity  @xcite and strange metallic behavior  @xcite . here , we shall analyze the charged @xmath7 black hole in the presence of boundaries .",
    "a model of gauge fields in the @xmath7 background with boundary rs branes has been already considered by fujita , kaminski and karch in  @xcite , who showed that the additional boundary conditions impose relevant constraints on the gauge field parameters and that , as a consequence of those constraints , there is the possibility of quantum - hall - like behavior of the conductivity in the dual field theory .",
    "however , their approach  @xcite does not account for the backreaction of the gauge fields on the geometry , restricting to the geometry of the empty @xmath6 space",
    ". a natural generalization of their work would be to extend their analysis to the case of a charged black hole . in this paper",
    "we make a first step in this direction .",
    "the physical system analyzed in this paper is based on the model proposed by fujita _",
    "indeed , we start from the same lagrangian for an einstein - maxwell system describing the gravity dual of a field theory on a half - plane .",
    "we find that , for the simple plane - symmetric black hole ansatz , only tensionless rs branes are allowed and that the background solution does not allow to model the situation with external electric fields as in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as a result of the neumann boundary conditions for the gauge fields , we find that the charge density @xmath8 in the dual field theory must be supported by an external magnetic field @xmath9 . the ratio @xmath10 , which is equal to the hall conductivity , is a constant inversely proportional to the sum of the coefficients of the topological terms present in the gravity action : namely , a @xmath11-term in the bulk action and a chern - simons term in the boundary action on the rs branes .",
    "in addition , we get zero longitudinal conductivity .",
    "all these behaviors are expected for a quantum hall system tuned to a quantized value of the conductivity .    in the classical hall effect",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are independent quantities , _",
    "e.g. _ their ratio is a function of the density of conductance electrons @xmath8 . in the quantum hall effect ( qhe )",
    "the transverse conductivity @xmath12 , exhibits plateaus independent of either @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "the plateaus are generally attributed to disorder  @xcite , which is responsible for localization ( _ i.e. _ existence of localized electron states ) .",
    "the localized states fill the gaps between the landau levels , but do not participate in the hall conductivity . in other words , even if one varies the density of conductance electrons , so that the fermi energy shifts in the gap between the landau levels , the conductivity does not change . for the same reason the longitudinal components of the conductivity vanish .",
    "an important aspect of the qhe is the quantization of the conductivity plateaus in integer ( integer qhe ) or fractional ( fractional qhe ) numbers of flux quanta @xmath13 .",
    "the mechanisms of the integer and fractional quantization are , however , different : while the fractional quantization is due to the interaction between electrons  @xcite , the integer qhe ( iqhe ) exists even for a non - interacting electron gas with disorder and is a consequence of gauge invariance  @xcite . in the widely accepted composite fermion model the fractional qhe ( fqhe )",
    "may be regarded as an iqhe for composite quasiparticles of fractional charge  @xcite .",
    "it is by now well understood that the fqhe is effectively described by chern - simons gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as explicitly seen in computations of the gauge effective action of planar electrodynamics  @xcite , the hall relation @xmath14 can be derived from the chern - simons lagrangian with @xmath12 being a constant inversely proportional to the chern - simons level @xmath15 .",
    "if , for some reason , @xmath15 is constrained to take integer values ( for details , see  @xcite ) , the conductivity would be also quantized .    the general philosophy of the ads / bcft correspondence leads naturally to a generalization of the chern - simons description of the qhe . indeed , the neumann boundary condition for the gauge fields , derived by fujita _ et .",
    "_ , turns out to be a covariant `` holographic '' form of the hall relation .",
    "furthermore , in the ads / bcft formulation , the chern - simons theory lives on the rs branes cutting the bulk of the @xmath6 space and the holographic hall relation potentially leads to a more interesting dependence of @xmath12 on various topological coefficients  @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is to ascertain whether and how models using the ads / bcft correspondence may be made consistent with the physics underlying the integer or the fractional qhe .",
    "since the classical gravity limits of the holographic correspondence enable to describe strongly coupled gauge theories one may naively expect that the ads / bcft correspondence may provide us with an appropriate description of the fqhe .",
    "this naive expectation is supported by the study in  @xcite , which revealed a non - fermi liquid behavior of the charged @xmath7 black hole .",
    "in addition , the gravity solution describes a `` clean '' system , where disorder has still to be introduced . in this paper",
    "we provide a further analysis of the physical consequences stemming from the @xmath6 black hole solution with the aim of elucidating its relationship with realistic quantum hall systems .    one way to test",
    "how fractional is the qhe is to look at the behavior of the heat conductivities . for a non - interacting electron gas",
    "the heat conductivity is related to the electric conductivity through the wiedemann - franz law . for interacting electrons , _",
    "i.e. _ for the fqhe , the wiedemann - franz law is violated  @xcite and the ratio of the transverse heat and electric conductivities becomes a non - trivial function of the filling fraction , which may yield zero , or negative , heat conductivities .",
    "our analysis of the low temperature behavior of the transverse thermal conductivities shows that the @xmath7 black hole is perfectly consistent with the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "in particular , the @xmath16 coefficient of the ratio , the lorenz number , is precisely @xmath17 ; a well known result for non - interacting electrons .",
    "another characteristic feature of quantum hall systems is the emergence of current - carrying edge states , extending along the perimeter of the sample  @xcite .",
    "their existence is due to the fact that , at the edges , there is a confining potential , preventing the electrons from leaving the sample and locally raising the energy of the landau levels . as a result , while the system remains gapped ( incompressible ) far from the edges , there is no gap at the edges .",
    "the edge states may then be regarded as the massless modes arising at the intersection of the fermi energy with the filled landau levels .",
    "below , we show that the edge currents do not appear for a black hole solution with tensionless rs branes .",
    "in addition , we argue that there is an edge current whenever the tension of the rs branes is different from zero .",
    "this observation is consistent with the fact that a non - vanishing tension should represent a system with a geometry - induced gap in the `` bulk '' of the sample .",
    "our analysis hints to the fact that a black hole solution with tensionless rs branes may only describe the situation where the difference between the fermi energy and the nearest landau level is smaller than the temperature and , thus , it is expected to be rather unstable against thermal fluctuations .",
    "although the behavior found for the conductivities and the absence of a gap seem to be in contrast with our expectations for a quantum hall system , we believe that this only hints to the instability of the gravity solution with tensionless rs branes . we feel that a more appropriate solution would be the one with non - vanishing tension of the rs branes ; unfortunately , an explicit form of such a solution is still lacking .",
    "we expect that this solution will modify the result for conductivities and may lead to a violation of the wiedemann - franz law ; a preliminary analysis indicates , indeed , that rs branes with tension enable to describe situations where the electric conductivity is quantized and the tension is related to the fermi energy , rather than being an independent parameter .",
    "alternatively , it is interesting to understand how disorder may be introduced in a ads / bcft model describing the iqhe .",
    "there already exists an extensive literature on the application of holographic correspondence to quantum hall physics .",
    "here we will take advantage of the computation of the transport coefficients carried by hartnoll and kovtun for the dyonic @xmath7 black hole  @xcite and further elaborated in  @xcite .",
    "we also stress that the ads / bcft model analyzed in this paper is reminiscent of some recent top - down stringy constructions  @xcite . for more details",
    "we refer the reader to these papers .",
    "the presentation of our results is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : setup ]",
    "we review the ads / bcft construction in the particular setup studied in  @xcite . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we investigate the black hole solution constrained by the additional boundary conditions required by the ads / bcft construction .",
    "section  [ sec : conductivities ] is devoted to the discussion of the electric and thermal conductivities .",
    "the computation of the edge currents is the main topic of section  [ sec : edgecurrents ] . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we provide a critical summary of our results .",
    "we aim at studying a gravity dual of a @xmath0-dimensional system with finite temperature and charge density living on a space @xmath18 with a boundary which , for the sake of simplicity , will be taken in the following sections as a half plane or a strip . since systems at finite temperature and charge density may be dually described by charged black holes , we can describe the bulk using the abelian einstein - maxwell action .",
    "namely , one may start with [ bulkaction ] s_n = _ n^4 x ( r-2 ) - _",
    "n^4 xf_f^+_n ff . following  @xcite",
    "we denote with @xmath19 the bulk space , with @xmath20 the determinant of the bulk metric @xmath21 and with @xmath22 the cosmological constant . in the following we set the gravitational constant @xmath23 and the @xmath24 coupling @xmath25 ; the only role of @xmath26",
    "will be then to define the probe limit @xmath27 , in which the backreaction of the matter fields on the gravity solution can be ignored .",
    "since the last term in the bulk action is topological , it does not affect the equations of motion ; however , it is relevant for the analysis of the boundary conditions .",
    "the bulk equations of motion may then be rewritten as [ einstein ] r _ - g _ - g _",
    "= f_f_^ - g_f_f^ , [ maxwell ] ^f _ = 0 .    the dual theory lives on a @xmath0 dimensional space @xmath18 with a boundary which , following  @xcite , we denote with @xmath28 . for a proper definition of the holographic model it is natural to require that this @xmath29 dimensional boundary is extended to the bulk to make a @xmath0 dimensional hypersurface @xmath30  @xcite , so that @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "according to takayanagi , for this hypersurface @xmath30 to be dynamical , one needs to introduce the following boundary action on @xmath30 [ qaction ] s_q = _ q ^3 x(k - ) + s_q[matter ] , where @xmath33 is the determinant of the induced metric @xmath34 on the boundary @xmath30 and @xmath35 is the extrinsic curvature on @xmath30 .",
    "we denote by @xmath36 the corresponding cosmological constant , which may also be regarded as the tension of the brane @xmath30 . in the following",
    "we shall use @xmath37 only to account for the temperature of the dual field theory . as pointed out in the introduction ,",
    "the boundary @xmath30 plays a role analogous to the cutoff branes in the randall - sundrum model ; in the following , we shall refer to the additional boundaries required by the ads / bcft construction as rs branes .    to have a well - defined variational principle on a space with boundaries one needs to specify the boundary conditions .",
    "variation of the bulk  ( [ bulkaction ] ) plus boundary  ( [ qaction ] ) action in response to a variation of the metric yields the following boundary term [ gvariation ] ( s_n+s_q)[g _ ] = _ q ^3 x ( k_ab-(k-)h_ab)h^ab - _ q ^3 x t_abh^ab , where @xmath38 is the boundary stress - energy tensor : t_ab = -s_q[matter ] .",
    "for the variation to vanish one could impose a dirichlet boundary condition on the metric @xmath39 .",
    "however , if @xmath30 has to be determined dynamically , one should employ neumann boundary conditions .",
    "namely , one should require that [ neumann - metric ] k_ab-(k-)h_ab= t_ab . as a result the shape of @xmath30 and",

    "we shall analyze the solutions to the equations of motion  ( [ einstein ] ) and  ( [ maxwell ] ) constrained by the neumann boundary conditions  ( [ neumann - metric ] ) and  ( [ neumann - gauge0 ] ) . here",
    ", we would like to complete the analysis of the gravity action needed by the ads / bcft construction .",
    "namely , the variation of the action gets contributions also from the boundary @xmath18 where , in accordance with the general lore of the ads / cft correspondence , one must impose dirichlet boundary conditions . following the standard procedure  @xcite we introduce the following counter terms to render the action finite , [ counterterms ] s_m = _",

    "@xmath41 is the determinant of the induced metric on @xmath18 , which is fixed by the dirichlet boundary conditions to be the minkowski metric @xmath42 of the dual gauge theory .",

    "i.e. _ for the gravity solution with zero tension of the rs brane analyzed in this paper ( figure  [ fig : gap](a ) ) , there is no geometric gap in the  bulk \" of the conductor , but rather an infinite gap at the edges ; of course , the edge current is zero in this situation . when @xmath110 , the gap is position dependent and the total edge current diffuses over a characteristic region @xmath111 ( figure  [ fig : gap](b ) ) set by the cutoff scale @xmath53 .",
    "the absence of edge currents when the rs brane is tensionless indicates that the ads / bcft black hole solution analyzed in this paper does not give a full description of a realistic quantum hall system since there is no scale in the geometric description that can be associated with the energy gap needed to describe the bulk of a quantum hall system .",
    "however , even when the rs brane is tensionless , the hall conductivity still exhibits a plateau .",
    "the `` unphysical '' behavior the ads / bcft model with tensionless rs brane is likely to indicate its instability . indeed a more general profile of the rs brane should have the shape illustrated by figure  [ fig : gap](d )",
    ". it would be interesting to find such tensionful solutions and analyze their stability .    for solutions of the type depicted on figure  [ fig : gap](d )",
    "we expect that the tension is not a free parameter , but is dynamically related to the fermi energy and to the scale @xmath112 ( position of the closest approach of the brane @xmath30 to the horizon ) .",
    "the variation of the chemical potential will then correspond to the variation of @xmath112 , with @xmath113 as @xmath56 increases . at some value of the chemical potential",
    "one should have @xmath114 and the gap will close . in this respect",
    "the solution in figure  [ fig : gap](a ) looks like a metastable branch of the profile in figure  [ fig : gap](d ) for @xmath115 .    since the `` bulk '' of the sample in the configuration depicted in figure  [ fig : gap](d ) is gapped just as it happens for the background geometry  ( [ qprofilet ] ) with non - zero tension ( @xmath103 ) of the rs brane , we expect to observe currents at the edges",
    ". it would be interesting to further understand the edge effects in such a configuration .",
    "naively , one should expect that the conductivity is a function of @xmath66 near the edges , varying between the @xmath71 value ( @xmath116 ) and @xmath54 value ( @xmath117 )",
    ". it would be interesting to ascertain whether this feature has any relationship with quantum hall samples , where stripes of different filling fraction may appear close to the edges  @xcite .",
    "transport at the edges may exhibit other very interesting phenomena .",
    "in particular , the existence of `` upstream '' modes was conjectured in  @xcite ; these modes should carry charge in the direction opposite to the classical skipping orbits typical of electrons in a magnetic field .",
    "although no charge - carrying upstream modes has been detected experimentally , the heat transport in the upstream direction has been already observed  @xcite .",
    "this effect leads to a violation of the wiedemann - franz law  ( [ wflaw ] ) .",
    "the violation is a result of the electron interaction : in a state with a fractional value of the filling fraction @xmath118 ( fqhe ) the modified wiedemann - franz law can be written as [ wflaw2 ] = _ qt , where @xmath119 is a function of @xmath118 , which equals unity on integer values . for fractional values of @xmath118 the function @xmath120 and may vanish or become negative  @xcite . in the previous section we obtained @xmath121 for a background geometry with zero tension of the rs brane ; this points to the fact that this geometry may enable to describe a non - interacting system ( iqhe ) once disorder is included in the ads / bcft construction .",
    "nevertheless , since we expect that solutions with non - vanishing tension of the rs brane will modify the computations of the conductivities ( in the most naive form we can expect that the ratio in  ( [ wflaw ] ) will be @xmath66-dependent , ) our ads / bcft approach may yield other solutions violating the wiedmann - franz law .",
    "we analyzed an ads / bcft model of a condensed matter system at finite temperature and charge density living on a @xmath0-dimensional space with a boundary .",
    "it turns out that a straightforward generalization of a known ads / cft solution , such as the plane - symmetric charged @xmath7 black hole , only allows for tensionless rs branes in the ads / bcft construction and requires that the static uniform charge density is supported by a magnetic field .",
    "specifically , we found that @xmath10 is a constant proportional to a ratio of the coefficients appearing in the gravity action .",
    "such a property indicates that a pertinent generalization of the @xmath7 black hole may describe a quantum hall system at a plateau of the transverse conductivity .",
    "we provided further tests of the ads / bcft holographic model to see how accurately it can account for the physical behaviors expected in a quantum hall system . the ads / bcft construction yields that the hall conductivity is inversely proportional to a sum of the coefficients of the topological terms appearing in the gravity lagrangian .",
    "namely , we got that [ sigmahall ] _",
    "h==- , c_2= + . here",
    "@xmath15 is the level of the chern - simons term on the boundary and @xmath11 is the bulk @xmath66-angle . in the qhe",
    "the conductivity is related to the number of filled landau levels ( filling fraction ) by = _",
    "-2 , where @xmath122 is the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "thus , the holographic description seems to provide results similar to the chern - simons description of the qhe .    as in the chern - simons description  @xcite , in the ads / bcft model",
    "the filling is inversely proportional to the level of the chern - simons theory .",
    "indeed equation  ( [ neumann - gauge0 ] ) comes from the variation of the chern - simons lagrangian , which lives on the rs brane @xmath30 .",
    "it can be seen as an extension of the covariant form of the hall relation @xmath14 .",
    "however , in the holographic ads / bcft model , the conductivity receives a contribution also from the bulk @xmath66-term , resulting in a renormalization of the chern - simons coefficient .    in the qhe ,",
    "the filling fraction is quantized .",
    "it may take either integer ( iqhe ) or special fractional ( fqhe ) values . from the point of view of the chern - simons description , quantization of the filling fraction",
    "signifies quantization of the chern - simons coefficient . unlike the non - abelian case",
    ", there is no _ a priori _ quantization of the abelian chern - simons coefficient . nevertheless , in some cases , like compact manifolds , or finite temperature ,",
    "it can be argued to take integer or rational values , _",
    "e.g. _ see  @xcite . as pointed out in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "the boundary conditions effectively make the manifold @xmath18 topologically equivalent to a compact one .",
    "thus , the ads / bcft holographic model rather easily yields the integer quantization of the chern - simons level @xmath15 which , in turn , leads to fractional values of the filling fraction and conductivity in the appropriate units .",
    "the computation of the electrical and thermal conductivities in the ads / bcft model with tensionless rs branes goes along the same lines as in  @xcite .",
    "equipped with the result of  @xcite we observed here that , at low temperatures , the coefficient of the leading @xmath16 term yields precisely one quantum of the transverse heat conductance per quantum of the transverse electric conductance .",
    "that is the conductances satisfy the wiedemann - franz law for a non - interacting electron gas  ( [ wflaw ] )",
    ".    quantum hall systems also exhibit currents running along the edges of the sample .",
    "ln section  [ sec : edgecurrents ] we derived an expression for the edge current , which is consistent with conventional wisdom : namely , the current is proportional to the chemical potential and to the conductivity , while its existence is associated to the existence of a gap in the `` bulk '' of the sample .",
    "since the charged black hole solution with a tensionless rs brane analyzed in this paper can not describe a gapped system , we find no edge current .",
    "we conclude that such a black hole does not describe completely a realistic quantum hall system ; we conjecture indeed that such black hole is much likely to be an unstable solution of the ads / bcft holographic model .",
    "our analysis points to the fact that , from a charged black hole with tensionless rs brane , it can not emerge a complete picture of a quantum hall system . to find a more realistic ads / bcft description of the qhe one needs to construct solutions with non - vanishing tension of the rs brane .",
    "such solutions should enable us to describe the configurations shown in figure  [ fig : gap](d ) .",
    "we expect that the new solutions should have the following properties : namely , we expect that the dual system exhibits a gap in the  bulk \" , an edge current running along its perimeter and that the tension of the rs branes should be somewhat related to the fermi energy of the dual system . as a result",
    "the conductivities will be modified ; in particular , the transverse electric conductivity in the  bulk \" and near the edges may differ , the ratio of the transverse heat and electric conductivities may satisfy a wiedemann - franz law  ( [ wflaw2 ] ) modified by the interaction of the charge carriers .",
