    "we recall , first of all , that the motion of the cursor does not depend on the operators acting on the register.@xcite for the particular case of a _ sequential program line _ as the one described by the hamilonian ( [ e : firsth ] ) , this is made evident by the explicit expression@xcite of the amplitudes @xmath35 in ( [ e : evolution ] ) : they are given , independently of the operators @xmath16 , by :    @xmath36    where :    @xmath37    similar results hold in the case , studied in ref.@xcite , in which , because of _ conditional jumps _ in the program line ( such as the ones needed in the iteration of _ quantum subroutines _ ) , the cursor performs , in effect , a continuous - time quantum walk@xcite on a planar graph . in this note",
