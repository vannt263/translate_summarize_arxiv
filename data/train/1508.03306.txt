    "one of the fundamental questions in the phenomenology of quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) is what the properties of matter are at the extreme densities and temperatures where quarks and gluons are in a new state of matter , the so - called quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "collisions of high - energy heavy - ions , at the brookhaven relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , allow us to create and study the properties of such a system in the laboratory .",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy in particle production is , at these energies , an observable which provides experimental information on the equation of state and the transport properties of the qgp .",
    "this anisotropy is usually characterized by the fourier flow - coefficients  @xcite , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the azimuthal angle of the particles , @xmath5 is the @xmath6-order flow plane ( or named final state symmetry plane ) angle and @xmath7 denotes an average over the selected particles and events .    in the last decade , the elliptic flow @xmath8  @xcite , which is considered to correspond to the elliptical shape of the spatial overlap region in the system created in the collisions  @xcite , has received a lot of experimental and theoretical attention .",
    "for a recent summary see  @xcite .",
    "more recently , higher odd and even anisotropic flow coefficients are found to be also very important  @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic calculations predict that these higher harmonics , such as the triangular flow @xmath9 , are more sensitive to the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath10 of the qgp than @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is realized that the correlations between the symmetry planes and flow harmonics are sensitive to both the initial state and @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the combined analysis of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 distributions for a single harmonic , and the correlations between different orders of symmetry planes ( direction of the flow vector ) and flow harmonics ( magnitude of the flow vector ) could yield powerful constraints on both initial conditions and properties of the qgp .",
    "however , so far the investigation of the above mentioned combined analysis using a transport model was still lacking .    in this paper , we present the calculations of initial state anisotropies and final state anisotropic flow in au+au collisions at @xmath11  gev using the ampt model  @xcite .",
    "we also investigate the relation between the magnitude , fluctuations and correlations of the initial state spatial eccentricity and final state anisotropic flow coefficients .",
    "in addition , the correlations between different order symmetry planes and harmonics will be investigated in both initial and final state , which will help us understand how they are modified during the expansion of the system .",
    "a multi - phase transport ( ampt ) model  @xcite with a so - called string melting scenario has been used for these studies .",
    "the model consists of four main stages : initial conditions , partonic interactions , hadronization and finally hadronic rescattering .",
    "the initial conditions , which include the spatial and momentum distributions of minijet partons and soft string excitations , are obtained from the hijing model  @xcite .",
    "the strings are converted into partons and the next stage , which models the interactions between all the partons , is based on zpc  @xcite .",
    "the partonic cascade model zpc presently includes only 2-body processes with cross sections obtained from pqcd with screening masses . in zpc ,",
    "the default value of the cross section is 3 mb .",
    "the transition from partonic- to hadronic - matter is modeled by a simple coalescence model , which combines two quarks into mesons and three quarks into baryons  @xcite . finally , to describe the dynamics of the subsequent hadronic stage , a hadronic cascade based on the art model  @xcite is used . in this analysis , we used the default input parameters of ampt with string melting suggested in  @xcite .",
    "the results are presented as a function of centrality , which determined by impact parameter @xmath12 , as used in  @xcite .",
    "the possible effects of the fluctuations of impact parameters will be discussed in next section .",

    "in contrast , the ( @xmath149 , @xmath150 ) correlation is negative and decreases with increasing centrality , plotted in fig .",
    "4 ( bottom ) . the negative initial ( @xmath149 , @xmath150 ) correlation and positive final ( @xmath135 , @xmath109 ) correlation observed in the ampt model are in qualitative agreement with viscous hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite .",
    "there is a clear sign change of the @xmath151-order and @xmath152-order plane correlation during the collision system evolution , both in the transport model and in the hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath153-order and @xmath154-order plane correlation , has a negative value in the initial ( @xmath155 , @xmath156 ) correlations while it is consistent with 0 within uncertainty in the final state ( @xmath136 , @xmath111 ) correlations .",
    "in addition , we can see in fig .",
    "4 ( top ) that there is no clear difference of the qc@xmath157 from all charged particles ( solid symbols ) and the like - sign ( ls ) particles ( open symbols ) , which indicates that non - flow contributions to the above observables are small and the sign change of the plane correlations can not be explained by the possible non - flow contributions .    considering that the initial anisotropy @xmath0 and the final anisotropic flow @xmath1 are both positive , the above results can only be explained if the sign of the genuine correlation , the cosine component , changes during the evolution of the produced system .",
    "in fact , hydrodynamic calculations suggest that the final @xmath158-order flow plane @xmath5 might be not only driven by @xmath143 , but might also have contributions from other symmetry plane(s ) .",
    "the @xmath159-order harmonic @xmath160 and its associated flow plane @xmath135 are determined by a linear and a quadratic response  @xcite , @xmath161 where @xmath162 describes the linear response , and @xmath163 quantifies the non - linear response .",
    "this nonlinear response in hydrodynamic calculations couples @xmath160 to @xmath164 and also couples @xmath165 to @xmath166  @xcite , and clearly both @xmath150 and @xmath149 contribute to @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , these results show that the initial symmetry plane @xmath143 and the flow plane @xmath5 do not coincident in the ampt model .",
    "similar results were also observed in the previous transport model calculations using urqmd model  @xcite , and confirmed by hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite .",
    "thus , the assumption @xmath167 used in the so - called true flow calculations ( or symmetry plane flow ) , @xmath168  @xcite is not valid .",
    "in addition , we notice that a new method , named scalar product method  @xcite , is proposed to measure the flow plane correlations without contributions of anisotropic flow .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that this method is based on the assumption that @xmath169 .",
    "in fact , the recent ` standard candle ' calculations @xmath170  @xcite have shown that there are strong ( anti-)correlations between event - by - event fluctuations of @xmath1 and @xmath171 , therefore the equality @xmath169 assumed in the scalar product method does not hold .",
    "thus , in this paper , we discuss the symmetry plane correlations using only the mixed harmonic correlations .",
    "- and @xmath172-order harmonics in the final state ( top ) and initial state ( bottom ) in au+au collisions at 200 gev by ampt stringmelting . , scaledwidth=47.0% ]    not only the correlations between symmetry planes but also the correlations between different flow harmonics can be investigated via the multi - particle correlation technique .",
    "the observable @xmath170 was proposed as an unique tool to probe the correlations between different orders of flow harmonics and by design independent of the symmetry planes  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] ( top ) we see a clear non - zero value for both @xmath173 ( red markers ) and @xmath174 ( blue markers ) in the final state .",
    "the positive results of @xmath173 and negative results of @xmath174 are observed for the presented centrality classes . these ( anti-)correlations are more pronounced in peripheral collisions .",
    "it indicates that finding @xmath8 larger than @xmath65 in an event enhances the probability of finding @xmath160 larger than @xmath175 and , in addition , the probability of finding @xmath9 smaller than @xmath176 in that event , as was shown in a previous study  @xcite .",
    "also we investigate the correlations of the @xmath158- and @xmath172-order harmonics in the initial state , calculating : @xmath177 the result is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] ( bottom ) .",
    "we see a positive and increasing trend for @xmath178 while a negative and decreasing trend of @xmath179 is observed .",
    "they capture the rough trend of @xmath173 and @xmath174 in the final state but can not quantitatively describe the centrality dependence .",
    "this suggests indeed a correlation between the initial state @xmath180 and final state @xmath170 , but this might not be the only contribution to the final state .",
    "in addition the system evolution , might also modify the strength of @xmath170 . in a previous study  @xcite ,",
    "three configurations of the ampt model , named : ( a ) 3 mb ; ( b ) 10 mb ; and ( c ) 10 mb no rescattering , have been investigated to better understand the @xmath170 calculations . in general",
    ", the configuration of ( a ) 3 mb generates weaker partonic interactions during the system evolution compared to ( b ) 10 mb . and",
    "the hadronic interactions are turned off for ( c ) 10 mb no rescattering .",
    "the comparisons between these three configurations shows that the value of @xmath170 depends on both the partonic and the hadronic interactions .",
    "these results suggest that the sign of @xmath170 is determined by the initial state @xmath180 and the magnitude is modified by the multiple interactions during the system evolution .",
    "as we discussed above , the elliptic - power function gives a better description of the @xmath49 of each single harmonic .",
    "however , it is an open question at the moment how the joint underlying @xmath49 including different order symmetry planes and harmonics is described and , additionally , if these correlations between different order symmetry planes and harmonics modify the single harmonics @xmath49 the investigations presented here begins to answer these open questions . nevertheless , many more measurements between different order symmetry planes and harmonics are necessary to reasonably constrain a joint @xmath49 , and ultimately lead to new insights into the nature of the fluctuation of the created matter in heavy ion collisions .",
    "in this paper we presented the calculations of the initial and final state anisotropies in au+au collisions at @xmath181 gev using ampt simulations .",
    "it is found that the elliptic - power function is the only @xmath49 so far which describes the event - by - event distributions of the eccentricity as well as the triangularity , the anisotropic flow from multi - particle cumulants and the relative flow fluctuations very well .",
    "in addition , the correlations between different order symmetry planes and harmonics have been investigated .",
    "a different centrality dependence of these correlations in the initial and final state has been observed within the same framework of a transport model .",
    "this result indicates that both the fluctuations in the initial geometry and the dynamical evolution of the medium in the final state plays an important roles .",
    "it is currently still unclear how well the underlying joint @xmath49 matches the experimental data as these predictions still have to be tested at rhic and at the lhc . the study presented in this paper should help us better understand the fluctuations of created matter in heavy ion experiments .",
