    "the maximum at about 3.3 k changes and disappears when the applied magnetic field exceeds 5 t. ]        figure 6 shows susceptibility measurements @xmath60 , at magnetic fields from 0.01 t to 5 t. those results indicated than at a field of 3.5 t , the peak at @xmath61 = 3.3 k disappears .",
    "this change in the magnetic behavior is related with a metamagnetic transition .",
    "thus , the applied field @xmath0 3.5 t , in this compound , is the critical field at which the constraints of crystal field are exceeded , and the magnetic behavior changes .",
    "these results can be compared with those found in other @xmath16 systems .",
    "evidences of a metamagnetic transition in @xmath6 was also obtained in polycrystalline materials @xcite .",
    "the transition has been anticipated by slope changes in @xmath33 with higher applied fields , i.e. , @xmath62 30 kg and below @xmath63 k. in this compound , the one - dimensional magnetic character can be enhanced by replacing the transaxial aquo group by organic groups , such as bipyridine .",
    "this has the effect of reducing the interchains interaction and consequently the nel temperature , and the critical fields required for the metamagnetic transitions @xcite .",
    "important examples about these behavior are @xmath64 , and @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the details of the magnetic properties of these materials are best understood by examining single crystal data because the transitions are sensitive to the orientation of the applied field @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that in figure 5 , we show that the magnetic susceptibility presents a wide maximum at about 43 k. from 100 k to room temperature @xmath60 smoothly decreases , and a paramagnetic curie - weiss behavior can be fitted .",
    "the maximum value at 43 k changes with the magnetic field applied as shown in this figure .",
    "the changes are on the range from 0.91x@xmath66 to 1.03x@xmath66 @xmath67 .",
    "this behavior is quite similar to the reported in other compounds , as @xmath68 , where pip= piperazine , which is formed by chains of @xmath69_{n}$ ] and @xmath70_{n}$ ] . in that example , a broad maximum is observed and occurs at 53(1 ) k @xcite .",
    "so , accordingly the broad maximum in the susceptibility in our compound is a typical behavior of a low dimensional antiferromagnetic system @xcite .    in figure 7",
    "we show a plot of the inverse of susceptibility , @xmath71 at @xmath72 = 0.01 , 0.50 and 5.00 t , for @xmath73 .",
    "the analysis of these measurements was performed by fitting a curie - weiss from room temperature to 100 k. the fit parameters were weiss temperature @xmath74 and curie constant @xmath75 varying from -76.90 to -99.82 k and from 1.35 to 1.67 @xmath76mol@xmath77k , respectively .    the fit parameters could be used to calculate the effective magnetic moment @xmath78 per mole from equation @xmath79= 2.84@xmath80^{1/2}$]= 2.84 @xmath81^{1/2}$ ] , which is shown in figure 8 .     for dihydrate nickel oxalate .",
    "the weiss temperature @xmath82 , changes from about -76.90 to -99.82 k. the curie constant also changes from 1.35 to 1.67 @xmath76mol@xmath83k , from high to low magnetic fields . ]    per mol as a function of temperature . at room temperature",
    "the values change from 3.30 to about 3.67 @xmath84 , depending on the magnetic field applied .",
    "@xmath85 is the number of unpaired electrons . ]",
    "an important aspect of the behavior @xmath79 , for this compound , and related to curie constant , and the large negative weiss constant , is indicative of a significant antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between neighbouring nickel ions , and a big degree of frustration @xcite .",
    "it is quite possible because the metamagnetic transition obtained in figures 5 and 6 .",
    "as observed , this dramatic change of the @xmath79 is the effect of the change of the curie constant , and then via the number of unpaired electrons .",
    "thus , accordingly to @xmath79= @xmath86^{1/2}$ ] , the number of unpaired electrons @xmath87 in @xmath57 can be calculated as 1.40 , 1.23 and 1.22 respectively for applied field of 0.01 t , 0.50 t and 5.0 t.    in order to understand more about the magnetic characteristics of this oxalate , we studied the @xmath20 isothermal measurements from the temperature range 2 - 80 k ( see figure 9 ) , from these data we extracted the coercive field , which shows a small measurable and perceptible exchange bias .",
    "our measurements of the coercive field , although small , were carefully checked and are below of the possible errors .",
    "the results are displayed in figure 10 .     from 2 to 15 k shown in the main panel .",
    "note the coercive field and the small exchange bias .",
    "inset shows the @xmath33 measurements at 4 t and different temperatures from 2 to 80 k. at low fields ( main panel ) the hysteric effect is clearly observed .",
    "the asymmetric behavior in the coercive field is related to a exchange bias effect due to canted spins , but other type of interaction is not discarted as driven by dzyalochinsky - moriya type exchange ( dm ) . ]",
    "this exchange bias can be explained as the effect of inter and intra chains interactions in this compound .",
    "the interaction of metallic ions between chains is at the origin of spin canting .",
    "this small but measurable exchange bias indicates that instead of produce a pure antiferromagnetic order , the magnetic order has been distorted by canted spins giving rise to weak ferromagnetism . since weak ferromagnets are a delicate balance of opposing forces , it is not surprising to find that many are also metamagnets @xcite .",
    "experimentally , it is important to mention that great care was taken when measuring the exchange bias .",
    "our squid magnetometer is provided with a mu metal shielding . at the moment of performing the magnetization measurements a flux gate magnetometer",
    "was used to demagnetize the superconducting coil .",
    "this procedure reduces the magnetic field to a very small value to about 0.001 g or less and the mu shielding eliminates external magnetic influences , as the earth magnetic field .",
    "microcrystals single phase of orthorhombic nickel ( ii ) oxalate dihydrate were prepared by soft solution chemistry , as observed by xrd powder diffraction . chemical analysis , dta and tg",
    "studies revealed that the microcrystals are of high purity .",
    "@xmath60 measurements showed the existence of two maxima at 3.3 k and at 43 k. the first one at low temperature changes and disappears with applied magnetic field , this change is due to metamagnetic transition , the maximum disappears with applied field about @xmath88 3.5 t. the second maximum indicates an antiferromagnetic order , with interactions due to coupled chains via inter- and intrachain interactions and/or dm type - exchange .",
    "the effects of interchain interactions disturb the af coupling , distorting it and canting spins , which in turn produces a weak ferromagnetic order .",
    "this wf is evident by hysteresis measurements in m - h isothermal measurements .",
