    "astrophysical disks are common because the specific angular momentum of the matter inside them is well - conserved .",
    "they evolve because angular momentum conservation is weakly compromised , either because of diffusion of angular momentum within the disk or because of direct application of external torques .    in astrophysical disks composed of a well - ionized plasma",
    "it is likely that some , perhaps most , of the evolution is driven by diffusion of angular momentum within the disk .",
    "this view is certainly consistent with observations of steadily accreting cataclysmic variable systems like ux ursa majoris @xcite , whose radial surface - brightness profile is consistent with steady accretion - flow models in which the bulk of the accretion energy is dissipated within the disk .",
    "angular momentum diffusion in well - ionized disks is likely driven by magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence .",
    "analytic analyses , numerical experiments , and laboratory evidence strongly suggest that well - coupled plasmas in differentially - rotating flows are subject to the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; @xcite ) . but",
    "mhd turbulence is initiated by the mri only so long as the plasma is sufficiently ionized to couple to the magnetic field @xcite . in disks around young stars , cataclysmic - variable and x - ray binary disks in quiescence , and possibly the outer parts of agn disks",
    ", the plasma may be too neutral to support magnetic activity @xcite .",
    "this motivates interest in non - mhd angular momentum transport mechanisms .    within the last few years",
    ", a body of work has been developed suggesting that vortices can be generated as a result of global hydrodynamic instability @xcite or local hydrodynamic instability @xcite , that vortices in disks may be long - lived @xcite , and that these vortices may be related to an outward flux of angular momentum @xcite . if these claims can be verified then the consequences for low - ionization disks would be profound .    here",
    "we investigate the evolution of a disk that is given a large initial vortical velocity perturbation .",
    "our study is done in the context of a ( two - dimensional ) shearing - sheet model , which permits us to resolve the dynamics to a degree that is not currently possible in a global disk model .",
    "our model is also fully compressible , unlike previous work using a local model @xcite .",
    "the former assume incompressible flow and the latter use the anelastic approximation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which filters out the high - frequency acoustic waves .",
    "we will show that compressibility and acoustic waves play an essential part in the angular momentum transport .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the model . in ",
    "3 we describe the evolution of a fiducial , high - resolution model . in ",
    "4 we investigate the dependence of the results on model parameters . and",
    "in  5 we describe implications , with an emphasis on key open questions : are the vortices destroyed by three - dimensional instabilities ? ; and do mechanisms exist that can inject vorticity into the disk ?",
    "the shearing - sheet model is obtained via a rigorous expansion of the two - dimensional hydrodynamic equations of motion to lowest order in @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the disk scale height ( @xmath4 is the isothermal sound speed and @xmath5 is the local rotation frequency ) and @xmath6 is the local radius . see @xcite for a description . adopting a local cartesian coordinate system where the @xmath7 axis is oriented parallel to the radius vector and the @xmath8 axis points forward in azimuth , the equations of motion become @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the two - dimensional density and pressure",
    ", @xmath13 is the fluid velocity and @xmath14 is the lagrangian derivative .",
    "the third and fourth terms in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) represent the coriolis and centrifugal forces in the local model expansion , where @xmath15 is the shear parameter .",
    "we will assume throughout that @xmath16 , corresponding to a keplerian shear profile .",
    "we close the above equations with an isothermal equation of state @xmath17 where @xmath4 is constant in time and space .    equations ( [ eq1 ] ) through ( [ eq3 ] ) can be combined to show that the vertical component of potential vorticity @xmath18 is a constant of the motion ; i.e. , the potential vorticity of fluid elements in two dimensions is conserved .",
    "an equilibrium solution to the equations of motion is @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 thus the differential rotation of the disk makes an appearance in the form of a linear shear .",
    "we integrate the above equations using a version of the zeus code @xcite .",
    "zeus is a time - explicit , operator - split scheme on a staggered mesh .",
    "it uses artificial viscosity to capture shocks .",
    "our computational domain is a rectangle of size @xmath23 containing @xmath24 grid cells .",
    "the numerical resolution is therefore @xmath25 .",
    "our code differs from the standard zeus algorithm in two respects .",
    "first , we have implemented a version of the shearing - box boundary conditions .",
    "the model is then periodic in the @xmath8 direction ; the @xmath7 boundaries are initial joined in a periodic fashion , but they are allowed to shear with respect to each other , becoming periodic again when @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "a detailed description of the boundary conditions is given in @xcite .",
    "second , we treat advection by the mean flow @xmath28 separately from advection by the perturbed flow @xmath29 .",
    "mean - flow advection can be done by interpolation , using the algorithm described in @xcite , which is similar to the fargo scheme @xcite .",
    "this has the advantage that the timestep is not limited by the mean flow velocity ( it is @xmath30 rather than @xmath31 that enters the courant condition ) .",
    "this permits the use of a timestep that is larger than the usual timestep by @xmath32 if @xmath33 .",
    "the shear - interpolation scheme also makes the algorithm more nearly translation - invariant in the @xmath34 plane , thereby more nearly embodying an important symmetry of the underlying equations .      without a specific model for the process that is injecting the vorticity , it is difficult to settle on a particular set of initial conditions , or to know how these initial conditions ought to vary when the size of the box is allowed to vary .",
    "our choice of initial conditions is therefore somewhat arbitrary .",
    "we use a set of initial ( incompressive ) velocity perturbations drawn from a gaussian random field .",
    "the amplitude of the perturbations is characterized by @xmath35 .",
    "the power spectrum is @xmath36 , corresponding to the energy spectrum ( @xmath37 ) of a two - dimensional kolmogorov inverse turbulent cascade , with cutoffs at @xmath38 and @xmath39 , corresponding to vorticity injection either at scales @xmath40 or scales @xmath41 .",
    "the results are qualitatively the same . ] .",
    "the surface density is not perturbed .",
    "these initial conditions correspond to a set of purely vortical perturbations .",
    "the parameters for our fiducial run are @xmath42 and @xmath43 .      although our basic algorithm has already been tested ( see @xcite ) , we test the current version of our code by making a comparison with linear theory . due to the underlying shear , small - amplitude perturbations in the shearing sheet",
    "are naturally decomposed in terms of shearing waves or _ shwaves _ ( see @xcite and references therein ) , fourier components in the `` co - shearing '' frame .",
    "these have time - dependent wavenumber @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are constant .",
    "the evolution of a single fourier component can be calculated by integrating an ordinary differential equation for the amplitude of the shwave . for purely vortical ( nonzero _ potential _ vorticity ) or non - vortical perturbations , the evolution can be obtained analytically .",
    "the explicit expression for the amplitude of a vortical ( incompressive ) shwave is @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and a subscript @xmath51 on a quantity indicates its value at @xmath52 . ) . ]",
    "the amplitude of a non - vortical ( compressive ) shwave satisfies the differential equation @xmath53 the solutions of which are parabolic cylinder functions .",
    "see @xcite for further details on the shwave solutions .",
    "figure  [ pap3f1 ] compares the numerical evolution of both vortical and compressive shwave amplitudes with their analytic solutions .",
    "the initial shwave vector ( @xmath54 ) is ( @xmath55 ) for the vortical shwave and ( @xmath56 ) for the compressive shwave .",
    "the other model parameters are the same as those in the fiducial run , except that @xmath57 for the vortical - shwave evolution since @xmath58 is required to prevent mixing between vortical and non - vortical shwaves near @xmath59 .",
    "the shwaves are well resolved until the radial wavelength @xmath60 , and the code is capable of tracking both potential - vorticity and compressive perturbations with high accuracy .",
    "the evolution of the potential vorticity in our fiducial run is shown in figure  [ pap3f2 ] .",
    "the snapshots are shown in lexicographic order beginning with the initial conditions , which have equal positive and negative @xmath61 .",
    "one of the most remarkable features of the fiducial run evolution is the appearance of comparatively - stable , long - lived vortices .",
    "these vortices have negative @xmath61 and are therefore dark in figure  [ pap3f2 ] .",
    "similar vortices have been seen by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "cross sections of one of the vortices at the end of the run are shown in figure  [ pap3f3 ] . in our models the vortices",
    "are not associated with easily identifiable features in the surface density , since the perturbed vorticity is not large enough to require , through the equilibrium condition , an order unity increase in the local pressure .    while the vortices are long - lived , they do decay .",
    "figure  [ pap3f4 ] shows the evolution of the perturbed ( noncircular ) kinetic energy @xmath62 in the fiducial run .",
    "evidently the kinetic energy decays approximately as @xmath1 ( which is remarkable in that , if the vortices would correspond to features in _ luminosity _ that decay as @xmath1 , they could produce flicker noise ; see @xcite )",
    ". runs with half and twice the resolution decay in the same fashion , but if the resolution is reduced to @xmath63 the kinetic energy decays exponentially . resolution of at least 128 zones per scale height appears to be required .",
    "what is even more remarkable is that the vortices are associated with an outward angular momentum flux , due to the driving of compressive motions by the vortices .",
    "figure  [ pap3f5 ] shows the evolution of the dimensionless angular momentum flux @xmath64 for models with a variety of resolutions .",
    "the data has been boxcar smoothed over an interval @xmath65 to make the plot readable .",
    "again , a resolution of at least @xmath66 appears to be required for a converged measurement of the shear stress . for the most highly resolved models @xmath67 evolves like the kinetic energy , @xmath68 .",
    "compressibility is crucial for development of the angular momentum flux .",
    "we have demonstrated this in two ways .",
    "first , we have taken the fiducial run and decomposed the velocity field into a compressive and an incompressive part ( i.e. , into potential and solenoidal pieces in fourier space ) and measured the stress associated with each .",
    "for a set of snapshots taken from the last half of the fiducial run , the average total @xmath69 ; the incompressive component is @xmath70 ; the compressive component is @xmath71 .",
    "the remaining alpha @xmath72 is in cross - correlations between the incompressive and compressive pieces of the velocity field . as argued in @xcite and @xcite , both incompressive trailing shwaves and incompressible turbulence transport angular momentum inward , whereas trailing compressive disturbances transport angular momentum outward .",
    "our negative ( positive ) value for @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) is consistent with this .",
    "second , we have reduced the size of the model and reduced the amplitude of the initial perturbation so that it scales with the shear velocity at the edge of the model ( constant `` intensity '' of the turbulence , in umurhan and regev s parlance ) .",
    "thus the mach number of the turbulence is reduced in proportion to the size of the box .",
    "we have compared four models , with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we would expect the lower mach number models to have smaller - amplitude compressive velocity fields and therefore , consistent with the above results , smaller angular momentum flux @xmath67 .",
    "averaging over the second half of the simulation , we find @xmath77 .",
    "an additional confirmation of our overall picture can be seen in figure  [ pap3f6 ] , in which we show a snapshot of the velocity divergence superimposed on the potential vorticity for a medium - resolution ( @xmath78 ) version of the fiducial run .",
    "the position of the shocks with respect to the vortices in this figure is consistent with our interpretation that the former are generated by the latter .",
    "the smallest of our simulations ( @xmath57 ) is nearly incompressible , but we continue to observe @xmath1 decay ( least squares fit power law is @xmath79 ) at late times .",
    "the reason that we see decay while @xcite do not may be that : ( 1 ) the remaining compressibility in our model causes added dissipation ; ( 2 ) the numerical dissipation in our code is larger than that of @xcite ; ( 3 ) the code used by @xcite could somehow be aliasing power from trailing shwaves to leading shwaves ( although they do explicitly discuss , and dismiss , this possibility ) .    to highlight the dangers of aliasing for our finite - difference code , in figure  [ pap3f7 ] we show the evolution of a vortical shwave amplitude at low resolution ( @xmath63 ) , in units of @xmath80 .",
    "we use the same parameters as those in our linear - theory test ( figure  [ pap3f1 ] ) , for which the initial shwave vector corresponds to @xmath81 . the initially - leading shwave swings into a trailing shwave , the radial wavelength is eventually lost near the grid scale , and due to aliasing the code picks up the evolution of the shwave again as a leading shwave . repeating this test at higher resolutions indicates that successive swings from leading to trailing occur at an interval of @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the azimuthal wavenumber of the shwave .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath84 .",
    "the decay of the successive linear solutions with time is due to numerical diffusion .",
    "figure  [ pap3f7 ] suggests that it is easier to inject power into the simulation due to aliasing rather than to remove power due to numerical diffusion .",
    "we do not believe , however , that aliasing is affecting our high - resolution results .",
    "in addition , if we assume that the flow in our simulations can be modeled as two - dimensional kolmogorov turbulence , then @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the rms velocity variation across a scale @xmath87 .",
    "the velocity due to the mean shear at these scales is @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "the velocities at the smallest scales are thus dominated by turbulence rather than by the mean shear .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the convergence of our numerical results at high resolution .",
    "our model contains two additional numerical parameters : the size @xmath90 and the initial turbulence amplitude @xmath91 .",
    "figure  [ pap3f8 ] shows the evolution of @xmath67 for several values of @xmath91 .",
    "evidently for small enough values of @xmath91 the @xmath67 amplitude is reduced , but for near - sonic initial mach numbers the @xmath67 amplitude saturates ( or at least the dependence on @xmath91 is greatly weakened ) .",
    "figure  [ pap3f9 ] shows the evolution for several values of @xmath90 but the same initial @xmath91 and the identical initial power spectrum . for large enough @xmath90",
    "the shear stress appears to be independent of @xmath90 .",
    "finally , we have studied the autocorrelation function of the potential vorticity as a means of characterizing structure inside the flow .",
    "figure  [ pap3f10 ] shows the autocorrelation function measured in the fiducial model and in an otherwise identical model with @xmath92 . evidently the potential vorticity is correlated over about one - half a scale height in radius , independent of the size of the model .",
    "this supports the idea that compressive effects limit the size of the vortices , since the shear flow becomes supersonic across a vortex of size @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the presence of long - lived vortices in weakly - ionized disks may be an integral part of the angular momentum transport mechanism in these systems .",
    "the key result we have shown here is that compressibility of the flow is an extremely important factor in providing a significant , positively - correlated average shear stress with its associated outward transport of angular momentum .",
    "previous results using a local model have assumed incompressible flow and either report no angular momentum transport @xcite or report a value ( @xmath93 , @xcite ) that is two orders of magnitude lower than what we find when we include the effects of compressibility .",
    "global simulations @xcite have a difficult time accessing the high resolution that we have shown is required for a significant shear stress due to compressibility .",
    "our work leaves open the key question of what happens in three dimensions .",
    "our vortices , which have radial and azimuthal extent @xmath94 , are inherently three - dimensional .",
    "three - dimensional vortices are susceptible to the elliptical instability @xcite and are likely to be destroyed on a dynamical timescale .",
    "the fact that vortices persist in our two - dimensional simulations and not in the local ( three - dimensional ) shearing - box calculations of @xcite is likely due to dimensionality .",
    "the recent numerical results of @xcite indicate that vortices near the disk midplane are quickly destroyed , whereas vortices survive if they are a couple of scale heights away from the midplane .",
    "strong vertical stratification away from the midplane may enforce two - dimensional flow and allow the vortices that we consider here to survive .",
    "the initial conditions in @xcite are analytic solutions for two - dimensional vortices that are stacked into a three - dimensional column .",
    "the stable , off - midplane vortices apparently arise due to the breaking of internal gravity waves generated by the midplane vortices before they become unstable .",
    "there is also an unidentified instability that breaks a single off - midplane vortex into several vortices .",
    "these simulations leave open the question of whether stable off - midplane vortices can be generated from a random set of initial vorticity perturbations rather than the special vortex solutions that are imposed .",
    "our work also leaves open the key question of what generates the initial vorticity .",
    "one possibility is that material builds up at particular radii in the disk , resulting in a global instability ( e.g. @xcite ) and a breakdown of the flow into vortices @xcite .",
    "a second possibility for vortex generation in variable systems is that the mhd turbulence , which likely operates during an outburst but decays as the disk cools @xcite , leaves behind some residual vorticity .",
    "the viability of such a mechanism could be tested with non - ideal mhd simulations such as those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a third possibility is that differential illumination of the disk somehow produces vorticity .",
    "since the temperature of most circumstellar disks is controlled by stellar illumination , small variations in illumination could produce hot and cold spots in the disk that interact to produce vortices .",
    "a fourth possibility is the generation of vorticity via baroclinic instability , which is likely to operate in disks whose vertical stratification is close to adiabatic @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear outcome of this instability in planetary atmospheres is the formation of vortices , although it is far from clear that the same outcome will occur in disks .",
    "finally , we note that a residual amount of vorticity can be generated from finite - amplitude compressive perturbations",
    ". we have performed a series of runs with zero initial vorticity and perturbation wavelengths on the order of the scale height , and the results are qualitatively similar to figure  [ pap3f5 ] with the shear stress reduced by nearly two orders of magnitude ."
