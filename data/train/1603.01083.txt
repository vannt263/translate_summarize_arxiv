    "<S> intrinsically explosive growth of a ballooning finger is demonstrated in nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic calculations of high-@xmath0 disruptions in tokamaks . </S>",
    "<S> the explosive finger is formed by an ideally unstable @xmath1 mode , dominated by an @xmath2 component . </S>",
    "<S> the quadrupole geometry of the @xmath3 perturbed pressure field provides a generic mechanism for the formation of the initial ballooning finger and its subsequent transition from exponential to explosive growth , without relying on secondary processes . </S>",
    "<S> the explosive ejection of the hot plasma from the core and stochastization of the magnetic field occur in alfvnic time scales , accounting for the extremely fast growth of the precursor oscillations and the rapidity of the thermal quench in some high-@xmath0 disruptions .    </S>",
    "<S> tokamak plasmas operate within imperfectly - defined operational boundaries . accidental or deliberate </S>",
    "<S> crossing of these boundaries generally leads to a sudden loss of confinement : the thermal energy content of the plasma is lost on sub - millisecond time scales ( thermal quench ) , followed by a somewhat slower ( ms time scale ) loss of poloidal magnetic energy ( current quench ) ( see , for example , wesson@xcite , sect . </S>",
    "<S> 7.7 , for a basic discussion , and hender@xcite for more recent developments ) . </S>",
    "<S> the energy lost from the plasma invariably ends up on plasma facing components such as the first wall or divertor tiles . </S>",
    "<S> this sudden energy flux , and the forces generated on the surrounding structures by currents that directly couple to them or are inductively induced during the current quench , pose a significant threat to the structural integrity of the device@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , understanding disruptions , and their prevention or mitigation continue to be very active research areas in magnetic fusion </S>",
    "<S> .    causes of disruptions in tokamaks are generally divided into four major categories . </S>",
    "<S> ( i )  density - limit disruptions are caused by plasma density that exceeds a mostlyexperimentally - defined `` greenwald limit , '' @xmath4@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii )  current - limit disruptions are caused by a macroscopic magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) instability when the plasma current @xmath5 is too high and results in an edge safety factor that is too low , @xmath6@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath7 ( in cylindrical geometry ) where @xmath8 are the poloidal and toroidal field strengths , respectively , and @xmath9 are the minor and major radii of the torus . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii )  @xmath0-limit disruptions result when the plasma pressure is too high , typically represented as a limit on the normalized ( dimensional ) quantity @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the ratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure , and @xmath12 represents a volume average . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv )  in the last category are vertical displacement events ( vde s ) that result from a loss of positional control that brings the plasma in contact with the material structures around it ( see , for example , granetz@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> all disruptive events tend to be accompanied by an eventual loss of vertical control ; thus , a vde may be the cause or result of a disruption due to other reasons .    </S>",
    "<S> fusion power density @xmath13 depends quadratically on the electron density @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> since the magnetic field strength is generally limited by engineering concerns , high fusion power requires high @xmath0 values ( @xmath15 ) , thus making @xmath0-limit disruptions particularly important for present - day tokamaks and the next step device iter .    </S>",
    "<S> some disruptions at high-@xmath0 tend to have very fast - growing precursors or no discernible precursors at all@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when they are present , the precursor oscillations , for example on the edge magnetic field signals , precede the thermal quench typically by less than a millisecond ; time evolution of the signals suggests a mode growing at least exponentially and possibly explosively ( faster than exponentially ) well into the nonlinear regime .    </S>",
    "<S> hastie , in the context of sawtooth oscillations@xcite , and callen , for high-@xmath0 disruptions@xcite , showed that an ideal mhd mode going through its marginal point as the plasma @xmath0 increases linearly due to external heating may grow as @xmath16 , thus providing a plausible explanation for the short time - scale of the precursors . in both works , </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic time @xmath17 is a geometric mean of the mhd ( @xmath18 ) and heating ( @xmath19 ) time scales . under these conditions , faster than exponential growth of an ideal @xmath1 mode was confirmed in numerical simulations of a particular diii - d disruption ( see , for example , @xcite ) using the nimrod code@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this simulation seems to have used only the @xmath20 modes in the toroidal fourier expansions ; thus , it is only a `` quasi - linear , '' not a proper nonlinear calculation , which would require the presence of higher harmonics of the @xmath1 mode . in addition , this particular path to explosive growth was shown to be implausible , requiring an unrealistically small initial perturbation amplitude to generate alfvnic growth , due to the vast separation in time scales @xmath18 and @xmath19@xcite </S>",
    "<S> .    some characteristics of the actual mhd modes possibly involved in high-@xmath0 disruptions were studied by park@xcite and kleva@xcite . in the former a high pressure front produced by a non - resonant @xmath21 mode ( the quasi - interchange mode@xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> was shown to be unstable to high-@xmath22 ballooning modes , which nonlinearly lead to a disruption . </S>",
    "<S> kleva s work relied on resistive ballooning modes or their collisionless analogue and was challenged@xcite as being not relevant much below the ideal ballooning stability limit ( see also @xcite ) .    in this letter , we show computationally that the ideal @xmath2 mode , because of its unique geometric characteristics , may provide a generic mechanism for an explosive instability directly and thus may be responsible for those high-@xmath0 disruptions with very fast precursors . </S>",

    "<S> noncircular geometries are treated through a conformal transformation from the poloidal coordinates @xmath23 to the unit circle in conformal coordinates @xmath24 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . a resistive wall@xcite and diverted plasmas@xcite can also be treated , but for computational efficiency the results discussed here will be in circular geometry with an ideal wall . </S>",
    "<S> however , the coordinate axis will be shifted to the magnetic axis with a conformal transformation to approximately align the @xmath25 surfaces with flux surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> more general results will be presented elsewhere .    experimental context for these calculations </S>",
    "<S> is , ironically , not disruptions but highly stable discharges that last many tens of seconds while exhibiting a long - lived @xmath3 mode in the kstar tokamak@xcite , under conditions similar to `` advanced / hybrid scenarios''@xcite , with high edge safety factor @xmath26 and a low inductive current fraction . during investigations into the nature of this mode </S>",
    "<S> , it was discovered that in equilibria with peaked pressure profiles , either a benign @xmath3 mode that saturates at a small amplitude , or an explosively growing @xmath3 is possible , depending on the details of the pressure profile . leaving a more comprehensive treatment to a future publication </S>",

    "<S> , the nonlinear evolution of the @xmath1 mode again proceeds explosively , following a very similar trajectory to the @xmath32 case . </S>",
    "<S> this point is illustrated in the brief discussion of the thermal quench below .    for both the @xmath32 and @xmath34 profiles , </S>",
    "<S> the thermal quench has a large convective component in the form of explosive @xmath40 ballooning fingers . also on a similar time scale , evolution of the ideal @xmath1 mode </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : punctureplots ] from a disruption that started with the @xmath34 profile . </S>",

    "<S> ironically , during the latter stages of the disruption , only the plasma in the explosive finger seems to be well - confined , as the flux surfaces remain intact only inside the finger .     </S>",
    "<S> very similar results are obtained with the @xmath32 profile.__,width=576 ]    as mentioned earlier , this explosive regime was not the initial goal of our studies , which concentrated on the `` long - lived '' @xmath3 mode observations in kstar@xcite . since it was clear that robustly unstable initial conditions will probably not yield a mode saturated at a small amplitude , as seen in the experiments , our search concentrated on equilibrium profiles near marginal stability where the @xmath1 was only weakly unstable . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the appearance of an eventual explosive regime when the initial linear growth rate @xmath66 or smaller was a surprise . </S>",
    "<S> since then we have observed the same behavior with higher initial growth rates ; the high resolution calculations presented here typically started from conditions with @xmath67    our numerical results are in qualitative agreement with cowley s theory@xcite on the explosive growth of ballooning fingers ( compare fig .  2 of ref .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : totalwkhistory](b ) with @xmath60 is much closer to the predictions of the toroidal theory </S>",
    "<S> . the small discrepancy may be due finite viscous dissipation and the perfectly conducting boundary conditions used in our simulations , although these have not been investigated in any detail .    while there have been other confirmations of the explosive nonlinear behavior ( see , for example , myers@xcite and the references therein ) , zhu _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ have failed to see it in their numerical simulations and have attributed this failure to the `` limited range of validity '' of the explosive regime@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this point might indeed be correct , but we would like to point out that in our studies of the @xmath1 mode , the formation of the thin , explosive finger , and approaching the finite - time singularity in time required us to retain a large number of higher harmonics of the @xmath1 mode ; we used up to @xmath62 in our toroidal fourier expansions . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear whether ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which looked at an @xmath79 ballooning mode , used a correspondingly wide toroidal spectrum in their numerical studies .    in summary , inherently explosive growth of an ideal @xmath1 mode - driven ballooning finger , with a predominantly @xmath2 component , </S>",
    "<S> has been demonstrated in nonlinear toroidal simulations . </S>",
    "<S> transition from exponential to explosive growth is driven nonlinearly by the characteristic quadrupole geometry of the @xmath40 pressure perturbation , which encourages the formation of a ballooning finger . </S>",
    "<S> the finger becomes narrower as it explosively pushes through flux surfaces , in qualitative agreement with published theories . </S>",
    "<S> this rapid convective loss of mass and energy from the core to the exterior , in some tens of alfvn times , provides an explanation for fast high-@xmath0 disruptions that occur with little or no precursors . </S>",
    "<S> although the thermal quench starts with the explosive ejection of the hot core , it is also aided , on a slower time scale , by parallel transport along stochastic fields that are generated during the explosive phase . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this letter was to bring to the attention of the fusion community in a timely manner , using fast and accurate nonlinear calculations in simple circular geometry , a significant and generic mechanism that may be responsible for high-@xmath0 disruptions in tokamaks with very fast precursors . </S>",
