    "the elliptic flow of particles in heavy ion collisions is a measure of the strength of the second fourier coefficient in the azimuthal angle distribution of particle transverse momentum relative to the reaction plane  @xcite .",
    "significant information on the properties of the hot dense matter formed during the initial stage of heavy ion collisions has been obtained from the study of elliptic flow  @xcite . in heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic )",
    "@xcite , measured elliptic flow at low transverse momentum shows a mass ordering , i.e. , the strength of elliptic flow of identified hadrons decreases with increasing hadron masses , and this has been well described by ideal hydrodynamics  @xcite as well as by the transport model  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the elliptic flows of identified hadrons , particularly at intermediate transverse momenta , are seen to follow a constituent quark number scaling , i.e. , the dependence of hadron elliptic flows on hadron transverse momentum becomes similar if both are divided by the number of constituent quarks in a hadron .",
    "this scaling behavior of hadron elliptic flows is consistent with the predictions of the quark coalescence model for hadron production from produced quark - gluon plasma in relativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "recently , the elliptic flow of deuteron has also been measured at rhic  @xcite .",
    "these measurements show that the deuteron elliptic flow seems to scale with its constituent nucleon number , implying that the quark number scaling of elliptic flows holds not only for hadrons but also for the deuteron .",
    "since deuteron production in heavy - ion collisions could be described by the coalescence of protons and neutrons at freeze out  @xcite , the observed nucleon number scaling of the deuteron elliptic flow is thus not surprising . in the simplest coalescence model  @xcite which involves only comoving particles",
    ", the deuteron yield in momentum space is proportional to the product of the proton and neutron densities at half the momentum of produced deuteron , i.e. , @xmath3 , and the deuteron elliptic flow would satisfy exactly the nucleon number scaling and thus the quark number scaling as well .",
    "this strong momentum constraint is relaxed in the more general coalescence model  @xcite that takes into account the nucleon momentum spread in the deuteron . as in the case of hadron production from quark coalescence  @xcite",
    ", the more general coalescence model would lead to a small deviation of the scaled deuteron elliptic flow from that of nucleons .",

    "some doubt has thus been raised on the applicability of the coalescence model , especially in low transverse momentum region  @xcite .",
    "investigating the consequences arising from the energy conservation condition is therefore required to test the coalescence model and to understand the constituent number scaling of elliptic flows in low transverse momentum region . in this work",

    "specifically , deuteron production in the present study will be treated through @xmath4 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 reactions . since",
    "this approach is based on physical scattering processes for deuteron production , the energy - momentum conservation is always satisfied . by comparing the physically allowed nucleon phase space for deuteron production with that involved in the coalescence model , we can study the consequences of the energy conservation condition . in a realistic study",
    ", these reactions need to be included in the hadronic stage of relativistic heavy ion collisions either via a microscopic transport model  @xcite or a schematic kinetic model  @xcite to take into account all possible deuteron production and dissociation processes .",
    "since the elliptic flow of particles during the hadronic evolution does not change much as the initial spatial asymmetry through which the elliptic flow is generated has decreased significantly during the evolution of the partonic stage  @xcite , we can therefore calculate the deuteron yield and elliptic flow based on the deuteron production rate from nucleons at freeze out .",

    "nucleon and pion transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flows , which are needed in both the coalescence model and the dynamical model for studying deuteron production , are discussed .",

    "[ fig : kin ] ) , the phase space in the three - to - two - body reactions has no restrictions on the angles and magnitudes of the momenta of three initial particles .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the deuteron elliptic flow in heavy - ion collisions at rhic using a dynamical model for deuteron production that conserves both momentum and energy . since elliptic flows in relativistic heavy ion collisions",
    "are mainly generated during early partonic stage , deuteron elliptic flow is expected to not change much during the hadronic stage , we have considered the deuteron production rate from the @xmath0 reaction at the thermal freeze out .",
    "the deuteron yield is then obtained from multiplying the production rate by the volume of the hadronic matter at freeze out and a time interval of about 4  fm/@xmath140 . because of the neglect of deuteron final - state interactions , which would enhance the incomplete treatment of radial flow effect , the resulting deuteron @xmath49 spectrum is somewhat softer than that measured in experiments . the obtained result for the deuteron @xmath65 agrees , however , reasonably with the measured one , except at very low @xmath49 where the latter is negative .",
    "our results further show that this model can reproduce the predictions from the coalescence model .",
    "the origin of this result could be understood from the physically allowed phase space of nucleon momenta in deuteron production . at large @xmath49",
    ", the phase space in our dynamical model covers that of the coalescence model , which eventually dominate the production process because of the nucleon distribution functions .",
    "therefore , our dynamical model supports the description of the coalescence model .",
    "however , at very low @xmath49 , the nucleon phase space in the coalescence model turns out to be physically forbidden because of energy - momentum conservation .",
    "thus , deuteron production via @xmath4 generally does not reproduce the prediction of the coalescence model at very low @xmath49 .",
    "although the prediction from the dynamical model follows the scaling behavior , this property is strongly dependent of the nucleon @xmath65 at the low @xmath49 region .",
    "we have also considered three - body @xmath1 and @xmath2 reactions for deuteron production in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "because of the different nucleon phase space involved in these reactions from that in the two - body @xmath27 reaction , these reactions lead to different predictions on the deuteron @xmath65 .",
    "the deuteron production rates from these reactions are , however , suppressed compared to that from the two - body @xmath0 reaction by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this implies that deuteron production in heavy - ion collisions is mainly due to the @xmath0 reaction , which has the largest cross section among the @xmath141 reactions  @xcite .",
    "we have also found that all models considered in the present study give positive deuteron @xmath65 at very low @xmath49 .",
    "this is in contrast to preliminary data from the star collaboration that deuterons produced in heavy ion collisions at rhic may have negative @xmath70 at very low @xmath49 region . to obtain negative deuteron @xmath71 required negative nucleon @xmath71 in the coalescence model",
    "therefore , precise measurements of both the nucleon and deuteron @xmath65 in this transverse momentum region are highly desirable for understanding the deuteron transverse momentum and elliptic flow in heavy - ion collisions . for our dynamical model approach ,",
    "there are several issues which deserve further studies . as mentioned in section  [ results ] , final - state interactions of deuterons , particularly the @xmath101 elastic scattering , need to be taken into account via a microscopic transport model or a schematic kinetic model .",
    "also , the deuteron production amplitude used in the present study assumes a point - like structure of the deuteron . for a more realistic description",
    ", the spread of the deuteron wave function should be taken into account in the production amplitude to render a more direct comparison with the coalescence model .",
