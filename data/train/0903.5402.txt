    "in the classical `` faraday experiment '' a fluid layer is submitted to vertical vibrations at a frequency @xmath0 and acceleration @xmath1  @xcite . by increasing the acceleration from zero , the system undergoes",
    "a bifurcation from a simple , well - defined state ( flat interface with zero velocity in the bulk ) to a more complex , destabilized state : at a given acceleration @xmath2 called the critical acceleration , the flat interface goes unstable and a surface wave pattern characterized by the critical wave number @xmath3 develops  @xcite .",
    "when the driving acceleration is further increased above @xmath2 , secondary instabilities take place  @xcite , leading at even higher accelerations to spatio - temporal chaos @xcite .",
    "together with the rayleigh - bnard convective instability , the faraday instability has often been described as a paradigm for the study of dynamical systems at the laboratory scale @xcite .    until about a decade ago",
    ", the faraday instability had been intensively studied in _ newtonian _",
    "fluids  @xcite .",
    "only recently have vertically vibrated complex fluids been the subject of experimental  @xcite and theoretical research  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the coupling between the microstructure of complex fluids and the faraday instability either only slightly modifies the instability ( e.g. by affecting the critical acceleration @xcite or by delaying the transition to disordered states @xcite ) or presents non - intuitive behaviours such as stabilized `` persistent holes '' in shear - thickening fluids  @xcite . with the notable exception of concentrated colloidal and granular suspensions @xcite ,",
    "most of these works were performed on fluids whose viscoelasticity is only a small perturbation  @xcite to newtonian behaviour .",
    "the case of a complex fluid with significant viscoelasticity was addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite and it was shown that viscoelasticity could lead to a harmonic response of the fluid surface ( _ i.e. _ at @xmath0 ) instead of the classical subharmonic response ( _ i.e. _ at @xmath4 ) .    in a previous paper  @xcite we reported onset measurements of the faraday instability in a semi - dilute surfactant solution ( cpycl  nasal at @xmath5  wt . )",
    "known to form an entangled network of `` wormlike '' micelles . in this",
    "very viscoelastic fluid , the critical acceleration and wave number were shown to present _ oscillations _ as a function of the driving frequency @xmath0 .",
    "we interpreted these oscillations in terms of _ standing elastic waves _ between the disturbed surface and the container bottom .",
    "the present article is devoted to a more thorough study of this striking effect of viscoelasticity on the faraday instability . after a brief description of our wormlike micellar system and of our experimental setup , we first present new sets of faraday experiments in various wormlike micelle solutions and explore the dependence of the fluid response on surfactant concentration and on temperature .",
    "then , the interpretation in terms of standing elastic waves is confirmed using two novel experiments : particle imaging velocimetry ( piv ) and birefringence under vertical vibrations , which show a non monotonic behaviour of the velocity and deformation fields along the vertical direction .",
    "we also use the finite - depth model of ref .",
    "@xcite to predict the velocity field .",
    "this numerical calculation accounts qualitatively for all our experimental observations .",
    "finally , reasons for quantitative discrepancies between the model and the experiments are discussed . in particular , birefringence measurements above onset show that the specific nonlinear features of the rheology of wormlike micelles , namely disentanglement and breakage of the micellar network and shear - induced alignment , do not come into play in our experiments .",
    "wormlike micelles are long ( typically hundreds of nanometers to tens of microns ) , cylindrical ( a few nanometers in diameter ) and flexible aggregates of surfactant molecules in aqueous solution @xcite .",
    "depending on the concentration and on the surfactant , wormlike micelle solutions present various characteristic behaviours : shear - thickenning at low concentration  @xcite , shear - induced alignment in the semi - dilute regime  @xcite , and equilibrium isotropic to nematic phase transition at even larger concentrations  @xcite . in the following we focus on _ semi - dilute",
    "_ solutions  @xcite .",
    "as shown by cates  @xcite , the unique viscoelastic behaviour , namely almost a perfect maxwell fluid @xcite , of these solutions is due to the interplay of two processes : reptation motion as in conventional polymers  @xcite and breaking and recombination of the micelles under thermal agitation .",
    "therefore , the complex viscosity of these solutions can be written : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the fluid zero - shear viscosity , @xmath8 the relaxation time , @xmath9 the pulsation , and @xmath10 a second characteristic time .    for a pure maxwell fluid , @xmath11 . however , due to the presence of the solvent , we shall rather use @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the solvent viscosity ( in our experiments , @xmath14  pa.s and @xmath15  pa.s ) .",
    "thus , in the case of a maxwell fluid , there are really only two free parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ eqo ] ) since @xmath10 simply derives from the solvent viscosity @xmath16 .",
    "another widely used model for the linear rheology of wormlike micelles is the oldroyd fluid whose complex viscosity is also given by eq .",
    "( [ eqo ] ) but where @xmath10 is left as a free parameter ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "we shall see below that this additional free parameter allows one to account for the behaviour of our solutions over a much larger frequency range than the maxwell fluid .",
    "note that such a use of the oldroyd model assumes the validity of the cox - merz rule which may be violated in some wormlike micelle solutions for @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we still use fits by the oldroyd model since equation  ( [ eqo ] ) yields good empirical representation of our data . also note that more elaborate models that account not only for the solvent but also for high frequency relaxation modes based on rouse or zimm approaches may apply to wormlike micelle solutions @xcite .",
    "finally we introduce the shear modulus as the high - frequency limit of the imaginary part of @xmath18 _ i.e. _ @xmath19 .    in the following , we study various wormlike micelle solutions made of cetylpyridinium chloride ( cpycl , from aldrich ) and sodium salicylate ( nasal , from acros organics ) dissolved in brine ( 0.5  m nacl ) with a fixed concentration ratio [ nasal]/[cpycl]=0.5 as described in refs .  @xcite . the cpycl  nasal concentration of our solutions varies from @xmath20 to @xmath21  wt .",
    "this concentration range ensures that ( i ) the micelles are in the semi - dilute regime , _",

    "instead we find a non - monotone dispersion relation .",

    "@xcite we proposed to interpret the oscillations in @xmath2 and @xmath3 as the signature of `` standing elastic waves '' across the cell .",
    "indeed in a strongly viscoelastic fluid , the disturbed surface is likely to generate shear waves that propagate downward across the fluid layer , are reflected at the bottom of the cell , backpropagate toward the surface where they may interact with the surface wave provided the attenuation over a distance @xmath58 is not too large .",
    "the velocity of shear waves is given by @xmath59 for a maxwell or an oldroyd fluid in the @xmath60 limit , which is always verified in our experiments ( from table  [ tab1 ] , @xmath61 is in the range 25400 ) . using this simplification",
    "one can calculate the phase of the reflected shear wave as it reaches the surface .",
    "indeed , the total travel time from the surface to the bottom of the cell and back to the surface is @xmath62 , which corresponds to a phase shift @xmath63 since the response of the surface is subharmonic .",
    "moreover the no slip boundary condition at the bottom of the cell leads to an additional phase shift of @xmath64 so that the phase of the reflected shear wave at the surface is @xmath65 . if @xmath66 , with @xmath67 an integer , the reflected shear wave and the surface wave are in phase leading to constructive interference , amplification of the surface wave , and a local minimum of @xmath2 . on the other hand , when @xmath68 , the interference is destructive and surface waves are hindered , leading to a local maximum of @xmath2 , hence the oscillations of fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",

    "however , for @xmath112  hz , the critical acceleration found numerically remains smaller than the experimental one by about 20% .    at this stage the lack of rheological data at frequencies larger than 40  hz does not allow us to draw any definite conclusion on whether a better agreement between theory and experiment would be achieved by using a more elaborate rheological model at high frequencies .",
    "experimental imperfections such as absorption of shear waves at the bottom of the container or additional dissipation at the walls , which are not taken into account in the numerical calculation , may also account for the observed discrepancies .",
    "another possibility is the fact that surface waves may affect the microstructure of the fluid in a nonlinear way ( see sect .  [ sbiref ] below ) .",
    "therefore we did not try to look further for more appropriate rheological models but we rather focused on the original features of the faraday instability in our strongly viscoelastic fluid , namely the presence of elastic waves across the sample .",
    "interestingly the velocity field @xmath89 of a vertically vibrated viscoelastic fluid at onset can be inferred from the numerical model of ref .",
