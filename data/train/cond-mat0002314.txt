    "in the previous paper @xcite , we showed how one could extend the methodology originally devised by @xcite and obtain a closed form solution for mode iii cracks propagating steadily in a square lattice in the presence of dissipation in the form of a kelvin viscosity .",
    "this approach allowed us to determine the effect of dissipation on the crack velocity as a function of driving .",
    "similarly , we found the critical velocity ( and the associated critical time ) at which other bonds in the lattice have displacements larger than the assumed breaking criterion , signaling an instability in the steadily - propagating crack and the onset of more complex spatio - temporal behavior .    in this second paper , we extend this analysis to the more interesting ( and more experimentally relevant ) case of mode i cracks .",
    "we now work on a triangular lattice and assume that there are central force ideally brittle viscoelastic springs connecting particles at the lattice sites .",
    "again , we use ideas borrowed from @xcite to solve this problem exactly on an infinite lattice",
    ". we also solve the same system numerically on a lattice of finite transverse extent so as to provide an independent check on some of the results .",
    "perhaps the most interesting finding reported here concerns the aforementioned onset of additional bond - breaking at large enough velocity . at small dissipation ,",
    "diagonal bonds that are offset from the assumed crack line in the vertical direction are the most  dangerous \" .",
    "the critical velocity at which one of these bonds exceeds critical displacement is more or less independent of the dissipation at low values thereof and eventually rises sharply as the system becomes increasingly damped .",
    "this is similar to the behavior obtained for mode iii . at moderate to large",
    "damping , however , horizontal bonds become more relevant and eventually give rise to a critical velocity which decreases with increasing damping . at the end , we will comment on the possible relevance of our results for trying to make sense of recent experiments @xcite and simulations on instabilities during dynamic fracture .",
    "our model consists of central force springs between mass points located on a triangular lattice .",
    "we introduce unit vectors in the lattice directions as follows : @xmath0 points in the direction of the @xmath1-axis and each of the subsequent unit vectors @xmath2 with @xmath3 rotated by an additional @xmath4 in the counter - clockwise direction .",
    "this means that @xmath5 .",
    "we will always assume that the steady - state crack breaks bonds between the rows with @xmath6 and @xmath7 , as it moves in the direction of the @xmath1-axis .",
    "as already discussed in our previous paper on mode iii cracks , each bond is taken to be linear until a critical displacement at which point it completely breaks .",
    "also , dissipation is incorporated as a kelvin viscosity term .",
    "given these assumptions , the equation describing the motion of the masses in the lattice is @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is a lattice vector in the plane and @xmath10 is the elongation of bond @xmath11 emanating from the specific lattice site , in the approximation that this elongation is much smaller than the unstretched bond length , @xmath12 finally , the driving term @xmath13 consists of forces which compensate for the forces from broken bonds ( which are included on the left - hand side ) as well as any external forces acting on the crack boundaries .",
    "next we suppose that the crack is moving with a constant speed @xmath14 .",
    "this allows us to change variables to @xmath15 , @xmath16 , which gives @xmath17 because of the form of @xmath18 , we have the obvious symmetries @xmath19 we will impose one additional symmetry condition on the @xmath20 . as the crack propagates",
    ", it alternately breaks bonds in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 directions .",
    "let us define our coordinates such that at @xmath23 and @xmath24 , ( so that @xmath25 ) , the crack breaks a bond in the direction of @xmath21 .",
    "this means that for @xmath26 this bond ( @xmath27 with @xmath28 ) is unbroken and for @xmath29 it is always broken .",
    "if we shift one lattice spacing to the left , the @xmath21 bond at @xmath30 will break at @xmath31 ( here also @xmath32 in @xmath27 ) .",
    "it is clear that the bond in the @xmath22 direction at @xmath25 breaks at a time - point between these two events ; we will assume that this time is exactly at the midpoint , @xmath33 or equivalently @xmath34 in @xmath35 .",
    "this means that for @xmath36 this bond is unbroken and for @xmath37 it is always broken .",
    "we will assume an even more strict symmetry condition for these bonds , namely @xmath38 which will need to be checked from our solution later .    let us denote @xmath39 .",
    "then , we can write down an explicit expression for the forces @xmath40 on the right hand side of eq . [ eqv ] . for the row with @xmath6 @xmath41 here @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the assumed external forces . in the second form , these have been taken to match the vectorial nature and also the symmetry of the bond - breaking terms .",
    "the ( scalar ) @xmath44 will be specified later .",
    "note that the second theta - function in ( [ force01 ] ) reflects the already mentioned fact that the bond from point @xmath45 in the @xmath22 direction breaks earlier ( by time interval @xmath46 ) than the bond from the same point in the @xmath21 direction .",
    "let us write down the corresponding force for the row @xmath47 .",
    "for the point @xmath48 , the bond in the @xmath49 direction is physically the same as the @xmath21 bond at @xmath50 and therefore breaks at @xmath23 in @xmath51 .",
    "now , the @xmath52 bond at @xmath53 breaks later , at @xmath54 in @xmath55 .",
    "thus we have @xmath56 where we used the symmetry in eq . [ cond ] to write @xmath57 .",

    "therefore , we do not need to repeat any of the discussion from our previous paper regarding the choice of @xmath124 and the factorization into pieces analytic in the upper and lower half planes .",

    "in this section we calculate the bond displacements in the vicinity of the crack .",
    "this is crucial , as we need to check whether all bonds assumed to be unbroken in the derivation in fact have elongations less than unity , the value at which bonds break .",

    "given the elongations of these  vulnerable \" bonds , we can investigate the critical speed at which one of these bonds should be broken .",
    "figure [ figure12 ] shows the results of our calculations of this critical speed . in figure [ figure13 ]",
    "we plotted @xmath179 at which these bonds break ; this will allow us to identify spatial and time coordinates of braking and make contact with our finite lattice calculations later .",
    "we found that the maximum value of @xmath180 always reaches 1 before @xmath181 and that this is the most dangerous bond for small dissipation .",
    "this curve turns around at an @xmath135 of around @xmath182 , so that @xmath180 is always subcritical for larger @xmath135 .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the maximum value of @xmath180 is , surprisingly enough , not monotonic with velocity , but reaches a maximum and then decreases with increasing velocity .",
    "the maximum extension of this type of bond occurs , for large velocity , at some distance from the crack surface . for small @xmath135 ,",
    "where the maximum @xmath180 does exceed critical extension , the decrease of the maximum @xmath183 with @xmath14 restabilizes the bond beyond some velocity .",
    "the dominant threshold for @xmath135 above about @xmath184 , then , comes from the horizontal bond breaking .",
    "note that as @xmath135 increases , the critical velocity decreases .",
    "also , for small @xmath135 , a crossover occurs as the relative importance of the two different maxima in the horizontal bond elongation reverse ; this region is anyway irrelevant as the next - layer vertical bond breaks at a lower velocity . whenever the horizontal bond dominates , the maximum at @xmath185 is the governing one .",
    "as we see from figure [ figure13 ] even for large @xmath135 this critical @xmath60 stays near @xmath161 , what means that horizontal bond always breaks near the tip of the crack , contrary to the mode iii case , where the point of breaking drifts backward with increasing @xmath135 .",
    ", width=312 ]        many of these features are special to the mode i problem , and have no analog in the mode iii calculation . for mode iii , the horizontal bond breaking always dominates .",
    "furthermore , the maximum off - crack surface bond extension is a strictly increasing function of the velocity .",
    "this points to the possibility that the dynamics of mode i may be much richer than the mode iii dynamics .",
    "for our mode iii calculations , it proved interesting to compare the exact results derived for an infinite lattice with the numerical determination of crack propagation properties in lattices of small transverse size @xcite .",
    "we now discuss similar calculations for our mode i model .",
    "in addition to providing details regarding the size needed to attain answers relevant to the macroscopic limit ( a question of direct relevance for direct molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , for example ) , finite lattice results can be used as a rough check on some of the predictions obtained above . given the complexity of the analysis , having such a check is quite useful .",
    "let us start with trying to find arrested cracks , expected to exist in some range of the driving @xmath186 around the griffith s displacement .",
    "this involves looking for a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) with @xmath187 independent of time and with the forces on the right hand side arising solely from the broken bonds .",
    "if we have a system with a finite number of rows , the natural boundary condition requires that the top and bottom rows have fixed vertical displacements of @xmath186 and @xmath188 respectively .",
    "since the entire system is linear , we can choose to use @xmath189 and rescale the breaking criterion accordingly .",
    "since we are doing a numerical calculation , we must introduce artificial boundaries in the direction along the crack , @xmath190 .",
    "what we do is cut off the range of points whose coordinates are variables and outside of this range impose fixed asymptotic displacements . on the cracked side ,",
    "these are just @xmath191 for positive and negative @xmath192 . for the uncracked side ,",
    "the asymptotic displacement involves constant strain . at each of the sites that has a variable displacement , we impose the two components of the ( vectorial ) equation of motion .",
    "we also impose the equations of motion at the boundaries of the system .",
    "this gives us more equations than we have variables .",
    "the coupling of sites which contain variable displacements with the ones with fixed displacements gives rise to inhomogeneous terms .",
    "combining these observations , we can write our system in the schematic form @xmath193 , with a non - square matrix @xmath194 .",
    "the field @xmath195 is then determined by the requirement that the error be minimal . in this manner ,",
    "the small errors introduced at the boundary by having to have a fixed box size are prevented from causing any large errors ( by modes which grow exponentially away from the edges ) in the bulk of the lattice .",
    "the solution of this linear system determines the elongation of all bonds . in figure [ figure7 ]",
    "we show a typical lattice given by this solution .",
    "in fact we need to know elongation of just two bonds right at the tip of the crack ; the one which in the case of the moving crack would break next ( @xmath196 ) and the other which would have been the last one broken ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "now , recall that we have scaled our displacement to equal unity and the only remaining displacement scale is the elongation at which the springs break , which we can call @xmath198 .",
    "the solution we have found is consistent as long as @xmath198 is between the lower limit set by the @xmath196 and the upper limit set by @xmath197 . since @xmath199 , where @xmath200 is the number of rows in the @xmath192-direction ( excluding the boundary rows whose displacement is constrained ) , we directly obtain the upper and lower limits of the arrested crack band @xmath201 the results for these thresholds as a function of lattice size are shown in figs .",

    "now we can discretize our system , obtaining equations at times @xmath211 .",
    "we use a symmetric discretization of first and second derivatives @xmath212 and @xmath213 correspondingly .",
    "these equations depend on displacements @xmath214 outside of this time interval , because of the temporal derivatives .",
    "these can be found via use of the assumed symmetries of the moving crack ; in fact , it is easy to see that we thereby trade in displacements outside of the modeled interval with displacements inside this interval albeit at a different spatial location .",
    "the boundaries are treated the same way as described for the arrested crack ; the displacements outside some range are replaced by asymptotic values for all of the time - points in our interval . including the equations at these boundary points",
    "again gives us a system in which the number of equations exceeds the number of variables and again a least squared error algorithm is used to find the required solution .",

    "( [ figure14b ] ) , we compare the @xmath232 results to those for @xmath233 . since the steady - state code is difficult to run at these large values of @xmath219 , the data in these two plots were obtained from time - dependent simulations , with only the central vertical bonds allowed to break . after running to times of @xmath234 to eliminate transients ,",
    "the extensions of the dangerous bonds were checked to see if they exceeded criticality .",
    "note that , in contradistinction to the `` phase diagram '' plotted in fig .",
    "( [ figure12 ] ) , we now plot @xmath132 on the vertical axis , since this is the input control parameter for the simulations .",
    "we see that qualitative behavior of the `` @xmath183 '' bonds is similar to the infinite-@xmath219 result , with these bonds being below critical extension for both large @xmath135 and large @xmath132 .",
    "the horizontal bonds also behave qualitatively like their infinite-@xmath219 counterparts , but the quantitative agreement , is as we noted above , significantly worse .",
    "in fact , for large @xmath135 , the most dangerous bond is in fact of `` @xmath235 '' type .",
    "however , the threshold at which the `` @xmath235 '' type bond becomes dominant is pushed to larger @xmath135 as the system size is increased , presumably going to infinity with @xmath219 . also , there is a small region of @xmath135 around 1.1 where the inconsistency is re - entrant , so that for intermediate values of @xmath186 , no bonds of the crack surface are critical .",
    "thus , to see dynamics qualitatively representative of the macroscopic system requires very large system sizes at moderate to large @xmath135 . presumably , this is connected to the process zone increasing in size with @xmath135 .",
    "again , it is worth emphasizing that this is a feature not present in mode iii , and leads to the conclusion that in molecular dynamics simulations , the width of the material should be taken very large to accurately study the micro - branching instability .     and @xmath232,width=312 ]     and @xmath233.,width=312 ]",
    "in this work , we have discussed steady - state mode i crack propagation in a viscoelastic lattice model . our primary method of analysis utilizes the wiener - hopf technique to write down closed form expressions for both the @xmath236 curves ( for various values of the dissipation @xmath135 ) and for the bond elongation field .",
    "the latter enables us to define a limit of consistency for the solution past which some bonds not along the crack path have elongations greater than the assumed breaking criterion .",
    "these results are new , and correspond to non - trivial extensions of the work of @xcite on the dissipationless limit and the work of @xcite on small lattices .    the most interesting results , in our opinion , concern the dependence of the critical velocity ( where the aforementioned inconsistency sets in ) on the amount of dissipation . for small dissipation",
    ", this threshold is relatively insensitive to @xmath135 , as already suggested in direct numerical simulations .",
    "this threshold , occurring at roughly .73 of the rayleigh speed is in some ways reminiscent of the @xcite branching criterion which suggests that straight crack propagation will become unstable once the largest stress direction shifts away from being straight ahead .",
    "it is unfortunately hard to be more precise regarding this correspondence since the crack dynamics in our model is fundamentally tied to the lattice scale , not the macroscopic scale - in fact , the latter is completely invisible in the slepyan approach aside from providing a driving force in the form of a stress intensity factor .    at larger @xmath135 , the instability picture changes .",
    "now , it is a horizontal bond breaking which signals the onset of more complex crack dynamics .",
    "also , the threshold goes down with increasing dissipation .",
    "this was not the case for our mode iii calculations .",
    "this instability has nothing to do with yoffe , as it is strongly dissipation dependent and in any case is not associated with crack branching .",
    "much of the recent theoretical work on mode i cracks has been motivated by experiments which show clearly that instabilities limit the range of steady - state crack propagation .",
    "these instabilities introduce more complex spatio - temporal dynamics to the fracture process , causing additional dissipation and leaving behind a roughened crack surface .",
    "it has been tempting to associate these results with the onset of inconsistencies in lattice models , although the details of this correspondence remains uncertain .",
    "first , most of the experimental work has been carried out in amorphous materials , making the idea of an ordered lattice model somewhat suspect .",
    "next , the instabilities seen experimentally typically occur at smaller speeds than the ones seen in lattice systems with small dissipation .",
    "finally , the experiments seem to show a typical frequency for micro - branching which is not connected in any obvious way to dynamics at a lattice scale .    notwithstanding all these issues ,",
    "we remain optimistic that the study of this class of models will lead to insight into dynamic fracture .",
    "there are several intriguing possibilities that need to be investigated in the future .",
    "first , we have shown that for mode i cracks , increasing the dissipation ( in the form of a kelvin viscosity ) eventually results in a decrease of the instability threshold . if our model is really applied at the atomic scale , it is hard to see why there should be a large linear dissipation ; on the other hand , it is well - known that lattice models miss an essential non - linear dissipation mechanism , namely the creation of dislocations which remain pinned to the crack",
    ". would inclusion of these effects also lower the threshold ? on the other hand , applying the model on a large scale ( possibly for a disordered system ) would naturally require a large dissipation and recent numerical simulations indicate that proper inclusion of the thermal fluctuations might also push the model into better agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "finally , the exact nature of the state which occurs past the instability onset has not been addressed in our work to date , and in fact can not be addressed by the elegant but ultimately limiting analytic methods utilized for the steady - state problem .",
    "instead , we plan to study a generalized force law in which the sharp breaking criterion is replaced by an analytic nonlinear force versus displacement @xcite . in this formulation ,",
    "the inconsistency found here becomes a linear instability of the steady - state crack @xcite and one can use some of the methods developed in the field of nonequilibrium pattern formation to unravel the dynamics past onset .",
    "these studies , together with additional experimental data regarding the differences between brittle fracture in crystalline versus non - crystalline materials , will hopefully lead to a better understanding of dynamic fracture .",
