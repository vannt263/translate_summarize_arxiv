    "the objective of this work is to demonstrate that the force changes evoked by the cardiac activity and measured by the force plate can be used to trace the motion of the heart muscle and the pulse propagation along the aorta .",
    "in particular the recoils caused by the pulse wave scattering on certain morphological structures ( for instance on the aortal arch ) can be recognized and used to determine the time points when a pulse wave reaches given location .",
    "the idea itself is not new .",
    "the usage of body micro movements for extracting information about the cardiac activity is the principle of ballistocardiography - a field that is worked out for more then 50 years @xcite . nowadays",
    "the body motion is usually traced by a sensitive low frequency accelerometers fastened on the sternum @xcite . in the past various method",
    "has been used ranging from pendulous bed to induction coils .",
    "( movements of the body occurring synchronously with the pulse were first reported already by gordon ( 1887 ) using an ordinary spring weighing machine @xcite ) .",
    "similar methodology derived from the field of seismology is known as seismocardiography .",
    "@xcite .    to elucidate the cardiac dynamics",
    "more closely a three dimensional ballistocardiography was developed at late eighties @xcite . using a special platform the body motion",
    "was traced in three mutually orthogonal directions .",
    "more recently similar measurements have been done also in sustained microgravity during cosmic flights - see for instance @xcite .",
    "a multidimensional measurement allows a better classification of the vascular recoil since the arteries form a three dimensional system leading to micro movements in different directions .",
    "the standard ballistocardiography is established on registering the _ motion ( or acceleration ) of the body .",
    "we use another technique based on a direct measurements of _ forces and moments induced by the cardiac activity .",
    "a similar method was described in @xcite . to measure the forces we used a stiff bed mounted on the top of a standard bertec force plate , model  4060a , equipped with strain gage transducers .",
    "the force plate is capable to detect independently the force and moment components in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 directions with a precision of 0.1 n and nm respectively .",
    "a volunteer was reclining on the bed on the back without voluntary movements .",
    "so the recorded force and moment changes were evoked mainly by the mass motion inside his body .",
    "( due to the relaxed position the body tremor can be neglected . ) simultaneously with the force changes the ecg signal registered by a one - channel electrocardiograph was recorded .",
    "all signals were digitized with a ad converter with sampling rate of 1 khz .",
    "this yields together to a seven dimensional time series that has to be inspected . _",
    "_    the clue is however not contained in the measured data but rather in the method we used to uncover the underlying processes .",
    "we understand the time series measured by the force plate as coordinate projections of a six dimensional geometric object - a signal curve . to extract the information contained in the signal curve we will investigate its geometric properties . in particular we focus on the geometric invariants .",
    "geometric invariants do not change when the curve is rotated , translated or its parametrization is changed .",
    "this is in contrast with its coordinate projections ( measured signals ) that change under such transformations .",
    "it is clear that if we , for instance , slightly change the position of the measured body , the intrinsic hemodynamical process will be not affected .",
    "but the individual force components measured by the plate will change .",
    "the geometric invariants of the signal curve will , however , remain unchanged .    in a three dimensional space",
    "geometric invariants are usually used as shape and object descriptors and apply , for instance , in computerized object recognition -see @xcite . the idea behind",
    "this effort is simple : the invariants set the clue that remains unchanged when the object moves , rotates or the view perspective changes .",
    "moreover they help to distinguish different object shapes etc .",
    "these invariants usually describe the vertices and edges of the object .",
    "in fact there is an impressive amount of various invariants used in the three dimensional space .",
    "but not all of them suitable in higher dimensions .    here",
    "we will use invariants known as cartan curvatures @xcite that apply naturally in spaces with arbitrary dimension .",
    "mathematically this invariants are based on the concept of local coordinate frames associated with a curve . in a given point one",
    "axis of the local frame is tangential to the curve , the second axis represents the normal , the third is the binormal etc . roughly speaking",
    "when we consider a smooth @xmath3-dimensional curve  @xmath4 , there is for each parameter @xmath5 an orthogonal frame @xmath6 of @xmath3-dimensional vectors such that the @xmath7th derivative @xmath8 of the curve @xmath4 can be expressed as a linear combination of its first @xmath7 vectors @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the family @xmath6 is called the distinguished frenet frame . the curvatures @xmath11 , @xmath12 of the curve  @xmath13 are defined by frenet - serret formulae as @xmath14 so the curvatures characterize local changes of the coordinate system related with the curve . in our case",
    "the signal curve is 6  dimensional and is characterized by 5  curvatures .",
    "mechanical events like a heart beat or a scattering of the pulse wave on an arterial bifurcation lead to recoil and is registered by the force plate .",
    "it might be difficult to trace up this response just by inspecting the time series representing the individual force and moment components .",
    "but the events change the geometry of the total signal curve .",
    "hence they will be visible as a changeover of its invariants .",
    "we use this strategy to trace up the footprints of the hemodynamics in the force plate signal .",
    "it turns out that for this purpose it is enough to investigate the first cartan curvature @xmath15 only .",
    "we have investigated a sample of 20 healthy young adult males .",
    "they were asked to recline on the back in a relaxed position without voluntary motion . the measurement with",
    "an 8 minute data acquisition started always after a calm down period of at least 5 minutes    the cardiac cycle is triggered by the electric activity represented in the ecg signal .",
    "we used ( in a consent with the literature _ cf . _",
    "@xcite ) the absolute maximum of the ecg r wave as the starting point .",
    "the response of the plate was registered for time intervals that started 300 ms before a particular r wave and terminated 600 ms after it .",
    "this time interval covers usually the whole cardiac cycle . during the time period the heart contracts and the blood ejection takes place .",
    "the corresponding pulse wave shoots along the aorta passing its main branchings .",
    "finally the heart muscle relaxes in the diastolic part of the cycle .    in all measured cases we discovered several clear changes ( maxima ) of the curvature that come up with constant time delays with respect to the r wave .",
    "it is natural to assume that such are linked to events related to cardiovascular system .",
    "this expectation is strengthened by the fact that the obtained time delays are similar for all measured subjects .",
    "in addition there is a clear correlation between the observed event ( change in the curvature ) and the size of the stature of the measured person : longer persons embody longer time delays .",
    "this fits well with the hypothesis that relates the changes of the geometry of the signal curve to the motion of the heart muscle and to the scattering of the ejected blood on various morphological structures of the arterial system .",
    "we get naturally longer time delays between the r wave and the specific scattering event for taller persons . simply because the distance to be passed by the pulse is longer .    to get a direct evidence that supports the above hypothesis is , however , not easy .",
    "it is rather simple to observe the motion of the heart muscle ( for instance with echography ) and compare the results with the signal changes of the force plate .",
    "but a noninvasive observation of the pulse wave propagation is difficult .",
    "the process is very quick and the time resolution of a standard echograph fails to resolve it- see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it can be noninvasively examined only by special - purpose devices that were inaccessible for us .    to find the way out we asked for collaboration physicians and patients from the catheterization unit of the university hospital in hradec kralove . before the examination on the catheterization unit we inspected the patient on the force plate using the method described above . later on the same patient",
    "was examined with a catheter equipped with a pressure transducer . during the investigation",
    "the blood pressure inside various locations of the aorta and the left ventricle was recorded . since the ecg signal is recorded simultaneously with the pressure it is possible to set the time lag between the r wave and the arrival of the pulse wave at a given location .",
    "the arrival of the pulse wave is characterized by an rapid increase of the local pressure .",
    "the pulse shape is however not rectangular .",
    "we define the time of the pulse arrival as the point of the maximal pressure increase i.e. as the maximum of the derivative of the measured pressure signal .",
    "similar method was used in @xcite where pressures were recorded at five regions from the ascending aorta to the iliac artery .",
    "the knowledge about the pulse wave propagation obtained invasively during the catheterization enables us to verify the hypothesis that relates the observed sudden changes of the curvature of signal curve to the internal hemodynamical process . to do this we compared the arrival times of the pulse wave measured during the catheterization with times characterizing the localizations of the curvature peaks by the same person .",
    "we compared the curvature peaks with the pulse arrival times on the following arterial structures :    * truncus brachiocephalicus * top of the aortal arch * the place where the aorta comes through diaphragm * splitting of arteria renalis * the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta to the common iliac arteries * the bifurcation of the common iliac arteries into the artheria iliaca interna and artheria iliaca externa * junction of the artheria iliaca externa and artheria femoralis    the results are encouraging .",
    "some of the pronounced peaks observed in the curvatures appear exactly at times when the pulse wave reach anatomically distinguished positions and is scattered .",
    "typical results are plotted on figure  [ hemo ] .",
    "the agreement is remarkable . especially for isolated events .",
    "when the recoil is weak it is usually not resolved by the first curvature .",
    "a typical example is the arrival of the pulse wave to the aortal iliac bifurcation where the aorta is divided into the two common iliac arteries .",
    "the pulse wave transmission on this structure is very smooth and the related recoil is small .",
    "so the process is usually not visible with the help of the first cartan curvature .",
    "but it is uncovered when a second curvature is used - see the insert of the figure  [ hemo ] .",
    "another problematic situation occurs when there are several subsequent scatterings of the pulse wave within a very short time interval .",
    "this happens below the diaphragm . here",
    "the pulse wave scatters on the diaphragm , on the celiac artery splitting , mesenteric artery and on the renal arteries .",
    "all there structures are localized close to each other .",
    "the first curvature does not resolve the events and joints them into one peak and higher cartan curvatures have to be used .",
    "the insert of the figure  [ hemo ] shows that the third curvature resolves correctly the pulse scattering on renal arteries .",
    "there are , however , curvature peaks that appear before the qrs complex and can not be related to the pulse wave propagation .",
    "other curvature peaks , on the contrary , refer to time delays that are longer than the time during which the pulse wave propagates along the arterial tree .",
    "we will demonstrate that these peaks are directly associated with the motion of the heart muscle .",
    "one of the signals obtained during the catheterization is the left ventricular pressure .",
    "since the heart motion leads to well defined pressure changes this signal can be used to trace the mechanical myocardial motion .",
    "the heart motion starts with the contraction of the left atrium which raises the left atrium pressure and leads finally to the ejection of the blood from the left atrium into the left ventricle ( the a wave ) .",
    "this process is measurable as a small pressure increase in the left ventricle .",
    "the atrium contraction is followed by the contraction of the ventricle .",
    "the ventricular pressure increases quickly and eventually exceeds the atrium pressure .",
    "this leads to a back flow that closes the mitral valve . at this stage both",
    "the mitral and aortic valves are closed .",
    "the continuing rapid ventricular contraction ( isovolumic contraction ) leads to an increase of the pressure that eventually opens the aortic valve and ejects the blood into the aortic root .",
    "similar process ( with a possible small time delay ) takes place also in the right part of the heart .",
    "however the pressure changes are much smaller there and result to minor force response of the plate .",
    "there are usually 2 curvature peaks preceding the q wave .",
    "these peaks appear after the p wave which marks the electric trigger for the atrial contraction .",
    "there is a clear link between the peaks and small pressure changes in the left ventricle .",
    "the first peak is related with a small increase of the left ventricular pressure caused by the atrial contraction .",
    "the position of this peak coincides with the local maximum of the derivative of the pressure signal measured in the left ventricle between the p and q waves - see the inset @xmath16 in the figure 2 .",
    "the second curvature peak is associated with a small plateau - like local maximum of the left ventricular pressure and follows closely the q wave of the ecg signal .",
    "we assume that this peak reflects the force changes associated with the beginning of the ventricular systole .",
    "the r wave is followed by a sequence of 2 - 3 curvature peaks .",
    "the most important is the first of them .",
    "it marks the onset of the rapid pressure increase in the left ventricle ( isovolumic contraction ) and reflects the enclosure of the bicuspid valve ( when a heart sound is measured this peak coincides exactly with the beginning of the first heart sound ) .",
    "the remaining peaks of this series are associated with heart muscle motion due to the isovolumic contraction .",
    "it ends with the aortal valve opening .",
    "the valve opening is , however , not instantaneous .",
    "it starts at the moment when the ventricular pressure equals to the pressure inside the aortal root .",
    "but , as the systole holds on , the ventricular pressure may - for a short time period - exceed the aortal pressure .",
    "whenever the aortal valve opens fully these pressures match .",
    "the opening of the aortal valve is clearly distinguished as an anacrotic notch - a bump in the measured aortal pressure .",
    "at the same time the curvature of the force plate signal curve shows a sharp and high peak .",
    "it stays for the aortal valve opening and for the beginning of the blood election into the aortal root .",
    "the discussed systolic part of the cardiac cycle is characterized by a rapid heart muscle contractions and pulse wave propagation .",
    "the diastolic part of the cycle , during which the heart muscle relaxes and is passively filled with blood , does not contain any abrupt motions .",
    "nevertheless it is also related with an internal mass motion and hence measurable by the force plate .    from the point of view of the measured pressure the ventricular diastole",
    "is characterized by two main event .",
    "it starts with the closure of the aortal valve which is recognized as the dicrotic notch in the aortal pressure signal . during the first part of diastole the ventricular pressure falls down rapidly",
    "this pressure drop stops at the moment when the mitral valve opens and the blood flows into the ventricle - passive ventricular filling .",
    "the atrial diastole precedes the ventricular one and takes place already during the ventricular systole .",
    "so it is superimposed by it .",
    "the curvature of the force plate signal detects the ventricular diastole as a sequence of several overlapping peaks .",
    "this sequence starts with the aortal valve closure that is marked by the dicrotic notch and/or ( if the sound is recorded ) by the second heart sound .",
    "it ends short after the termination of the sudden drop of the ventricular pressure , i.e. after the opening of the mitral valve .",
    "this sequence of peaks is followed by one or a couple of well pronounced curvature maxima representing the first ( rapid ) phase of ventricular filling i.e. the phase when the blood accumulation in the atrium during the atrial diastole flows rapidly into the ventricle .",
    "this phase is followed by the atrial systole that has been already described .",
    "an typical example of the obtained curvature and pressures measured in the left ventricle and aortal root is plotted on the figure  [ trnka2 ] .",
    "the curvature pattern described in the previous section is reproducible .",
    "herewith we mean the following :    * it is stable during the heart cycle .",
    "this means that the curvature peaks appear with almost constant time delay with respect to the r wave of the ecg signal .",
    "the probability distributions of time delays referring to the peaks 1,2,4,5 and 7 of the figure  [ hemo ] are plotted on the figure  [ distrib ] . * as mentioned repeatedly in this paper : the curvatures are geometric invariants of the signal curve .",
    "so it is not surprising that the position of the peaks is not sensitive to the particular position of the body as long as the internal hemodynamical process is not changed .",
    "we measured the subjects on the back and on the belly .",
    "the position of the peaks is the same in both cases .",
    "but their hight might change . * in several cases we measured the force plate response once more after a time interval of three months .",
    "the position of the curvature peaks was stable , i.e. it has not changed when the same patient was measured again .",
    "* the geometric properties of the signal curve are analogous for different people .",
    "for instance in a sample of 25 examined volunteers the curvature peak that stands for the blood injection into the aortal root appeared in the mean 80 ms after the r wave with a standard deviation of 8 ms .    .",
    "the times of the pulse wave arrival obtained during catheterization are plotted as dashed lines ]    all this together shows that the changes of the geometric invariants of the signal curve obtained by a force plate are suitable to display the internal hemodynamical processes .",
    "it has to be stressed that the method is fully noninvasive .",
    "all what is needed is that the patient reclines quietly on a bed equipped with force transducers . then the pulse wave propagation and",
    "the mechanical strokes of the heart muscle can be monitored in real time ( online ) .",
    "this may be used to trace out for instance the immediate influence of an administered drug etc .",
    "we used the first cartan curvature to reveal the information contained in the signal curve .",
    "similar results are obtained also when higher curvatures are inspected .",
    "the main difference is that higher curvatures are more sensitive to the signal noise . on the other hand - as demonstrated above -",
    "some smooth processes are better visible with the help of higher curvatures .",
    "similar effect can be reached when the body position is changed . when the subject is measured on the belly instead on the back some recoils",
    "are intensified and the related curvature maxima are more pronounced .",
    "a typical example is the celiac artery splitting .",
    "it is badly visible when the subject reclines on the back .",
    "but it leads to well pronounced peak when the measurement is done on the belly .",
