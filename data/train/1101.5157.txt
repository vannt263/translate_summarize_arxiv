    "weak gravitational lensing has become one of the most powerful techniques for investigating the distribution of dark matter on cosmological scales ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the majority of weak lensing studies to date have been conducted in the optical bands since large numbers of galaxies are required to reduce the shape noise associated with the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies .",
    "observationally , the pace of progress in the optical is set to continue with forthcoming wide - field surveys using a number of purpose - built instruments , e.g.  des , kids , euclid , wfirst and pan - starrs .",
    "as the statistical precision of optical surveys improves , greater control over potential systematics is required .",
    "major systematics of concern include instrumental effects such as anisotropies in the point - spread function ( psf ) of the telescope and astrophysical systematics such as intrinsic galaxy alignments ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to a new generation of wide - field optical surveys , a suite of powerful next - generation radio instruments are due to come online in the near future .",
    "radio instruments offer a number of potential advantages over optical surveys for lensing studies .",
    "in particular , radio interferometers do not suffer from complicated psf effects , their synthesized beams being precisely and solely determined by the telescope array configuration and direction of observation .",
    "a further unique advantage offered by measuring lensing in the radio band is the polarization information which is usually measured in addition to the total intensity in radio surveys .",
    "previous authors have exploited the fact that the polarization position angle is unaffected by lensing in order to measure gravitational lensing of distant quasars @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we showed how one could extend this idea to measure cosmic shear .",
    "the technique relies on there existing a reasonably tight relationship between the orientation of the integrated polarized emission and the intrinsic morphological orientation of the galaxy .",
    "the existence of this relationship needs to be established for the high - redshift star - forming galaxies which are expected to dominate the radio sky at the @xmath2jy flux sensitivities achievable with forthcoming instruments .",
    "however , such a relationship certainly exists in the local universe @xcite and it is reasonable to assume that it persists to higher redshift .",
    "a key difference between the polarization technique and standard techniques for measuring lensing is that the former _ does not _ assume that the ensemble average of the intrinsic shapes of galaxies vanishes .",
    "it is thus , in principle , able to cleanly discriminate between a lensing signal and a possible contaminating signal due to intrinsic galaxy alignments @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate the direct reconstruction of the projected dark matter distribution ( or lensing convergence field ) using the radio polarization technique .",
    "our simulations are based on the ray - tracing simulations of @xcite .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : sim ] by summarizing the salient features of these simulations and we describe the parameters we have adopted to mimic the e - merlin ( currently being commissioned with full operation planned for the second half of 2011 ) and ska instruments . in section  [ sec : method ] , we describe how to include polarization information in a direct - inversion mass reconstruction algorithm and we present our simulation results .",
    "we finish in section  [ sec : discuss ] with a discussion .",
    "to demonstrate the mass reconstruction technique using polarization information , we have made use of the simulated lensing convergence and shear maps of @xcite .",
    "these simulations comprise @xmath3 square degrees of simulated sky from high resolution numerical simulations based on a @xmath4cdm cosmology with parameters , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the simulations consist of 112 @xmath9 deg@xmath1 fields which are approximately independent .",
    "the assumed redshift distribution is of the form , @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the median redshift of this distribution is @xmath13 . making use of the semi - empirical ska design studies ( skads ) simulation of @xcite",
    ", we have checked that this @xmath14 agrees reasonably well with the redshift distribution of star - forming galaxies expected in future deep radio surveys . in particular , we measure @xmath15 in the skads simulation for a @xmath16 detection threshold of @xmath17 @xmath2jy , a sensitivity which could be reached over 1.75 deg@xmath1 using e - merlin .",
    "large - scale surveys with the ska might go @xmath18 times deeper ( e.g.  @xcite ) . at this depth , we measure a median redshift of @xmath19 from the skads simulation . although the predicted median redshift of the proposed e - merlin survey is somewhat smaller than that of white s simulations , this discrepancy is sub - dominant when compared to the current very large uncertainties in predicting @xmath14 for @xmath2jy - sensitivity radio surveys .",
    "a further unknown for forthcoming radio surveys is the number density of galaxies that will be achieved .",
    "source counts at 1.4  ghz are presented in @xcite for deep fields over relatively small areas of sky .",
    "extrapolating from this study suggests a source density of @xmath20 arcmin@xmath21 for a detection threshold of @xmath17 @xmath2jy .",
    "this source density is also consistent with that found in deep vla + merlin observations of the hubble deep field @xcite .",
    "the source counts from a more recent study by @xcite are significantly higher and suggest a source density of @xmath22 arcmin@xmath21 could be achieved . for the e - merlin simulations",
    ", we take the average of these two estimates and adopt @xmath23 arcmin@xmath21 for the number density of galaxies detected in total intensity . for the ska simulations , we assume @xmath24 arcmin@xmath21 .    the polarization properties of the high - redshift star - forming galaxies which will dominate these surveys are currently unknown .",
    "we can only extrapolate from the local universe where the fractional polarization is typically between @xmath25 and @xmath26% @xcite .",
    "these observations of local galaxies also suggest that the polarized emission and the morphological orientation are well aligned to an accuracy of between @xmath25 and @xmath27 degs .    for our simulations , we assume that the galaxies are , on average , 10% polarized . noting that a measurement of the orientation of the polarized emission requires only a third of the sensitivity which would be required to measure the shape of the emission , we assume further that we can measure a useful polarization orientation for one third of the galaxies detected in total intensity .",
    "thus , we assume @xmath28 arcmin@xmath21 for e - merlin and @xmath29 arcmin@xmath21 for the ska .",
    "we further assume that such polarization orientation detections are an unbiased tracer of the intrinsic morphological orientation of the galaxy with a scatter of @xmath30 degs .",
    "( see section 2 of @xcite for further discussion on the current observational status for polarization and possible values for these parameters . )    to mimic the proposed e - merlin survey , we extract the central 1.75 deg@xmath1 from each @xmath31 deg@xmath1 simulation .",
    "an example of the convergence distribution for one field is shown in the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dm_maps ] where a number of large - scale structures and filaments are clearly visible . using the parameters detailed above",
    ", we generate background galaxies randomly distributed across the field of view .",
    "each galaxy is assigned an intrinsic ellipticity , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are drawn from zero - mean gaussian distributions with width @xmath35 .",
    "for each galaxy , we then add the simulated shear to the intrinsic ellipticity , interpolating the shear from the numerical simulations .    for the polarization technique",
    ", we additionally simulate the observed orientation of the polarized emission of each galaxy according to @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the intrinsic position angle of the galaxy and @xmath38 is the random noise in the polarized orientation  intrinsic position angle relationship .",
    "to reconstruct the convergence field from the simulated galaxy catalogues , we use a variant of the kaiser - squires direct - inversion technique ( @xcite ) .",
    "our implementation is similar to the real - space algorithm described in @xcite . to perform the reconstruction using the total intensity only ( i.e.  using the standard lensing technique ) , following @xcite , we first estimate the mean shear field on a regular grid covering the entire field .",
    "we estimate the shear in each grid cell as ( the indexes , \\{i , j } denote the grid cells ) _",
    "i , j = where the sum is over all galaxies and we have applied a weight of w_k = ( - ) [ eqn : weights ] to each of the observed ellipticities , @xmath39 . we use a smoothing scale of @xmath40 arcmin . the convergence field",
    "is then estimated as a convolution , ( ) = - _ i , j [ ( - _ i , j ) ^*(_i , j ) ] [ eqn : kappa_est ] where the kernel , @xmath41 is given by = .",
    "including the polarization information in this estimator is straightforward and simply involves using a weighted version of the shear estimator described in @xcite to estimate the shear at each grid point .",
    "explicitly , the shear in each grid cell is now estimated as = ^-1 , [ eqn : new_est ] where the matrix , @xmath42 , and the vector , @xmath43 , are given by & = & _ k w_k^ _ k^ _ k^t , [ eqn : amatrix_def ] + & = & _ k w_k ( _ k^obs _ k ) _ k. [ eqn : bvec_def ] here , @xmath44 is the direction at @xmath45 to the estimate of the intrinsic position angle of the galaxy as provided by the polarization and @xmath46 is a weight .",
    "using a weighting scheme in equation  ( [ eqn : new_est ] ) is now crucial  the small galaxy number density we are dealing with means that `` shot noise '' is a severe problem for the polarization estimator .",
    "had we used an unweighted shear estimator ( i.e. simple binning ) then a significant fraction of our grid cells would contain no galaxies for the polarization estimator and this would present problems for the convolution operation . by using weights which are non - negligible at the typical separation of polarized galaxies , we can recover the shear at each point in the grid , albeit at the expense of a smoothing of the shear field . in practice",
    ", we use the same weighting scheme as for the standard case ( equation  [ eqn : weights ] ) with the same smoothing scale , @xmath47 arcmin , in all cases . once the shear field has been estimated , the convergence , @xmath48 is found as in the standard case ( equation  [ eqn : kappa_est ] ) .",
    "an example of the mass reconstruction performance for both the standard estimator and the polarization estimator is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dm_maps ] .",
    "the simulated e - merlin reconstructions have been performed on a @xmath49 grid of 1.25 arcmin pixels . for the much higher fidelity ska simulations , we use a @xmath50 grid of 0.625 arcmin pixels .",
    "we see that the major mass concentrations can be successfully identified in the simulated e - merlin reconstructions while the ska maps also trace the filamentary structure of the numerical simulations extremely well . for the observational parameters we have adopted , the reconstructions obtained using",
    "the polarization estimator are of similar sensitivity to those obtained using the standard estimator . in table",
    "[ tab : rms_noise ] we list the reconstructed convergence field integrated in apertures of radius 3 arcmin for the two largest structures in the field , centred on @xmath51 arcmin and @xmath52 arcmin .",
    "the errors are determined by repeating the analysis on empty fields and measuring the root - mean - square convergence field integrated in identical apertures .",
    "c c c e - merlin : & & + cluster 1 & @xmath53 & @xmath54 + cluster 2 & @xmath55 & @xmath56 +   + ska : & & + cluster 1 & @xmath57 & @xmath58 + cluster 2 & @xmath59 & @xmath60 [ tab : rms_noise ]    we have also measured the shear correlation functions from the simulated maps .",
    "the correlation functions are defined as c_1 ( ) & = & _ 1^r()_1^r(+ ) + c_2 ( ) & = & _ 2^r()_2^r(+ ) + c_3 ( ) & = & _ 1^r()_2^r(+ ) where the angled brackets denote an average over all map - pixel pairs separated by @xmath61 and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the estimated shear components rotated to a coordinate system aligned with the vector joining the two map - pixels .",
    "the cross - correlation , @xmath64 is expected to vanish in the absence of parity - violating effects .",
    "we have measured the total correlation function , @xmath65 using both the standard and polarization estimator and have also combined the results from the two techniques .",
    "note that the combination of the two estimators is powerful since the dominant source of measurement noise is different in the two cases  for the standard estimator , the shape noise dominates while for the polarization estimator the noise associated with @xmath66 dominates meaning that there is useful extra information in the cross - correlation of the shear fields estimated using the two techniques .",
    "the cross - correlation can also be useful in mitigating systematics which would likely be different for the two techniques .",
    "the results , averaged over simulations , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ctheta ] .",
    "naively , it looks as though a detection of cosmic shear is possible with the proposed 1.75 deg@xmath1 e - merlin survey .",
    "however , the measurements on different scales are strongly correlated and the formal detection significance is only @xmath67 .",
    "note that the dominant contribution to the errors is sample variance . instead of doing cosmology ,",
    "if we ask the question how well can we measure the lensing signal in a typical 1.75 deg@xmath1 field , then the significance is much larger ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "in this letter , we have extended the techniques of @xcite to the lensing reconstruction of dark matter maps from polarized radio surveys . for the parameters which we have adopted",
    ", the technique looks extremely promising and could make future radio surveys as powerful as optical lensing surveys containing many more galaxies .",
    "there is , of course , a great deal of uncertainty with respect to the values one should adopt for the polarization properties of star - forming galaxies at @xmath2jy flux densities . in particular , the typical fractional polarization and the degree to which the orientation of the polarized emission is aligned with the intrinsic morphological orientation are currently unknown .",
    "we note also however that there is a trade - off in these two parameters .",
    "for example , one can imagine including a larger number of galaxies whose polarized emission and intrinsic orientation are poorly aligned ( large @xmath69 and large @xmath66 ) or one could be very selective about which galaxies one includes , choosing high fractional polarization objects whose polarization orientation closely traces the major axis of the galaxy ( low @xmath69 and low @xmath70 ) .    in terms of forecasting constraints for future surveys",
    ", @xcite has shown that the errors obtainable on the shear power spectrum with a survey covering a fraction of sky @xmath71 and with a galaxy number density @xmath72 are given by c_= ( c_+ ) .",
    "the equivalent expression for the polarization case is c_= ( c_+ ) .",
    "[ eqn : cls_forecast_pol ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : cls ] , we have plotted these predictions for some representative numbers chosen to mimic large - scale surveys to be conducted with the ska .",
    "if the polarization properties of star - forming galaxies assumed here turn out to be reasonable , then it will be very interesting to apply the polarization techniques described here and elsewhere to forthcoming high - resolution @xmath2jy - sensitivity radio surveys ."
