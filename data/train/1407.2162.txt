    "observable phenomena include magnetic field effects@xcite and magnetic isotope effects@xcite on chemical reactivity , and the production of large electron@xcite and nuclear@xcite spin hyperpolarizations  effects that collectively constitute the field of spin chemistry.@xcite the most intensively studied entities that exhibit these behaviours are the radical pairs that are formed as transient intermediates in thermal and photochemical reactions in condensed phases .    provided spin - orbit coupling is weak , pairs of radicals are created , for example by bond fission or electron transfer , in the same overall electronic spin state ( singlet or triplet ) as their chemical precursors .",
    "however , the spin eigenstates of radical pairs are normally neither singlet nor triplet because of the symmetry - breaking that arises from electron - nuclear hyperfine and/or zeeman interactions . as a result ,",
    "radical pairs form in superposition states which evolve coherently at frequencies determined by the internal and external magnetic interactions of the radicals .",
    "these interactions determine the time - dependent probability that a radical pair is singlet or triplet and therefore influence both the yields of spin - selective reactions and the lifetime of the radical pair itself if the competing singlet and triplet reaction pathways have different rate constants .",
    "radical recombination and spin relaxation can be slow enough to allow even an earth - strength magnetic field ( @xmath2 @xmath3 t ) to have a measurable effect via the electron zeeman interaction ( @xmath4 @xmath5 at 300 k).@xcite    the theory of the radical pair mechanism is well developed and in principle capable of exact quantitative interpretation of a wide variety of experimental data.@xcite in general one needs to treat the time - dependent quantum mechanics of the electron - nuclear spin system , including the relevant spin interactions ( zeeman , hyperfine , dipolar , exchange , quadrupolar , @xmath6 ) , chemical reaction steps , spin relaxation pathways , molecular motions , and so on .",
    "a major difficulty encountered in such calculations , however , is that they scale exponentially with the number of nuclear spins , @xmath7 , and it is rarely possible to perform exact quantum simulations for @xmath7 greater than about 10 .",
    "unfortunately , organic radicals often have more than 10 nuclei with significant hyperfine couplings , especially when the molecular orbital that contains the unpaired electron is delocalised as in the case of extended @xmath8-systems .",
    "the problem becomes particularly acute for biological radical pairs , for example those formed naturally in photosynthetic reaction centre proteins during the initial steps of solar energy conversion@xcite and those thought to act as the magnetic compass sensors in cryptochrome proteins in the avian retina.@xcite    a potential solution to the exponential scaling problem was put forward by schulten and wolynes ( sw ) in the early days of spin chemistry.@xcite they modelled the electron spin motion induced by hyperfine coupling to many nuclear spins by means of a semiclassical ( sc ) approximation in which the electron spin precesses around a hyperfine - weighted sum of nuclear spin vectors , assumed to be fixed in space .",
    "although successful in some circumstances,@xcite this approach conflicts with newton s third law of motion , because the torque exerted on the electron spin by the nuclear spins is not balanced by an equal and opposite torque on the nuclear spins from the electron .",
    "our recent extension to the sw theory@xcite eliminates this inconsistency by allowing each individual nuclear spin in the radical to precess around the electron spin .",
    "the resulting sc theory approaches quantitative agreement with quantum mechanics as @xmath7 increases , reproduces the correct behaviour of long - lived radical pairs in applied magnetic fields , scales linearly with @xmath7 and so is applicable to arbitrarily large radicals , and is faster than the exact quantum mechanical ( qm ) calculation for @xmath9.@xcite    both sc approaches@xcite are applicable to the case in which the rate constants for the spin - selective reactions of singlet and triplet radical pairs are identical .",
    "this has been a popular simplifying assumption in the past,@xcite but it is rarely realistic . for solution - phase reactions , for example ,",
    "singlet radical pairs often react to form diamagnetic products in a diffusion - controlled manner while the corresponding triplets are unreactive because of the absence of low - energy triplet product states .",
    "even when spin - allowed singlet and triplet reaction routes coexist , their rate constants are rarely identical , for example because singlet and triplet electron transfers have different thermodynamic driving forces.@xcite    here we generalise our earlier sc theory@xcite to allow for asymmetric recombination . to do this , we consider the complete set of 16 two - electron spin operators of the radical pair as independent classical variables . having validated this approach against the exact quantum mechanical results for a model radical pair with @xmath10 spin-@xmath11 nuclei , we use it to account for the experimentally observed effects of earth - strength magnetic fields ( 39 and 49 @xmath3 t ) on the lifetime of a radical pair containing @xmath12 protons.@xcite",

    ", there are two rapid ( sub nanosecond ) electron transfers , first from the excited state of the porphyrin to the fullerene ( a well - established electron acceptor ) , and then from the carotenoid to the porphyrin.@xcite these electron transfers result in a c@xmath176pf@xmath177 radical pair which is believed to be formed predominantly in its singlet state.@xcite the radical pair then undergoes coherent electron spin evolution to the triplet state while the singlet and triplet components recombine at different rates , in accordance with the asymmetric recombination scheme we have been considering throughout this paper .",
    "a convenient experimental probe of the recombination dynamics is provided by the transient absorption signal of the carotenoid radical at time @xmath49 after the initial photo - excitation laser pulse.@xcite since this radical is present in both the singlet and triplet states of the photo - excited triad , and disappears on recombination , its absorption is proportional to the total survival probability @xmath174 of the radical pair .",
    "of particular interest from the point of view of the chemical compass is how the applied magnetic field @xmath178 affects this survival probability , which is encapsulated in the magnetic field effect @xmath173 .",
    "this can be accessed experimentally by measuring the transient absorption of the carotenoid radical in the presence and the absence of the applied field.@xcite note that , if the recombination were symmetric , @xmath35 , one would have @xmath179 for all @xmath178 , so there would be no magnetic field effect .",
    "the success of this experiment therefore rests entirely on the asymmetry of the recombination process .    in their pioneering paper , maeda _ et al._@xcite performed a number of experiments of this form on the cpf triad , under different physical conditions and with different magnetic field strengths . by dissolving the molecule in a nematic liquid crystal",
    "so as to obtain an aligned sample that could be probed directly , and separately applying a transient absorption photoselection technique to a frozen solution of randomly oriented molecules , they were able to measure the anisotropy of the magnetic field effect on the disappearance kinetics of the radical pair , and thereby demonstrate the potential of the triad to behave as a compass.@xcite unfortunately , the sensitivity of these measurements was not sufficient to detect any anisotropy in the earth s magnetic field ( @xmath2 @xmath3 t ) , so higher fields ( @xmath180 mt ) were used instead .",
    "the fact that the cpf triad _ is _ capable of detecting an earth - strength magnetic field was demonstrated in a separate transient absorption experiment , using a sample in solution at 113 k with magnetic fields of @xmath181 and @xmath182 @xmath3t.@xcite a number of more refined experiments are currently underway in oxford using the same triad and related variants , but it is this original demonstration that a radical pair recombination reaction is capable of detecting the earth s magnetic field that we shall focus on .    to use our sc theory to shed light on this experimental observation , we shall clearly need to know the isotropic hyperfine coupling constants of the nuclear spins in the c@xmath0pf@xmath1 radical pair , and we ought also to consider the effect of electron spin relaxation , which will almost certainly have a bearing on experimental measurements of the triad in solution . in what follows , we shall adopt the simplest possible approaches to these two problems , leaving refinements to future work .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "8 shows that the carotenoid in the triad contains 45 hydrogen nuclei , and that the porphyrin linker contains a number of hydrogens and nitrogens .",
    "discounting @xmath183c nuclei , which will be distributed randomly in the molecule with a @xmath1841% natural abundance , these are the only magnetic nuclei that are present .",
    "the simplest approach is therefore to assume that the hyperfine interactions between the unpaired electrons in the two radicals and the magnetic nuclei on the porphyrin linker can be neglected , to treat the carotenoid radical as having 45 @xmath156 nuclear spins , and the fullerene radical as having none .",
    "this reduces the spin problem to a form that is identical to the model problem with 12 @xmath156 nuclear spins we have considered above , but with more nuclear spins than would be manageable in an exact quantum mechanical calculation .",
    "the isotropic fermi contact couplings of the 46 protons in the carotenoid cation ( @xmath185ch@xmath0 ) have been calculated by kuprov using unrestricted b3lyp@xcite density functional theory with a hyperfine - optimised epr - ii@xcite orbital basis set , and we have used the 45 of these 46 coupling constants that pertain to the protons in the carotenoid radical of the cpf triad in our calculations.@xcite ( one might question whether terminating the carotenoid cation with a covalently - bonded hydrogen atom provides a reasonable approximation to the corresponding radical in the photo - excited cpf triad . however , this closure does at least ensure that the electron hole resides entirely on the carotenoid , which is consistent with our treatment of the electron spin dynamics . when one attempts a more sophisticated closure , such as including the porphyrin linker before closing things off with a covalently - bonded hydrogen atom , one runs into the self - interaction problem of density functional theory , which leads to excessive delocalisation of the unpaired electron density onto the closing group .",
    "the b3lyp functional contains a fraction of exact exchange that reduces this problem , but there is no guarantee that it will suppress the delocalisation correctly in every situation , and in the present context it has been shown not to.@xcite in any event , to make our spin dynamics calculations reproducible , we have listed all 45 of the hyperfine coupling constants that we actually used for the carotenoid radical in the appendix . )    this leaves electron spin relaxation , which will clearly have an influence on measurements of the cpf triad in solution where the anisotropic ( dipolar ) hyperfine interactions in the carotenoid radical will be modulated by molecular tumbling motion . to include this effect , we shall assume that the coupling between the unpaired electrons in the radical pair is sufficiently weak to exclude concerted processes , and treat the two electrons as relaxing independently .",
    "this can be done in a phenomenological way in the sc theory simply by adding the following terms to the equations of motion in eqs .",
    "( 28)-(30 ) : @xmath186 @xmath187 @xmath188 here the dots ( @xmath189 ) denote the electron spin evolution and recombination terms that are already present in the equations and @xmath190 is a relaxation matrix for the electron spin on radical @xmath20 .",
    "note that these additional terms cause @xmath191 to relax at a rate @xmath192 , @xmath193 to relax at a rate @xmath194 , and @xmath195 to relax at a rate @xmath196 .",
    "note also that the relaxation reduces the magnitude of @xmath111 $ ] , which transfers probability between @xmath197 $ ] and @xmath198 $ ] and would bring both to their equilibrium values @xmath199 and @xmath200 in the absence of any recombination . and note finally that , since the equation of motion for @xmath126 in eq .",
    "( 31 ) is unchanged , eq .  ( 39 ) continues to hold and the sum rule constraint in eq .",
    "( 40 ) is unaffected by the relaxation .",
    "all of this is physically correct .",
    "the inclusion of electron spin relaxation using eqs .",
    "( 41)(44 ) introduces four new parameters , the longitudinal ( @xmath201 ) and transverse ( @xmath202 ) relaxation times of the electrons in the two radicals .",
    "however , for the cpf triad in an earth - strength magnetic field , we can use the physics of the problem to reduce these four parameters to just one .",
    "since the earth s magnetic field is so weak , the electron spin relaxation along the field ( @xmath203 ) axis will be hardly any different from that along the @xmath204 and @xmath205 axes , so we can make the approximation that @xmath206 . and",
    "since the mechanism of the electron spin relaxation is the modulation of its hyperfine interactions by the tumbling motion in solution , and the fullerene radical ( let us call it 2 ) in the triad has no hyperfine interactions , we can make the further approximation that @xmath207 .",
    "with these simplifications , the only remaining parameter is the relaxation rate @xmath208 of the electron spin on the carotenoid radical .",
    "moreover this is the _ only _ adjustable parameter that we shall need to include in our calculations .",
    "we shall also clearly need to know the singlet and triplet recombination rates @xmath14 and @xmath15 of the radical pair , but these have been determined experimentally.@xcite by fitting a simple kinetic model to the decays recorded in pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) measurements of the triad at 110 k , maeda _",
    "et al._@xcite have established that @xmath209 s@xmath168 and @xmath210 s@xmath168 , and that the fraction of the triplet in the initial state of the c@xmath0pf@xmath1 radical pair is @xmath211 . in what follows",
    ", we shall take all three of these numbers as given , and assume that they apply equally well to the earlier experiment in an earth - strength magnetic field at 113 k.@xcite the small initial fraction of the triplet state in the radical pair can be included in the sc theory by replacing @xmath212 in eqs .",
    "( 35 ) and  ( 36 ) with @xmath213 which populates all three components of the triplet equally at time @xmath13 .",
    "this is consistent with the kinetic model that maeda _ et al .",
    "_ used to interpret their pulsed epr data.@xcite    with all of these preliminaries in hand , we are finally in a position to compare the computed sc magnetic field effect on the survival probability of the c@xmath0pf@xmath1 radical pair with the experimental measurements of maeda _",
    "et al._@xcite this comparison is shown for an optimised carotenoid radical relaxation rate of @xmath214 s@xmath168 in fig .",
    "9 . by tuning just this one free parameter",
    ", one sees that the sc theory can be brought into almost quantitative agreement with the experiment .",
    "the experimental signal is reproduced equally well at both field strengths , both in terms of its time scale ( which was obtained using the gyromagnetic ratio of a free electron in the sc calculations , @xmath215 @xmath3s@xmath168 mt@xmath168 ) and of the relative amplitudes of its positive and negative peaks .",
    "furthermore , the magnitude of the sc magnetic field effect is also roughly correct . in the 49 @xmath3",
    "t experimental data , the difference signal @xmath216 is @xmath217% of the field - free carotenoid absorption signal @xmath218 at 0.7 @xmath3s,@xcite and in our sc calculations @xmath219 is @xmath217% of @xmath220 at 0.65 @xmath3s , which allows for the @xmath2 ns experimental instrumental delay .",
    "the dependence of the sc results on the relaxation rate @xmath221 of the electron spin on the carotenoid radical is illustrated for the case of a 49 @xmath3 t applied field in fig .",
    "the magnitude and the time scale of the computed magnetic field effect both decrease as the electron spin relaxation rate increases , as one would expect .",
    "this monotonic behaviour makes it straightforward to determine the @xmath221 that gives the best fit to the experimental data , and the sensitivity of the results to @xmath221 fixes the optimum value quite precisely : neither @xmath222 s@xmath168 nor @xmath223 s@xmath168 gives quite such good agreement with the experimental signals at both magnetic field strengths as the sc calculation with @xmath224 s@xmath168 .",
    "the most intriguing aspect of the experimental results is the biphasic nature of the time signal .",
    "this has been the subject of some debate .",
    "an exotic early explanation based on quantum measurement theory invoked the quantum zeno effect under the assumption that @xmath225.@xcite however , this has since been ruled out by the pulsed epr measurements of maeda _",
    "et al._,@xcite which clearly show that @xmath226 .",
    "in fact , it is easy to see from this ( and the predominantly singlet initial state ) why a weak magnetic field enhances the survival probability of the radical pair at short times .",
    "this is the standard low field effect:@xcite a small applied field breaks the symmetry of the zero - field problem and splits the degeneracy of the zero - field eigenstates , producing more pathways for singlet to triplet interconversion . applying the field therefore converts more of the predominantly singlet initial state into the triplet state , where it recombines more slowly when @xmath226 thereby increasing the survival probability of the radical pair .",
    "what is harder to understand is why the applied field decreases the survival probability at longer times .",
    "et al._@xcite have provided an explanation for this based on a combination of the small initial population of the triplet state and relaxation - induced population flow between the t@xmath227 triplet components and the s and t@xmath228 states in the high - field limit , which they backed up with a simplified quantum mechanical calculation involving just two effective hyperfine interactions in a magnetic field of 1.28 mt . however , the experimental results in fig .",
    "9 are far from the high - field limit , and the present sc calculations which reproduce these results suggest that the low - field situation is significantly more complicated .    the most compelling evidence we have found for this is presented in fig .  11 .",
    "if it were true that the biphasic behaviour of the experimental signal resulted solely from relaxation - induced population flow between the t@xmath227 and s and t@xmath228 states , one would not expect it to make any difference whether the relaxation were of the electron spin on the carotenoid , the electron spin on the fullerene , or both ( the last of these possibilities being the one considered in maeda _ et al . _",
    "s calculation@xcite ) .",
    "the population transfer between the singlet and triplet states of the radical pair operates in the same way regardless of which electron spin it is that is relaxing .",
    "11 shows that the sc results are however strongly dependent on the details of the electron spin relaxation .",
    "the negative peak in @xmath173 that is seen when the relaxation is confined to the carotenoid electron is significantly damped when both electrons relax at half the rate , and washed out almost completely when all of the relaxation is transferred to the fullerene electron . yet the equation of motion for @xmath112 in eq .",
    "( 43 ) , which governs the transfer of population between @xmath197 $ ] and @xmath198 $ ] , is exactly the same in all three cases .",
    "what does change is the dynamics of the individual electron spins , and evidently the biphasic behaviour is only captured correctly ( with @xmath224 s@xmath168 ) when it is the electron spin on the carotenoid that relaxes .",
    "( the biphasic behaviour can be restored in the other two scenarios by reducing @xmath221 , but then its time scale becomes too long to match the experiment . )",
    "the upshot is that the sc simulation can only be brought into agreement with the experiment in the physically realistic scenario in which it is the electron spin on the carotenoid radical that relaxes ( recall that discounting any @xmath183c s that may be present the fullerene radical does not have any nuclear spins available to relax its electron spin via dipolar coupling ) .    we conclude that the biphasic behaviour of the experimental signal arises from a delicate balance between the asymmetric recombination of the radical pair ( with @xmath229 s@xmath230 ) and the relaxation of the electron spin on the carotenoid radical ( with @xmath214 s@xmath168 ) .",
    "this balance is too subtle to be captured correctly by a back - of - the - envelope calculation , at least in an earth - strength magnetic field where the zeeman and hyperfine interactions in the carotenoid radical are comparable and there is no obvious simplification that can be made to its spin dynamics .",
    "however , it has emerged as the only plausible way to explain the experimental data from our sc calculations , which we would expect on the basis of figs .",
    "4 - 7 to be quite reliable for a radical pair of the size of the c@xmath0pf@xmath1 triad .",
    "the only remaining question is whether the relaxation rate of @xmath214 s@xmath168 that we have obtained for the electron spin on the carotenoid radical is reasonable . in their fit to the effect of a larger ( 1.28 mt ) magnetic field on the survival probability of the same triad at 110 k , which used a simplified model with just two effective hyperfine interactions and assumed equal relaxation rates for both electron spins , maeda _ et al._@xcite obtained a value of @xmath231 s@xmath168 , a full order of magnitude smaller than our relaxation rate .",
    "however , since this was for two electron spins rather than one , we should double it for a fairer comparison of its effect on the rate of transfer of population between the singlet and triplet states of the radical pair .",
    "then the difference is only a factor of 5 . given that the experimental data used in the two fits was measured at different magnetic field strengths ( @xmath232 @xmath3 t and 1.28 mt ) and temperatures ( 113 k and 110 k ) , that both of these temperatures are very close to the @xmath233 k melting point of the 2-methyltetrahydrofuran solvent that was used in the experiments , and that maeda _",
    "_ were able to use a far cruder theoretical model to fit their high - field data , we do not find this factor of 5 at all unreasonable .",
    "in this paper , we have generalised our earlier sc theory of radical pair recombination reactions@xcite to allow for asymmetric recombination of the radical pair and relaxation of its electron spins .",
    "the resulting theory has been validated by comparison with exact qm results for a model radical pair containing 12 nuclear spins ( see figs .  4 to  7 ) , and then applied to a carotenoid - porphyrin - fullerene triad for which the exact qm calculation would be quite impractical ( see figs .  8 to  11 ) .",
    "this application has shed light on the response of the photo - excited c@xmath0pf@xmath1 triad to an earth - strength magnetic field , suggesting in particular that the experimentally observed response arises from a delicate balance between the asymmetric recombination of the radical pair and the relaxation of the electron spin on the carotenoid radical .",
    "this clearly establishes the sc theory as a practical way to solve problems in spin chemistry . before it can be used more widely , however , we shall first have to generalise it to include a number of other effects that are often relevant , such as anisotropic hyperfine interactions , exchange and dipolar couplings between the two electrons in the radical pair , and interactions with radiofrequency radiation .",
    "the present extension of the theory to the two - electron spin variables in eqs .",
    "( 28 ) to  ( 37 ) paves the way for these additional generalisations , which we expect to be comparatively straightforward .",
    "once they have been incorporated , the sc theory promises to provide a universal tool for analysing spin chemistry problems that are too complicated to study quantum mechanically .",
    "we would like to thank christiane timmel for helpful discussions , ilya kuprov for providing us with the hyperfine coupling constants of the carotenoid radical , and martin galpin for spotting the key step in the argument in eq .",
    "this work was supported by the defence advanced research projects agency ( qube : n66001 - 10 - 1 - 4061 ) and the european research council ( pjh ) , and by the wolfson foundation and the royal society ( dem ) .",
