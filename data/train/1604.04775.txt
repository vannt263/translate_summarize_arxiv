    "pascal s triangle is constructed from binomial coefficients @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the @xmath4 entry of the @xmath5 row ( see figure [ pastri ] ) .",
    "it is well - known that pascal s triangle exhibits a fractal nature mod @xmath0 where @xmath0 is a prime . for example , in the mod 2 case , the triangle follows the pattern of sierpinski s fractal , the fractal which begins with a triangle and removes the center quarter , doing the same for each remaining upright triangle at each iteration , as in figure [ sieriter ] .",
    "@xmath6        one can correlate each iteration of sierpinski s fractal to the first @xmath7 rows of pascal s triangle mod 2 , where the `` removed '' portion is all the zeros mod 2 , that is , all the even numbers .",
    "the first 8 rows of this triangle , corresponding to the second iteration of sierpinski s fractal , are shown in figure [ pascal2 ] .",
    "@xmath8    beyond @xmath9 , the exact fractal produced mod @xmath0 is different than sierpinski s , but exhibits the same repetitive structure .",
    "this structure can be described mathematically by expressing @xmath10 and @xmath11 in base @xmath0 .",

    "then    @xmath21    we have reproduced theorem [ lucas ] as it appears in @xcite . a proof of the theorem can be found in @xcite .",
    "what the theorem essentially means is that the exact residue class of any binomial coefficient mod @xmath0 can be determined by considering only binomials in the first @xmath0 rows of pascal s triangle , since the @xmath22 are between 0 and @xmath23 .",
    "binomial coefficients can be generalized to produce other triangles , which may also be studied mod @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we will specifically study the fibonomial triangle , which is constructed from the fibonacci sequence .",
    "let @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 ,",
    "so that @xmath27 is the fibonacci sequence @xmath28 there are many combinatorial interpretations of these numbers ; for example , @xmath29 counts the number of ways to tile a row of @xmath30 tiles with dominos and squares ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we will use this result in a later proof .",
    "the sequence also appears in various places throughout nature , such as in pinecone spirals and the unencumbered growth of rabbit populations .",

    ". it would be reasonable to suspect that @xmath41 has a combinatorial interpretation , and in fact it does . given a @xmath42 board with a lattice path @xmath43 running from the lower left corner to the upper right corner , @xmath41 counts the number of ways over all possible paths @xmath43 to tile the rows above @xmath43 with dominos and squares while tiling the columns below @xmath43 with tilings of dominos and squares , with the added proviso that each column must have a domino in its first two ( lowest ) tiles . a proof of this fact is given in @xcite .",

    "in contrast to these cases , if @xmath68 , it appears that divisibility by @xmath0 is maintained .",

    "chen and sagan s primary method of proof is combinatorial .",

    "@xmath82    we will make use of methods similar to chen and sagan s number theoretic proof of theorem [ chesagmain ] .",

    "as noted in the introduction , since @xmath88 , this shows conjecture [ openprob ] for when @xmath9 .",
    "chen and sagan prove their theorem with a case - by - case analysis of the congruence classes of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , relying on a theorem of knuth and wilf involving the @xmath0-adic valuation of @xmath41 .",

    "knuth and wilf @xcite study generalized binomial coefficients and derive conditions for when the prime @xmath0 divides @xmath41 .",

    "these definitions give us enough information to state the pertinent theorem of knuth and wilf :    [ knuwil ] the highest power of the odd prime @xmath0 that divides the fibonomial coefficient @xmath94 is the number of carries that occur to the left of the radix point when @xmath95 is added to @xmath96 in @xmath0-ary notation , plus @xmath97 if a carry occurs across the radix point .",
    "for example , when @xmath18 , we have @xmath98 since @xmath99 is the first fibonacci number which 7 divides .",

    ", we have @xmath102 and @xmath103 . to divide by 8 in base 7",
    ", we must express 8 as @xmath104 , which gives @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "then adding gives    @xmath107    where one carry occurs across the radix point and one carry occurs from the 1 s place to the 7 s place .",
    "thus by theorem [ knuwil ] , @xmath108 .",
    "we wish to use theorem [ knuwil ] to show that conjecture [ openprob ] holds when @xmath78 , as these methods illustrate how the conjecture might be proven in the case of a more general prime @xmath0 . for our purposes in the @xmath109 case",
    ", we need the fact that @xmath110 , since the first fibonacci number divisible by 5 is @xmath111",
    ". then @xmath112 . using this fact",
    ", we will prove the following corollary of knuth and wilf s theorem :    [ fiveval ] the highest power of 5 that divides the fibonomial coefficient @xmath94 is the number of carries that occur when @xmath113 is added to @xmath114 in 5-ary notation .",
    "break the carries down into three types : those occurring to the left of the radix point , a carry occurring across it , and those occurring to the right of the radix point .",
    "theorem [ knuwil ] simply counts the number of the first type of carry , as does this corollary . for a carry occurring across the radix point , theorem [ knuwil ]",
    "counts @xmath97 .",
    "but we have @xmath115 , so we can simply count whether or not this carry occurs .",
    "lastly , theorem [ knuwil ] does nt count carries to the right of the radix point .",
    "but no such carries occur for our corollary : since division by 5 in base 5 simply moves the radix point one space to the left ( identical to division by 10 in base 10 ) , the numbers @xmath113 and @xmath114 each terminate one place to the right of the radix point , thus eliminating the possibility of any carries further to the right of the radix point . so counting the total number of carries",
    "is identical to counting the number of carries described in theorem [ knuwil ] .",
    "@xmath116      to give necessary conditions for conjecture [ openprob ] , we will need several well - known facts about the divisibility of fibonacci numbers . among these",
    "are    @xmath117 and its corollary @xmath118 ,    as well as binet s formula , which denotes the distinct roots of @xmath119 as @xmath120 and @xmath121 , with the fact that    @xmath122 .",
    "we must also introduce the lucas numbers @xmath123 , which have the similar relation    @xmath124 .    in @xcite ,",
    "hoggatt and bergum make use of these facts to prove a theorem comparing the divisibility by @xmath0 of @xmath29 with that of @xmath125 :    [ berhog ] if @xmath0 is an odd prime and @xmath51 then @xmath126 for all @xmath127    we desire a slightly stronger result , namely , that the @xmath0-adic valuation increases by exactly 1 when the subscript of a fibonacci number divisible by @xmath0 is multipled by @xmath0 .",
    "this is in fact true , and we can generalize the proof of theorem [ berhog ] to prove the desired result :    [ valinc ] let @xmath0 be an odd prime .",

    "assume that @xmath130 for some positive @xmath11 .",
    "we wish to show that @xmath129 .",
    "using binet s formula , we have    @xmath131 .",
    "then by factoring @xmath132 , we arrive at    @xmath133    @xmath134 .    in the summation @xmath135 , the middle term is @xmath136 since @xmath137 . as in @xcite",
    "we can show that the sum of the @xmath138 and @xmath139 terms , where @xmath140 , is    @xmath141    @xmath142 .",
    "we follow @xcite in writing the subscript this way because of the relation    @xmath143    @xmath144 .",
    "thus we have that the sum of the two terms is    @xmath145    @xmath146 .",
    "grouping these terms together in the summation , we arrive at    @xmath147 .    now using our hypothesis that @xmath130 , let us inspect the term in parentheses .",
    "each fibonacci number in the summation has a subscript that @xmath10 divides , giving that @xmath29 divides each summand and hence @xmath148 divides each summand .",
    "but then the whole term takes the form @xmath149 , so only @xmath150 divides it , and no higher powers . hence @xmath151 .",
    "@xmath152    since we are concerned with the fibonomial triangle mod 5 , we have reproduced the first 10 rows of that triangle in figure [ fibtri5 ] . as noted in @xcite , divisibility by 5 of @xmath41",
    "is entirely understood , since the 5-adic valuation of a fibonacci number ( @xmath153 ) is the same as the 5-adic valuation of its subscript ( @xmath154 ) , and hence @xmath155 , since @xmath3 is obtained by replacing the fibonacci numbers in @xmath41 with their subscripts .",
    "thus by theorem [ lucas ] , conjecture [ openprob ] holds for @xmath78 .",
    "however , we will show this result using corollary [ fiveval ] , to illustrate how the result could be extended to more general primes .",
    "as observed previously , we have @xmath110 .",
    "thus the base @xmath156 is simply base 5 .",

    "thus @xmath164 , since no other multiples of five appear in the 25 positions in question . with that in mind",
    ", we proceed with the proof .",
    "@xmath165 by corollary [ fiveval ] , if @xmath166 then there is a carry occurring in the addition of @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "but as noted above , division by 5 in base 5 simply moves the radix point one point to the left , so this means there is a carry in the addition of @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "let the first carry occur at the @xmath171 position , that is , let the addition @xmath172 have a carry such that for @xmath173 has no carry .",
    "there are ten possibilities for @xmath174 , and @xmath175 , as shown in the table below :    @xmath176    each of these cases corresponds to a fibonomial @xmath177 that has @xmath178 .",

    "first , note that since @xmath179 , we have @xmath178 . thus @xmath177 is one of the 10 cases above , since those are the only cases where @xmath178 .",
    "then we can show that @xmath175 follows by minimality of @xmath183 .",
    "we are working with the following subtraction problem :    @xmath184    for each @xmath185 , since @xmath186 .",
    "then by definition , each @xmath161 has @xmath187 .",
    "so there is no carrying involved in calculating @xmath188 , which is exactly @xmath189 for each @xmath190 :    @xmath191    then @xmath175 is simply @xmath192 , where the 5 is carried from @xmath193 .",
    "this verifies that @xmath175 is as in the table above .",
    "but then a carry occurs in the addition of @xmath169 and @xmath170 , meaning a carry occurs in the addition of @xmath167 and @xmath168 , giving @xmath194    thus conjecture [ openprob ] holds when @xmath78 .",

    "<S> lastly , we conclude with a discussion concerning further directions of research . </S>"
