    "the fundamental nature of dark matter is at present unknown .",
    "it is widely believed that dark matter is in the form of a particle lying outside the ranks of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "an attractive possibility is that the new physics sector hosting the dark matter particle is connected to the electro - weak scale , soon to be explored with the large hadron collider .",
    "motivations in support of this possibility include the fact that several models for new , electro - weak scale physics encompass particles that have all the microscopic features necessary to be the dark matter ( this is the case for supersymmetry ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , models with universal extra - dimensions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , little higgs models ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and many others ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) ; in addition , weakly interacting particles with electro - weak scale mass ( or wimps , for weakly interacting massive particles ) possess the virtue that an order of magnitude estimate of their thermal relic abundance falls in the same range as the density of cold dark matter inferred from various cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "wimps might have once been in thermal equilibrium in the early universe , eventually freezing - out when the rate of pair - annihilation fell below the hubble expansion rate : particle dark matter , in this scenario , would be one more `` _ thermal relic _ '' , similar to the cosmic microwave background photons or the light elements produced during big bang nucleosynthesis .    the fact that , occasionally , wimps can still pair - annihilate in the present universe fostered a wide array of indirect particle dark matter searches : the pair annihilation of dark matter is expected to yield , for instance , a significant amount of energetic antimatter ( including gev positrons , antiprotons and antideuterons ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and gamma rays , from various radiative processes and from the decay of neutral pions resulting from the hadronization of particles in the pair - annihilation final state . of interest to us here",
    "is the fact that particle dark matter annihilation also produces a population of energetic electrons and positrons from , for instance , charged pion , muon , gauge and higgs boson decays , and , possibly , prompt production .",
    "the injection spectrum depends on the details of the particle dark matter model , but since electrons and positrons ( @xmath0 ) are produced at a center - of - mass energy corresponding to twice the particle dark matter mass , assumed here to be around the electro - weak scale , many of them will have energies at or above a gev .",
    "these energetic @xmath0 populate dark matter halos in any generic wimp model , with densities which depend on both the dark matter density profile and the wimp pair annihilation rate .",
    "electrons ( and positrons ) diffuse , loose energy and produce secondary radiation through various mechanisms . in the presence of magnetic fields they emit at radio wavelengths via synchrotron radiation .",
    "inverse compton ( ic ) scattering off target cosmic microwave background photons and background light at other frequencies gives rise to a broad spectrum of photons , stretching from the extreme ultra - violet up to the gamma - ray band . a further , typically subdominant contribution to secondary photon emission results from non - thermal bremsstrahlung , i.e. the emission of gamma - ray photons in the deflection of the charged particles by the electrostatic potential of intervening gas .",
    "the multi - wavelength emission from dark matter annihilation was studied in detail in the seminal works of @xcite for galactic dark matter clumps , in @xcite for the case of the coma cluster and in @xcite for the dwarf spheroidal galaxy draco .",
    "other recent studies include an interpretation of the significant non - thermal x - ray activity observed in the ophiuchus cluster in terms of ic scattering of dark - matter produced @xmath0 @xcite , an analysis of the broad - band dark - matter annihilation spectrum expected from the bullet cluster @xcite and from the galactic center region @xcite .",
    "in addition , radio emission from @xmath0 produced in dark matter annihilation was considered as a possible source for the `` wmap haze '' in the seminal paper of @xcite , and subsequently analyzed in detail in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "other studies have also previously addressed synchrotron radiation induced by dark matter annihilation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    among the possible targets for the observation of an astronomical signature of dark matter annihilation , local dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies stand out as excellent candidates for several reasons .",
    "first , unlike the galactic center region or galaxy clusters , no significant diffuse radio , x - ray or gamma - ray emission is expected : the gravitational potential well of dsph galaxies is too shallow for them to host any sizable thermal bremsstrahlung emission at x - ray frequencies , and , more importantly , the gas densities appear to be extremely low .",
    "second , dsph are the most dark matter dominated known systems , and , with the exception of our own milky way , they are the closest known bound dark matter systems . unlike a signal from the galactic center region or from a nearby cluster , a diffuse x - ray or radio emission from a nearby dsph galaxy would likely not have an obvious astrophysical counterpart that could fake a dark - matter induced emission . the cross correlation of diffuse emission from one of the nearby dsph galaxies with , for instance , point - like emission at gamma - ray frequencies detected with glast (",
    "unlike secondary emission from @xmath0 , species which undergo spatial diffusion , gamma rays trace the dark matter density profile squared ) , and a study of the spectral features at various wavelength could potentially lead not only to the conclusive detection of dark matter , but even to the identification of the particle mass and some of its microscopic particle properties .",
    "the spectral shape of the broad - band emission depends in fact on the dominant standard model final state into which the dark matter particle annihilates , and this is in turn determined by the wimp particle model .    in this paper , we present the first systematic study of archival x - ray data on local dsph galaxies with the aim of detecting a signal from dark matter annihilation . after introducing the physics of @xmath0 production from dark matter annihilation and of subsequent diffusion and energy loss , we present in sec .  [",
    "sec : multiw ] a few examples of multi - wavelength spectra , emphasizing and analyzing the role of systematic uncertainties connected with the dark matter particle model and with the diffusion setup .",
    "we then present our data reduction and analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] , motivating our choice for the energy range and angular region .",
    "we present limits on the x - ray diffuse emission from the dsph galaxies fornax , carina and ursa minor in sec .",
    "[ sec : xraylimt ] .",
    "[ sec : constraints ] is devoted to a study of how our null result limits particle dark matter models .",
    "our summary and a discussion of the role of future x - ray detectors in particle dark matter searches , including their connection with gamma - ray telescopes , are presented in the final sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the starting point for the computation of the multi - wavelength spectrum resulting from dark matter annihilation is the identification of the relevant source function . given a stable species @xmath1 and a position @xmath2 , the source function @xmath3 ( we are using here the same notation of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) gives the differential number of particles @xmath1 per unit time , energy and volume element produced at @xmath2 and with an energy @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the wimp pair annihilation rate at zero temperature , and the sum is over all kinematically allowed standard model annihilation final states @xmath7 ( for instance , quark - antiquark , @xmath8 , lepton - antilepton etc . ) , each weighed with a branching ratio @xmath9 and producing a spectral distribution @xmath10 , after prompt production or decay and fragmentation into the stable particle @xmath1 .",
    "finally , @xmath11 is the number of dark matter particle pairs per volume element squared , which for the case of a smooth dark matter distribution @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 where we indicate with @xmath14 the mass of the dark matter particle .    in the case of gamma rays , since photons propagate on straight lines , the flux from prompt emission in a given direction is simply given by the integral of the appropriate source function along the line of sight , @xmath15 the quantity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gr ] ) is then integrated over the angular region over which the signal is observed , and convolved with the angular dependent instrumental sensitivity of the gamma - ray telescope under consideration .    the treatment for electrons and positrons is complicated by diffusion and energy loss processes .",
    "we model these with a diffusion equation of the form @xmath16+\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial e}\\big[b(e,\\vec{r})\\frac{{\\rm d}n_e}{{\\rm d}e}\\big ] + q_e(e,\\vec{r}),\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the electron and positron spectrum , @xmath18 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath19 is the energy loss term .",
    "analytical solutions to the equation above exist in the equilibrium regime ( see e.g. app .  a in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as long as the spatial dependence of both the diffusion coefficient and the energy loss term are dropped , and spherical symmetry in the dark matter distribution is assumed ( in the present study we make the same hypotheses ) . the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on energy is assumed to be a power law of the form @xmath20 very little is known about diffusion in systems of the type of interest here , i.e. dsph galaxies .",
    "this forces us to make educated guesses about @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the best known system as far as cosmic ray propagation is concerned is by all means our own galaxy . @xcite",
    "analyzed data on cosmic ray fluxes in the milky way , in particular ratios of primary to secondary species .",
    "the outcome of their analysis was to determine the preferred values for the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 , in the framework of a diffusion setup similar to the one outlined here .",
    "their median values are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which we employ here as reference values . using the phenomenological ranges found by @xcite",
    ", we will also consider values of the parameter @xmath25 .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 is related to the size and scale of galactic magnetic field inhomogeneities ; data on galaxy clusters indicate that larger systems feature larger values for @xmath21 than galactic - size systems .",
    "this can be understood by estimating the diffusion coefficient @xmath21 in the context of passive advective transport in a turbolent flow as the product of the turbolent velocity @xmath26 and of the turbolent injection scale @xmath27 .",
    "if the turbolent velocity in clusters of galaxies is of the order of the velocity dispersion of galaxies ( say @xmath28 km / s ) , and the injection scale is of the order of the galactic scale ( say , @xmath29 kpc ) , then the predicted @xmath30 is indeed close in value to what is observed in clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* quote for instance @xmath31 for the hydra a galaxy cluster ) . scaling this estimate from cluster down to galactic scales , and using the reference value for @xmath21 from galactic cosmic ray data obtained by @xcite indicates , assuming @xmath26 for the galaxy is smaller by a factor 10 than in clusters , that the value of @xmath27 for galaxies is at least a factor 100 smaller than for clusters .",
    "conservatively assuming that @xmath27 does not change switching from a milky way size galaxy to a dsph , the simple scaling in @xmath26 of the diffusion coefficient points to @xmath32 , given that the velocity dispersion of the milky way is more than one order of magnitude larger than those observed in local dsph galaxies .",
    "in this respect , we might expect values for @xmath21 smaller than the conservative milky way median value we use as a reference here .",
    "we will therefore also consider as an alternative value @xmath33 , and we will discuss the dependence of the x - ray emission from dark matter pair - annihilation on both @xmath21 and @xmath22 in sec.[sec : constraints ] .",
    "another important parameter for the diffusion model is the diffusion volume , where eq.([eq : trans ] ) is solved , at the boundary of which free - escape boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "following @xcite , we assume a spherical diffusion zone , and a diffusion radius @xmath34 corresponding to twice the radius of the stellar component , typically a few kpc for local dsph galaxies .",
    "this choice is again motivated by analogy with the picture for the milky way .",
    "the value of @xmath34 is also a crucial parameter for the computation of the x - ray emission from dark matter annihilation : the smaller the radius of the diffusion region , the larger the fraction of @xmath0 escaping and diffusing away , hence the smaller the x - ray emission .",
    "the energy loss term , which is assumed to be position - independent , includes the following terms @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 where @xmath37 indicates the thermal electron density and @xmath38 .",
    "we set in what follows the average magnetic field to @xmath39 g , in concordance with radio observations at 5 ghz of dsph galaxies reported in @xcite , and the thermal electron density to @xmath40 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "no measurements are available on the average magnetic field for the dsph galaxies under investigation here .",
    "( [ eq : enloss ] ) indicates that with our reference choice for @xmath41 , energy losses for energetic electrons and positrons ( @xmath42 gev ) are dominated by inverse compton processes .",
    "smaller values for the magnetic field would thus in no way affect our results .",
    "however , larger values for @xmath41 could be in principle allowed by available data ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "synchrotron losses dominate over ic for @xmath43 g . above that value , we expect a suppression on the secondary x - ray emission from wimp annihilation , since the density of energetic electrons and positrons are depleted by more efficient energy losses .",
    "larger average magnetic fields would however also produce an intense radio emission , also from secondary processes related to wimp annihilation .",
    "the results of @xcite indicate that , in the case of the draco dsph , for @xmath44 g , the synchrotron emission originating from wimp annihilation would violate vla limits on radio emission @xcite .",
    "the thermal electron density only affects the strength of coulomb losses ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : enloss ] ) ) , and thus the low energy part ( @xmath45 gev ) of the electron - positron equilibrium spectrum .",
    "larger values for @xmath37 would thus only affect the low energy end of the ic emission in the multi - wavelength spectrum , well below the x - ray regime of interest here .",
    "in addition , @xmath46 would lead to some significant thermal bremsstrahlung emission , potentially in conflict with the limits on x - ray emission we present below .    after specifying the dark matter density profile and the @xmath0 injection spectrum , eq.([eq : trans ] )",
    "can be integrated to find the equilibrium distribution @xmath17 . in turn ,",
    "knowledge of the spatial and energy distribution of @xmath0 allows us to compute the multi - wavelength secondary emission . for our purposes , and in the energy range of interest here , the dominant contribution comes from the up - scattering of cmb photons .",
    "while a contribution from starlight and background light at other frequencies is also expected , it is generically subdominant in the x - ray band .",
    "the inverse compton power is obtained by folding the number density of target photons @xmath47 ( here , the cmb black body spectrum ) with the ic scattering cross section : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the @xmath0 energy , @xmath50 is the target photon energy , @xmath51 is the energy of the up - scattered photon , and @xmath52 indicates the klein - nishina formula ( the full relativistic qed form of the thomson scattering cross - section ) .",
    "folding the ic power with the @xmath0 equilibrium distribution , we get the local emissivity @xmath53 finally , the integrated flux density spectrum , as in the case of gamma rays , is given by the angular and line of sight integral of the expression above ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : gr ] ) ) .",
    "the last ingredient needed to actually compute the broad band spectrum of dark matter annihilation is to specify the particle dark matter model . up to a normalization factor depending on the dark matter density profile and on the dark matter pair annihilation rate , all that matters as far as the particle dark matter model is the mass @xmath14 and the set @xmath54 of branching ratios into given standard model final states . for simplicity and to allow comparison with other studies , we choose particle dark matter models with branching ratio 1 into a certain final state ( i.e. always annihilating into the same standard model final state ) .",
    "we choose as a reference model a 100 gev wimp pair - annihilating into a @xmath55 pair ( the resulting spectrum for other quark - antiquark final states is very similar to this one ) .",
    "our choice is also motivated by the fact that many supersymmetric models feature this particular final state as the dominant one ( examples include the bulk and funnel regions of minimal supergravity , and generic bino - like models with large @xmath56 , see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we show the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for this particular dark matter particle model with a black line in both panels in fig.[fig : sed ] , where we only show photon energies larger than 10 ev .",
    "we chose the normalization so that the integrated gamma - ray flux between 0.1 and 10 gev is @xmath57 photons per @xmath58 per s , over an angular region of one degree , which roughly corresponds to the egret point - source sensitivity @xcite .",
    "for reference , we use a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) dark matter density profile @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 indicates the distance from the center of the dsph galaxy , and where we set the scale radius @xmath61 kpc . also , we set @xmath62 kpc . in the left panel",
    "we assess how the particle physics model affects the dark matter annihilation sed .",
    "the dashed green line indicates the result for a model with the same 100 gev mass , but annihilating into @xmath63 , a final state also motivated by supersymmetry ( e.g. in the stau coannihilation region ) , which features a harder @xmath0 injection spectrum , as well as a harder gamma - ray spectrum . a more abundant population of energetic electrons and positrons results in an ic spectrum which peaks at larger energies than for a softer injection spectrum , such as the reference model . in the soft x - ray band ,",
    "however , while we find different spectral indices , the two models have a similar level of emission at a given gamma - ray luminosity .",
    "the dot - dashed red line indicates , again for @xmath64 gev , the case of the @xmath8 final state , found e.g. in higgsino and wino supersymmetric dark matter models .",
    "this case is intermediate between the two previous ones , and , compared to the reference model has a population of energetic electrons and positrons resulting from e.g. @xmath65 , @xmath66 , which is responsible for the bump in the ic emission in the mev region . changing the mass of the dark matter particle shifts the sed : a larger @xmath14 yields more energetic @xmath0 , as can be appreciated comparing the black and the double - dotted - dashed blue line ( @xmath67 gev ) .",
    "again , the x - ray region is however only mildly affected .",
    "notice that a generic feature of the x - ray spectrum is a hard ( @xmath68 ) photon spectral index , harder than most astrophysical x - ray sources , particularly diffuse thermal emission .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] we study the impact of changing the parameters in the diffusion model on the dark matter annihilation sed . a smaller diffusion coefficient ( orange dashed line , @xmath33 ) suppresses @xmath0 diffusion and escape from the diffusive region , yielding a larger ic flux , particularly in the x - ray band of interest here .",
    "the choice of @xmath21 is therefore very significant in the computation of the expected x - ray flux ; we will quantitatively analyze this statement in sec.[sec : constraints ] , fig.[fig : compare ] .",
    "a milder rigidity dependence in the diffusion coefficient ( i.e. a smaller @xmath22 , set to zero for the double - dashed - dotted indigo line ) leads , at fixed @xmath21 , to a suppressed diffusion of the most energetic @xmath0 ( i.e.  the diffusion coefficient is smaller for @xmath69 gev ) . as a consequence ,",
    "we get an enhancement of the high - energy ic photons and a suppression at lower up - scattered photon energies .",
    "the result on the x - ray emission is a mild suppression .",
    "finally , the magenta dot - dashed line indicates the effect of taking a diffusive region with a radius a factor 5 smaller than our benchmark choice .",
    "this corresponds to a diffusion volume more than a factor 100 smaller : in turn , this implies a much larger loss of @xmath0 escaping the diffusion region , leading to a significant suppression of the electron / positron number density and , therefore , of the ic x - ray signal .    in summary ,",
    "significant uncertainties affect the computation of the ic x - ray emission resulting from dark matter annihilation ; while for a given diffusion model the differences in the soft x - ray band are rather mild , changing the parameters in the diffusion setup affects quite significantly both the normalization and ( although less dramatically ) the spectrum of the predicted sed ; the reference diffusion setup chosen here gives rather conservative predictions for the x - ray flux ; the outstanding features of the signal we are after are therefore ( 1 ) extended emission and ( 2 ) a hard spectral index .",
    "of the nearby local group dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies , three have observations in the xmm - newton archive : ursa minor observed for 52 ks between august and october 2005 ( obsids 0301690201 , 0301690301 , 0301690401 , 0301690501 ) , fornax observed for 104 ks in august 2005 ( obsid 0302500101 ) , and carina observed for 42 ks in may 2004 ( obsid 0200500201 ) . here",
    "we focus on xmm observations as its large effective area and large field - of - view are ideal for detecting faint diffuse emission , while its fairly small psf allows us to exclude x - ray point source contamination from x - ray binaries and background agn .",
    "a couple of additional local dsphs have been observed with chandra and suzaku , but much of these data are not yet public .",
    "all of the xmm observations were taken in full frame mode ; for ursa minor and carina the thin optical blocking filter was used , while for fornax the medium filter was used .",
    "unfortunately , the background flare filtering , discussed below , reveals that three of the observations of ursa minor are highly contaminated with background flares . in our analysis",
    ", we use only obsid 0301690401 for this dwarf .",
    "in addition , for the fornax and ursa minor observations ccd6 on mos1 was not available , but this ccd does not fall within the considered source region ( see below ) .",
    "the data were reduced using xmmsas version 7.1.0 , and all observations were reprocessed using the epic chain tasks .",
    "for emos data , we use patterns 0 - 12 and apply the # xmmea_em flag filtering , and for epn data , we use patterns 0 - 4 and flag equal to zero . due to the time variability in the spectra of background flares @xcite",
    ", we filter for periods of high background in several energy bands .",
    "we first apply a conservative cut on the high energy count rate matching the 2xmmp pipeline and the epic blank - sky event file filtering ( @xmath70 cts s@xmath71 for emos data and @xmath72 cts s@xmath71 for epn data ) .",
    "this cut removes the most egregious flares . in the case of carina",
    ", we found that the observations contained a number of milder flares that were not removed by this conservative cut , but never the less biased the background rate high , and for this dwarf we found it necessary to apply more stringent high energy count rate cuts of @xmath73 cts s@xmath71 for emos data and @xmath74 cts s@xmath71 for epn data .",
    "for all dwarfs , we then applied a 3@xmath52 clipping to the source - free count rate in three energy bands , 0.5 - 2 kev , 2 - 5 kev , and 5 - 8 kev . here",
    "time bins ( bin size of 100 secs ) with rates more than 3@xmath52 away from the mean are removed recursively until the mean is stable .",
    "as noted above , the flare filtering excluded nearly all of the exposure time from three of the four ursa minor observations .",
    "the final clean exposure times are listed in table 1 along with the adopted dwarf central positions .",
    "we describe below the limits we obtain for the diffuse x - ray emission from the selected dsph galaxies ( sec .",
    "[ sec : xraylimt ] ) , and how these limits constrain particle dark matter models ( sec .  [",
    "sec : constraints ] ) .      before comparing our model predictions to the actual x - ray data",
    ", we preformed a detailed study of the optimal energy and angular range where we expect the largest possible signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) . specifically , considering both the xmm - newton affective area versus energy and the range of possible x - ray spectra resulting from the secondary emissions of @xmath0 produced in wimp annihilations , we find that the expected signal - to - noise peaks in roughly the 0.5 - 8 kev band .",
    "we illustrate this point in fig .",
    "[ fig : optener ] , where we show contours of constant signal - to - noise in the plane defined by the lower energy limit @xmath75 and by the upper energy limit @xmath76 .",
    "we integrate over the @xmath77 $ ] interval the signal obtained from wimp annihilations ( after diffusion , modeled according to the reference setup described above ) and we divide by the square root of the background over the same energy interval .",
    "we show the xmm background count rate in the inset of the left panel .",
    "the s / n grows towards the red cross , which indicates the best values . in the left panel",
    "we assume a soft @xmath0 injection spectrum ( for reference , a 100 gev wimp pair annihilating into @xmath78 pairs ) , while in the right panel we take a hard injection spectrum ( 100 gev wimp annihilating into @xmath63 pairs ) .",
    "we verified that varying the wimp mass does nt affect the position of the best energy interval .",
    "also , any combination of final states in the context of particle dark matter models motivated by beyond the standard model physics falls in between the two final states under consideration here .",
    "we obtain that with a soft injection spectrum the best energy range ( giving the highest signal - over background ) is [ 0.44,7.8 ] ( all energies are in kev ) , while for a hard spectrum it is [ 0.83,9.0 ] .",
    "we decided to use the 0.5 - 8 kev range as the optimal x - ray band for xmm .",
    "similarly , we use the xmm sensitivity versus off - axis angle and the observed dark matter profiles of the dwarf galaxies to explore the optimal source radius .",
    "the total size of the dwarfs extends beyond the xmm field - of - view , but the expected x - ray flux decreases significantly with radius as the dark matter density drops as well as through the telescope vignetting . neglecting the effect of diffusion , the maximal s / n is obtained for the smallest possible angular regions for profiles which diverge with @xmath79 , such as the nfw profile . for cored profiles the best s / n ( again in the limit of no spatial diffusion )",
    "is achieved around the profile scaling radius @xmath80 .",
    "factoring in diffusion , we find that the optimal angular region significantly increases .",
    "the optimal radius therefore depends both on the assumed dark matter profile and on the diffusion model , but in all cases we find that a radius of @xmath81 is a good choice .",
    "we investigate whether we detect diffuse x - ray emission from these dwarfs above what we expect from the x - ray background .",
    "first , we detect and exclude x - ray point sources ; point sources are detected using the sas wavelet detection routine , ewavelet , in a mosaiced 0.5 - 8 kev band image of all three detectors , and data within a @xmath82 radius region of the source locations are excluded .",
    "we then compare the detected flux within a @xmath83 radius aperture of the dwarf center to the expected x - ray background flux in that region of the detector by comparing to the epic blank - sky event files .",
    "the blank - sky files are collected from all over the sky , while the dwarf galaxies considered here all lie outside of the galactic plane in regions of fairly low hydrogen column density .",
    "we , therefore , use the tool bgselector to create blank - sky files using only regions with similar galactic hydrogen column density to the dwarf galaxies ; specifically , we filter on nh between @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xmath86 .",
    "we then apply the same pattern , flag , and multi - band flare filtering to the background files as was used for the dwarf galaxy observations ( sec .",
    "3 ) . finally",
    ", we re - project the appropriate blank - field event files ( medium filter for fornax and thin filter for ursa minor and carina ) to match the sky position of the dwarf galaxy observations using the routine skycast .",
    "renormalizing the blank - field count rate in the source region ( i.e. within @xmath87 excluding point source regions ) using the ratio of the count rate in the blank - fields to that in the dwarf galaxy observations in an outer region of the detector ( where the source flux is expected to be much lower ) , we find that none of the three dwarfs show significant diffuse x - ray emission above what is expected from the x - ray background .",
    "as shown below , the non - detection of diffuse x - ray emission from dwarf galaxies places limits on the possible particle dark matter model .",

    "limits on the dark matter pair annihilation cross section were also obtained by @xcite by comparing the cosmic diffuse neutrino signal that would result from dark matter pair annihilation and comparing it to the measured terrestrial atmospheric neutrino background .",

    "less conservative assumptions on either one of those points pushes the constraints into interesting regions of the parameter space of particle dark matter models ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fornax ] ) .",
    "we showed that currently available x - ray and gamma - ray data from nearby dsph galaxies put comparable constraints on particle dark matter indirect detection even for very conservative diffusion setups ; a suppression of cosmic ray diffusion appropriate for a dsph scale galaxy makes x - ray data more sensitive to particle dark matter pair annihilation by about one order of magnitude compared to gamma rays . in the next section",

    "we pointed out that local dsph galaxies are an ideal environment for particle dark matter searches with x - rays .",
    "we described how x - rays are produced as secondary radiation in inverse compton scattering off cosmic microwave background photons of electrons and positrons resulting from particle dark matter annihilation .",
    "the resulting spectrum is only mildly dependent on the details of the particle dark matter model ( the dark matter mass and the dominant final state into which it pair annihilates ) , and it is , generically , hard ( spectral index smaller than @xmath125 ) .",
    "the normalization of the emission depends on ( 1 ) the particle dark matter pair annihilation rate , ( 2 ) the diffusion setup , and ( 3 ) the dark matter density distribution . for reasonable choices of these three _ a priori _ unknown inputs of the problem ,",
    "the x - ray emission is potentially within reach of current x - ray detectors .",
    "interestingly enough , the shape of the spectral energy distribution indicates that for dsph galaxies x - rays have a comparable , if not better , sensitivity to indirect dark matter detection than gamma rays .",
    "we used xmm - newton archival data on three local group dsph galaxies , ursa minor , fornax and carina , to search for the diffuse x - ray emission expected from dark matter annihilation .",
    "we studied the optimal energy and radial range to search for this type of emission , and concluded that for xmm - newton and for the dsph galaxies under investigation these correspond to an energy band between 0.5 and 8 kev and to a radius of around @xmath126 .",
    "we do not find any significant signal over background , and this , in turn , was turned into constraints on particle dark matter models .",
    "the best constraints result from both the fornax and the ursa minor observations , while data from carina result in bounds that are a factor of a few weaker .",
    "ursa minor features the largest dark matter density , making it the best candidate target , but has the shortest usable xmm exposure .    in determining the impact on particle dark matter searches of our x - ray constraints , we pointed out the uncertainties resulting from the modeling of cosmic ray diffusion processes , and from the dark matter distribution .",
    "in particular , including dark matter substructures can boost our constraints significantly .",
    "we phrase the bounds we obtain in terms of the dominant dark matter annihilation final states . for those final states relevant for specific dark matter models , such as supersymmetry , the constraints on the mass versus pair annihilation plane are very similar .",
    "we then proceeded to examine how x - ray constraints on particle dark matter annihilation in local dsph galaxies limit the available parameter space of supersymmetric dark matter . in the most conservative setup only models with rather large annihilation cross sections are excluded . assuming a smaller diffusion coefficient , or factoring in the effect of dark matter substructures , our constraints fall well within the interesting region where the supersymmetric dark matter can be a thermal relic from the early universe",
    "also , we were able to set limits on particular supersymmetric dark matter scenarios , such as wino or higgsino lightest neutralino dark matter .",
    "an important result of the present analysis is that even assuming a conservative diffusion setup the sensitivity of x - rays and of gamma rays to particle dark matter annihilation in dsph galaxies are comparable .",
    "this fact has two - fold implications : on the one hand , if longer observations of dsph galaxies were carried out with existing telescopes , it is possible that the first astronomical signature of particle dark matter annihilation would come from x - rays .",
    "secondly , should a signature be detected in the future with gamma - ray telescopes , it would be extremely important to confirm the nature of the signal via x - ray observations .    in this respect ,",
    "it is relevant to comment here on how future gamma - ray and x - ray telescopes will improve indirect dark matter searches through observations of nearby dsph galaxies .",
    "the lat instrument on - board the soon to be launched glast satellite will extend the gamma - ray energy range available to egret , with tremendously increased effective area and energy as well as angular resolution .",
    "glast will be an ideal telescope to search for dark matter annihilation in dsph galaxies . assuming a diffuse background flux of @xmath127 photons @xmath128 s@xmath71 sr@xmath71 integrated above 0.1 gev , and an effective spectral index in the gamma - ray band of 2.1",
    ", we find that the glast lat sensitivity from 5 years of data will improve over the egret point - source sensitivity by large factors . in the mass",
    "versus pair annihilation cross section plane , and assuming a soft gamma ray spectrum ( @xmath78 ) , glast will improve over egret by factors ranging between @xmath113 and @xmath129 , the first corresponding to a light @xmath130 gev dark matter particle , and the latter to a heavy one ( @xmath131 gev ) . assuming a harder gamma - ray spectrum , as appropriate for other dark matter models ( e.g. universal extra dimensions , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the glast performance will be factors between 30 and 300 better than egret .",
    "a signal of dark matter pair annihilations in gamma - rays appears therefore very promising with glast .",
    "if detected , such a source would need to be confirmed in its nature , and using a multi - wavelength approach is one of the most promising strategies .",
    "future x - ray telescopes , like constellation - x and xeus , will also have greatly increased effective areas with respect to current instruments . using the currently available projections for the effective areas and backgrounds of these telescopes",
    ", we estimate that the x - ray limits ( 0.5 - 8 kev band ) placed by a 100 ksec observation of ursa minor with constellation - x or xeus would improve over the limits placed in this paper by factors of roughly 35 and 70 , respectively .",
    "thus even for a conservative diffusion model , the future generation of x - ray telescopes will place similar constraints on dark matter annihilation from dwarfs as glast , stronger constraints at particle masses below a few hundred gev .",
    "in addition , a signal from glast could be confirmed with x - ray observations .",
    "observations at other wavelengths will also be of great relevance to identify particle dark matter and its properties .",
    "in particular , a diffuse radio signal should also be part of the multiwavelength yield of particle dark matter annihilation .",
    "however , the level of the radio emission is crucially dependent upon the average magnetic field , which adds further uncertainties both in setting constraints and in understanding the nature of particle dark matter , should a signal be detected .",
    "observations in the hard x - ray band would also be useful ; however , as opposed to cluster of galaxies , where the effect of diffusion on the dark matter multi - wavelength sed is typically mild ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in dsph galaxies high energy electrons and positrons escape more efficiently from the diffusive region , suppressing the hard x - ray emission .",
    "@xcite recently estimated the gamma - ray flux from dark matter annihilation in newly discovered , extremely low luminosity and dark matter dominated milky way dwarf galaxies .",
    "the expected gamma - ray flux from these nearby galaxies can be larger than that from previously known dwarfs , depending on the so far poorly known dark matter density distribution .",
