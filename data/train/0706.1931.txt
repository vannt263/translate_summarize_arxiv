    "explanations for this discrepancy have been put forward , but most employ a modification of general relativity on cosmological scales or the addition of an exotic  dark energy \" field .    there have also been attempts to explain this seemingly anomalous cosmic acceleration as a consequence of subhorizon inhomogeneity , rather than modified gravity or dark energy .",
    "a perturbation is referred to as  subhorizon \" if its wavelength is small compared to the hubble length : @xmath10 .",
    "it has been suggested that small - scale density perturbations could cause the appearance of accelerated expansion without the need to introduce any form of dark energy , which is an appealing prospect @xcite .",
    "the fact that inhomogeneity can systematically modify our interpretation of cosmological measurements was first realized by ellis , who called it the  fitting problem \" @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is this : due to the nonlinearity of the einstein equation , the operators for taking spatial averages and for time evolution do not commute .",
    "this means that , although our universe is homogeneous in the mean , it will likely not have the same time evolution as that of the corresponding homogeneous universe .",
    "nevertheless , we routinely fit distance data to frw models , a procedure that introduces errors into the inferred properties of our universe , and these errors will be present even for very large samples of type ia supernovae .    our goal in this paper is to calculate the lowest order fitting effect by calculating the cosmological constant density @xmath0 that one would deduce from a perturbed luminosity distance - redshift relation @xmath11 . if we treat cosmological fluctuations perturbatively and as a random process as suggested by the ",
    "fair sample hypothesis \" @xcite , then this fitting effect should be fundamentally nonlinear in the density contrast @xmath12 , requiring that we work to at least second order in @xmath13 .",

    ", we find that the lowest order inhomogeneity - induced correction to the luminosity distance scales as @xmath27 .",

    "the best - fit @xmath32 also becomes larger as @xmath33 becomes smaller , since @xmath34 becomes large on small scales .",
    "although this ensemble averaged result is still quite small , we find that the variance can be @xmath35 for a sample of 100 supernovae out to a redshift @xmath36 .",
    "one implication of these results is that precision measurements of the cosmological constant from nearby supernova data require that we measure @xmath11 over a large enough redshift range , with a large enough sample .",
    "one could also try to correct for some of the effects of inhomogeneity , using available information about large scale structure and about our own peculiar velocity @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented here is more realistic than similar analyses within the context of simplified models of structure formation , such as the spherically symmetric lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) models @xcite , swiss cheese models @xcite and their variants @xcite .",
    "this is because we look at the full three dimensional problem , and assume that there are no bulk flows on cosmological length scales .",
    "there have also been analyses of the perturbations to the luminosity distance - redshift relation that go to newtonian order @xcite , that only consider superhorizon perturbation modes @xcite , and that use taylor expansions of the luminosity distance @xcite , which are most appropriate for long - wavelength perturbations .",

    "our analysis is also fundamentally different from those in refs .",
    "@xcite , as we choose a different method for obtaining averaged expansion parameters .",
    "these authors average the expansion rate over a constant time slice , whereas we choose to calculate only observable quantities , namely the luminosity distance and the redshift , along the past light cone of the observer .",
    "we then combine these expressions into @xmath37 , average over viewing angles and ensemble average , and then fit the results to what one would expect in a homogeneous model containing dust and a cosmological constant to find the best - fit value for @xmath0 .",
    "this approach better simulates the process of gathering and analyzing supernova data , and it leads to a different result with a stable perturbative expansion .    refs .",
    "@xcite base their characterization of the expansion rate of the universe on quantities that are not related to how observers have deduced the existence of dark energy . in these papers",
    ", perturbations are spatially averaged over a constant time slice .",
    "such a spatial average is somewhat arbitrary , as it is dependent on the choice of spatial hypersurface .",
    "this is in contrast to the observable significance of @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite also use the synchronous gauge for their calculations , wherein there are metric perturbations of order @xmath13 . since @xmath38 on small scales , this gauge is particularly ill suited to perturbation theory .",
    "in contrast , in newtonian - type gauges the metric perturbation is of order @xmath39 .",
    "we explore this difference in section vi .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section ii below , we introduce our coordinate choice , wherein we recast the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric as an expansion around flat space , and in section iii we present the fundamental post - newtonian optics equations that we will need for this calculation .",
    "we then explain our method of computation and calculate the necessary unperturbed quantities in section iv . here",
    "we also compute the luminosity distances and redshifts for a perturbed matter dominated universe , finding @xmath26 and @xmath40 to second order in @xmath13 and to third order in @xmath18 , and we find that we may write the lowest order correction to @xmath11 in terms of the peculiar velocity field .",
    "we then fit to a homogeneous model in section v to find the best - fit @xmath0 and its variance .",
    "the detailed redshift and luminosity distance equations are in appendix a , the necessary results of second order perturbation theory are reviewed in appendix b , and the averaging is discussed in appendix c. then , in section vi we discuss the previous results in the synchronous gauge and show that one can choose coordinates and a definition of  acceleration \" such that it appears as though there could be a larger fitting effect .",
    "we argue that such a result would be unphysical . a detailed discussion of transforming to synchronous coordinates is given in appendix d. finally , in section vii we make our concluding remarks . as usual ,",
    "greek indices will be summed over all four spacetime dimensions while latin indices will be summed only over the three spatial dimensions .",
    "we will also write 3-vectors in boldface and put arrows over 4-vectors .",
