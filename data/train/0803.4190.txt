    "the chiral symmetry of the strong interaction places significant constraints on hadron - hadron interactions at low energies .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath6pt ) implements these constraints in a systematic fashion .",
    "( for recent reviews see refs .",
    "in contrast to the situation in the single - nucleon and mesonic sectors , low - energy nucleon - nucleon interactions do not vanish in the chiral limit , with experimental manifestations of the strength of the @xmath0 interaction at low energies being provided by the large @xmath7 scattering length in the @xmath1s@xmath2 channel and the presence of a bound state ( the deuteron ) in the @xmath8s@xmath9 channel .",
    "this complicates the application of perturbation - theory methods to multi - nucleon interactions .",
    "weinberg s pioneering efforts  @xcite in the early nineties proposed surmounting this difficulty by making a @xmath6pt expansion for the @xmath0 potential , @xmath10 , that goes into the schrdinger equation , i.e. solving : @xmath11 with @xmath12 here the superscripts indicate the power of the ( presumably ) small quantities @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the momentum of the @xmath0 collision and @xmath16 the scale of chiral - symmetry breaking ) that is present in that piece of @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath6pt calculation then reveals that @xmath17 includes one - pion exchange and a short - range interaction , @xmath18 includes higher - derivative short - range interactions , together with two - pion exchange diagrams constructed from the leading - order @xmath6pt lagrangian , and @xmath19 involves the so - called `` next - to - leading order '' two - pion exchange , where the @xmath20 vertices are those from @xmath21 of @xmath6pt .",
    "in weinberg s original paper there was no distinction made between the power counting for the piece of the potential that is operative at long distances ( @xmath22 ) and that for the delta functions and their derivatives which represent the shorter - range mechanisms ( @xmath23 ) in this approach .",
    "both are assumed to give a contribution to the @xmath0 potential of an order given by naive dimensional analysis in powers of @xmath15 and @xmath24 .",
    "the implications of the expansion ( [ eq : v ] ) for @xmath0 scattering data were first examined in detail by ordoez et al . in their landmark 1996 paper  @xcite .",
    "these authors analyzed @xmath0 scattering , not only in the @xmath25s@xmath2 , but also in a number of other partial waves .",
    "improvements on this analysis were made in the work of epelbaum and co - authors  @xcite , while peripheral @xmath0 partial waves were analyzed in first- and second - born approximation in ref .",
    "two sets of authors have subsequently extended these analyses to fourth order in @xmath10  @xcite . in all these studies the expansion ( [ eq : v ] ) yielded reasonably convergent results for @xmath0 phase shifts .",
    "kaplan , savage , and wise ( ksw )  @xcite have demonstrated that the assumption that naive dimensional analysis sets the size of the short - distance pieces of the potential is chirally inconsistent , in the sense that iterations of the leading - order @xmath10 ( [ eq : v ] ) via the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : se ] ) generate divergences proportional to @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "but , at leading order in weinberg s expansion , there is no counterterm to absorb this divergence .",
    "ksw proposed an alternative expansion , wherein the delta - function interaction @xmath27 was promoted to leading - order , but one - pion exchange retained its naive - dimensional - analysis scaling , making it sub - leading in this expansion .",
    "this expansion was carefully examined in the @xmath25s@xmath2 channel  @xcite , and appears to converge reasonably well there .",
    "however , the ksw expansion does not converge in the @xmath28s@xmath9 channel for momenta @xmath29  mev  @xcite .",
    "a compromise proposal is to expand one - pion exchange about its chiral limit value , in which case it is leading in the @xmath28s@xmath9 and sub - leading in @xmath25s@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the resulting series has been shown to converge , albeit slowly .    however , two - pion - exchange corrections are yet to be considered in light of the analysis of the @xmath25s@xmath2 of refs .",
    "the discussions in these works focused on establishing the correct power counting for the @xmath0 potential @xmath10 in the case that the long - range potential is one - pion exchange , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "( for other research that bears on the role of one - pion exchange in this channel see refs .",

    "first , is there empirical evidence for these two - pion exchange contributions , and , concomitantly , what impact do they have on our understanding of the short - range dynamics in the @xmath0 system ?",
    "second , is there any sense in which @xmath18 and @xmath19 are `` small '' ?",
    "i.e. one ( or more ) of the expansions proposed for @xmath0 dynamics in refs .",
    "@xcite is converging .",
    "the weakness of one - pion exchange in the @xmath1s@xmath2 channel  thanks to the absence of the tensor pieces of the @xmath0 potential that generate , e.g. deuteron binding  means that these questions are of crucial importance in the development of a quantitative theory of @xmath0 scattering in this channel .",
    "in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite , we do not compare predictions from a treatment of the @xmath0 potential ( or amplitude ) within a given chiral power counting with data .",
    "instead we examine the extent to which phase - shift data obtained by the nijmegen group  @xcite can be used to make inferences regarding the @xmath0 potentials that are at work for @xmath23 . to do this",
    "we invoke @xmath6pt with only nucleons and pions as explicit degrees of freedom to obtain @xmath10 at distances @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "( the @xmath6pt expansion for @xmath10 converges quite well in this domain , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "we then start with the nijmegen pwa93 phase shift  @xcite at a fixed energy and use the long - range potential at a given order in @xmath6pt to integrate in to a finite distance @xmath3 . the formalism for this treatment",
    "is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec - outsidein ] .",
    "such an `` outside in '' approach , that begins with phase shifts , and uses a @xmath6pt potential to deduce information about short - distance dynamics in the @xmath1s@xmath2 channel , was already pursued in refs .",
    "however , in these works only the leading - order @xmath6pt potential @xmath31 was employed for this purpose . and while the nnlo chiral potential @xmath32 was used to do the integration in ref .",
    "@xcite , only values @xmath33 were discussed there .",
    "when such an analysis is performed over the range @xmath34 mev it yields information on the energy dependence that the short - range interaction must have if it is to be used in concert with the long - range @xmath10 of @xmath6pt ( at a fixed order ) to reproduce data .",
    "( this method is very similar to those of the phase - shift analysis itself , although in ref .",
    "@xcite a different long - range potential was employed . ) since our effective field theory ( eft ) does not contain explicit delta degrees of freedom we limit ourselves to data at fairly low energies : @xmath5 mev .",
    "the results for the inferred energy dependence due to short - range @xmath0 dynamics are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec - endepres ] . while any energy dependence due to short - range dynamics is in principle possible , short - range potentials with coefficients that are natural with respect to the high scale @xmath35",
    "will lead to smooth , not rapid , energy dependence on the interval @xmath36 mev . as one might expect ,",
    "if @xmath3 is too large , the energy dependence over this entire energy interval is not smooth , since the @xmath0 collision probes details of the regulator if @xmath37 is greater than or of order @xmath38 .",
    "however , we find that for @xmath39 fm only smooth energy dependence of the short - range potential is needed , and that this conclusion holds essentially irrespective of the @xmath6pt long - range potential that governs @xmath0 dynamics in the region from @xmath40 to @xmath41 .",
    "the second question is whether dynamics in that region can be understood in perturbation theory . in section  [ sec - pert ]",
    "we show that the long - distance pion - exchange interactions derived from @xmath6pt can indeed be treated in perturbation theory in the region @xmath42 fm .",

    "[ sec - conclusion ] we offer some conclusions and an outlook .",
    "we choose to work in co - ordinate space and hence the basic task is to solve the radial schrdinger equation : @xmath45 here , @xmath46 is the c.m .",
    "energy of the @xmath0 system , and @xmath47 its reduced mass .",
    "we adopt @xmath48  mev . by the substitution @xmath49 the equation reduces to @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "our objective in this section is to solve this equation in the region @xmath53 .",
    "because of this , an important feature of our solution is that we do not use the usual boundary condition @xmath54 .",
    "instead , we invert the problem and use the nijmegen pwa93  @xcite extraction of the @xmath55 phase shifts as input that provides the boundary condition at @xmath56 : @xmath57 @xmath58 being the experimental phase - shift corresponding to c.m .- frame relative momentum @xmath59 .",
    "the normalization is done in such a manner that the asymptotic zero - energy solution is given by @xmath60 , @xmath61 being the scattering length .",
    "the purpose of solving the schrdinger equation in this way is to obtain an energy - dependent matching condition at any @xmath3 ( which is naively of the order of or smaller than the range of pion - exchange interaction ) .",
    "this matching condition is defined by the logarithmic derivative : @xmath62_{r = r}. \\label{eq : gamfull}\\ ] ] for example , in the absence of any long - range potential ( i.e. the case @xmath63 ) we have : @xmath64 if we incorporate any long - distance potential @xmath10 in the analysis for @xmath65 then the form ( [ eq : nolr ] ) will no longer apply , and in general , we will have only numerical results for @xmath66 .    regardless , the energy dependence of @xmath66 can be fitted with a polynomial in @xmath67 as @xmath68 the fact that we represent @xmath66 in the form ( [ eq : gamai ] ) is guided by the form of the lagrangian for an eft of the @xmath0 interaction . because of parity and time - reversal symmetries , only even powers of @xmath59 can occur in @xmath0 contact interactions .",
    "such local interactions ( in the sense of quantum field theory ) , when smeared over a length scale @xmath3 , will result in energy dependence that is smooth with respect to the scale @xmath3 , and so we expect that @xmath69 . a lucid description of this philosophy of regulating the short - range part of a two - body potential can be found in  @xcite .    the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamai ] ) are then manifestations of the short - range @xmath0 interaction in the @xmath55 channel .",
    "if one wishes these parameters can in turn be used to construct a model that is a particular realization of that short - distance physics . in other words ,",
    "once a @xmath6pt potential of a given order had been used to obtain information on @xmath66 , we would use that information to extract the coefficients of @xmath0 contact interactions @xmath70",
    ", @xmath71 , @xmath72 , etc .",
    "this is very much in the spirit of the nijmegen pwa93 , where stoks _ et al . _",
    "@xcite employed square wells for @xmath73  fm to produce the necessary energy dependence due to short - distance physics .",
    "but , regardless of what potential generates the coefficients @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamai ] ) , the long - range potential ( @xmath75 for @xmath65 ) should produce the faster energy dependence in the phase shifts . removing this more rapid energy dependence by integrating the wave function from @xmath41 in to @xmath40 and examining @xmath66 allows us to look at the behavior of observables with energy that is generated by short - distance dynamics .",
    "so , although a polynomial form like ( [ eq : gamai ] ) is preferred from the eft point of view , we are , at first , agnostic about the form of @xmath66 , and merely report the results obtained from the integrating - in exercise when @xmath6pt potentials of different orders are adopted in the region @xmath76 .",
    "but , before we do that , we first give the details of the @xmath6pt potentials that govern dynamics in that region .      in our analysis",

    "<S> we also find that a quantitative description of @xmath0 dynamics is possible , at least in this channel , if one treats the long - distance parts of the chiral @xmath0 potential in perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to achieve this we have to choose a separation scale @xmath3 that is larger than 1.0 fm . </S>"
