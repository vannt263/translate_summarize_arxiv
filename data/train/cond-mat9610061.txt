    "secondary ion mass spectrometry ( sims ) is widely used for the measurement of doping , impurity and matrix profiles in semiconductors . in this application",
    ", the concentration data required may span @xmath0 orders of magnitude overall , and @xmath1-@xmath2 orders for a particular species . as the sims data do not directly represent the true element profile",
    ", a data quantification procedure is necessary .",
    "various methods from simple linear mapping ( ion dose to depth , signal to concentration ) to deconvolution using response functions of various types @xcite .",
    "due to the complexity of the dynamic sims profile process and the large record dynamic range required , a very careful and unbiased treatment of the measured sims data is vital to the success of a deconvolution method to be used .",
    "it is widely accepted that one of the best deconvolution methods in use is based on maximum entropy @xcite .",
    "we have developed and applied a maximum entropy method to the deconvolution of sims profiles @xcite .",
    "however , the use of the correct noise model is essential in high dynamic range deconvolution , since the adoption of arbitrary noise models can lead to quite different results  both in the depth resolution of the recoved profile , their dynamic range , and the behaviour in the low counts regime .",
    "therefore , the accurate determination of the noise characteristics is an indispensable part of the self - consistent use of deconvolution methods .",
    "noise in sims data can be attributed to four main sources : ( 1 ) the change of the primary ion flux due to statistical fluctuations in the ion source ; ( 2 ) the fluctuation in the effective secondary ion yield due to the statistical nature of sputtering ; ( 3 ) the statistics of the secondary ion detection process , probably dominated by ion to electron conversion probabilities at the first collision with the detector ( in the case of this study , a gallileo corp .",
    "model 4816 channeltron ) ; ( 4 ) there may also be additional effects due to the locally random distribution of atoms of the analytic species , significant when small volumes are analysed . for most depth profiles , integrating the signal over the volume of at least @xmath3 per data point makes this last contribution insignificant . in general , it is very difficult to distinguish the noise generated by different sources within the same process .",
    "the data we normally collect and quantify in dynamic sims are the counts for a pixel or frame , where the latter is effectively the sum over a set of the pixels at a certain depth , in a period of time during which the operating conditions of the instrument are assumed constant .",
    "in other words , we can only study the overall sims noise in our data .",
    "separating noise from signal is not easy and convincing if the signal itself is changing in time .",
    "it is better to keep the signal as steady as possible , _",
    "i.e. _ to maintain the mean value of signal unchanged during a period of time , and then deduce the noise from the collected data . to obtain a steady signal in dynamic sims profiling",
    ", we may use two different approaches .",
    "the first one is to study so - called staircase samples which are made of different levels of constant doping of a specific element in different ranges of depth .",
    "various levels of stable signals in the corresponding mass channel will be obtained when we profile through the samples .",
    "the other approach is to collect data from a certain mass channel which corresponds to a uniform distribution of an element while we change the primary ion current from time to time .",
    "different currents will generate different fluxes of secondary ions varying about a constant mean flux .",
    "a thorough description of a noise requires its frequency distribution @xcite .",
    "if it differs from that of the noise model we wish to use , the accuracy of the deconvolution process will be compromised . however , there is no real problem in which we have sufficient information to fully describe the frequency spectrum @xcite .",
    "fortunately , we do not need so much information about the noise in our quantification procedure .",
    "usually the relation between the magnitude of a noise , which is characterized by its mean - square error ( mse ) , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the signal of the @xmath6-th frame out of a total of @xmath7 frames , and the corresponding mean , @xmath8 , will be sufficient in most cases .",
    "we would like to stress here that the relation between the mses and mean values is not a full description of the noise , but rather a description of our state of knowledge about the noise .",
    "it is related to the fact that we want to be fairly sure that we choose a set of possible solutions big enough to include the true solution during our deconvolution process @xcite .",
    "choosing too `` narrow '' a noise distribution will result in data containing structure for which there is no evidence .",
    "the samples used in this study were four boron staircase structures in silicon grown by mbe at temperatures between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "doping levels varied from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "the samples are designated @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 in what follows .",
    "depth profiles were obtained on our eva  3000 instrument using normally incident @xmath17 ions at beam energies of either @xmath18 or @xmath19 ( typical of high depth resolution conditions ) using @xmath9 and @xmath20 square craters with @xmath21 areal gates ( applied digitally , post acquisition ) . a typical boron profile from sample @xmath16 is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "two types of study were carried out : ( i ) profiles of the boron staircase and silicon matrix intensity at fixed beam current , and ( ii ) profiles of the silicon matrix channel at a variety of beam currents and sample bias , @xmath22 , to vary the input flux to the channeltron over a large dynamic range . in this way it was possible to establish a relationship between @xmath23 and @xmath24 over a wide range of samples and input fluxes .",
    "the experimental conditions are summarized in tables  [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] respectively .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the noise calculated from the profiles of the staircase samples study ( i ) are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the @xmath24 were obtained from the segments of data in which the concentrations are supposed to be constant . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we can see that all the @xmath23 and @xmath24 agree well with the poissonian relation @xmath25 rather than the gaussian one @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "the data start to depart from this relation gradually when the @xmath24 is larger .",
    "since the boron concentrations in our staircase samples were low , we have the data points corresponding to the respective channels in two spatially separated areas on the plot .",
    "study ( ii ) determines whether or not the silicon has the same noise model as the boron , despite the apparent departure from the poissonian behaviour shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .    the corresponding @xmath23 and @xmath24 are shown in fig .",
    "again we can see the poissonian model suits our data well for @xmath28 with a departure for for larger input fluxes to the channeltron .",
    "we conclude therefore that under our experimental conditions the major noise source or the combination of noise sources is effectively poissonian .",
    "the mses and means were calculated from data of finite length .",
    "we chose long segments with large enough number of frames so that the statistical errors involved are much smaller than the quantities in which we are interested .",
    "some of the data exhibited a long term drift of a few % in intensity due to the normal behaviour of a plasma ion source .",
    "to prevent excessive mse values from such data , mse s were calculated from long segments of data where each short segments had almost equal means with no obvious systematic behaviour .",
    "some long segments consisted of a linear drift on the mean , which was recognized by the linear relation of the corresponding means for each short segment and the almost the same magnitude of mses after subtracting a liner drift background . in this situation ,",
    "the overall means were assigned to such mses .",
    "this may lead to a small fraction of error into the relation of the mse and mean , but the relative error involved is no more than the maximum relative difference of the means of short segments within a long segment , which is negligible in our calculations .    to make sure",
    "that the data used in our calculations only involve random noise , we used two methods to analyse them : time - frequency technique @xcite and random walk method @xcite .",
    "the first method uses wigner distribution @xmath29 and is capable of revealing any ordering of frequency components in time , and the second method calculates the root mean square fluctuation of the displacement @xmath30 where @xmath31 and the running sum @xmath32 and can detect the presence of long - range correlations existing in data . no pattern with order was found in our data and the @xmath33 gives @xmath34 for large @xmath35 as expected in uncorrelated time series .",
    "note that the mse of noise in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] becomes graduately larger than what the poissonian relation predicates as the counts @xmath36-@xmath37 .",
    "it appears only to be related to the input flux to the detector . for a better understanding of this phenomenon , we measured the counts per frame in the silicon channel as a function of the primary beam current , @xmath38 .",
    "see figs .",
    "[ fig4](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we found that the counts appear , as expected , to be proportional to the @xmath38 with approximately the same slope when they are @xmath39 per second .",
    "when the output of the channeltron @xmath40 counts per second , the channeltron starts to saturate . when the @xmath38 is increased further , the output drops as the pulse amplitude falls below the counting threshold .",
    "we therefore attribute the departures of the noise from the poissonian relation in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] to the channeltron saturation .",
    "a simple analysis shows that the mse of counts saturates slower than the corresponding mean as the channeltron approaches its saturation .",
    "this agrees qualitatively with the departure trends in both figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "a hysteresis effect on the channeltron output was found as we raised the @xmath38 to saturate the channeltron and then reduced it to the normal value .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) that although the slopes for the linear regimes before and after the channeltron is saturated are nearly the same , the later output is about one order lower than the previous one for the same input flux .",
    "this may possibly be explained by degredation of the surface of the channeltron capillary as a result of the large number of secondary electrons flowing at the anode .",
    "this effect would make it very difficult to quantify sims data if the channeltron is saturated at some stages of profiling .",
    "the poissonian distribution is a result of `` law of small probability '' given by poisson . in sims ,",
    "the ion count is much smaller than the number of secondary ions ejected .",
    "this ratio , known as the useful yield , is @xmath41-@xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively on various instruments @xcite .",
    "the ratio of counted ions to input primary ions is likely to be orders of magnitude smaller still .",
    "such a small probability will normally lead to a statistics of poissonian type , and several poissonian stochastic processes combined together are _ still _ poissonian .",
    "we conclude that the noise in our dynamic sims depth profiles is universally poissonian despite of the change of samples and experimental conditions .",
    "consequently , its mse relates to the mean accurately as described by the poissonian distribution in all the linear dynamic range of our experiments .",
    "the departure from this relation is due to the saturation effect of the channeltron used .",
    "it is worth mentioning that noise characterization is unconsciously or deliberately ignored in many situations .",
    "in fact , when one uses a certain procedure of noise data processing , a particular distribution of noise is usually assigned as asserting or hypothesizing a statement of fact .",
    "the one encountered the most is gaussian noise , _",
    "e.g. _ the blackman - tukey window - smoothing procedure is associated with the hypothesis that the data are a realization of a stationary gaussian random process @xcite .",
    "of course there is nothing to prevent one from applying a procedure to any set of data no matter whether the hypothesis holds or not .",
    "moreover , using a different type of noise may have no serious impact when one wants merely to get a qualitative feature from the data studied .",
    "however , use of the wrong noise model is definitely not acceptable in forward methods for deconvolution when the potential function contains noise - related parameter(s ) .",
    "assigning a noise distribution different from real situation can be very costly , as pointed out by tukey _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "there remain further investigations to be done for the noise in dynamic sims profiles . changing the matrix composition may have effect on the mse and mean relation .",
    "it will also be interesting to see whether such a poissonian relation still holds when the experimental condition is further changed , such as using another element from a different type of source as the primary ion .",
