    "while describes large scale structures of the universe remarkably precise , einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) fails to give a consistent picture at certain space - time points , called singularity , where physical observables of the theory , such as energy density , become divergent .",
    "it is widely believed that the true cure of such physically meaningless states of gravity predicted by gr , lies out of the domain of validity of the theory ; it must be resolved in a regime in which both gravitational and quantum mechanical effects are dominant .",
    "various attempts to construct a consistent theory describing such a regime has been made among them loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite presents a clear picture of quantum space - time at planck scales in the kinematical level .",
    "the program rests on canonical quantization of gr expressed as an @xmath2 gauge theory on the 3 dimensional manifold @xmath3 of arbitrary topology , where a topology of space - time @xmath4 of the form @xmath5 is assumed , in a background independent manner . in such formulation of gr",
    ", the gravitational field is described by a pair of conjugate variables @xmath6 , where @xmath7 s notation in which indices @xmath8 denote space - time , @xmath9 3-space and @xmath10 @xmath11indices . ]",
    "is an @xmath2 connection and @xmath12 is the densitised triad vector field , conjugate to a :    @xmath13    with @xmath14 the gravitational constant and @xmath15 the immirzi parameter .",
    "the conjugate pair are constraint to satisfy the system @xmath16 } e^a_i e^b_j = 0 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are called gauss , spatial diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints respectively .",
    "in fact , the task of finding a metric satisfying the einstein s equations , describing configuration of a gravitating system , is now replaced by finding a conjugate pair @xmath6 satisfying the constraint system [ cconstraint ] .    on quantization ,",
    "one smears the basic fields @xmath6 to holonomies of @xmath17 along a curve @xmath15 , defined by @xmath18 = p \\left ( exp\\int_\\gamma a \\right)$ ] , and fluxes of @xmath19 through the surface @xmath20 , defined by @xmath21 .",
    "they form the holonomy - flux algebra in which holonomies act by multiplication , and fluxes act by derivation .    using a functional representation of quantum field theory and representing states as functionals of the cylindrical functions of holonomies , the kinematical hilbert space of the theory",
    "is constructed . after imposing gauss and diffeomorphism constraints as operators on such states ,",
    "the true gauge and diffeomorphism invariant states of the theory turns out to be spin networks acted upon by holonomies and fluxes operators which form a unique representation .",
    "more precisely , a spin network is a triplet @xmath22 consisting of a graph @xmath23 with nodes in @xmath3 , labeled by intertwiners @xmath24 , and links connecting different nodes , labeled by @xmath2 representations @xmath25 .",
    "the quantum geometrical picture suggested by lqg is manifest in quantization of geometrical observables , such as area and volume , as quantum operators acting on spin network states which result in discrete spectra and reflect the discrete nature of space - time .",
    "while the kinematical construction of the theory is well understood , the dynamics is still poorly under control .",
    "this can be investigated either within the spin foam formalism , a path integral analogue for time evolution of spin networks , or by studying solutions to the hamiltonian constraint , which requires criteria for choosing between different variants and orderings of the operator , and consequently building the dynamical hilbert space .    despite difficulties in solving the dynamics of the full theory ,",
    "different attempts have been made in studying simpler situations which would shed light on the path toward complete understanding of the theory .",
    "to study specific gravitational configurations characterized by specific macroscopic spatial symmetries , one should impose such symmetries suitably on the dynamical level of the quantum theory and find the true symmetric sector of the full theory . as for the hydrogen atom in quantum mechanics",
    ", for instance , one would investigate the full quantum mechanical description of the system only by finding states satisfying the suitable dynamical equation , spherically symmetric schrdinger equation , which form basis of the dynamical hilbert space .",
    "however , in lqg due to difficulties in solving hamiltonian constraint , one employs the symmetry reduction methods @xcite . in such models",
    "the desired symmetries are applied at classical level by choosing a symmetric pair @xmath26 satisfying constraints or it can be imposed at the kinematical level of the quantum theory .",
    "quantization of the symmetric pair will then be done which , evidently , gives rise to a simpler procedure than in full theory .",
    "this is in fact the idea of mini superspace which has been used extensively in quantum cosmology@xcite .    for the homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models ,",
    "loop quantum cosmology @xcite has led to remarkable results such as replacing big bang singularity with a big bounce @xcite , modification of fredmann equation @xcite and incorporation of an inflation mechanism @xcite . however , because of the reduction of degrees of freedom to a finite number , in fact one , the field theoretical aspects of the gravitation are lost ; since all points of space are equal , spin network just has one node .",
    "the same method has been applied to the schwarzschild black hole , since the interior region of such a black hole is a homogeneous space of kantowski - sachs type , and its singularity is shown to be resolved @xcite .    intuitively , singularity resolution occurs as a result of fundamental discreteness of space ; while in a classical continuum , divergences emerge as distance goes to zero , there is no room for divergences in quantum level since there is no zero distance below the planck length .",
    "put it slightly different , in the same manner quantum mechanical model for the hydrogen atom prevents a classical electron from collapsing to the nucleus , and hence energy divergence , by putting a lower bound on the spectrum of energy , quantum geometrical model put an upper bound on the classically divergent curvature components and prevents black holes from forming a singularity .",
    "in the spherically symmetric case , degrees of freedom of the theory can not be reduced to a finite number .",
    "instead , we are dealing with a midi - superspace having @xmath27 as the gauge group .",
    "this makes calculations simpler than the full theory while still respects the field theoretical aspects of spherically symmetric quantum gravity .    in this paper",
    ", we intend to study the quantum behavior of a reissner - nordstrm black hole . to this end , we employ spherically symmetric quantum geometry methods @xcite to quantize the interior portion of such a space - time within which the classical singularity occurs . in section 2 , we introduce the states and operators used in spherically symmetric quantum geometry .",
    "section 3 reviews the classical charged black hole metric , its horizons and singularity . and",
    "finally resolution of classical singularity will be discussed in section 4 .",
    "in this section , we outline the crucial points regarding the foundations and results of spherically symmetric quantum geometry developed by bojowald @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to the original articles for many technical subtleties which are omitted inevitably .",
    "viewing lqg as a method to quantize connections , one would be able to impose a symmetry through two avenues : ( i ) to pick , in the classical level , only those connections which are invariant under symmetry group action and consequently reduce the phase space , and ( ii ) to restrict the distributional states of the quantum theory , at the kinematical level , only to invariant connection .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that both methods just mentioned lead to the same result in the case of spherical symmetry .",
    "therefore , we proceed by describing the former - that of quantizing the classically reduced phase space .",
    "the manifold @xmath3 having the symmetry group @xmath20 with an isotropy subgroup @xmath28 , can be decomposed as @xmath29 .",
    "the connection can generally be written as @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath31 can be considered as the connection of the reduced theory and its holonomies along curves in @xmath32 can be quantized .    for the spherically symmetric case , @xmath33 , and the symmetry group is @xmath34 .",
    "this implies identifying @xmath32 with @xmath35 and the gauge group of the reduced theory @xmath28 with @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , reduced connections are @xmath27 gauge fields on @xmath35 .",
    "roughly speaking , spherical symmetry implies that our basic fields , in the spherical coordinate @xmath36 , are independent of angular variables .",
    "thus , the connection @xmath37 is just a function of the radial coordinate ; @xmath38 .",
    "the connections and triads of the reduced spherically symmetric phase space have the general form : @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the generators of @xmath42 algebra .",
    "they define the symplectic structure : @xmath43    however , a suitable canonical transformation can be made resulting in canonical variables @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 :    @xmath47    with @xmath48 being the @xmath49 component of the extrinsic curvature .",

    "that in terms of these variables , conjugate pair is not simply the connection - flux pair which suggests a different situation than the full theory .",
