    "the group @xmath0 plays an important role in various branches of physics .",
    "one is generally familiar with two ways of parametrizing the elements of @xmath0  the euler angle parametrization and the cayley - klein parametrization . in neither of these parametrizations",
    "is the expression for the group composition law particularly illuminating : there is no simple way of remembering or visualizing the composition law . hamilton@xcite , in the course of his studies on quaternions , developed an interesting geometric picture for representing the elements of @xmath0 wherein the group composition law acquires the structure of the familiar head to tail _ parallelogram rule _ of vector addition .",
    "this work has come to be known as _",
    "hamilton s theory of turns _ , and an excellent review can be found in the monograph of biedenharn and louck@xcite .",
    "interestingly , this elegant geometric picture does not seem to be as well known as it deserves , and it is only recently that hamilton s construction was generalized to the simplest noncompact semisimple lie group @xmath7@xcite",
    ".    the ideas underlying hamilton s construction can be best and most easily understood through analogy with the much simpler case of the abelian group of translations in a three dimensional euclidean space .",
    "each element of this group can be thought of as a unique point in a three dimensional space or , equivalently , as a vector emanating from the origin ",
    "the point representing the identity element .",
    "the composition law for this group then corresponds to simply adding vectors representing the group elements using the parallelogram law .",
    "examined in detail , the parallelogram law for the translation group involves giving up the picture in the last paragraph wherein each element of the group was represented by a vector with tail pegged to the origin , and going over to a picture based on free vectors  vectors with their tails unpegged .",
    "let @xmath8 represent the free vector with head at @xmath9 and tail at @xmath10 .",
    "the group element corresponding to translation by amount @xmath11 is represented not by a single free vector , but by the _ equivalence class _ of all free vectors @xmath12 obeying the only condition @xmath13 .",
    "the parallelogram law for composing two group elements @xmath8 and @xmath14 in this picture simply amounts to choosing representative free vectors , one from either equivalence class , in such a manner that the head of the first free vector coincides with the tail of the second .",
    "we may use , for instance , the equivalence @xmath15 .",
    "then the product of the two group elements is the free vector from the tail of the first to the head of the second vector : @xmath16    note that the equivalence class of free vectors corresponding to a group element is obtained from the unique vector pegged to the origin by the left action of the translation group .",
    "thus , the above construction can be carried over to any group @xmath17 through left action of the group on the group manifold itself .",
    "more precisely , to each group element @xmath18 one can associate an equivalence class of pairs @xmath19 , with the tail @xmath20 running over the entire group manifold .",
    "it can easily be verified that whatever was said about the translation group goes through here as well . in particular , composing two group elements @xmath21 represented by the equivalence classes corresponding respectively to @xmath19 and @xmath22 requires us to choose the representative pair from each equivalence class in such a manner that the head @xmath23 of the first one coincides with the tail of the second pair , @xmath24 , so that the resulting equivalence class @xmath25 corresponds to the group element @xmath26 , thus endowing the composition law of the arbitrary group @xmath17 with the structure of the parallelogram rule .",
    "this naive generalization of the parallelogram law applies uniformly to all groups , and does not take advantage of the specific features of a given group .",
    "it requires us to ascribe to each element of the group an equivalence class of pairs of points on the group manifold , and this equivalence class is exactly as large as the group manifold itself .",
    "thus , in the case of @xmath0 for which the group manifold is @xmath27 one would be associating with each group element an equivalence class of pairs of points on @xmath27 ( the tail point of a pair can be considered to be arbitrary , and the head point is then fixed by the tail and the group element under consideration ) .",
    "the importance of hamilton s work lies in his recognizing that formulation of the @xmath0 composition law as a parallelogram rule can be accomplished , with greater economy , using equivalence classes of pairs of points on @xmath1 rather than on @xmath27 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is that the latter is an adjoint orbit of the former . that the parallelogram law for composition of @xmath0 group elements can be constructed on the ( smaller ) adjoint orbit without having to resort to the full group manifold rests ultimately on the fact that @xmath0 is strongly nonabelian ( its centre is discrete ) . in comparison ,",
    "since the translation group of the @xmath28-dimensional euclidean space is abelian , parallelogram law for it can not be constructed in any space smaller than the group manifold @xmath29 .    just as @xmath0",
    ", the pseudo - unitary semisimple group @xmath7 , which is isomorphic to the real symplectic group @xmath30 of linear canonical transformations , plays an important role in several areas of physics like squeezed light , bogoliubov transformations , gaussian or first order optics , transmission lines , and reflection and transmission of classical and schrdinger waves at lossless boundaries and through barriers .",
    "further , @xmath7 is the double cover of the ( pseudo - orthogonal ) lorentz group @xmath3 of the @xmath31-dimensional space - time , a relationship similar to the one between @xmath0 and @xmath32 .",
    "another low dimensional group whose importance for physics can not be over - emphasised is the semisimple group @xmath4 .",
    "this group is the double ( and universal ) cover of the lorentz group @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the complex orthogonal group @xmath6 is isomorphic to @xmath5 : under a lorentz transformation the space - time coordinates transform as an @xmath5 vector , but the three components of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the electric and magnetic field vectors , transform as mutually conjugate @xmath6 vectors .",
    "as noted above , hamilton s theory of turns has already been generalized to @xmath7 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to develop a theory of turns for @xmath4 so that a geometric representation in the spirit of hamilton will be available for all the low dimensional semisimple lie groups of interest in physics .",
    "the contents of this paper are organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recount briefly hamilton s theory of turns for @xmath0 , and also its generalization to @xmath7 .",
    "this summary should prove useful in view of the fact that the theory of turns that we develop for @xmath4 runs almost parallel to that in the above cases .",
    "the adjoint orbits in the lie algebra of @xmath4 are considered in section 3 , and the relationships between the groups @xmath36 and @xmath4 are indicated . in section 4",
    "we construct turns for @xmath4 in the adjoint orbit of complex `` unit '' vectors @xmath37 , and demonstrate the parallelogram law for composition of turns .",
    "as an exercise in the use of turns , in section 5 we describe the polar decomposition in the language of turns .",
    "composition of lorentz boosts and the resulting wigner ( thomas ) rotation are studied in section 6 using turns .",
    "we conclude in section 7 with some final remarks .",
    "in the defining @xmath38 representation , elements of the group @xmath0 are described in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath39 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a real scalar and @xmath11 is a real three vector satisfying the constraint @xmath42 thus the group manifold of @xmath0 is the unit sphere @xmath27 .",
    "the centre of @xmath0 is @xmath43 , the subgroup consisting of the two elements @xmath44 .",
    "the lie algebra considered as a linear space coincides with @xmath45 , and it consists of all traceless hermitian matrices @xmath46 .",
    "the group @xmath0 , modulo its center @xmath43 , can be realized by its adjoint action on its lie algebra : @xmath47 thus @xmath48 is invariant , and hence the adjoint orbits of @xmath0 are spheres centred at the origin .",
    "hamilton s turns can be constructed on any of these orbits , and we choose the unit sphere @xmath1 .",
    "the construction goes as follows .",
    "given @xmath49 , choose a pair of unit vectors @xmath50 such that @xmath51 .",
    "this is always possible and , indeed , there exists not just one choice but an equivalence class of choices .",
    "when @xmath52 , the unit vectors @xmath53 are necessarily orthogonal to @xmath11 , and there exists a one parameter worth of freedom in the choice of @xmath53 : for instance , @xmath54 can be chosen to be an arbitrary point on the great circle of @xmath1 perpendicular to @xmath11 , and then @xmath55 is uniquely determined by @xmath56 and @xmath57 . on the other hand , when @xmath58 , i.e. when @xmath59 , the vectors @xmath53 are necessarily parallel or antiparallel , and there is a two parameter worth of freedom in choosing the pair ( @xmath54 may be chosen to be an arbitrary point , and then @xmath55 is fixed : @xmath60 ) .",
    "we may use @xmath53 to label the elements of @xmath0 and write @xmath61 this equation describes a one - to - one correspondence between elements of @xmath0 and equivalence classes of pairs of points in @xmath1 .",
    "now , a pair of points in @xmath1 is the same thing as a directed great circle arc with tail at the first member of the pair and head at the second .",
    "thus emerges the one - to - one correspondence between elements of @xmath0 and equivalence classes of directed great circle ( geodesic ) arcs . _",
    "these equivalence classes are the turns of hamilton_. arcs of an equivalence class belong to the same great circle , have the same sense and same arc length @xmath62 , so that the members of an equivalence class are obtained by rigidly sliding one arc of the class along its own geodesic .",
    "the element @xmath63 corresponds to the equivalence class of great semicircles or antipodal points , and the identity element to the equivalence class of null arcs or singleton points .    since @xmath64",
    ", we have @xmath65 .",
    "that is , the @xmath0 inverse of a turn corresponds simply to reversal of the sense of the turn .",
    "the group composition law rests on the identity @xmath66 which follows from the definition ( 2.4 ) .",
    "this is the parallelogram law for the product of two @xmath0 elements when the tail of the left factor coincides with `` and cancels '' the head of the right factor at @xmath55 .",
    "the product then corresponds to the directed great circle arc from the free tail @xmath54 to the free head @xmath67 , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "that it is always possible , given two arbitrary elements of @xmath0 , to choose directed arcs from the respective turns so that the tail of the left element coincides with the head of the right element is guaranteed by the fact that great circles on @xmath1 intersect ( or coincide ) .",
    "thus , the parallelogram law ( 2.5 ) faithfully reproduces @xmath0 multiplication ( including its noncommutativity ! ) .",
    "given @xmath68 , the condition @xmath69 implies that we can find a unit vector @xmath70 and an angle @xmath71 such that @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "thus , we may also parametrize the elements of @xmath0 as @xmath74 rendering the fact that @xmath27 , the group manifold of @xmath0 , is a @xmath75 bundle over @xmath1 . in the adjoint representation",
    "@xmath76 acts as rotation through angle @xmath77 about the direction @xmath70 .",
    "while the unit vectors @xmath78 in ( 2.4 ) live in the `` equator '' orthogonal to @xmath70 , the angle between them is @xmath79 and not @xmath77 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    this concludes our account of hamilton s theory of turns for @xmath0 .",
    "we have gone over it in some detail , for the theory of turns that we shall develop for the lorentz group will follow the @xmath0 case quite closely .",
    "the theory of turns has turned out to be a powerful tool in connexion with several synthesis problems in polarization optics@xcite . a particularly striking result in this context",
    "is the following : _ every intensity preserving _",
    "[ i.e. , @xmath0 ] _ transformation in polarization optics can be synthesised with just two quarter wave plates and one half wave plate_@xcite .",
    "moreover , an intimate connection between @xmath0 turns and the berry - pancharatnam@xcite geometric phase has been established@xcite .",
    "hamilton s theory of turns has been generalized to the noncompact group @xmath7 only recently@xcite .",
    "this group consists of two dimensional complex pseudounitary matrices of unit determinant : @xmath81 it order to maintain a close similarity with the group @xmath0 , it proves convenient to define @xmath82 and to introduce the @xmath83-minkowskian analogues ( with indices running over 1,2,3 rather than over 0,1,2 ) of the scalar and the cross products of vectors as follows @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the metric , and @xmath86 is the levi - civita symbol with @xmath87 . with the help of this notation @xmath7 matrices , in analogy with the @xmath0 case",
    ", can be expressed as @xmath88 where the scalar @xmath89 and the vector @xmath90 are real and are constrained by @xmath91 the group manifold of @xmath7 is the hyperboloid described by ( 2.10 ) .",
    "topologically it has the same structure as @xmath92 , as can be seen by solving for @xmath89 and @xmath93 in ( 2.10 ) in terms of @xmath94 and an angle variable @xmath77 : @xmath95 thus , the group manifold of @xmath7 is noncompact .",
    "it is multiply connected , while that of the compact group @xmath0 is simply connected .",
    "however , the centre of @xmath7 is @xmath43 , the subgroup consisting of the two elements @xmath44 , just as with @xmath0 .",
    "the lie algebra of @xmath7 consists of the matrices @xmath96 .",
    "adjoint action of @xmath7 on its lie algebra gives a realization of @xmath7 modulo its center @xmath43 : @xmath97 we made use of the fact that @xmath98 is invariant under conjugation    whereas all the adjoint orbits of @xmath0 were of the same type , namely concentric spheres , in the @xmath7 case there are different types of orbits since , owing to the indefinite nature of the minkowskian scalar product , the invariant @xmath99 can be positive , negative , or zero ( adjoint orbits of the orthogonal and pseudo - orthogonal groups @xmath100 , have been analysed and classified in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the single sheeted unit hyperboloid consisting of spacelike unit vectors @xmath10 with @xmath101 proves convenient@xcite in generalizing hamilton s theory of turns to @xmath7 .",
    "indeed , the construction proceeds in close analogy with the @xmath0 case , and the details can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "the group @xmath4 in its defining representation consists of complex valued @xmath38 matrices of unit determinant : @xmath102 it is a noncompact six parameter real lie group .",

    "the superscript over @xmath108 is to remind us that we are dealing with the complex , rather than the real , orthogonal group , and @xmath109 is to be viewed as a column vector .    for any lie group @xmath17 with centre @xmath110",
    ", the adjoint representation is a faithful representation of the quotient group @xmath111 . in the cases of @xmath0 and @xmath7 we have seen that the adjoint representations coincide respectively with the defining representations of @xmath32 and @xmath3 , consistent with the fact that @xmath112 . in the case of @xmath4",
    "we find that the adjoint representation coincides with the defining representation of the complex orthogonal group @xmath6 , with the complex @xmath113 matrices of the latter rewritten as real @xmath114 matrices in a natural manner .",

    "the adjoint orbits@xcite of the lie algebra of @xmath4 can be easily figured out from the fact that @xmath142 is the only ( complex ) invariant associated with a generic lie algebra element @xmath143 under the adjoint action . since @xmath142 can assume any numerical value , it is clear that there exists precisely one orbit for each point in the complex plane .",

    "thus the type - i orbits have the structure of the four dimensional manifold @xmath149 , and there exists precisely one such orbit for every nonzero complex number .",

    "thus the type - ii orbit has the structure of the four dimensional manifold @xmath155 .",
    "both @xmath156 and @xmath157 are abelian . at the risk of repetition we wish to note that there exists only one type - ii orbit .    to construct turns for @xmath4",
    "we shall make use of the orbit @xmath158 .",
    "we shall denote this orbit by @xmath159 , and refer to it as _ the orbit of complex unit vectors_. for convenience , elements of @xmath159 will be decorated with a hat , like @xmath160    to conclude this section , we note that the vector algebra in @xmath161 carries over to @xmath162 with virtually no change .",
    "in particular , the following familiar identities are true for complex - valued vectors as well : @xmath163 these relations will be found useful in the next section .",
    "we now have all the ingredients to construct a theory of turns for @xmath4 . elements of @xmath4 can be described through @xmath164 where @xmath41 is a complex scalar and @xmath11 a complex three vector subject to the condition @xmath165 .",
    "this is one complex condition on four complex numbers .",
    "given @xmath166 , to construct the turn corresponding to @xmath167 we look for pairs of complex unit vectors @xmath53 such that @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "let @xmath54 be a unit vector perpendicular to @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath170 .",
    "this corresponds to two real constraints in the four - parameter manifold of unit vectors .",

    "define @xmath171 then @xmath165 guarantees that @xmath172 , and we may indeed write @xmath55 in place of @xmath9 .",
    "further , it can be verified that the conditions @xmath173 and @xmath174 are satisfied . since there is a two - parameter worth of freedom in the choice of @xmath54 , we have not just one pair but an equivalence class of pairs @xmath175 representing a given @xmath120 .",
    "we may use any one of these pairs and write @xmath176 and call the equivalence class @xmath177 as the turn from the tail @xmath54 to the head @xmath55 .",
    "( the improper use of a common symbol @xmath178 at the start and the end of this equation should cause no confusion . )",
    "conversely , for any choice of two complex unit vectors @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath179 is indeed an @xmath4 element , and two pairs @xmath180 and @xmath181 are in the same equivalence class if and only if @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "for the special elements @xmath184 , we have @xmath185 and hence @xmath186 .    since @xmath187",
    ", it follows that @xmath188 thus the inverse corresponds to reversing the sense of the turn , as one would have wished .",
    "only the parallelogram law of composition remains to be established .    with the aid of the identities ( 3.14 )",
    ", it is readily seen that the definition ( 4.3 ) possesses the following property : @xmath189 this is the parallelogram law when the head of the right factor coincides with the tail of the left one .",
    "the theory of turns for @xmath4 will be deemed complete if one can show that there always exists a common unit vector @xmath67 where two turns meet .",
    "suppose @xmath190 and @xmath191 are two @xmath4 elements , then the common unit vector @xmath67 where the corresponding turns meet should necessarily satisfy @xmath192 and @xmath193 . thus @xmath67 must be a multiple of @xmath194 .",
    "it follows that a unit vector @xmath67 common to two turns exists if and only if @xmath195 .",
    "thus , if the two @xmath4 elements to be composed are such that @xmath196 , then their turns meet in the space of unit vectors @xmath159 , and ( 4.5 ) constitutes the parallelogram law of composition for such pairs .",
    "but if @xmath197 , the corresponding turns do not meet in @xmath159 , and hence further work is needed before ( 4.5 ) can be used as the parallelogram law of composition for such pairs .",
    "fortunately , the latter situation occurs only in a measure zero set of cases : @xmath198 can take any complex value , but the turns fail to meet in @xmath159 only when this value is zero .    in such special cases",
    "one may infinitesimally modify one of the two @xmath4 elements to be composed , say change @xmath199 to @xmath200 so that @xmath201 and @xmath202 are infinitesimals and @xmath203 , use ( 4.5 ) to compose the turns , and take the limit of the composed turn as the infinitesimals go to zero .",
    "alternatively , we may suitably factorize @xmath199 into a product of two @xmath204 elements , @xmath205 , and use the parallelogram law twice : compose the turn corresponding to @xmath167 with that corresponding to @xmath200 , and then compose the resulting turn with that corresponding to @xmath206 ( this latter approach is the one used in the theory of turns for @xmath7 presented in ref.@xcite for handling turns which do not meet ) .    with these provisions for handling the measure zero case of nonintersecting turns , ( 4.5 ) constitutes the parallelogram law of composition for @xmath4 turns .",
    "in this section we describe in the language of turns we have just developed the process of polar decomposition .",
    "such an exercise not only helps us in developing a feel for @xmath4 turns , but also helps in the study of composition of lorentz boosts to be taken up in the next section .",
    "any element @xmath207 can be decomposed as @xmath208 , where @xmath123 is hermitian positive definite , @xmath209 is unitary , and therefore @xmath210 .",
    "this polar decomposition is unique for a given @xmath211 , and corresponds to the decomposition of an element @xmath212 into a spatial rotation followed by a boost .",
    "that is , @xmath213 where @xmath214 is real symmetric positive definite and @xmath108 is orthogonal .",
    "again , @xmath214 and @xmath108 are uniquely determined in terms of @xmath215 , and both factors are elements of @xmath5 . in @xmath6 ,",
    "this decomposition corresponds to a rotation through a purely real angle followed by a rotation through a purely imaginary angle .",
    "it is important to appreciate that polar decomposition is not covariant under conjugation by @xmath4 [ equivalently , by @xmath5 or @xmath216 .",
    "it is covariant only under @xmath0 [ equivalently , under @xmath32 ] .",
    "now an element @xmath218 is unitary ( real rotation ) if and only if @xmath41 and @xmath11 are real . in the language of",
    "turns this translates into the following statement : @xmath219 is unitary if and only if @xmath54 and @xmath55 are real .",
    "similarly @xmath220 is hermitian positive definite ( pure boost ) if and only if @xmath41 is real and @xmath221 and @xmath11 is imaginary . in terms of turns",
    "this happens if one member of the pair @xmath222,@xmath223 , say @xmath54 , is purely real to which the real part of the other , say @xmath55 , is parallel ( not antiparallel ) .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath55 is then perpendicular to @xmath54 by virtue of the fact that the real and imaginary parts of a complex unit vector are necessarily orthogonal .    writing @xmath224 , polar decomposition of @xmath225 is trivial when @xmath226 and @xmath227 , the real and imaginary parts of @xmath11 , are multiples of one another .",
    "so we assume that @xmath228 and @xmath227 are linearly independent .",
    "our aim is to decompose @xmath229 in the polar form @xmath230 with @xmath231 real so that @xmath232 will be an element of @xmath0 ( i.e. , rotation ) and the real part of @xmath55 parallel to @xmath67 so that @xmath233 will be hermitian positive definite ( i.e. , pure boost ) .",
    "we noted in section iv that there exists a two parameter worth of freedom in choosing the tail point @xmath54 of a turn @xmath234 . to facilitate polar decomposition we need to choose @xmath54 to be real , and the above two parameter freedom permits such a choice .",
    "indeed , reality of @xmath54 and the requirement @xmath235 , which follows from @xmath236 , together imply that @xmath54 is necessarily orthogonal to both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath224 : @xmath237 then , from ( 4.2 ) , @xmath238 where @xmath239 and @xmath240 are respectively the real and imaginary parts of the scalar @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath67 has to be real and parallel ( not antiparallel ) to the real part of @xmath55 , we have @xmath241 and the polar decomposition is completed .",
    "reality of @xmath54 required by polar decomposition removed the two parameter worth of arbitrariness or freedom in the choice of @xmath54 , and hence in that of @xmath67 and @xmath242 , except for a signature in ( 5.2 ) .",
    "since @xmath55 and @xmath67 in ( 5.3 ) , ( 5.4 ) are linear in @xmath54 , and since the quantities entering the polar decomposition are quadratic in @xmath53 and @xmath67 , either choice for the signature in ( 5.2 ) leads to the same set of expressions , confirming the uniqueness of the polar decomposition : @xmath243 we have @xmath244 by virtue of the fact that for a complex unit vector the square of the norm of the real part exceeds unity by an amount equal to the square of the norm of the imaginary part .",
    "let us define a real angle @xmath245 and real unit vector @xmath246 through @xmath247 these expressions remain invariant under the transformation @xmath248 , and hence we restrict the range of @xmath245 to @xmath249 .",
    "similarly , let us define a real positive rapidity parameter @xmath250 and a real unit vector @xmath251 through @xmath252 with these definitions the polar decomposition ( 3.5 ) can be written as @xmath253 the hyperbolic factor is manifestly hermitian positive definite with eigenvalues @xmath254 , and corresponds to a boost along the spatial direction @xmath255 with rapidity parameter @xmath250 .",
    "the trigonometric factor is manifestly unitary and corresponds to spatial rotation by angle @xmath245 about the direction @xmath256 .",
    "the suffix @xmath257/@xmath258 attached to @xmath259 signifies boost / rotation . comparing ( 5.6 ) ,",
    "( 5.7 ) with ( 5.5 ) we deduce that @xmath260 and that the spatial rotation is about the direction of @xmath261 , while the boost is along the spatial direction @xmath262 .    in concluding this section we wish to make the following remark .",
    "since the set of all @xmath263 hermitian positive definite @xmath4 matrices @xmath264 has the structure of @xmath45 as a manifold , and since @xmath0 has the structure of @xmath27 , it follows from the uniqueness of the polar decomposition that the @xmath4 group manifold has the structure of @xmath265 . in the case of @xmath266 $ ] , the role of @xmath27 will be played by the real projective space @xmath267 , consistent with the relation @xmath268 .",
    "as our second and final illustration of the theory of turns we have developed for the lorentz group , we apply it to the well known problem of composition of lorentz boosts .",
    "let the first boost be in the spatial direction of the real unit vecor @xmath269 , with rapidity parameter @xmath270 , and let the second be in the direction of @xmath70 , with rapidity parameter @xmath271 .",
    "the problem of composition of boosts is trivial when @xmath269 and @xmath70 are parallel or antiparallel to one another , and so we assume @xmath269 and @xmath70 to be linearly independent .",
    "let @xmath272 and @xmath273 be the turns corresponding to the two boosts . then @xmath274 let @xmath67 be the point where the head of the first turn and the tail of the second turn meet ( it turns out that @xmath67 is necessarily real )",
    ". since the pair @xmath275 is orthogonal to @xmath269 while the pair @xmath276 is orthogonal to @xmath70 , the common meeting point @xmath67 has to be necessarily orthogonal to both @xmath269 and @xmath70 : @xmath277 let @xmath54 be the tail of the first turn and @xmath55 be the head of the second turn when they so meet at @xmath67 , so that the first boost can be represented by @xmath278 and the second by @xmath279 .",
    "that is , @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
    "solving for @xmath53 we have , @xmath282 we conclude from the parallelogram law ( 4.5 ) that the product of the @xmath269 boost followed by the @xmath70 boost is @xmath283    to gain insight into the product @xmath284 , let us write it in the form @xmath285 , where @xmath286 use of ( 6.3 ) yields the following expressions for the real and imaginary parts of @xmath287 : @xmath288 the vector parameter @xmath11 in ( 6.6 ) determining the product of the @xmath269 and @xmath70 boosts is complex , as was to be expected , since the product of two lorentz boosts in neither a ( pure ) boost nor a spatial rotation .",
    "we may now apply the polar decomposition developed in the last section to the product of the two boosts : @xmath289 where we require @xmath290 to correspond to a boost and @xmath291 to a spatial rotation , and @xmath292 are given by ( 6.6 ) .",
    "the spatial rotation so obtained is known as the _ wigner _ or _",
    "thomas rotation_@xcite .",
    "it follows from ( 5.5 ) and ( 6.6 ) that the wigner rotation @xmath293 is about the direction @xmath294 . that is , the wigner rotation is in the plane spanned by @xmath269 and @xmath70 .",
    "let @xmath245 be the magnitude of the wigner rotation .",
    "then from ( 5.9 ) we have @xmath295 where @xmath296 , and @xmath77 is the angle between @xmath269 and @xmath70 .    having computed the wigner rotation part , we now examine the boost part @xmath290 .",
    "let @xmath297 denote the rapidity parameter for this boost .",
    "then one finds from ( 5.9 )",
    "@xmath298 further , it follows from ( 5.5 ) and ( 6.6 ) that this resultant boost is in the direction of @xmath299 thus the resultant boost is about a direction in the plane spanned by @xmath269 and @xmath70 .",
    "if @xmath300 is the angle between the resultant boost and @xmath70 , one finds that @xmath301 thus the product of two lorentz boosts of rapidity parameters @xmath302 and spatial directions @xmath303 is a wigner rotation of amount @xmath245 in the plane spanned by @xmath303 followed by a lorentz boost of rapidity parameter @xmath297 along the direction that lies in the plane spanned by @xmath303 and makes an angle @xmath300 with @xmath70 .",
    "the expressions for @xmath304 and @xmath300 derived using turns are consistent with known results@xcite , but our aim of this exercise was simply to illustrate the theory of turns we have developed for the lorentz group .",
    "we have examined in detail the ideas underlying hamilton s theory of turns for @xmath0 , in a manner that paves the way to developing a similar geometrical construction for other groups . after a brief review of the theories of turns for @xmath0 and @xmath7",
    ", we worked out a theory of turns for the group @xmath4 .",
    "formulae for the polar decomposition of an @xmath4 element were derived within the framework of the theory of turns developed here , and were put to use to compose lorentz boosts and to calculate the resulting wigner rotation .",
    "these exercises , carried out for illustration of the geometric construction , led to acceptable results .",
    "decomposition of an arbitrary element of the lorentz group in the form spatial rotation  followed by boost in a fixed direction  followed by spatial rotation can be analysed in a similar manner using turns .",
    "it is gratifying to note that , with our earlier generalization@xcite of the theory of turns to @xmath305 , the present generalization renders a geometric representation in the spirit of hamilton available to all low dimensional simple lie groups of interest in physics .",
    "the geometry of turns for @xmath0 is applicable to any problem that involves the group @xmath0 .",
    "two - level systems constitute an important class of such problems , but not the only ones .",
    "as remarked earlier , the theory of turns has led to the formulation and solution of important sythesis problems in these contexts@xcite .",
    "for instance , we have the result that _ all _ linear intensity preserving transformations of polarization optics can be synthesised using just two quarterwave plates and one halfwave plate@xcite . notwithstanding its wording , this result is applicable not only to polarization optics , but also to other systems involving @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , in the case of nuclear magnetic resonance @xmath306 and @xmath307-pulses will correspond respectively to the same @xmath0 transformations as quarter and halfwave plates in polarization optics .",
    "( these are respectively the eighth and fourth symmetric roots of the unit matrix . ) and hence the above result in this context will read : any unitary evolution ( @xmath308 transformation ) of a spin half system can be achieved using two @xmath306 pulses and one @xmath307 pulse .",
    "further , the theory of @xmath0 turns has helped to clarify the deep relationship between the structure of this group and geometric phase in two - level systems@xcite .",
    "it should be of interest to carry out similar geometric studies for the lorentz group using the theory developed here .    in this work",
    "we have restricted ourselves to simply demonstrating that a consistent theory of turns is possible for the lorentz group .",
    "the applications considered served the limited purpose of showing the effectiveness of the theory .",
    "more elaboration will , of course , be needed to handle the questions raised in the last paragraph , and we plan to return to these and other issues elsewhere .",
