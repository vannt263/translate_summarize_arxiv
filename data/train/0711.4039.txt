    "pulsar glitches are characterised by a step increase in the pulsar s rotation frequency .",
    "the mechanisms responsible for pulsar glitches are unclear but there are two main candidates to explain the underlying process . for older pulsars",
    "it seems glitches are likely caused by a dramatic decoupling between the star s solid crust and superfluid interior  @xcite while glitches in younger pulsars may be associated with reconfigurations of the crust as spin - down reduces the centrifugal force and the crust reaches breaking strain  @xcite . in either case , the disruption should excite oscillatory modes throughout the neutron star .",
    "the excitation of quadrupolar quasinormal modes in a neutron star leads to the emission of a short , distinctive burst of gravitational radiation in the form of a decaying sinusoid , or ` ring - down '  @xcite , with typical frequencies and decay times in the range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "in @xcite we present a search method based on bayesian model selection where the evidence for a ring - down signal is compared with the evidence for a noise model , taken to be gaussian white noise for simplicity . in this work",
    "we review this approach and demonstrate how it may be modified to cluster odds ratios computed from power spectral densities in the time - signal frequency plane .",
    "in essence , we use the frequency posterior from the most probable event in a cluster to set a prior to compute the odds ratios in adjacent time - frequency pixels .",
    "given some data @xmath2 , a model @xmath3 and some background information @xmath4 , representing some prior knowledge of the system , we can write down the posterior probability for the model using bayes theorem ,    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the prior probability of the model , @xmath7 is the likelihood or _ evidence _ of the model @xmath3 and @xmath8 is the probability of the data .",
    "we are free to assign any suitable prior for the model and the model likelihood or _ evidence _ is computed by marginalising the likelihood of the data over all of the model parameters , @xmath9 ,    @xmath10    we wish to address the question , ` does the data @xmath2 contain a ring - down gravitational wave or is the data simply gaussian white noise ? ' .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the model that the data contains a ring - down signal @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the model that the data contains only noise .",
    "we then write down the ` odds ratio ' @xmath14 which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities for each model ,    @xmath15    substituting bayes theorem ( equation [ eq : bayes ] ) for the posteriors , we see that the odds ratio may be divided into a term independent of the data , ( the _ prior odds _ ) and a term dependent on the data ( the _ bayes factor _ ) :    @xmath16    in practice , the prior odds can be assigned by computing the bayes factor ( i.e. , evidence ratio ) in some sample of data away from the pulsar glitch trigger .",
    "if the prior odds are then set equal to the reciprocal of this off - source bayes factor , the odds ratio in the on - source data will rise above unity when there is greater evidence for a ring - down than there was in the off - source data .",
    "however , it is necessary to set a higher threshold than unity to claim a detection since @xmath17 simply indicates no preference for either model .",
    "the threshold required for a given level of confidence is determined empirically through simulated signal injections .",
    "this is demonstrated and explored in more detail in @xcite and we do not consider the issue here .    to demonstrate the detection process we inject 10 ring - down waveforms with randomly chosen frequencies in the range @xmath18 to @xmath19 , decay time @xmath20 and initial amplitude @xmath21 into @xmath22 of synthetic gaussian white noise with amplitude spectral density @xmath23 .",
    "the spectrogram in the left panel of figure  [ fig : injectogram ] shows the injected signals in the time - frequency plane .",
    "the odds ratio @xmath14 in each time bin of the spectrogram is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : injectogram ] .",
    "the prior odds in this example are computed from sythetic gaussian white noise with no injections .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "in these proceedings we have given a brief overview of the model selection technique for gravitational wave detection introduced in @xcite .",
    "we have expanded on the original work and introduced a simple clustering algorithm which only associates a single odds value with a single signal .",
    "this is an improvement over the original work where overlap between fourier transform time segments could potentially result in multiple ` detections ' for a single signal .",
    "further , the posterior frequency information from time bins where the odds ratio crosses some detection threshold is used to construct a new prior for computing the odds ratio in adjacent time bins .",
    "if this secondary odds ratio crosses its respective threshold , we compute the joint probability in favour of a signal across several time bins .",
    "it should be noted that we do not consider any kind of sensitivity or performance estimate in this work as we wish only to highlight a potential approach .",
    "furthermore , the computation of a joint probability between overlapping time bins should formally account for correlations .",
    "we will consider these factors in future work and in the application to real gravitational wave data ."
