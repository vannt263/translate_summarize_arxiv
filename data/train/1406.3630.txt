    "cosmic synchrotron sources , such as jets in active galactic nuclei , radio halos and relics in clusters of galaxies , pulsar - wind nebulae , and shell supernova remnants ( snrs ) , demonstrate the ubiquity of power - law distributions of relativistic electrons .",
    "understanding the origins of these fast particles is necessary to learn about these objects energy budgets and evolution .",
    "the synchrotron flux density emitted by a source depends roughly on the product of the energy density of relativistic electrons @xmath7 and the magnetic field @xmath8 , but an independent determination of magnetic - field strengths in synchrotron sources has proven elusive . the minimum energy of a synchrotron source occurs when the two energy densities are roughly equal ( `` equipartition ; '' actually , @xmath9 ; e.g. , pacholczyk 1970 ) . however , it is not clear whether the unseen population of relativistic protons should also be included , and if so , what the proton - to - electron energy ratio should be .",
    "furthermore , there is no obvious physical reason to expect equipartition .",
    "the argument for equipartition derives from attempts to explain extragalactic radio sources in which the total energy budget is so large that it was of interest to find a lower bound ( burbidge 1956 ) .",
    "however , many other synchrotron sources , including snrs , release a relatively small fraction of their total energy content as synchrotron emission , so could easily afford to be far from equipartition ( in either direction ) .",
    "although magnetic fields are not dynamically important in snrs ( e.g. , jun & jones 1999 ) , their strength is critical in determining the maximum energy to which particles can be accelerated . for the diffusive shock acceleration process ( dsa ; e.g. , blandford @xmath10 eichler 1987 ) , the time @xmath11 to accelerate particles to energy @xmath12 depends on the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 and the shock velocity @xmath13 by @xmath14 . for relativistic particles , @xmath15 . then in `` bohm - like '' diffusion , where the mean free path @xmath16 is assumed proportional to the particle gyroradius ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 , and higher magnetic fields result in more rapid acceleration and higher maximum energies .",
    "this is independent of which of several competing mechanisms ultimately limits acceleration ( finite time since onset of acceleration , radiative losses , or escape ) .",
    "note that for the above description of the diffusion coefficient , taking @xmath19 is called bohm diffusion or the `` bohm limit . ''",
    "it corresponds to @xmath20 , often assumed to be the shortest physically plausible mean free path .",
    "however , in a turbulent wave field , it is not clear whether this is a true limit , or even what kind of average value for the magnetic - field strength should be used to calculate @xmath21 ( e.g. , reville & bell 2013 ) .    largely by exclusion of competing hypotheses ,",
    "galactic cosmic ray acceleration is now widely attributed to snr shocks .",
    "the consensus is that snrs can accelerate particles up to the `` knee , '' the slight inflection and steepening around 3 pev ( @xmath22 ev ) .",
    "( no plausible version of snr - based dsa produces the maximum energies observed in cosmic rays of above @xmath23 ev [ e.g. , abraham et al .",
    "2008 ] , for which an extragalactic origin is presumed . ) however , since the work of lagage & cesarsky ( 1983 ) , it has been clear that typical estimates of magnetic - field strengths behind snr shocks of a few @xmath24gauss ( the mean interstellar magnetic field multiplied by the shock compression ratio , @xmath25 , taken to be 4 for strong nonrelativistic shocks ) , result in maximum energies that fall short of the `` knee '' by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "these estimates of @xmath26 are based on measurements of the interstellar magnetic field strength within a few kpc of the sun , which is about 2  3 @xmath24gauss ( lyne & smith 1989 ) .",
    "simple compression in a strong shock with adiabatic index @xmath27 ( i.e. , unmodified by cosmic rays ) would produce downstream values larger by a factor of up to 4 ( no amplification if the shock velocity is parallel to the field , a factor of 4 increase if perpendicular ) .",
    "thus magnetic fields larger than about 12 @xmath24gauss require an additional process of amplification .",
    "independent methods of estimating interstellar magnetic - field strengths , such as zeeman splitting in molecular lines , are not relevant to snr environments .",
    "thus the plausibility of models in which snr shocks produce galactic cosmic rays up to the `` knee '' may depend on observational determinations of the post - shock magnetic field strength .",
    "fortunately , the realization that young snrs can produce synchrotron emission into the x - ray band has made available a new , potentially powerful method for such determinations .",
    "several young snrs show thin ( a very small fraction of their diameter ) , synchrotron - emitting filaments along their edges .",
    "the widths of these rims in the radial direction have been used to infer estimates for the post - shock magnetic field strength and presented as evidence for significant magnetic field amplification by strong shocks , as we shall review in detail below .",
    "the complexity of the calculations used to infer the magnetic field magnitude varies significantly from simple analytic approximations to detailed numerical calculations , but the consensus from these studies is that field amplification well beyond a factor of four is required to explain the x - ray observations .",
    "thin synchrotron rims present a well - defined problem . while synchrotron emissivity may suddenly turn on at the shock front due to particle acceleration and magnetic - field compression ( or amplification ) there , turning it off again only about a tenth of a parsec downstream",
    "is not so simple : one must either eliminate the radiating particles or the magnetic field .",
    "both possibilities have been suggested .",
    "radiative energy losses as particles advect and diffuse downstream will eventually lower electron energies below the level at which synchrotron x - rays can be produced . more rapid synchrotron losses for",
    "higher electron energies then predict that rims will become thinner at higher photon energies .",
    "however , it is also possible that magnetic fields somehow decay behind the shock , with a length scale ( almost ) independent of electron energy , predicting rims whose thickness is relatively constant with photon energy .    in the energy - loss scenario ,",
    "the rate at which rims become thinner as observing energy rises depends on electron transport .",
    "if electrons are simply advected downstream , rim widths @xmath28 depend only on the magnetic - field strength , and drop quite rapidly with increasing photon energy , @xmath29 in the simplest approximation , as we describe below",
    ". however , diffusion allows electrons of the same energy to spread out spatially , diluting this effect somewhat and predicting slower drops in rim widths with energy . measuring the rim widths at several different photon energies",
    "is thus key to discriminating among models .",
    "the remnant of the type ia supernova of ad 1006 is well suited for this analysis , as its large angular size coupled with _",
    "chandra _ s high spatial resolution allows accurate measurements of radial profiles of the filaments : the remnant radius of about @xmath30 corresponds to over 1800 _ chandra _ acis pixels .",
    "furthermore , the shock speeds in the synchrotron - dominated northeast ( ne ) and southwest ( sw ) edges are about 5000 km s@xmath31 , as measured from their proper motion ( katsuda et al",
    ".  2009 , winkler et al .  2014 ) , and the snr has been detected as a tev source ( acero et al .",
    "2010 ) , suggesting that sn1006 produces very high - energy cosmic rays .",
    "our purpose here is to consider theories of particle diffusion and magnetic - field amplification in the light of new deep observations of sn1006 made with _",
    "chandra_. in section 2 ( summarized in table  [ tab : rev ] ) , we review earlier work on filament calculations and the evidence for field amplification to establish a firm background for the new work presented here . in section 3 , we generalize previous work by allowing different energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient from bohm - like , including kolmogorov and kraichnan - type diffusion , among others .",
    "we first neglect any cut - off in the electron spectrum and calculate model profiles and their energy dependence for the loss - limited ( section 3.1 ) and magnetically damped ( section 3.2 ) scenarios .",
    "we then add the effects of an electron cut - off energy ( section 3.3 ) , and examine the effects of making the @xmath32-function approximation for the emissivity ( section 3.4 ) . in section 4 ,",
    "we describe measurements of the widths of the nonthermal filaments in sn1006 , including for the first time the sw region , making use of new high - resolution _ chandra _ measurements .",
    "we find that rim widths decrease with increasing photon energy , quite rapidly in some cases .",
    "we use these measurements to constrain both the post - shock magnetic field and diffusion coefficient .",
    "the general narrowing of rims eliminates the magnetic - damping model for rim widths ; quantitatively , we find values of post - shock magnetic field of 70  200 @xmath24 g , comparable to those obtained in earlier work . however , the rapidity of rim shrinkage suggests that diffusion mean free paths in some areas are quite small , perhaps less than the gyroradius .",
    "we discuss these results in section 5 , including reviewing theoretical and observational work on sub - bohm diffusion and implications for particle acceleration to high energies .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "finally , in the appendix , we offer a list of the results of our experience in applying the various rim models to observations , as a guide for potential future investigations .",
    "prior work bifurcates into two eras , an earlier one in which it was assumed that the only influence on filament shapes was synchrotron losses , followed by one beginning in 2005 when additional effects such as magnetic field damping began to be introduced .",
    "we consider first the former case ; decay of magnetic field is considered in section 2.2 .      before 2005",
    ", it was universally assumed that the shapes of nonthermal x - ray filaments observed in snrs were due to synchrotron losses by high energy electrons ( see the many references described below and in table  [ tab : rev ] ) .",
    "the idea was that an electron could only travel a certain distance before losing enough energy that its radiation dropped below the x - ray band .",
    "this distance is determined by two competing transport mechanisms : advection ( bulk motion of plasma ) and diffusion ( random motion of electrons on the scale of gyroradii ) .",
    "considered separately , one can obtain simple expressions for the appropriate length scale for each in terms of the diffusion coefficient , @xmath5 , the downstream plasma speed in the shock frame , @xmath33 , and the synchrotron cooling time , @xmath34 .",
    "we can estimate @xmath35 , where @xmath36 in cgs , from the relation @xmath37 .",
    "thus , for @xmath38 , given by the rankine - hugoniot conditions for a strong adiabatic shock , we have an advective length of @xmath39 . for a diffusion coefficient that is taken as a constant multiple , @xmath40 , of the bohm value @xmath41 , where @xmath42 , we arrive at a diffusive length of @xmath43 . for the values of the constants @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47",
    "used here and throughout , see table  [ tab : const ] .",
    "now , an electron of energy @xmath12 in a magnetic field radiates primarily at the frequency @xmath48 so that the advection and diffusion lengths as a function of frequency are @xmath49 and @xmath50 the approximation that the electron radiates all its energy at @xmath51 is called the delta - function approximation . *",
    "the important result here is that @xmath52 varies as @xmath53 while @xmath54 is independent of frequency . * thus above some critical energy , @xmath55 , and an associated photon frequency , @xmath56 , electrons will be able to diffuse further in a loss time than they could advect , and electron diffusion will become the dominant method of transport .",
    "@xmath57 is found simply by equating the expressions for @xmath52 and @xmath54 : @xmath58 ( we have taken @xmath59 km s@xmath31 , assuming no shock modification by cosmic rays . )",
    "near this photon energy , both advection and diffusion are important .",
    "this simple approach was taken by ballet ( 2006 ) , bamba et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and yamazaki et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to infer magnetic field strengths of 1487 @xmath24 g in sn 1006 .",
    "vink @xmath10 laming ( 2003 ) used a similar technique for cas a , and estimated @xmath26 to be @xmath60 100 @xmath24 g .",
    "parizot et al .",
    "( 2006 ) adopted a somewhat more sophisticated approach , combining both processes in the steady state form of the one - dimensional transport equation to solve for the post - shock electron distribution @xmath61 ( vlk et al .",
    "1981 ) : @xmath62 where the loss term @xmath63 assumes that an electron maintains constant energy as it travels away from the injection site until a catastrophic dump at time @xmath34 .",
    "here the shock is at @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the distance downstream .",
    "the solution to this equation is @xmath66 , with the scale length @xmath67 given by :    @xmath68    ( berezkho & vlk 2004 , parizot et al .",
    "more explicitly , in terms of electron energy @xmath12 the scale length is @xmath69 at a given observation frequency @xmath70 , @xmath12 will depend on the magnetic field @xmath26 , by @xmath71 , so @xmath72 in order to estimate the strength of the magnetic field , we invert this expression so that it is a function of observables : @xmath73    in this equation @xmath67 is the scale length of the electron distribution , whereas we observe the scale length of the emitted synchrotron intensity , including line - of - sight projection effects . in the @xmath32-function approximation of the synchrotron emissivity , @xmath74 ( @xmath75 for relativistic electrons ) , and the radial intensity for a spherical shock is @xmath76 here",
    "@xmath25 is the sky - plane radius ( @xmath77 the shock radius ) , and @xmath78 is the line - of - sight coordinate . the resulting profile will have a fwhm @xmath79 , @xmath80 a projection factor .",
    "ballet ( 2006 ) showed that in the case of a purely exponential ( in space ) electron distribution and for a spherical source , the result of this integral will give @xmath81 , that is , a filament with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath82 .",
    "thus in terms of the observed filament width , @xmath83 , we have @xmath84 using this result , the post - shock magnetic field strength in the ne rim of sn1006 was estimated to be around 91 - 110 @xmath24 g for @xmath85 , an amplification of roughly 30 - 37 for an ambient 3 @xmath24 g field ( parizot et al .",
    "while those authors did not make use of the fact , we note that the inferred value of @xmath26 depends on observing frequency .",
    "it should be noted that the projection factor @xmath81 is entirely dependent on the exponential form of the synchrotron emissivity given from the solution of ( 5 ) , which may not be valid , as well as on the assumption of exact sphericity .",
    "this is an important caveat , as the width of the rims scales as @xmath86 ( from equation ( 8) ) , so , since the width is inversely proportional to the projection factor , @xmath80 , the above estimates for the post - shock magnetic field strength are proportional to @xmath87 . in our later calculations , however , we do not assume a simple constant projection factor and perform the full numerical line - of - sight integration",

    "the magnetic - field strength for sn 1006 predicted using this method is in the range of 90 - 130 @xmath24 g , an amplification of roughly 3043 for an ambient field of 3 @xmath24 g ( berezhko et al .",

    "2010 , rettig @xmath10 pohl 2012 ) .",
    "note : @xmath91 directly behind the shock [ tab : rev ]      in almost all previous calculations , the energy dependence of the filament width was ignored and profiles were fit at a single photon energy .",
    "one exception to this is the work of araya et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in their analysis of the shapes of the rims of cas a. interestingly , while araya et al . found no significant energy dependence in the rim widths between the energy ranges 36 kev and 610 kev , they did report a small but non - negligible difference between widths at 0.32 and 36 kev .",
    "however , they did not use this result as a parameter constraint . here",
    "we show that this dependence has important physical consequences for parameter estimation .    in all the models we shall consider , the diffusion coefficient rises with energy .",
    "this means that electrons with lower energies will stay closer to their original fluid element while those with higher energies move about more freely .",
    "specifically , as can be seen from equation 6 , for @xmath92 , @xmath93 , while for @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "this behavior shows up in how the width , @xmath67 , varies with energy , which we can parameterize as @xmath96 for a photon energy of @xmath97 . written in this way",

    "it is also clear from equation ( 13 ) that @xmath101 will go from @xmath102 , or in other words that the scale length , @xmath67 , will go from @xmath103 , as @xmath70 goes from @xmath104 ( for @xmath105 , or in our later notation , @xmath106 ) .      in 2005 pohl , yan , & lazarian",
    "introduced a more sophisticated approach , which suggested that claims of strong field amplification might be premature .",
    "they proposed several processes that could lead to an exponentially decaying magnetic field , as well as account for the narrow filamentation . in this case",
    ", rim profiles would reflect the spatial distribution of the magnetic field . unfortunately , there are no simple predictions for the magnetic - field damping length ( or detailed spatial dependence ) .",
    "there are a variety of physically possible damping mechanisms , so the damping length is a free parameter in models of this type ( although its dependence on the immediate post - shock value of @xmath26 can be preserved ) .",
    "cassam - chena  et al.(2007 ) used this idea to fit intensity profiles of the filaments in tycho s snr , employing a hydrodynamics code that included cosmic - ray shock modification ( increased compression ratios due to energetically important particles becoming relativistic and/or escaping ) .",
    "they generated model profiles assuming a magnetic - field profile with exponential damping , similar to our expression in section 3.4 below . by incorporating radio observations",
    ", they concluded that the synchrotron loss - limited model provides a slightly better fit than the magnetically damped model , though neither completely reproduces the radio profiles .",
    "more recently , rettig and pohl ( 2012 ) followed up by probing the observational consequences of both a magnetically damped model and a constant field model by using differences in the spectral index between the emission at the rim peak ( i.e. the emission from the shock front to a fwhm distance away)and in the `` plateau '' ( i.e. the emission from regions beyond the fwhm ) .",
    "their magnetic - field estimates for both models still favor @xmath107 60 @xmath24 g for sn1006 .",
    "marcowith & casse ( 2010 ) performed detailed calculations to investigate the magnetic - damping model , studying the amplification process due to linear and nonlinear cosmic - ray streaming instabilities , and identifying processes to damp the turbulent magnetic field .",
    "they report that a damping model could explain rims in the younger remnants cassiopeia a , tycho , and kepler , but not in sn 1006 or g347.30.5 ( rx j1713.7 - 3946 ) . for the objects which satisfy their conditions for magnetic",
    "damping , they deduce quite high magnetic - field strengths of 200  300 @xmath24 g .",
    "here , we will consider the case of diffusion coefficients of the form @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the bohm diffusion coefficient at an arbitrary fiducial energy @xmath110 and a magnetic field @xmath111 , @xmath40 is a constant scaling factor taken in conjunction with @xmath109 as a free parameter , and @xmath24 parameterizes the energy dependence of @xmath5 .",
    "( so for bohm diffusion , @xmath19 and @xmath112 ) for @xmath113 , @xmath110 must be above the relevant energy range for x - ray emitting electrons , so that @xmath5 remains greater than the minimum bohm value at all energies . on the other hand , for @xmath114 , this energy is the lower threshold energy for this exotic type of diffusion to occur .",
    "we expect @xmath24 to be related to the power - law index @xmath115 of hydromagnetic turbulence , @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the wave power per unit wavenumber",
    ". then @xmath118 corresponds to a kolmogorov spectrum , and @xmath119 to a kraichnan spectrum . in quasi - linear theory , particles have a mean free path inversely proportional to the energy density of mhd waves with wavelength comparable to the particle gyroradius , resulting in @xmath120 ( e.g. , reynolds 2004 ) .",
    "so kolmogorov turbulence predicts @xmath121 and kraichnan , @xmath122 .    in all of the ensuing discussion we will be concerning ourselves with the consequences of these models observable in the x - ray filaments of sn1006 , which we will characterize by their fwhm , @xmath123 , and its energy dependence , again parametrized by @xmath101",

    "it is presumably amplified from its initial value to the extent demanded by the data .",
    "furthermore , the cut - off energy , @xmath136 , is found by equating loss times and acceleration times , which gives , in the bohm limit ( rettig @xmath10 pohl 2012 ) : @xmath137 for arbitrary diffusion coefficients , it is a straightforward generalization to show : @xmath138 these analytic solutions were derived under the assumption that @xmath139 is a constant with respect to @xmath140 , the distance from the shock .",
    "this condition is somewhat peculiar in that it is only naturally satisfied if @xmath26 is constant , since the spatial dependence of @xmath141 is contained in its dependence on @xmath26 . for a field that evolves due to flux conservation",
    ", we expect this to be a reasonable approximation within a thin rim . on the other hand , for a rapidly varying magnetic field ( e.g. one that exponentially decays in space )",
    ", this imposes a rapid variation in @xmath141 with @xmath140 , which may or may not be realistic .",
    "however , we do not expect this to affect our results at the qualitative level , and some justification for this assumption can be found in rettig @xmath10 pohl ( 2012 ) .    using this spectrum of electrons , intensity profiles",
    "are then obtained by first evaluating the synchrotron emissivity @xmath142 with @xmath143 , and @xmath144 , in a slightly different notation from pacholczyk ( 1970 ) ; here @xmath145 is a bessel function of the second kind with imaginary argument .",

    "radial profiles at these energies reflect the spatial dependence of the magnetic field , and so , if this model is correct , we would expect thin filaments to be observed in high resolution radio images . at higher energies , the maximum value that @xmath100 reaches is determined by the competition between @xmath179 , @xmath54 , and @xmath52 .",

    "regardless of the underlying mechanism responsible for reducing the widths , that same mechanism explains this peak shift as it focuses the emission to increasingly narrow regions at higher energies .",
    "thus this effect is a model - independent prediction .",
    "however , determining the location of the peak emission from observations is a task much more uncertain than determining the fwhm of radial profiles .",
    "furthermore , the predicted shift in location can be quite small ( @xmath196 ) for the best - fit parameters found in section 4 .",
    "the combination of these two limitations leads us to ignore this effect in the rest of our analysis .",
    "we first considered using the delta function approximation of the emissivity , namely @xmath197 however , when compared with the full convolution of the particle distribution with the single electron emissivity , the results for the fwhms disagree considerably ( see figure  [ approxs ] ) .",
    "what is worse , the difference is dependent on the electron energy so that a simple constant correction factor could not be employed .",
    "the combination of the @xmath32-function approximation with the catastrophic dump form of the convection - diffusion equation seems to provide a much better approximation , but it does not account for the cut - off in the injected spectrum of electrons .",

    "this does not demonstrate that post - shock magnetic field damping can not occur , or that rims might not be magnetically damped at much lower observation energies , but it provides sufficient evidence that the damping length must at least be large enough to be unimportant , i.e. , larger than the synchrotron - loss length , for electrons radiating at kev energies .",
    "therefore , we confidently conclude that the x - ray rims of sn1006 are _ not _ well described by the magnetically damped model .",
    "in this section we will analyze the results of applying our model of section 3 to the sn1006 data presented in section 4 .    in fitting the data for various values of @xmath24",
    ", we were able to acquire the best fit diffusion coefficient energy relation in the region in which electron energies are relevant for kev emission .",
    "fitting the data allowed us to constrain both the magnitude and the energy - dependence of the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 , where the latter is reflected in the values of @xmath24 for which we could obtain fits .",
    "however , fixing the magnitude of @xmath5 at some energy only fixes the combination @xmath294 , so there is a degeneracy in the choice of @xmath40 and @xmath110 .",
    "there are two restricting conditions .",
    "the first is that @xmath302 at all energies , as the bohm coefficient is the minimum allowable . in other words ,",
    "@xmath303 for @xmath132 , this restricts @xmath304 diffusion to above some threshold energy @xmath110 , while for @xmath113 , this restricts @xmath304 diffusion to below some maximum energy @xmath126 .",
    "it also means that the constant @xmath40 must always be greater than 1 as @xmath305 = @xmath40 .",
    "the second restriction is that @xmath110 should be outside the relevant energy range for electrons emitting kev x - rays , as all of our calculations had a fixed value for @xmath24 . what we can find , however , is the minimum ( for @xmath113 ) or maximum ( for @xmath132 ) value of this energy bound by fixing @xmath40 at 1 . for our successful fits that have non - negligible diffusion coefficients , the results of doing this give values of @xmath126 that are so far outside the 0.77 kev photon range that we can easily find an appropriate @xmath126 to satisfy the above conditions .",
    "from tables  [ tab : anal ] and  [ tab : num ] , we see that several of our averaged filaments require very small diffusion coefficients , well below the bohm value , even using the amplified magnetic field .",
    "this obviously implies that varying the parameter @xmath24 will have no effect on the fits , as is evident in the fitted values for @xmath111 .",
    "qualitatively , this means that the transport of electrons is being carried out dominantly by the convection of plasma away from the shock , and that each electron will stay attached to its particular fluid element .",
    "this result is required by the strong energy dependence ( @xmath306 ) of the filament widths , as the presence of diffusion will always drive @xmath101 towards 0 ( or beyond to positive numbers in the case of @xmath132 . on the other hand ,",
    "filaments with non - negligible diffusion coefficients are all consistent with the condition that @xmath307 , within their respective uncertainties .",
    "this may suggest that some mechanism is severely limiting electron diffusion in various regions of the remnant , primarily the sw .",
    "one shortcoming of the magnetically damped model is the requirement that @xmath308 is constant .",
    "this implies that the diffusion coefficient varies as @xmath309 , when we have explicitly written the diffusion coefficient as proportional to @xmath310 in our formalism .",
    "however , this does not affect our conclusion that the magnetically limited model is a poor fit to the data , as the qualitative behavior of the fwhms as a function of energy would be the same .",
    "this requirement presents no issues in the case of the loss - limited model , as both @xmath5 and @xmath26 are spatially uniform in the narrow region behind the shock .",
    "our finding that rim widths drop too rapidly with energy to allow significant diffusion suggests the possibility of `` sub - bohm diffusion '' ( @xmath311 , or @xmath312 ) in astrophysical sources .",
    "this possibility has important implications for acceleration times , since much smaller diffusion coefficients @xmath5 would result in much shorter acceleration times to a given energy .",
    "there has been considerable discussion of the possibility of sub - bohm diffusion in the literature .",
    "for instance , zank et al .  ( 2006 ) find that in perpendicular shocks in the solar wind , effective mean free paths can be an order of magnitude or more less than the gyroradius .",
    "they find some supporting evidence in heliospheric observations . using a 3d hybrid mhd - kinetic code , reville & bell ( 2013 ) studied the development of shock precursors generated by accelerated particles , finding sub - bohm behavior for both parallel and oblique shocks , but more pronounced for parallel shocks .",
    "however , some of their simulations find that the bohm limit is still respected using the amplified magnetic field .",
    "reville & bell discuss other possible ambiguities in the definition of the bohm limit , including the possibility of highly inhomogeneous magnetic fields on small scales . at any rate",
    ", it seems clear that the complexities of the propagation of particles in the presence of dynamic self - generated magnetic turbulence are such that the suppression of diffusion to levels considerably below those implied by the bohm limit is not ruled out by theoretical considerations .",
    "we emphasize that in spite of the elaborate theoretical structure we have presented , our limits on the diffusion coefficient are closely related to the rapid drop in filament widths with photon energy that we see in figure [ widthdata ] .",
    "the rate of shrinkage is too large to tolerate much particle diffusion , independently of detailed modeling .",
    "however , detailed quantitative statements are dependent on the details of our mechanism for fitting filament widths , and on inevitable projection and curvature effects .",
    "our models do predict considerably thinner filaments at 4 kev than at 2 ; while our current observations do not have adequate photon statistics to test this prediction , future studies should be performed to clarify this important issue .    finally , we call attention to the @xmath24 dependence in the electron cut - off energy used in our model as described in equation ( 19 ) . for a synchrotron emitting source",
    ", this cut - off energy corresponds to a rolloff frequency of @xmath313 .",
    "if @xmath125 as in the standard bohm assumption , we find a rolloff frequency that is independent of the magnetic field and solely a function of the shock speed . in that case , we would expect constant rolloff frequencies along the same filaments and only a relatively weak azimuthal dependence , predictable from observed proper motions . on the other hand , if @xmath165 , then we recover a @xmath111 dependence , which could account for the some of the systematic order - of - magnitude azimuthal variation of the measured rolloff frequencies seen in both sn1006 ( katsuda et al .",
    "2010 , miceli et al .",
    "2009 , reynolds et al .",
    "2012 ) and g1.9 + 0.3 ( reynolds et al .",
    "2009 ) . for @xmath314 ,",
    "one would require a very large variation in @xmath111 , largest at the brightness maxima , to explain the observed factor of 10 range in rolloff frequency , however .      a detailed application of our results to other snrs such as cas a will require much more extensive analysis , but we can use the published filament widths of araya et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for cas a to get preliminary estimates of the magnetic field strength and diffusion coefficient by applying our model . in their data",
    ", it appears that the filaments in cas a shrink by a factor of @xmath315 between 0.3 and 3 kev , while the filament widths appear to be energy - independent between 3 and 6 kev .",
    "qualitatively , this is consistent with the loss - limited model , as our parameter @xmath101 is predicted to decrease with energy .",
    "for the lower energy range of 0.33 kev , reproducing @xmath316 ( equivalent to the factor of 0.8 drop in size ) requires magnetic fields on the order of 200 - 500 @xmath24 g and diffusion coefficients about @xmath317(3 kev ) , about an order of magnitude higher than the values one obtains by neglecting the energy dependence .",
    "one can also see directly from figure  [ etagraph ] that @xmath318 models of the diffusion coefficient are excluded for @xmath316 .",
    "we have outlined a generalized diffusion model that solves the continuous energy - loss convection - diffusion equation for electrons subject to both convection and diffusion as they travel away from the shock .",
    "this model is able to incorporate arbitrary power - law energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient @xmath5 , in the form of @xmath319 , as well as arbitrary spatial dependence of the magnetic field strength .",
    "assuming spherical symmetry , we then convolved this electron distribution with the single electron power spectrum to obtain a non - thermal emissivity , which we integrated along lines of sight to obtain the specific intensity of the source as a function of radial distance from its center .",
    "we specialized this model into two general categories : a `` magnetically damped model , '' which assumes @xmath320 for @xmath140 defined as the distance behind the shock , and a `` loss - limited model '' which assumes a constant post - shock magnetic field strength .",
    "furthermore , we selected specific values of the parameter @xmath24 ( namely 0,1/3 , 1/2 , 1 , 1.5 , and 2 ) to analyze .",
    "we found that independent of model details , magnetically damped models predict rim widths almost independent of photon energy , while loss - limited models predict rim widths to shrink with increasing photon energy at a rate dependent on the diffusion coefficient .",
    "our quantitative results are summarized in figure  [ etagraph ] .    with this model as our guide , we used _",
    "observations of sn 1006 to measure the energy dependence of the thin , non - thermal rims in the ne and sw quadrants . for the sw , these are the first such measurements , utilizing data from a recent large _ chandra _ project .",
    "the sw filament profiles are of similar width to those in the ne .",
    "this is consistent with the results of winkler et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , who find the conditions in both regions to be similar .",
    "furthermore , the filament widths of sn1006 show a decrease with photon energy , which we have shown has important physical consequences for both the diffusion coefficient and the post - shock magnetic field , and is incompatible with a magnetic damping model . in the other snrs for which magnetic fields have been inferred from rim thicknesses , the energy dependence of the widths should be examined similarly , as evidenced by our quick comparison with the results of araya et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for cas a.    using our generalized diffusion model and its subsets outlined above , we find the measured widths of the sw filaments of sn 1006 , like those previously reported for the ne , favor magnetic fields on the order of 100 @xmath24 g , significantly amplified above the typical interstellar medium value of about 3 @xmath321 .",
    "the strength of our model is that it encompasses all effects included by previous authors in this type of investigation .",
    "we also conclude that for the filaments of sn 1006 , and even the filaments of cas a , values of @xmath113 are , for the most part , less able to reproduce the data .",
    "this is due to the result that the lowest possible @xmath101 for a given diffusion coefficient is @xmath322 , which requires @xmath323 in filaments 2 and 5 for sn 1006 and the majority of filaments in cas a ( araya et al . 2010 ) .",
    "while not conclusive , this result is in agreement with the calculations of reynolds ( 2004 ) , which predict snr images that do not resemble observed snrs for @xmath113 .",
    "thus both kolmogorov turbulence ( @xmath121 ) and kraichnan ( @xmath122 ) are disfavored . in an application to other snrs ,",
    "values of @xmath132 allow completely energy - independent filament widths even with a cut - off in the injected spectrum of electrons .",
    "thus , the results of araya et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who found energy independent fwhms in cas a between 3 - 6 kev , could result from strong diffusion and a very high electron cut - off energy , or from non - bohm - like diffusion with @xmath132 . in the latter case",
    ", our model also predicts that the rolloff frequency should depend on magnetic field strength and thus could have significant azimuthal dependence .",
    "we also find that that the magnitudes of the diffusion coefficients in the filaments of sn1006 are split into two distinct categories .",
    "one group , due to the strong energy dependence of their filament widths , requires negligible amounts of diffusion ( i.e. less than the bohm limit ) in order to reproduce the observations .",
    "the occurrence of sub - bohm diffusion is thus far undocumented and would be a groundbreaking result .",
    "however , there are inherent uncertainties in our measurements of the fwhms due to projection , overlap , and averaging effects which may have influenced our numerical calculations .",
    "thus , we do not claim strong evidence of this theoretically hard to explain phenomenon and note that further study is needed . on the other hand ,",
    "we are much more confident in the rest of our conclusions , which are fairly robust and do not depend on sub - bohm diffusion .",
    "the second group , with less energy - dependent filament widths , is consistent with diffusion coefficients close to but above the bohm limit .",
    "this result is of interest because the strength of diffusion is directly tied to the maximum energy attainable by electrons being accelerated at the shock front .",
    "diffusion coefficients much larger than the bohm value would have suggested weaker scattering , which in turn would reduce the maximum energy ( reynolds 1998 ) .",
    "however , in our model of the filaments , the radial profiles are produced by electrons in the post - shock region , so pre - shock electrons could have much different diffusive properties .",
    "our fits predict continuing shrinkage of filament widths at higher energies than 2 kev , though photon statistics in our current observations are not adequate to test this .",
    "( our 27 kev band is dominated by photons near 2 kev . ) a longer observation of the sw region of sn 1006 with _",
    "chandra _ could allow division of that band into 2  4 and 4  7 kev bands , permitting this important test .",
    "our surprising result of rapid shrinkage of some filaments requiring sub - bohm diffusion coefficients can be searched for in other thin - rim remnants such as tycho .    finally , we find that the results of applying our generalized diffusion model are remarkably consistent with the results obtained by simply fitting equation 6 to the data ( recall that equation 6 was the result of applying the @xmath32-function approximation for the electron spectra to the catastrophic dump version of the convection - diffusion equation ) .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that our model solves the continuous energy loss convection - diffusion equation for the electron distribution , uses the full synchrotron emissivity , and includes a cutoff in the injected spectrum of electrons , all of which we have shown to have important effects on the fwhms and their energy dependence .",
    "this may simply be a unique result for the observational data from sn1006 , or it could suggest that the the effects of adding each of these more detailed considerations cancel each other out when combined . on the other hand , equation 6",
    "is incapable of describing magnetically damped filaments , which may occur in other remnants ( e.g. , marcowith & casse 2010 ) , though we have ruled this out for sn1006 .",
    "the general formalism presented here is applicable to the thin , non - thermal filaments observed in nearly all historical snrs , and has the potential to provide a consistent estimate of magnetic - field amplification across the variety of ambient environments into which these remnants are expanding .",
    "support for this work was provided by the national aeronautics and space administration through _ chandra _ grant number go2 - 13066 , issued by the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory center , which is operated by the smithsonian astrophysical observatory for and on behalf of nasa under contract nas8 - 03060 .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for an extremely careful reading of this paper , and for suggestions that have led to substantial improvements .",
    "we summarize here some details of the relation of our models to observations .",
    "our basic conclusion is that the variation of filament widths with energy contains essential information required to compare models , and to obtain quantitative estimates of the magnetic field and diffusion coefficient . without this information ,",
    "there are several competing models that can allow for a wide range of magnetic - field strengths and diffusion coefficients for the same filament width .",
    "we assume throughout a spherical shock surface , in which the peak of synchrotron emission occurs at a radius slightly behind the shock due to the geometry of the line of sight integration .",
    "if instead a plane shock with velocity exactly in the plane of the sky is assumed , derived quantities will vary somewhat .",
    "in addition , we find that the @xmath32-function approximation gives a poor representation of the spatial distribution of high - energy electrons , resulting in an underestimate of filament widths .",
    "it is also essential to consider the cutoff in the electron spectrum above some maximum energy as it causes filament widths to shrink with photon energy in a model - independent way . at photon energies close to the rolloff frequency ,",
    "the only way to have truly energy - independent rim sizes is with @xmath324 in energy - loss models with @xmath325 , or damping models , @xmath326 will always be at least @xmath60 0.1 if the cutoff is not exceptionally high ( well above the kev band ) .",
    "then the strength of the energy - dependence of filament widths serves as the essential discriminant among models .",
    "if a weak energy dependence ( @xmath327 ) is observed for photon energies near the synchrotron rolloff frequency , the behavior at lower photon energies should be inspected as it will have greater discriminatory power . here",
    "`` lower energies '' means energies lower than those where diffusion and the electron cutoff start to become important , which depend on the source parameters . near the rolloff frequency",
    ", many effects can combine to cause weak energy - dependence of filament widths .",
    "if moderately strong energy - dependence of filament widths is observed ( @xmath328 ) at a specific energy , then a magnetic - field damping model can be ruled out at that energy and above .",
    "this is the region in which it can be assumed that diffusion is important in competing with advection .",
    "the details of this then depend on the assumed model of diffusion . and if very strong energy - dependence of filament widths is observed ( @xmath329 )",
    "then the only explanation is weak diffusion and the predominance of advection as the electron transport mechanism .",
    "finally , if filaments widths are ever observed to be growing with energy then the only known explanation would be @xmath132 diffusion .",
    "higher values of @xmath24 allow for more rapid changes in @xmath100 as a function of energy .",
