    "debris disks are the exosolar analogs of our zodiacal light and kuiper belt and each new discovery represents an opportunity to understand how planetary systems form and evolve around other stars .",
    "schneider , silverstone & hines ( 2005 ) recently showed that hd 32297 , an a star at @xmath0112@xmath2 pc , illuminates a dusty nebulosity resembling the edge - on debris disks around @xmath3 pic @xcite and au mic @xcite .",
    "hd 32297 was one of 26 stars that they identified as debris disk candidates for coronagraphic imaging with the nicmos camera aboard the _ hubble space telescope_. using the f110w filter ( @xmath4= 1104 nm , @xmath5 = 592 nm ) , the hd 32297 disk was found to be extended by at least 400 au ( 3.3@xmath6 ) to the northeast with pa = 47.6@xmath7 ( g. schneider , 2005 , private communication ) , and at least 250 au to the southwest .",
    "the hundreds of au extent of the disk , and the significant asymmetry , are indeed comparable to those of @xmath3 pic @xcite . here",
    "we present new @xmath8-band observations of hd 32297 using a ground - based coronagraphic camera that reveal a larger and more asymmetric circumstellar nebulosity than shown by the hst data .",
    "we artificially eclipsed hd 32297 using an optical stellar coronagraph at the university of hawaii 2.2-m telescope on mauna kea , hawaii @xcite .",
    "data were acquired with a tek 2048@xmath92048 ccd with a scale of 0.407@xmath6/pixel and through a standard broadband @xmath8 filter ( @xmath4=647 nm , @xmath5 = 125 nm ) .",
    "observations were made on 28 september , 2005 , with a 6.5@xmath6 diameter occulting spot and 1320 seconds effective integration time .",
    "measurements of photometric standard stars showed photometric condition , with image quality , as measured by the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of field stars , equal to @xmath01.2@xmath6 .",
    "a series of short , unocculted integrations yielded @xmath10 mag for hd 32297 .",
    "we also observed three other bright stars with the coronagraph to check for spurious features such as diffraction spikes and internal reflections .",
    "after the data were bias subtracted , flat - fielded and sky - subtracted , we subtracted the stellar point spread function ( psf ) to remove excess stellar light from around the occulting spot .",
    "we used the real psf s from other stars observed throughout each night , as well as artificial psf s .",
    "artificial psf subtraction is effective for hd 32297 because the circumstellar disk is close to edge - on .",
    "we extracted the stellar psf for each image of hd 32297 by sampling the image radially in a direction perpendicular to the pa of the disk .",
    "we then fit a polynomial to the data and generated an artificial psf that is a figure of rotation of the polynomial .",
    "the psf s were then scaled and registered to each data frame such that subtraction minimized the residual light in directions perpendicular to the disk beyond the edge of the occulting spot .",
    "figure 1 presents our @xmath8-band image of nebulosity surrounding hd 32297 .",
    "the inner detection limit is 5.0@xmath6 and the nebulosity is detected as far as 15@xmath6 ( 1680 au ) radius . on these spatial scales",
    "the two ansae taken together do not resemble a circumstellar disk because the apparent midplanes diverge in position angle .",
    "instead the curved morphology resembles that of pre - main sequence stars such as su aur and z cma @xcite . the northeast side is a relatively narrow structure resembling the near edge - on disk described by @xcite , but with pa = 34@xmath111@xmath1 that is 13.6@xmath1 smaller than that measured in the hst nicmos data .",
    "the southwest side of the nebulosity is a broader structure that curves westward with radius .",
    "we adopt pa = @xmath12 , which is 18@xmath1 away from the midplane pa measured by @xcite , and forms a 31@xmath1 angle with the northeast midplane in our data .",
    "the fwhm of the disk perpendicular to the midplane at @xmath13 radius is @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the ne and sw sides , respectively .",
    "the midplane radial surface brightness profiles for the sw side is @xmath16 mag arcsec@xmath17 brighter than the ne side between 5@xmath18 radius , and approximately equal further out ( fig .",
    "2 ) . psf subtraction dominates the uncertainty in the absolute flux measurements , but the relative flux measurements between the ne and sw sides remain constant between different psf subtractions . the cumulative magnitudes for the ne and sw extensions are equal to within a tenth of a magnitude , with @xmath8=@xmath19 mag for each side . again",
    "the uncertainty depends on the psf subtraction and scales upward or downward uniformly for both sides of the disk .",
    "to first order , both extensions have the same scattering cross - section of dust , even though the spatial distribution is significantly different , similar to the findings for the @xmath3 pic disk @xcite .",
    "between 5@xmath20 radius the two midplane profiles can be described by power - laws with indices @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the ne and sw sides , respectively ( fig .",
    "these indices are comparable to the @xmath23 surface brightness profile of the ne midplane between 1.6@xmath6 and 3.3@xmath6 radius @xcite .",
    "the similarity supports extrapolating the @xmath8-band surface brightness profile inward to estimate the @xmath24 disk color within 3.3@xmath6 radius ( fig .",
    "we find @xmath25 mag for the ne extension and @xmath26 mag for the sw extension , whereas the intrinsic stellar color is @xmath24 = + 0.21 mag .",
    "the blue scattered light color is consistent with sub - micron raleigh scattering grains found in the interstellar medium @xcite , as well as the outer region of the au mic debris disk @xcite .",
    "if hd 32297 is comparable in spectral type to @xmath3 pic ( a5v ) , then grains with radii smaller than @xmath05 @xmath27 m will be blown out of the system on one dynamical timescale ( @xmath010@xmath28 yr ; artymowicz & clampin 1997 ) .",
    "below we discuss how the presence of small grains ( @xmath00.1 @xmath27 m ) leads to several plausible scenarios for the origin of the nebulosity and the age of the system .",
    "the asymmetric , large - scale morphology and the blue color of nebulosity surrounding hd 32297 indicate that a population of dust grains may be primordial originating from the interstellar medium .",
    "interstellar grains have a size distribution that peaks at @xmath29 @xmath27 m @xcite and many reflection nebulosities have a blue color @xcite .",
    "however , the morphology of the hd 32297 nebulosity between 0.5@xmath6 and 1.7@xmath6 radius satisfies four criteria for the imaging detection of a circumstellar disk @xcite . in this inner region",
    "the disk is relatively symmetric and a power - law fit to the surface brightness profile has index -3.6 @xcite , which is comparable to the outer disk regions of @xmath3 pic and au mic @xcite .",
    "the steepness of this surface brightness profile is consistent with models of an outward propagation of grains from an interior source region due to radiation pressure @xcite . beyond 1.7@xmath6 ( 190 au ) radius",
    "the disk may overlap with an interstellar nebulosity or it is influenced by forces that are otherwise insignificant in the inner disk .",
    "if the large - scale nebulosity is produced by a random encounter between an a star and a clump of interstellar gas and dust , then the resulting morphology should demonstrate the signature linear filamentary features of the pleiades phenomenon @xcite .",
    "we do not detect pleiades - like nebulosity , though interaction with the ism is nevertheless plausible as the galactic location of hd 32297 ( @xmath30=192.83@xmath1 , @xmath31=-20.17@xmath1 ) coincides with a ridge of relatively high density gas outside of our local bubble ( fig 3 ; kalas et al .",
    "this ridge also contains two stars surrounded by optical nebulosity that are members of the pleiades open cluster ( m45 ; d = @xmath32 pc ; van leeuwen 1999 ) . the proper motion vector of hd 32297 ( @xmath33 mas / yr , @xmath34 mas / yr ) points to the south - southeast , with a sky - plane motion corresponding to 13.4 km",
    "s@xmath35 at 112 pc distance . therefore the southern side of the disk will suffer enhanced erosion that would result in both a brighter nebulosity and diminished disk mass , compared to the northern side of the disk .",
    "@xcite refer to this process as ism sandblasting , and @xcite show that stellar radiation pressure would protect the circumstellar disk from the ism up to a few hundred au radius from the star .",
    "the ism avoidance radius is a function of several factors , such as ism density , relative velocity , and encounter geometry .",
    "a more detailed model applied specifically to hd 32297 is required to understand if the observed disk asymmetries are consistent with ism sandblasting .",
    "however , @xcite cautioned that ism grains do not have sufficient mass to perturb grains vertically away from a disk midplane .",
    "if this is valid , then other processes could create the observed @xmath8-band asymmetries , such as the entrainment of small grains by the ism gas that should be associated with the ism dust , or dynamical perturbations from the two stars , hd 32304 ( g5 , @xmath36 pc ) and bd + 7 777s , south - southeast of hd 32297 ( figs . 1 & 4 ) .    in the ism sandblasting scenario , hd 32297",
    "could be a main sequence star presently undergoing a random encounter with a clump of ism .",
    "an alternate hypothesis is that hd 32297 is very young , and the nebulosity resembles that of su aur and z cma because the dust is the remnant of an outflow cavity , or more generally represents pristine matter from the natal cloud .",
    "the position angle discrepancies could arise because hst nicmos is sensitive to the circumstellar disk at @xmath37200 au radius with pa @xmath38 , whereas our @xmath8 band data observe the top ( out of the sky - plane ) of an outflow cavity associated with this inner disk .",
    "however , the lack of reddening ( @xmath39 = 0.54 mag , @xmath40 = 0.06 , @xmath41 = 0.03 ) generally argues against a massive obscuring dust disk , such as that discovered around the herbig ae / be star pds 144n @xcite .",
    "examination of several degrees of sky surrounding hd 32297 in the digitized sky survey reveals filamentary nebulosities to the southeast and southwest , apparently associated with the @xmath42 orionis molecular ring ( sh 2 - 264 ) to the east ( fig .",
    "@xmath42 orionis is in the background at @xmath0400 pc , and its diameter is no greater than 20 pc in radius @xcite .",
    "therefore , hd 32297 must originate from a different star forming region .",
    "taurus - aurigae , @xmath010@xmath1 to the north of hd 32297 and with heliocentric distance @xmath43 pc @xcite , may be a possibility .",
    "the proper motion of hd 32297 is comparable to t tauri stars in this region @xcite , but it does not have a relative excess southward that would flag hd 32297 as a runaway star . therefore ,",
    "if hd 32297 is indeed a pre - main sequence star , then it formed in relative isolation from taurus - aurigae within an outlying clump of the main molecular cloud .",
    "the discovery of young stars south of taurus led @xcite through a similar considerations when discussing the origin of their lithium - rich targets .",
    "in addition , they proposed two alternatives that may be applicable to hd 32297 .",
    "first , they noted that the midplane of the gould belt , with age @xmath030 myr , passes south of taurus .",
    "in fact , hd 32297 is located within the gould belt midplane .",
    "second , star formation in taurus - aurigae may have been triggered 30 myr ago when a high - velocity cloud passed northward through the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "the first generation of stars formed at this earlier epoch within the molecular cloud , which eventually passed again southward through the galactic plane .",
    "the second passage formed a new generation of stars observed today in taurus - aurigae , with the first generation separating from the natal material when the latter decelerated as it encountered denser ism in the galactic plane .",
    "the first - generation stars are currently found south of taurus ( both in galactic latitude and declination ) . therefore , whether associated with the gould belt or with taurus - aurigae , the young stars presently located south of the taurus molecular cloud have age @xmath030 myr .",
    "hd 32297 may be a member of either group given that the relatively large dust disk surrounding it may be adopted as a proxy for spectroscopic youth indicators .",
    "coronagraphic @xmath8-band data reveal that the circumstellar nebulosity surrounding hd 32297 is significantly distorted relative to the near edge - on disk observed within 400 au with hst nicmos .",
    "we detect nebulosity as far as 1680 au radius , with long axes that deviate from the nicmos position angles by @xmath015@xmath1 for each midplane .",
    "the southwest midplane is warped and vertically distended .",
    "we invoke the possibility of ism sandblasting , which is consistent with the southward proper motion of hd 32297 .",
    "we examine several scenarios relating to the age and origin of hd 32297 .",
    "association with either the gould belt or taurus - aurigae would give age @xmath030 myr , similar to that of @xmath3 pic .",
    "a younger age is also possible if hd 32297 formed in an isolated , outlying cloud of taurus - aurigae .",
    "if the ism sandblasting scenario is correct , then future multi - color imaging should reveal significant color differences between the northeast and southwest sides of the disk .",
    "the southwest side may also show significant color structure perpendicular to disk midplane if the apparent distortions in the disk are due to small grains swept northward .",
    "are possible if either hd 32304 or bd + 7 777s to the southeast are physically associated with hd 32297 . future spectroscopic observations of hd 32297 should also include these two stars to constrain their spectral types , relative motions , and ages .",
    "if the radial velocities support a physical association , then either hd 32304 or bd + 7 777s may demonstrate additional age indicators that would constrain the evolutionary status of hd 32297 . moreover , if hd 32297 is a @xmath3 pic analog , then multi - epoch spectroscopy should test for the variable , transient redshifted features thought to arise from cometary activity under the dynamical influence of planets @xcite .",
    "this work was supported in part by nasa grants to p.k , and by the nsf center for adaptive optics , managed by the university of california , santa cruz , under cooperative agreement ast 98 - 76783 .",
    "we thank michael ratner ( sao / harvard ) for supporting the observing campaigns at the university of hawaii 2.2-m telescope ."
