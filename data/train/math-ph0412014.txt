    "the present paper is concerned with the study of charged superselection sectors in globally hyperbolic spacetimes in the framework of the algebraic approach to quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the basic object of this approach is the abstract net _ of local observables _",
    "@xmath2 , namely the correspondence @xmath3 which associates to any element @xmath4 of a family @xmath5 of relatively compact open regions of the spacetime @xmath6 , considered as a fixed background manifold , the @xmath1algebra @xmath7 generated by all the observables which are measurable within @xmath4 .",
    "sectors are unitary equivalence classes of irreducible representations of this net , the labels distinguishing different classes are the quantum numbers .",
    "the study of physically meaningful sectors of the net of local observables , and how to select them , is the realm of the theory of superselection sectors .",
    "+ one of the main results of superselection sectors theory has been the demonstration that in minkowski space @xmath8 , among the representations of the net of local observables it is possible to select a family of sectors whose quantum numbers manifest the same properties as the charges carried by elementary particles : a _ composition law _ , the _ alternative of bose and fermi statistics _ and the _ charge conjugation symmetry_. the first example of sectors manifesting these properties has been provided in @xcite , known as dhr - analysis , where the authors investigated sharply localized sectors .",
    "namely , a representation @xmath9 of @xmath2 is a sector of dhr - type whenever its restriction to the spacelike complement @xmath10 of any element @xmath4 of @xmath5 is unitary equivalent to the vacuum representation @xmath11 of the net , in symbols @xmath12 although no known charge present in nature is sharply localized , the importance of the dhr - analysis resides in the following reasons .",
    "first , it suggests the idea that physically charged sectors might be localized in a more generalized sense with respect to ( [ int:1 ] ) .",
    "secondly , the introduction of powerful techniques based only on the causal structure of the minkowski space that can be used to investigate other types of localized sectors .",
    "a relevant example are the bf - sectors @xcite which describe charges in purely massive theories .",
    "bf - sectors are localized in spacelike cones , which are a family of noncompact regions of @xmath8 . in curved spacetimes",
    "the nontrivial topology can induce superselection sectors , see @xcite and references quoted therein . however , up until now , the localization properties of these sectors are not known , hence it is still not possible to investigate their charge structure .",
    "+ in the present paper we deal with the study of sectors of dhr - type in arbitrary globally hyperbolic spacetimes .",
    "because of the sharp localization , sectors of dhr - type should be insensitive to the nontrivial topology of the spacetime , and their quantum numbers should exhibit the same features as in minkowski space .",
    "however , the first investigations @xcite have provided only partial results in this direction , and , in particular , they have pointed out that for particular classes of spacetimes the topology might affect the properties of sectors of dhr - type . the aim of the present paper is to show how this type of sectors and the topology of spacetime are related and that they manifest the properties described above also in an arbitrary globally hyperbolic spacetime .",
    "we want to stress that the results of this paper are confined to spacetimes whose dimension is @xmath0 . + before entering the theory of dhr - sectors in globally hyperbolic spacetimes",
    ", a key fact has still to be mentioned .",
    "the dhr - analysis can be equivalently read in terms of _ net - cohomology of posets _ , a cohomological approach initiated and developed by j.e .",
    "roberts @xcite , ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "such an approach makes clear that the spacetime information which is relevant for the analysis of the dhr - sectors is the topological and the causal structure of minkowski space ( the poincar symmetry enters the theory only in the definition of the vacuum representation ) .",
    "in particular , the essential point is how these two properties are encoded in the structure of the index @xmath5 as a partially ordered set ( _ poset _ ) with respect to _ inclusion _ order relation @xmath13 .",
    "representations satisfying ( [ int:1 ] ) are , up to equivalence , in 1 - 1 correspondence with 1-cocycles @xmath14 of the poset @xmath5 with values in the vacuum representation of the net @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the von neumann algebra obtained by taking the bicommutant @xmath17 of @xmath18 .",
    "these 1-cocycles , which are nothing but the charge transporters of dhr - analysis , define a tensor @xmath1category @xmath19 with a permutation symmetry and conjugation .",
    "+ the first investigation of sectors of dhr - type in a globally hyperbolic spacetime @xmath6 has been done in @xcite .",
    "first , the authors consider the net of local observables @xmath20 indexed by the set @xmath21 of regular diamonds of @xmath6 : a family of relatively compact open sets codifying the topological and the causal properties of @xmath6 .",
    "secondly , they take a reference representation @xmath11 of @xmath20 on a hilbert space @xmath22 such that the net @xmath23 satisfies haag duality and the borchers property ( see section [ c ] ) .",
    "the reference representation @xmath11 plays for the theory the same role that the vacuum representation plays in the case of minkowski space .",
    "examples of physically meaningful nets of local algebras indexed by regular diamonds have been given in @xcite . finally , the dhr - sectors are singled out from the representations of the net @xmath20 by generalizing , in a suitable way , the criterion ( [ int:1 ] ) . as in minkowski space ,",
    "the physical content of dhr - sectors is contained in the @xmath1category @xmath24 of 1-cocycles of @xmath21 with values in @xmath25 , and when @xmath21 is directed under inclusion , there exist a tensor product , a symmetry and conjugated 1-cocycles .",
    "the analogy with the theory in the minkowski space breaks down when the @xmath21 is not directed .",
    "in this situation only the introduction of a tensor product on @xmath24 and the existence of a symmetry have been achieved in @xcite , although the definition of the tensor product is not completely discussed ( see below ) .",
    "+ there are two well known topological conditions on the spacetime , implying that not only regular diamonds but any reasonable set of indices for a net of local algebras is not directed : this happens when the spacetime is either nonsimply connected or has compact cauchy surfaces ( corollary [ ada:7 ] and lemma [ ba:2 ] ) .",
    "there arises , therefore , the necessity to understand the connection between net - cohomology and topology of the underlying spacetime .",
    "progress in this direction has been achieved in @xcite .",
    "the homotopy of paths , the net - cohomology under a change of the index set are issues developed in that work that will turn out to be fundamental for our aim . moreover",
    ", it has been shown that the statistics of sectors can be classified provided that the net satisfies punctured haag duality ( see section [ c ] ) .",
    "however , no result concerning the conjugation has been achieved . + to see what is the main drawback caused by the non directness of the poset @xmath21 , we have to describe more in detail @xmath24 .",
    "the elements @xmath14 of @xmath24 are 1-cocycles trivial in @xmath26 or , equivalently , path - independent on @xmath21 .",
    "the latter means that the evaluation of @xmath14 on a path of @xmath21 depends only on the endpoints of the path .",
    "when @xmath21 is directed any 1-cocycle is trivial in @xmath26 , but this might not be hold when @xmath21 is not directed . the consequences can be easily showed : let @xmath27 be the tensor product introduced in @xcite : for any @xmath28 , it turns out that @xmath29 is a 1-cocycle of @xmath21 with values in @xmath25 , but it is not clear whether it is trivial in @xmath26 ( we will see in remark [ cc:5a ] that this 1-cocycle is trivial in @xmath26 ) .",
    "now , we know that the nonsimply connectedness and the compactness of the cauchy surfaces are topological obstructions to the directness of the index sets . the first aim of this paper is to understand whether these conditions are also obstructions to the triviality in @xmath26 of 1-cocycles .",
    "this problem is analyzed in great generality in section [ a ] .",
    "we introduce the notions of the first homotopy group and fundamental group for an abstract poset @xmath30 ( definition [ ab:12 ] ) and prove that any 1-cocycle @xmath14 of @xmath30 , with values in a net of local algebras @xmath31 indexed by @xmath30 , defines a unitary representation of the fundamental group of @xmath30 ( theorem [ ac:4 ] ) . in the case that @xmath30 is a basis for a topological space ordered under inclusion , and whose elements are arcwise and simply connected sets , then the fundamental group of @xmath30 is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the underlying topological space ( theorem [ ada:6 ] ) .",
    "this states that _ the only possible topological obstruction to the triviality in @xmath26 of 1-cocycles is the nonsimply connectedness _ ( corollary [ adb:2 ] ) .",
    "+ before studying superselection sectors in a globally hyperbolic spacetime @xmath6 , we have to point out another problem arising in @xcite .",
    "regular diamonds do not need to have arcwise connected causal complements .",
    "this , on the one hand creates some technical problems ; on the other hand it is not clear whether it is justified to assume haag duality on @xmath25 : the only known result showing that a net of local observables , in the presence of a nontrivial superselection structure , inherits haag duality from fields makes use of the arcwise connectedness of causal complements of the elements of the index set ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.15 ) .",
    "we start to deal with this problem by showing that net - cohomology is invariant under a change of the index set ( theorem [ adb:4 ] ) , provided the new index set is a refinement of @xmath21 ( see definition [ aca:1 ] and lemma [ adb:3]a ) . in section [ bb ]",
    "we introduce the set @xmath5 of diamonds of @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath5 is a refinement of @xmath21 and any element of @xmath5 has an arcwise connected causal complement . therefore adopting @xmath5 as index set the cited problems",
    "are overcome .",
    "+ in section [ c ] , we consider an irreducible net @xmath32 satisfying the borchers property and punctured haag duality .",
    "the key for studying superselection sectors of the net @xmath32 , namely the @xmath1category @xmath19 , is provided by the following fact .",
    "we introduce the causal puncture @xmath33 of @xmath5 induced by a point @xmath34 of @xmath6 ( [ bba:1 ] ) and consider the categories @xmath35 of 1-cocycles of @xmath33 , trivial in @xmath26 , with values in the net @xmath36 .",
    "we show that a family @xmath37 for any @xmath38 admits an extension to a 1-cocycle @xmath39 if , and only if , a suitable gluing condition is verified ( proposition [ ca:2 ] ) .",
    "a similar result holds for arrows ( proposition [ ca:4 ] ) , and can be easily generalized to functors .",
    "these results suggest that one could proceed as follows : first , prove that the categories @xmath35 have the right structure to describe the superselection theory ( _ local theory _ ,",
    "section [ cb ] ) ; secondly , check that the constructions we have made on @xmath35 satisfy the mentioned gluing condition , and consequently can be extended to @xmath19 ( _ global theory _ ,",
    "section [ cc ] ) .",
    "this argument works",
    ". we will prove that @xmath19 has a tensor product , a symmetry and that any object has left inverses .",
    "the full subcategory @xmath40 of @xmath19 whose objects have finite statistics has conjugates ( theorem [ cbc:11 ] ) .",
    "+ in appendix [ x ] we give some basics definitions and results on tensor @xmath1categories .",
    "after some preliminaries , the main topics are discussed in full generality in the first three sections : the first homotopy group of a poset ; the connection between homotopy and net - cohomology ; the behaviour of net - cohomology under a change of the index set . the remaining two sections are devoted to study the case that the poset is a basis for the topology of a topological space .",
    "we stress that the results obtained in the first three sections in terms of abstract posets can be applied , not only to sharply localized charges which are the subject of the present investigation , but also to charges like those studied in @xcite .      in the present section we recall the definition of simplicial set of a poset and",
