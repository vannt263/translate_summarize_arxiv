    "the concept of a soliton as a localized particle - like excitation that preserves its shape can be extended to systems that are far from thermodynamic equilibrium through the concept of a `` dissipative soliton '' @xcite .",
    "this allows us to analyze a broad range of physical , chemical , and biological nonlinear systems in which localized excitations are observed .",
    "driven magnetic systems , especially those of technological interest , exhibit strongly nonlinear dynamics and are an ideal experimental domain for exploring the dissipative soliton model .    in this paper , we provide an analytical theory for a novel , localized oscillation mode in a spin torque oscillator with a free layer having perpendicular magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the salient features of this mode include a frequency well below that of uniform ferromagnetic resonance , a weak dependence of frequency on bias current , and a precession angle at the maximal value of @xmath0 . combining numerical micromagnetic simulations with an asymptotic analysis of the equations of motion",
    ", we identify this mode as a dynamic , dissipative magnetic soliton that is closely related to the `` magnon droplet '' predicted by ivanov and kosevich in 1977 @xcite .",
    "the mode central region exhibits magnetization pointing nearly opposite to its equilibrium direction with a perimeter manifesting @xmath0 precession . from our asymptotic analysis",
    ", we derive conditions on perpendicular anisotropy and bias current for the nucleation and existence of the dissipative droplet . using our numerical simulations",
    ", we analyze the stability of the dissipative droplet soliton as a function of applied magnetic field , bias current , and spin torque asymmetry .",
    "solitons in conservative systems occur when nonlinear terms in the equation of motion balance the effects of dispersion @xcite .",
    "a classic example is a light pulse moving in a lossless optical fiber : the change of refractive index with frequency ( dispersion ) tends to make the pulse spread out , but for a certain pulse shape , the change of refractive index with light intensity due to the optical kerr effect ( nonlinearity ) exactly balances the dispersion .",
    "pulses having this shape can propagate without spreading and are called solitary waves or solitons .",
    "the balance between nonlinearity and dispersion typically allows for the existence of a continuous family of solitons that can be excited in the system , rather than a single solution . in the optical fiber example",
    ", the family can be parametrized , for example , by pulse amplitude , and there is a continuous range of amplitudes that satisfy the soliton balancing condition .",
    "dissipative solitons @xcite are characterized by an additional balancing condition between gain and loss that typically allows only a single solution for a given set of external parameters .",
    "although conservative soliton models can explain weakly nonlinear behavior seen in magnetic systems of exceptionally low damping @xcite , damping is not a small effect for many magnetic systems of both fundamental and technological interest . by combining classical soliton theory with bifurcation theory of nonlinear dynamics and concepts of self - organization @xcite ,",
    "the dissipative soliton concept provides a framework for describing a broad range of soliton - like behaviors . here",
    ", we apply this concept to a nanoscale ferromagnetic system in which both damping and a driving force ( spin torque ) are important .",
    "spin torque @xcite occurs when a current is driven through a structure with alternating magnetic and nonmagnetic layers in which spin - dependent conductance at the interfaces results in a spin - polarized electron flow .",
    "when the polarized electrons enter a ferromagnetic layer whose magnetization @xmath1 is not collinear with the electron spins , the transmitted spins are rotated toward @xmath1 and the angular momentum absorbed by the ferromagnetic layer is known as the spin torque .",
    "typical devices have two ferromagnetic layers through which current is driven : a thick `` fixed '' layer that determines the direction of electron polarization , and a thin `` free '' layer whose orientation can be readily changed by spin torque . for current of the appropriate polarity , spin torque opposes the intrinsic damping torque in the system , and currents above a threshold produce dynamic states in which @xmath1 of the free layer can be manipulated without applying a magnetic field . this effect has been used to control switching of nanoscale magnetic elements @xcite , with potential applications in computer memory and data storage . the effect has also been used to produce coherent , frequency - tunable microwave oscillations @xcite in a nanoscale device known as a spin torque oscillator ( sto ) , with potential applications in integrated microwave circuits for mixing and active phase control .",
    "recent reviews cover the physics of spin torque @xcite and its possible applications @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath1 in the presence of spin torque ( presented below ) are inherently nonlinear , and their full solution for a general case is often studied by use of numerical methods .",
    "analytical methods can sometimes be applied by invoking restrictions such as high symmetry , spatially uniform @xmath1 ( the `` macrospin '' model ) , and small precession amplitude ( small angle between @xmath1 and its equilibrium direction ) .",
    "these restricted cases have been used to explain experimental results with mixed success .",
    "the local nature of spin torque allows it to drive large amplitude excitations in which @xmath1 varies on the scale of the magnetic exchange length ( typically a few nanometers ) , something that applied magnetic fields can not do .",
    "as we show here , this regime of strongly nonlinear , strongly nonuniform , sustained magnetodynamics is amenable to theoretical examination using numerical and analytical approaches .",
    "this regime is also experimentally accessible in stos .",
    "we note that a different type of magnetic soliton generated by spin torque , called a spin wave `` bullet '' , was predicted by slavin and tiberkevich in 2005 to occur in the point - contact geometry with magnetic films exhibiting in - plane oriented anisotropy and in - plane applied magnetic field @xcite . for this case ,",
    "the precession frequency decreases with increasing current , which can result in localization if the frequency falls below the bottom of the spin wave band at the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) frequency .",
    "the weakly nonlinear bullet soliton is a solution to a nonlinear schrdinger type equation with third - order nonlinearity in the excitation amplitude . as such ,",
    "its predicted experimental signature consists of subtle shifts in microwave output frequency and threshold current relative to that expected for a non - localized mode .",
    "in contrast , the droplet soliton studied here exhibits dramatic differences in behavior from that of a non - localized mode .",
    "this is due to the fact that it is a strongly nonlinear solution of the full equations of motion , rather than simply a third order expansion .",
    "domain walls @xcite , magnetic bubbles @xcite , and vortices @xcite are examples of well studied , strongly nonlinear , localized structures that occur in magnetic materials .",
    "the droplet differs from these static structures in that it is inherently dynamic ; the frequency of spin precession within the droplet is always greater than zero . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) , non - topological droplet , but we note that droplets in two and three - dimensions come in topological flavors as well @xcite .    we begin in the next section by presenting an asymptotic analysis of the model equations for the dissipative droplet in a high - symmetry case .",
