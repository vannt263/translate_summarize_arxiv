    "three major effects and their interrelations need to be considered : mechanical , electrical , and magnetic . mechanical effects are generally modeled through kirchhoff , euler - bernoulli , or mindlin - timoshenko small displacement assumptions ; see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . to include electrical and magnetic effects , there are mainly three approaches : _",

    "approaches are widely used - see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these models completely exclude magnetic effects and their coupling with electrical and mechanical effects . in a electrostatic approach ,",
    "electrical effects are stationary , even though the mechanical equations are dynamic . in the case of quasi - static approach , magnetic effects are still ignored but electric charges have time dependence . the electromechanical coupling is not dynamic .",
    "a piezoelectric beam is an elastic beam with electrodes at its top and bottom surfaces , insulated at the edges ( to prevent fringing effects ) , and connected to an external electric circuit .",
    "( see figure [ pbeam ] ) .",
    "these are the simplest structures on which to study the interaction between the electrical and mechanical energy in these systems .",
    "it is experimentally observed that the magnetic effects are minor in the overall dynamics for polarized ceramics ( see the review article @xcite ) , and therefore these effects are ignored in piezoelectric beam models .",
    "a single piezoelectric beam either shrinks or extends when the electrodes are subjected to a voltage source . for a beam of length @xmath0 and thickness @xmath1 models derived by electrostatic and quasi - static approaches with the euler - bernoulli small displacement assumptions ( no damping ) describe the stretching motion as    [ or ]    align & v_tt-_1 v_xx = 0 , &   ( x , t)(0,l)^+ + & v(0,t)= 0 ,   _ 1 v_x(l , t)= - , & t^+ + & ( v , v)(x,0)=(v^0 , v^1 ) , & x    where @xmath2 denote mass density , elastic stiffness , and piezoelectric coefficients of the beam , respectively , @xmath3 denotes the voltage applied at the electrodes , and @xmath4 denotes the longitudinal displacement of the beam . in these models an elliptic - type differential equation for the electrical component is obtained due to gauss law [ maxwell ] . solving this equation and then substituting into the mechanical equations leads to the wave equation ( [ or ] ) .",
    "( see ( [ homo - vol ] ) with @xmath5 . )",
    "the system ( [ or ] ) is a well - posed boundary control problem on an appropriate sobolev space . as a side note ,",
    "both kirchhoff and mindlin - timoshenko small displacement assumptions yield the same stretching equations ( [ or ] ) . from the control theory point of view",
    ", it is well - known that a single wave equation ( [ or ] ) can be exactly controlled in the energy space ( therefore the uncontrolled system , i.e. @xmath6 is exactly observable ) . with a mechanical feedback controller in the form of boundary damping @xmath7 the solutions of the closed - loop system",

    "exact observability and exponential stabilizability if magnetic effects are included in the mathematical models is investigated in this paper . in the fully dynamic approach ,",
    "magnetic effects are included , and hence the wave behavior of the electromagnetic fields .",
    "we obtain a strongly coupled system of wave equations , one for stretching and one for magnetic effects .",
    "voltage control comes into the play through only one boundary condition at one end .",
    "the problem of exponentially stabilizability is essentially one of simultaneous stabilizability since a single control needs to stabilize two coupled wave equations .",
    "simultaneous control problems for wave and beam systems have been studied by a number of researchers , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite conditions for simultaneous exact controllability",
    "are obtained for decoupled systems with the same input function . in @xcite the controllability of coupled strings of different lengths connected at one end point is considered .",
    "it is shown that controllability in finite time , in a smaller space than the natural energy space , is determined by the ratios of the string lengths .",
    "simultaneous controllability for general networks are considered in @xcite .",
    "it is proven here that for almost all choices of system parameters a simple electrical feedback controller ( current flowing through the electrodes ) yields strong stability .",
    "however , for almost all system parameters , the uncontrolled system is not exactly observable in the energy space , and therefore there is no feedback @xmath3 that makes the system exponentially stabilizable in the energy space .",
    "finally , it is shown that the system can be exponentially stabilized only for a set of system parameters of lebesque measure zero .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively very different from the electrostatic or quasi - static models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec - ii ] , a variational approach is used to derive the model ; a system of partial differential equations that include magnetic effects . in section",
    "[ sec - iii ] , well - posedness of the model is shown and also and strong stabilizability for a class of parameters .",
    "strong stabilizability is achieved with a feedback operator that is dual to the control operator .",
    "this feedback is purely electrical .",
    "finally in section [ sec - iv ] observability and exponential stabilizability is shown to depend on system parameters .",

    "therefore @xmath26 and ( [ cons - eqq10 ] ) reduces to @xmath27 finally , for an euler - bernoulli beam , the shear stress @xmath28 .",
    "( see [ shear ] . )",

    "returning to the linear theory of euler - bernoulli beam small - displacement assumptions , the displacement field is @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 denote the longitudinal displacement of the center line , and transverse displacement of the beam , respectively . since",
    "@xmath66 then the only strain component is given by @xmath67      the magnetic energy is added to the lagrangian @xmath68 through maxwell s equations .",
    "let @xmath69 denote magnetic field vector , and @xmath70 denote body charge density , body current density , surface charge density , surface current density , voltage , magnetic permeability , and unit normal vector respectively .",

    "note that even though the displacement current @xmath75 is assumed to be non - zero in both quasi - static and fully dynamic approaches , the term @xmath90 is zero in quasi - static approach since @xmath91    in this paper , the third , dynamic , approach is used for the modeling of a piezoelectric beam .",
    "assume that there is neither external body charges nor body currents , i.e. , @xmath92 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath76 is perpendicular to the @xmath93 plane due to ( [ current_boun ] ) , and therefore @xmath76 has only the @xmath94component @xmath95 and it is only a function of @xmath96 this is simply because the surface current @xmath97 at the electrodes have only @xmath98component ( tangential ) and @xmath76 is perpendicular to both the outward normal vector ( @xmath99 or @xmath100 ) at the electrodes and @xmath101 also assume that @xmath102 and thus @xmath103 by ( [ cons - eqcon12 ] ) .",
