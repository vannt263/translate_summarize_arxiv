    "the low energy quasiparticle excitations of the @xmath0-wave superconducting phase of the high-@xmath2 cuprate superconductors are massless anisotropic dirac fermions .",
    "@xcite these dirac quasiparticles are easily excited in the vicinity of the four nodes , the four points on the two - dimensional fermi surface where the superconducting order parameter vanishes .",
    "the dominant carriers of heat at low temperature , quasiparticles are efficiently probed via low temperature thermal conductivity measurements , which have been performed extensively over the past decade .",
    "theory @xcite has shown that the massless dirac energy spectrum yields a low temperature limit where thermal conductivity is remarkably independent of disorder for small impurity density . in this limit ,",
    "known as the universal limit , thermal conductivity per cuo@xmath3 plane depends only on fundamental constants and the ratio of the fermi velocity , @xmath4 , to the @xmath5-space slope of the superconducting order parameter at the nodal points , @xmath6 .",
    "experiments @xcite have demonstrated this disorder - independence and used this result to extract the anisotropy ratio , @xmath7 , from low - temperature thermal transport data .    over the past few years",
    ", there has been a significant effort to grow and measure high quality cuprate samples in the underdoped regime of the superconducting phase , as well as the pseudogap phase that results from underdoping even further .",
    "several experimental groups have used high - resolution scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite to examine the electronic states of the underdoped cuprates at the atomic scale .",
    "these experiments , amongst others @xcite , have provided evidence that charge order coexists with @xmath0-wave superconductivity ( dsc ) in these materials .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown theoretically @xcite that coexisting charge order can significantly affect the quasiparticle spectrum of the superconductor , leading the system to become fully gapped for charge order of sufficient magnitude .",
    "if the quasiparticles are fully gapped ( no nodes ) , the dominant carriers of heat at low temperature are frozen out , which should have a dramatic effect on the universal - limit thermal conductivity .",
    "the purpose of our current analysis is to study the nature of this effect .",
    "we consider a particularly simple form of charge order , a conventional @xmath8-wave charge density wave ( cdw ) with a @xmath5-independent order parameter and a wave vector @xmath9 that doubles the unit cell .",
    "while the charge order in the underdoped cuprates may be of a more complex type , this simple model provides a place for us to start studying , phenomenologically , the effect of charge order on thermal transport in a @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "furthermore , since the experimentally observed @xcite cdw has a wave vector close to @xmath10 , it will generically have a second harmonic near @xmath1 .",
    "this harmonic can couple efficiently to the nodal quasiparticles because its wave vector nearly spans the separation between the nodes .",
    "@xcite the calculations presented in this paper can then be viewed as applying to this second harmonic .    while the charge order in the cuprates may turn on with underdoping",
    ", we simply add a cdw term to the dsc hamiltonian and turn on the charge order by hand , by increasing the magnitude of the cdw order parameter .",
    "we then calculate the universal limit thermal conductivity of the combined system , evaluating the effect of coexisting charge order on thermal transport .",
    "our goal is to identify signatures of the onset of charge order which may be observed with underdoping in low - temperature thermal conductivity measurements of the underdoped cuprates .",

    "as expected , the thermal conductivity takes the pure @xmath0-wave superconductor value for @xmath40 and drops to zero for @xmath50 , where the quasiparticle energy spectrum has become fully gapped . for intermediate values of @xmath23 , @xmath237 and @xmath233",
    "differ , as square symmetry has been broken by the charge density wave . for transport in the direction of the charge density wave vector , @xmath237 vanishes continuously as @xmath23 approaches @xmath52 .",
    "by contrast , for transport perpendicular to the charge density wave vector , @xmath233 diverges before dropping abruptly to zero at @xmath52 .",
    "this divergence is a consequence of the clean limit and is replaced by a finite peak in the presence of disorder .    for the more complicated case of nonzero disorder ( @xmath251 ) and/or anisotropic nodes ( @xmath252 ) ,",
    "we have obtained results via a numerical calculation .",
    "we find that disorder smoothes out the transition to zero thermal conductivity across the nodal collision ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa0gamma0 ] ) .",
    "the clean - limit divergence in @xmath233 just before the transition is replaced by a peak which broadens and decreases in amplitude with increasing disorder .",
    "the abrupt drop in the clean - limit @xmath237 is similarly broadened . essentially , the disorder - broadening of the quasiparticle spectral function averages over what was , in the clean limit , a sharp transition from gapless to gapped quasiparticles .",
    "we find that increased nodal anisotropy has a similar effect , amplifying the disorder effect and thereby further broadening the features in the @xmath23-dependence of the thermal conductivity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : kappa0alpha ] ) . and",
    "the fact that disorder has an effect indicates that the low - temperature thermal conductivity is no longer universal ( disorder - independent ) in the presence of charge order , which is in line with the results of recent measurements @xcite of low - temperature thermal transport in the underdoped cuprates .    in these calculations ,",
    "we have enjoyed the theorist s luxury of being able to turn on , by hand , a charge density wave to coexist with the @xmath0-wave superconductivity .",
    "the experimenter does not have direct access to such a knob .",
    "however , in the @xmath0-wave superconducting state of the cuprates , charge order does appear to be enhanced with underdoping .",
    "hence the features of the @xmath23-dependent thermal conductivity curves calculated herein should serve as signatures for the underdoping - dependence of thermal conductivity measured in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "of course , most dramatic would be the observation of the nodal collision beyond which the low - temperature thermal conductivity drops to zero .",
    "however , even if the amplitude of charge order is insufficient to reach the nodal collision , these results should provide insight to the approach to the transition .",
    "a sequel to this work , exploring the effects of a more elaborate model of disorder , as well as the contribution of vertex corrections , is in preparation @xcite .",
    "future work will also examine the effect of different types of charge order ( beyond the conventional @xmath8-wave case considered here ) of different wave vector ( beyond the unit - cell - doubling @xmath117 case considered here ) and of multiple wave vectors ( like the checkerboard charge order observed in some cuprates @xcite ) .",

    "( [ eq : basis ] ) for the hamiltonian and green s functions .",
    "this choice of basis provides a compact realization of the hamiltonian and is quite convenient in many respects .",
    "however , use of a matrix green s function does introduce some subtleties regarding the spectral representation , and we would like to address those here .",
    "all of our results could have been obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian from the outset and working with the diagonalized green s function @xmath253 with diagonal matrix elements @xmath254_{nn } = \\frac{1}{i\\omega - e_k^{(n ) } - \\sigma^{(n)}(i\\omega ) } \\label{eq : gdiagelements}\\ ] ] where the @xmath255 are the eigenvalues of @xmath38 , the @xmath256 are the corresponding self - energies , and the eigenvectors define the columns of unitary transformation matrix @xmath257 . in the diagonal basis , it is quite valid to define a spectral representation for the green s function @xmath258 where @xmath259 = -\\frac{1}{\\pi } \\mbox{im }",

    "( [ eq : gdiagelements ] ) .    the non - diagonal matrix green s function can therefore be expressed as @xmath262 which is not equivalent to the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : specrep ] ) @xmath263}{i\\omega-\\omega_1 } \\label{eq : gspecrep}\\ ] ] unless the diagonalization transformation commutes with taking the imaginary part .",
