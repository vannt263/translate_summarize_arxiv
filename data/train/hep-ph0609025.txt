    "leptogenesis is perhaps the most attractive model for generating the matter - antimatter asymmetry in our universe @xcite after inflation .",
    "the process generates a lepton asymmetry via the production and subsequent decay of a heavy majorana neutrino .",
    "this lepton asymmetry is partially converted to a baryon asymmetry via sphaleron processes @xcite which break both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , but conserve @xmath2 .",
    "the fraction of @xmath2 that ends up in @xmath0 by the sphaleron processes is given by @xmath3 giving @xmath4 where the @xmath5 is created by leptogenesis which gives a non zero value of @xmath1 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "in its simplest form ( within the context of the see - saw model ) leptogenesis consists of adding three heavy right - handed neutrinos to the standard model . in the hierarchical limit one of these right handed neutrinos , @xmath6 ,",
    "is much lighter than the other two and the leptogenesis mechanism consists essentially of the process @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a light , left - handed neutrino and @xmath9 the higgs .",
    "all light flavours behave identically , so you can think of the other light flavours as included as a factor of @xmath10 in the decay rate . because of loop corrections there can be @xmath11 violation in the decay , usually quantified by the asymmetry parameter @xmath12 . in the following",
    "we denote the heavy neutrino by @xmath13 , the light by @xmath1 , and the higgs by @xmath14 .",
    "this model has been studied extensively in the literature , including deviations from the hierarchical limit , thermal corrections etc @xcite .",
    "however , all studies have used the integrated boltzmann equation to follow the evolution of the heavy neutrino number density and the lepton asymmetry .",
    "this approach assumes maxwell - boltzmann statistics for all particles as well as kinetic equilibrium for the heavy species .",
    "this assumption is normally justified in freeze - out calculations where elastic scattering is assumed to be much faster than inelastic reactions . however , in the present context , kinetic equilibrium in the heavy species would have to be maintained by the decays and inverse decays alone .",
    "therefore it is not obvious that the integrated boltzmann equation is always a good approximation .",
    "furthermore @xmath15 processes are generally inefficient for thermalization compared with @xmath16 processes . for @xmath17 deviations from kinetic equilibrium are always of order 20% or less @xcite , but for @xmath15 processes they can be very large ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite for a case where deviation from equilibrium is extremely large ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate how the use of the full boltzmann equation affects the final lepton asymmetry in a simplified model with only decays and inverse decays and resonant scattering .",
    "we will return to the point of resonant scattering in due course .",
    "we find that when @xmath18 the difference can be very large .",
    "however , at small temperature where the inverse decay dominates the difference decreases in magnitude to about 20% .",
    "here we study only the two - body decay of a heavy right - handed neutrino to a light neutrino plus a higgs .",
    "we do not include thermal corrections to the particle masses , so that for instance the process @xmath19 is not kinematically possible .",
    "we assume that the asymmetry , represented by @xmath20 is small , so that when we calculate anything with @xmath13 , we can assume identical distributions of @xmath1 and @xmath21 .",
    "we consider only initial zero abundance of @xmath13 .",
    "we use only single particle distribution functions , in which case the boltzmann equation for the heavy species can be written as @xcite    @xmath22,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and for the light neutrino it is @xmath23,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a similar equation for @xmath21 .",
    "the interesting boltzmann equations for the present purpose are those for @xmath13 and for @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath24 have gauge interactions which are very fast .",
    "this means that @xmath14 can be described by a distribution in chemical equilibrium , and that @xmath24 can be described as distributions in kinetic equilibrium , @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "using cpt - invariance , following the idea of @xcite , we find @xmath27 , \\nonumber \\label{eq : r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the total rest frame decay rate . the corresponding equation for @xmath29 to @xmath0 conversion during the decay process because we track only @xmath29 .",
    "including it would have only a modest effect on our numerical results .",
    "] is @xmath30 , \\label{eq : l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to first order in @xmath12 and with @xmath31    since we have so far only included @xmath32 processes , eq .",
    "[ eq : l ] suffers from the well - known problem of lepton asymmetry generation even in equilibrium @xcite . to remedy this problem the resonant part of the @xmath33",
    "must be included .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath12 this amounts to adding the term @xmath34 in eq .",
    "[ eq : l ] @xcite , so that the final form of the equation for the lepton asymmetry is @xmath35 , \\nonumber \\label{eq : l2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this equation does not exhibit any lepton asymmetry generating behaviour in thermal equilibrium because @xmath36 = 0 $ ] explicitly .",
    "to first order in @xmath37 equations eq .",
    "[ eq : r ] and [ eq : l2 ] can be easily integrated numerically for given values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "if maxwell - boltzmann statistics and kinetic equilibrium for @xmath13 are assumed the equations can be further simplified .",
    "the integrated boltzmann equations are then    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the thermally averaged total decay rate .",
    "these equations are the ones normally used in leptogenesis calculations for the simplest case of one massive and one light neutrino .",
    "however , compared with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : r]-[eq : l2 ] ) they involve the approximation of assuming maxwell - boltzmann statistics and kinetic equilibrium . particularly for the case",
    "where @xmath43 this approximation is not necessarily good .",
    "when decays and inverse decays are included ( as well as gauge interactions of @xmath1 and @xmath14 which establish kinetic equilibrium for @xmath24 , and @xmath14 individually , but which conserve @xmath29 ) there are essentially only two interesting parameters .",
    "all terms that contribute to the development of densities are proportional to either @xmath14 or @xmath39 .",
    "this competition can be parameterised by the single parameter @xmath44 , the decay parameter .",
    "the other important parameter is the net decay asymmetry @xmath12 .    in the present study",
    "we assume that the heavy neutrinos start with zero abundance , i.e.  that they are not equilibrated at high temperatures through other interactions .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a thorough discussion of the various possibilities for initial @xmath13 abundance .    in figs",
    ". 1 - 3 we show a calculation of @xmath45 and the net asymmetry for different values of @xmath46 . at high temperatures",
    "the equilibration rate of @xmath13 is much higher when the full boltzmann equation is used .",
    "the main reason for this can be seen in fig .",
    "4 . when @xmath47 the low momentum states of @xmath13 are populated very efficiently , while there is little population of high momentum modes . this in turn means that the inverse decay @xmath48 is suppressed relative to the decay process @xmath49 .    to quantify this , we want to define a momentum dependant inverse decay rate , @xmath50 the efficiency with which @xmath13 states with momentum @xmath51 are produced from the background ( ignoring decays and pauli blocking ) is then given by @xmath52\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this function is sharply peaked at low momentum with the following limiting behaviour @xmath53 this is a steeply increasing function of @xmath54 and at low temperatures when @xmath55 the distribution of @xmath13 is in complete equilibrium and @xmath56 so that the boltzmann approximation is valid . therefore the curves for @xmath57 approach each other in figs .  1 - 3 .",
    "note , however , that the highest @xmath51 modes are always out of equilibrium because of the asymptotic @xmath58 term .",
    "in fact for given values of @xmath54 and @xmath46 there will be a limiting value of @xmath51 above which the distribution will be out of equilibrium . in fig .",
    "5 we show the value of @xmath59 for which @xmath60 as a function of @xmath54 , for the specific case of @xmath61 . at high temperatures no momentum states are in equilibrium , whereas at low temperatures only progressively higher momentum states are out of equilibrium .",
    "this figure corresponds well to what is shown in fig .",
    "4 . for @xmath62 no states are in equilibrium , for @xmath63 states above @xmath64 are not yet in equilibrium , and for @xmath65 almost all states",
    "have been populated to their equilibrium value .    as can be seen in figs .",
    "1 - 3 the net asymmetry also grows much more rapidly initially when the full boltzmann equation is used , and the change of sign occurs at higher temperature .",
    "however , at low temperatures the differences are smaller .    in fig .",
    "6 we show the ratio of the final asymmetry in the two cases @xmath66    as can be seen from fig .  6 there can be a significant difference in the asymmetry between the two approaches . for very high values of @xmath46",
    "the difference is small because the distribution is kept very close to kinetic equilibrium ( for a fermi - dirac distribution ) throughout the decay .",
    "note , however , that the difference never goes to zero .",
    "the reason is that the thermal decay width is changed relative to the maxwell - boltzmann approximation when pauli blocking and stimulated emission factors are included ( as also noted by @xcite ) . for smaller values of @xmath46",
    "the difference increases and can be as large as 50% .",
    "however , it should be noted that our framework will break down for small values of @xmath46 because we have not included scattering .",
    "another important point to note is that @xmath67 does not depend on @xmath12 because the deviation from kinetic equilibrium is governed completely by the total decay rate ( i.e.  by @xmath46 ) , not by the asymmetry , as long as @xmath68 .",
    "we are only interested in the final value of the asymmetry since , in order to maximise the baryon asymmetry for any given value of @xmath12 , we want leptogenesis to end before the conversion through sphalerons end .",
    "we have solved the full boltzmann equation for decays and inverse decays to follow the generation of lepton asymmetry during leptogenesis .",
    "when decays are semi - relativistic the difference between using the full boltzmann equation and the standard integrated boltzmann equation can be very large .",
    "however , at low temperature where washout dominates the difference is relatively modest .",
    "the difference at @xmath69 is less than about 30% between the two approaches . for smaller @xmath46",
    "the difference can be larger . however , this is the regime where @xmath15 processes do not dominate , i.e.  outside the regime in which our framework is valid .",
    "the conclusion is that the boltzmann approximation yields results in the strong washout regime which are accurate to at least 30% . for @xmath70",
    "the difference is not larger than 15% .",
