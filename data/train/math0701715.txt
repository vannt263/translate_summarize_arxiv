    "the purpose of this paper is twofold : to provide the classification of varieties of quasigroups of bol - moufang type , and to demonstrate that the equational reasoning and finite model builder software currently available is powerful enough to answer questions of interest in mathematics .    since we hope to attract the attention of both mathematicians and computer scientists , we give the necessary background for both groups .",
    "recall that a class @xmath2 of universal algebras of the same type is a _ variety _ if it is closed under products , subalgebras , and homomorphic images .",
    "equivalently , @xmath2 is a variety if and only if it consists of all universal algebras of the same type satisfying some identities .    generally speaking , to establish inclusions between varieties ( or sets )",
    ", it suffices to use only two types of arguments :    1 .",
    "given varieties @xmath3 , @xmath4 , show that @xmath5 .",
    "2 .   given varieties @xmath3 , @xmath4 ,",
    "decide if there is @xmath6 .    throughout this paper",
    ", the varieties will be varieties of quasigroups defined by a single bol - moufang identity .",
    "thus , if @xmath7 is the identity defining @xmath3 , and @xmath8 is the identity defining @xmath9 , then to establish ( i ) it suffices to show that @xmath7 implies @xmath8 .",
    "we use the equational reasoning tool ` otter ` @xcite to assist with some of these proofs . as for (",
    "ii ) , we use the finite model builder ` mace4 ` @xcite to find algebras @xmath10 in @xmath11 .",
    "we call such algebras @xmath10 _ distinguishing examples_.    the computer - generated ` otter ` proofs are cumbersome and difficult to read ; we do not include them in this paper .",
    "however , all have been carefully organized and are available electronically at @xcite . to be able to read and understand @xcite , see section [ sc : otter ] .",
    "a set @xmath12 with binary operation @xmath13 is a _ quasigroup _ if the equation @xmath14 has a unique solution in @xmath12 whenever two of the three elements @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are given .",
    "note that multiplication tables of finite quasigroups are exactly latin squares .",
    "an element @xmath18 is called the _ left @xmath19right@xmath20 neutral element _ of @xmath12 if @xmath21 @xmath22 holds for every @xmath23 .",
    "an element @xmath18 is the _ neutral element _ if @xmath24 holds for every @xmath23 . in this paper",
    ", we use the term _ left @xmath19right@xmath20 loop _ for a quasigroup with a left ( right ) neutral element .",
    "a _ loop _ is a quasigroup with a neutral element .",
    "hence loops are precisely ` not necessarily associative groups ' , as can also be seen from the lattice of varieties depicted in figure [ fg : lattice ] .",
    "( recall that a _",
    "semigroup _ is an associative groupoid , and a _ monoid _ is a semigroup with a neutral element . )    the above definition of a quasigroup can not be written in terms of identities , as it involves existential quantifiers .",
    "fortunately , as is the tradition in the field , it is possible to introduce a certain kind of universal algebra with 3 binary operations axiomatized by identities ( hence forming a variety ) that describes the same objects .",
    "the _ variety of quasigroups _ consists of universal algebras @xmath25 whose binary operations @xmath13 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 satisfy @xmath28 it is customary to think of @xmath29 as division of @xmath16 by @xmath15 on the left , and of @xmath30 as division of @xmath15 by @xmath16 on the right .",
    "note that @xmath29 is the unique solution to the equation @xmath31 , and similarly for @xmath32 .",
    "this latter description of quasigroups is necessary if one wants to work with equational reasoning software , such as ` otter ` .",
    "we are coming to the title definition of this paper .",
    "an identity @xmath33 is of _ bol - moufang type _ if ( i ) the only operation in @xmath34 , @xmath35 is @xmath13 , ( ii ) the same 3 variables appear on both sides , in the same order , ( iii ) one of the variables appears twice on both sides , ( iv ) the remaining two variables appear once on both sides .",
    "for instance , @xmath36 is an identity of bol - moufang type .",
    "a systematic notation for identities of bol moufang type was introduced in @xcite , and will be reviewed in section [ sc : sn ] .",
    "a variety of quasigroups ( loops ) is said to be of _ bol - moufang _ type if it is defined by one additional identity of bol - moufang type .",
    "we say that two identities ( of bol - moufang type ) are _ equivalent _ if they define the same variety .",
    "this definition must be understood relative to some underlying variety , since two identities can be equivalent for loops but not for quasigroups , as we shall see .",
    "several well - known varieties of loops are of bol - moufang type .",
    "their classification was initiated by fenyves in @xcite , @xcite , and completed by the authors in @xcite .",
    "none of these three papers required computer calculations . however , shortly after this current project was undertaken , it became obvious that the situation for varieties of quasigroups of bol - moufang type is more intricate and complex .",
    "that is why we opted for presenting the results in this format , with the lengthier computer - generated proofs omitted .",
    "our investigations were aided by the automated reasoning tool ` otter ` and by the finite model builder ` mace4 ` @xcite , both developed by william mccune ( argonne ) . ` otter ` implements the knuth - bendix algorithm , and has proven to be effective at equational reasoning @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for more about ` otter ` s technical specifications , as well as links to results assisted by ` otter ` and ` mace4 ` . a self - contained , elementary introduction to ` otter ` can be found in @xcite .",
    "many authors simply use the ` otter ` output file as the proof of a theorem ; it is common practice to publish untranslated ` otter ` proofs @xcite .",
    "this is mathematically sound since the program can be made to output a simple _ proof object _ , which can be independently verified by a short `",
    "lisp ` program .",
    "we have posted all proofs omitted in this paper at @xcite . in the proofs at @xcite , `` para_into '' and",
    "`` para_from '' are short for `` paramodulation into '' and `` paramodulation from '' , and they are the key steps in any ` otter ` proof . very crudely , paramodulation is an inference rule that combines variable instantiation and equality substitution into one step @xcite .",
    "the proofs generated by ` otter ` contain all information necessary for their translation into human language ; nevertheless , they are not easy to read .",
    "this is because ` otter ` often performs several nontrivial substitutions at once .",
    "many of the proofs can be made significantly shorter , especially with some knowledge of the subject available , however , some proofs appear to be rather clever even after being translated . in other words , one often obtains no insight into the problem upon seing the ` otter ` proof .",
    "we would be happy to see more intuitive proofs , but we did not feel that they are necessary for our programme . if the reader wants to come up with such proofs , he / she should be aware of the standard techniques of the field , such as autotopisms , pseudo - automorphisms , and their calculus @xcite , @xcite .",
    "` mace4 ` is a typical finite model builder .",
    "thus , given a finite set of identities ( or their negations ) , it attempts to construct a universal algebra satisfying all of the identities .",
    "given the huge number of nonisomorphic ( or nonisotopic ) quasigroups of even small orders ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , it is not easy to construct such examples by hand , without some theory . `",
    "mace4 ` was therefore invaluable for the purposes of this work , specifically section [ sc : de ] .",
    "the following notational conventions will be used throughout the paper . we omit @xmath13 while multiplying two elements ( eg @xmath37 ) , and reserve @xmath13 to indicate priority of multiplication ( eg @xmath38 ) . also , we declare @xmath39 and @xmath40 to be less binding than the omitted multiplication ( eg @xmath41 ) , and if @xmath13 is used , we consider it to be less binding than any other operation ( eg @xmath42 ) .",
    "let @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 be all the variables appearing in an identity of bol - moufang type . without loss of generality , we can assume that they appear in the terms in alphabetical order .",
    "then there are exactly @xmath46 ways in which the @xmath47 variables can form a word of length @xmath48 , and there are exactly @xmath49 ways in which a word of length @xmath48 can be bracketed , namely : @xmath50 let @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 be the identity whose variables are ordered according to @xmath2 , whose left - hand side is bracketed according to @xmath54 , and whose right - hand side is bracketed according to @xmath55 . for instance",
    ", @xmath56 is the identity @xmath57 .",
    "it is now clear that any identity of bol - moufang type can be transformed into some identity @xmath51 by renaming the variables and interchanging the left - hand side with the right - hand side .",
    "there are therefore @xmath58 `` different '' identities of bol - moufang type , as noted already in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the _ dual _ of an identity @xmath59 is the identity obtained from @xmath59 by reading it backwards , i.e. , from right to left .",
    "for instance , the dual of @xmath60 is the identity @xmath61 . with the above conventions in mind , we can rewrite the latter identity as @xmath62 .",
    "one can therefore identify the dual of any identity @xmath51 with some identity @xmath63 .",
    "the name @xmath64 of the dual of @xmath51 is easily calculated with the help of the following rules : @xmath65",
    "table [ tb : definitions ] defines @xmath1 varieties of quasigroups .",
    "as we shall see , these varieties form the complete list of quasigroup varieties of bol - moufang type .",
    "@xmath66    we have carefully chosen the defining identities in such a way that they are either self - dual ( gr , eq , cq , fq , mnq ) or coupled into dual pairs ( lx@xmath67=rx ) . the only exception to this rule is the moufang identity @xmath68 .",
    "we will often appeal to this duality .",
    "the reasoning behind the names of the new varieties in table [ tb : definitions ] is as follows : if any of the quasigroups lgi , rgi is a loop , it becomes a group ; if any of the quasigroups lci , rci is a loop , it becomes an lc - loop , rc - loop , respectively .",
    "all of this will be clarified in the next section .",
    "although we will use the new names and abbreviations of table [ tb : definitions ] for the rest of the paper , the reader is warned that other names exist in the literature .",
    "fenyves @xcite assigned numbers to the @xmath69 identities of bol - moufang type in a somewhat random way , and kunen @xcite developed a different systematic notation that does not reflect inclusions between varieties .",
    "our notation is an extension of @xcite .",
    "the varieties of loops of bol - moufang type were fully described in @xcite .",
    "the situation is summarized in figure [ fg : ltree]a hasse diagram of varieties of loops of bol - moufang type . for every variety in the diagram we give : the name of the variety , abbreviation of the name , defining identity , and all equivalent bol - moufang identities defining the variety .",
    "inclusions among varieties are indicated by their relative position and connecting lines , as is usual in a hasse diagram .",
    "the higher a variety is in figure [ fg : ltree ] , the smaller it is .",
    "we use figure [ fg : ltree ] as the starting point for our investigation of the quasigroup case .",
    "our first task is to determine which quasigroup varieties of bol - moufang type are equivalent .",
    "clearly , if two identities are equivalent for quasigroups , they must also be equivalent for loops , but not _ vice versa_.",
    "the results can be found in figure [ fg : qtree ] .",
    "( note that the right half of figure [ fg : qtree ] is dual to the left side , with the exception of cq .",
    "the @xmath49 varieties in the middle and cq are self - dual . )",
    "actually , all sets of equivalent identities in figure [ fg : qtree ] are maximal equivalent sets , but we will not verify the maximality yet .",
    "( see section [ sc : ids ] . )",
    "let us go through diagram [ fg : qtree ] and comment on it .",
    "we note that there is nothing to show if we list a single identity for a given variety in figure [ fg : qtree ] , since we merely need to show that all identities in a given box of figure [ fg : qtree ] are equivalent .",
    "this takes care of @xmath70 varieties .",
    "kunen @xcite showed that the identities @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath68 , @xmath73 are equivalent for quasigroups , hence settling mq .",
    "he also showed that the three eq identities @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 are equivalent @xcite .",
    "we will talk more about these results in section [ sc : ids ] .",
    "all identities listed under _",
    "gr _ in figure @xmath77 are equivalent , and imply associativity .",
    "it is very easy to show , just as we did in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.1 ) , that all the identities with the exception of @xmath78 and @xmath79 imply associativity .",
    "( to show that @xmath78 implies associativity , we took advantage of a neutral element in @xcite . )",
    "assume that a quasigroup @xmath12 satisfies @xmath78 .",
    "we will first show that @xmath12 possesses a right neutral element .",
    "substitute @xmath80 for @xmath45 in @xmath78 to obtain @xmath81 with @xmath82 instead of @xmath43 and @xmath44 instead of @xmath45 we obtain @xmath83 this means that @xmath84 is independent of @xmath44 , and is the right neutral element of @xmath12 .",
    "since @xmath85 , too , the right neutral element can be written as @xmath86 .",
    "now , @xmath87 implies @xmath88 which , with @xmath89 instead of @xmath44 , implies @xmath90 since @xmath91 , we can use @xmath92 instead of @xmath45 in @xmath93 to get @xmath94 finally , from @xmath95 , we have @xmath96 we now show that @xmath97 , which is equivalent to saying that @xmath98 , or , that @xmath92 is the neutral element of @xmath12 .",
    "the associativity of the loop @xmath12 then easily follows , just as in @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath99 , by one of the quasigroup axioms . using @xmath100 with @xmath44 instead of @xmath43 and @xmath101 instead of @xmath44 ,",
    "we can write @xmath102 by @xmath103 , the right - hand side can be written as @xmath104 by @xmath105 with @xmath106 instead of @xmath43 and @xmath92 instead of @xmath45 , this is equal to @xmath107 , and we are through .",
    "each of the three _ fq _ quasigroup identities @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 is equivalent to flexibility .    by duality",
    ", it suffices to show that @xmath108 is equivalent to flexibility , and that @xmath109 is equivalent to flexibility .",
    "cancel @xmath45 on the right in @xmath108 to obtain flexibility .",
    "substituting @xmath111 for @xmath112 in @xmath109 yields flexibility .",
    "flexibility clearly implies both @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",

    "* thms . 1 , 2 ) .",
    "each of the _ laq _ identities @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 is equivalent to the left alternative law .",
    "it is easy to see that any of these three identities implies the left alternative law ( e.g. let @xmath118 in @xmath115 , cancel @xmath45 on the right in @xmath116 , cancel @xmath43 on the left in @xmath117 ) . with the left alternative law available",
    ", all three identities clearly hold .",
    "in 1996 , kunen @xcite discovered the surprising fact that a moufang quasigroup is necessarily a ( moufang ) loop .",
    "in other words , if a quasigroup @xmath12 satisfies any of the moufang identities ( cf . mq in figure [ fg : qtree ] ) , it possesses a neutral element .",
    "he then went on to investigate this property for many quasigroups of bol - moufang type @xcite .",
    "since we wish to translate the diagram [ fg : ltree ] into the quasigroup case , we need to know which of the quasigroup varieties defined in table [ tb : definitions ] are in fact loop varieties",

    "we get many distinguishing examples for free by taking advantage of the existence of ( one - sided ) neutral elements in the varieties under consideration .",
