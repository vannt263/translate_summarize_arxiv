    "humanoid robots have increasingly been used in complex environments to make the use of such robots more feasible in human life .",
    "one of the most important aspects in these environments is , therefore , the dexterous manipulation of humanoid redundant arm systems .",
    "redundancy is almost a prerequisite in such cases because it can be used to manipulate objects in human environments dexterously .",
    "however , the motion of any such redundant arm systems is complex mainly because there is no one - to - one correspondence between the task - space and joint - space of the robot . this is because when the task - space motions are mapped to joint - space to input the required commands to the robots , the mapping is not unique and hence , many solutions exist .",
    "this , however , poses an opportunity to select a single solution out of those multiple solutions which satisfies some of the other possible task requirements such as obstacle avoidance and specific motion characteristics .",
    "thus , several studies have been conducted to utilize this aspect of redundancy in the manipulation of objects in complex environments@xcite-@xcite .    many studies@xcite-@xcite attempt to control the motion of redundant systems by segregating the motion space into two subspaces such as the task - space motion component and the null - space motion component and by controlling these according to desired performance objectives .",
    "one of the advantages of this method is that the task - space component can be commanded to reach a desired task objective while the null - space component can be separately controlled for redundancy resolution in order to enhance a specific performance criteria without affecting the task - space objective .",
    "however , in spite of this promising method , position regulation in complex dynamic environments full of obstacles has not yet been completely successful mainly because of the highly non - linear nature of uncertainties present in the robot dynamics as well as the inability to avoid all the obstacles in such proximity .",
    "though model - based uncertainty compensation techniques and model - less disturbance observers have been used by researchers@xcite-@xcite , these methods have still not been able to achieve the desired performance largely because of inaccurate models or non - linear nature of robot dynamics .",
    "this report hence employs a non - linear disturbance observer in the task - space for position regulation of redundant robot arms in spite of interactions with obstacles in complex 3d environments wherein obstacle avoidance is not possible .",
    "we , however , assume that no obstacles lie directly on the trajectory of the end - effector in which case obstacle avoidance is a must .",
    "however , obstacles may lie very near to the trajectory and hence , the robot s non - terminal links might interact with the obstacles depending on the configuration of the robot .",
    "we also assume that the interactions with the obstacles do not affect the stability of the robot and only changes the joint trajectory .",
    "this assumption is quite practical for soft environments and compliant robot arms .",
    "henceforth , we shall refer to these unwanted interactions as perturbations in the environment .",
    "we have used a 7-dof redundant robot as our simulation test bed .",
    "a modified version of the newton - euler algorithm has been implemented to compute the detailed non - linearities of the robot dynamics and to use it in the task - space disturbance observer .",
    "results verify the efficacy of our algorithm for effective position regulation in such complex environments .",
    "in addition to this , this report also compares these results with that of a conventional task - space disturbance observer with a simplistic mass - damper lumped model as the nominal model without considering the non - linearities .",
    "simulations are then conducted in a real - time simulation software called _ roboticslab _ and the results show the efficacy of the proposed scheme as compared to the conventional scheme . _ the links to the video of the above simulation result is provided in the section [ sec : result ] . _    to further prove the significance of the proposed method , it is applied to a controller which exhibits human - like characteristics for reaching motion .",
    "arbitrary perturbations are introduced in the robotic system which affect the joint trajectories of the robot arm .",
    "however , results show that the robot end - effector successfully continues to move along the human - like quasi - straight trajectory for reaching its target using the proposed scheme in spite of the perturbations .",
    "these results are also compared to the unperturbed motion of the robot arm which show the significance of the developed method .",
    "position regulation , generally , becomes difficult if perturbations are present in an environment .",
    "however , it is possible to maintain a particular position in spite of these perturbations in the joint space by utilizing the dynamics of the inherent redundancy in a system .",
    "a perturbation in an environment can be usually represented as an external force / torque acting on the system . hence",
    ", theoretically if any external force applied changes only the configuration of the internal robot joints without moving the end - effector , accurate position regulation might be possible provided all other non - linear uncertainties in the robotic system are well compensated .",
    "the next sub - sections on robot dynamics will show us as to how this can be achieved .      any robot manipulator operating in real environment",
    "is affected by the inertial , coriolis , gravity , and friction effects as well as external force influence .",
    "therefore , the general dynamic equation of any robot behavior can be written in joint - space in the form of    @xmath0    where @xmath1 denotes a symmetric , positive definite robot inertia matrix , @xmath2 is the coriolis and centrifugal vector , @xmath3 is the gravity vector , @xmath4 is the friction component and @xmath5 is the external force acting on the manipulator joint .",
    "the coriolis and centrifugal term in ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be factorized as    @xmath6    where @xmath7 holds the skew - symmetric property given in ( [ eq:3 ] ) and is calculated from christoffel symbols of the second kind .",
    "@xmath8    hence , the resultant general dynamic equation is given by    @xmath9    if we choose to model the redundant robot manipulator as a simple linear mass - damper system such as @xmath10 , then the disturbance torque @xmath11 to the system is given by ( [ eq:5 ] ) which will be eventually canceled by any joint - space disturbance observer , if applied .",
    "@xmath12    hence , as evident from ( [ eq:5 ] ) , any disturbance observer in joint - space cancels the external force / torque because it is considered as a disturbance itself along with the variation in inertial parameters , coriolis , friction and gravity effects .",
    "if this were to be implemented in perturbed environments , theoretically , the robot arm will continue to hit the obstacles subsequently after it hits those obstacles for the first time because it will tend to come back to its original configuration just before it was perturbed .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to come up with an alternative formulation through which position regulation is possible and the task - space objectives can be achieved in spite of the presence of unwanted interactions with obstacles and non - linear uncertainties in the system .",
    "an alternative can be to express the dynamics using the task - space formulation and apply a disturbance observer in the operational space which can cancel the disturbances in the task - space only .",
    "the general dynamic equation of a multi degree - of - freedom robot manipulator in the task - space can be derived from the joint - space equation shown in ( [ eq:5 ] ) as given in ( [ eq:6 ] ) and ( [ eq:7])@xcite . please note that the friction effects are neglected .",
    "@xmath13    where    @xmath14{\\bm{j}_m^{+ } } , \\hfill \\\\",

    "@xmath17 is the jacobian matrix and @xmath18 is the moore - penrose pseudoinverse of the jacobian matrix which is weighted by the inverse of the inertia matrix @xmath19 . by substituting ( [ eq:7 ] ) in ( [ eq:6 ] ) and by expressing @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ", we have the following .",
    "@xmath22    which can be rewritten from the relation @xmath23 as given below .",
    "@xmath24    therefore , if we neglect the friction forces , then from ( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:9 ] ) , we have ( [ eq:10 ] ) .",
    "@xmath25    since , @xmath26 , hence ,    @xmath27    when the above task - space command input is mapped back to joint - space , a null - space projection component arises in redundant manipulators and hence , the general solution of ( [ eq:11 ] ) is given by ( [ eq:12 ] ) .",
    "this is because @xmath28 is the right pseudo - inverse of @xmath29 weighted by @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the second term in ( [ eq:12 ] ) represents the required null - space projection component .",
    "@xmath31    where @xmath32 is a vector of arbitrary torques which does not contribute to end - effector forces and motion .",
    "now , if a disturbance observer is applied in the task - space , ( [ eq:12 ] ) is modified to ( [ eq:13 ] ) .",
    "@xmath33    where @xmath34 is given by ( [ eq:14 ] ) if the nominal model of the robot manipulator is given by @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36    therefore , ( [ eq:13 ] ) becomes ( [ eq:15 ] ) or ( [ eq:16 ] ) and thus the external torques acting on the robot - manipulator due to unwanted interactions with obstacles , can be isolated .",
    "these can , eventually , be cancelled by applying a non - linear task - space disturbance observer and hence , position regulation can be achieved in spite of such unwanted perturbations .",
    "@xmath37    or    @xmath38 \\label{eq:16}\\ ] ]    please note that the conversion from ( [ eq:15 ] ) to ( [ eq:16 ] ) might not be possible using standard weighted pseudo - inverse techniques as the rank of the matrix is equal to the degree of redundancy .",
    "however , it can be achieved using singular value decomposition techniques .",
    "a disturbance observer applied in the operational workspace or task - space is called a task - space disturbance observer@xcite .",
    "the model of a non - linear task - space disturbance observer is shown as the shaded region in fig.[fig:0 ] where @xmath15 is the reference force input , @xmath39 is the output , @xmath40 is the noise input , and @xmath34 is the disturbance force . @xmath41 is the actual model of the robot manipulator while @xmath42 is the non - linear nominal model .",
    "@xmath43 is the low - pass q - filter of the disturbance observer .",
    "@xmath44 is the command input while @xmath45 is the estimated disturbance from the disturbance observer .",
    "the non - linear disturbance observer estimates the disturbance force and nullifies its effect by adding it to the reference force input .",
    "the design of the low - pass filter is the most crucial element in the disturbance observer design .",
    "the sensitivity functions of the above disturbance observer are given by ( [ eq:17 ] ) which show that if the nominal model is very accurate such as @xmath46 , which is only possible if all the detailed non - linearities are modeled , then the low - pass filter is the only deciding factor of the performance of the disturbance observer .",
    "@xmath47    therefore , the selection of the order of the low - pass filter is very important .",
    "an optimal selection of the order is very important because , if the number of integrators @xmath48 is high , the disturbance rejection property gets enhanced for low frequencies while it results in more peaking of the sensitivity functions@xcite . hence , we have optimally selected a 3rd - order q - filter as given below considering all the above aspects @xcite .",

    "@xmath51    the above estimated force is then added to cancel the actual disturbance force effects in the task - space for the redundant robot manipulator . also , it is to be noted that the above disturbance observer is applied in a decentralized way for each of the three directions of the motion such as @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 axes .",

    "simulations are done using the real - time robotic simulation software _",
    "roboticslab v1.6.0 _ using the 7-dof redundant robot arm .",
    "the first set of simulations uses the simple mass - damper nominal model whose parameter values in the three axial directions are tuned appropriately and are given by @xmath67 kg and @xmath64 kg / s respectively in the x - direction , @xmath68 kg and @xmath69 kg / s respectively in the y and z directions .",
    "the cut - off frequency of the q - filter in the disturbance observer is taken as @xmath70 hz .",

    "theoretically , if the values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 are tuned properly , then external torques due to unwanted interactions with obstacles , should not affect the robot end - effector position regulation as per ( [ eq:16 ] ) .",

    ".    when the simulations are run , the robot manipulator is initially at rest in the absence of any torque / force input as the observer cancels the inertial , coriolis , and gravity effects .",
    "perturbations are then deliberately introduced in the simulation , which is run for around @xmath77s , by applying external forces to different links at different times .",
    "results have been plotted in figs.[fig:1 ] , [ fig:4 ] , [ fig:8 ] , [ fig:9 ] , and [ fig:10 ] . the choice of the first and fourth joints , to show the motion - profile , is arbitrary and any other choice would show similar results in all circumstances . the standard movement deviation of the robot end - effector for this case is noted to be @xmath78 m in the x - direction , @xmath79 m in the y - direction , and @xmath80 m in the z - direction .",
    "these results show that it is possible to isolate these unwanted perturbations and maintain the end - effector position of any redundant manipulator using this approach . however , position regulation is not so accurate as the motion of the end - effector is not negligible using this mass - damper lumped model .",
    "simulations , similar to the first set , were then conducted to analyze the effect of choosing a detailed non - linear dynamic nominal model of the robot manipulator in the output of the task - space disturbance observer for position regulation . for this set , the cut - off frequency of the q - filter , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 values are same as those of the earlier set .    the computation of the task - space inertia and coriolis matrices are done in accordance with ( [ eq:7 ] ) which requires the calculation of the derivative of the jacobian and also the joint - space inertia and coriolis matrices @xmath1 and @xmath7 respectively .",

    "figures [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:4 ] show the motion - profile of the first and the fourth joints of the redundant robot arm respectively for both the lumped model as well as the detailed non - linear model .",
    "it can be easily noticed that the motion profile of the first and fourth joints of the redundant robot arm for the detailed non - linear nominal model , as a result of the interactions with obstacles , is quite comparable to that of the simple mass - damper model .",
    "now , if we see figs.[fig:8 ] , [ fig:9 ] , and [ fig:10 ] , we can note that the end - effector motion , when the detailed non - linear model is used , is negligible compared to when the lumped model is used .",

    "firstly , the robot arm is allowed to move towards its target normally without any perturbation . in the second run , perturbations are introduced for the motion towards the same target .",

    "this further proves the efficacy of our proposed algorithm and shows its high significance in dexterous manipulation using multi - dof redundant robot arms .",
    "in this report , we have developed a novel method to regulate the position of redundant robot arms against arbitrary perturbations which might be present in 3d environments like unwanted interactions with obstacles in clumsy environments or uncertainties in the robotic system .",

    "the results show that this new method can successfully regulate the position of a robot arm in spite of arbitrary perturbations .",
    "these results are then compared with that of a conventional mass - damper based task - space disturbance observer which show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme .",
    "it is seen that due to the use of the non - linear model , there is a @xmath84 decrease in the robot end - effector movement in x - direction , @xmath85 decrease in y - direction , and @xmath86 decrease in the z - direction in spite of comparable perturbations to the robot arm .",
    "this method is then applied to a controller which exhibits human - like motion characteristics for reaching motion .",
    "results show that even if large arbitrary perturbations in the form of unwanted interactions with obstacles are introduced , the end - effector successfully continues to move in the human - like quasi - straight trajectory to reach the target even though the joint trajectories deviated by a considerably large amount .",
    "these results are then compared to the unperturbed motion of the same robot arm for the same reaching target which show that in spite of the large differences in the joint trajectories due to these unwanted interactions , the end - effector path remained the same ; and this proves the significance of this developed scheme .",
