    "thick disks in lenticular and spiral galaxies are defined as disk - like components with a scaleheight larger than that of the thin or ` canonical ' disk .",
    "they are typically detected as exponential excesses of light a few thin disk scaleheights above the galaxy mid - plane in edge - on galaxies .",
    "they have been first detected by tsikoudi ( 1979 ) and recognized as a distinct galaxy structural component by burstein ( 1979 ) .",
    "a thick disk component was soon found in the milky way ( gilmore & reid 1983 ) and it was afterwards proved to be made of old and metal - poor stars when compared to the thin disk stellar population ( reid & majewski 1993 ; chiba & beers 2000 ) . later studies found thick disks to be nearly ubiquitous ( yoachim & dalcanton 2006 ; comern et al .",
    "2011a ) and to be systematically older than their thin counterparts ( yoachim & dalcanton 2008a ) .",
    "the origin of thick disks is still a matter of debate , with four formation mechanisms being discussed ( see the introduction of yoachim & dalcanton 2008a and references therein ) .",
    "the first two possibilities consider two different mechanisms to dynamically heat an originally thin disk , meaning that its vertical stellar velocity dispersion is increased . in the first possibility",
    "this dynamical heating could be a consequence of internal evolution due to gravitational interaction with thin disk overdensities like giant molecular clouds or spiral arms ( villumsen 1985 ; hnninen & flynn 2002 ; schnrich & binney 2009 ; bournaud et al .",
    "2009 ) . in the second the heating",
    "is considered to be due to galaxy - galaxy or dark matter subhalo - galaxy interactions and mergers ( quinn et al .",
    "1993 ; robin et al .  1996 ; walker et al .",
    "1996 ; velzquez & white 1999 ; chen et al .  2001 ; benson et al .  2004 ;",
    "hayashi & chiba 2006 ; kazantzidis et al .  2008 ; read et al .",
    "2008 ; villalobos & helmi 2008 ; qu et al .",
    "the third possibility is that the thick disk is a consequence of _ in situ _ star formation ( brook et al .",
    "2004 ; robertson et al .  2006 ; elmegreen & elmegreen 2006 ; brook et al .  2007 ; richard et al .",
    "2010 ) or star formation with a high initial velocity dispersion in very massive star clusters ( kroupa 2002 ) .",
    "possibilities one and three are related if thick disk star formation occurs in gas that has a high turbulent velocity dispersion from its own clump stirring .",
    "the fourth possibility is that the thick disk is formed by accretion of stars from disrupted small satellite galaxies after the initial build - up of the galaxy ( statler 1988 ; gilmore et al .",
    "2002 ; abadi et al .  2003 ; navarro et al .  2004",
    "; martin et al .  2004 ; read et al .  2008 ) .",
    "another topic of debate is that of `` missing '' or `` lost '' baryons ( persic & salucci 1992 ) . the fraction of baryons detected at high redshift ( see , e.g. , wmap predictions by spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , does apparently not match the present - day fraction of baryons .",
    "part of the missing baryons are expected to be found in hot gas in the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ; see , e.g. , fukugita et al .",
    "1998 , simulations from cen & ostriker and whim emission detection / constraining by hickox & markevitch 2007 and zappacosta et al .",
    "additionally , dark matter haloes in which galaxies lie are also found to be very baryon deficient compared to the cosmic baryon fraction ( mcgaugh 2008 ) .",
    "this apparent lack of baryons inside the galaxy potential well is what has been called the `` local missing baryon '' problem .",
    "part of these baryons have probably escaped due to winds caused by supernova feedback , but the local baryon budget is far from being accounted for ( mcgaugh 2008 and references therein ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     if we ignore galaxies hosting an x - shaped bulge , our fraction of galaxies in which the thick disk contains more mass than the thin disk is 8 out of 23 ( @xmath3 ) for @xmath4 , and 15 out of 23 ( @xmath5 ) for @xmath6 .",
    "this remains in sharp contrast with the 20% found by yoachim & dalcanton ( 2006 ) .",
    "one possibility is that this difference is due to the choice of the fitting function .",
    "yoachim & dalcanton s ( 2006 ) results for each galaxy come from doing the median of the results of six fits with different mid - plane maskings , different smoothings to account for the seeing and different combinations of @xmath7 and @xmath8 accounting for the thin and the thick disk . of these six fitting models , three make use of a sum of two @xmath8 functions and are thus likely to dominate the median of the six models .",
    "we tested whether fitting the sum of two @xmath8 functions gives more weight to the thin disk than the functions we used .",
    "we produced @xmath8 fits over our luminosity profiles using the same procedure than when fitting the equilibrium solutions , except for the fact that , for simplicity , we have not used a psf convolution and we have not taken into account the effect of dust extinction which we show to be very small in most cases ( see table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "we found that the shape of the thick disk close to the mid - plane appears rounded in the case of a @xmath8 fit , but it is significantly more peaked when making a fit using the equations of equilibrium ( see figure  [ comparison ] for an example ) .    from a linear regression crossing the origin ( figure  [ sech2 ] )",
    ", we found that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the fits using two @xmath8 functions , and @xmath11 stands for the fits using the equations of equilibrium .",
    "this implies that , if we assume our approach to be accurate , and yoachim & dalcanton ( 2006 ) mass measurements to be dominated by the models with a sum of two @xmath8 functions , they might have underestimated @xmath12 by a factor of @xmath13 .",
    "when multiplying by 1.7 the @xmath12 values in fig .",
    "22 of yoachim & dalcanton ( 2006 ) , we find that 12 out 34 galaxies ( @xmath3 ) would have @xmath14 , a value close to that we obtain with @xmath4 .",
    "the gradient in @xmath15 with @xmath16 discussed in section  3.3.4 is likely to have some effect in the trend seen in figure  [ vmax ] .",
    "as @xmath15 is larger for galaxies with a small @xmath16 , it would cause the trend to be strengthened .    for further comparison with the results of yoachim & dalcanton ( 2006 )",
    "we should decompose galaxies from their sample with our methodology using s@xmath2 g imaging .",
    "there is a four galaxy overlap between the s@xmath2 g and their sample but , unfortunately , at the time of the sample selection of this paper ( december 2010 ) those galaxies have not gone through the automated mosaicking / cleaning process yet .",
    "we plan to study this overlap in detail in a follow - up paper .    in summary , we find that our thick to thin disk mass ratios ( @xmath12 ) are higher than those found in literature due to the large fraction of mass attributed to the thick disk at low @xmath17 when fitting luminosity profiles with the equations of coupled isothermal disks in equilibrium .",
    "these results have been obtained from data which can reproduce yoachim & dalcanton s ( 2006 ) results when fitting a sum of two @xmath8 functions . as our model",
    "is based in physically motivated functions and we are using images less affected by dust than in previous studies , our results are likely to be the most accurate so far for such a large sample .",
    "we will now explore the implications of our results , in particular higher thick disk masses .",
    "the main result of this paper is that the total stellar mass of thick disks is similar to that of thin disks and that in some cases , the thick disk mass can be up to 2  3 times larger than that in the thin disk . these surprisingly massive thick disks , together with the fact that we have found no significant flares , put some constraints on their formation mechanisms .",
    "the first formation mechanism to be discussed is that of a dynamical heating of an originally thin disk by disk overdensities .",
    "secular heating due to giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) has sometimes been suggested as a reason of disk heating .",
    "however , this mechanism has been recognized as insufficient to explain the highest velocity dispersion stars ( villumsen 1985 ; even a fourfold increase in the number of gmcs would not be enough to explain the presence of the hottest populations of stars according , to hnninen & flynn 2002 ) .",
    "this mechanism is thus not likely to create very massive thick disks .",
    "alternatively , the disk may have been mostly heated in a short interval of time at the beginning of the history of the galaxy , an epoch in which there is a large population of clumpy disks whose clumps formed through disk gravitational instabilities and had a mass of a few @xmath18 ( elmegreen & elmegreen 2005 ) .",
    "these massive clumps have a stellar scattering power much larger than present - day gmcs .",
    "bournaud et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found that this mechanism plus further secular evolution could cause a thick to thin disk mass ratio @xmath19 in simulations designed to produce galaxies with milky way mass .",
    "thus , bournaud s et al .  (",
    "2009 ) milky way - like simulated galaxies , although a little bit short in thick disk mass , would be compatible with the @xmath20 relationship for @xmath4 . however , as these simulations have only been run for milky way - like galaxies , the effect caused in a less massive galaxy in unknown .",
    "thick disks created through star scattering and radial mixing by spiral arms has been discussed and modeled by schnrich & binney ( 2009 ) who also succeed to reproduce a reasonable thick disk ( although again light when put in the @xmath20 relationship due to the fact that they fitted the milky way which we have shown to have often been measured to be very thin disk - dominated ) .",
    "another possibility is that the thick disk has been created by the heating of a thin disk by satellite galaxies or dark matter subhaloes .",
    "this mechanism is more efficient for galaxies with orbits far from coplanar with the disk ( read et al .",
    "according to simulations , these interactions may heat the disk to form a thick disk , but they are thought to also cause a significant flare whose exact properties are dependent on the encounter parameters ( quinn et al .  1993 ; walker et al .",
    "1996 ; kazantzidis et al .  2008 ;",
    "villalobos & helmi 2008 ; bournaud et al .  2009 ) .",
    "most of these authors suggest the flare to be at galactocentric radii small enough to be detectable in some cases .",
    "the exception is the work by villalobos & helmi ( 2008 ) , where the flare would only affect the thick disk at very large galactocentric radii , which would need deeper photometry than ours to be detected .",
    "kazantzidis et al .  (",
    "2008 ) suggested that the flares in edge - on galaxies are what we interpret as truncations , as flares would be so substantial that the stars would be scattered over a large vertical range , causing the disk in those regions to have a very low surface brightness when seen edge - on .",
    "this would also imply that truncations are more often detected in edge - on galaxies , which is likely to be the case ( see discussion in pohlen et al .",
    "we have found that strong flares are not common among our galaxies , implying that thick disks are unlikely to form through the heating of a disk by satellites .",
    "even if the flares were so strong to appear as truncations , the heating through encounters would fail to explain the existence of thick disks in some galaxies , since thick disks are ubiquitous and truncations , although very common , do not appear in all galaxies ( kregel et al .",
    "2002 ; van der kruit 2007 ) .",
    "minor mergers indeed occur in disk galaxies , but they are likely to have a small effect at high redshift , where they are more frequent , due to the presence of a high gas fraction in the disk ( moster et al .  2010 ; previous simulations usually do not consider gas effects ) .",
    "the effect of gas for avoiding heating by interactions with satellite galaxies is still significant for galaxies with a gas fraction similar to that of present - day milky way , although it allows part of the thin disk to be heated into a flared thick disk ( qu et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "some authors theorize that a thick disk may be a consequence of an _ in situ _ star formation . according to the simulations of brook et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the thick disk star formation is triggered by the accretion of gas - rich protogalactic fragments during hierarchical clustering at high redshift .",
    "the gas disk would still be dynamically hot at the moment of the thick disk creation , which would explain the difference in scaleheight between the thick disk which formed early and the thin disk formed from a cooled gas disk and from additional gas coming from cold flows .",
    "brook et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that thick disk scalelengths are larger than those of thin disks , which is in contradiction with observations ( yoachim & dalcanton 2006 ) .",
    "later models using disk - disk gas - rich mergers ( robertson et al .  2006 ; brook et al .  2007 ; richard et al .",
    "2010 ) are able to produce reasonable thick disks from stars from the progenitor galaxies plus stars created during the merger , with the stars which are created later settling in a thin disk .",
    "however , these simulations do not include posterior accretion of cold gas , which will settle in the thin disk , increase its mass , and reduce the scaleheight of the thick disk .",
    "another _ in situ _ formation model is that from elmegreen & elmegreen ( 2006 ) , who study chain and spiral galaxies in the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "ultra deep field ( udf ) and find that the scaleheight of those galaxies is similar to that of present - day thick disks , with a mass column density of 4 to 40 @xmath21 .",
    "recent studies ( e.g. , moni bidin et al .  2010 ) found the milky way column mass density in the solar neighborhood to be @xmath22 , thus , if we assume udf thick disks to be progenitors of present - day thick disks , thick - to - thin disk column mass density fractions up to @xmath23 would be compatible with the udf thick disk mass estimates for milky way - like galaxies .",
    "however , interpreting these galaxies as direct progenitors of thick disks for which a thin disk has been added after accreting gas through cold flows is problematic , as discussed in elmegreen & elmegreen ( 2006 ) as the udf thick disks are likely to shrink to lower scaleheights when further material is accreted , making them much thinner than observed present - day thick disks .",
    "elmegreen & elmegreen ( 2006 ) calculated that in order to create a milky way - like thick disk with @xmath24pc , the equivalent udf thick disk should have @xmath25kpc , which is far larger than the observed average udf thick disk .",
    "however , as we found that thick disks are much more massive than previously thought , the fraction of added gas needed to generate a thin disk is lower than that estimated by elmegreen & elmegreen ( 2006 ) , making the decrease in @xmath26 of the udf thick disks lower than what they estimated .    in a @xmath27cdm scenario ,",
    "at least a fraction of the thick disk stars is expected to be accreted from satellite galaxies dragged into the disk plane by dynamical friction .",
    "this process would be effective for galaxies with an impact angle @xmath28 , and larger angle encounters produce spherical - like distributions as well as a thick disk by thin disk heating , as discussed before ( read et al .",
    "2008 ; but again these simulations do not include gas and thus the effect of disk heating may be overestimated ) . however , according to these authors , this mechanism applied to the milky way would produce a disk @xmath29  10 times less massive than observed , and thus needs to be combined with other thick disk formation mechanisms .",
    "scannapieco et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found that their simulated thick disks , which have been defined to be made of stars older than 9gyr , have `` relatively high fractions '' of non - accreted stars although the exact value is not specified . a strong indication that this mechanism is likely to be at the origin of a significant fraction of material in at least some galaxies is the discovery of a thick disk with a significant fraction of counterrotating material by yoachim & dalcanton ( 2008b ) .",
    "we now summarize our comments on the various proposed thick disk formations scenarios :    * heating of a thin disk by its own overdensities , in the form of , e.g. , spiral arms , gmcs or giant clusters : this mechanism may have difficulties to produce massive enough thick disks .",
    "* heating of a thin disk by satellite galaxies or dark matter subhaloes crossing it : not likely to cause a significant effect as it would cause noticeable flares .",
    "its effect is highly reduced when the disk contains a significant fraction of gas . * _ in situ _ thick disk formation : this formation mechanism had the problem of the shrinking of the thick disk scaleheight due to the accretion of external material after the thick disk formation , which would make thick disks indistinguishable from their thin counterparts .",
    "however , our results indicate that thick disks of many galaxies are much more massive than previously thought , lessening the impact of the newer material in the thick disk scaleheight .",
    "* accretion of stars of satellite galaxies ( tidal stripping ) : this mechanism occurs necessarily for some galaxies , as indicated by their kinematical or morphological signatures .",
    "however , simulations have shown that this effect can not explain all the mass found in thick disks .",
    "thus , our results plus data from previous studies tend to favor an _ in situ _",
    "origin for most of the stars in the thick disk , where the thin disk created afterwards is not massive enough to reduce @xmath26 by too much .",
    "in addition the thick disk may contain a significant amount of stars coming from satellites accreted after the initial build - up of the galaxy and an extra fraction of stars coming from the secular heating of the thin disk .",
    "thick disk - dominated galaxies may play some role in what has been called the `` missing baryon problem '' ( persic & salucci 1992 ) .",
    "wmap cosmic microwave background observations have constrained the fraction of baryons in the universe ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , but most of this baryonic matter is apparently not found in the `` obvious '' reservoirs which are stars and cold gas in galaxies ( bell et al .",
    "2003 ) . at a galactic scale ,",
    "several studies indicate that observations are missing a large fraction of the baryons relative to the dark matter content in the milky way halo , and this problem appears to be even more severe for galaxies with smaller masses ( hoekstra et al .",
    "2005 ; mcgaugh 2007 ; mcgaugh 2008 ; bregman 2009 ) .",
    "rough counts by mcgaugh ( 2008 ) for the milky way show that we are missing at least @xmath30 , which is comparable or larger than the mass of all the baryonic mass thought to be contained in the disk .",
    "two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the `` missing baryons '' in galaxy dark matter haloes .",
    "the first is that there is a quantity hot gas in the halo which has either failed to cool down , or was blown away by supernova feedback .",
    "this hot gas in the halo has been measured to have a mass of @xmath31 ( bregman & lloyd - davies 2007 ) , which falls way short of solving the `` local missing baryon '' problem .",
    "the second possibility is that supernova feedback has blown away halo gas so efficiently that this material has been lost into the intergalactic medium .",
    "the amount of baryons lost in this way is difficult to estimate but it is also apparently not enough to explain the low fraction of baryons in galaxies ( mcgaugh 2010 ) . even though they remain insufficient , both explanations have the merit of explaining satisfactorily why lower - mass galaxies have lower baryon fractions , as supernova feedback is more effective in shallower potential wells .    for external galaxies ,",
    "the stellar masses inside the disks are calculated by assuming a given mass - to - light ratio . however , ignoring the presence of an unexpectedly high fraction of stars in the thick disk may have led to an underestimate of the value of @xmath32 .",
    "some numbers may be easily obtained from the data plotted in figure  [ vmax ] .",
    "let us consider the more thin disk - dominated galaxies ( @xmath33 ) for the case @xmath4 .",
    "if we were ignoring a thick disk , and assign a thin disk @xmath32 for all the light emitted by the galaxy , we would be underestimating the stellar mass of the galaxy by @xmath34 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider the most thick disk - dominated galaxy ( @xmath35 ) , and @xmath6 , we would underestimate the stellar disk mass by a factor of two .",
    "these numbers are calculated for the 3.6@xmath36m - band , which implies that the underestimation of the disk stellar mass would be different when measured at shorter wavelengths .",
    "we stress that these numbers only account for the baryons in stellar disks , and that if extended gas disks beyond the optical radius were included in the thin disk mass as done by yoachim & dalcanton ( 2006 ) @xmath12 would go down .",
    "thus , our results suggest that a least a fraction of the `` local missing baryons '' are located in the thick disk component of galaxies and that they have been `` lost '' until now due to the underestimation of @xmath12 .",
    "this explanation is complementary , and not an alternative , to those which have already been suggested to solve the problem .",
    "the nature of the mechanisms creating the thick disks has been a topic of discussion for a long time .",
    "basically four pictures have been suggested , each leaving some distinct observational signature .",
    "the first one is that the thick disk is the consequence of the thin disk have been dynamically heated by its own overdensities .",
    "the second possibility is that thin disks being dynamically heated by the disk crossing of satellite galaxies or dark matter subhaloes .",
    "the third possibility is _ in situ _ star formation during or shortly after the build - up of the galaxy .",
    "the fourth is that the thick disk could be made of stars which have been accreted from infalling satellites after the formation of the thin disk .    in order to study the problem of thick disk formation we have used 3.6@xmath36 m images of edge - on galaxies from the s@xmath2 g .",
    "the selection criterion used , maximum isophote ellipticity @xmath37 , has led to a sample of 46 late - type galaxies with types ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "we have fitted the luminosity profiles of these galaxies in radial bins with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , using solutions of the equations of equilibrium for two stellar and one gaseous coupled isothermal disks .",
    "these functions have the advantage of being physically motivated .",
    "the largest uncertainty of the fit comes from the assumed ratio of mass - to - light ratios of the thick and the thin disk , @xmath15 .",
    "we studied cases with @xmath4 and @xmath6 in order to account for the range of fitted star formation histories for the solar neighborhood .",
    "the low value of @xmath15 arises when the stars in thick disks form over a long period of time and the high value arises when the thick disk stars formed entirely in a burst in the early universe .",
    "the studied interval in @xmath15 is in broad agreement with that derived from the study by yoachim & dalcanton ( 2006 ) .",
    "we found that the stellar mass of the thick disk component ranges from one third to two times that of the thin disk if @xmath4 and from two thirds to more than three times if @xmath6 .",
    "we thus found that thick disks are much more massive than generally assumed so far . in order to check the reasons of this difference",
    ", we compared our results in detail with those from yoachim & dalcanton ( 2006 ) .",
    "we found that the choice of the fitting function is responsible for the high fraction of stellar light we detect in the thick disk .",
    "we also found that disks do not flare significantly within the range of galactocentric radii we have studied , and that the ratio of thick to thin disk scaleheights is higher for earlier - type galaxies in our sample .",
    "the lack of flares discards the kinematical heating of a thin disk by satellite galaxies or dark matter subhaloes as the main thick disk formation mechanism .    as a result of these findings",
    "we suggest the following tentative formation mechanism for thick disks .",
    "first , a thick stellar disk is created during and soon after the build - up of the galaxy by the stirring action from massive disk clumps and the instabilities that form those clumps . a thin disk subsequently forms from gas which has not initially been spent in stars , and from gas that arrives later at a lower rate so that , when combined with the hot disk and bulge that are already present , it is relatively stable and can not heat itself much .",
    "the newly accreted gas makes the thick disk scaleheight , @xmath26 , shrink , and if this shrinkage is a relatively small amount , then the final thick disk remains a distinct component of the galaxy , with a younger thin disk inside of it . in the case of thick - disk dominated galaxies , the thick disk forms partly at high redshift by internal disk stirring , as above , and then increases its mass over a hubble time by the heating of the thin disk by internal disk substructure , such as large star clusters and giant molecular clouds , and the accretion of satellite galaxies .    as our results suggest that thick disks have masses comparable to those of thin disks and in addition they have a large mass - to - light ratio due to the absence of young stars",
    ", we suggest that ignoring them has led to an underestimate of the baryonic mass located in disk galaxies .",
    "we thus suggest that thick disks contain part of what has been called the `` local missing baryons '' .",
    "we have calculated this underestimate to be between 10% and 50% of the stellar mass of a disk , depending on the ratio of the thick versus thin disk masses and mass - to - light ratios , @xmath12 and @xmath15 .",

    "<S> we present the results of a study of the thick disk properties in a sample of carefully selected edge - on galaxies with types ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we fitted one - dimensional luminosity profiles with physically motivated functions  the solutions of two stellar and one gaseous isothermal coupled disks in equilibrium  which are likely to yield more accurate results than other functions used in previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> the images used for the fits come from the spitzer survey of stellar structure in galaxies ( s@xmath2 g ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that thick disks are on average more massive than previously reported , mostly due to the selected fitting function . </S>",
    "<S> typically , the thin and the thick disk have similar masses . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that thick disks do not flare significantly within the observed range in galactocentric radii and that the ratio of thick to thin disk scaleheights is higher for galaxies of earlier types .    </S>",

    "<S> origin for most of the stars in the thick disk . </S>",
    "<S> in addition the thick disk may contain a significant amount of stars coming from satellites accreted after the initial build - up of the galaxy and an extra fraction of stars coming from the secular heating of the thin disk by its own overdensities .    </S>",
    "<S> assigning thick disk light to the thin disk component may lead to an underestimate of the overall stellar mass in galaxies , because of different mass to light ratios in the two disk components . on the basis of our new results </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate that disk stellar masses are between 10% and 50% higher than previously thought and we suggest that thick disks are a reservoir of `` local missing baryons '' . </S>"
