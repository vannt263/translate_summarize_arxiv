    "the luminosity of colliding storage rings is one of the most important criteria of performance . in order to achieve high luminosity",
    ", the colliding beams need to be aligned precisely at the collision point in all three dimensions . for a symmetric collider ,",
    "the alignment of the electron and positron beams is ensured automatically by the symmetries of charge conjugation and time - reversal . since",
    "an asymmetric collider consists of two different storage rings , precise alignment of the two beams at the collision can only be achieved through tuning of the two rings .    in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to show some effects on the luminosity when the two beams are not aligned well in transverse planes due to the coupling .",
    "it was shown by edwards and teng@xcite that a two - dimensional coupled linear motion in a periodic and symplectic system can be parameterized with ten independent parameters as a block diagonalization of a one - turn matrix @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the rotation matrix and @xmath2 defines the symplectic transformation from the normalized coordinates to the physical coordinates .",
    "these matrices can be further decomposed into @xmath3 and @xmath4 where @xmath5 is 2@xmath62 identity matrix and @xmath7 are 2@xmath62 symplectic matrices with a determinant of unity .",
    "the angle @xmath8 is called coupling angle . here",
    "we denote the bar as two - dimensional symplectic conjugate @xmath9 where @xmath10 is 2@xmath62 unit symplectic matrix @xmath11    recently , it is pointed out by sagan and rubin@xcite that there exists another solution of parameterization @xmath12 where @xmath13 .    in the case of a strongly coupled lattice , for example , the interaction region of the low energy ring(ler ) of pep - ii , both solutions are needed for a complete parameterization of the region .        here",
    "we choose @xmath8 as a parameter of linear coupling because it has two very important properties : system is decoupled when @xmath14 and @xmath8 can be changed only by a skew quadrupole or solenoid as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coupling ] from which the locations of the skew quadrupoles and solenoid are clearly seen .",
    "in the normalized coordinate , the sigma matrix can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the equilibrium emittances in the eigen planes ignoring the off - diagonal terms at the order of the damping increment per turn .",
    "the sigma matrix in the physical coordinate is obtained with the transformation @xmath18 the corresponding equilibrium gaussian distribution is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the vector of canonical coordinates . the beam profile in the configuration @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "is derived by integrating the canonical momentum @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xmath25        the result of the integration is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the vector of configuration coordinates namely @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the inverse of the sigma matrix @xmath30 moreover , the symmetric matrix @xmath29 can be diagonalized by a rotation transformation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rot ] @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the tilted angle of the beam .",
    "the parameters that describe the beam in two coordinate systems relate with each other as following @xmath33 and @xmath34        \\nonumber \\\\ { 1\\over\\sigma_\\eta^2 } & = & { 1\\over2 } [ ( k_{xx } + k_{yy } ) - { k_{xx}-k_{yy }                       \\over\\cos2\\psi}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 are the elements of @xmath29 and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the beam size along the long axis @xmath38 and short axis @xmath39 of the ellipse respectively .",
    "for simplicity , we ignore the effect of a finite bunch length . given the two beam profiles , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the luminosity can be written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number of the colliding bunches , @xmath44 is the revolution frequency , and @xmath45 are the number of charges in each position and electron bunch respectively .    at a low beam current ,",
    "the beam distribution is nearly gaussian . using gaussian as an approximation",
    ", we can evaluate the overlapping integral @xmath46 in order to analyze the result of the calculation , we rewrite the integral in terms of the geometrical parameters , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath32 by substituting eq .  [ eqn : geom ] into eq .",
    "[ eqn : dets ] @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 clearly , the luminosity is at its maximum when @xmath50 which is always the case in a symmetric collider due the symmetries .",
    "when two flat beams have identical size , we have @xmath51 it is easy to see that the reduction of the luminosity due to the difference of the two tilted angles are much enhanced by the aspect ratio @xmath36/@xmath37 of the beams .",
    "the luminosity depends upon all six geometrical parameters @xmath52 , and @xmath53 which describe the size and orientation of the beams .",
    "it is impossible to extract these parameters directly from the luminosity alone . by transversely scanning the beam crossing the other one",
    ", we could extract more constraints among them .",
    "let s calculate the overlapping integral with an offset of centroid of a beam @xmath54 after a lengthy but straightforward algebra , we obtain @xmath55 the result agrees with eq .  [",
    "eqn : lumi ] when @xmath56 .",

    ", we move one beam against the other one horizontally with a closed orbit bump at the collision point and measure the luminosity as a function of the offset .",
    "the luminosity of the scan is proportional to @xmath65 where @xmath66 to simplify the calculation , let s assume that @xmath67 which is a very good approximation when the luminosity is well optimized . for flat beams and small @xmath32 s , we have @xmath68.\\ ] ] we can see that @xmath32 makes @xmath69 smaller than the design value and the effect of @xmath32 is much enhanced by the aspect ratio .",
    "similarly , we carry out the calculation for the vertical scan @xmath70 where @xmath32 makes @xmath71 slightly larger but is not enhanced by the aspect ratio as in the horizontal scan .",
    "more general , we can scan the luminosity as a function of both horizontal and vertical offsets in a two - dimensional grid .",
    "the result of the measurement is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scan ] as contour plots of the specific luminosity .",
    "the results of the fitting are @xmath72 @xmath73 m , @xmath74 @xmath73 m , and @xmath75 compared with the design values : @xmath76 @xmath73 m , @xmath77 @xmath73 m , and @xmath78 .",
    "we have calculated the degradation of luminosity due to different tilted angles of colliding beams . for same tilted angles ,",
    "the higher the aspect ratio is the more luminosity reduction will be .",
    "furthermore , we have computed a general luminosity formula for off - centered beams .",
    "the formula is used to understand the luminosity scan , especially for the two - dimensional scan .",
    "we would like to thank w. kozanecki , m. minty , j. seeman , and u. wienands for many helpful discussions ."
