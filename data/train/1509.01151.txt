    "note that our proof for the global @xmath33-bound for @xmath17 presented in section 6 is based on @xmath72-estimates for @xmath73 and shows that @xmath74 is even decaying exponentially as @xmath75 .",
    "cao and titi followed in their celebrated article @xcite a different strategy : they showed that the local solution constructed there by different means satisfies a global @xmath7-bound .",
    "their proof of the @xmath7-bound was based on @xmath36-estimates for the fluctuating part @xmath76 , where @xmath77 denotes the vertical average of @xmath17 ( see below ) .",
    "finally , let us compare our choice of the boundary conditions with the ones treated in the preceding articles described above .",
    "the first condition @xmath78 on @xmath79 is a slip boundary condition ( note , however , that this condition differs from the usual slip boundary condition based on the deformation tensor ) .",

    "this setting is adopted in the analysis of @xcite and in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.6 ) .    from the physical point of view",
    "it is natural to impose a no - slip condition of the form @xmath85 on the the bottom boundary @xmath86 ; see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.1 ) . in this case , the commutator relation described above does not longer hold true .",
    "kukavica and ziane @xcite supposed that @xmath80 is a smooth domain and that @xmath83 is subject to the no - slip condition .",

    "our approach for obtaining global @xmath33-bounds for these or related boundary conditions is based on @xmath72-estimates for @xmath73 and @xmath88-estimates for @xmath89 .",
    "adding the estimates for @xmath73 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 allows us then to apply a classical gronwall argument , hereby avoiding delicate arguments needed for integrating the associated differential inequalities .",
    "as already mentioned above , our approach yields a smoothing effect for the solution @xmath17 in the @xmath0-setting .",
    "in fact , we show that @xmath92 for @xmath66 and that @xmath17 even decays exponentially as @xmath93 .",
    "following lions , temam and wang @xcite and cao and titi @xcite , we start this section by rewriting the primitive equations given in subject to the boundary conditions in an equivalent manner . to this end , let us note that the vertical component @xmath18 of @xmath14 is determined by the incompressibility condition . more precisely , @xmath94 where we have taken into account the boundary condition @xmath95 on @xmath79 .",
    "the further boundary condition @xmath95 on @xmath86 gives rise to the constraint @xmath96 where @xmath77 stands for the average of @xmath17 in the vertical direction , i.e. , @xmath97 we observe that the averaging operator commutes with the tangential differentiation , i.e. we have @xmath98 for all smooth functions @xmath22 .",
