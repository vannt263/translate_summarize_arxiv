    "a classical way to measure the topological complexity of a dynamical system is its _ entropy_. in particular , to each real polynomial map @xmath2 one can associate the topological entropy of @xmath2 as a dynamical system on the real line @xcite .    if @xmath3 is a complex polynomial map , then the real line is no longer invariant , and it becomes less obvious to define a notion of entropy for @xmath2 .",

    "rational primitive majors are associated to polynomials : essentially , one records the major leaf for each critical point .",
    "thus , we can assign to each primitive major @xmath9 the _ core entropy",

    "we prove that the core entropy extends to a continuous function on the combinatorial parameter space :    [ theorem : main ] the core entropy function @xmath10 extends to a continuous function on the set pm@xmath6 of primitive majors of degree @xmath1 .",
    "the previous result is purely combinatorial , as the core entropy can be computed from the combinatorial data of the rational primitive major @xmath9 . in the second part of the paper",

    "while it is conjectured that the mandelbrot set is locally connected @xcite , it is known that the connectedness locus for cubics is not locally connected ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "then the core entropy @xmath15 is a continuous function on the space of polynomials of degree @xmath1 .",
    "the study of topological entropy for real , quadratic polynomials goes back to the seminal work of milnor - thurston @xcite , who proved that it depends continuously and monotonically on the parameter .",
    "alternative proofs are also given in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "two types of generalization of these results are possible : on one hand , for complex quadratic polynomials generalizations of the real line are _ veins _ in the mandelbrot set @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , it is known that the core entropy in monotone , increasing from the center of the mandelbrot set to the tips ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the core entropy function is intimately related to the topological structure of the mandelbrot set : in fact , sublevels of the entropy function can be used to define wakes in @xmath16 .    on the other hand ,",
    "a considerable amount of work has gone into understanding entropy for real polynomials of higher degree . in particular",
    ", it was conjectured by milnor that the entropy for real polynomials of a given degree @xmath1 is also monotone , in the sense that isentropic curves in parameter space are connected .",
    "this was proven by milnor - tresser for cubics @xcite and by bruin - van strien for general degrees @xcite .",
    "the present paper is one of the first attempts to study the core entropy for higher - degree polynomials which are not real .",
    "note that some of the techniques used in the quadratic case do not generalize , as we can not use the vein structure of the mandelbrot set .",
    "in fact , our proof of continuity does not rely at all on the understanding of the topology of the connectedness locus : on the other hand , we believe the core entropy may be a useful tool to define and investigate the hierarchical structure of the connectedness locus , which is much less understood than in the quadratic case .",
    "finally , the core entropy is related by the simple formula ( see @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath17 to the dimension of the set @xmath18 of biaccessible angles , which has been studied extensively , e.g. in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our approach to core entropy generalizes the one in @xcite , and uses an algorithm devised by thurston in order to compute the core entropy without the need to understand the topology of the hubbard tree .",

    "we then associate to this infinite graph its _ growth rate _ @xmath21 by considering the growth of the number of closed paths in the graph : @xmath22 and prove that such number is the zero of a convergent power series @xmath23 , which we call _ spectral determinant_. 3 .",
    "we prove that the growth rate @xmath21 depends continuously on the space of critical portraits .",
    "4 .   for rational critical portraits @xmath19 , we prove that the growth rate is related to the core entropy @xmath24 given by thurston s algorithm ( lemma [ lem : entropy - continuity ] ) , namely @xmath25    this establishes theorem [ theorem : main ] and concludes the combinatorial part of the paper .    to get the second main result ( theorem [ theorem : main2 ] ) ,",

    "critical marking_. let us pick for each @xmath14 a critical marking , which we denote as @xmath27 .",
    "2 .   we then study the possible limits of the sequence @xmath28 : it turns out that limits of critical markings for @xmath14 need not be critical markings for @xmath2 , since more rays than expected can land on the same critical point ( see example [ e : not - conv ] ) . for this reason",
    ", we introduce the more general notion of _ weak critical marking _ , and prove that ( proposition [ julia - type - converge ] ) : @xmath29 this is the analytic part of the paper , as it requires controlling the convergence of landing rays as parameters change .",
    "in fact , the parts of the marking associated to fatou critical points and to julia critical points need to be dealt with separately .",
    "3 .   we use @xcite to conclude that thurston s algorithm also gives the correct value of core entropy for weak critical markings , hence @xmath30 and also @xmath31 .",
    "by the first combinatorial part , @xmath32 , hence @xmath33 which completes the proof of theorem [ theorem : main2 ] .      before delving into the proofs",
    ", we explore the structure and topology of the set pm@xmath6 of primitive majors in degree @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "see @xcite for the general case .",
    "a _ critical portrait _ of degree @xmath1 is defined as a collection @xmath36 of leaves and ideal polygons in @xmath37 fullfilling the following conditions :    1 .",
    "any two distinct elements @xmath38 and @xmath39 either are disjoint or intersect at one point on @xmath40 ; 2 .",
    "the vertices of each @xmath38 are identified under @xmath41 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath42 .",
    "a critical portrait @xmath9 is said to be a _ primitive major _ if point ( 1 ) in the definition above is strengthened to be that the elements of @xmath9 are pairwise disjoint .    for @xmath43 ,",
    "a primitive major is simply a diameter of the circle .",
    "thus , each primitive major is parameterized by an angle @xmath44 , and the parameter space pm@xmath45 is homeomorphic to a circle .    for @xmath46",
    ", a cubic polynomial has either one critical point of multiplicity @xmath34 , or two critical points of multiplicity @xmath47 .",
    "hence , there are two types of primitive majors : either an ideal triangle , or two leaves . for each pair",
    "@xmath48 one can associate the pair of leaves @xmath49 , and since the leaves can not cross each other , one gets the strip @xmath50 which is the parameter space displayed in figure [ f : global ] .",
    "there are two particularly important slices :    1 .",
    "the _ unicritical _ slice @xmath51 .",
    "it corresponds to the family @xmath52 : each polynomial has only one critical point .",
    "combinatorially , it is represented by the slice @xmath53 and the primitive majors are of the form @xmath54 .",
    "see figure [ f : uni ] for a graph of the restriction of the core entropy to this slice .",
    "the _ symmetric _ slice @xmath55 .",
    "it corresponds to the family @xmath56 , and each polynomial is an odd function .",
    "combinatorially , it is represented by @xmath57 , so the associated primitive majors are @xmath58 .",
    "see figure [ f : sym ] .    in order to account for the symmetries , note that @xmath59 and @xmath60 are interchangeable",
    ", so one can restrict to @xmath61 getting the annulus @xmath62 the annulus @xmath63 has two boundary components , corresponding to the two slices @xmath51 and @xmath55 .",
    "one sees by the above discussion that the slice @xmath51 is periodic of period @xmath35 , because the pairs @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 yield the same primitive major . moreover , the pairs @xmath67 and @xmath68 also yield the same primitive major , hence the slice @xmath55 is periodic of period @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the parameter space pm@xmath70 is homeomorphic to the quotient of the annulus where one of the boundary components wraps around @xmath34 times , and the other boundary circle wraps around @xmath35 times . in formulas : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the resulting space is not quite a manifold , as a neighbourhood of the unicritical locus @xmath51 contains three  sheets \" which come together .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that @xmath74 has a natural stratification based on the size of the components of the primitive major .",
    "namely , let @xmath75 be integers with @xmath76",
    ". then one can define the stratum @xmath77 as the set of primitive majors in @xmath74 which have leaves of size @xmath75 . in the above discussion of the cubic locus , the unicritical locus is the stratum @xmath78 , while the generic stratum is @xmath79 .",
    "a natural question then becomes :    * question .",
    "* what is the maximum of core entropy on each stratum ?",
    "how many ( and which ) polynomials achieve the maximum ?    in general , the global maximum on @xmath80 equals @xmath81 , while as an example in the unicritical locus @xmath78 the maximum is @xmath82 .",
    "we start in section 2 by reviewing the techniques in graph theory needed to define the core entropy through the _",
    "spectral determinant_. in section 3 , we define the combinatorial parameter space using primitive majors , and recall thurston s entropy algorithm to compute the entropy .",
    "then ( section 4 ) we define the infinite graphs , called _ wedges _ , which we use to encode the combinatorial dynamics in the space of poscritical arcs . in order to study the limits of wedges",
    "as parameters vary , we define in section 5 the concept of _ weakly periodic _ labeled wedge . in section 7 , we prove that any limit of sequence of wedges which correspond to a sequence of convergent parameters actually yields the same entropy .",
    "finally , in section 8 we use this to establish the first main result , namely the continuity in the combinatorial parameter space ( theorem [ theorem : main ] ) .    in the second part of the paper ( section 9 ) we transfer this combinatorial information to the analytic parameter space",
    ": there , we establish that as the coefficients of the polynomials converge , then the critical markings also converge in a suitable way .",
    "this is achieved by showing continuity properties of the landing points of certain rays , and introducing a generalization of the concept of critical marking ( which we call _ weak critical marking _ ) which captures the marking of a limit of postcritically finite polynomials . using these tools we prove the second main result ( theorem [ theorem : main2 ] ) .",
