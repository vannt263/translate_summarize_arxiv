    "there is theoretical evidence that compact stars , such as neutron stars , are made up of several matter phases @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the astonishingly high density excursion they could attain in their inner regions . for instance , a neutron star is in general thought as composed by at least to different regions : the crust and the core .",
    "starting from very low densities of a few grams per cubic centimeter close to their surfaces , and up to densities of the order of the nuclear saturation value , @xmath0  g  @xmath1 , the crust of a neutron star is thought to be in a _ solid - like _ state .",
    "the core , with densities that might overcome by orders of magnitude @xmath2 , is instead thought to be in a _ liquid - like _ state .",
    "the details of the treatment of the thermodynamic transition ( e.g.  maxwell or gibbs phase construction ) , as well as the conditions on density and pressure at which such a transition occurs , are still a matter of debate .",
    "the application of the gibbs construction with more than one conserved charge ( e.g.  baryon and electric ) leads to the appearance of mixed phases , in between of the pure phases , with an equilibrium pressure that varies with the density , leading to a spatially extended phase - transition region of non - negligible thickness with respect to the star s radius @xcite . on the contrary , in the traditional maxwell construction the phases are in `` contact '' each other .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in these treatments the pure phases are subjected to the condition of local charge neutrality , and so they do not account for the possible interior coulomb fields .",
    "indeed , the complete equilibrium of the multicomponent fluid in the cores of compact stars needs the presence of a coulomb potential formed by electric charge separation due to gravito - polarization effects @xcite , favoring a sharp core - crust transition that ensures the global , but not the local , charge neutrality ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "besides the core - crust transition , additional phase - transitions as the ones allowed by quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) could occur within the core of the star itself ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . from all the above we can conclude that ultradense stars such as neutron stars shows necessarily a nontrivial stratification . between any two phases , which can be very different",
    ", it is reasonable to investigate the situation where some quantities are discontinuous , e.g.  the energy - density and the pressure .",
    "such discontinuities can be harnessed by appropriate surface tensions .",
    "these surface quantities influence the stability of a system adding new boundary conditions to the problem which , as we shall show here , modify the set of eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of a star .    in this work",
    "we analyze the problem of perturbations in systems constituted of various phases that are split by surfaces that host nontrivial degrees of freedom .",
    "this analysis is thought to be a generalization of the treatment for continuous systems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein , for a comprehensive analysis of properties , types and stability of continuous anisotropic fluids also in presence of radiation and heat flux ) .",
    "by investigating the dynamics of perturbations , we are automatically probing the stability of systems .",
    "we shall trammel ourselves to the simplest possible case : spherically symmetric extended bodies where radial perturbations take place . in order to model the problem",
    ", we shall assume these surfaces of discontinuity separating two arbitrary phases are very thin and a generalized distributional approach @xcite shall be adopted .",
    "we start our analysis in the newtonian case in order to gain intuition of the relevant aspects of the problem , and finally we generalize it to general relativity . our purpose is solely to expound the problem and seek to solve it as generically as we can .",
    "our analysis is far from being complete and has to be considered as a first step towards deeper investigations and scrutinies of specific cases shall be the object of posterior studies .",
    "we show in this work that phase transitions in the presence of surface degrees of freedom can be enclosed into additional boundary conditions to the problem .",
    "besides , our formalism tells us that such boundary conditions are only self - consistent when the set of eigenfrequencies of the perturbation modes is related to the global system , not with individual phases .",
    "this is consistent with the well - known results from coupled springs , where there are only global frequencies .",
    "the presence of further boundary conditions naturally modify the possible set of eigenfrequencies , since we are inserting further restrictive aspects to the physical oscillation modes .",
    "therefore , measurements on the pulsation modes in a star could tell us very precisely about its internal structure , being a sort of fingerprint , which could help to understand better the nature of these systems .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we formulate the problem of radial perturbations of stars with interfaces in the classical newtonian case . for the sake of exemplification",
    ", we compute the specific solution of the stability equation in section  [ sec:3 ] for the simple case of incompressible stars , scrutinizing which circumstances deliver us enough arbitrary constants to fix additional boundary conditions . in section  [ sec:5 ]",
    "we give the formulation in the case of systems with electric charge but still within newtonian gravity . the formulation in the case of general relativity in the neutral case",
    "is presented in section  [ sec:6 ] , while in section  [ sec:7 ] we extend the general relativistic treatment to systems endowed with electric charge .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec:8 ] we summarize and discuss the main results of this work .",
    "we use units such that @xmath3 and the metric signature @xmath4 throughout the article , unless otherwise stated .",
    "assume a continuous classical astrophysical system with spherical symmetry .",
    "when its volume elements are perturbed radially , it is well - known ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the evolution of perturbations of the form @xmath5 with @xmath6 an arbitrary constant , is described by @xmath7-\\frac{4}{r}\\frac{dp}{dr}\\xi + \\omega^2\\rho\\xi=0\\label{perteq},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the pressure of the background system under hydrostatic equilibrium and @xmath9 with @xmath10 the mass density of the system .",
    "formulated in this way , we have at hands an eigenvalue problem . for the case of continuous systems , the boundary conditions to be supplemented to eq .",
    "( [ perteq ] ) are quite simple . they are directly related to the spherical symmetry of the system , as well as to the vanishing of its pressure on its border even in the presence of perturbations ( other situations where a surface tension be present could also be envisaged and we shall attempt to elaborate on them in the sequel ) .",
    "in other words , we impose that @xmath11 where @xmath12 was defined as the radius of the star , such that @xmath13 . for further details about these boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "( [ perteq ] ) supplemented with eq .",
    "( [ boundarycont ] ) constitutes a sturm - liouville problem , where the aspects of its solutions are already known . concerning the eigenfrequencies ,",
    "@xmath14 , they are all real and form a discrete hierarchical set .",
    "when one seeks for stable solutions to eq .",
    "( [ perteq ] ) , one seeks for solutions with positive @xmath14 , specially for its fundamental mode . as it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) , negative values of @xmath14 indicate instabilities in the assumed background system , which leads to the conclusion that they do not linger on in time .",
    "they would either implode or explode .",
    "we now turn to the more involved problem of permitting the system to be stratified and harboring surface degrees of freedom on the interface of two given phases .",
    "such degrees of freedom have themselves a dynamics , described generically by the thin - shell formalism or darmois - israel formalism @xcite .",
    "we are here however particularly interested in another aspect of the problem , namely to understand the role such degrees of freedom play on the stability of the system when its parts ( defined naturally by the hypersurface that hosts the aforesaid degrees of freedom ) are perturbed .",
    "therefore , before anything , it is assumed that for being meaningful to talk about this scenario , one has that the hypersurfaces of discontinuity themselves are stable ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for further details ) .",
    "if this is not the case , any displacement of the hypersurface of discontinuity would trigger a cataclysmic set of events that would have as a result the disruption of the system .",
    "one expects that the stratified problem could be accounted for additional boundary conditions to the system .",
    "the reason for this is that the perturbations in the upper and lower regions with respect to a given surface of discontinuity would be described by the same physics [ e.g.  eq .",
    "( [ perteq ] ) ] , as well as the totality of the matches .",
    "the only missing points would be their connection ( allowing combinations of solutions to be also solutions to the physical equations involved ) and generalization by means of surface quantities .",
    "for example , the existence of a surface tension would account to an extra surface force term .",
    "the same ensues with the presence of a surface mass ( enclosed by a surface mass density ) and the associated presence of a surface gravitational force .",
    "therefore , in order to properly describe stratified systems , one must make use of distributions @xcite .",
    "we proceed now with the distributional generalization of the equations describing continuous fluids under gravitational fields .",
    "assume that a surface harboring surface degrees of freedom of a system in equilibrium is at @xmath15 .",
    "the first equation to be generalized in terms of distributions in this case is the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this should now read @xmath16 where @xmath17 has been defined as the norm of the gravitational field , solution to ( the distributional ) poisson s equation @xmath18 , @xmath19 , that can always be written as @xmath20 besides , @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ hydrostaticeq ] ) stands for the surface tension @xcite on the surface of discontinuity at @xmath15 .",
    "the expression on the aforesaid equation is the result of restoring surface forces ( this is the reason they have an opposite direction to the pressure gradient ) at a small surface area ( the factor @xmath22 comes from the principal curvatures in a surface element , which in the spherically symmetric case are equal ) .",
    "the gravitational force from the sheet of mass at @xmath15 is naturally incorporated on the distributional definitions of @xmath23 and @xmath17 as we shall show in the sequel .",
    "the mass density , on the other hand , must be expressed as @xmath24 with @xmath25 the heaviside function , whose derivative is the dirac delta function @xmath26 in the sense of distributions . from the existence of a surface mass density",

    "therefore , @xmath17 could be represented distributionally as @xmath31 the above equation means that the associated distributional gravitational potential @xmath32 ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) is always a continuous function , though not differentiable at a surface of discontinuity .",
    "besides , we will assume that also the pressure can be discontinuous at @xmath15 , being hence written as @xmath35 the reason of why this is so will be clarified when we deal with our original problem in the scope of general relativity . the heuristic argument corroborating the validity of eq .",
    "( [ pdistr ] ) is that it is meaningless to colligate a surface term to the radial pressure , since its associated force would necessarily be normal to it and therefore would not lie on the surface . only tangential pressures should have tied within their surface terms . from eqs .",
    "( [ pdistr ] ) , ( [ rhodistr ] ) , ( [ gravfield ] ) ( [ gravfieldjump ] ) and ( [ gravfielddistr ] ) , we have @xmath36^+_- + \\frac{g}{16\\pi r^3}[m^2(r)]^+_- \\label{surfacetension}\\ ] ] and @xmath37 the arithmetic average present in eq .  ( [ surfacetension ] )",
    "[ see the definition of @xmath17 and the value of @xmath38 is a general consequence of the product of delta functions with heaviside ones in the generalized sense of distributions @xcite .",
    "notice from eq .",
    "( [ surfacetension ] ) that its first term is the known young - laplace equation for spherical surfaces at equilibrium ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * see , e.g. , ) , where just geometric aspects are taken into account for the surface tension . its second term , though , is the gravitational surface tension , uniquely due to the non - zero surface mass . if the surface tension were null , the pressure jump could not be arbitrary , but proportional to the surface mass density and must be a monotonically decreasing function of the radial coordinate [ see eqs .",
    "( [ gravfieldjump ] ) and ( [ surfacetension ] ) ] . from eq .",
    "( [ surfacetension ] ) , one sees further that the force per unit area associated with the surface tension is exactly the one necessary to counterbalance both the forces coming from the pressure gradient at @xmath27 and the surface gravitational force , as it should be .",

    "( [ hydrostaticeqdistr ] ) ] and automatically gives the surface tension at @xmath27 that guarantees the hydrostatic equilibrium for arbitrary pressure jumps and surface masses .",
    "we will keep the same philosophy now concerning the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ perteq ] ) . from our generalized hydrostatic equilibrium equation , we have that an important term for the deduction of the equation governing radial perturbations would be the application of the lagrangian operator @xmath39 [ @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 being a physical quantity in the equilibrium and perturbed cases , respectively ] on the surface force in eq .",

    "this means that we are endowing the fluid at the surface of discontinuity with adiabatic properties and the underlying microphysics is not contemplated in this procedure . for continuous media , the total mass in the interface of two phases is generally not a constant .",

    "we have derived the relevant equations defining this boundary - value problem for both neutral and charged stars and in newtonian and einstein s gravity .",
    "it makes use of the generalized theory of distributions , since we assumed that the surfaces of discontinuity are thin , that they host surface degrees of freedom , and that the phases separated by them do not mix .",
    "we showed that though the phases may be very different amongst themselves , when perturbations take place , they lead to the notion of a set of eigenfrequencies describing the whole system , instead of an independent set for each phase .",
    "besides , our formalism gave us as a consequence the proper additional boundary conditions to be taken into account when working with stratified systems .",
    "such boundary conditions encompass surface degrees of freedom in the surfaces of discontinuity and generically modify the set of eigenfrequencies with respect to their continuous counterpart .",
    "this should be a generic fingerprint of stratified systems with nontrivial surface degrees of freedom .",
    "our analyses are relevant for the assessment of the stability of realistic star models , since they ensue the precise notion of boundary conditions .",
    "it was not our objective to systematically apply our formalism here , but simply to derive and expound it .",

    "thus , the measurement of the star s eigenmodes becomes of major relevance , since it could give information not only on the star s bulk structure but also on the possible existence of interior interfaces and their associate microphysical and electromagnetic phenomena .",
    "the radial instabilities shown in our analyses should be interpreted analogously as for continuous stars since , even in the stratified case , a global set of eigenfrequencies raises .",
    "thus , stratified stars would either implode or explode when they are radially unstable . though we were concerned only with radial perturbations",
    ", it is of interest to investigate the additional oscillation modes owing to nonradial perturbations .",
    "the only point to be added , with respect to continuous stars , is the proper redefinition of the surfaces of discontinuity when such perturbations take place .",
    "this is clearly a richer scenario that insert additional degrees of freedom into the system , leading to the appearance of additional modes such as the gravitational ` g - modes ' ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
