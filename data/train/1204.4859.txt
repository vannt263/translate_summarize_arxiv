    "the study of the @xmath0-mesons in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions has consistently been considered to be a potentially powerful tool for studying the properties of the hypothetical ` hot and dense matter ' created in these collisions .",
    "predictions about the @xmath1 of @xmath0-meson production in the nuclear collision , at certain stages @xcite and an anomalous @xmath2 at certain other stage as well @xcite are always treated as very powerful diagnostics .",
    "the deciding factor , in terms of the standard model ( sm ) , in both the cases , is the number of charm - anticharm ( @xmath3 ) pairs ( @xmath4 ) created in the early stage of hard parton collisions in @xmath5 ( or in @xmath6 ) reactions . on the basis of it",
    ", one might arrive at the assumptions of the @xmath0-@xmath1 ( at @xmath7 ) and the @xmath0-@xmath2 ( at @xmath8 ) effects .    in the past",
    "@xcite-@xcite we had constantly refrained from giving such undue importance to any controversy about either suppression / enhanced suppression or an enhancement of @xmath0 mesons in reality .",
    "rather our primary intent would centre around understanding and interpreting the nature of data of inclusive cross - sections and some other important observables of @xmath0 mesons in bnl - rhic and cern - lhc experiments .",
    "in fact , we have an altogether different and heretic view ( which will be outlined very briefly in the next section ) about the mechanism of @xmath0 production in high energy particle and nuclear collisions .",
    "we define our objectives here as : 1 ) to explain the main and major features of the latest data on @xmath0-production in bnl - rhic and cern - lhc experiments from the proposed alternative approach built up by us in a set of previous works done in the both the remote and recent past @xcite-@xcite and 2 ) to compare our model - based calculations with some other competing models .",
    "our plan of work presented here is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we provide brief outlines of the models chosen for this study .",
    "the section 3 provides very brief outlines of the models which are founded on the gantlets of assumptions of the ` standard'-model and which have been reckoned with for the sake of comparison . in section 4",
    "we give the results and general discussion . and in the last section ( section 5 ) we offer the final remarks - cum - conclusions .",
    "in the present work , we will make use of a theoretical model to interpret some of the latest and topical observables of the j/@xmath9 production which were measured and reported by the different groups in the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments in the recent past .",
    "the model has a modest degree of dynamical basis and some prior check - ups with data @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is called here as the sequential chain model ( scm ) .",
    "the outline and features of the model we use here are obtained , in the main , from our previous works @xcite-@xcite . according to this model , high energy hadronic interactions boil down , essentially , to the pion - pion interactions ; as the protons are conceived in this model as @xmath10=(@xmath11@xmath12@xmath13 ) , where @xmath13 is a spectator particle needed for the dynamical generation of quantum numbers of the nucleons .",
    "the multiple production of @xmath0-mesons in a high energy proton - proton collisions is described in the following way .",
    "the secondary @xmath14-meson or the exchanged @xmath15-meson emit a free @xmath16-meson and pi - meson ; the pions so produced at high energies could liberate another pair of free @xmath15 and trapped @xmath16-mesons ( in the multiple production chain ) . these so - called free @xmath15 and @xmath16-mesons decay quite a fast into photons and these photons decay into @xmath9 or @xmath17 particles , which , according to this alternative approach is a bound state of @xmath18 or @xmath19 particles .",
    "the inclusive cross - section of the @xmath9-meson produced in the @xmath20 collisions given by @xmath21 where the expression for for average multiplicity for @xmath9-particles in @xmath20 scattering would be given by @xmath22 in the above expression , the term @xmath23 is a normalisation parameter and is assumed here to have a value @xmath24 for intersecting storage ring(isr ) energy , and it is different for different energy and for various collisions .",
    "the terms @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the transverse momentum , feynman scaling variable and the rest mass of the @xmath0 particle respectively . moreover , by definition , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the longitudinal momentum of the particle .",
    "the @xmath30 in equation ( 2 ) is the square of the c.m .",
    "energy .    the second term in the right hand side of the equation ( 1 )",
    ", the constituent rearrangement term arises out of the partonic rearrangements inside the proton .",
    "it is established that hadrons ( baryons and mesons ) are composed of few partons .",
    "these rearrangements mean undesirable loss of energy , in so far as the production mechanism is concerned .",
    "the choice of @xmath31 would depend on the following factors : ( i ) the specificities of the interacting projectile and target , ( ii ) the particularities of the secondaries emitted from a specific hadronic or nuclear interaction and ( iii ) the magnitudes of the momentum transfers and of a phase factor ( with a maximum value of unity ) in the rearrangement process in any collision .",
    "the parametrisation is to be done for two physical points , viz . ,",
    "the amount of momentum transfer and the contributions from a phase factor arising out of the rearrangement of the constituent partons . collecting and combining all these",
    ", we propose the relation to be given by @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the average number of participating nucleons and @xmath34 values are to be obtained phenomenologically from the fits to the data - points @xcite .    in order to study a nuclear interaction of the type @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are projectile and target nucleus respectively , and @xmath38 is the detected particle which , in the present case , would be @xmath0-mesons , the scm has been adapted , on the basis of the suggested wong @xcite work to the glauber techniques . the inclusive cross - sections for @xmath0 production in different nuclear interactions of the types @xmath39 in the light of this modified sequential chain model ( scm ) can then be written in the following generalised form as : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the factors to be calculated under certain physical constraints .",
    "the set of relations to be used for evaluating the parameters @xmath41 is given below .",
    "@xmath44 here , in the above set of equations , the third factor gives a measure of the number of wounded nucleons i.e. of the probable number of participants , wherein @xmath45 gives the probability cross - section of collision with ` @xmath37 ' nucleus ( target ) , had all the nucleons of @xmath36 suffered collisions with @xmath37-target .",
    "and @xmath46 has just the same physical meaning , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 replaced .",
    "besides , in expression ( 5 ) , the fourth term is a physical factor related with energy degradation of the secondaries due to multiple collision effects . the parameter @xmath47 occurring in eqn.(5 ) above is a measure of the fraction of the nucleons that suffer energy loss .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath47 is unity , while all the nucleons suffer energy loss .",
    "this @xmath47 parameter is usually to be chosen @xcite , depending on the centrality of the collisions and the nature of the secondaries .",
    "the  @xmath48 \" factor in the expression ( 5 ) accommodates a wide range of variation because of the existence of the large differences in the in the normalizations of the @xmath0 cross - sections for different types of interactions .",
    "in this approach @xcite , it is assumed that the nuclear wave functions in very high - energy nuclear collisions can be described by the color glass condensate ( cgc ) .",
    "the primary effect is the suppression of @xmath0 production and narrowing of the rapidity distribution due to saturation of the gluon fields in heavy ion collisions relative to @xmath49 collisions .",
    "in addition , the production mechanism is modified from @xmath49 such that the multigluon exchange diagrams are enhanced in heavy ion reactions .",
    "it should be noted that this model does not include any hot medium effects , but does have a free parameter for the overall normalization factor .",
    "the quark coalescence model ( qcm ) @xcite , is a two - stage simulation . in stage",
    "i the incoming target and projectile nucleon interactions are tracked , a fluid of pre - hadrons are formed and in stage ii the produced pre - hadrons interact and decay in a standard relativistic cascade model .",
    "the time history of all the collisions recorded in stage i sets up the geometry and initial conditions for stage ii .",
    "basic inputs for the simulation are measured hadron - hadron crosssections , rapidity , transverse momentum and particle multiplicity distributions , of which the last are conforming to kno scaling .",
    "the basic assumption of the model is coalescence of charm quarks and anti - quarks into charmonia ( @xmath50 charmonium ) , which can also be viewed as heavy pre - hadrons in stage i. only a small percentage of charm quarks are expected to coalesce into bound charmonia i.e. @xmath0 , the remainder of such quarks appear ultimately as open charm mesons . at rhic energies comover suppression of directly produced charmonia",
    "is expected to be large , due to the increased particle numbers and densities .",
    "a mechanism called double color filtering for @xmath3 dipoles @xcite , makes nuclei significantly more transparent in @xmath51 than @xmath52 collisions .",
    "the assumption of this model is as follows : in the c.m . of nuclear collision the nuclear disks passing through each other leave behind a cloud of radiated gluons creating a dense matter , which the @xmath0 propagates through . in this reference",
    "frame the @xmath0 full momentum is @xmath25 , which ranges from zero to several gev in rhic data .",
    "such a low energy @xmath3 dipole develops the @xmath0 wave function pretty fast , during time @xmath53 fm , which is about the time scale of the medium creation .",
    "thus , what is propagating through the medium is not a small @xmath3 dipole , but a fully formed @xmath0 .",
    "the observed nuclear effects in @xmath0 production in @xmath51 collisions is interpreted as a combination of final state interaction ( fsi ) of @xmath0 in the dense medium , and the initial state interaction ( isi ) effects in production of @xmath0 caused by multiple interactions of the colliding nuclei .",
    "now let us proceed to apply the chosen model to interpret some recent experimental results of @xmath0-production reported by various groups for different collisions like @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 at rhic and @xmath54 , @xmath58 at lhc . here , the main observables are the invariant yields , rapidity distributions and the nuclear modification factors which would come under purview of the present work .      as the psi - productions are generically treated rightly as the resonance particles , the standard practice is to express the measured @xmath0 ( total ) crosssections times branching ratio to muon or electrons , i.e.for lepton pairs , that is by @xmath59 .        in fig .",
    "1(a ) and fig .",
    "1(b ) , we have drawn the solid lines depicting the scm model - based results with the help of above equations ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) , ( 8) , ( 9 ) against the experimental measurements @xcite , @xcite respectively .",
    "for the calculation of the rapidity distribution from the equation ( 4 ) we can make use of a standard relation as given below : @xmath76 for @xmath54 collisions , the calculated rapidity distribution equation at rhic - energy @xmath62 = 200 gev is @xmath77 in fig .",
    "2 we have plotted the rapidity distributions for @xmath0-production in @xmath54 collisions at @xmath62 = 200 gev .",
    "data in the figure are taken from ref . @xcite and the line shows the scm - based output .    in a similar fashion ,",
    "the scm - based rapidity distribution equation at lhc - energy @xmath62 = 7 tev in @xmath54 collisions has been given hereunder @xmath78 in figure 3 , we have drawn the solid lines depicting the scm - based results with the help of above equation ( 12 ) against the experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "there is yet another very important observable called nuclear modification factor ( nmf ) , denoted here by @xmath89 which for the production of @xmath0 is defined by @xcite @xmath90 the scm - based results on nmfs for @xmath56 and @xmath57 collisions for forward rapidities are deduced on the basis of eqn.(6 ) , eqn.(15 ) , eqn.(17 ) and eqn .",
    "( 19 ) and they are given by the undernoted relations @xmath91 and @xmath92 herein the value of @xmath93 to be used is @xmath94 @xcite for @xmath56 collisions and for @xmath57 collisions it is taken as @xmath95 @xcite .    in fig .",
    "7(a ) , we plot @xmath89 vs. @xmath25 for @xmath85 central region in @xmath56 and @xmath57 collisions .",
    "the solid lines in the figure show the scm - based results against the experimentally measured results @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the dotted lines in the fig . represent the double color filtering approach @xcite . and in fig .",
    "7(b ) , we plot @xmath89 vs. @xmath96 for @xmath85 central region in @xmath57 collisions at @xmath62 = 200 gev and for @xmath58 collisions at @xmath62 = 2.76 tev .",
    "the solid lines in the figure show the scm - based results against the experimentally measured results from refs . @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the dashed lines in the fig . represent the gluon saturation approach @xcite .",
    "let us first concentrate on what we have achieved here : ( i ) the features related to @xmath25-spectra for @xmath0 production in some particle - particle and nuclear collisions at various high energies have been reproduced quite successfully .",
    "( ii ) the characteristics of rapidity spectra in @xmath20 collisions at tev energies have been brought out somwhat modestly satisfactorily .",
    "( iii ) the features of nuclear modification factors in @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 reactions at rhic and lhc energies have been worked out with the help of the applied model . besides",
    ", some of our model - based results have also been compared with the performances on the same observables by some competing models of ` standard ' variety . and",
    "these comparisons with data and the results obtained by some other models reveal that scm - based results are in better agreement with data than the other approaches grounded on the ` standard ' model ilk . and this observation is no accident or coincidence . in the past",
    "such were the recurrent observations made by us valid for many other obsevables measured in the various high statistics high energy particle and nuclear experiments .",
    "thus , summing up our past experiences and considering the weightage of the results reported here , we are forced to comment finally that this work essentially represents a case of paradigm shift in the domain of particle theory , as we have eschewed the conventional views of @xmath97 approach to @xmath0 production in the ` standard ' framework . and",
    "this is just the reflection of our radical views about the particle structure and the nature of particle collisions .",
    "obviously we obtain the fair agreement with data on some observables without inductions of ( i ) any qgp concept , ( ii ) any prognosis of suppression or enhancement of @xmath0-production .",
    "the production characteristics resemble all other hadrons .",
