    ". the jlab @xmath4 measurement will clarify the details of the tensor - polarized distributions in 2020 s .",
    "together with their data , we expect that the drell - yan measurements will clarify the tensor - polarized antiquark distributions .",
    "we explained our studies on the tensor - polarized structure function @xmath4 and tensor - polarized quark and antiquark distributions , @xmath85 and @xmath241 .",
    "first , the projection operators are shown for all the eight structure functions of the deuteron from the hadron tensor @xmath154 .",
    "the projection operators should be useful in a convolution description of the deuteron structure functions .",
    "second , the sum rule was explained for @xmath4 by using the parton model . it is valuable for indicating the existence of antiquark tensor polarization , as the gottfried sum rule violation indicated a @xmath242 asymmetry in the nucleon . third , the parametrization of the tensor - polarized quark and antiquark distributions was proposed by analyzing the hermes data on @xmath4 .",
    "the analysis indicated an existence of antiquark tensor polarization , and its origin should be investigated theoretically .",
    "the tensor - polarized antiquark distributions should be studied by the drell - yan processes with tensor - polarized deuteron .",
    "we showed the general formalisms for the structure functions in the proton - deuteron drell - yan processes and also their expressions in terms of the parton distribution functions in the proton and deuteron . with the tensor - polarized deuteron , the drell - yan process probes the tensor - polarized antiquark distributions directly .",
    "the jlab experiment on @xmath4 was approved and the actual measurement is expected to start in 2019 .",
    "there are other possibilities to investigate the tensor structure at eic , fermilab , j - parc , gsi , and cern - compass .",
    "the studies of tensor - polarized structure functions could open a new era of high - energy spin physics .",

    "<S> the new structure functions are @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 in deep inelastic scattering of a charged - lepton from a spin - one hadron such as the deuteron . among them , twist - two functions are related by the callan - gross type relation @xmath8 in the bjorken scaling limit . </S>",
    "<S> first , these new structure functions are introduced , and useful formulae are derived for projection operators of @xmath9 from a hadron tensor @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> second , a sum rule is explained for @xmath4 , and possible tensor - polarized distributions are discussed by using hermes data in order to propose future experimental measurements and to compare them with theoretical models . </S>",
    "<S> a proposal was approved to measure @xmath4 at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) , so that much progress is expected for @xmath4 in the near future . </S>",
    "<S> third , formalisms of polarized proton - deuteron drell - yan processes are explained for probing especially tensor - polarized antiquark distributions , which were suggested by the hermes data . </S>",
    "<S> the studies of the tensor - polarized structure functions will open a new era in 2020 s for tensor - structure studies in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom , which is much different from ordinary descriptions in terms of nucleons and mesons . </S>"
