    "interference is one of the most fascinating topics in optical physics . since its first implementation by young @xcite",
    ", many interesting phenomena have been studied @xcite .",
    "both in classical and quantum physics , the key notion to understand interference is the superposition principle . in classical physics ,",
    "light is considered as electromagnetic waves and the superposition of these waves explains the interference effects . on the other hand , when a photon , a light quantum , is considered in quantum physics",
    ", the superposition of probability amplitudes describes the interference . despite the different analogies , both classical and quantum descriptions typically give the same results for first - order or single - photon interference .",
    "for example , a young s double - slit interference experiment performed with either coherent light or single - photon states show the same interference fringes .    these results ,",
    "however , become different when second - order or two - photon interference is explored @xcite .",
    "let us consider a typical two - photon interference scenario , the hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) interference @xcite .",
    "when two identical optical pulses are combined at a beamsplitter ( bs ) , the photons ( or optical pulses in classical physics ) are inclined to be detect at the same output of the bs , thus resulting in suppression of coincidences between the two outputs of the bs .",
    "this phenomenon is referred as a hom dip , and the visibility of the hom dip is defined as the relative depth of the dip compared to the non - interfering terms . using single - photon states ,",
    "the coincidences can be completely suppressed , so the visibility can reach @xmath2 . on the other hand , classical electromagnetic waves superposition theory provides that a hom dip with only @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "thus , the visibility of @xmath0 in hom interference is usually considered as the border between classical and quantum physics .",
    "because of the fundamental interest in the _ quantum _ nature of light , there has been a lot of research on two - photon quantum interference .",
    "these include two - photon coherence @xcite , quantum beating @xcite , induced interference@xcite , and so on .",
    "the rapidly developing quantum information science has also boosted research on two - photon quantum interference @xcite .",
    "note that two - photon quantum interference is essential for many quantum information protocols including linear optics quantum computation @xcite .",
    "recent research shows that the two - photon interference with classical light can sometimes imitate quantum interference and thus it can be useful for quantum information science .",
    "for example , ghost imaging or ghost interference , which was considered as a result of two - photon quantum interference , can be implemented with classical light sources @xcite .",
    "since the implementation of classical light sources is much easier than that of quantum light sources , these results show the practical benefits of two - photon classical interference for quantum information science .",
    "thus , the study of two - photon classical interference is not only important for a better understanding of the nature of interference but also for applications in quantum information science .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically and experimentally study two - photon interference with continuous - wave ( cw ) multi - mode coherent light .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : we first introduce our scenario of two - photon interference with cw coherent light and provide a qualitative discussion .",
    "then , we provide a quantitative theoretical analysis based on the superposition of electromagnetic waves .",
    "the theory is verified by experimental demonstration and results that follow .",
    "finally , we will summarize our work and conclude .",

    "[ setup ] ( a ) shows our scenario of two - photon interference with cw coherent light . the multi - mode property will be considered in the next section .",
    "two attenuated cw coherent light beams interfere at a bs and are measured at the outputs of the bs .",
    "the two - photon measurement is accomplished by two single - photon detectors , d1and d2 , and a time - correlated single - photon counter ( tcspc ) which registers the detection time difference between two inputs ; start and stop . for the interferometric measurement , we introduce two variables : @xmath4 and @xmath5 which denote the optical delay and the detection time difference at the tcspc , respectively .",
    "note that the optical delay @xmath4 can be changed by varying the optical length of an input .",
    "let us first consider the interference in terms of @xmath4 .",
    "this two - photon interference is usually configured with optical pulses and the coincidences at d1 and d2 yield a hom interference .",
    "since the timing is well defined for optical pulses , @xmath4 would introduce an optical delay with respect to the reference optical pulse , @xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ setup ] ( a ) .",
    "thus , by varying @xmath4 , one can expect to see two - photon interference with either single - photon states or coherent pulses @xcite .",
    "our interest in this paper is , however , cw coherent light . for cw light ,",
    "the timing is not well defined , and therefore the meaning of the optical delay is ambiguous . without varying the optical delay , it is hard to envision the interference phenomenon . for arbitrary cw coherent light inputs ,",
    "the varying of @xmath4 does not change the arbitrary nature of the inputs and therefore it would not introduce interference .",
    "however , in contrast to intuition , we will show that the two - photon interference can be observed if a certain condition is satisfied .",
    "the intuitive understanding of the two - photon classical interference in terms of @xmath5 is difficult .",
    "however , similar experiments with single - photon states can provide a hint .",
    "legero , _ et al _ investigated the two - photon interference in terms of @xmath5 with single - photon states and observed two - photon quantum beating when the spectral frequencies of single - photon states are different @xcite .",
    "the beating fringes show a sinusoidal oscillation with the visibility of @xmath2 . based on this result",
    ", we can expect sinusoidal beat fringes for the two - photon classical interference with respect to @xmath5 . as the visibility of two - photon classical interference",
    "is limited by @xmath0 , we also can presume the visibility of the fringes would be @xmath3 .",
    "we will see the two - photon beating can indeed be observed with cw coherent light .",
    "since we are dealing with classical light , we can describe two - photon interference phenomena by the superposition of electromagnetic waves . to this end , let us consider the electric fields @xmath7 at the inputs ( @xmath8 ) and outputs ( @xmath9 ) of the bs as depicted in fig .",
