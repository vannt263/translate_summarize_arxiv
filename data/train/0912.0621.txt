    "radio source samples , selected at high frequency and with flux densities of the order of 1  jy , mostly contain compact flat spectrum objects associated with the nuclei of active galaxies which have relativistic outflows pointing close to the direction of the observer ( e.g. blandford & rees 1978 ; scheuer & readhead 1979 ; orr & browne 1982 ) .",
    "this emission consists of a number of synchrotron components , each with a steep optically thin synchrotron spectrum at high frequencies and a self - absorbed spectrum at lower frequencies ; the combination of many such components with different cutoff frequencies produces the observed `` flat '' radio spectrum .",
    "these components are frequently linearly polarized , and in principle useful information on jet physics can be obtained from the distribution of polarization in frequency and space .",
    "although high frequency - selected samples are dominated by flat spectrum objects the samples do contain a minority of intrinsically more powerful sources in which the extended , steep - spectrum synchrotron emission dominates rather than the emission from a beamed core",
    ". such sources also display linearly polarized emission , often at a higher level than the flat spectrum sources .    in recent years",
    "there has been particular interest in high - frequency properties of radio sources because discrete radio sources act as a confusing foreground for measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( e.g. tegmark & efstathiou 1996 ) .",
    "such sources contribute most to the power spectrum on small angular scales ( high @xmath1 ) , and efforts have been made to subtract their effects in several different ways . for total intensity , high frequency observations of sources selected from lower frequency surveys have been used .",
    "for example , the very small array cmb interferometer , working at 31  ghz , used 15-ghz source - finding observations with the ryle telescope followed by monitoring of discrete sources with dedicated long baselines ( dickinson et al .",
    "2004 ) and/or single dish observations made with the torun 32  m ( gawronski et al . 2009 ) , while for the cosmic background imager experiment high frequency observations were made with the ovro 42  m and gbt of sources selected at 1.4  ghz ( mason et al .",
    "2003 ; mason et al .",
    "2009 ) . alternatively",
    ", population models based on extrapolations from lower frequency catalogues can be used statistically to ameliorate the effects of the extragalactic source foreground .",
    "although large - scale blind surveys at high frequencies are difficult to do , because of the small field of view at high frequencies , there are a number of both blind and pointed surveys in existence .",
    "the southern hemisphere has been completely surveyed by the at20 g survey ( ricci et al .",
    "2004 ) , which has been conducted with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) at 18  ghz down to a limiting flux density of 50  mjy .",
    "a detailed study of brighter sources in this survey has been presented by massardi et al .",
    "the whole sky has been covered to a brighter limiting flux density of about 1jy by wmap at a number of frequencies @xmath220  ghz ( wright et al .",
    "2009 ) , and smaller areas of the northern sky have been covered to greater depth by surveys such as the 15-ghz 9c survey ( waldram et al .",
    "these surveys generally find that sources that are bright at high frequencies have complex spectra . about 30% are significantly inverted ( ricci et al .",
    "2004 ) , and the mean spectral index around 2040 ghz tends to be around zero , generally steepening at higher frequencies ( ricci et al .",
    "2006 ; massardi et al .",
    "2008 ; volvach et al .",
    "there is some evidence that the spectra of most sources turn over by 95  ghz ( sadler et al .",
    "2008 ) but in general extrapolation to both higher frequencies and to lower flux density levels is needed in order to realistically simulate the cmb discrete foregrounds ( e.g. waldram et al .",
    "importantly , there is convincing evidence that the mix of flat and steep spectrum sources changes with flux density .",
    "this is a prediction of beaming models ( e.g. orr & browne 1982 ; wall & jackson 1997 ) .",
    "there is also direct observational evidence provided by gawronski et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that the proportion of steep - spectrum sources with extended radio emission increases from @xmath320% in a wmap 22-ghz sample to @xmath250% in ryle - selected 15-ghz sample which has a flux density limit about two orders of magnitude weaker than that of the wmap sample .",
    "thus care must be taken when extrapolating to both higher frequencies and lower flux densities .",
    "the sensitivity of instruments such as planck require this to be done as accurately as possible , and hence it is important to base the models on as firm an observational footing as possible .",
    "the situation with polarized foregrounds is less developed but it is becoming urgent to solve because inflation models make different predictions for the strength of b - modes in the cmb polarization distribution .",
    "a heroic effort is going into experiments to detect b - modes .",
    "these include planck and ground - based projects like quiet ( samtleben 2008 ) and the balloon - borne experiment spider ( montroy et al .",
    "all cmb observations are technically challenging because they rely on extreme stability of the equipment and on meticulous subtraction of foregrounds to get at the true distribution of the cmb fluctuations .",
    "the detection of the b - mode signal will be particularly difficult ( though just how difficult depends on its strength which varies over a wide range depending on the inflation model ) . for scalar - to - tensor ratio r=0.01 ,",
    "the peak signal ( at around 1@xmath4 scales ) is @xmath530nk .",
    "b - mode experiments operate at high frequencies ( e.g. quiet : 44 and 90ghz ; spider : 90 , 145 and 220  ghz ; planck 30,70 , 100 , 143 , 217 and 353  ghz ) .",
    "hence observations at the highest frequencies possible are desirable .",
    "estimates of synchrotron source total intensity contamination have been made by extrapolating from observations made at 1.4 and 5  ghz ( e.g. tucci et al .",
    "the current best - guess models are presented by toffolatti et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2005 ) .",
    "however , additional assumptions need to be made if the polarized foreground is to be characterized ; one needs to know about the high frequency polarization properties of sources .",
    "ideally one would like direct observations of polarized source counts but this is impractical .",
    "an alternative is to use high frequency total intensity source counts and a knowledge of how the percentage polarizations of sources change with both frequency and flux density to predict polarized source counts .",
    "the work reported in this paper is the first phase in a programme aimed at improving knowledge about the polarization properties of radio sources at high radio frequencies .",
    "we begin with bright sources from the wmap sample of wright et al .",
    "( 2009 ) which have @xmath61  jy . in this work ,",
    "all but four of the sample of 203 wmap sources with flux density of @xmath21  jy at 22  ghz and with declination @xmath7 have been imaged with the vla in total intensity and polarization .",
    "the second phase of our programme will be to measure the polarization properties of a high frequency - selected sample of much weaker sources designed to look for any dependence of polarization properties on flux density . given that gawronski et al .",
    "( 2009 ) find that the population mix changes with flux density there is every reason to expect that average polarization properties also change .",
    "observations were conducted using the vla in d - configuration between 01.40 and 19.30 ut on 2008 august 1 . during this period 16",
    "antennas were equipped with evla receivers while the remaining 11 had original vla receivers .",
    "each source was normally observed at three frequencies : two 50-mhz bands centred on 8.4351 and 8.4851 ghz ( x - band ) , two 50-mhz bands centred on 22.4351 and 22.4851 ghz ( k - band ) , and two 50-mhz bands centred on 43.3149 and 43.3649 mhz ( q - band ) .",
    "pointing calibration was carried out approximately every 15 - 20 minutes .",
    "the available time allowed observations to be made of all the sources at 22  ghz and 43  ghz , and approximately two - thirds of the sources at 8  ghz .",
    "four sources ( wmap  0823 + 224 , wmap  0824 + 392 , wmap  1014 + 231 and wmap  1840 + 797 ) were missed during the observations , leaving a total of 199 sources out of 203 with attempted measurements .",
    "the source 3c48 was observed in order to provide an additional flux and polarization calibrator ; the primary flux and polarization calibrator , 3c286 ( wmap",
    "1331 + 305 ) was already part of the sample .",
    "additionally , three much weaker sources from the 9c survey were also observed as a pilot for a future observing programme aimed at much weaker sources .",
    "the nominal time on each source was 37 seconds at 8  ghz , 30 seconds at 22  ghz and 80 seconds at 43  ghz , giving a theoretical rms of 0.2 , 0.5 and 0.7 mjy / beam , respectively , for natural weighting .",
    "however , the rms noise in most images is typically greater than this , being between 1  mjy / beam and 2  mjy / beam in the majority of images .",
    "this is partly due to the use of uniform weighting during the imaging process , which increases the noise level typically by factors between 1.2 and 1.5 .",
    "however , in particular , 8-ghz observations were affected by a combination of missing antennas and slightly longer than predicted slew and setup times on many sources .",
    "a sampling time of 3 seconds per integration was used , the minimum allowed by the observing system .",
    "all data analysis and processing was carried out in the aips package , distributed by the us national radio astronomy observatory .",
    "data were examined and flagged manually .",
    "the 22-ghz data were relatively clean , but extensive flagging of bad telescopes was performed source by source on both 8-ghz and 43-ghz data , resulting in the removal of up to half of the data on any given source .",
    "the major problems were loss of correlation on some telescopes during setup at the beginning of a scan , together with intermittent bad data on many individual telescopes .",
    "overall amplitude calibration was performed using observations of the source 3c286 at each frequency and normalising to the flux scale of baars et al .",
    "amplitude and phase solutions were made using the sources stronger than a limiting flux density ; the process was iterated , adjusting this limiting flux , until the amplitude and phase solutions appeared to vary in a coherent manner .",
    "amplitude solutions were smoothed using an averaging time of 1 hour for 43  ghz and 0.1 hours for the other frequencies . in the case of the 8-ghz observations ,",
    "a further calibration was made , again using a standard model for 3c286 , for baseline - dependent offsets .",
    "this was necessary because of the mixture of receivers in the array , approximately equally distributed between old ( vla ) and new ( evla ) receivers .",
    "polarization calibration was then carried out .",
    "telescope polarization offsets were calibrated by use of the source 3c84 , which was assumed to have zero polarization .",
    "this assumption is correct for the level of accuracy required here : taylor et al .",
    "( 2006 ) report levels of @xmath80.1% polarization in the core of the source at frequencies less than 22 ghz , with approximately 0.2% at 22ghz , and a somewhat higher level ( 0.8 - 7.5% ) in the weak mas - scale jet component .",
    "the overall level of polarization in 3c84 is likely to be about 0.1% .",
    "3c84 was not observed at 8  ghz . in this case",
    "the source 0125@xmath9001 , a bright point source for which no significant polarization was detected in either 22-ghz or 43-ghz observations , was used instead .",
    "the polarization position angle was calibrated by use of the 3c286 data , applying corrections to the r@xmath9l phase difference to rotate the 3c286 polarization position angle to 33@xmath4 .",
    "the baseline - to - baseline scatter in this quantity was 0.6 , 3.3 and 8.5 degrees for 8  ghz , 22  ghz and 43  ghz respectively .",
    "imaging was performed using the aips task imagr with uniform weighting , on a default 128@xmath10128 grid and cellsizes of 18 , 07 and 035 for 8  ghz , 22  ghz and 43  ghz respectively . for strong sources ( roughly speaking , those containing sufficient flux density to have been used as phase calibrators ) , one iteration of phase - only self - calibration and one iteration of amplitude self - calibration",
    "was applied .",
    "final total intensity images were produced using 1000 clean iterations ( hgbom 1974 ) ; images in stokes @xmath11 and @xmath12 were produced using a limited number ( 40 ) of iterations to avoid reduction in the signal due to clean bias ( e.g. condon et al . 1998 ) .",
    "estimation of the stokes @xmath13 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 flux densities was performed in two ways .",
    "the first method consisted of fitting to the calibrated ( @xmath14 ) data , constraining the fit by fixing the position to the peak of the @xmath13 map , constraining the intrinsic size of the peak component to be @xmath15 , but allowing the @xmath11 and @xmath12 flux density to vary .",
    "constraints are necessary to avoid instability in the fits due to noise in the polarization data .",
    "the alternative method consisted of finding , and fitting to , the highest absolute value in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 images , within a square of side 10 pixels .",
    "neither method is ideal .",
    "fitting to the ( @xmath14 ) data has the advantage of independence from effects due to deconvolution , notably the effects of clean bias . on the other hand ,",
    "stabilising the fit requires fixing the peak of the stokes @xmath11 and @xmath12 to the peak of the @xmath13 data , and this may not be appropriate for sources with extended polarized structure .",
    "1 shows a comparison of the two methods , and demonstrates that for the majority of sources the two methods agree well .",
    "approximately 10% of sources show significant disagreement , mostly those with low polarized flux densities . in table 2 , where the data are presented , detailed comments are given in cases where the two methods disagree .",
    "errors given in table 2 are a quadrature combination of the random error , as output by aips , and the systematic calibration error , assumed to be 5% for 43 ghz and 22  ghz and 2% at 8.4  ghz .",
    "because the total polarization is a quadratic sum of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , it is positive - biased ; values of polarized flux density of three times the rms noise can not therefore be regarded as significant detections .",
    "many studies of this effect have been made .",
    "for example , simmons & stewart ( 1985 ) give a relation of estimated signal - to - noise , @xmath16 , and observed signal - to - noise @xmath17 , in polarization for four different indicators .",
    "these all converge towards equality for @xmath18 as @xmath19 , and diverge strongly for @xmath20 , reaching values of @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "the issue in these observations is complicated by the different values of rms noise in different images .",
    "inspection of the images suggests that polarized flux densities of 10mjy are likely to be significant at all frequencies in both methods .",
    "2 shows the complete total intensity and stokes maps , together with the spectrum in total intensity and polarization , for the first source in order of right ascension , wmap  0006@xmath9063 .",
    "the other images can be found in the online material associated with this article .",
    "flux densities of observed sources at x- , k- and q - bands .",
    "fluxes in italics are from class , in the case of multiple observations using that with the lowest error in polarized flux density .",
    "a dagger indicates that the measurement has been taken from the @xmath11 and @xmath12 maps , rather than the fits to the u - v data ( see text for details ) .",
