    "there are two ways of driving a classical nonlinear oscillator by a small oscillating force : via either external or parametric resonance . in both cases , the initial growth of the amplitude of the oscillator",
    "is arrested , even without dissipation , when nonlinear effects come into play .",
    "this is due to the fact that the natural frequency of a nonlinear oscillator is amplitude - dependent , so a mismatch between the ( invariable ) driving frequency and the natural frequency appears @xcite .    to overcome the nonlinear mismatch and",
    "maintain phase locking between the driving force and the oscillator , one can slowly vary the driving frequency with time so as to achieve a persistent growth of the oscillations .",
    "this simple and versatile method is called autoresonance : either external , or parametric . to emphasize the difference between the two ,",
    "let us watch a child on a swing .",
    "when a parent pushes the swing ( once in each cycle ) , he gradually increases the time interval between the pushes as the swing amplitude grows . here",
    "he employs external autoresonance . on the contrary ,",
    "when the child swings himself ( he achieves it by moving the position of his center of mass up and down _ twice _ in each cycle ) , he gradually increases the period of these modulations as the swing amplitude grows .",
    "this is parametric autoresonance .",
    "the simple model of a nonlinear oscillator , excited via external autoresonance , has found numerous applications in physics , see _",

    "@xcite for a brief review .",
    "the external autoresonance scheme has been also generalized to systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom , such as nonlinear waves @xcite and vortices @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the external autoresonance , parametric autoresonance has received much less attention @xcite . in this work",
    "we generalize to nonlinear waves the theory , developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for a nonlinear oscillator .",
    "specifically , we show that the parametric autoresonance mechanism can be used for driving nonlinear standing gravity waves with a steadily growing amplitude on a free surface of a fluid .",
    "michael faraday @xcite was the first to observe that , when a tank containing a fluid is periodically vibrated in the vertical direction , a standing wave pattern forms at the free surface of the fluid when the vibration frequency is twice the frequency of the surface vibrations .",
    "this phenomenon is a classic example of parametric resonance , because the vertical acceleration of the tank - an intrinsic parameter of the system - depends on time via the periodic vibration .",
    "lord rayleigh @xcite carried out a further series of experiments , which supported faraday s observations , and also developed a linear theory for these waves in terms of a linear mathieu equation .",
    "benjamin and ursell @xcite advanced the linear theory further .",
    "subsequently , miles @xcite , douady @xcite , milner @xcite , and decent and craik @xcite formulated a weakly nonlinear theory based on amplitude expansion , while some of these and indeed numerous other works dealt with experimental studies of faraday waves .",
    "being interested in parametric _ autoresonance _ , we add a new dimension to the problem of faraday waves and investigate weakly nonlinear standing gravity waves formed when the vibration frequency is slowly _ decreased _ ( chirped downwards ) in time .",
    "we show that the negative frequency chirp causes a persistent growth of the wave amplitude . like in other instances of autoresonance ,",
    "the exact form of the frequency chirp is unimportant once the chirp sign is correct , and the chirp rate is not too high .",
    "the autoresonance excitation is expected to terminate at large amplitudes , when an underlying dynamical system , corresponding to the case of a _ constant _ frequency , ceases to exhibit a non - trivial stable fixed point .",
