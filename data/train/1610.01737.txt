    "the discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , and its related technologies , was one of the great scientific achievements of the 20th century , contributing to significant advances in areas ranging from materials science to healthcare .",
    "however , the limitation in sensitivity of traditional induction - based detection has required the development of new methods in order to extend nmr technology to the nanoscale , where the study of processes at the molecular scale is of intense interest . the nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centre in diamond @xcite has seen remarkable developments as a high sensitivity nanoscale magnetometer @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the nv centre has been utilised to achieve nanoscale nmr at sensitivities close to that required for single proton detection @xcite .",
    "its room - temperature operation also makes it an ideal candidate for biological nano - nmr @xcite . however , current nmr protocols using the nv centre require the application of complex , high - power and high - precision microwave pulsing sequences in order to filter the environmental spectrum , placing significant constraints on nano - magnetic resonance imaging applications @xcite .",
    "the application of strong microwave pulses is potentially invasive given the attendant electric fields as an inevitable by - product in the generation of the magnetic control fields .",
    "in addition , achieving such quantum control on a large ensemble of nv centres over a wide field of view @xcite , or on a scanning probe microscopy tip @xcite , remains a challenge due to the requirement for homogeneity in the driving field .",
    "finally , the adaptability of such high - precision control to dynamic environments such as in vitro @xcite is unknown .    in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate microwave - free nano - nmr on a nanoscopic sample of proton nuclear spins within an organic sample external to the diamond ( fig . [",
    "we achieve this via static field tuning to the natural spin interactions between sensor and target , and measure a change in the longitudinal relaxation time , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the resulting all - optical microwave - free protocol can be applied in a non - invasive manner ( e.g. , through optical excitation constrained within the diamond using total internal reflection @xcite ) , significantly widening the range of applications where nv - based nano - nmr can be used .",
    "we demonstrate the microwave - free nmr technique using both isotopic forms @xmath3nv and @xmath4nv , which exhibit different fundamental characteristics in this context , and use the data to estimate the nv - sample distance ( @xmath5  nm for the studied nvs ) as well as the number of protons detected ( @xmath6 ) . in addition",

    "the microwave - free technique for magnetic resonance spectroscopy is based on @xmath2 relaxometry detection @xcite and precise magnetic field tuning to bring the nv into resonance with the zeeman split target spin transitions @xcite . this technique was proposed and demonstrated for electron spin resonance spectroscopy using an ensemble of nv centres @xcite and extended to hyperfine - coupled nuclear spin spectroscopy with single nv centres @xcite .",
    "the ultimate goal of nano - nmr is the spectroscopic detection of bare nuclear spins in molecular systems . without the assistance of strong hyperfine coupling",
    "this is a significant challenge due to the low nuclear magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "applying the @xmath2-nmr technique to this problem requires the precise tuning of the nv probe to near its ground state level anti - crossing ( gslac ) , where the system s dynamics are dominated by a relatively complex landscape of electron - nuclear spin mixing @xcite , in order to bring the electronic nv transitions into resonance with the nuclear spin transition . at a resonance point ( which in principle could occur both before and after the gslac as depicted in fig .",
