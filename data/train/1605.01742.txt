    "the aim of this paper is to expose and exploit connections between the following two areas :    1 .",
    "linear representations of discrete groups ; 2 .",
    "differentiable dynamical systems .",
    "more specifically , we show that _ anosov representations _",
    "are closely related to _",
    "dominated splittings_. this relation allows us to reobtain some results about anosov representations , and to give new characterizations of them .",
    "anosov representations where introduced by labourie @xcite in his study of the hitchin component ( @xcite ) .",
    "they provide a stable class of discrete faithful representations of word - hyperbolic groups into semi - simple lie groups , that unifies examples of varying nature .",
    "since then , anosov representations have become a main object of study , being subject of various deep results ( see for example @xcite , the surveys @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , new characterizations of anosov representations have been found by @xcite , these characterizations considerably simplify the definition .",
    "it is now fairly accepted in the community that anosov representations are a good generalization of convex co - compact groups to higher rank .    in differentiable dynamical systems , the notion of _ hyperbolicity _ , as introduced by anosov and smale @xcite plays a central role .",
    "early on , it was noted that weaker forms of hyperbolicity ( partial , nonuniform , etc . ) should also be studied : see @xcite for a detailed account .",
    "one of these is the the notion of _ dominated splittings _ , which can be thought as a projective version of hyperbolicity : see section  [ s.ds ] .    as mentioned above , in this paper",
    "we benefit from the viewpoint of differentiable dynamics in the study of linear representations .",
    "for example , it turns out that a linear representation is anosov if and only if its associated linear flow has a dominated splitting : see subsection  [ ss.equivalences ] for the precise statements .",
    "let us summarize the contents of this paper .    in section  [ s.ds ]",
    "we describe the basic facts about dominated splittings that will be used in the rest of the paper .",
    "we present the characterization of dominated splittings given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  a ) .",
    "we rely on this theorem in different contexts throughout the paper .",
    "in section  [ s.dominationimplieshyp ] we introduce _ dominated representations",
    "_ @xmath0 of a given finitely generated group @xmath1 into @xmath2 .",
    "the definition is simple : we require the gap between some consecutive singular values to be exponentially large with respect to the word length of the group element , that is , @xmath3 for some constants @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "we show that the existence of such a domination representation implies that the group @xmath1 is word - hyperbolic : see theorem  [ teo : dominationimplieshyp ] .",
    "word - hyperbolicity allows us to consider anosov representations , and in section  [ sec - equiv ] we show that they are exactly the same as dominated representations",
    ". many of the results in sections [ s.dominationimplieshyp ] and [ sec - equiv ] are not new , appearing in the recent works of @xcite and @xcite with different terminology .",
    "our proofs are different and make use of the formalism of linear cocycles and most importantly of non - trivial properties of dominated splittings . at the end of section  [ sec - equiv ]",
    "we pose a few questions where the connection with differentiable dynamics is manifest .    in section  [ s.multicones ]",
    "we give yet another equivalent condition for a representation to be anosov , which uses the sofic subshift generated by the cone - types instead of the geodesic flow of the group : see theorem  [ t.multicone_representation ] .",
    "this condition is very much inspired in @xcite and provides nice ways to understand the variation of the limit maps , as well as a quite direct method to check if a representation is dominated .",
    "this criterion is used in section  [ sec - analytic ] to reobtain a basic result from @xcite on the analyticity of the limit maps for an anosov representation : see theorem  [ teo.analytic ] .",
    "section [ ss.morse ] shows how ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  a ) implies a morse  lemma - type statement for the symmetric space of @xmath7 . that result",
    "is contained in the recent work of @xcite , but we provide here a different approach .",
    "this section only relies on section [ s.ds ] .    in section  [ sec - general ]",
    "we replace @xmath2 with a real - algebraic non - compact semi - simple lie group .",
    "representation theory of such groups allows one to reduce most of the general statement to the corresponding ones in @xmath2 .",
    "this is a fairly standard procedure and provides straightforward generalizations of the results of sections  [ s.dominationimplieshyp ] through [ sec - analytic ] .",
    "nevertheless , more work is needed to obtain a morse lemma for symmetric spaces of non - compact type , and this occupies most of section  [ sec - general ] .",
