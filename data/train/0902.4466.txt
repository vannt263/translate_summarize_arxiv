    "the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) field can be studied in terms of the parity even e and parity odd b - modes  @xcite . in standard cosmology ,",
    "the physics governing the radiating field is parity invariant .",
    "hence , the parity odd correlations @xmath14 , @xmath15 vanish identically irrespective of the exact values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "however , the plane of linear polarization of cmb fields can be rotated due to interactions which introduce a different dispersion relation for the left and right circularly polarized modes , during propagation from the surface of last scattering surface to the earth .",
    "such rotations generate non - zero cross - correlations @xmath14 , @xmath15 in the cmb field .",
    "thus , measurement of these correlations allows us to estimate the rotation of the plane of the cmb polarization  @xcite .",
    "such interactions can come from three main sources : ( a ) interaction with dust foregrounds , ( b ) faraday rotation due to interaction with background magnetic fields , and ( c ) interactions with pseudoscalar fields  @xcite .",
    "the interaction with foregrounds leads to a a frequency dependent effect .",
    "the same is true of faraday rotation , where the frequency dependence is ( @xmath16 )  @xcite , while the interaction with pseudo - scalar fields is frequency independent .",
    "the distinct frequency dependencies allow one to separate these effects .    we know that parity is violated by weak interactions , and is possibly violated in the early universe , to give rise to baryon asymmetry .",
    "hence , investigating the existence of parity violating interactions involving cosmologically evolving scalar fields is well motivated . as an example we consider an interaction of the form @xmath17",
    "it has been shown that such a term can rotate polarization vector of linearly polarized light by an angle of rotation @xmath18 during propagation for a conformal time @xmath19 .",
    "the fluctuations in the scalar field @xmath20 then will be imprinted in the rotation angle @xmath21 of the polarization .",
    "it is interesting to ask what is the level of these fluctuations that can be detected with the upcoming cmb polarization experiments .",
    "however , the observational situation is somewhat complicated by the fact that the measured cmb fields could be rotated with respect to the signal due to instrumental systematics : a mis - calibration of the orientation of the instrument which results in a constant rotation and differential offsets of the orientation of the individual detectors of the instrument resulting in rotation dependent on angular position @xmath22 .",
    "it should be noted that this systematic effect is also a concern for the detection of polarization b modes , a major goal for forthcoming polarization experiments , since it can result in a spurious b - mode detection .",

    "we use this to construct approximate , but simpler form of the quadratic estimator of @xmath24 using the flat - sky limit , and study its variance .",
    "these estimators may be used to study the physics behind the rotation of the polarization of light . as we shall discuss",

    "so far , there is no evidence of non - zero angle of rotation , and the angle @xmath21 is constrained to be less than a few degrees  @xcite . at present",

    "in this section , we will construct an estimator for the spatially varying rotation field .",

    "we will describe the observable effect of rotation on the cmb polarization fields .",
    "let the un - rotated ( usual ) cmb temperature field and the stokes parameters at angular position @xmath22 be @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 respectively .",
    "the relevant ensemble averages of the un - rotated cmb field can be encapsulated in @xmath30 where @xmath31 run over the @xmath32 , or @xmath2 fields , and @xmath33 is the un - rotated cmb power spectrum .",
    "the temperature fields are invariant under a rotation of the polarization by an angle @xmath24 at the angular position @xmath22 , while the stokes parameters transform like a spin two field .",

    "dot - dashed blue curves represent the level of rotation systematics to which our estimator can be used to correct for ; i.e. if the systematics , @xmath203 are above the blue curve then our estimator can reduce it to the level given by blue curve . if the instrumental systematics parameter @xmath203 are above the red curve , our estimator is no longer a minimum variance estimator , and one should include the systematics noise effect @xmath204 in the variance of our estimator . however if instrumental systematics parameter @xmath203 are below the red curve , then for a given @xmath198 if the systematics requirement for b - mode is less stringent that the requirement from rotation , one can use our estimator to control the rotation systematics for b - modes detection .",
    "if the systematics parameters @xmath203 are below the dot - dashed blue curve , then the rotation from the systematics is smaller than the sensitivity of the estimator . if our estimator detects rotation signal in this case then it can be attributed to cosmological signal or to incorrectness of the systematics model .",

    "the physical mechanisms that give rise to the rotation field all probe interesting cosmological physics ; in principle , they can be separated using their frequency dependence and used to study the magnetic field or polarization dust maps . a cosmological source for a frequency",
    "independent pure rotation field can be interpreted as exotic feature signifying a clear departure from standard model physics .",
    "such a departure could be a violation of the equivalence principle , or violation of lorentz invariance  @xcite . in the context of cosmology ,",
    "an important example is pseudoscalar fields which have been proposed as dynamical models of dark energy to solve the cosmological constant problem , dark matter , and also as a solution to the fine tuning problem of dark energy .",

    "the spatially varying part of this rotation field would also probe the clustering of such a field .",
    "typically , such fields would have large sound speeds , so that clustering is only possible at large scales .",
    "hence , the possibility of detection of the spatially varying field is best at low multipoles .",
    "if one assumes that the field has the kind of clustering discussed in  @xcite , then from an experiment like cmbpol , one can constrain the mass scale of suppression of the chern - simons coupling term , to @xmath208 gev .    however , the rotation field induced by a cosmological source can be degenerate with the rotation systematics of the instrument , which are limited by the rotation calibration of the polarimeters .",
    "thus , the detection of such cosmological signals is only possible if the cosmological signal is larger than the level of rotation systematics signal that can be controlled .",
    "rotation systematics also effect the variance of our estimator .",
    "we quantify the level of systematics control required for detection of the cosmological signal to be only limited by the estimator noise @xmath3 .",
    "if one can show from other experiments that the sources of such cosmological signals can be limited to magnitudes @xmath209 smaller than these systematic levels , then we can not detect the cosmological signals .",
    "however , then we can use this fact that the observed rotation field should be less than this magnitude to calibrate the instrument to control the level of rotation systematics to precision levels of @xmath210 .",
    "this could enable a better study of effects like primordial b - modes , lensing , or the frequency dependent signals from sources like magnetic fields or foreground dust .",
    "thus precise studies of this rotation field could either probe exciting physical effects , and/or enable better control of calibration and instrumental statistics .",
