    "in what follows @xmath1 will denote completely separable baire vector spaces over the field @xmath2 and @xmath3 will be a bounded linear operator on @xmath1 . since the last 1980 s , density properties of orbits of operators have been of great interest for many mathematicians , particularly hypercyclic and cyclic operators for their link with the invariant subspace problem .",
    "another reason explaining this interest is that they appear in many well - known classes of operators : weighted shifts , composition operators , translation operators , ...    a vector @xmath4 is said to be hypercyclic ( resp .",
    "supercyclic ) for @xmath3 if its orbit @xmath5 ( resp .",
    "projective orbit @xmath6 ) is dense in @xmath1 .",
    "the operator @xmath3 is said to be hypercyclic ( resp .",
    "supercyclic ) if it admits at least one hypercyclic ( resp .",
    "supercyclic ) vector .",
    "one may remove linearity in this definition , then under the same assumptions , @xmath3 is said to be universal .",
    "the definition of supercyclicity was introduced in 1974 by hilden and wallen @xcite .",
    "as one can see , this notion does not deal with orbits of vectors any more but with orbits of lines .",
    "as we said before , these properties have been intensively studied and the reader may refer to @xcite and @xcite for a deep and complete survey .",
    "one of the main ingredient providing such operators is the so called supercyclicity criterion given by h.n .",
    "salas @xcite , which is only a sufficient condition for supercyclicity .",
    "let @xmath1 be a separable banach space and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath3 satisfies the supercyclicity criterion if there exist a strictly increasing sequence @xmath8 , two dense sets @xmath9 in @xmath1 and a sequence of maps @xmath10 such that :    a.   @xmath11 for any @xmath12 and @xmath13;[scrit1 ] b.   @xmath14 for any @xmath13.[scrit2 ]    if @xmath3 satisfies the supercyclicity criterion , then @xmath3 is supercyclic .",
    "this result is at the very heart of the theory .",
    "indeed , only very few operators have been proved to be supercyclic without using this criterion .",
    "recently , some authors tried to generalise supercyclicity in a natural way .",
    "the first one is n. feldman @xcite at the beginning of the 2000 s .",
    "an operator @xmath3 is said to be @xmath0-supercyclic , @xmath15 , if there is a subspace of dimension @xmath0 in @xmath1 with dense orbit .",
    "these operators have been studied in @xcite,@xcite and @xcite and @xcite and many other articles .",
    "feldman gave various classes of @xmath0-supercyclic operators and in particular the following :    [ exefelnsupop]@xcite let @xmath16 . if @xmath17 is a collection of open disks , @xmath18 on @xmath19 for any @xmath20 and @xmath21 , then @xmath22 is @xmath0-supercyclic .",
    "then , in 2004 , bourdon , feldman and shapiro @xcite proved in the complex setting that @xmath0-supercyclicity is a purely infinite dimensional phenomenon .",
    "[ theoboufelshap ] let @xmath23 .",
    "there is no @xmath24-supercyclic operator on @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , there is no @xmath26-supercyclic operator on @xmath25 for any @xmath27 .",
    "recently , the present author @xcite proved that things were different in the real setting .",
    "these theorems recall the behaviour of supercyclic operators in finite dimensional vector spaces .",
    "nevertheless , even though most of the supercyclic theorems have a @xmath0-supercyclic counterpart , some questions remain open .",
    "in particular , one may ask whether there exist a birkhoff theorem , a @xmath0-supercyclicity criterion or even if the ansari theorem remains true for @xmath0-supercyclic operators .",
    "these questions are `` more difficult '' than the previous ones mainly because @xmath1 being a vector space , we are not considering a  natural space  for working on orbits of @xmath0-dimensional subspaces . in this spirit , in 2008 , shkarin @xcite proposed the concept of strong @xmath0-supercyclicity requiring a stronger condition as its name suggests .",
    "let us first recall some well - known facts before coming to the definition of strong @xmath0-supercyclicity .",
    "if @xmath1 has dimension greater than @xmath28 , then one may define a topology on the @xmath0-th grassmannian , denoted by @xmath29 , which is the set of all @xmath0-dimensional subspaces of @xmath1 .",
    "to do so , set @xmath30 the open set of all linearly independent @xmath0-tuples @xmath31 and endow @xmath30 with the topology induced by @xmath32 . then set @xmath33 , @xmath34 and define the topology on @xmath29 as being the coarsest for which @xmath35 is continuous and open .",
    "now , let us move to the awaited definition :    let @xmath28 .",
    "an @xmath0-dimensional subspace of @xmath1 is said to be strongly @xmath0-supercyclic for @xmath3 if for every @xmath36 , @xmath37 has dimension @xmath0 and if its orbit @xmath38 is dense in @xmath29 .",
    "the set of all strongly @xmath0-supercyclic subspaces for @xmath3 is denoted @xmath39 .",
    "the bounded linear operator @xmath3 is called strongly @xmath0-supercyclic if @xmath40 .    in this definition and all along this paper , we make no difference between @xmath41 as a subspace of @xmath1 and @xmath41 as an element of @xmath29 .",
    "the main interest of this definition , compared to feldman s one , is that it reduces to the universality of @xmath3 on the space @xmath29 . from this point of view",
    ", the definition of strongly @xmath0-supercyclic operators seems quite natural .",
    "moreover , with this observation shkarin @xcite proved that strongly @xmath0-supercyclic operators do satisfy the ansari property :    let @xmath42 .",
    "then @xmath43 . in particular",
    ", @xmath3 is strongly @xmath0-supercyclic if and only if @xmath44 is strongly @xmath0-supercyclic .",
    "when he introduced the previous definition , shkarin asked the question whether @xmath0-supercyclicity is equivalent to strong @xmath0-supercyclicity .",
    "indeed , a positive answer to this question solve the ansari property problem for @xmath0-supercyclic operators .",
    "in fact , the present author gave a negative answer to this question in @xcite and we will construct some more counterexamples in the present paper . since , @xcite is very concise on strong @xmath0-supercyclicity , giving only the definition and the ansari property and @xcite is only concerned with the finite dimensional setting , the aim of this paper is to present a deeper study of strong @xmath0-supercyclicity .",
    "a useful theorem in linear dynamics is birkhoff s transitivity theorem because it permits to consider the  orbit of an open set  instead of the orbit of a point and is the key point to prove the hypercyclicity and supercyclicity criteria .",
    "this property is called topological transitivity .",
    "such a result would be a stable anchor for studying strongly @xmath0-supercyclic operators and this is the purpose of this section . but",
