    "the increasing number of space telescopes and space probes that provide information about phenomena occurring in the space is yielding enormous amount of data that need to be analyzed to get information about the physical processes taking place .",
    "in particular , images of the sun obtained from the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) instruments and the new interface region imaging spectrograph ( iris ) mission have a remarkable high resolution that allow studies of the sun with great detail , not available before .",
    "the analysis of the images usually involves some processing if one is to extract information not readily obtained from the raw images .",
    "some techniques used for image analysis and feature recognition in the sun have been described by @xcite .",
    "a useful tool that gives information about the physical conditions in the emitting region is the emission measure ( em ) which is obtained from images in several wavelengths ; this in turn provides the local temperature of the emitting region ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "when the em is computed for all the pixels in a given region of the sun , the temperature maps can be obtained .",
    "there are some computational tools developed in solarsoftware ( ssw ) that take images from different instruments at the available filters to produce em and temperature maps ( e.g. for yohkoh , soho , trace , sdo ) .",
    "the images can be processed for pattern recognition using techniques such as wavelet analysis that sort the structures in terms of the scaling properties of their size distribution @xcite .",
    "another method , which is also frequently used in image compression , is the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the pixel matrix .",
    "this method is the basis of the more general proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) which has been applied in many contexts including : _ solar physics _",

    "@xcite ; and _ turbulence models _ @xcite .",
    "application to plasma physics relevant to the present work include compression of magnetohydrodynamics data @xcite ; detection of coherent structures @xcite , and multi - scale analysis of plasma turbulence @xcite . in this work",
    "we apply pod techniques to a time sequence of images representing solar temperature maps .",
    "the specific method , referred to as topos - chronos @xcite , is used to perform spatio - temporal multi - scale analysis of different solar regions .",
    "of particular interest is the analysis of solar flare activity . to this end",
    "we perform an analysis of temperature maps corresponding to a region of solar flare activity , and compare the results with the analysis done in the _ same _ region _ before _ the solar flare and in a  quiet \" region where no flares were detected during the time of observation .",
    "our pod multi - scale analysis is accompanied with a statistical analysis of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of temperature fluctuations . in particular , in the search for statistical precursors of solar flare activity ,",
    "we show that the small scale temperature fluctuations in pre - flare states exhibit broader variability ( compared to the flare and quiet sun states ) and the corresponding pdfs exhibit non - gaussian stretched - exponential tails characteristic of intermittency .",
    "we also present a study heat transport during solar flare activity based on a simplified analysis that allows to infer the transport coefficients ( advection velocity and diffusivity profiles ) from the data .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ s : dpod ] the fundamentals of pod methods are presented and the features of the topos - chronos method as the optimal representation of a truncated matrix are explained .",
    "section [ s:3 ] describes how the data for temperature maps are obtained for a solar flare event and for other solar regions .",
    "the results of applying the pod methods to the data are described in section [ s:4 ] highlighting the statistical features of the multi - scale analysis .",
    "this leads to the identification of intermittency in an active region previous to a flare . as a further application , section [ s : heat ] presents the evaluation of heat transport coefficients based on the full temperature maps and on pod . finally , in section [ s : con ] we give the conclusions of the analysis and an appraisal of the pod methods applied to solar physics .",
    "in this section we review the basic ideas of the pod method and its application in separating spatial and temporal information as used in the present work .",
    "the singular value decomposition ( svd ) is , generally speaking , a mathematical method based on matrix algebra that allows to construct a basis in which the data is optimally represented .",
    "it is a powerful tool because it helps extract dominant features and coherent structures that might be hidden in the data by identifying and sorting the dimensions along which the data exhibits greater variation .",
    "the svd of the matrix @xmath0 is a factorization of the form , @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are orthogonal matrices ( i.e. * @xmath4 * ) and @xmath5 is a rectangular diagonal matrix with positive diagonal entries .",
    "the @xmath6 diagonal entries of @xmath7 are usually denoted by @xmath8 for @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath8 are called singular values of a. the singular values are the square roots of the non - zero eigenvalues of both @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and they satisfy the property @xmath13.@xcite    another useful mathematical expression of svd is through the tensor product .",
    "the svd of a matrix can be seen as an ordered and weighted sum of rank-1 separable matrices . by this",
    "we mean that the matrix @xmath14 can be written as the external tensor product of two vectors : @xmath15 or by its components : @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 where @xmath18 . here *",
    "@xmath19 * and * @xmath20 * are the i - th columns of u and v respectively . equation ( [ rango ] ) is convenient when one wants to approximate @xmath14 using a matrix of lower rank . in particular , according to the eckart - young theorem @xcite , given eq .",

    "since the svd analysis applies to 2d matrices , the first step is to represent the 3d array as a 2d matrix .",
    "this can be achieved by `` unfolding '' the 2d spatial domain of the data into a 1d vector , i. e. @xmath43 with @xmath44 , and representing the spatio - temporal data as the @xmath45 matrix @xmath46 , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "active region 11562 was the originator of the solar flare of goes - class c8.4 .",
    "the aia instrument consists of four detectors with a resolution of @xmath63 pixels , where the pixel size corresponds to a space scale of @xmath64 ( @xmath65 km ) .",
    "it also contains ten different wavelengths channels , three of them in white light and uv , and seven in euv , whereof six wavelengths ( 131 , 171 , 193 , 211 , 335 , 94  ) are centered on strong iron lines ( fe viii , ix , xii , xiv , xvi , xviii ) , covering the coronal range from @xmath66 mk to @xmath67mk .",

    "more detailed instrument descriptions can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    for each wavelength",
    "there is a corresponding temperature ( @xmath68 ) for the emitting region , so the images of the different intensities , @xmath69 ) , can be used to obtain maps of the coronal temperature .",
    "these intensities represent the measured photon flux , which is determined by both the physical conditions in the emission region and the filter response .",
    "the former is usually represented by the so - called _ differential emission measure _ ( dem ) which is used to obtain the temperature distribution of the plasma averaged along the line of sight .        the dem distribution [ @xmath70 is typically given by @xmath71 [ @xmath72 k@xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the electron density at height @xmath75 and with temperature @xmath76 .",
    "the dem distribution dem@xmath77/dt$ ] can be reconstructed from the six filter fluxes [ @xmath78 , but @xcite developed a method to compute the peak emission measure ( em ) and the peak temperature @xmath79 for each pixel based on a simple representation of the dem by a gaussian function of temperature , for each filter .",
    "then , model fluxes are computed from the expression @xmath80 where @xmath81 are the filter response functions at a given wavelength , which are fitted to the observed flux @xmath82 .",

    "the temperature map covers a temperature interval in the range @xmath83 shown in the vertical bar .",

    "we first focus on the heat front that propagates from left to right in the region close to the flare site . from these maps",
    "we can extract information concerning : ( 1 ) the nature of the heat transport and ( 2 ) the physical conditions in the region .",
    "in particular , we seek to obtain information from the analysis about the energy distribution in the different spatial scales and how this compares with other regions with no flares .",

    "the pod method can be applied in a systematic way to separate time and space features and study them with a multi - scale analysis , or to determine the underlying features of heat transport .",

    "[ interv ] is also applied to two other temperature maps corresponding to ( a ) exactly the same physical region but about one hour before the appearance of the flare ( to which we refer as _ pre - flare _ ) and ( b ) a different region in the quiet sun for the same time interval as the first map ( referred to as _ quiet - sun _ or qs ) .",
    "these other analyses are made in order to compare the properties of the three cases and be able to determine the features associated with flare activity in the solar corona .      as mentioned in subsection [ tc ]",
    ", the pod represents the data as a superposition of separable space - time modes .",
    "figures [ top ] , [ top2 ] and [ top3 ] show the result of applying this process to the three cases mentioned : during solar flare , pre - flare and quiet sun , respectively .",
    "the figures include behavior for small ranks , @xmath87 and large ranks , @xmath88 .",
    "the 2d plots in the first and third columns present the spatial distribution , topos modes @xmath89 , rescaled by the singular values @xmath90 .",
    "the second and fourth columns show the chronos pod modes @xmath91 .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ top2 ] for the flare time , that low-@xmath92 chronos modes exhibit a low frequency variation while large-@xmath92 modes exhibit high frequency burst activity . however , if we plot the absolute value of the chronos mode as function of the indices @xmath93 and @xmath92 there is no evident regularity or periodicity found that may indicate some kind of cascade process .",
    "a similar behavior is found for the topos modes in which large scale structures are seen for low @xmath92 while a granulated structure with small scales is found for high @xmath92 .",
    "thus , there is some correlation between small scales and high frequencies for high @xmath92 modes and large scales and low frequencies for low @xmath92 modes .",
    "this correlation can be further studied using fourier analysis to extract the characteristic spatiotemporal scales of each pod mode . for the topos modes ,",

    "the characteristic length scale of the topos rank-@xmath92 mode is then defined as the mean length scale of the corresponding fourier spectrum , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is defined as : @xmath100 using the same procedure , we associate a characteristic time scale @xmath101 to each chronos @xmath102 mode using @xmath103 with : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the fourier transform in time of @xmath102 .",
    "figure [ fouflare ] shows the characteristic length scale @xmath106 versus the characteristic time scale @xmath107 for all ranks .",
    "the tendency for increasing time scale with increasing space scales is apparent , although there is some dispersion for small space - time scales .",
    "this means that there is some sort of cascading where heat is transfered from large to small spatio - temporal scales .",
    "this is similar to the cascading process of turbulent systems ( e.g. futatani et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "the scaling can be fitted by a power law of the type @xmath108 and in this case @xmath109 . for a diffusive - like process @xmath110 ,",
    "thus this results suggests that a sub - diffusive heat transfer may be taking place .",
    "the topos - chronos plots for the pre - flare and quiet - sun cases in figs .",
    "[ top2 ] and [ top3 ] do not show a clear correlation of the time and space scales .",
    "one can notice that only for rank 1 there are dominant large spatial scales while for higher ranks there are only small scales present . in the chronos diagrams the dominant small frequencies seen at low @xmath92 have higher frequency oscillations superimposed .",
    "in order to determine if there is any correlation between spatio - temporal scales we make the same fourier analysis as for the case with flare .",
    "the resulting length and time scales for all ranks are shown in figure  [ foupreqs ] for the two regions , pre - flare and qs .",
    "it is clear that for these cases no correlation is found and thus , it is not possible to attribute any cascading - like process , as in the region affected by the flare .",
    "( a ) ( b )    further information can be obtained from the reconstruction error in the pod representation , defined as the difference @xmath111 where @xmath76 is the original temperature map at a given time @xmath112 , and @xmath113 is the reconstructed map up to rank-@xmath57 at the same time @xmath112 . since a measure of the total energy content in the data is given by @xmath114 , the energy contained in the reconstruction to rank-@xmath57 is @xmath115 with @xmath116 giving the partial energy contribution of the _ _ k__th - mode .",
    "thus , the reconstruction error @xmath117 contains the remaining energy in the leftover ranks @xmath118 . in particular , for high @xmath57 , @xmath119 is associated with the energy in the small scales .",
    "given that the singular values , satisfying @xmath120 , decay very fast in the first few modes , as seen in the pod spectra of figure  [ enrgysingu](a ) for the three cases analyzed , most of the energy is contained in the low-@xmath57 reconstructions .",
    "to see this , figure [ enrgysingu](b ) shows the energy contribution percentage , @xmath121 , as a function of the reconstruction rank-@xmath57 for the three cases under study .",
    "it is clear that the first mode already contains about two thirds of the energy and successive modes contribute less as the rank rises .",
    "the case with the flare has the energy distributed over more modes , reflecting the effect of the large scale flows produced by the flare .     as a function of @xmath92 .",

    "the resulting histogram represents the pdf of @xmath122 and this can be done for different percentages of the energy contribution , i.e. taking the corresponding rank @xmath57 from fig .",
    "[ enrgysingu](b ) .",
    "we chose to use two energy fractions to compare them , namely a residual energy of 10@xmath123 and 25@xmath123 ( i.e. @xmath124 ) .",
    "for each case , there is one pdf for each time @xmath112 having its own height and width , but we expect them to have similar statistical features . thus , as it is customary , we rescale the pdf as @xmath125 and @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the standard deviation . since @xmath127 changes with the different time frames , it is more convenient to use the average @xmath128 over all times in order to have a single normalizing parameter .",
    "thus , for every time the pdfs were rescaled with the average standard deviation as @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "it is found that the resulting rescaled pdfs are all quite similar having a small overall dispersion .",
    "then we took the average over the time sequence of pdfs ( 47 frames ) in order to have a single pdf that represents the statistical properties of the reconstruction error maps for each energy content .",
    "the results for the two energy percentages are shown in figure [ pdfs ] .",
    "it is observed that the pdfs of the pre - flare region are significantly broader than the other two , indicating the presence of very large temperature fluctuations .    in order to determine",
    "if the pdfs have non standard features like long tails , it is useful to fit some known function to the data .",
    "normal statistics produce a gaussian pdf , so we can fit a stretched exponential @xmath131 to the average pdfs in order to asses how far they are from a gaussian ( @xmath132 ) . in figure  [ fits10 ]",
    "we show the best fits to each of the six cases analyzed . for each pdf",
    "we present a fit of the central part and another fit of the tails ( with smaller @xmath133 ) .",
    "clear differences are observed among the flare , pre - flare and qs cases .",
    "however , for the different energy contents , the results do not show great variability .",
    "the interesting result is that pre - flare pdfs , in addition to being the broadest of the three ( see fig .  [ pdfs ] ) , have the lowest values of @xmath133 and so they are the ones that depart the most from a gaussian ; the long tails indicate there is intermittency , i.e. a relatively large number of intense temperature fluctuations . on the other hand , the pdfs for the flare have larger @xmath133 and",
    "thus are closer to a gaussian ; large fluctuation events are then less frequent .",
    "our results agree with the study in @xcite that observed lower levels of intermittency in the presence of sources .",
    "the work in @xcite followed the transport of impurities in a plasma with decaying turbulence ( without sources to sustain it ) finding evidence of intermittency , but it disappears when there are sources that maintain the turbulence . in our case , the flare plays the role of a source that suppresses intermittency . as expected of a region with no solar activity , in the quiet sun case , the pdf does not exhibit long tails , i.e. , the probability of large temperature fluctuations is small .",

    "this separation is amenable to compute the dominant spatial temperature gradients , that drive the heat fluxes , and the time variation of the thermal energy , independently .    substituting the representation for the temperature maps in eq .",
    "[ svdtc ] into eq.([qxorig ] ) we obtain the topos - chronos decomposition of the heat flux profile : @xmath174 the time derivative as well as the time average affect only the temporal modes ; the integral and the average in @xmath28 affect only the spatial modes .",
    "when the space components @xmath175 are transformed back to a 2d array using the coordinate transformation @xmath176 , we obtain the matrix @xmath177 .",
    "each mode of the heat flux is thus given by @xmath178 the heat flux profiles for the first four modes are shown in figure  [ heatmodes ] . as expected , the dominant mode @xmath179 has a profile similar to that of the raw temperature maps in fig .",
    "[ tghflxraw ] . for the other ranks the flux is smaller but , interestingly , for @xmath180 ,",
    "@xmath181 is negative , indicating there is a second order return heat flow .",
    "a similar analysis can be made for the @xmath179 mode .",
    "the result is presented in figure  [ tghk1 ] where , as before , a correlation between @xmath166 and @xmath165 is observed , but not between @xmath166 and the temperature gradient .",
    "thus , advection is again the dominant mechanism and the advection velocity can be computed in the same way .",
    "the resulting velocity profile is shown in figure  [ vels ] together with the velocity obtained from the original maps for comparison .",
    "the topos - chronos velocity is larger in most of the region because it lacks the contributions from higher modes , especially the negative @xmath180 rank .",
    "this shows that keeping just the lowest mode can give incomplete information .",
    "higher modes could also provide information about the small scale diffusive transport . however , an analysis like the one presented in fig .  [ diffprof ] does not allow computing the diffusivity since , as before , it turns out to be negative at some points .",
    "this is because taking the average over the @xmath28 direction is not a good procedure since the contribution of small scales is washed out and this is important for higher modes .     for four values of the rank _",

    "temperature maps obtained from sdo / aia euv images corresponding to a solar event near an ar in the solar corona were analyzed using pod methods and were compared with similar analyses of other maps , one of the same region but before the flare ( pre - flare ) and another of a quiet region during the same time period ( quiet sun ) .",
    "the pod method separates time and space information ( topos - chronos ) thus allowing to determine the dominant space - time scales .",
    "the high - rank modes in the decomposition correspond to smaller spatial scales and in some degree with small time - scales .",
    "an interesting finding is that there is a rough correlation between fourier time and spatial scales when the flare has occurred but not for pre - flare or qs states .",
    "this may indicate that flare - driven large scale heat flows tend to decay into smaller scales , in a cascade - like process .",
    "the topos - chronos method was also used to study the statistical properties of the temperature fluctuations . in particular , we reconstructed the temperature maps up to a certain rank , associated with a given energy content .",
    "the reconstruction error was thus associated with the small - scale temperature fluctuations .",
    "the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of these small - scale fluctuations were obtained for all times and then averaged in time for each of the three regions analyzed .",
    "one of the main results of the present paper is the observation that the pdf for the pre - flare state is significantly broader and has longer tails than the pdfs of the flare and quiet sun cases .",
    "the pre - flare activity seems to produce larger low - amplitude temperature fluctuations , characteristic of intermittency , which might herald the occurrence of the flare .",
    "a multi - scale analysis of the heat flux was also performed for the region associated with the flare .",
    "the thermal flux profiles along the main ( @xmath27 ) direction of the flow were computed using the original temperature maps and compared with the temperature variation along @xmath27 , allowing to obtain the advection velocity profile .",
    "diffusive transport is found to be not relevant .",
    "the same computations were applied for the topos - chronos decomposition finding also a prevalence of advection with a @xmath182 profile for the lowest mode that agrees with the one for the original maps .",
    "higher modes are not so relevant for the advective flux but can provide information about small scale diffusion .    * acknowledgements . * we thank dr .",
