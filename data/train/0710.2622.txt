    "four decades ago @xcite discussed the prospects of identifying ` primeval ' galaxies ( i.e. galaxies forming their first generation of stars ) , using both the lyman decrement and lyman - alpha ( ) emission line as observational tracers .",
    "both methods rely upon the galaxies hosting numerous young , massive stars producing a strong radiation field in the far ultraviolet ( uv ) . the absorption of this radiation field bluewards of the lyman absorption edge results in the lyman - break phenomenon , while the reprocessing of the absorbed photons in astrophysical nebulae results in the superimposition of strong hydrogen recombination lines on the galaxy spectra . while it s likely that both features are present in the spectra of high - redshift ( @xmath0 ) starbursts , from a survey perspective they compete .",
    "lyman - break candidates are identified in multi - broadband imaging surveys where large ranges in redshift ( and therefore cosmic volume ) can be probed , but are biased towards the detection of galaxies with fuv continua towards the brighter end of the luminosity function ( lf )  less numerous in the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario . on the other hand , because emission lines concentrate a large amount of energy in a very small spectral region , sources with much fainter continuum can be uncovered .",
    "unfortunately , isolation of a line requires either a spectroscopic surveys which typically probe narrow fields of view because of the slit dramatically reducing the size in one dimension , or narrowband imaging which probes only a small range in redshift .",
    "the advent of large diameter reflectors , efficient optics , and sensitive photometric devices has resulted in both techniques enjoying much success in recent years .",
    "young galaxies with low dust contents can be expected to produce  emission with high equivalent widths ( ) , @xmath3  for solar - like metallicities ( @xmath4 ) and standard initial mass functions ( imf ) @xcite .",
    "this value is predicted to increase significantly as metallicities approach the population iii domain @xcite .",
    "since the  rest wavelength lies in the fuv , the line is still observable from the ground in the optical domain at @xmath5 and beyond making it , in principle , the ideal tool by which to identify star - forming galaxies in the early universe . despite a rocky start @xcite  emitters ( laes )",
    "are showing up en masse in high-@xmath0 surveys and perhaps their observed and predicted number - densities are now converging @xcite .",
    "is now being used to put constraints on the final stages of cosmic reionisation @xcite and explore high - redshift large scale structure and galaxy clustering @xcite .",
    "in addition , numerous sources have been detected through narrowband imaging techniques with very high @xcite , perhaps indicative of top heavy imfs or extreme stars , making such targets ideal to search for signatures of the so - far illusive population iii stars .",
    "however , so far spectroscopic observations have failed to detect the strong heii@xmath6  feature expected from pop iii objects ( eg .",
    "finally ,  is also being used to estimate the cosmic star formation rate density at the highest redshifts @xcite .",
    "such star formation rates ( sfr ) are typically estimated assuming case b recombination @xcite and the  sfr calibration of @xcite , although the large spread in sfr ( ) _ vs. _ sfr(fuv ) and consistent underestimates from sfr ( ) ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) suggest that such a calibration should be used with caution .",
    "this caution must be extended to all cosmological studies in light of the fact that only a fraction of uv - selected high-@xmath0 targets show a feature in emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the complexities of using  as a cosmological tool result from the fact that it is a resonant line , and its potential cosmological importance",
    "has motivated a number of studies of star - forming galaxies at low-@xmath0 and theoretical models of resonant line radiative transfer .",
    "early studies with the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ initially mirrored the first results at high-@xmath0 :  was typically weak or absent in local starbursts .",
    "this systematic weakening of  was first attributed to dust absorption ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) and an anticorrelation between  and metallicity was found in the _ iue _ sample @xcite .",
    "however , the damped  absorption seen in some local starbursts , and the failure of dust corrections to reconcile  with the fluxes predicted by recombination theory @xcite , is indicative of selective attenuation of .",
    "this is clearly exemplified by the fact that the most metal - poor galaxies known at low-@xmath0 ( izw18 and sbs03350 - 52 ) are shown to be damped  absorbers @xcite in spectroscopic observations from the _ goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) _ and _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis)_. this is to be expected if the starburst is enshrouded by a static layer of neutral hydrogen that is able to resonantly trap , thereby greatly increasing the path - lengths of the photons in order to escape the host , and exponentially increasing the chance of their destruction by dust grains @xcite . further _",
    "observations @xcite showed that when  is seen in emission , it almost systematically shows a pcygni profile and systematic velocity offset from low ionisation state metal absorption features in the neutral ism , suggesting that an outflowing medium is an essential ingredient in the formation of the line profile and  escape physics .",
    "similar results have also been found at high-@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic models of expanding bubbles @xcite predicted  line profiles to follow an evolutionary sequence starting with pure absorption at the earliest times , developing through a pure emission phase into pcygni profiles as the ism is driven out by mechanical feedback from the starburst , and fading back into absorption at late times .",
    "this allowed @xcite to reconcile the variety of  profiles observed at low-@xmath0 in such an evolutionary sequence .",
    "further theoretical studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown how a wide variety of pcygni - like and asymmetric profiles can develop , depending on the ism properties and geometry .",
    "the line formation becomes more complex still if the ism is multiphase @xcite and certain physical and kinematic configurations may lead to increases in the fraction of escaping  photons compared to non - resonant radiation , thereby effectively boosting .",
    "recent advances have been made in the understanding of observed line profiles with the implementation of full 3-d codes with arbitrary distributions of gas , ionisation , temperature , dust , and kinematics @xcite .",
    "since nebular ionisation does not occur in situ with ionising sources , recombination line imaging ( e.g. ) may reveal a morphology different from that found by imaging of the stellar continuum",
    ". this phenomenon may be much more significant for  photons which resonantly scatter .",
    "while  and  have the same points of origin , it is likely that internal  scattering events may cause  photons to be emitted far from their production sites , and not be spatially correlated with  or other non - resonant recombination lines",
    ". targeted spectroscopic observations are therefore liable to miss a fraction of the emission and , while containing neither frequency nor kinematic information ,  imaging becomes an invaluable complement to the spectroscopic studies .",
    "this was the motivation for our imaging survey of local starbursts using the _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) _",
    "( @xcite in preparation ) .",
    "this is a truly unique dataset for a number of reasons .",
    "firstly the angular resolution of the _ acs _ allows us to map the morphology on scales of 515  pc ; 23 orders of magnitude better than typical studies at high-@xmath0 .",
    "the addition of  ( absent in almost all high-@xmath0 studies due to an inconvenient rest wavelength ) allows us to quantitatively examine the decoupling of  from non - resonant lines and estimate the global escape fractions .",
    "multiband uv and optical data allow us to map dust reddening , stellar ages and masses , ionising photon production , and other properties of the host , all at the same resolution as .",
    "the first detailed  imaging study of a local starburst , eso338-ig04 @xcite found emission and absorption varying on very small scales in the central starburst regions , and little or no correlation with the fuv morphology .",
    "the starburst is surrounded with a large , diffuse , low surface brightness halo that contributes @xmath7% to the global  luminosity , resulting from the resonant decoupling and diffusion of .",
    "the total escape fraction was found to be just @xmath8% , implying any global values ( eg .",
    "sfr ) that would be estimated from  alone would be seriously at fault .",
    "feedback processes from star - formation are capable of driving galaxy - scale ` superwinds ' that shock heat and accelerate the ambient medium and circumnuclear gas , resulting in large - scale , diffuse x - ray nebulae @xcite .",
    "typically , hot x - ray emitting regions exhibit a tight morphological correlation with with warm gas as probed by optical emission lines @xcite .",
    "indeed , such x - ray nebulae are near - ubiquitous in starbursts @xcite and have been calibrated as tracers of star - formation rates @xcite .",
    "@xcite have also shown that observed x - ray spectra are well reproduced by a single thermal plasma over a range of galaxy classifications spanning dwarfs , discs , and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirg ) , although the central regions of some ulirgs require an additional power - law component . since the diffuse x - ray component can be so valuable for an understanding of the wind properties , and feedback is an essential ingredient in the escape of   @xcite , x - ray information provides a valuable supporting dataset for a detailed investigation of .    in this article",
    "we turn our attention to another target in our sample , the well - known , luminous ( @xmath9 = -20.5 ) , low metallicity ( @xmath10 ; @xcite ) blue compact galaxy ( bcg ) .",
    "it exhibits a complex morphology consisting of three main star - forming condensations and an unrelaxed kinematic structure @xcite , suggestive of a dwarf galaxy merger .",
    "it is actively star - forming , exhibits a large number of bright young star clusters @xcite , is a known emitter of   @xcite , and the only known local candidate emitter of lyman continuum ( lyc ) @xcite .",
    "the fuv continuum luminosity puts haro11 at the brighter end of the distribution of  emitters at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we utilise _ hst / acs _ images in the fuv ( _ solar blind channel ; sbc _ ) , to examine  and nearby continuum , and broadband images in the uv and optical , and narrowband   ( _ high resolution camera ; hrc , and wide field camera ; wfc _ ) to examine dust , ages in the stellar population , the star cluster population as a whole , and estimate the lyc production .",
    "we use deep ground - based narrowband images in  and  in order to estimate extinction in the gas phase .",
    "x - ray observations of haro11 have been obtained using the _ chandra _ satellite @xcite but currently their status is still proprietary .",
    "we hence also exploit serendipitous off - axis observations from the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ x - ray observatories to study the wind properties and internal photoelectric absorption .",
    "the article is arranged in the following manner : in section  [ sect : data ] we describe the observations and data reductions ; in section  [ sect : res ] we present the results ; in section  [ sect : andis ] we analyse discuss the results ; and in section  [ sect : conc ] we present our concluding remarks .",
    "we assume a cosmology of @xmath12  km  s@xmath13  mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 throughout .",
    "the redshift of haro11 is taken to be 0.020598 from ned , corresponding to a luminosity distance of 87.1  mpc .",
    "this study makes use of images from all three channels of the _ acs _ onboard _ hst _ : the _ sbc _ for the fuv ; the _ hrc _ for the 2200  and @xmath16band ; and the more sensitive",
    "_ wfc _ for images in the optical domain .",
    "the details of the observations and post - reduction processing of the _ hst _ uv and optical dataset are described in a companion paper , @xcite .",
