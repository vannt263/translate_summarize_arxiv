    "the problems of origin and propagation of cosmic rays ( cr ) in the galaxy are long standing questions which need the combination of several different observations in a wide energy range to be answered @xcite .",
    "the most realistic description of cr propagation is given by diffusion models .",
    "two main approaches have been developed so far : ( semi-)analytical diffusion models ( see e.g.  @xcite and ref.s therein ) , which solve the cr transport equation by assuming simplified distributions for the sources and the interstellar gas , and fully numerical diffusion models .",
    "well known realizations of those two approaches are respectively the _ two - zone model _ @xcite and the galprop @xcite and dragon @xcite codes . generally these models involve a large number of parameters which need to be fixed against the observations .",
    "their knowledge is crucial not only for cr physics but also to be able to constrain / determine the properties of dark matter from indirect measurements .",
    "however , in spite of the strong efforts made on both observational and theoretical sides most of those parameters are still poorly known .",
    "one of the reasons lies in the fact that best quality data on cr spectra were available mainly at low energy ( @xmath1/n ) . at these energies",
    "several competing physical processes ( e.g.  solar modulation , convection , re - acceleration ) are expected to affect significantly the cr spectra to an _ a priori _ unknown amount .",
    "furthermore , at those energies uncertainties in spallation cross section determinations are still sizeable . at higher energies ,",
    "however , only spatial diffusion and spallation losses are expected to shape the cr spectra , the latter effect becoming less relevant with increasing energy .",
    "hence , the study of high energy cr spectra could allow to constrain the properties of the diffusion coefficient of cr in the galaxy .",
    "the scarcity of observational data has precluded this possibility for long time .",
    "the situation improved recently as the cream balloon experiment @xcite measured the relative abundances of elements from boron to oxygen , and especially the boron to carbon ratio ( b / c ) , up to energies around @xmath2/n .",
    "furthermore , valuable complementary data were recently provided by the pamela satellite experiment @xcite which measured the antiproton / proton ( @xmath3 ) ratio up to @xmath4 with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "also antiprotons are expected to be produced by the spallation of primary crs ( mainly protons and helium nuclei ) .",
    "they provide , therefore , an independent test of the validity of cr propagation models @xcite and , once these are validated , a valuable probe of dark matter models ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in this contribution",
    "we show that the data recently released by the cream and the pamela experiments can fit into a unique plain diffusion ( pd ) cr propagation model .",
    "we report the main results of a statistical analysis aimed at constraining the normalization and energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient of crs in the galaxy . in order to check the possible dependence on low energy effects of these constraints",
    ", we also study as they change by varying the minimum energy @xmath5 above which data are considered .",
    "in order to interpret the experimental data we need to adopt a theoretical model describing the propagation of cr nuclei in the galaxy between 1 and @xmath6 gev / n . at these energies , the propagation of stable crs is known to obey the transport equation @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the total energy of a nucleus with mass @xmath10 ) is the kinetic energy per nucleon , constant during propagation as practically conserved in fragmentation reactions , @xmath11 is the velocity of the nucleus in units of the speed of light @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the total inelastic cross section onto the ism gas with density @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the production cross - section of a nuclear species @xmath16 by the fragmentation of the @xmath17-th one .",
    "we start the spallation routine from @xmath18 .",
    "we disregard continuos energy losses , re - acceleration and convection , but we check _ a posteriori _ the validity of this approximation against the experimental data",
    ".    we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : transport ] ) in the stationary limit @xmath19 adopting our numerical code dragon @xcite .",
    "dragon was validated against well known public codes ( galprop ) and against experimental data of secondary / primary ratios , as well as @xmath20-ray data .",
    "we recall below the main assumptions we make .",
    "we assume cylindrical symmetry and that the regular magnetic field is azimuthally oriented @xmath21 . under these conditions",
    "cr diffusion out of the galaxy takes place only perpendicularly to @xmath22 .",
    "therefore @xmath23 represents in fact the perpendicular diffusion coefficient @xmath24 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath23 on the particle rigidity @xmath25 is ( see e.g.  @xcite )    @xmath26      for the source term we assume the general form @xmath27 imposing @xmath28 .",
    "we assume that the cr source spatial distribution @xmath29 trace that of galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) as modeled in @xcite on the basis of pulsar and progenitor star surveys @xcite .",
    "the injection abundances @xmath30 are tuned so that the propagated spectra of primary and secondary species match the observed ones .    for each value of @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff_coeff ] ) @xmath32 is fixed by the requirement that at high energy @xmath33/n , at which spallation processes are almost irrelevant , the equality @xmath34 is satisfied on earth is @xmath35 @xcite . ] .",
    "since our main goal is to understand in particular the diffusion properties , we want derive constraints on @xmath36 , @xmath31 and @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff_coeff ] ) .",
    "we consider these observables : n / o , c / o , b / c and @xmath38 ratios .",
    "they are primary / primary and secondary / primary ratios .",
    "the spectrum of secondary / primary ratios allows us to infer information directly on @xmath31 @xcite , but not separately on @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( these observables are sensitive to the ratio @xmath39 @xcite ) .",
    "a way to break this degeneracy is to consider unstable to stable ratios ( e.g.  @xmath40be/@xmath41be ) , which are known to probe the vertical height of the galaxy @xcite . in agreement with @xcite",
    "we infer that @xmath37 should lie between 3 and 5 kpc .",
    "we account for a solar modulation potential @xmath42 in the  force - free \" approximation .",
    "once the spatial distributions of the cr sources and the ism gas have been chosen , the main parameters determining the b / c in a pd model are the c / o and n / o injection ratios and the quantities @xmath31 and @xmath43 ( which will be always expressed in units of @xmath44 in this work ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff_coeff ] ) .",
    "we fix the source abundances of the oxygen and of primaries heavier than oxygen by requiring that they match the observed abundances in crs at @xmath45/n , while we use primary / primary ratios to fix the c / o and n / on + @xmath46n is a combination of primary and secondary nuclides . ]",
    "injection ratios .    as in @xcite",
    ", we accomplish this by sampling , for each pair ( @xmath43 , @xmath31 ) , the parameter space ( c / o , n / o ) and computing the @xmath47 of our predictions for the c / o and n / o modulated ratios against experimental data over the energy range of our interest . for the set of parameters that minimizes this @xmath47 ,",
    "we then compute the @xmath47 ( which we call @xmath48 ) of our predictions for the b / c ratio against data . by iterating this procedure for several values of the pair ( @xmath43 , @xmath31 )",
    ", we sample the whole parameter space of our interest .",
    "minimization of @xmath48 leads to the best fit values for ( @xmath49 ) and the appropriate confidence regions .",
    "the construction of a statistically meaningful variable for the @xmath38 ratio is rather simpler than for the b / c . indeed ,",
    "if we neglect the systematic uncertainties associated to the production and interaction cross sections , the propagation of secondary antiprotons depends essentially on @xmath39 , @xmath31 and the source abundance ratio he / p .",
    "this last unknown can be easily fixed by looking at the measured spectrum of he at earth , which is relatively well known .",
    "therefore , we construct a @xmath50 by comparing our predicted @xmath3 spectrum for different values of ( @xmath51 ) to experimental observations .      since we have two different data - sets for the same physical framework , it is important to find links for joint optmization of the combined analysis .",
    "the two data - sets being uncorrelated , it is possible to define a joint @xmath47 knowing the single results of the previous analysis @xmath52 and minimize it with respect to ( @xmath53 ) .    the complementary nature of the two data sets will be demonstrated in section [ subsec : results ] in which the overlapping of the separated analysis is evident .",
    "so far the best b / c measurements above @xmath54/n have been provided by the heao-3 @xcite and crn @xcite experiments in the range @xmath55/n and @xmath56/n .",
    "recently , the cream @xcite experiment has released data @xcite improving significantly the available statistics at high energy .",
    "c / o and n / o data are taken from the same experiments as well .    for antiprotons",
    "we use experimental data released by bess for the periods 1995 - 97 @xcite and 1998 @xcite in the energy interval @xmath57 , and by caprice ( 1998 ) @xcite in the range @xmath58 .",
    "recently also the pamela experiment has released @xmath38 data in the energy range @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "we include them in our analysis .",
    "solar modulation has been demonstrated to have important effects in the determination of the @xmath3 ratio at low energy .",
    "we account for modulation in the force free approximation . for each data set",
    "we use the solar potential of the year when data were taken .          [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : combo ] we show our results for the separated and joint analysis of the b / c and @xmath3 data .",
    "the left - hand plots represent the 1 , 2 and 3@xmath60 contour levels of the @xmath48 , in the @xmath61 space , the central plots show the same contour levels for @xmath50 , while the right - hand side plot is the result of the joint analysis described in section [ subsec : joint ] variables are always understood to be `` reduced '' @xmath47 . ] . from the panels in the first column",
    "the impact of cream results on our knowledge of the propagation parameters is evident : cream high energy data favour a smaller value of @xmath31 with respect to previous ones . also pamela @xmath3 data are sensitive to our propagation parameters , in contrast with pre - pamela @xmath3 data ( see the upper row panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : combo ] ) . finally , it is clear from the lower row panels as for @xmath62 there is an almost complete concordance between the cl regions constrained by high energy b / c and @xmath3 data . indeed",
    ", even the 1@xmath60 regions do have a significant overlapping and the minimum joint @xmath47 is 1.2 for @xmath63/n .",
    "the joint analysis indicates a best - fit value of @xmath64 , possibly favouring a kraichnan power spectrum for the turbulent galactic magnetic field . while the best fit for @xmath31 seems not to be strongly dependent on @xmath5 , we find that the best value of @xmath39 tends to be larger when a larger @xmath5 is considered .",
    "this could indicate , in agreement with nave expectations , that the scale of vertical diffusion @xmath37 is smaller at higher energies .",
    "the concordance between nuclear and antiproton data is also evident from fig .",
    "[ wide_fig ] where the predictions of the combined analysis best - fit model are compared with b / c and @xmath3 experimental data .    finally , in tab .",
    "[ tab : best_fits ] we recap the findings of our minimization strategy .",
    "best fit values for ( @xmath51 ) are obtained considering first the two data sets separetely and then jointly .",
    "our analysis shows clearly that the two data sets are statistically compatible , within our model .",
    "we performed a statistical analysis to constrain the cr propagation parameters in a plain diffusion scenario numerically implemented in dragon .",
    "taking advantage of the new cream and pamela high - energy data we performed a combined analysis of b / c and @xmath65 data in several energy ranges .",
    "this approach allowed us to test the ( weak ) dependence of our results on poorly know low - energy physics .",
    "we showed that above few gev / n the whole data sets considered here are consistently reproduced by a pd model .",
    "our findings favour a kraichnan type ( @xmath66 ) dependence of the diffusion coefficient on energy .",
