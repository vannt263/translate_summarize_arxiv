    "magnetic reconnection is an important large - scale processes in space plasmas . by rearranging the magnetic field topology , it causes heating and particle acceleration of plasmas as well as dissipation of the magnetic fields .",
    "although it has been extensively studied in wide range of solar terrestrial sites stellar and solar flares @xcite , the planetary magnetospheres @xcite and solar wind @xcite it has also been discussed in high - energy astrophysical contexts such as the magnetized loop of the galactic center @xcite , the jets from active galactic nuclei @xcite , quite probably gamma - ray bursts @xcite , and pulsar winds @xcite . in these situations",
    ", reconnection often takes place in relativistic electron - positron plasmas . especially in the crab pulsar wind , in the relativistic outflow of pair plasmas from the central neutron star , relativistic reconnection or relevant processes",
    "have been considered as possible processes to explain the long - standing `` @xmath3-problem '' ( @xmath3 is the ratio of the poynting flux energy to the particle kinetic flux ) ; the plasma outflow is originally poynting - dominated ( @xmath4 ) close to the neutron star @xcite , but it should be kinetic - dominated near the downstream termination shock ( @xmath5 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the possible dissipation mechanisms are instabilities in the striped current sheets ; due to the fast rotation of the central neutron star , whose magnetic dipole is in the oblique direction , alternating magnetic fields are strongly `` striped '' near the equatorial plane .",
    "we assume that there are current sheets between such opposite magnetic field lines , and magnetic reconnection occurs and dissipates the magnetic energy there @xcite .",
    "based on this idea , magnetic dissipation in the pulsar wind has been estimated by using a one - dimensional mhd model @xcite , but they were not so successful .",
    "the main problem is that basic properties of relativistic reconnection or current sheet processes are still unclear .    until recent years",
    ", there have been few theoretical studies on relativistic reconnection .",
    "@xcite studied the relativistic kinetic description of the tearing instability , which is the most important instability in the reconnection context .",
    "@xcite studied the steady state reconnection models in relativistic pair plasmas .",
    "they argued that the reconnection rate becomes closer to the unity due to lorentz effects , and therefore , faster energy conversion is possible .",
    "these steady models are further investigated by several authors @xcite , although there is controversy about whether inflow speed can be relativistic or not . on the viewpoint of particle acceleration , @xcite studied the particle orbits in the reconnection field model , and they obtained an energetic energy spectrum of pair plasma , which is approximated by the power - law distribution with an index of @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite obtained the power - law index of @xmath7 , assuming that particle motion is restricted in the neutral plane . in a fully self - consistent way",
    ", relativistic magnetic reconnection has recently been explored by particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that an enhanced @xmath8 acceleration takes place in and around the @xmath9-type region , due to the reconnection electric field @xmath10 .",
    "this acceleration is so strong that a power law index of the energy spectrum around the acceleration site is on the order of @xmath7 @xcite , and the energy spectrum over the whole simulation domain is approximated by the power - law with an index of @xmath11 @xcite . using relativistic resistive mhd code",
    ", @xcite presented petschek reconnection in the mildly relativistic case .",
    "the current sheet configuration with antiparallel magnetic field lines is also influenced by cross field instabilities , whose wavevectors are perpendicular to the reconnection plane . in geophysical contexts , the lower hybrid drift instability ( lhdi ) @xcite may be of importance , and it leads to transport of plasma heat @xcite and the fast triggering of magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) @xcite , which arises from the velocity shear between the fast - drifting plasmas in the current sheet and the background plasmas , is of importance because of its significant modulation , and it enhances the magnetic diffusion rate by the lhdi @xcite . recently the drift kink instability ( dki ) @xcite and its cousin mode of the drift sausage instability ( dsi ) @xcite have been introduced .",
    "the dki is a long - wavelength electromagnetic mode , which is driven by the fast - drifting plasmas in a thin current sheet and it quickly grows when the mass ratio of the positively charged particles to the electrons is small @xcite .",
    "therefore the dki smears out in geophysical ion - electron situations but the nonlinear development of the lhdi may lead to the current sheet modulation by the dki @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , the dki quickly grows in relativistic pair plasmas in which the mass ratio is the unity , while the lhdi smears out .",
    "@xcite investigated the dki in relativistic current sheets of pair plasmas , and they found a @xmath8 particle acceleration along the neutral sheet in the nonlinear stage of the relativistic drift kink instability ( rdki ) . because of its fast growth rate , the rdki is one of the most likely processes in relativistic current sheets .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate basic physical properties of reconnection or reconnection - related processes in relativistic pair plasmas .",
    "two types of two - dimensional problems , relativistic magnetic reconnection and the rdki , are demonstrated by using fully electromagnetic pic simulations .",
    "in addition , based on the obtained theories we discuss possible application to the crab pulsar wind problem .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe our simulation setup . in  3 a two - dimensional simulation study of relativistic magnetic reconnection is presented . in ",
    "4 another two - dimensional study of the rdki is presented . in ",
    "5 we compare the two results and discuss the possible application to the pulsar winds .",
    "the simulation is carried out by a three - dimentional electromagnetic pic code . in this code",

    "the solid lines represent magnetic field lines .",
    "the field lines are originally in the @xmath76 direction on the upside of the current sheet and the @xmath77 direction on the downside of the current sheet . because of the triggering field ,",
    "the field lines start to reconnect near the center of the simulation box . along with the magnetic field lines ,",
    "plasmas from the background region come into the @xmath9-type region and then they stream out as reconnection jets toward the @xmath78 directions .",
    "the evolution looks like sweet - parker type reconnection with a flat current sheet structure .",

    "the outflow speed exceeds the typical alfvn speed in the system . at @xmath80 and @xmath74 ,",
    "reconnected magnetic field lines ( @xmath81 ) are swept away from the @xmath9-type region . as a result",

    "after @xmath84 , the system is influenced by the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "reconnection outflow jets come closer to the @xmath51-periodic boundaries at @xmath85 , where the plasma density starts to increase . in addition , the @xmath9-point starts to sweep magnetic flux from the other simulation box . at @xmath84 , the magnetic field lines at the @xmath9-point",
    "come from @xmath8612 - 13 around @xmath87 .",
    "note that the @xmath54-boundaries are located at @xmath88 .",
    "dense plasma regions are blown away from the center , they meet each other near the @xmath51-periodic boundaries .",
    "then they merge into a single @xmath89-point , and the @xmath89-point starts to evolve in the vertical ( @xmath54 ) direction .",
    "after that , the system evolves gradually to another relaxed state : vertical current sheets .",
    "figure [ fig : rec3 ] is a snapshot in the late - time stage at @xmath72 .",

    "the white rectangle indicates the region in the snapshots from figure [ fig : rec_snapshot ] .",
    "the magnetic fields are antiparallel ; @xmath92 in the left half ( @xmath93 ) and @xmath94 in the right half ( @xmath95 ) , but at present we do not observe the secondary magnetic reconnection in these vertical current sheets .",
    "the panels in figure [ fig : recspec ] are energy spectra in the main simulation box .",
    "the vertical axis shows the count number of super particles on a log scale , and the horizontal axis shows particle s energy which is normalized by the rest - mass energy @xmath96 .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : recspec ] presents the energy spectra in double - log format .",
    "the spectrum labeled by @xmath97 is the partial energy spectrum at @xmath84 , which is integrated near the central region of @xmath98 .",
    "after the reconnection breaks up , the high - energy tail rapidly grows in time .",
    "this is due to the @xmath8 particle acceleration around the @xmath9-point @xcite and we discuss the acceleration mechanism in more detail in  3.2 .",
    "the slope of the spectrum at @xmath80 is well approximated by the power - law distribution with an index of @xmath99 to @xmath100 in the range of @xmath101 .",
    "this is consistent with the other study ; @xcite obtained a spectral index of @xmath11 in their pic simulations with lower temperature @xmath102 . at @xmath84 ,",
    "the spectrum seems to have a double power - law shape , whose hardest slope is roughly approximated by the index of @xmath103 .",
    "the partial energy spectrum at @xmath84 looks harder . finally , the maximum energy is up to @xmath104 .",
    "the late - time state at @xmath72 also has its spectral index of @xmath103 .",
    "the panels in figure [ fig : rece ] show the electric field structure at @xmath80 and @xmath74 . because of the symmetry , we present two properties , @xmath105 in the left halves ( @xmath106 ) and the reconnection electric field @xmath10 in the right halves ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "the white contour lines are drawn by @xmath108 .",
    "since the reconnection magnetic fields ( @xmath109 or @xmath81 ) are small near the @xmath9-type region and since the reconnection electric field @xmath10 is finite , @xmath105 becomes positive inside the narrow sheet region around the @xmath9-type region ; @xmath110 at @xmath80 and @xmath111 at @xmath84 .",
    "the reconnection electric field @xmath10 is almost constant around the @xmath9-type region : @xmath112 at @xmath80 and @xmath113 at @xmath84 .",
    "there are strong peaks around @xmath114 at @xmath80 , @xmath115 at @xmath84 .",
    "these regions are identical to the magnetic pile - up regions , where the reconnected magnetic field lines are compressed in front of the dense current sheet regions .",
    "the electric fields @xmath10 are enhanced due to the motional electric field of the magnetic piled - up flux .",
    "the other two components ( @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) are negligible .",
    "next , we look at the particle acceleration in relativistic reconnection . in order to analyze how and where the nonthermal particles are accelerated , we pick up high - energy particles whose energy exceeds @xmath118 at @xmath119 .",
    "the panels in figure [ fig : dist ] show their spatial distribution at three different stages . at @xmath120 ,",
    "some particles are near the @xmath9-type region and other particles are widely scattered in the background region .",
    "importantly , they stay around or move into the @xmath9-type region at @xmath121 , when the reconnection breaks up .",
    "the nonthermal tail in the energy spectra starts to grow in this stage .",
    "as the reconnection evolves , they are spread over the thin current sheet , and then some of them are ejected from the reconnection region .",
    "the acceleration site is obviously the central region in and around the @xmath9-type region .",
    "looking at the electromagnetic fields near the acceleration site in panels in figure [ fig : rece ] , we note that the electric fields are relatively stronger than the magnetic fields .",
    "we call the central region that satisfies @xmath122 the `` acceleration region '' ( ar ) , where the electric field is dominant . in two - dimensional reconnection , @xmath122 is equivalent to our old definition of the ar : @xmath123 in @xcite ( hereafter zh01 ) .",
    "such an ar does not have a de hoffman - teller frame .",
    "for example , let us consider an electromagnetic field @xmath124 near the @xmath9-points along the neutral sheet ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "the fields can be transformed into @xmath126 where the prime is for the transformed properties , @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the transformation speeds , and @xmath129 are the relevant lorentz factors . generally ,",
    "when the lorentz invariant @xmath105 is positive , the electric field can not be removed and the particle motion in the ar is controlled by the electric field in the transformed frame . in the observer s frame , particles are driven into some @xmath53-aligned direction , gaining their energy through the reconnection electric field @xmath10 .",
    "so , once particles enter the acceleration site , they are driven by the electric field @xmath130 inside the ar and they travel through ( relativistic ) speiser orbits @xcite outside the ar . the ar looks thinner in @xmath54 compared with zh01 , but the thickness of the ar does not provide significant change because the magnetic field @xmath109 confines particles near the neutral sheet in a reconnection configuration . in zh01 , we estimate that the energy distribution in the ar can be approximated by the power law distribution , whose index is on the order of @xmath7 . although it is difficult to evaluate the partial energy spectra in the ar by power law , the index is between @xmath131 and @xmath7 in figure [ fig : recspec ] .    in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : dist ] ,",
    "the red spots present @xmath132 particles , whose energy exceeds @xmath133 at @xmath119 .",
    "they are found only near the magnetic pileup regions along the flat current sheet layer . according to the partial and the main energy spectra at @xmath119 in figure [ fig : recspec ] , the intermediate - energy particles ( @xmath134 )",
    "are found both inside and outside the selected region and their spectral slopes look similar .",
    "the selected region has fewer intermediate - energy particles by a factor of @xmath135 , because the region is narrower than the typical current sheet length . on the contrary , high - energy particles whose energy exceeds @xmath136",
    "are only found outside the selected region .",
    "therefore , these highest energy particles are accelerated outside the selected region of @xmath98 .",
    "in fact , during @xmath121 and @xmath137 , the highest - energy shoulder increases by @xmath138 , and some particles apparently gain more energy than the maximum energy gain inside the ar , @xmath139 , where we use @xmath140 as the typical value .",
    "then , we traced the most energetic positron , whose energy is @xmath141 at @xmath119 and who is found at @xmath142 . its trajectory and @xmath143-/@xmath144- projections are presented in figure [ fig : orbit ] .",
    "labels in the @xmath144 plane indicate the relevant times .",
    "time histories of the relevant properties are presented in figure [ fig : orbit2 ] , too .",
    "originally , the positron s motion is well explained by the meandering motion ; it bounces around the neutral sheet in the @xmath145 direction .",
    "around @xmath146 , the reconnection breaks up and the positron enters the @xmath9-type region ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "then , it is driven by the reconnection electric field @xmath10 and its energy starts to increase . in the gray background regions ,",
    "the field satisfies the condition of the ar , @xmath148 .",
    "this particle does not always stay in the ar , because it travels near the edge of the ar .",
    "after @xmath149 , the positron departs from the central ar and then it starts to travel through the ( relativistic ) speiser orbit .",
    "the energy already reaches up to @xmath150 through particle acceleration in / near the central ar . at this stage ,",
    "the positron s larmor radius is @xmath151 . because of a relativistic inertia effect , it can travel a longer distance into the @xmath53-direction through speiser orbit .",
    "if we observe this particle in the moving frame of the plasma outflow , its energy stays nearly constant after @xmath152 . in the simulation frame ,",
    "the particle gains further energy from @xmath10 until it is ejected into the @xmath51-direction .",
    "interestingly , in this case the particle gains more energy than the standard speiser orbit case , because the electric field @xmath10 increases in time at the particle s position .",
    "figure [ fig : stack ] is an @xmath51-@xmath153 diagram of the positron s position and the @xmath10-profile .",
    "the dashed line presents the positron trajectory , and the stack plots show the time development of the reconnection electric field @xmath10 along the neutral sheet ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "surprisingly , the positron always stays around the peak of the electric field @xmath10 , which is related to the magnetic pile - up region .",
    "since magnetic field lines are continuously transported from the @xmath9-type region , the piled - up peak increases in its height , and then @xmath10 is further enhanced by the relevant motional electric field .",
    "in other words , the particle speed resonates with the propagating speed of the reconnection pileup front @xmath154 , which is slightly slower than the reconnection outflow speed . in the geophysical ion - electron contexts ,",
    "@xcite studied ion acceleration and @xcite studied electron acceleration in the magnetic dipole / pileup regions . in both cases ,",
    "particles gain their energy from @xmath10 , through @xmath155 drift motion in the @xmath53-direction . in our case ,",
    "the particle directly resonates with the fields . in order to stay for a long time in the piled - up front",
    ", the particle has to be heavy enough or the particle s larmor radius has to be large enough .",
    "therefore , only high - energy particles can be continuously accelerated to the highest energy ; most of them are preaccelerated around the ar when they enter the piled - up regions .",
    "low - energy particles are quickly ejected into the outflow directions .",
    "when these pileup regions hit the downstream dense regions , it releases a lot of energy into the downstream plasma energy .",
    "the downstream plasmas increase their energy on the order of @xmath156 , where the prime denotes the physical properties in the piled - up front frame , and this mirror effect explains the mild enhancement of the global energy spectra around @xmath157 . if we compare the piled - up region with the ar , the piled - up region mainly contributes to the plasma heating , but it also enhances the maximum energy of a small number of highly accelerated particles . a similar mechanism is reported in @xcite , although their difference between the @xmath8 acceleration in the centeral ar and this piled - up acceleration was not clear .",
    "their system becomes highly turbulent , because the main reconnection is suppressed by the conductive wall boundary effect in the inflow region .",
    "on the contrary , in our case , the main reconnection is so powerful that it sweeps out everything into the @xmath78 direction , including small tearing islands in its early stage .",
    "therefore , the acceleration continues for a longer time , until outflow jets reach the periodic boundaries .",
    "we do not know how long the single reconnection region can dominate , but we remark that the higher maximum energy will be obtained when a single reconnection dominates .",
    "figure [ fig : stack2 ] summarizes the acceleration mechanism , presenting the electromagnetic field properties at @xmath84 along the neutral plane @xmath125 . as stated , the electric field is larger than the magnetic field @xmath81 near the @xmath9-type region @xmath158 , while @xmath81 exceeds @xmath10 in @xmath159 .",
    "the dashed line presents the ratio of @xmath10 to @xmath81 , which agrees with the plasma outflow speed around the outflow the region . in this figure",
    ", we can classify the acceleration site into the following three types :    central acceleration region where @xmath122 and @xmath8 direct acceleration takes place .",
    "outside region where @xmath160 and particles are accelerated through the ( relativistic ) speiser orbit .",
    "magnetic pileup region where some high - energy particles resonate with the enhanced electric field .",
    "regarding the boundary effects on the late - time development , the plasma collision across the @xmath51-boundaries enhances the magnetic pileup flux and the relevant acceleration .",
    "however , such a collision is quite likely to occur in realistic situations .",
    "for example , the coalescence of multiple reconnection islands have recently attracted our attention because it generates energetic particles @xcite . since our system width ( @xmath161 ) is rather larger than the typical scale of the tearing mode ( @xmath162 , assuming that the fastest mode is @xmath163 ) , we believe that the @xmath51-boundary effect is plausible .",
    "the @xmath54-boundary effect may be rather artificial ; however , it is unlikely that the @xmath54-boundary effect accelerates the reconnection process in the early stage of @xmath164 .",
    "the inflow magnetic flux continually decreases in time ( approximately half of the original flux @xmath165 at @xmath84 ) and then it starts to increase in the later stages at @xmath166 , due to the @xmath89-point expansion in the sub simulation domain . in the striped pulsar wind condition , it is possible that double / multiple current sheets are close to each other . since we note that the late - time energy spectra become even harder ( with an index of @xmath167 ) , these results imply that harder energy spectra may be generated when the pulsar wind is crowded by the multiple current sheets .",
    "of course , it is very difficult to discuss the spectral index from the simulation results , because it shows the very early development in a small region compared with actual astrophysical phenomena .",
    "it just gives us a hint to discuss an astronomical long - time / large - scale evolution and the resulting energy spectra .",
    "we have further carried out five simulation runs with different temperature parameters ; @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "we call them runs r1-r5 and their parameters are presented in table [ table ] . the background plasma temperature @xmath35 is always set to @xmath170 and @xmath171 , the ratio of the number density in the simulation frame ,",
    "is fixed to @xmath172 .",
    "the amplitude and duration of triggering fields are selected case by case , but we usually use smaller values than run r3 . for comparison ,",
    "our previous work ( zh01 ) is presented as run r0 , whose parameters are equivalent to @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "the results of the parameter studies are presented in figures [ fig : rec4 ] , [ fig : recspech ] , and [ fig : rec_hist ] and table [ tab : rec_alfven ] .",
    "figure [ fig : rec4 ] shows typical snapshots in runs r1 and r5 ( @xmath175 and @xmath169 ) .",
    "the energy spectra in run r1 are also presented in figure [ fig : recspech ] .",
    "the enhancements of plasma kinetic energies in runs r1-r5 are presented in figure [ fig : rec_hist]_a_. their energies are normalized by the plasma pressure energy in the original current sheet , which is roughly proportional to the temperature @xmath27 .",
    "the time axis is re - arranged so that reconnection breaks up nearly at the same time .",

    "we use equations ( [ eq : dki4 ] ) , ( [ eq : rdki5 ] ) , and ( [ eq : rti ] ) .",
    "generally , the rdki / rdsi grows faster than reconnection .",
    "most parts of the frontmost flat region ( @xmath257 and @xmath349 ) rely on equation ( [ eq : upper ] ) or ( [ eq : rdki5 ] ) .",
    "it seems that the rdki s rate goes down around @xmath350 , but our fluid theory is no longer valid here , because the current sheet is too thin ( eq . [ [ eq : debye ] ] ) .",
    "also , the fluid theory is not valid around the backward region of @xmath351 and @xmath337 , where the larmor radius is comparable with or larger than the sheet thickness @xmath24 ( eq . [ [ eq : gyro ] ] ) . except for these invalid regions",
    ", we can conclude that the rdki is more likely to occur in a relativistic hot condition of @xmath181 .",
    "importantly , in the relativistic regime of @xmath42 our simulations show no drastic change .",
    "the various aspects are similar : the evolution of the reconnection or the rdki structure , time history of total energy , nonthermal ratio , relative height of the nonthermal slope , and the maximum energy of the nonthermal tail .",
    "these results are quite reasonable considering the following facts .",
    "the characteristic speed is around the light speed @xmath352 ( table [ tab : rec_alfven ] ) and the typical larmor radius relative to the sheet width is nearly constant ( eq . [",
    "[ eq : rgyro ] ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward that the typical gyro period @xmath353 is constant when normalized by the light transit time @xmath276 .",
    "so , we can conclude that the physical processes are `` similar '' in these relativistic cases , as long as we consider kinetics .",
    "therefore , by employing the moderately - relativistic simulation ( @xmath354 ) , we may figure out ultra - relativistic kinetic evolution , which is computationally more expensive ; one has to resolve the gyro motion of the lowest energy particle ( @xmath355 ) while the system evolution is governed by the typical gyro period @xmath356 .",
    "if we start to consider radiation effects , we need another approach because the synchrotron radiation highly depends on the ultra relativistic lorentz factor : @xmath357 or @xmath348 .",
    "let us discuss a possible application to the striped pulsar wind @xcite .",
    "our comparison shows that the rdki is the most likely process in the current sheet , as long as plasmas are relativistic hot ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "if the current - aligned magnetic field ( the so - called guide field , @xmath203 ) exists , secondary magnetic reconnection will dominate @xcite ; however , magnetic fields are expected to be highly toroidal inside the striped pulsar wind due to the fast rotation of the neutron star , and therefore the guide field would be weak or unlikely to exist . therefore , here we assume that the rdki dominates in the striped current sheets .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter ks03 ) has examined the magnetic dissipation problem by using the expanding current sheets model .",
    "they estimated the magnetic dissipation rate , assuming that striped current sheets are expanding with a `` dissipation speed '' of @xmath358 , where @xmath359 is the dimensionless speed .",
    "they assumed magnetic reconnection as the most likely process , and they estimated the dissipation speed with the growth rate of the relativistic tearing mode @xcite in their `` tearing mode - limited '' scenario .",

    "39 ] in ks03 ) and the dissipation speed ( @xmath359 ) , the asymptotic solution @xmath360 can be obtained , where @xmath361 is a ratio of the current sheet thickness to the wavelength of the striped current sheets and @xmath362 is the spectral index .",
    "two of their scenarios are presented in table [ ks03table ] .",
    "they assume that the current sheets are completely dissipated at the radial distance of @xmath363 from the central neutron star , where @xmath364 is the distance of the light cylinder .",
    "two columns of @xmath363 are presented ; the first column is the analytical form , and the second column is the estimated value by using crab parameters .",
    "the termination shock is at @xmath365 , and so @xmath366 is a favorable result .",
    "the `` fast '' scenario is a physical upper limit ; its dissipation speed is based on the relativistic sound speed of @xmath367 . in the tearing mode - limited scenario",
    ", they set @xmath368 , where @xmath369 ( eq . [ 35 ] in ks03 ) is a simplified form of equation ( [ eq : rti ] ) .",
    "if we modify the dissipation speed with the maximum growth rate of @xmath370 ( from eq .",
    "[ [ eq : rti2 ] ] ) , the dissipation distance ( @xmath371 ) increases by 50% .",
    "the modified value is presented as the `` tearing mode  limited ( modified ) '' scenario in table [ ks03table ] .",
    "we propose a similar dissipation scenario by the rdki .",
    "we consider that the current sheet evolves to the broadened current sheet by the rdki and then it continues to expand by the cascading rdki processes .",
    "we call it the `` drift kink mode  limited '' scenario .",
    "we assume that the current sheet expands by @xmath372(3 - 4 ) times by single rdki process : the sheet s typical width @xmath24 becomes @xmath373 , where the prime denotes the physical value in the broadened current sheet after the first instability is saturated .",
    "consequently , the plasma density in the current sheet is @xmath374 . for simplicity ,",
    "we ignore the particle acceleration effect , because nonthermal particles carry less than 10% of kinetic energies ( in fig .",
    "[ fig : dki_hist]_b _ ) . assuming the pressure balance condition @xmath375 , the second - stage plasma temperature increases to @xmath376 due to the nonlinear mixing of the rdki .",
    "then , the debye length @xmath377 and the larmor radius @xmath378 remain constant , relative to the sheet width . regarding the the relativistic harris parameters , @xmath379 remains constant , while the temperature increases , @xmath376 . according to figure [ fig : rec_vs_dki2 ] ,",
    "the rdki is likely to occur again in the broadened condition .",
    "so , it is quite plausible that the current sheet is dissipated by series of the rdki processes .",
    "topologically , the rdki is favorable for the current sheet dissipation scenario , because it does evolve into the broadened current sheet structure , while it is not sure that reconnection evolves into the broaden current sheet . in thick current sheets of @xmath257",
    ", we evaluate the dissipation speed using equation ( [ eq : rdki7 ] ) ; @xmath380 .",
    "it is a good approximation of the eigen growth rates by a factor of 1 - 3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rec_vs_dki_beta ] ) . using this , following ks03 s method ,",
    "one can obtain the asymptotic index @xmath381 and relevant values .",
    "these values are presented in table [ ks03table ] .",
    "if we use the typical parameters , the obtained dissipation distance is @xmath382 .",
    "this value is 3 times better than the original tearing mode scenario and the drift - kink - mode scenario substantially improves the dissipation model in the striped pulsar wind .    by the way ,",
    "our dki / rdki theory is based on a long - wavelength assumption . in a nonrelativistic ion - electron plasma ,",
    "it is reported that short - wavelength current sheet instability grows faster than long - wavelength modes @xcite .",
    "magnetic dissipation becomes even faster , if short - wavelength mode grows faster in a thick current sheet . in a thin current sheet ,",
    "the nonthermal accelerations are more likely to transfer magnetic energy into the @xmath53-momentum @xmath383 of nonthermal plasmas .",
    "then , since the @xmath54-pressure relatively decreases , the current sheet may be thinner and the rdki may grow faster ( fig . [",
    "fig : rec_vs_dki2 ] ) . in a thick current sheet of @xmath257",
    ", we can probably ignore nonthermal acceleration because few particles satisfy the threshold condition ( eq . [ [ eq : threshold ] ] ) . when neighboring current sheets come close to each other , they start to collide each other during the nonlinear stage of the rdki .",
    "we compare several runs with different simulation box size @xmath384 ( runs d3 , d3b , and d3c in table [ table ] ) . in run",
    "d3c , the current sheets collide with each other across the periodic @xmath54-boundaries and more than 90% of the magnetic energy is dissipated into particle energy . on the other hand , the actual dissipation speed may be somewhat slower than the growth rates of the instabilities ( both the rdki and the tearing mode ) .",
    "so , an effective dissipation speed should be further investigated by a larger simulation , in which we can observe cascading evolution of the rdki . if the current sheet structure survives at the termination shock , the magnetic fields may further be dissipated by the collision of the shock and current sheets . in the downstream of the shock",
    ", magnetic reconnection may be triggered by turbulent electric fields .    in summary",
    ", we propose the rdki as an alternative magnetic dissipation scenario in the striped current sheets , based on our theoretical estimates . at present",
    "we do not know whether or not the rdki is the final key to explain the @xmath3 problem ; however , the drift kink mode scenario is obviously more favorable than the reconnection / tearing mode scenario .      in ion - electron reconnection",
    ", various instabilities occur in different scales .",
    "for example , the lhdi occurs on an electron scale , the dki on an ion scale , reconnection is on a macroscopic mhd scale , and then coupling across these scales leads a complexity of plasma phenomena . in this study",
    ", we investigate a very thin current sheet in @xmath0 plasmas .",
    "consequently , both the reconnection and the rdki occur in the same scale as the current sheet .",
    "both of them greatly violate the current sheet structure , and we discuss them as competing processes .",
    "when we consider a `` thick '' current sheet , the rdki or other cross - field instabilities may occur on a rather microscopic scale , and then they may interact with the macroscopic reconnection process .",
    "these situations should be further investigated .",
    "it has been believed that the reconnection s global energy dissipation is controlled by the hall physics @xcite . in pair plasmas ,",
    "the relevant positron s contribution is canceled out by electron s , and so the hall effect does not exist .",
    "however , simulations of pair plasma reconnection @xcite reported fast reconnection rates [ @xmath385 or @xmath386 , @xmath387 of @xmath388 or above . this issue is equivalent to the question `` what is the origin of the reconnection electric field ? '' . in classical nonrelativistic studies , the electric field is described by @xmath389 where @xmath390 is the electron s velocity and @xmath391 is the electron s pressure tensor .",
    "the hall effect comes from the difference in the electron lorentz term ( @xmath392 ) and its ion counterpart , and it smears out in the case of pair plasmas .",
    "@xcite showed that the pressure - tensor term explains the electric field in the vicinity of the neutral region .",
    "similar analysis can be applied to relativistic cases , using the relativistic pressure tensor @xcite .",
    "in addition , the electron s inertia may be of importance due to the increasing mass from the lorentz effect .",
    "let us summarize and conclude this paper .",
    "we have carried out series of pic simulations of relativistic current sheet problems in pair plasmas .",
    "we examine the relativistic magnetic reconnection and we report that particles can be accelerated near the magnetic pile - up region as well as the @xmath9-type region .",
    "we have also studied the current sheet instabilities , which exists in the perpendicular plane to reconnection .",
    "the parameter survey shows that properties of these two processes are similar in the relativistic regime of @xmath2 , as long as we consider the kinetics .",
    "in addition , by comparing their growth rates , the rdki is the more likely process in the relativistic regime of @xmath2 .",
    "therefore we propose that the magnetic dissipation in the striped pulsar wind should be re - considered by using the rdki .",

    "<S> it is demonstrated that particles are strongly accelerated in and around the reconnection region and that most of the magnetic energy is converted into a `` nonthermal '' part of plasma kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> second , we present another two - dimensional problem of a current sheet in a cross - field plane . in this case , the relativistic drift kink instability ( rdki ) occurs . </S>",
    "<S> particle acceleration also takes place , but the rdki quickly dissipates the magnetic energy into plasma heat . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the mechanism of particle acceleration and the theory of the rdki in detail . </S>",
    "<S> it is important that properties of these two processes are similar in the relativistic regime of @xmath2 , as long as we consider the kinetics . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the two processes indicates that magnetic dissipation by the rdki is a more favorable process in the relativistic current sheet . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the striped pulsar wind scenario should be reconsidered by the rdki . </S>"
