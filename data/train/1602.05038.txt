    "graph coloring is , undoubtedly , one of the main problems in discrete mathematics , attracting researchers from both mathematics and engineering because of its theoretical challenges and its applications  @xcite .",
    "one of the most prominent applications of vertex - coloring problems is frequency assignment  @xcite , with a huge number of models ranging from the most naive , forbidding monochromatic edges , to the most general , with assignment constraints , interference constraints , and an objective function .",
    "the present work explores an intermediate model , which is both attackable enough for mathematicians and useful enough for engineers : we are given an abstract graph  @xmath0 and a spectrum of colors  @xmath1 endowed with a matrix  @xmath2 of non - negative distances , or interferences , @xmath3 between each pair of colors . throughout this paper ,",
    "the graph  @xmath0 will be undirected and , thus , the matrix  @xmath2 will be symmetric .",
    "for such a pair @xmath4 , a coloring @xmath5 of the graph will induce at each vertex  @xmath6 an _ interference _ @xmath7    although this setting should be of interest in arts and decor , since the ciede2000 formula has recently be developed to measure actual distances between industrial colors  @xcite , our interest steams mainly from its very clear application to wifi channel assignment .",
    "we all use the ieee 802.11 ( wifi ) technology , which has been widely deployed in local area networks mostly because of both its low cost and the use of unlicensed frequency band",
    ". however , for a successful deployment there are some performance issues to be managed , such as avoiding an excessive interference that will impact performance : there is a direct relation between interference and perceived throughput  @xcite , so that minimizing the interference should result in maximizing the available throughput .",
    "this is why a frequency channel has to be selected for each access point ( ap ) accounting for interferences between channels and trying to minimize the total interference , in order to maximize performance .",
    "similar goals have been considered recently in the literature for related problems , like bandwidth allocation in cellular networks  @xcite . from an engineering point of view , we have already shown a successful application of our model to find efficient frequency assignments in wireless surveillance sensor networks  @xcite . from a mathematical point of view , the present paper explores two new problems , showing their complexity , providing theoretical bounds , and proposing and testing a heuristic .",
    "first , we introduce the problem which fits that of wifi channel assignment , called the threshold spectrum coloring ( tsc ) problem : given a graph  @xmath0 and a spectrum of  @xmath8 colors ( channels ) , endowed with a @xmath9 matrix  @xmath2 of interferences between them , the goal is to determine the minimum threshold  @xmath10 such that @xmath4 admits a @xmath8-coloring  @xmath5 in which the interference at every vertex is at most  @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "such a minimum  @xmath11 will be called the _ minimum @xmath8-chromatic threshold _ of  @xmath4 , denoted as  @xmath13 .",
    "then , since the tsc problem fixes the parameter  @xmath8 and aims to minimize the parameter  @xmath11 , it is natural to wonder about the complementary problem : in the chromatic spectrum coloring ( csc ) problem , a threshold @xmath10 is fixed and the spectrum is let to have size the number @xmath14 of vertices , the goal being to determine the minimum number of colors ( channels )  @xmath15 such that @xmath4 admits a @xmath8-coloring  @xmath5 in which the interference at every vertex is at most that threshold  @xmath11 .",
    "such a minimum  @xmath8 will be called the _ @xmath11-interference chromatic number _ of  @xmath4 , denoted as  @xmath16 .",
    "this csc problem has also a tranlation in the context of frequency assignment : it aims to compute the minimum number of frequencies ( colors ) that guarantee a minimum throughput to every user in the network , so it can be seen as the problem of determining the number of resources required to provide a certain quality of service .",
    "the remainder of this section presents a case study to illustrate both problems , along with a discussion of relevant related work .",
    "section 2 is devoted to theoretical results , showing that both problems are np - hard and proving upper bounds for the solutions to each problem .",
    "section 3 completes the scene with experimental results , proposing a dsatur - based heuristic for each problem and comparing them with selected reference approaches .",
    "finally , section 4 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "let us illustrate these two problems by analyzing an easy , but non - trivial , example using the paw graph  @xmath17  @xcite , see figure  1 ( right ) .",
    "for the tsc problem , consider an spectrum of @xmath18 colors @xmath19 , endowed with the @xmath20 matrix of interferences with exponential decay of base  @xmath21 , @xmath22 see figure  [ fig : totalinterferencecoloring ] ( left ) for an illustration .     and the interferences it induces on the different possible colorings of an edge .",
    "right : all proper 3-colorings of the paw graph and the interferences they induce at every vertex .",
    "highlighted colorings achieve interference  @xmath23 at every vertex . ]    in this tsc problem , we have a fixed number of colors  @xmath8 and we want to find the smallest possible interference threshold  @xmath11 .",
    "figure  [ fig : totalinterferencecoloring ] , right , shows all the proper ( without monochromatic edges ) @xmath24-colorings of the paw graph , together with the interference  @xmath25 at every vertex  @xmath6 .",
    "observe that the highlighted colorings achieve interference at most  @xmath26 at every vertex .",
    "this is impossible for improper colorings , since the matrix  @xmath2 assigns interference  @xmath27 to monochromatic edges which , therefore , will lead to one of its endpoints having interference greater than  @xmath27 .    let us show now that , in this setting , no coloring can achieve a maximum vertex interference  @xmath11 strictly smaller than  @xmath27 : focus on the central vertex of the paw graph and observe that , according to the matrix  @xmath28 , that vertex can only achieve an interference smaller than  @xmath27 if it is colored red and its neighbors are colored blue , or vice versa .",
    "but this gives rise to a monochromatic edge between the left vertices of the paw , which implies interference greater than  @xmath27 at those two vertices .",
    "see figure  [ fig : exampletsc ] .    .",
    "]    therefore , we have solved the corresponding tsc problem , proving that for the paw graph  @xmath17 with @xmath18 colors and a matrix  @xmath28 with exponential decay of base  @xmath21 , the minimum chromatic threshold  @xmath11 achievable is  @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath29    for the csc problem , we let the size of the spectrum equal the number of vertices , which is four in the paw graph  @xmath17 .",
    "consider for example  @xmath30 , also endowed with the matrix of interferences with exponential decay of base  @xmath21 , in this case of size @xmath31 ,    @xmath32    in this setting , we can fix an interference threshold  @xmath26 and we aim to find the smallest number  @xmath8 of colors for which such a threshold is achievable .",
    "the discussion above for the previous problem shows that the threshold  @xmath26 can be achieved with three of those colors , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "we now show that such a threshold is impossible to achieve with only @xmath33 colors among the four colors available : focus again on the central vertex of the paw graph  @xmath17 .",
    "if it has a neighbor with its same color , then a monochromatic edge arises and , as above , this implies the interference at some vertex being greater than one .",
    "if the central vertex has no neighbor with its same color , then all its neighbors share a common color , so that again a monochromatic edge arises and there is a vertex with interference greater than one .",
    "see figure  [ fig : examplecsc ] .",
    "colors among the  @xmath34 colors available . ]",
    "therefore , we have solved the corresponding csc problem proving that , for the paw graph  @xmath17 with threshold @xmath26 and a matrix  @xmath28 with exponential decay of base  @xmath21 , the interference chromatic number is  @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath35      araujo et al .",
    "@xcite consider a weight function  @xmath36 on the edges of the graph  @xmath0 instead of a matrix  @xmath2 of interferences between colors , defining the interference at a vertex to be the sum of weights of incident monochromatic edges .",
    "although they bounds are similar to ours , using the same techniques , we further show tightness and follow a different , more detailed , scheme .",
    "many other works impose conditions to the colors of the endpoints of any edge .",
    "most of them can be framed into _ @xmath37-labellings _",
    "@xcite , where vertices at distance  @xmath38 must get colors at distance  @xmath39 .",
    "particular instances include _ distance coloring _",
    "@xcite , where no two vertices at distance  @xmath40 can have the same color , _ @xmath41-coloring _",
    "@xcite , where adjacent vertices must get colors  @xmath42 apart and vertices at distance  @xmath43 must get different colors , as well as",
    "_ @xmath44-labellings _",
    "@xcite , where adjacent vertices must get colors  @xmath45 apart and vertices at distance  @xmath21 must get colors  @xmath46 apart .    for a different setting , in a _ bandwidth coloring _  @xcite a distance  @xmath47 is associated to each particular edge  @xmath48 , forcing its endpoints to get colors  @xmath49 apart .",
    "a similar flavor has the _ @xmath50-coloring _",
    "@xcite , where adjacent vertices must get colors whose distance is not in a prescribed set  @xmath50 , and the _ @xmath51-coloring _",
    "@xcite , where the vertices have to be partitioned into sets with prescribed pairwise distances .    of independent interest",
    "are the works on the frequency assignment problem , which use different models to fit the characteristics of specific applications .",
    "the bibliography about this problem is too extensive to include here even a selection .",
    "instead , we prefer referring the reader to the comprehensive survey by aardal et al .  @xcite .",
    "the well - known vertex coloring ( vc ) problem , which aims for a proper coloring ( with no monochromatic edges ) is a particular case of our chromatic spectrum coloring problem , using the identity  @xmath52 as matrix of weights and a threshold @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , the usual chromatic number is the @xmath54-interference chromatic number of  @xmath55 , that is , @xmath56 with the same identity matrix and a threshold  @xmath11 , we get the improper coloring problem , which allows at most  @xmath11 monochromatic edges around a vertex .",
    "these two particular cases are np - hard  @xcite , hence so is our chromatic spectrum coloring problem .",
    "in addition , fixed any @xmath57 it is np - complete to decide if there exists a @xmath8-coloring with interference at most any threshold  @xmath58 , see  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "this implies that our threshold spectrum coloring is also np - hard .",
    "let us formally state these two results :    [ theorem : complexity ] the chromatic spectrum coloring and the threshold spectrum coloring problems are np - hard .      in this subsection",
    "we prove theoretical upper bounds for the goal of the tsc problem , the minimum @xmath8-chromatic threshold  @xmath13 , and for the aim of the csc problem , the @xmath11-interference chromatic number  @xmath16 .    given a graph  @xmath0 , a matrix  @xmath2 , and a coloring  @xmath5 , we denote the _ potential interference _ at vertex  @xmath6 if this vertex had color  @xmath38 as @xmath59 note that for  @xmath38 the actual color of  @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath60 , we get the actual interference at vertex  @xmath6 , that is , @xmath61 .",
    "a @xmath8-coloring  @xmath5 of  @xmath0 will be said to be _",
    "@xmath2-balanced _ if , for every vertex , the actual interference is not greater than any of the potential interferences , i.e. , if for every vertex  @xmath6 we have @xmath62 for all @xmath63 .",
    "we first prove that balanced colorings do exist :    [ proposition : balancedcoloring ] given a graph  @xmath0 and a spectrum  @xmath51 of size @xmath64 endowed with a matrix  @xmath2 of interferences , there exists a @xmath2-balanced coloring of  @xmath0 .",
    "let  @xmath52 be the sum of edge - interferences for the current coloring  @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath65 ( note that this is actually half of the sum of interferences at every vertex . ) observe that any coloring achieving the minimum for this sum of edge - interferences will be a @xmath2-balanced coloring of  @xmath0 : if there is a current interference  @xmath66 which is greater than a potential interference  @xmath67 , then recoloring would lead to a smaller sum  @xmath52 of edge - interferences .",
    "furthermore , we can prove that such a balanced coloring can be found by a random greedy algorithm : start with a random coloring of the graph  @xmath68 and , if there exist a vertex @xmath69 and a color  @xmath70 such that the potential interference  @xmath71 for that color is smaller than the current interference  @xmath72 , then recolor the vertex  @xmath6 with color  @xmath73 and repeat .",
    "each step of the procedure increases  @xmath52 by @xmath71 and decreases  @xmath52 by @xmath72 ( in both cases , @xmath5 is the initial coloring before the step ) .",
    "hence , the sum of edge - interferences  @xmath52 decreases by a positive amount @xmath74 and the random greedy algorithm finishes with a @xmath2-balanced coloring of  @xmath0 .    before proving our bounds , we also need the following lemma :    [ lemma : balanced ] any @xmath2-balanced @xmath8-coloring  @xmath5 of a graph  @xmath0 fulfills that , for each vertex  @xmath6 , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the natural norm of the matrix  @xmath2 .",
    "first , observe that such a coloring fulfills @xmath77 because @xmath5 being balanced implies that the interference @xmath72 is actually not greater than all of the potential interferences @xmath71 .",
    "restating the sum of the potential interferences at  @xmath6 as the sum of interferences contributed by neighbors of each color while varying the color of  @xmath6 , the right - hand side in the previous equation equals @xmath78 and this sum is not greater than the number of neighbors of  @xmath6 times the maximum of the sums @xmath79 , i.e. , not greater than @xmath80 .",
    "now we are ready to prove an upper bound for the aim of the tsc problem :    [ theorem : tscbound ] given a graph  @xmath0 and a spectrum  @xmath51 of size @xmath81 endowed with a matrix  @xmath2 of interferences , for any fixed natural number  @xmath82 , the following bound holds for the minimum @xmath8-chromatic threshold  @xmath13 : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the maximum vertex - degree in the graph  @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , this bound is as tight as it can be , i.e. , there are instances of  @xmath85 for which the bound is tight .    by definition of  @xmath13 , in order to prove the bound it is enough to prove that there exists a coloring  @xmath86 of  @xmath0 with  @xmath8 colors for which the interference at every vertex does not exceed the threshold  @xmath87 .",
    "because of proposition  [ proposition : balancedcoloring ] and @xmath57 , we know that there exists a @xmath2-balanced coloring  @xmath86 of  @xmath0 using  @xmath8 colors .",
    "it just remains to prove the interference condition . for every vertex  @xmath6 with maximum interference",
    "we have @xmath88 where the leftmost inequality follows from @xmath13 being minimum and the rightmost inequality comes from lemma  [ lemma : balanced ] . the bound in the statement follows .    for the final claim in the statement , it is enough to note that taking @xmath33 and @xmath89 our bound results in @xmath90 , which is tight for the graph  @xmath0 being a cycle of odd length . in that case",
    "it is not possible to avoid monochromatic edges , with the best coloring achieving a single monochromatic edge and , therefore , a smallest threshold of  @xmath27 , which matches the bound @xmath91 .",
    "next , we provide an upper bound for the aim of the csc problem .",
    "the bound uses the generalization of the greatest common divisor ( gcd ) to non - integer numbers , which is defined analogously just considering that a number  @xmath92 divides a number  @xmath93 if the fraction  @xmath94 is an integer .    [",
    "theorem : cscbound ] given a graph  @xmath0 and a spectrum  @xmath51 of size @xmath64 endowed with a matrix  @xmath2 of interferences , for any fixed threshold  @xmath11 being a multiple of  @xmath95 and such that @xmath96 the following bound holds for the @xmath11-interference chromatic number  @xmath16 : @xmath97 if @xmath11 is not a multiple of  @xmath95 , the bound can be expressed as @xmath98 where  @xmath11 is replaced by the nearest multiple of  @xmath95 below  @xmath11 .    furthermore , these bounds are as tight as they can be , i.e. , there are instances of @xmath99 for which the bounds are tight .",
    "the number of colors has to be at least one and the bound is trivially satisfied for @xmath100 , so let us focus on the case @xmath101 .",
    "we start with the case of  @xmath11 being a multiple of  @xmath95 .    by definition of  @xmath16 , in order to prove the bound it is enough to prove that there exists a coloring  @xmath86 of  @xmath0 with @xmath102 colors for which the interference at every vertex does not exceed the threshold  @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath103 .",
    "note that the condition on  @xmath11 in the statement ensures that @xmath104 .",
    "because of proposition  [ proposition : balancedcoloring ] and @xmath105 , we know that there exists a @xmath2-balanced coloring  @xmath86 of  @xmath0 using  @xmath106 colors .",
    "hence , it just remains to prove the interference condition .    by contradiction ,",
    "suppose that for the coloring  @xmath86 there is a vertex  @xmath6 in  @xmath0 with an interference above the threshold  @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath107 which , because of  @xmath11 and the interferences around a vertex being multiples of  @xmath95 , implies @xmath108 then , since the coloring  @xmath86 is balanced , lemma  [ lemma : balanced ] leads to @xmath109 where the leftmost inequality follows from the definition of  @xmath84 .",
    "but then our choice of  @xmath106 implies that @xmath110 which is a contradiction .",
    "the same arguments work for the case of  @xmath11 not being a multiple of  @xmath95 , taking into account that interferences around a vertex have to be multiples of  @xmath95 . for the final claim in the statement ,",
    "it is enough to take @xmath89 and @xmath53 ( which is possible as long as @xmath111 , i.e. , the coloring is not forced to be improper ) .",
    "thus , our bound coincides with brooks bound  @xcite for the chromatic number @xmath112 , which is tight for the graph  @xmath0 being a cycle of odd length .",
    "[ obs : boundscasestudy ] the reader can check that the case analyzed in subsection  [ subsec : casestudy ] does fulfill the bounds in theorems  [ theorem : tscbound ] and  [ theorem : cscbound ] . respectively : @xmath113 and @xmath114 note that , in this case , the small size of the graph makes the upper bound  @xmath115 exceed the actual size of the spectrum  @xmath116 , because the chosen threshold @xmath26 does not fulfill the condition in the statement of theorem  [ theorem : cscbound ] : @xmath117    [ obs : extendspectrum ] theorem  [ theorem : cscbound ] is still useful for values of the threshold  @xmath11 not fulfilling the condition in the statement . if we were allowed to extend the spectrum  @xmath51 in such a way that ( i ) the bound given in the theorem",
    "is now below the size  @xmath81 and ( ii ) neither  @xmath118 nor  @xmath95 are increased , then the threshold  @xmath11 would fulfill the condition .",
    "thus , we would get not only an upper bound for the @xmath11-interference chromatic number , but also a certificate that for such a  @xmath11 the problem would be solvable for the extended spectrum .",
    "it is interesting to point up that , as long as the size of the spectrum is large enough for the chosen threshold , our bounds do not depend on the number of vertices in the graph  @xmath0 , but only on its maximum degree  @xmath84 .",
    "for the sake of applications to wifi channel assignment , this guarantees the scalability of the bounds for a growing number of aps as long as the maximum number of interfering aps can be restrained .",
    "such a property has interesting implications in the design and planning of wireless networks infrastructures , since the transmitting power of the aps could be adjusted to guarantee that the degree of the graph stays below the necessary value , and therefore , to satisfy the maximum interference threshold for a given performance requirement .",
    "the np - hard vertex coloring ( vc ) problem turns out to be considerably challenging , with exact methods suffering from the difficulty of proving that there is no better coloring than the one found by the method .",
    "this hardness has given rise to many heuristics and metaheuristics for different vertex - coloring problems , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "since the threshold spectrum coloring ( tsc ) and chromatic spectrum coloring ( csc ) problems introduced in this paper are also np - hard , as stated in theorem  [ theorem : complexity ] , this section is devoted to test several techniques , in a range of scenarios , to compare their performance for the tsc and csc problems .",
    "in addition , we check the gap between the experimental results obtained and the theoretical upper bounds given by theorems  [ theorem : tscbound ] and  [ theorem : cscbound ] .",
    "we have considered graphs generated randomly using the erds - renyi ( er ) model  @xcite . in these graphs ,",
    "every pair of vertices has a prescribed probability  @xmath119 of being connected .",
    "different sub - categories have been created by varying the number of vertices @xmath120 and the probability of connection @xmath119 . in particular",
    ", we generated 10 graphs for each combination of the same settings used in @xcite , that is , number of vertices @xmath121 and probability of connection @xmath122 , performing 20 repetitions of each experiment per graph .",
    "for the matrix of interferences between colors , we have considered the exponential decay of base  @xmath21 already used in subsection  [ subsec : casestudy ] , @xmath123 .    for the tsc problem",
    "we have considered @xmath124 as values for the number of colors in the spectrum , while for the csc problem we have considered thresholds @xmath125 , being  @xmath126 the expected average degree of the graph .",
    "these choices have a twofold interest : on one hand , because of including the number @xmath127 of channels available in the wifi problem , so that our results show interference thresholds that can be achieved at every vertex . on the other hand , because the choices for  @xmath8 turn out to be similar to the best number of colors obtained for the chosen values of  @xmath11 and vice versa .      for an experimental analysis of our two problems , we propose heuristics which adapt the sequential greedy algorithm dsatur  @xcite used for the vertex coloring problem .",
    "our implementation tsc - dsatur for the threshold spectrum coloring problem looks for the color minimizing the interference at  @xmath6 , as shown in algorithm [ alg : tsc - dsatur ] .",
    "the algorithm starts with an undefined coloring  ( 1 ) and iterates by selecting at each iteration the uncolored vertex with the highest saturation degree , that is , the one with more already - colored neighbors , the one with highest degree in the case of a tie , or a random vertex among the highest - degree vertices in the case of a double tie  ( 2 ) .",
    "once a vertex @xmath6 has been selected , a color is assigned from the available set so that the interference at vertex  @xmath6 is minimized  ( 3 ) .",
    "@xmath128 ; +    our implementation csc - dsatur for the chromatic spectrum coloring problem is shown in algorithm [ alg : csc - dsatur ] .",
    "the algorithm looks for a color that does not make interference at  @xmath6 exceed the product of the fixed threshold  @xmath11 by the proportion of neighbors already colored  ( 1 ) .",
    "that is , if vertex  @xmath6 has five neighbours , but only three of them have been colored so far , the color chosen should guarantee the interference at  @xmath6 to be at most  @xmath129 . for a color to be chosen , this constraint must hold not only for  @xmath6 , but also for any neighbor of  @xmath6 which has already been colored  ( 2 ) .",
    "this is a conservative heuristic to ensure it is not possible to have a solution where the maximum interference per vertex is above the threshold .",
    "@xmath128 ; +    in addition , for our two problems we have also tested a generic nonlinear optimizer based in harmony search , a music - inspired , evolutionary optimization algorithm @xcite that makes use of augmented lagrangian multipliers to handle constraints  @xcite .",
    "for the tsc problem , we have used the _ sum _ of the interferences per vertex as the objective function , since our experiments proved that alhso performed significantly worse when using the maximum interference per vertex .",
    "this is due to the fact that alhso works better when optimizing a function with smooth gradients , and this is better achieved using the sum rather than using the maximum .",
    "for the csc problem , we have used the same alhso optimizer as for tsc in an iterative manner , progressively increasing the number of colors @xmath8 from one to @xmath130 , until we get a solution whose maximum interference per vertex is below the threshold  @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , as a baseline reference , we have evaluated a _",
    "random _ coloring approach , which simply selects the color for each vertex from a uniform distribution on the color set .",

    "in particular , our results for tsc with @xmath127 colors have a direct application to the wifi channel assignment problem , allowing to obtain an interference threshold which can be ensured to be achievable at every vertex .",
    "furthermore , the experiments show that the performance of our heuristics tsc - dsatur and csc - dsatur is similar to that of alhso , being slightly better for lower values of  @xmath119 and slightly worse as the complexity of the graph increases .",
