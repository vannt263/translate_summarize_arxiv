    "measures of complexity are central to the investigation of complex networks @xcite in social , technological and biological contexts .",
    "these measures allow us to capture differences and similarities between networks appearing in vastly different contexts , which furthers our understanding of the information encoded in complex networks . in particular ,",
    "following @xcite one may define the complexity of a network as a summary of the underlying graph structure .",
    "consequently , the presence of hierarchical organization @xcite or a scaling behavior of the degree distribution @xcite are examples of structural features that contribute to the complexity .    recently ,",
    "following information theoretical and statistical mechanics paradigms , several _ entropic _ measures for complexity @xcite have been proposed for network structure .",
    "these measures have been shown to be extremely successful in quantifying the level of organization encoded in structural features of networks @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the relationship between the different entropic measures remains an open question . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we found insightful connections between the von neumann and the shannon entropy .",
    "the shannon entropy @xmath0 of a network ensemble is proportional to the logarithm of a typical network in the ensemble . as such",
    ", the shannon entropy of all networks with given structural constraints has the clear interpretation of quantifying the information present in network structures .",
    "the smaller is the entropy of an ensemble , the stronger are the limitations imposed by the constraints and , in some sense , the more optimized is the network .",
    "it turns out that the shannon entropy of an ensemble depends on the _ number _ of constraints that are imposed .",
    "in particular , more constraints imply a smaller entropy .",
    "additionally , the entropy also qualitatively depends on the _ type _ of constraints .",
    "for example , the entropy of scale - free networks @xcite is much smaller than the entropy of networks with exponential degree distribution also if in both cases only the degree distribution of the network is fixed .",
    "this result is able , for example , to quantify how much more information is encoded in such scale - free networks respect to networks with other degree distributions .    the von neumann entropy of a network , @xmath1 , was previously introduced by braunstein , ghosh , and severini @xcite and later discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this quantity is determined by the spectrum of the graph laplacian @xmath2 of the network .",
    "specifically , considering networks with @xmath3 nodes and an average degree of @xmath4 , we have that @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "the authors of @xcite demonstrate that the von neumann entropy may be seen as a measure of regularity in networks , i.e. , regular graphs with an equal number of neighbors for all nodes tend to display a higher entropy than those with heterogeneous degree distributions and the same number of links .",
    "since @xmath2 has eigenvalues @xmath7 , for @xmath8 and at least one eigenvalue is equal to zero , the maximum of the von neumann entropy is reached when all other eigenvalues are equal and hence @xmath9 .",
    "this bound is also saturated by random graphs in the asymptotic limit @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we explore in greater detail the relation between the shannon and von neumann entropies , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively for an ensemble of networks with hidden variables that fix the degree sequence .",
    "our results indicate that for the canonical ensemble of exponential random network , in the limit of large @xmath3 , the entropy @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "this rule holds irrespective of the scaling of the average degree @xmath4 , and the degree distribution which are responsible for the sub - leading corrections .",
    "moreover , as soon as we introduce heterogeneity in the expected degree of individual nodes , the von neumann entropy correlates with the shannon entropy in a non - trival manner .",
    "the heterogeneity of expected degrees induces an intriguing relation between the quantum description of the network captured by the von neumann entropy and the classical description of the networks .",
    "it has been already shown that growing complex networks with heterogeneous feature of the nodes show in their evolution some sort of quantum effects @xcite , in the sense that the evolution of these networks is described well by quantum statistics .",
    "here we observe that the simple heterogeneity in the degrees induces a correlation between essentially classical and quantum measures of complexity of the networks .",
    "it may be valuable to interpret this fact with particular attention to the classical - quantum interface .",
    "the suggestion arising from our discussion tells in some way that mixed quantum systems , consisting of ensembles composed by many pure states , have a more classical nature when their von neumann entropy correlates to the shannon entropy . in our case",
    ", this is exactly when there is some `` extra amount of disorder '' introduced at the degree level .",
    "the hypothesis opens a scenario to further investigate this kind of correlation , with the purpose to study properties of the transition from quantum to classical physics , at least when considering large ensembles of two - level states .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we define and evaluate the shannon entropy for networks ensemble with expected average degree sequence . in sec .",
    "iii , we define the von neumann entropy of networks in terms of the laplacian spectra . in sec .",
    "iv , we we show how the laplacian spectra can be calulated by the cavity methods . in sec .",
    "v , we compute the lapalcian spectra of dense networks . in sec .",
    "vi , we use the effective medium approximation for the spectra or sparse networks . finally , in sec .",
    "vii we show that the shannon entropy and the von neumann entropy of networks with heterogeneous degree distribution correlate in the cases of dense and sparse network ensembles .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "in general , the entropy is defined as the logarithm of the number of networks in the ensemble .",
    "one distinguishes between two types of ensembles ; ( i ) the micro - canonical ensemble , where structural features ",
    "constraints  are satisfied by all networks in the ensemble .",
    "the @xmath11 model @xcite from the theory of random graphs is a simple example of a micro - canonical ensemble of networks with @xmath3 nodes , where we dictate that the total number of links is @xmath12 .",
    "the entropy for the micro - canonical ensemble may also be computed via combinatorial methods .",
    "( ii ) one also defines canonical ensembles , where constraints are satisfied _ on average_. the complement of the @xmath11 ensemble is the @xmath13 model , which corresponds to the canonical ensemble of networks with @xmath3 nodes and a fixed probability @xmath14 for a link to be present .",
    "the total number of links @xmath12 in the @xmath13 ensemble is poisson distributed with average @xmath15 .",
    "the parallel between microcanonical and canonical network ensembles can be extended to include more general community , structural and even spatial constraints @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the canonical ensemble with fixed expected degree sequence , which is the conjugated canonical ensemble of the configuration model where the degree sequence is fixed .",
    "this ensembles is also known as the _ hidden variable ensembles _ and thse have been studied both by statisticians and physicists @xcite    a network belonging to the canonical ensemble of _ uncorrelated network _ with fixed expected degree sequence may be constructed as follows :    * for each node @xmath16 , draw its expected degree @xmath17 from the probability distribution @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the upper bound condition for the @xmath17 ensures that they remain uncorrelated across nodes . * between nodes @xmath16 and @xmath21 we add a link with probability @xmath22    in the large network limit @xmath23 the degree @xmath24 of each node @xmath16 in this ensemble is given by a poisson variable with mean and variance equal to @xmath17",
    ". therefore also the total number of links is a poisson variable with average @xmath25 .",
    "it follows that the average degree of each network realization is a self - averaging quantity for networks in which @xmath26 , i.e. the expected degree converges in probability to a delta distribution peaked at the expected average degree ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the entropy of canonical network ensembles is readily obtained from an appropriate definition of the ensemble @xcite .",

    "in quantum mechanics , a _",
    "mixed state _ is a statistical mixture of _ pure states_. these are represented by rays in hilbert space and correspond to the maximum knowledge which can be acquired about the system .",
    "mathematically , each quantum state is described by a _ density matrix _ , _",
    "i.e. _ a positive semidefinite , trace - one , symmetric matrix . the density matrix of a system with hilbert space @xmath43 is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a real weight from a probability distribution and @xmath46 is the projector corresponding to the pure state @xmath47 . in words ,",
    "each density matrix represents a convex combination of pure states , which are then the extremal points of the set .    the amount of mixedness  of a quantum state is given by the von neumann entropy , which , in this sense , can be seen as the quantum analogue of the shannon entropy @xcite . in information - theoretic terms",
    ", the von neumann entropy quantifies the incompressible information content of a quantum source , where the signal is given by pure states ; the entropy of a pure state is zero .",
    "additionally , it has an important operational meaning , being the unique measure of bipartite entanglement in pure states , via the notion of a reduced density operator .",
    "the connection between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics is expressed by the fact that @xmath48 is invariant under schrdinger evolution , for systems completely isolated from the environment . indeed , entropy increases with measurement processes , but @xmath49 for any unitary operator @xmath50 .",
    "the definition of @xmath0 suggests a direct way to associate a quantum state to a network , by making use of the graph laplacian .",
    "importantly , the invariance under unitary operators guarantees invariance under graph isomorphism . a discrete analogue of the laplace - beltrami operator , the graph laplacian is a positive semidefinite symmetric matrix .",
    "once normalized in appropriate way , it can be treated as a density matrix .",

    "we construct the graph _ laplacian _ @xmath2 where @xmath53}\\,k_i\\,-\\,a_{ij}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 .",
    "the laplacian operator appears quite frequently in the study of diffusion @xcite , resonance in electric circuits @xcite , and certainly in a myriad of applications in combinatorics and computer science @xcite .",
    "we associate to each node of the network a state in the standard basis of an hilbert space of dimension @xmath55 : @xmath56 corresponds to a pure state @xmath57 .",
    "the associated density matrix is @xmath58 the density matrix of the pure state @xmath57 corresponds to the laplacian of a graph with a single link and with @xmath59 nodes of degree zero , being @xmath3 the dimension of the space .",
    "the density matrix @xmath60 is a pure state .",
    "taking equal weights @xmath61 depending on the number of edges , the matrix @xmath62is just the laplacian of the graph , but adjusted to have unit trace .",
    "in this expression , the weights may be chosen arbitrarily , with the only constraint @xmath63 .",
    "since the smallest eigenvalue of the laplacian is zero , we expect that @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "the maximum @xmath1 is attained by the complete graph on @xmath3 nodes , and in the thermodynamic limit by any poisson random graph @xcite .",
    "the minimum is clearly for pure states .",
    "the von neumann entropy on suitable rotation of the laplacian matrix about its eigenvector basis can be expressed as @xmath65 where the term @xmath66 denotes the density of eigenvalue state @xmath67 of the laplacian .",
    "therefore the von neumann entropy has a leading term of order @xmath68 and a subleading terms determined by the spectrum of the laplacian .",
    "apart from issues arising from cospectrality , where nonisomorphic graph can have the same entropy , it is also worth observing that the expansion properties of the graph do not seem to be responsible for the behaviour of the entropy , since the fact that the eigenvalue gap compresses  the eigenvalues towards zero does not have other direct implications .",
    "in fact we observe that the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "@xmath69 is dominated by the behavior of the density of states @xmath66 for large values of the eigenvalues @xmath67 s .",
    "therefore , the large eigenvalues of the graph laplacian , that determine the fast temporal scales of the diffusion dynamics on the network , gives the largest contribution to the von neumann entropy .",
    "the von neumann entropy is defined on every single graph .",
    "nevertheless , it is instructing to evaluate the von neumann entropy of ensembles of graphs with different degree distribution .",
    "this helps to understand the impact of the heterogeneity of the network on this new quantity relating networks to quantum states . in canonical network ensembles",
    "the laplacian spectra is self - averaging as long as @xmath70 , meaning that the spectra of a network of this ensemble will approach the average spectra of the network in the ensemble in the large @xmath3 limit .",
    "we note also that since in the canonical ensemble the average degree @xmath4 is a self - averaging quantity , the von neumann entropy of large networks in the canonical network ensembles can be written also as @xmath71",
