    "fissured media are common geological structures . in such a medium ,",
    "fast flow occurs on the cracks while the rock matrix constitutes the slow flow region .",
    "the associated transport phenomenon has been extensively studied from several points of view and at different scales of modeling due to its remarkable importance in different fields such as : oil extraction , water supply , pollution of subsurface streams and soils , waste management , etc .",
    "several models of coupled systems of partial differential equations have been proposed , such as double @xcite and multiple porosity systems @xcite , microstructure models @xcite and the coupling of laws at different scales : see @xcite for an analytic approach of a darcy - stokes system and see @xcite for a numerical treatment of a darcy - brinkman system .",
    "in addition , various numerical @xcite or numerical / analytical @xcite works have dealt with the discretization and numerical aspects of the proposed models .    for small values of the reynolds number ,",
    "the saturated flow within the fissures is predominantly parallel to the surface hosting it .",
    "this fact has been mathematically shown in @xcite using homogenization techniques and in @xcite via asymptotic analysis .",
    "assuming further that fissures are thin enough as to forgo any transverse variation of velocities , and that the surrounding rock matrix is impermeable , two degrees of freedom at each point remain to be resolved for a complete identification of the velocity field .",
    "another important aspect is that surveys of fissured media at the field scale are usually performed at discrete ( albeit numerous ) sampling points ( see @xcite for an imaging method ) .",
    "the three - dimensional geometry of the fissure is then usually modeled as a triangulated surface with nodes located on points of known coordinates . for physical processes that depend on the fissure",
    "s geometry like fluid flow , it is therefore desirable to construct models that yield approximate solutions at the resolution of the triangulated surface .",
    "the considerations laid out in the previous paragraph encompass the main motivation for the present work .",
    "our starting point is the darcy s equation for the two - dimensional flow velocity and pressure on the region of the x - y plane limited by the fissure .",
    "this approach is hence limited to fissures whose three - dimensional triangulated surface can be orthogonally projected onto a triangulated region of the x - y plane in a biunivoque way .",
    "the flow is driven by the gravitational potential and a prescribed external pressure potential along the domain .",
    "we then compute a conservative two - dimensional velocity field that is piece - wise constant on the triangulation elements , and that best approximates the solution to the discretized darcy s equation . by conservative in this context , we mean a velocity field for which the net discharge along each element boundary vanishes .",
    "the final step in the construction is a lifting operation , again conservative , yielding the corresponding three - dimensional velocity field everywhere parallel to the triangulated surface .",
    "the main feature of the proposed model is its simplicity . through the action of linear operators",
    "whose dimension is comparable to the number of elements in the triangulation , our methodology yields approximate streamlines which are parallel among them within each triangle , and everywhere parallel to the triangulated surface .",
    "we present two applications of the proposed model aimed at quantifying the fissure s geometry effect on flow and transport .",
    "first we consider the problem of dispersion of a tracer that is being advected within the fissure by the constructed velocity field .",
    "the evolution of the concentration of the tracer can be characterized in discrete time by a linear operator which is explicitly derived here . as a second application",

    "the two examples below correspond to different surfaces , in each case we perform two experiments , one with a null pressure potential , i.e. , @xmath301 and the other with a logarithmic pressure potential @xmath302 , corresponding to a well centered at the point @xmath303 ; notice that the pressure potential is the fundamental solution of the 2-d laplace equation at the point @xmath304 . for the graphics , we display side by side the potentials @xmath305 , @xmath306 , below each other the associated conservative flow fields are depicted and finally , the corresponding expected boundary reaching times per element are shown .",
    "the experiments are executed in a matlab script and use a delaunay triangulation , composed of 322 elements for the first example and 1046 elements for the second example , where the vertices were generated randomly .    due to the scales of the phenomenon we choose the cgs system of units , for both examples",
    "we choose the values : water density @xmath307 , gravity @xmath308 , water layer thickness @xmath309 , darcy - weishbach coefficient @xmath310 and flow resistance @xmath311 , the geometric domain is the unit square i.e. , @xmath312^{2}$ ] .",
    "in contrast , the numerical values describing the overall behavior of the surface , displayed in tables [ tb example 1 ] , [ tb example 2 ] of examples [ ex verification example ] and [ ex exploration example ] respectively , are presented in the cgs system , due to its scale .",
    "these values are the average velocity @xmath313 $ ] , the energy losses @xmath298 , @xmath299 , @xmath300 and the average expected time ( average of the elements expected time ) , denoted by @xmath314 $ ] .",
    "we also stress that in this context , positive amounts of energy indicate dissipation , while a negative sign means that such quantity is still available in the form of kinetic energy .    [ ex verification example ]",
    "the first example is for verification purposes .",
    "the surface is given by the plane @xmath315 , @xmath316 .",
    "for the first experiment we set @xmath317 and for the second , a pressure potential @xmath318 i.e. , an extraction well beyond the upper left corner of the graphic .",
    "notice that both potentials are harmonic functions ( see figures [ fig surface and time expected ex 1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) respectively ) , therefore the master velocity fields are a multiple the corresponding gradients and the global conservative fields are the lifting of such gradients multiplied by @xmath319 .",
    "these facts can be observed on figures [ fig surface and time expected ex 1 ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "also notice that the expected boundary reaching times are consistent with the a - priori intuitive notion as figures [ fig surface and time expected ex 1 ] ( e ) and ( f ) show .",
    "the next table summarizes the overall behavior of the surface for both potentials .",
    ".example [ ex verification example ] : energy dissipation table , 322 elements . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we summarize in the table [ tb example 2 ] below the overall behavior of the surface for both potentials .",
    "again it follows that for both potentials , dominant effect is the gravity . in the f",
    "the order of scales states that @xmath320 . in the second case",
    "the well pulls the flow uphill towards the highest point consequently , the value of @xmath300 contracts around 45 percent , while @xmath298 and @xmath300 increase drastically around 300 and 100 percent respectively but preserving the same order of scales @xmath320 .",
    "it also follows that the increase of these two effect come from the fact that the new stream lines travel along more curved and therefore longer paths .",
    "finally , it is observed that the average expected reaching time decreases in only 10 percent from the first to the second case ; although there are now two main evacuation points , the top point demands more travel time due to the increase in the length of the stream lines and the magnitudes of the flow field .",
    "+        +",
    "the present work yields several conclusions listed below    a.   we proposed a method aimed to describe the flow on the fissures embedded in a porous medium and also to measure its impact in terms of energy dissipation and transport phenomena .",
    "b.   unlike previous achievements , the present work is capable of describing explicitly the flow field on the fissure under mild hypotheses .",
    "moreover , here the geometry of the manifold plays a central role for the quantifications we seek . c.   our approach is consistent and applicable to real case scenarios as pointed out in the introduction , because the available data for geological structures are discrete , therefore and interpolation process has to be done and the uncertainty coming from the knowledge of the geometry needs to be accounted for .",
    "d.   the proposed method is remarkably simple as it is in essence a composition of linear operators and yet it computes accurately the analyzed phenomena and can be extended to other physical aspects .",
    "this simplicity is precisely its main fortitude because it makes it computationally efficient and thus fit for large scale computations , when it comes to simulate highly fractured media .",
    "e.   the values of energy dissipation may not seem important in the presented experiments and they are of lower order scale with respect to the gravity however , at the field scale this effects become important as they add up the losses from a large number of extended fissures .",
    "in addition the average velocity for a given surface @xmath321 $ ] defines what would the preferential flow direction of the medium would be , should there be only one embedded fissure .",
    "it follows that for a highly fractured medium the preferential flow direction ( see @xcite for a different approach ) is determined by the mean flow directions of each surface weighted vs. the corresponding discharge rate they host , relative to the total discharge rate along the cracks network .",
    "f.   a natural question would be the extension of the method to a different interpolation method for the geometry , e.g. using splines rather than linear affine functions .",
    "however , this approach introduces a lot of computational complexity both on the geometric interpolation itself and in the construction of a conservative tangential flow analogous to the one furnished by the operator @xmath322 defined in identity . hence , despite its mathematical interest , such approach is not viable for large scale simulations as the built - in complexity introduces issues such as ill - conditioned matrices , problems of numerical stability , poor quality of the numerical solutions and high computational costs .",
