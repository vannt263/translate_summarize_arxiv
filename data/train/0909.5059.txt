    "bundles of filamentous polymers like f - actin form primary structural components of a broad range of cytoskeletal structures including stereocilia , filopodia , microvilli , cytoskeletal stress fibers , or the sperm acrosome .",
    "actin - binding proteins allow the cell to tailor the dimensions and mechanical properties of the bundles to suit specific biological functions .",
    "in particular , the mechanical properties of these bundles play key roles in cellular functions ranging from locomotion   @xcite to mechanotransduction  @xcite and fertilization   @xcite . in view of this ubiquity ,",
    "a detailed understanding of bundle mechanics is fundamental to gaining a mechanistic understanding of cellular function  @xcite .",
    "quantifying the governing mechanical principles of these fundamental cytoskeletal constituents could also prove valuable in the design of biomimetic nanomaterials .",
    "in - vitro experiments recently investigated the role of actin - binding proteins like fascin , @xmath0-actinin and @xmath1-plastin in mediating bundle mechanical properties  @xcite .",
    "already an inspection of bundle conformations from fluorescence microscope images makes it evident that the properties of the various crosslinking proteins must be quite distinct . while bundles formed by fascin show a compact form and remain straight over several microns , bundles formed by @xmath0-actinin or filamin are wiggly and very lose   @xcite .",
    "the mechanical properties of actin bundles formed by different crosslinking proteins was quantified by a fluctuation analysis  @xcite , which measures the magnitude of their thermal fluctuations .",
    "it was found that the apparent bundle bending stiffness can be varied over a substantial range by changing the type and relative concentration of the crosslinker .",
    "these intriguing mechanical properties can be understood in terms of the wormlike bundle model ( wlb ) , which describes bundles as an assembly of semiflexible filaments interconnected by crosslinking proteins  @xcite ; for an illustration of the bundle architecture see fig .",
    "[ fig : bundle_illustration ] .",
    "unlike the standard wormlike chain model ( wlc )  @xcite , the wormlike bundle model ( wlb ) exhibits a state - dependent bending stiffness  @xcite that derives from a generic competition between the bending and twist stiffness of individual filaments and their relative motion mediated by the stiffness of the crosslinkers .",
    "an important aspect of the wlb model is that crosslinks may be very efficient in constraining the lateral excursions of filaments within the bundle but much less so in inhibiting their axial motion .",
    "this is possible as the relative axial sliding of two crosslinked filaments probes not only the elastic properties of the crosslinking protein but also those of the binding domain at which the protein is attached to the filament",
    ". the latter may be of quite different rigidity than the protein itself .",
    "unfortunately there are no single - molecule experiments yet which would quantify the mechanical and binding properties of actin crosslinking proteins attached to a pair of f - actin filaments  . in the wlb model the mechanical properties of the crosslinks are described by a single shear - stiffness @xmath2 for the relative sliding of the constituent filaments .",
    "an important finding within the wormlike bundle model is that the mechanical properties of bundles can be classified into three distinct bending regimes that are mediated by both crosslink type and equally importantly by bundle dimensions , namely diameter and length   @xcite .",
    "taking into account the mechanical properties of filaments and crosslinker at a microscopic level is a virtue of the model making it quite verstile .",
    "it reduces to a well defined continuum limit but is equally applicable to bundles with as few as two filaments .",
    "this microscopic perspective may prove a valuable starting point to address more complex questions related to bundle mechanical properties .",
    "this may include problems such as disorder , lattice defects @xcite , or filament fracture  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : quantities_explained ] ) .",
    "this assumption , which neglects crosslink stretching deformations , is based on the recognition that the shearing mode involves deformation of the crosslink _ and _ its binding domain to the filament .",

    "the filaments that lie at a distance @xmath31 away from the central line naturally have a different radius of curvature , @xmath32 , and thus a different bending energy .",
    "the magnitude of the correction term relative to @xmath33 is small since it scales as @xmath34 , i.e. we assume the typical curvatures to be smaller than the bundle radius ( for more details see appendix  [ sec : relat - betw - omeg ] ) .    as to the twist degree of freedom , in eq .",

    "in the previous sections we have restricted our attention to non - helical bundles and assumed that in the ground - state the filaments point along the bundle axis . as a final application of our model",
    ", we will here discuss the question of helicity , or pretwist , and its influence on bundle mechanics .",
    "this aspect is important not only for some types of microtubules but also for f - actin bundles and is reflected in the role that helicity plays in providing an explanation for the existence of a ( thermodynamically ) preferred bundle size  @xcite .",
    "the discussion of pretwisted bundles proceeds in two steps .",
    "we first assume the bundle to form with all filaments straight . starting from this reference state crosslink binding",
    "may add a driving force for twisting the bundle if the straight state does not allow for optimal accessibility of the crosslink binding sites .",
    "another effect may be the helicity of the filaments themselves that favor a twisted bundle over an untwisted one .    without elaborating on the precise mechanism that leads to pretwisted bundles , we incorporate bundle pretwist by substituting the generalized twist - curvature @xmath35 by @xmath228 . in doing",
    "so the new energetic ground - state is at @xmath229 and @xmath230 . to obtain the effective bending rigidity we linearize the curvatures around this ground - state , as performed in eq .",

    "( [ eq : delta_mismatch ] ) , one finds terms like @xmath231 which depend nonlinearly on arclength @xmath14 . thus a transformation to fourier - space is no longer helpful as different modes would remain coupled .",
    "we therefore resort to an alternative approach , and determine the effective bending rigidity by numerical integration of the mechanical equilibrium equations in real space , @xmath232 .",
    "specifically , we determine the end - deflection @xmath233 of a bundle of 4 filaments under a point force @xmath234 at the distal end ( @xmath235 ) , given clamped boundary conditions at the proximal end ( @xmath236 ) . the effective bending rigidity",
    "is then obtained from the expression , @xmath237 , and displayed in fig .",
    "( [ fig : pretwist ] ) as a function of the crosslink shear stiffness , @xmath2 , and a series of values for the pretwist , @xmath238 . for simplicity",

    "thus , in pretwisted , helical bundles the crosslinks only have a limited ability to mechanically couple the different filaments together .",
    "the higher the twist the more the filaments act as if they were independent  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that in pretwisted bundles the filaments exchange their place and those that start on the top of the bundle soon are on the bottom .",

    "we have presented a detailed study of the elastic and dynamic properties of bundles of semiflexible filaments ( wormlike bundle model , wlb ) .",
    "it is found that a competition between the elastic properties of the filaments and those of the crosslinks leads to renormalized effective bend and twist rigidities that can become mode - number dependent .",
    "the strength and character of this dependence varies with bundle architecture , such as the arrangement of filaments in the cross section and pretwist .",
    "two paradigmatic cases of bundle architecture have been discussed ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : quantities_explained ] ) : the first assumes filaments to be arranged homogeneously throughout the cross - section , for example on a square or triangular lattice .",
    "this geometry is particularly relevant for f - actin bundles .",
    "the second architecture has the filaments arranged on the surface of a cylinder as is the case for microtubules . for all bundle architectures ,",
    "the bending rigidity depends on mode - number @xmath163 as @xmath126 .",
    "this is the shear dominated regime , as the bending rigidity is proportional to the shear stiffness , @xmath2 , of the crosslinks  @xcite .",
    "it is in this parameter regime that the bundle behaves qualitatively different than either a homogeneous beam ( obtained in the `` fully coupled '' limit ) or an assembly of `` decoupled '' filaments .",
    "each architecture has its own universal ratio of maximal to minimal bending rigidity , independent of the specific type of crosslink induced filament coupling . for microtubules ( without pretwist )",
    "we find the ratio @xmath243 , which is in reasonable agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "an important factor in determining the strength of crosslink - induced filament coupling is the pretwist ( helicity ) of the bundle .",
    "numerical computation shows that the effective bending rigidity decreases with increasing the pretwist .",
    "this has interesting consequences for microtubules , where the amount of pretwist depends on the number of protofilaments , @xmath6 .",
    "different microtubule types are therefore predicted to have different variations in their effective bending rigidity .",
    "these predictions could be tested in experiments that are able to select the microtubule type and measure their bending rigidity independently .",
    "we have discussed several further observables , static and dynamic , that could be relevant to experiments .",
    "we have shown that the concept of the persistence length becomes ambiguous and depends on the observable used .",
    "the usual definition via the tangent - tangent correlation function is shown to lead to a persistence - length that depends on the scale of observation .",
    "further observables that are effected by the mode - dependent bending rigidity are the force - extension relation or the buckling force  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in the intermediate regime the latter is constant and independent of bundle length .",
    "the dynamic properties of bundles are characterized by a complex cross - over scenario which is in one - to - one correspondence with the three regimes of decoupled , intermediate and fully - coupled bending . while decoupled and fully - coupled bending display the usual @xmath244 in the correlation function , it is shown that the shear - coupling leads to an intermediate asymptotic regime , where the correlations only grow as @xmath245 .",
    "the response functions for longitudinal and transverse forces also reflect these different regimes .",
    "in contrast to the wlc , they are not just proportional to each other but show distinct frequency dependences",
    ". these findings may be relevant for microrheological experiments , with imbedded bead particles directly coupling to the transverse bundle fluctuations .",
    "possibilities for future studies may be to look into the effects of filament fracture or lattice defects .",
    "the elastic energy represents a harmonic approximation which should be extended to include nonlinear effects . especially for microtubules",
    "one may expected nonlinear effects to play an important role in bundle mechanics .",
    "for example , it may be important to consider that protofilaments in their unstressed state are not straight but bend radially outwards .",
    "aditional complications could also arise from the fact that some microtubules are not transversly isotropic as we have assumed here , but have a `` seam '' , where protofilaments are offset relative to their neighbors .",
    "failure modes under axial compressive forces have been discussed in a model for microtubules that starts from a transversly isotropic shell theory  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to compare the results of a generalized wlb model  to include cross - sectional deformations  with their results for the critical buckling forces .",
    "one mode of failure , the ovalization of the microtubule cross - section ( brazier effect ) may for example be taken into account by adjusting the cross - sectional coordinates with the help of an `` ovalization parameter '' .",

    "the new vectors are then given by @xmath312 and the bundle twist , @xmath35 , can be calculated as before @xmath313 the twist energy should thus be written as @xmath314 where we defined the moments of the filament twist distribution @xmath315 .    as explained above , in crosslinked bundles this internal twist",
    "can be assumed to be quenched at the time of bundle formation . in this case",
    "we need not treat the @xmath316 as dynamical variables for the discussion of bundle deformation .",
    "a finite @xmath317 nevertheless gives the bundle a certain helicity and imposes pretwist , as discussed in section  [ sec : pretwisted - bundles ] .",
    "to calculate the geometric part @xmath81 of the shear deformation , an expression for the arclength mismatch between the two points on the filament pair is needed .",
    "the general expression is @xmath318 where the first contribution , @xmath319 , derives from the possibility that the two points do not correspond to the same point , @xmath14 , on the bundle central line .    by using eqs .",
    "( [ rkprime ] ) , ( [ tangent_k ] ) and expanding one finds @xmath320\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , we defined @xmath321 pointing from filament @xmath13 to filament @xmath322 . as in the formulation of @xmath64",
    ", only the leading order terms have been accounted for .",
    "the @xmath323-term only contains bending deformations .",
    "this may be seen by setting @xmath324 appropriate for a pure twisting of the central line .",
    "then @xmath325 as the vector @xmath61 lies within the cross - section , that is perpendicular to the tangent .",
    "the last term corresponds to the arclength - difference acquired between two filaments at different distance to the central - line ( @xmath326 ) .",
    "it is clear that the filament farther out has to go a longer distance , so its crosslinking sites will stay back in comparison to that of its neighbor closer in the center of the bundle .",
    "however , twist also produces shear deformation between filaments which lie at equal distance to the central line ( @xmath327 ) .",
    "this is embodied in the extra term @xmath319 , which we treat now ( also see fig .  [",
    "fig : delta_mt ] ) . to derive an expression for the shear displacement in this case ,",
    "assume that the two filaments lie , separated by a distance @xmath59 , on the surface of a cylinder of radius @xmath31 .",
    "twisting the cylinder makes the filaments wind around it , each taking an angle @xmath328 to the cylinder axis .",
    "the shear deformation then simply is @xmath329 . for arbitrary orientation of the filament pair",
    "we have to write @xmath330 , where @xmath331 is the tangent to the midline between the filament pair . in agreement",
    "to what has been said above , this mechanism does not contribute to the shear displacement when the filament pair @xmath51 is connected by crosslinks in radial direction . in this case ,",
    "@xmath332 , and the shear deformation @xmath333 ."
