    "<S> the microscopic structure of space and time is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> it is proposed that space and time of an inertial observer @xmath0 are most conveniently described as a crystal array @xmath1 , with nodes representing measurement ` tickmarks ' and connected by independent quantized harmonic oscillators which vibrate more severely the faster @xmath0 moves with respect to the object being measured ( due to the uncertainty principle ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lorentz transformation of special relativity is derived . </S>",
    "<S> further , mass is understood as a localized region @xmath2 having higher vibration temperature than that of the ambient lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of relativistic mass increase may then be calculated without appealing to energy - momentum conservation . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of gravitation is shown to be simply a transport of energy from the boundary of @xmath2 outwards by lattice phonon conduction , as the system tends towards equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> application to a single point mass leads readily to the schwarzschild metric , while a new solution is available for two point masses - a situation where general relativity is too complicated to work with . </S>",
    "<S> the important consequence is that inertial observers who move at relative speeds too close to @xmath3 are no longer linked by the lorentz transformation , because the lattice of the ` moving ' observer has already disintegrated into a liquid state .     </S>",
    "<S> + in this work i propose a model for the microscopic structure of space and time to understand relativity and the origin of mass and gravitation in terms of statistical mechanics .    </S>",
    "<S> the underlying ideas originated from an examination of special relativity ( einstein 1905 ) , which does not treat distances and times as absolute . for a uniformly ` moving ' observer , one can disregard spatial dimensions perpendicular to the velocity of motion @xmath4 and elaborate the previous statement as meaning that if @xmath5 measures : ( i ) position differences between events at the same time , or ( ii ) time differences at the same position , the resulting distances and intervals are smaller than those of a ` stationary ' observer @xmath0 who measures the same events from a frame at rest with respect to them , by a common factor @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> since each of the two effects ( i ) and ( ii ) was presented without interference from the other , they can in general be superposed to form the lorentz transformation ( i.e. rotation ) of space - time ( lorentz 1923 ) . </S>",
    "<S> one could also describe the phenomenon as due to a measuring apparatus having different intrinsic properties when set in ` motion ' . </S>",
    "<S> thus another way of expressing ( i ) is to visualize the ` tickmarks ' which calibrate the ruler of @xmath5 as more widely separated than those of @xmath0 , as illustrated in figure 1 . if a unit of length for @xmath0 is @xmath7 then the same for @xmath5 will be @xmath8 , which is of the form @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , suggesting that microscopically space - time might be undergoing a ` random walk ' process of some kind . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , ( ii ) may also be viewed in this way , because the lorentz transformation of time is the same as that of space , except time is being re - scaled by the speed @xmath11 to form a different dimension , see figure 2 . to avoid duplication , </S>",
    "<S> the ensuing treatment will emphasize effect ( i ) only .    </S>",
    "<S> the particular manner of considering special relativity as changes in the measuring devices of a travelling observer matches well with a statistical approach : an obvious way of further separating the ` tickmarks ' of a ` moving ' ruler , is if they are not part of a rigid body , but their relative positions can fluctuate while in motion , maintaining the mean translational velocities @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> i shall pursue the fluctuations specifically as oscillations , the amplitude of which increase with the relative speed @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the spirit of approach is in accordance with the heisenberg uncertainty principle ( heisenberg 1930 ) : the higher the velocity ( or momentum ) being measured the larger the inherent uncertainties ( deviations ) in the ability of an apparatus to determine @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with the product @xmath16 reaching the smallest value @xmath17 only for ground states where motion of the object is minimized . </S>",
    "<S> i therefore let the natural separation of the ` tickmarks ' be @xmath18 ( note that @xmath19 , for reasons to be explained ) . to this i add a sinusoidal variable @xmath20 , which has a mean @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the total separation @xmath22 , then , has a mean @xmath23 , but the r.m.s . </S>",
    "<S> value is given by : @xmath24 and is @xmath25 . for the purpose of distance measurements </S>",
    "<S> it is the magnitude of @xmath15 , not the sign , which calibrates the length between a pair of ` tickmarks ' at any phase of the cycle . if @xmath15 oscillates rapidly as an expectation value , proportional to energy . ] and substantially about @xmath18 , it is then @xmath26 which defines a unit of length . </S>",
    "<S> an analogy is that of our mains ac power supply . </S>",
    "<S> most electric appliances recognize only the magnitude of @xmath27 and have response times slow compared with typical ac cycle frequencies of @xmath28 a few @xmath29 10 hz , so that the relevant output voltage is @xmath30 , even though @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental postulates of the theory are stated here . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point concerns the first two of them .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(a ) space _ and _ time form a crystal lattice , the lattice points ( hereafter simply referred to as ` nodes ' , which represent the ` tickmarks ' of an observer ) are connected by independent harmonic oscillators with quantized energy levels @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> all inertial observers @xmath0 at rest relative to each other are assigned a common rest frame lattice @xmath1 with which measurements are naturally performed .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(b ) the degree of oscillation of @xmath1 is parametrized by a temperature which may be defined not only with respect to @xmath0 , but also _ any _ inertial observer @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath33 , this will become the rest temperature , which is taken to have an ambient value of 0 k. if a relative speed @xmath34 exists between the two frames , this temperature will be @xmath35 0 k , by an amount @xmath36 which increases with @xmath13 in a simple manner to be formulated below ; as a result the quantity @xmath26 is larger for @xmath5 than for @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(c ) matter owes its origin to a localized region @xmath2 of @xmath1 having a rest temperature @xmath35 0 k. the quantity we define as rest _ </S>",
    "<S> mass _ is proportional to this surplus of energy within @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> an oscillator in @xmath2 has larger than ambient amplitude , i.e. @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> with respect to @xmath5 this amplitude is further increased , by the same factor as @xmath26 does in postulate ( b ) , see figure 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the situation may be likened to @xmath0 being already in a local lorentz frame ( which widens @xmath26 to @xmath38 ) , and @xmath5 moving relative to @xmath0 at the stipulated speed @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(d ) the effect of gravitation is due to conduction of energy by the oscillator waves ( phonons ) from the hotter region of @xmath2 to the cooler ambient region . </S>",
    "<S> the process causes a gradual downward trend in the temperature as one moves away from @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> there is consequently a distribution of oscillator lengths , thereby affecting the separation of the measurement ` tickmarks ' , see figure 3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the reason for the curvature of space - time responsible for the existence of universal gravitation in the lattice surrounding @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> none of the above is in conflict with the first relativity postulate , viz . that no preferred frame of rest exists </S>",
    "<S> . there is also no violation of the second postulate .    </S>",
    "<S> i now focus on special relativity , viz </S>",
    "<S> . postulates ( a ) and ( b ) . when applying to inertial observers in relative motion , note that even for @xmath0 the ambient separation between nodes of @xmath1 is larger than @xmath18 , due to the zero point energy which leads to a finite @xmath39 given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the oscillator ( spring ) constant . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute minimum unit of length is then obtained from equ ( 1 ) as @xmath42 since energy is additive , for finite @xmath13 ( ambient @xmath43 ) @xmath7 increases to : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the mean energy at temperature @xmath36 , calculated with the lowest level now having energy @xmath46 ( i.e. @xmath47 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant partition function is @xmath48 $ ] , leading to a mean energy of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> substituting these into equ ( 3 ) , one obtains : @xmath50 at this point i complete postulate ( b ) above with the following quantitative relationship between @xmath13 and @xmath36 : @xmath51 combining ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , one gets : @xmath52 finally , postulate ( a ) is made more specific by invoking : @xmath53 which simply states that the zero point fluctuations double the mean - square separation of nodes from the natural value of @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> equs ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) altogether tell us that the unit length for observer @xmath5 is not @xmath7 , but @xmath55 , implying smaller measured distances for @xmath5 than those for @xmath0 , in accordance with lorentz contraction .    </S>",
    "<S> there remains the possibility that the suceess achieved so far is an illusion , viz . </S>",
    "<S> statistical mechanics of harmonic oscillators is a wrong and completely irrelevant approach to questions concerning the nature of space and time . </S>",
    "<S> although it so happens that special relativity can be explained in this way , the procedure could be merely formal : a wide variety of mathematical formulae describe the many diverse phenomena of the known physical world , the fact that some of the formulae resemble each other in appearance does not immediately imply a parallel in the physics involved . in this instance , however , such concerns are settled by the theory s ability to go beyond special relativity , to shed light on the issues of mass and gravitation .    </S>",
    "<S> i first discuss the relativity of mass . according to postulate ( c ) , mass is an energized lattice region @xmath2 wherein an oscillator has large r.m.s . </S>",
    "<S> amplitude , as illustrated in figure 2 . upon transformation from @xmath0 to @xmath5 ( so that @xmath1 is no longer the rest lattice ) @xmath56 , like @xmath7 , is required by ( c ) and ( b ) to increase by a factor @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the oscillator energy is increased by @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the number of oscillators is , of course , decreased by @xmath57 , see figure 2 . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the total energy within @xmath2 is higher with respect to @xmath5 by @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> this then affords an exceedingly simple derivation of the relativistic increase of the energy within @xmath2 . by ( c ) </S>",
    "<S> the same effect applies to mass .    </S>",
    "<S> next , i demonstrate how equally straightforward it is to explain gravitation as an energy transport effect . </S>",
    "<S> let us center @xmath2 at the origin of the rest lattice @xmath1 , and consider the 1-d conduction of energy in the + x - direction from some position @xmath59 , figure 3 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the notion of an inner boundary from which conduction commences is an abstract one : the boundary does not have to represent the physical size of the mass depicted in figure . </S>",
    "<S> the transport equation is : @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the thermal conductivity of phonons : @xmath62 is the linear phonon density , @xmath63 is the ` speed of sound ' in the lattice , which is a lattice of space _ and _ time . </S>",
    "<S> thus , like the oscillations , there is the need to introduce a new ` time ' axis when defining the propagation speed of these phonons - signature of a fifth dimension . </S>",
    "<S> ] , @xmath64 is the mean energy of a phonon , and @xmath65 is the phonon mean free path , which is the size of the available lattice ( since phonons do not interact ) , i.e. @xmath66 . thus equ ( 8) , together with the meaning of the various symbols involved , imply that @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a constant of integration . combining equs ( 5 ) and ( 9 ) , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains @xmath69 as equation giving the speed of the local lorentz ( or ` free fall ' ) frame at @xmath15 .    since the x - axis can represent a radial direction , we now write @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in the limit of @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) </S>",
    "<S> there should be agreement with newtonian gravity . </S>",
    "<S> this requires @xmath74 , which removes the arbitrariness of the solution . returning to equ ( 9 ) </S>",
    "<S> , one clearly sees that @xmath75 , consistent with the proposition in postulate ( c ) that mass is proportional to incumbent energy . at high speeds the role of @xmath76 </S>",
    "<S> must be taken into account ( @xmath77 as @xmath78 ) . in the case of spherical symmetry </S>",
    "<S> there is only one free parameter in the problem , i.e. @xmath76 must depend on @xmath68 . by setting @xmath79 , equ ( 10 ) </S>",
    "<S> reduces to @xmath80 , or @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore apparent that the ` tickmarks ' of @xmath82 ( or @xmath15 ) are non - uniformly distributed throughout @xmath1 , due to the energy outflow , in such a way that if they are used to measure @xmath82 ( or @xmath15 ) the result is radius in euclidean ( flat ) space - time . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the expression for @xmath57 contains all the information one needs to construct the full schwarzschild metric ( schwarzschild 1916 ) of general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> for example , as a falling object approaches the gravitational radius ( or event horizon ) @xmath83 time dilation becomes infinite . </S>",
    "<S> the notion of a ` boundary ' for @xmath2 is now clear : phonon energy transport to other parts of the lattice takes place only beyond the event horizon .    </S>",
    "<S> apart from its ability to offer insightful , even elegant , explanations of fundamental laws of physics , the model presented here can also make predictions . </S>",
    "<S> one immediate application is the problem of two point masses , where no known solution of the einstein field equations exist . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon conduction approach reduces the mathematical complexities by manifold . </S>",
    "<S> a member of the pair may be taken as the mass @xmath84 described above ( except now @xmath85 ) while the other ( mass @xmath86 ) is positioned at euclidean distance @xmath87 from the first . </S>",
    "<S> the separation between their event horizons is then @xmath88 , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> since the presence of mass @xmath86 can not alter the boundary conditions for the outward energy transport from mass @xmath91 and vice versa , one simply solves for the oscillator ( phonon ) energy @xmath92 due to mass @xmath91 , likewise @xmath93 due to @xmath86 , for any position along the line joining the two masses and distance @xmath82 from the first . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy at this position is @xmath94 $ ] . by using equ ( 5 ) , we have the speed @xmath13 of the local lorentz frame at @xmath82 : @xmath95 this gives for the first time the space - time metric at any position between two masses . for more complicated mass distributions , </S>",
    "<S> the metric at any point is given by the superposition of all the outwardly conducted energy distributions , in the same manner as above .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , i found that a simple microscopic model of space - time can explain the lorentz transformation and the origin of mass and gravitation very naturally . in this model , space and time </S>",
    "<S> form a crystal lattice , with nodes connected by harmonic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> the notion of distances and times has no meaning unless measurements are performed using the nodes as ` tickmarks ' to define unit intervals . </S>",
    "<S> the faster the speed of an object , the ` fuzzier ' the measurement , and this is reflected in equ ( 5 ) wherein the nodes vibrate with a temperature @xmath36 which increases with the relative speed @xmath13 between a rest lattice and a ` moving ' object . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath96 , @xmath36 reaches infinity , implying that the lattice has already disintegrated before that . thus there must exist a threshold @xmath13 ( @xmath97 ) which corresponds to a critical @xmath36 , observers who move with respect to each other at speeds high than this value are no longer connected by the lorentz transformation . in other words , while relativity links the macroscopic properties of crystal lattices at different vibration temperatures , here we are comparing two fundamentally different lattices , viz . </S>",
    "<S> those of a crystal and a liquid .    </S>",
    "<S> i am indebted to dr massimilano bonamente for suggesting a harmonic oscillator model for the space - time lattice of a moving observer . </S>"
