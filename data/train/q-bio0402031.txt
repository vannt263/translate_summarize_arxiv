    "methodological considerations about the use of maps in computational neuroscience can be found in these references .    a three - variable map with one slow and two fast variables has been recently introduced by kuva et al .  @xcite .",
    "it is able to reproduce complex biological behaviors , such as bursting , cardiac - like spikes , chaotic orbits and slow regular spikes ( `` singlet bursting '' ) .",

    "the following three - dimensional non - linear map has been proposed as a minimal excitable bursting cell model  @xcite : @xmath0 like in the hindmarsh - rose model  @xcite , the variable @xmath1 represents the instantaneous membrane potential , @xmath2 is a recovery variable and @xmath3 can be considered a slow adaptive current if @xmath4 and @xmath5 are set to small values ( @xmath6 ) . under these conditions",
    ", we can identify @xmath7 with e.g. the ca@xmath8-dependent k@xmath9 current @xmath10  @xcite , since its time scale and general effect ( long lasting hyperpolarizaton and adaptation of firing rates ) are very similar .",

    "the analysis of the two - variable system shows  @xcite that , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 fixed , a sub - critical hopf bifurcation occurs if we increase the term @xmath30 ( that is , the bias parameter @xmath31 and the external current @xmath32 ) . with @xmath33 ,",

    "close to the bifurcation line , the behavior is that of an excitable cell  @xcite .",
    "since the hopf bifurcation is sub - critical ( `` hard excitation '' ) , this model belongs to the class of the fitzhugh - nagumo and hodgkin - huxley models ( class i neurons )  @xcite , where the stable fixed point is a focus ( perturbations lead to spiraling behavior in the phase plane ) .",
    "these small oscillations are described in biophysical models , after linearization about the fixed point , as a phenomenological inductance behavior ( see chapter 10 in  @xcite ) .",
    "the three - variable model presents several qualitatively different dynamical behaviors which are usual in real biological neurons ( fig .",

    "as opposed to the @xmath41 case , the bifurcation line in the @xmath45 vs. @xmath28 plane now presents a minimum , signaling that for sufficiently low values of @xmath45 , the fixed point can become stable by lowering @xmath28 ( fig .",
