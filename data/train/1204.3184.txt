    "the mathematical analysis and numerical analysis of partial differential equations in high - contrast and multiscale media are important for many practical applications . for instance , in porous media applications , the permeability of subsurface regions is described as a quantity with high - contrast and multiscale features . a main goal is to understand the effects and complexity related to this multiscale variation and high - contrast in the coefficients .",

    "numerical methods based on different asymptotic analysis are detailed in  @xcite .    in the case of elliptic problems with oscillating coefficients and bounded contrast , multiscale methods and homogenizations techniques have been successfully applied to study solutions of elliptic differential equations ( c.f .",
    ",  @xcite and references therein ) . many homogenization and multiscale methods start with the derivation of an asymptotic expansion for the solution of the partial differential equation",
    ". the expansion is written in terms of the problem parameter(s ) : e.g. , the period in the case of oscillating periodic coefficients .",
    "the asymptotic expansion is then used to study the problem at hand .    in this paper and in the same spirit",
    ", we derive asymptotic expansions for the solutions of elliptic problems with high - contrast . in this case",
    "the parameter to be consider is the contrast in the coefficient .",

    "we mention  @xcite where a discrete network approximation is considered for the problem of computing the effective conductivity of high - contrast , randomly , and densely packed composites with high - conductivity inclusions .",
    "the network approximation depends on the geometry of the inclusions and the behavior of the solution between nearby inclusions . the authors can localize the interaction of high - conductivity inclusions using graph - theoretical concepts .",
    "furthermore , they propose a finite element approach for solving the resulting system and identifying the first order approximation of the solution . in  @xcite",

    "this problem is important in flow applications where low conductivity regions represent shale regions and can substantially alter the overall flow behavior . to our best knowledge ,",
    "this problem is not extensively studied in the literature .",

    "we show how to obtain all the coefficients in the expansions .",
    "the procedure to compute the coefficients , coincide with a dirichlet - to - neumann procedure as in domain decompositions methods ; see  @xcite .",
