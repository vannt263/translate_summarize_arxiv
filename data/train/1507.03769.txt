    "the study of vector mesons ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath0 ) in nuclear matter has attracted much interest during the last two decades @xcite . in recent years , the @xmath0 meson has particularly come into focus , with dedicated experiments investigating its in - medium properties conducted for instance at kek @xcite and at cosy - anke @xcite .",
    "more detailed measurements are being planned for the future in the e16 experiment at j - parc @xcite .",
    "interpreting the experimental findings requires a thorough theoretical understanding of the modification of the @xmath0 meson spectral function at finite density .",
    "one important issue that needs to be understood is whether and how the modifications of the @xmath0 meson spectral density in nuclear matter reflect changes of the non - perturbative qcd vacuum at finite densities .",
    "this question has been investigated previously in the context of qcd sum rules at finite density @xcite . using updated input we argue in the present work that the two lowest ( zeroth and first ) moments are especially suitable for a detailed study of the spectral function with respect to low - dimensional qcd condensates .",
    "these lowest moments involve only operators up to dimension 4 which are relatively well understood .",
    "condensates of dimension 6 and higher ( such as the four - quark condensates ) do not yet enter at that stage .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the first over the zeroth moment provides a well defined quantity representing a squared mass averaged over the @xmath0 resonance plus low - energy continuum .",
    "this ratio does not depend on details of the spectral function and can in principle be accessed by experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "this article presents a systematic analysis of the lowest two moments of the @xmath0 meson spectral function , using finite - energy qcd sum rules ( fesr ) . to describe the spectral function in vacuum we employ a generalized and improved vector dominance model @xcite and constrain its parameters by recent @xmath2 cross section data @xcite .",
    "the changes of this spectrum in nuclear matter are expressed using updated kaon - nucleon forward scattering amplitudes , with interactions derived from chiral @xmath1 effective field theory and coupled channels @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectral functions are then tested for their consistency with fesr .",
    "also included is a short digression on higher moments and the strange four - quark condensate .",
    "a summary and conclusions follow in the final section .",

    "the vacuum case is realized in the limit @xmath9 . for a @xmath0 meson at rest",
    "it suffices to study the ( dimensionless ) contracted correlator , @xmath10 . using an improved vector dominance model @xcite , @xmath11 can be written as @xmath12 the self - energy @xmath13 ( of dimension @xmath14 ) is governed by the coupling of the @xmath0 to @xmath15 loops and their propagation @xcite , either in vacuum or in the nuclear medium .",
    "the bare mass @xmath16 and the coupling constant @xmath17 are determined to agree with experimental observations .",
    "the coupling strength is expected to be of the order of the value determined by @xmath1 symmetry , @xmath18 , with @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , the constant @xmath20 represents the ratio between the @xmath21 and @xmath22 couplings and should be close to unity @xcite .",
    "here we assume @xmath23 which gives a very good fit to the experimental @xmath2 data as will be shown below .",
    "the @xmath0 self - energy includes the contributions from charged and neutral kaon loops : @xmath24 for specific expressions of the corresponding loop integrals , see @xcite .",
    "the actual values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 are determined by fitting eq.([eq : veccorr3 ] ) to the recent precise measurement of the @xmath2 cross section provided by the babar collaboration @xcite . as in this reaction",
    "only the charged kaons are detected , only the corresponding @xmath25 term of @xmath26 appearing in the numerator of eq.([eq : veccorr3 ] ) should be kept while intermediate charge exchange processes , @xmath27 , are included in the resummation of the @xmath15 loops . in order to describe the data at energies in the continuum above the @xmath0 meson peak where the simple model of eq.([eq : veccorr3 ] ) can not be expected to work ,",
    "we add a second order polynomial in @xmath28 , for @xmath29 : @xmath30 with coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 fitted to the data .",
    "this form of the @xmath33 continuum will be kept both in vacuum and nuclear matter .",
    "the result of this fit gives @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the respective curve is shown in fig.[fig : vac.fit ] together with the experimental data .     in vacuum ,",
    "compared to the experimental data for @xmath38 , adapted from @xcite .",
    "the dashed [ solid ] curve shows the result when only eq.([eq : veccorr3 ] ) [ both eqs.([eq : veccorr3 ] ) and ( [ eq : continuum ] ) ] are used for the fit .",
    "the dotted horizontal line stands for the perturbative qcd limit while the thin gray line represents the full spectral function of eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) , including @xmath39 and @xmath40 channels.,width=302 ]    as demonstrated in this figure , the parametrizations ( [ eq : veccorr3],[eq : continuum ] ) give an accurate description of the data up to about @xmath41 , above which the experimental points are seen to drop rapidly .",
    "this drop is parametrized by a simple linear curve fitted to the data points in this region .",
    "additional channels beyond @xmath2 , such as @xmath39 and @xmath40 final states , are less well established by empirical data .",
    "we include them schematically in the thin solid line shown in fig.[fig : vac.fit ] .      in the deep - euclidean limit ( @xmath42 ) the correlator ( [ eq : veccorr1 ] )",
    "can be expressed with the help of the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",

    "we keep only the most important contributions , sufficient for the purposes of the present work .    using the once subtracted dispersion relation @xmath49 and applying the borel transformation ,",
    "one derives the sum rule : @xmath50 with the spectral function @xmath51 at large @xmath52 this spectral function approaches its perturbative qcd limit , so the following ansatz is introduced : @xmath53 with @xmath54 , and @xmath55 represents a scale that delineates the low - energy and high - energy parts of the spectrum .",
    "substituting this into eq.([eq : sumrule ] ) and expanding the left - hand side in inverse powers of @xmath56 , one derives the finite - energy sum rules : @xmath57 in the following we focus on the first two moments ( [ eq : sm1],[eq : sm2 ] ) for which the respective wilson coefficients are determined with sufficient accuracy .          in the next step the moments of the spectral function ( [ eq : veccorr3 ] )",
    "are analyzed using the sum rules ( [ eq : sm1],[eq : sm2 ] ) and following refs.@xcite .",
    "to do this we substitute eq.([eq : veccorr3 ] ) into the left - hand sides of eqs.([eq : sm1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sm2 ] ) and solve them individually for @xmath55 .    in fig.[fig :",
    "vac.moments ] we compare the left- and right - hand sides of eqs.([eq : sm1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sm2 ] ) .",
    "the parameters entering the right - hand sides are listed in table [ tab : parameters ] .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     for the strangeness sigma term , @xmath58 , no generally accepted value is available at present and we hence take a rather broad range that encompasses almost all recent studies @xcite , including direct lattice qcd computations and chiral extrapolations of available lattice data .    with these inputs ,",
    "the analysis of in - medium spectral moments is now carried out in the same way as in the previous section .",
    "as a first step , consider only s - wave kaon- and antikaon - nucleon interactions , using the dashed curve in fig.[fig : vac ] as input for the analysis .",
    "we solve again eqs.([eq : sm1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sm2 ] ) for the in - medium delineation scale between low - energy and perturbative qcd regions , now denoted @xmath59 in order to distinguish it from the vacuum value @xmath55 .",
    "the left- and right - hand sides of the equations are shown in fig.[fig : matter.moments ] as functions of @xmath60 .",
    "at normal nuclear matter density , @xmath61 @xmath62 , one finds @xmath63 from the zeroth moment , and @xmath64 from the first moment . at this point",
    "both in - medium scales are again consistent with each other and show no change in comparison with the corresponding vacuum values .",
    "setting once again @xmath65 as in the vacuum case , the ratio of first to zeroth moment is then evaluated as @xmath66 comparing this result with eq.([eq : ratio.vacuum ] ) it is seen that the averaged mass @xmath67 at @xmath68 does not deviate from the vacuum value apart from a marginal downward shift .",
    "in contrast , the resonant @xmath0 meson peak experiences a significant broadening , with a width of @xmath69 at normal nuclear matter density . the width is determined by the imaginary part of the self - energy at the resonance maximum .",
    "effects of p - wave antikaon - nucleon interactions are studied employing the dash - dotted curve of fig.[fig : vac ] .",
    "the numerical analysis is performed as in the previous paragraphs and with the same ope input . for the scale parameter @xmath59 at @xmath68",
    ", we extract @xmath70 from the zeroth moment , and @xmath71 from the first moment .",
    "the behavior of the left- and right - hand sides of eqs.([eq : sm1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sm2 ] ) is similar to the s - wave case and we do not show it here . finally , setting @xmath65 as before , the ratio of first to zeroth moments at @xmath68 including both s- and p - wave interactions is computed as : @xmath72 comparing this result with the vacuum value @xmath73 of eq.([eq : ratio.vacuum ] ) , the averaged mass now experiences a modest downward shift by about @xmath74 , more than for the pure s - wave case .",
    "this difference is explained by both a small shift of the @xmath0 resonance peak and the pronounced low - energy continuum in the spectral function , caused by the opening of kaon - hyperon channels in the presence of p - wave interactions ( see fig.[fig : vac ] ) .",
    "the broadening of the in - medium @xmath0 resonance is further increased significantly , reaching @xmath75 , an order of magnitude larger than the vacuum width ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "so far our fesr analysis has been restricted to the lowest two moments of @xmath77 , eqs.([eq : sm1],[eq : sm2 ] ) .",
    "let us now briefly turn to the next - higher moment and the respective sum rule , eq.([eq : sm3 ] ) , and study its implications for the vacuum and in - medium four - quark condensates .",
    "first , we introduce the commonly used parametrization based on the factorization hypothesis : @xmath78 exact vacuum saturation corresponds to @xmath79 .",
    "any deviation from this value signals the degree of violation of the factorization assumption .    at finite density , the right - hand side of eq.([eq : fourquark1 ] )",
    "is changed to @xmath80 where @xmath81 can now in general depend on the density @xmath3 and the in - medium strange quark condensate has been expanded to leading order in @xmath3 .",
    "let us furthermore note that as long as @xmath82 or @xmath83 take values of order 1 and larger , the four - quark condensate term in eq.([eq : operesult3 ] ) dominates over the other two terms of higher order in @xmath48 .",
    "these terms can thus be safely neglected for the purposes of this discussion .",
    "further terms that could show up at dimension 6 include the mixed condensate ( @xmath84 ) and the gluon condensate involving three gluon fields ( @xmath85 ) . for the vector correlator , the wilson coefficients of both these condensates are known to vanish at leading order in @xmath47 and are therefore suppressed .",
    "next , we combine our spectral function and the threshold parameters obtained from the zeroth and first moments with the fesr of eq.([eq : sm3 ] ) in order to examine possible constraints for @xmath82 and @xmath83 . for the vacuum case",
    "the result of this investigation is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : four.quark ] .     of the four - quark condensate defined in eq.([eq : fourquark1 ] ) , extracted from the second moment sum rule ( [ eq : sm3 ] ) , as a function of the scale @xmath86 delineating low - energy and pqcd regions .",
    "the vertical dashed lines show the bounds of @xmath87 , as obtained from the zeroth moment sum rule .",
    "the horizontal short - dashed line indicates @xmath88 , corresponding to the exact factorization hypothesis .",
    ", width=302 ]    the large uncertainties in @xmath82 can be understood from the fact that , compared to the leading order perturbative qcd term proportional to @xmath89 , the @xmath45 in eq.([eq : sm3 ] ) gives only a small correction to the sum rule .",
    "the strange four - quark condensate is therefore not so well constrained . a strong dependence of @xmath82 on the scale parameter @xmath86 is observed .",
    "for a typical value , @xmath90 gev , one finds @xmath91 despite such large uncertainties , it can be concluded at least qualitatively that factorization @xmath92 is not expected to be a good approximation . repeating this analysis for the in - medium case with s- and",
    "p - wave kaon- and antikaon - nuclear interactions shows a similar tendency for @xmath81 , indicating that the factorization hypothesis appears to be strongly violated in nuclear matter . at finite density , a full analysis including additional",
    ", potentially large twist-2 and twist-4 terms will however be needed to reach a definitive conclusion ( see @xcite for a discussion of some of these terms ) .",
    "this issues deserve a more detailed investigation that we plan to pursue in a forthcoming publication .",
    "this work has been focused on the @xmath0 meson spectral functions in vacuum and in nuclear matter using new and updated input for the computation of @xmath93 loops and their interactions with nucleons in the surrounding medium .",
    "a test of these spectral functions has been performed in comparison with qcd finite - energy sum rules ( fesr ) .",
    "the detailed investigation of fesrs for the zeroth and and first moments of these spectral functions demonstrates consistency with well established qcd operators and condensates involving strange quarks and gluons up to dimension four .",
    "this non - trivial conclusion holds both in the vacuum and for in - medium quantities at leading order in the density .",
    "less well determined operators of higher dimension , such as four - quark condensates , appear in conjunction with the second spectral moment and have also been briefly examined and discussed . while the fesr results for this next - higher moment are subject to relatively large uncertainties , a qualitative conclusion can already be drawn , namely that the frequently used factorization ( i.e. ground state saturation ) hypothesis is not likely to work , either in the vacuum or in the nuclear medium .    the @xmath0 spectral function in vacuum",
    "is constructed combining an improved vector dominance approach with a background parametrization that fits the recent high - quality @xmath94 data provided by the babar collaboration .",
    "the resulting zeroth and first spectral moments are in perfect agreement with the fesr analysis . in the nuclear medium",
    "the @xmath0 resonance experiences strong broadening , mainly from the in - medium interactions that couple the @xmath95 loop to @xmath96-hyperon continuum channels . induced by such mechanisms the @xmath0 width increases to about @xmath97 at normal nuclear matter density @xmath98 , a factor of ten larger than the vacuum decay width .",
    "the in - medium ( downward ) mass shift of the @xmath0 turns out to be small . at @xmath68",
    "it amounts to less than 2% of its vacuum mass .",
    "this confirms findings of earlier studies based on chiral su(3 ) models @xcite .    in this work , we have restricted ourselves to the case of a @xmath0 meson at rest with respect to the nuclear medium .",
    "some caution is therefore needed when comparing our results to experiments , in which the measured spectrum always involves finite momentum contributions @xcite .",
    "effects of non - zero momenta have so far only been investigated in the sum rule approach of @xcite .",
    "more detailed systematic studies are required to fully understand the finite - momentum effects , especially in view of the e-16 experiment at j - parc , where @xmath0 meson spectra at a sequence of different momenta are planned to be measured @xcite .",
    "further quantitative improvements of the present analysis will include , for instance , implementing a more realistic treatment of the onset of the continuum . in the present work the delineation between the low - energy hadronic region and",
    "the qcd continuum has been introduced by a simple step - function at a scale @xmath99 which turned out to emerge consistently at @xmath100 gev .",
    "a softer transition represented by a ramp function @xcite should make sure that conclusions do not depend on details of this ramping into the continuum . an extended publication , including a full discussion of such refinements , is in preparation .",
    "finally let us point out implications of the present study for future measurements of the in - medium @xmath0 meson spectral function , in particular with reference to the e16 experiment planned to be performed at j - parc .",
    "a characteristic feature of the in - medium spectra shown in fig . [ fig : vac ] is their non - symmetric behavior around the @xmath0 meson peak , with an enhancement of strength in the low - energy sub - resonance region caused by strong broadening and the opening of new decay channels .",
    "such behavior should be taken into account when analyzing the experimental spectra .",
    "in addition we once more emphasize the usefulness of the two lowest spectral moments as they provide a direct link to the most relevant low - dimensional qcd condensates and their respective changes in nuclear matter .",
    "precise measurements of these moments with nuclear targets would make it possible to constrain the behavior of the gluon and strange quark condensates at finite baryon density .",
