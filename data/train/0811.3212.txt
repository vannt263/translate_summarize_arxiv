    "@xmath0 is a material of great interest as it shows heavy fermion behavior at low temperatures ( @xmath1 10 k ) in spite of being a _",
    "d_-electron metal.@xcite this is of particular interest because most of the well known heavy fermion compounds have crystallographically ordered arrays of _ f_-electron atoms .",
    "@xmath0 has a face - centred cubic crystal structure ( space group @xmath2 ) . each v atom",
    "is coordinated with six o atoms to form a slightly distorted octahedron.@xcite the v atoms themselves form corner sharing tetrahedra , often called the `` pyrochlore lattice '' , which is strongly geometrically frustrated for antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "the vanadium atoms with nominal oxidation state of @xmath3 and occupying equivalent sites in the structure make @xmath0 metallic .",
    "the heavy fermion nature of @xmath0 was discovered to occur below @xmath4 10 k from measurements of a large @xmath5-independent magnetic susceptibility @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8/mol and a large sommerfeld coefficient @xmath9 mj / mol k@xmath10.@xcite    magnetic defects in the structure have a pronounced effect on the magnetic properties of @xmath0 . for both polycrystalline samples and single crystals with extremely low magnetic defect concentration ( @xmath11 @xmath12 0.01  mol% ) ,",
    "the low-@xmath5 @xmath6 is @xmath5-independent.@xcite the heavy fermion behavior of @xmath0 referred to above was inferred from measurements on such samples with extremely low @xmath11 .",
    "however , in both powder and single crystal samples of @xmath0 with high @xmath11 ( up to a maximum of 0.8 mol% ) , the magnetic susceptibility shows a curie - like upturn at low @xmath5.@xcite crystal defects are the only possible source of these magnetic defects since magnetic impurity phases as the source of the low @xmath5 curie - like upturn was ruled out.@xcite low @xmath5 magnetization measurements on @xmath0 polycrystalline and single crystal samples containing magnetic defects revealed large values of the average spins of these defects.@xcite the spin values @xmath13 range from @xmath4  2 to 4 .",
    "the presence of magnetic defects has a dramatic influence on @xmath14li nmr measurements of @xmath0 .",
    "nmr measurements on polycrystalline samples of @xmath0 with extremely low @xmath11 show a linear variation of the @xmath14li spin - lattice nuclear relaxation rate ( @xmath15 ) versus @xmath5 at low @xmath5.@xcite this is typical for fermi liquids .",
    "however , for polycrystal samples of @xmath0 with higher amounts of magnetic defects , the @xmath14li @xmath15 shows a peak at @xmath4 1 k , and the relaxation recovery becomes strongly nonexponential.@xcite this observation raises the question whether the ground state of a @xmath0 sample with high @xmath11 is still a fermi liquid or is a non - fermi liquid .",
    "if the ground state changes to a non - fermi liquid , then there might be a critical @xmath11 for the transition .",
    "johnston et al.@xcite suggested a model in which a crystal defect locally lifts the geometric frustration and thus allows magnetic order over a finite region around that defect , called a magnetic droplet .",
    "this model is qualitatively consistent with the large average values of @xmath13 obtained from the low @xmath5 magnetization measurements .",
    "+ given the pronounced effects of the magnetic defects on the properties of @xmath0 , it is very important to examine if there are any periodic correlations in the distribution of the crystal defects which produce the magnetic defects or if they are randomly distributed .",
    "if we assume that a single crystal defect gives rise to a single magnetic defect , then the concentrations of crystal defects are extremely small ( @xmath16  0.8 mol% ) to produce any observable change in intensities of x - ray bragg reflections .",
    "one way to look for such small effects is to map out complete reciprocal planes and search for features in addition to the normal bragg reflections .",
    "any long - range periodicity of the crystal defects would produce additional peaks in the x - ray diffraction patterns , and short - range ordering would cause streaking of the bragg peaks . here",
    "we report on the high - energy x - ray studies of single crystals of @xmath0 with different magnetic defect concentrations .",
    "high quality single crystals of @xmath0 used in the experiment were grown in a vertical tube furnace using @xmath17 as the flux.@xcite three crystals , denoted as crystal 2 , crystal 9 , and crystal 10 with respective masses of 0.354 mg , 6.548 mg , and 2.1 mg were examined .",
    "the magnetic measurements on the crystals were done using a quantum design superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer in the temperature range 1.8  ",
    "350 k and magnetic field range 0    5.5 t. the high - energy x - ray difraction measurements were performed at the 6-id - d station in the mu - cat sector of the advanced photon source , argonne national laboratory .",
    "the energy of the radiation was set to 100 kev to ensure full penetration of the sample .",
    "the beam size was @xmath18 mm@xmath10 . to record the full two - dimensional patterns ,",
    "a mar345 image - plate was positioned 705 mm behind the sample . during the experiments ,",
    "the crystals were set between two pieces of thin kapton film and mounted on the sample holder .",
    "figure  [ susc ] shows the magnetic susceptibility @xmath6 versus temperature @xmath5 of the crystals 2 , 9 , and 10 measured in a 1 t magnetic field .",

[ ] ) , @xmath26 is the bohr magneton , @xmath27 is the average spin of the defects , @xmath28 is the brillouin function , @xmath6 is the intrinsic susceptibility of the pure @xmath0 spinel phase in the absence of magnetic defects , and @xmath29 is the applied magnetic field .",

    "in order to search for long - range or short - range order in the arrangement of the crystal defects giving rise to the magnetic defects within the crystal structure , we carried out high - energy synchrotron x - ray diffraction measurements over a wide range of reciprocal space .",
    "the rocking technique used to record the diffraction intensities from planes in reciprocal space has been described in detail in ref . [ ] .",
    "the patterns were obtained by recording the bragg reflections of all points of a reciprocal lattice plane intersecting the ewald sphere .",
    "the orientation of the reciprocal lattice relative to the ewald sphere is given by the orientation of the crystal .",
    "so , tilting the crystal turns complete reciprocal lattice planes of the crystal to intersect the ewald sphere , depending on the range of tilting angle . in the experiment ,",
    "diffraction patterns were obtained by tilting the crystal through two independent angles @xmath39 and @xmath40 perpendicular to the incoming x - ray beam .",
    "patterns were recorded by continously scanning through @xmath39 as @xmath40 was increased in small steps . by averaging the recorded patterns obtained at different values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 ,",
    "a considerable range of the designated reciprocal lattice planes was mapped out .",
    "this averaging over large parts of a brillouin zone also enhances very weak broad scattering features making them detectable .    depending on the kind of modification / deviation of the crystal structure arising from the crystal defects , we expect to see different modifications / deviations in the diffraction patterns of the reciprocal planes",
    ". a crystallographic superstructure , either commensurate or incommensurate , will produce weak additional bragg reflections .",
    "lower - dimensional or short - range order will produce broad features or diffuse scattering .",
    "for example , a two - dimensional order yields a rod - like scattering feature .",
    "if the incoming beam is parallel to the axis of the rod , we will see a spot in the diffraction pattern of that plane . the same feature , however , will yield a streak of intensity in the diffraction patterns of reciprocal planes perpendicular to the rod .    in our experiment ,",
    "reflections from reciprocal lattice planes perpendicular to the three high symmetry directions , namely ( 001 ) , ( @xmath4101 ) , and ( @xmath4111 ) of the cubic structure , were recorded .",
    "figures  [ both](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) show the room temperature diffraction patterns from planes in the reciprocal space of crystal 2 ( @xmath42 = 0.24 mol% ) perpendicular to ( 001 ) , ( @xmath4101 ) , and ( @xmath4111 ) directions , respectively .",
    "the lattice planes perpendicular to the ( @xmath4111 ) direction are very closely spaced .",
    "thus in this direction , when we tilt the crystal , higher order reciprocal planes will also intersect the ewald sphere and be observed.@xcite this was minimized by limiting the range of tilting . in fig .",
    "[ both](c ) , only those spots enclosed by the white lines are due to bragg - reflections from the brillouin zone containing the origin .",
    "the spots outside the polygon arise from other brillouin zones .    in figs .",
    "[ both](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , all the spots observed are allowed by the space group of the crystal .",
    "the intensity at the center of the bragg reflections are 3  6 orders of magnitude higher than counts shown in black at the maximum in the scale for the contour map .",
    "we used iron slabs up to 3 cm in thickness to increase the dynamic range from @xmath43 ( intrinsic for the detector ) to @xmath44 by attenuating the incident x - ray beam .",
    "no extra spots or diffuse scattering were observed in the patterns .",
    "the shape of the spots is also as expected for the given resolution conditions .",
    "thus we conclude that crystal 2 is almost a perfect crystal .",
    "there are no other single crystals or grains oriented in other directions .",
    "the small areas , a little darker than the background and surrounding the sharp black bragg reflection spots , are the tails of the bragg reflections .",
    "figures  [ both](d ) , ( e ) , and ( f ) show the room temperature x - ray diffraction patterns from reciprocal planes of crystal 9 ( @xmath42 = 0.62 mol% ) perpendicular to ( 001 ) , ( @xmath4101 ) , and ( @xmath4111 ) directions , respectively . for the planes perpendicular to the ( 001 ) and ( @xmath4101 ) directions , there are no differences between the patterns obtained for crystal 2 and crystal 9 .",
    "for the plane perpendicular to the ( @xmath4111 ) direction , a few spots were observed marked by solid circles in fig .",
    "[ both](f ) , which are not allowed by the symmetry of the space group and are missing in fig .",
    "[ both](c ) .",
    "these extra features are extended and have intensity @xmath45 times that of the bragg reflections .",
    "twinning or stacking faults of similiarly oriented crystals can cause such features to appear .",
    "but as seen from the spots outside the white polygon , the features are not present in the other brillouin zones with the same orientation .",
    "this excludes the possibility of periodic arrangement of such crystal defects .",
    "the slight broadening of the peaks in fig .",
    "[ both](e ) is also due to the stacking faults or to a slight misalignment of the crystal .    to test",
    "if the appearance of the extended extra features for crystal 9 is an artifact of the particular crystal or is intrinsic , we performed the same experiment on crystal 10 which was grown under similiar conditions and has a similiar magnetic defect concentration as that of crystal 9 .",
    "the x - ray diffraction pattern for the reciprocal lattice plane perpendicular to the ( @xmath4111 ) direction of crystal 10 is shown in fig .",
    "[ other ] .",
    "the extra extended spots present in fig .",
    "[ both](c ) are missing here .",
    "there are a few very weak spots other than the allowed ones for the plane perpendicular to ( @xmath4111 ) direction .",
    "these are caused by other misaligned crystals of the same material or impurities and show the very high sensitivity of the technique to the smallest deviations / differences in the pattern from the expected one for a perfect crystal . if we focus our beam onto a different spot on the same crystal surface , the extra peaks vary in intensity and/or disappear .",
    "no noticeable difference in the x - ray diffraction patterns of the reciprocal lattice planes of a crystal with high magnetic defect concentration and a crystal with low magnetic defect concentration has been found .",
    "this indicates the absence of any long - range periodicity or order in the arrangement of the crystal defects giving rise to the magnetic defects .",
    "we also did not observe any rod - like features or extra planes in reciprocal space and thus exclude any long - range low - dimensional order .",
    "no diffuse scattering was observed in the dynamic range of five orders of magnitude .",
    "this excludes the possibility of short - range order of the crystal defects .",
    "thus we conclude that the crystal defects in @xmath0 which produce the magnetic defects are randomly distributed within the spinel structure .",
