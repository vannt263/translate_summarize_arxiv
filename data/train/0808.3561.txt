    "@xcite initially reported a substantial asymmetry of faint blue stars in the first quadrant ( q1 ) of the inner galaxy , @xmath1 compared with complementary fields in the fourth quadrant ( q4 ) based on star counts from maps @xcite .",
    "@xcite made a more in - depth survey to map the extent of the asymmetry using 40 contiguous fields in each of three regions : q1 above and below the plane and q4 above the plane .",
    "q4 below the plane is not covered in the poss i. they found a 25% excess in the number of probable thick disk stars in q1 above _ and below the plane when compared to the complementary q4 fields .",
    "the region was irregular in shape and covered several hundred square degrees , but with a completeness limit at @xmath2 1818.5 mag , the stars showing the excess in q1 were relatively nearby , @xmath3 1  2 kpc from the sun .",
    "@xcite also found an associated kinematic signature , a significant lag of  80 to 90 km / sec in the direction of galactic rotation for the associated thick disk stars in q1 . _    the recent release of the sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) photometry in the direction of the observed asymmetry in q1 led to the discovery of a feature at much fainter magnitudes , the distant hercules - aquila cloud @xcite and the photometric parallax study by @xcite confirmed our nearer asymmetry in the inner galaxy as an overdensity at a galactocentric radius of 6.5 kpc situated 1.5 kpc above the plane .",
    "the sdss survey however is not well designed for a good study of the thick disk inside the solar orbit .",
    "it extends below @xmath4 in only a few directions in q1 and has only limited coverage in q4 .",
    "we are continuing our program of photometric and spectroscopic observations to map the size and extent of the asymmetry along our line of sight and to determine the degree of spatial and kinematic asymmetry above and below the plane .",
    "we are using the smarts consortium ctio 1-meter y4kcam and the steward observatory 90 \" bok telescope 90prime mosaic imager to obtain wide - field multi - color ccd imaging to fainter completeness limits than the poss i. spectra of the candidate thick disk stars for radial velocities and metallicity estimates have been observed using the hydra multi - object spectrometer on the ctio blanco 4-meter telescopes and the hectospec on the mmto 6.5 meter .    in this letter",
    "we present a stellar number density map we created from the maps poss i scans to provide a more global reference for our current deeper but more spatially restricted photometric and spectroscopic study of the thick disk in the inner galaxy .",
    "other works @xcite have used plate data to supplement gaps in the sdss at more southern declinations with good success .",
    "our map of the stellar density in q1 and q4 covers much of the sky unavailable to sdss and demonstrates that the nearby asymmetry in q1 does not represent a ring above the galactic plane , but instead is a significant substructure or cloud extending over many square degrees in galactic longitude and latitude .",
    "we call this feature the hercules thick disk cloud .",
    "the figures presented in this letter were originally created to provide a reference frame for the interpretation of our ongoing observations of the thick disk using narrower yet deep multicolor ccd imaging .",
    "they were made using the same set of poss i fields selected by @xcite above the galactic plane and the fields are fully described in that publication .",
    "the 80 poss i plates cover 2900 square degrees on the sky and all are complete to fainter than 18th magnitude in the o band ( blue ) and have colors ( o  e ) available from the paired observation in the red ( e band ) .",
    "their placement on the sky is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] for q1 and for figure  [ fig2 ] for q4 .",
    "the b - v extinction in each field is plotted from @xcite and is substantially less than @xmath5 in all fields .",
    "we defer a discussion of the q1 data below the plane to a later paper because it is not relevant to the present letter .",
    "the maps catalog has superior stellar photometry when compared with most other digitized plate catalogs of the poss because each plate has its own independent photometric calibration derived from our own ccd observations as described in @xcite or from photoelectric photometry @xcite and uses an isophotal diameter - to - magnitude relation for the stars .",
    "the individual plate catalogs were merged , duplicates in the plate overlap regions removed , and interstellar extinction from @xcite was applied on a star by star basis using the standard interstellar extinction law .",
    "we assume that the bulk of the extinction comes from relatively near the sun and that our objects of interest are much farther away , so that the extinction is a zero point correction .",
    "a global geometric vignetting correction was applied to all of the plates in the maps catalog .",
    "however , we found that some plates had larger vignetting problems ( probably due to moonlight ) . as a result we applied an additional radial magnitude correction to the maps magnitudes for 5 of the 80 plates to bring the number densities at the plate edges into line with the well behaved and well calibrated plate center .",
    "star - galaxy classification uses a neural network @xcite and is described in those papers and in @xcite .",
    "any uncertainty in object classification is not a significant factor in the creation of these maps .",
    "we then selected stars in the magnitude range @xmath6 ( or approximately @xmath7 ) above the completeness limits . since the plates still have some magnitude zero point differences and cosmic scatter , we used the  blue ridgeline \" at @xmath8 or @xmath9 as a fiducial reference to select a sample of stars with blue and intermediate colors ( see * ? ? ? * fig.5 ) .",
    "stars bluer than the ridgeline are representative of the stars which show the asymmetry @xcite .",
    "while the exact location of the blue ridge in o - e color varies somewhat from plate to plate and with galactic longitude and latitude , due to the relative contributions of stars from the halo , disk and thick disk , it provides a strongly identifiable feature on each color - magnitude diagram ( see figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the color variations between adjacent plates will thus be small compared to the variations across the full 180 degrees of sky covered .",
    "our magnitude and color search limits are illustrated on one of our color magnitude diagrams shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "after the reduction steps outlined above , we then binned the stars @xmath10 in _ l _ and _ b _ to create maps of the stellar density distribution of the faint blue and intermediate color stars shown in figures  [ fig5 ] and  [ fig6 ]",
    ". the figures are color - coded with respect to number density per 0.0625 square degree .",
    "@xcite described the excess in q1 as due to a ",
    "ringlike \" structure because the overdensity appeared to be radially constant and circular in cross section in their figure 27 .",
    "the center of the overdensity region ranges from @xmath11 to @xmath12 and can easily be converted into galactic coordinates .",
    "this is shown as the purple line on figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "if the feature were symmetric about @xmath13 it would project into q4 to @xmath14 .",
    "this projection is also shown as a purple line on figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "comparison of figures  [ fig5 ] and  [ fig6 ] , however show that the density of these stars is not symmetric with respect to the sun - center line .",
    "there is a clear excess of stars in q1 over q4 in the range _",
    "_ @xmath15  @xmath16 and _ b _ @xmath17  @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , we emphasize that the excess would not have been initially discovered if it had been a symmetric ring since we @xcite were comparing star counts for complementary fields in q1 and q4 .",
    "could the  ringlike \" structure be inclined to the plane and therefore not visible in q4 ?",
    "most probably not .",
    "the full height of the overdensity in z over an azimuthal distance of 2500 parsecs is only 500 pc ( juricc et al . ) . even for the pathological case of a paper thin inclined distribution in z the maximum inclination",
    "could only be 11 degrees and given its width in x it should have been visible in figure  [ fig6 ] . additionally , there is strong evidence from juri et al.s figure 27 ( left panel ) that for x = 7250 - 7750 parsecs the overdensity is exclusively above @xmath19 pc .",
    "examination of the same figure s middle panel shows that all significant contributors to the overdensity in this same x range have @xmath20 pc",
    ". this would be the opposite of what should be happening if the overdensity were falling into the plane in q4 . finally , @xcite studied the velocities of samples of stars taken from overdensity regions in q1 compared with a control sample q4 and found in a somewhat weak result that the z component of velocity was less negative for q1 than it was for q4 .",
    "if a coherent population of stars were moving together towards the disk from above the plane as they entered q4 , the opposite should be true .    the cloud of stars detected by juri et al .",
    "is not symmetric about the @xmath13 line and almost certainly is not a ring .",
    "this does not change their other possible explanation for the feature , however .",
    "given the broad extent of the cloud ( figures  [ fig5 ] and  [ fig6 ] ) together with its apparent small ranges in radial distance from the sun and its distance above the galactic plane ( their figure 27 ) , the hercules thick disk cloud may be a debris stream consistent with the disk formation scenario described by @xcite .",
    "while the hercules thick disk cloud is relatively nearby on the sky it is not related to the more distant ( 10 - 20 kpc ) hercules - aquila cloud of @xcite .",
    "the northern extent of the hercules - aquila cloud ( figure 2 in @xcite ) is confined to galactic latitudes less than @xmath21 and even in those regions the bulk of the stars are much fainter than our magnitude limit",
    ". the contamination of our sample by hercules - aquila cloud stars would be less than 5 objects per square degree ( 0.5 stars / bin ) in any case given our relatively bright magnitude limits .",
    "other explanations are still possible such as a triaxial thick disk and an overdensity due to an interaction with the disk bar .",
    "analysis of our ccd photometry and spectroscopy for fainter stars in q1 and q4 will be used to address this question .",
