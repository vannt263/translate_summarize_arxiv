    "we are carrying out an exoplanet search to exploit the `` m dwarf opportunity . ''",
    "approximately 70% of main sequence stars are m dwarfs , spanning a factor of 5 in mass / radius and @xmath210@xmath3 in luminosity . due to their smaller masses and radii and cooler temperatures compared to fgk stars ,",
    "transiting exoplanets produced deeper eclipses of m dwarfs , exoplanet habitable zones are closer , and exoplanet radial velocity amplitude reflex motions are larger .",
    "more recently , a new `` m dwarf opportunity '' for finding exoplanets has been identified with the kepler mission  not only are planets smaller than 4 @xmath4 more common than jovian planets , they are predominantly found around lower mass stars ( howard et al .",

    "there are several factors spoiling the `` m dwarf opportunity . ''",
    "first , m dwarfs are red and faint , with @xmath5 mag and only 4 m4 or later dwarfs with @xmath6 mag . additionally , small planetary rv signals are comparable in amplitude and time - scale to numerous periodic perturbing stellar jitter signals such as rotational spot modulation & magnetic activity cycles ( vanderberg et al . 2015 , robertson et al . 2015 ) .",
    "one solution to both of these challenges is to observe in the nir , where m dwarfs put out much of their bolometric luminosity , and the amplitude of stellar jitter is diminished ( reiners et al .",

    "we have obtained our goal precision of @xmath230 - 60 m / s in our young m dwarf survey from 2010 - 2012 , and @xmath220 - 30 m / s in 2014 at higher snr for nearby m dwarfs not previously surveyed by visible rv teams .",
    "we present a sample rv curve and our survey results in figure 1 .",
    "we are in the process of publishing our detailed survey results .",
    "looking towards the future , we have made the gas cells for ishell ( r@xmath275,000 , spectral grasp of 250 nm ) , which will replace cshell in 2016 .",
    "we expect to get to @xmath7 5 m / s precision with ishell due to the increased spectral grasp alone ( figure 2 ) . the increased efficiency , resolution , no fringing , and smaller number of bad pixels will provide further improvements .",
