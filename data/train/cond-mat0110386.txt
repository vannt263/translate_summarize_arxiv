    "density functional theory ( dft ) has proven itself a remarkably successful tool in condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "the foundations were laid in 1964 , when hohenberg and kohn ( hk)@xcite proved that the ground state energy of any quantum mechanical system could be described as a functional of the one - body density only .",
    "subsequently , kohn and sham@xcite developed an orbital based method which could be applied to electronic systems , and mermin@xcite extended the hk proof to finite temperatures , opening up the possibility of using dft to calculate the free - energy of a statistical mechanical system .",
    "since then many different practical methods have been developed to apply dft to electronic problems , with countless applications in condensed matter physics , chemistry , and biology@xcite .",
    "examples of electronic structure techniques relevant to this paper are the _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) method of car and parrinello@xcite and the orbital free _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( of - aimd ) scheme of madden and co - workers@xcite . in a parallel development ,",
    "the finite temperature version of dft has been widely used to study classical systems , with myriad applications to phase - transitions and the theory of fluids ( in its broadest sense ) , see e.g.@xcite for reviews .",
    "however , the classical and quantum versions of dft have rarely been combined  the two fields have largely developed independently . in this paper",
    "we will attempt to bring together these two strands of dft into one unified formalism , with the aim of applying them to liquid metals .",
    "these are ideal systems for which to test a mixed quantum - classical dft approach since they can be viewed as binary mixtures of classical ions and quantum electrons .    to begin",
    ", we first define a two - component free - energy functional @xmath0 = f_i^{id}[\\rho_i ] + f_e^{id}[\\rho_e ] +   f^{ex}[\\rho_i,\\rho_e],\\ ] ] split into the usual way between the ideal free energies of the ions , @xmath1 , and the electrons , @xmath2 , and the excess free energy @xmath3 , which is a functional of both one - body densities @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this unique intrinsic free - energy functional functional obeys the variational principle : @xmath6}{\\delta \\rho_\\alpha({\\bf r } ) } + \\phi_\\alpha({\\bf r } ) = 0,\\ ] ] where the @xmath7 are the external potentials which uniquely induce the one - body densities @xmath8 .",
    "this principle is subject to the constraint that the integral of @xmath9 , the total number of particles of species @xmath10 .",
    "we will apply this free - energy functional both to homogeneous and to inhomogeneous liquid metals .",
    "in section  [ section2 ] we use the dft formulation to derive the quantum ornstein zernike(qoz ) equations . from these",
    "we can derive a set of integral equations , called the quantum hypernetted chain approximation(qhnc ) by chihara@xcite , which self - consistently solves for the ion - ion and ion - electron pair correlation functions in a homogeneous liquid metal .",
    "the great simplification of the qhnc approach is that the original many - centre electronic problem is reduced to an effective one - centre problem , which is much easier to solve . as a specific application",
    ", we study the ion - electron radial distribution function for a set of simple metals .    in section  [ section3 ]",
    "we extend this dft formulation to inhomogeneous fluids . by using a simple version of this functional",
    ", we compare the electron density profile at the liquid - solid interface of al to the recent simulations using of - aimd@xcite .",
    "we end with some conclusions .",
    "dft provides a nicely unified route to the correlation functions of homogeneous fluids . to begin",
    ", we first show how to derive the qoz relations by defining the direct correlation function as the second functional derivative of the excess free - energy defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the inverse susceptibility matrix of the full system , and @xmath13 is the inverse susceptibility matrix of the ideal system . these relationships between direct correlation functions and inverse susceptibilities are called the qoz equations , and they hold for an arbitrary number of components . if any components are classical , then the susceptibilities can be connected to the pair - correlations through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem@xcite : @xmath14 where the @xmath15 are the structure factors , defined in the usual way@xcite , and we have taken the homogeneous limit and the @xmath16 are the homogeneous limits of the densities @xmath8 .",
    "specializing to the homogeneous limit for two components , with one component being classical ( the case at hand ) , the qoz equations reduce to a set of relationships between the direct correlation functions and the the ion - ion and ion - electron pair correlation functions as well as the electron - electron susceptibilities .",
    "the latter are still quantum - mechanical , and can not be simply connected to electron - electron pair correlations .      to make further progress",
    ", one needs a way of solving the qoz relations for a liquid metal .",
    "we sketch the derivation here , for more details we refer to reference@xcite and to the original work of chihara@xcite . as a first step , we use a quantum version of the percus trick@xcite to relate the _ homogeneous _ two - body pair - correlation functions to the one - body _ inhomogeneous _ density around a single classical particle fixed at the origin . for the ion - electron pair - correlation function",
    "we fix an ion at the origin to find : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the ( interacting ) valence electron density@xcite .",
    "a similar relationship can be found for the ion - ion pair - correlation function , but this trick can not be used for the electron - electron pair - correlation function , since one can not `` fix '' an electron at one position . the next step is to solve for the interacting one - body electron - density . to do this , one can use the kohn - sham trick@xcite , namely that there exists a single - particle external potential @xmath19 which will induce in a _ non - interacting _ system the same one - particle density @xmath20 as is found in the full _ interacting _ system .",
    "this external effective potential , felt by the non - interacting electrons or non - interacting ions , follows from the euler equations .",
    "if one further makes a functional taylor expansion around the equilibrium homogeneous densities , then the following effective ion - ion and ion - electron potentials result : @xmath21 where the @xmath22 are the homogeneous limits of the direct correlation functions defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.1 ] ) , and the percus trick was used to rewrite @xmath23 in terms of the correlation functions @xmath24",
    "= @xmath25 .",
    "the remaining higher order terms are lumped into the so - called _ bridge functions _",
    "@xmath26 , well known in the theory of liquids@xcite .",
    "again , we note that no such potential can be derived for the electron -electron correlations . with that caveat in mind ,",
    "our formulation , derived from a dft approach , is still in principle exact .    to make progress ,",
    "however , some approximations must be made , in particular to treat the electron - electron correlations .",
    "we follow chihara , who made a series of such approximations to derive the qhnc equations@xcite .",
    "the most important one is :    1 .   _",
    "the valence electron correlations are treated in the jellium approximation_. i.e.  the effect of the ion - ion and ion - electron correlations on the electron - electron correlations are ignored , and the electron - electron direct - correlation function is written as : @xmath27,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the local field factor for the electron gas@xcite .",
    "this has the great advantage that the qoz relations  ( [ eq2.1 ] ) now reduce to only two coupled equations for the ion - ion and the ion - electron correlations . while this is the key approximation that makes the qoz relations tractable , it is also the most important and uncontrolled approximation in the qhnc scheme .",
    "the fact that the effective pair potentials derived from a linear response scheme@xcite are very sensitive to the exact form of the local field factor also testifies to the importance of the approximations in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.5 ] ) to the physics of a liquid metal .",
    "+ qhnc also uses an implicit separation of the valence electrons from the core electrons .",
    "this approximation is closely related to the jellium approximation discussed above , and is only good when the core and valence electron energy levels are well separated so that the ionic correlations do nt have a significant effect on the core states ; it is likely to break down near resonances .",
    "+ the other approximations used in qhnc are much better understood , and are often encountered in either their electronic structure@xcite or liquid state theory context@xcite . in descending order of importance they are ( for a more detailed discussion see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) : 2 .   _ the local density approximation ( lda ) is used for the one - centre ion - electron problem_. this approximation is well known and understood in electronic - structure theory@xcite . although in principle this approximation is similar to approximation 1 for @xmath29 , since the exchange and correlation energy of an inhomogeneous electron gas are approximated by the local energy density of jellium , there are a number of reasons to believe the lda is rather accurate@xcite . various improvements to the lda",
    "exist , but these are not thought to be very important for the simple metals we study .",
    "the ion - electron bridge function @xmath30 is set to 0 , which is related to the hypernetted - chain approximation , well known in liquid state theory @xcite .",
    "the ion - ion bridge function @xmath31 is approximated by the bridge - function of a hard - sphere reference state .",
    "this is called the rhnc or mhnc approximation in liquid state theory@xcite , and is generally very accurate .",
    "the bare ion - ion potential is taken to be purely coulombic . again , this is an approximation whose limitations are well understood@xcite .    in summary",
    "then , the qhnc approximation achieves the following very important simplification for the electronic problem : the original many - centre electronic problem has been reduced to an effective one - centre problem by replacing the direct effect of the ions with an effective external potential , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq2.4 ] ) , that depends self - consistently on the ion - ion correlations .",
    "this is depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : qhnc - schematic ] .",
    "the main advantages are that the ion - ion and ion - electron correlations emerge naturally and on the same footing and that the calculations are much more rapid than full _ ab initio _ simulations . by using dft to derive the qhnc equations ,",
    "their origin and meaning becomes more transparent . for details on the ( non - trivial ) numerical implementation of the qhnc we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the ion - electron radial distribution function , defined as the conditional probability of finding a valence electron a distance @xmath32 away , given that there is an ion at the origin , can be written as : @xmath33where @xmath34 is the so - called `` pseudo - atom '' density , which , when superimposed according the ion - ion radial - distribution function @xmath35 , gives the correct value of the total electron - density . the ion - electron radial distribution function and the related pseudo - atom density , calculated with the qhnc approach ,",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gei ] for a series of simple metals . at short distances",
    "the probability of finding an electron a distance @xmath32 away is equal to the pseudo - atom density , but further away the effects of the other surrounding pseudo - atoms kick in .",
    "note that the qhnc is an all - electron calculation ; the oscillations near the core are correctly reproduced@xcite , in contrast to the traditional aimd approaches , which rely on pseudopotentials .",
    "the ion - electron correlation functions calculated with the qhnc compare very well for the cases where aimd simulations are available .",
    "however , it turns out that for most of the metals in our set a much simple linear response formalism also performs remarkably well@xcite .",
    "the surprising accuracy of the linear response arises from a quantum interference effect between two length - scales : the fermi wave - vector and the core - size of the ions , which makes the non - linear response terms much less important than one might naively expect@xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the qhnc also benefits from this effect .    0.1 cm    the only metal in our set where the qhnc has difficulty is ga .",
    "we found earlier@xcite that an ad - hoc change in the local field factor @xmath36 seems to improve matters .",
    "we also found that the d - electrons are close to a resonance .",
    "these two points indicate that approximation 1 , discussed in the previous section , begins to break down for ga .",
    "in this section we explore the possibilities of studying inhomogeneous metals within a two - component dft formulation .",
    "the advantage of treating metals directly as as electron - ion mixtures in this way is that we bypass the need for effective ( density dependent ) ion - ion potentials .",
    "modern classical dft methods use input from the homogeneous liquid state@xcite ; the qhnc is ideally suited to provide such input for a two - component dft .",
    "one of the simplest approximations for the dft of an inhomogeneous system , first proposed by ramakrishnan and yussouf(ry)@xcite , corresponds to truncating at second order a functional taylor expansion of the excess free - energy around the homogeneous phase : @xmath37 = - \\sum_{\\alpha } \\sum_{\\beta }   \\int d{\\bf r } \\int d{\\bf r } ' \\delta \\rho_\\alpha({\\bf r } ) c_{\\alpha \\beta } ( \\rho_\\alpha^0 , \\rho_\\beta^0 ; |{\\bf r } - { \\bf r}'| ) \\delta",
    "\\rho_\\beta({\\bf r}'),\\ ] ] where @xmath38 - f_0^{ex}(\\{\\rho_\\alpha^0\\})$ ] , and the direct correlation functions @xmath39 are those of the homogeneous liquid phase . for metals ,",
    "the qhnc provides @xmath40 and @xmath41 , while @xmath42 is fixed by the jellium approximation .",
    "together , these correlation functions completely determine the excess free - energy of eq.([eq3.1 ] ) .    to obtain the total free - energy ,",
    "one then adds the ideal contributions of the electrons and the ions . for the ions , this ideal free energy functional",
    "has the form : @xmath43 = \\int d{\\bf r } \\rho_i({\\bf r } ) \\left\\ { \\ln \\left [ \\rho_i({\\bf r } ) \\lambda ^3 \\right ] -1 \\right\\},\\ ] ] but for the electrons the exact form is not known , and various approximations must be made . to preserve the advantages of the current dft approach",
    ", one needs a kinetic energy functional .",
    "a number of forms have been proposed ; some are remarkably accurate , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein",
    ". these kinetic energy functionals also vary in the ease with which they can be implemented in a full two - component dft calculation@xcite .",
    "classical dft has frequently been applied to the freezing transition and the fluid - solid interface of simple fluids@xcite .",
    "the two - component dft described above provides a basis upon which to build similar applications for metallic systems .    as a first application",
    ", we attempted to use the two - component ry formalism described above to calculate the freezing transition of al . a very similar approach was already implemented by one of us@xcite to study the freezing transition of h. however there a simpler semi - empirical prescription was used for @xmath41 . since @xmath44 does not have a core radius , the cancellation of higher order response terms found for simple metals@xcite does not hold .",
    "this implies that the correlation functions and also the freezing transition of @xmath44 should be more difficult to treat accurately than would be the case for simple metals .",
    "other properties of liquid @xmath44 , such as the metal - insulator transition@xcite are also much harder to treat .",
    "partially for these reasons , we would initially expect that the simple metals are actually better systems on which to test rudimentary dft s .",
    "the one - body densities of the solid phase are parameterized by sums over the reciprocal lattice vectors ( r.l.v . )",
    "@xmath45 : @xmath46.\\ ] ] for the ions a further , well established , simplification is to take the real - space density @xmath4 as a sum of gaussians , centred on the lattice sites , which implies @xmath47 $ ] . with this density parameterization and approximation , the full free - energy functional for the difference between the solid and the liquid state free energy , taken from eqs .",

    "the first term between brackets is the ideal free - energy of the ions  ( [ eq3.2 ] ) , written out in terms of the gaussian parameter @xmath51 .",
    "this free - energy can then be minimized through the variational principle  ( [ eq1.2 ] ) to solve for the free - energy difference between a given solid crystal structure and the fluid phase . however , when we attempted this for al , with the direct correlation functions given by the qhnc , we found that the free energy of the solid did not have a stable minimum .",
    "this is a common problem encountered when applying a dft to the freezing transition ( see e.g. ref  @xcite ) : if the full direct correlation functions are used , then it is very hard to stabilize solid phase .",
    "if instead one uses the dft for a hard - sphere reference system , adding the attractive interactions as a perturbation , very good agreement with experiment and simulation is recovered .",
    "examples include phase diagram@xcite and the fluid - solid interface of the lj fluid@xcite , and a one - component treatment of the freezing of al@xcite , based on an effective pair potential .",
    "this suggests that a successful 2-component dft treatment of the freezing transition also needs to pass via this route .",
    "unfortunately this quickly reduces to a theory similar to the one - component dft , which means introducing the effective pair potentials we are trying to avoid in the first place .",
    "another application of the two - component dft formalism is to examine the fluid - solid interface of al , for which besson and madden@xcite have recently completed extensive of - aimd simulations .",
    "they found non - trivial behaviour , with the ion - ion density profiles decaying from an ordered structure to a smooth liquid structure across several atomic layers .",
    "similarly , they found that the valence electron density also showed oscillations which decayed into the bulk liquid phase . in principle , a two - component dft would be ideally suited to study this problem , since the ionic and electronic density profiles come out on equal footing .",
    "unfortunately , the difficulties encountered when trying to treat the freezing transition also make studying this problem very difficult .",
    "instead , we tackle a simpler problem : given the ionic density profile , can we use our dft to calculate the electron density profile ?",
    "if the ionic density profiles are given , which fixes the @xmath52 , then the electronic @xmath53 which satisfy the variational principle  ( [ eq1.2 ] ) follow from eq .",
    "( [ eq3.4 ] ) : @xmath54 where we have made an additional approximation , also made in @xcite , namely that the ideal electron contribution @xmath55 $ ] is expanded to second order in @xmath56 ( linear response ) .",
    "this is consistent with the spirit of the ry dft approach , and greatly simplifies the minimization of the electronic degrees of freedom , since they are now linearly coupled to the ionic ones .",
    "note that taking the lowest order approximation to the ion - electron direct correlation function , @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ eq3.7 ] ) would be equivalent to a standard linear response calculation .",
    "since we use the full @xmath41 , non - linear response terms are included , although one would need to use the full kinetic energy functional to be completely consistent with the ry dft approach of eq .",
    "( [ eq3.4 ] ) .",
    "the results of using eq.([eq3.7 ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hong2 ] as a function of the distance @xmath58 along the interface .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details of parameters ) .",
    "the qhnc results are in fact less accurate than a simpler linear - response approximation which replaces @xmath59 , with an empty - core ashcroft pseudopotential@xcite . at first this",
    "may seem surprising , but a careful look at the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : hong2 ] shows that the difference results from the fact that @xmath59 is considerably smaller at @xmath60 , where the strongest ionic scattering occurs .",
    "this difference stems in part from the fact that the true pseudopotential in al is known to be highly non - local@xcite because of the @xmath61 character of the bonds , suggesting that a local formulation , such as the simple linear response dft we employed , will not work well together with the qhnc calculation which makes no local pseudopotential assumptions .",
    "non - linear response effects are also expected to be more important at the highly inhomogeneous fluid - fluid interface .",
    "in contrast to the qhnc , the pseudo - potential contains an empirically adjustable parameter which effectively includes non - local and non - linear effects . to achieve accurate results with a dft based on the qhnc",
    ", one needs to treat the two approaches at comparable levels of approximation . as is often encountered in condensed - matter physics ,",
    "mixing different levels of approximation does not work very well .",
    "two ways of improving this would be * ( 1 ) * to use qhnc with the improved local pseudopotentials used in the ofmd@xcite or * ( 2 ) * to use a more sophisticated dft approach .",
    "although far from complete or completely satisfactory , this first , and rather primitive , example of a two - component dft used for a liquid - solid interface suggests that our dft approach could in principle be fruitfully used to study fluid - solid interfaces in simple metals .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown how dft provides a unified formalism from which to derive the qoz equations , and the related qhnc approach , first pioneered by chihara .",
    "the qhnc reduces the many - centre electronic problem to an effective one - centre one .",
    "this dramatically reduces the computational time needed to calculate ion - electron and ion - ion correlation functions .",
    "it also has the advantage that no explicit use of effective pair potentials or pseudo - potentials is needed .",
    "the most important approximation in the qhnc approach is to treat the electron - electron correlations as those of jellium .",
    "it is not yet clear under which conditions this approximation begins to break down . with this caveat in mind ,",
    "the other approximations entering the qhnc are reasonably well understood .",
    "we used the qhnc to calculate the ion - electron radial distribution functions for a number of simple metals , finding very good agreement with ab - initio molecular dynamics calculations where these are available .",
    "we have also discussed an exploratory application of the simple ry dft approach to liquid metals as two - component electron - ion mixtures . we found that describing the freezing transition suffers from a similar problem to that found for classical simple fluids : the solid phase does not develop a stable minimum if the full direct correlation functions are used as input .",
    "this is rather disappointing .",
    "slightly more ( partial ) success was found when we attempted to use the dft to describe the inhomogeneous electron density at a liquid - solid al interface .",
    "although this result was only a partial application of the dft , since the ionic density profile came from the simulations , it does suggest that developing a full fledged dft could be very fruitful .",
    "finally , it is clear that our rudimentary dft approach is not yet accurate enough , and could be improved in a number of ways .",
    "we are attempting to generalize more sophisticated dft schemes like the mdwa@xcite or gela@xcite to the two - component ion - electron problem .",
    "we are also studying the effect of using different local field factors and different kinetic energy functionals .",
