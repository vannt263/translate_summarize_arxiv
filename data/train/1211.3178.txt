    "quantum annealing ( qa ) algorithms can be useful for solving many hard problems related to finding the global minimum of multi - valued functions , cost functions , optimal configurations of complex networks , and the ground states of the corresponding hamiltonians .",
    "the main idea of qa is to utilize the collective quantum tunneling effects enabling complex systems to tunnel during the slow time - evolution from local minima to the global ground state .",
    "although many useful results have been obtained in this field , many problems still need to be resolved .",
    "the main challenge is to accelerate the speed of qa algorithms so that the annealing time grows not exponentially but polynomially with the size of the problem @xcite .",
    "there are many approaches to finding the ground state of the hamiltonian , @xmath2 , using qa algorithms @xcite .",
    "one of these approaches is based on introducing a time - dependent hamiltonian , @xmath3 , where @xmath2 is the hamiltonian to be optimized , @xmath4 is an auxiliary (  initial \" ) hamiltonian and @xmath5 \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "the term @xmath6 provides the non - trivial quantum dynamics required during annealing .",
    "the external time - dependent field , @xmath7 , is a control parameter that decreases from a large enough value to zero during the evolution .",
    "the ground state of @xmath4 is the initial state .",
    "if @xmath7 decreases sufficiently slowly , the adiabatic theorem guarantees finding the ground state of the main hamiltonian , @xmath2 , at the end of computation .    in order to reach the desired ground state , qa algorithms usually require the existence of a finite gap between the ground state and first excited state .",
    "however , in typical cases the minimal gap , @xmath8 , is exponentially small in the number of qubits , @xmath9 .",
    "for instance , in the commonly used quantum optimization @xmath9-qubit models the minimal energy gap is @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this causes the annealing time to increase exponentially with the size of the system .",
    "then , the problem arises on how to speed up the performance of the qa algorithms and , at the same time , find the ground state of @xmath2 .",
    "in @xcite we proposed an alternate adiabatic quantum optimization algorithm based on the non - hermitian quantum mechanics .",
    "recently , we applied this non - hermitian quantum annealing ( nqa ) algorithm to grover s problem of finding a marked item in an unsorted database @xcite .",
    "we showed that a search time depends on the chosen relaxation parameters , and is proportional to the logarithm of the number of qubits .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the nqa to study a dissipative dynamics in the one - dimensional ferromagnetic ising spin chain .",
    "we assume that the dissipation vanishes at the end of evolution .",
    "so , after the annealing is finished , the system is governed by the hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "we show that a dissipation significantly increases the probability for the system to remain in the ground state .",
    "in particular , a comparison with the results of the hermitian qa reveals that the nqa reaches the ground state of @xmath2 with much larger probability , if we use the same annealing scheme .",
    "we show that the nqa has a complexity of order , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of spins .",
    "this is much better than the quantum hermitian adiabatic algorithm yielding the complexity of order @xmath11 .",
    "a dissipative term which we use corresponds to a tunneling of the system to its own continuum , as usually happens when one applies a feshbach projection method on intrinsic states in nuclear physics and quantum optics . in our case ,",
    "the intrinsic states are the states of the quantum computer .",
    "so , the absolute probability of our quantum computer to survive during the nqa can be small .",
    "that is why we use a ratio of two probabilities  the probability for the system to remain in the ground state to the probability of survival of the quantum computer .",
    "this relative probability ( we call it `` intrinsic '' probability ) is well - defined , and remains finite during the nqa .",
    "so , our approach can not be directly used in the experiments on qa , but rather as a combination of classical computer and nqa to significantly decrease the time of annealing .",
    "also , a dissipative term which we use in this paper is rather artificial in a sense that it has no a direct relation to a real physical dissipative mechanisms . at the same time",
    ", we note that our dissipation term corresponds , in principal , to the tunneling effects in the superconducting phase qubits if tunneling is realized mostly from the lowest energy levels .",
    "our hope is that a reduction of the calculation annealing time can help to boost solution of the np - complete problems by using combination of classical computers and nqa algorithms .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the generic adiabatic quantum optimization ( aqo ) algorithm based on non - hermitian qa is discussed . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce a lossy one - dimensional ising system in a transverse magnetic field governed by a non - hermitian hamiltonian . in sec .",
    "iv , we study the quench dynamics of our system using both analytic and numerical methods .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "v with a discussion of our results . in the appendices we present some technical details .",
    "the generic adiabatic quantum optimization problem based on the qa algorithm can be formulated as follows @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be the hamiltonian whose ground state is to be found , and @xmath4 be an auxiliary `` initial '' hamiltonian .",
    "we consider the following time - dependent hamiltonian : @xmath12 where @xmath5 \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "the function , @xmath13 , is monotonic and satisfies the relation , @xmath14 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath4 is dominant at the initial time @xmath15 , and , since @xmath14 , the @xmath16 as @xmath17 .",
    "the evolution of the system is determined by the schrdinger equation : @xmath18 the initial conditions are imposed as follows : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the ground state of @xmath4 .",
    "the adiabatic theorem guarantees that the initial state , @xmath21 , evolves into the final state of @xmath22 , which is the ground state of the hamiltonian , @xmath2 , as long as the instantaneous ground state of @xmath23 does not become degenerate at any time .",
    "the validity of the adiabatic theorem requires @xmath24 this restriction is violated near the degeneracies in which the eigenvalues coalesce . in the common case of double degeneracy with two linearly independent eigenvectors ,",
    "the energy surfaces form the sheets of a double cone .",
    "the apex of the cones is called the `` diabolic point '' , and since , for a generic hermitian hamiltonian , the co - dimension of the diabolic point is three , it can be characterized by three parameters @xcite . for the quantum optimization governed by the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ qa1 ] ) , the requirement ( [ qa2 ] ) can be written as @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the energy of the first excited state , @xmath28 .",
    "thus , if at the time , @xmath29 , the gap , @xmath30 , is small enough , the time required to pass from the initial state to the final state becomes very large , and the aqo loses its advantage over thermal annealing .",
    "recently @xcite , we proposed a generic non - hermitian adiabatic quantum optimization . here",
    "we consider a particular case of the nqa .",
    "let @xmath2 be a hamiltonian whose ground state is to be found , and let , @xmath31 be the non - hermitian auxiliary `` initial '' hamiltonian .",
    "consider the following time - dependent hamiltonian : @xmath32 where @xmath33 \\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "we impose the initial conditions as follows : @xmath34 , so that @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the energy of the ground state of the auxiliary non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath37 . at the end of evolution",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath38 , and the adiabatic theorem provides that the final state be the ground state of @xmath2 , if the evolution was slow enough .",
    "we denote by @xmath39 and @xmath40 the right and left instantaneous eigenvectors of the total hamiltonian : @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "we assume that these eigenvectors form a bi - orthonormal basis , @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "for the non - hermitian quantum optimization problem governed by the hamiltonian ( [ nqa4 ] ) , the validity of adiabatic approximation requires @xmath44 where the `` dot '' denotes the derivative with respect to the dimensionless time , @xmath26 .",
    "this restriction is violated near the ground state degeneracy , where complex energy levels cross .",
    "the point of degeneracy is known as the exceptional point , and it is characterized by a coalescence of eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors , as well .",
    "therefore , studying the behavior of the system in the vicinity of the exceptional point requires a special care @xcite .    in the vicinity of the level crossing point",
    ", only the two - dimensional jordan block , related to the level crossing , makes the most considerable contribution to the quantum evolution .",
    "then , the multi - dimentional problem can be described by the effective two - dimensional hamiltonian , acting in the subspace spanned by the ground state and the first excited state of the total non - hermitian hamiltonian , @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "in this section , we consider the one - dimensional ising model in a transverse magnetic field with dissipation governed by the following non - hermitian hamiltonian : @xmath46 with periodic boundary condition , @xmath47 .",
    "the external magnetic field is associated with the parameter , @xmath48 , the rate of decay is described by the parameter , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are the spin raising and lowering operators .    in principle , this model can be realized in a chain of the superconducting phase qubits with the tunneling to the continuum mostly from the lowest energy levels , and by applying the standard feshbach projection method to obtain effective non - hermitian hamiltonian . to get the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eqh1 ] ) one needs to make rotation along the axes @xmath51 by @xmath52 radians .",
    "we apply the standard jordan - wigner transformation , and the following procedure outlined in @xcite , @xmath53 in which @xmath54 are fermionic operators that satisfy anticommutation relations : @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "then , we obtain @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denote the projectors onto the subspaces with even @xmath59 and odd @xmath60 numbers of quasiparticles @xcite , and @xmath61 in which @xmath62 .    the hamiltonian , @xmath63 , is related to @xmath54 s with the periodic boundary conditions , @xmath64 , while in @xmath65 the operators , @xmath54 , obey the following ( ` antiperiodic ' ) boundary conditions : @xmath66 .",
    "since the parity of quasiparticles is conserved , one can consider only either @xmath65 or @xmath63 .",

    "one can show that the ground state can be written as a product of qubit - like states : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the vacuum state of the mode @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is the excited state : @xmath90 .",
    "since for each @xmath75 , the ground state lies into the two - dimensional hilbert space spanned by @xmath91 and @xmath92 , it is sufficient to project @xmath93 on this subspace . for a given value of @xmath75 ,",

    "recently , many modifications of quantum annealing algorithms have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the main objective of these publications is to significantly decrease the time of annealing , so that the solutions of hard optimization problems could be obtained either by ( i ) combining classical computers with quantum algorithms or by ( ii ) building real quantum computers .",
    "one of the very popular test models is the ising spin system which is also useful for practical purposes . in this case , the quantum annealing algorithms are used to find the ground state of this system .",

    "we have chosen an auxiliary hamiltonian in such a way that the total hamiltonian is non - hermitian .",
    "this allowed us to shift the minimal gap in the energy spectrum in the complex plane , and significantly reduce the time required to find the ground state .",
    "our approach leads to the annealing time @xmath287 , where @xmath1 is the number of spins , which is much less than the time of hermitian annealing ( @xmath288 ) for the same problem .",
    "but many serious problems still remain to be considered .",
    "one of them is the application of this dissipative approach to more complicated ising - type models with frustrated interactions , when the ground state can be strongly inhomogeneous .",
    "another direction is to use both dissipation and pumping into the system , as it was done in @xcite .",
