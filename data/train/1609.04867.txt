    "when heating vapor cells , the saturated vapor density increases , which can improve the sensitivity of spin - related measurements . on the other hand , heating can also deteriorate awc s performance or cause the coating material to melt ( for a typical paraffin awc , the melting point is around @xmath6 ) .",
    "high - temperature operation up to about @xmath7 was demonstrated with octadecyltrichlorosilane ( ots ) coatings@xcite , however , the authors report typical performance in terms of depolarization rates to be about several hundred wall collisions without depolarization .",
    "in addition , significant variation of awc properties was observed with a nominally uniform preparation procedure@xcite , which may be problematic for mass production of awc cells . although the properties of awc were studied extensively @xcite and some previous works specially focused on the relaxation properties of awc near the melting point@xcite , the effect of heating awc cells above the coating - material melting point on the magnetometric sensitivity remains insufficiently explored .    for atomic magnetometers ,",

    "the relative degree of the two kinds of polarization depends on the frequency tuning of the pump light . since the probe beam measures the orientation in the @xmath17 manifold , the optical rotation signal increases until it reaches an equilibrium value ( @xmath51 ) . in the case",

    "the slow relaxation rate appears to be independent of the pump power .",
    "the slight increase of the slow relaxation rate at near - zero pump powers is due to the increase of fitting errors .",

    "the dependence is measured with both high pump power ( @xmath58 ) and low pump power ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "for either case , both fast and slow relaxation rates increase with probe power due to the relaxation of the atomic orientation caused by the linearly polarized probe light .",
    "therefore , in the temperature - dependence measurement , we chose the probe power to be around @xmath56 to minimize the relaxation due to the probe light while maintaining a sufficient signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "figure  [ fig : relaxation_time ] shows the dependence of the slow relaxation rate on the coating temperature for different cells .",
    "in contrast to the vapor density s dependence on the stem temperature the relaxation rate depends mainly on the coating temperature , because the relaxation process is governed by the atom s interaction with the awc and collisions within the cell volume . for cell  a  g",

    "cell  h shows considerably larger slow relaxation rate compared to the other cells at low temperatures ; however , it attains comparable performance to the other cells above @xmath60 .",
    "the variation of the slow relaxation rate with regard to the temperature change coincides with the drawn - out melting and fusion profiles of pwmb measured with dsc @xcite .",
    "these show that pwmb is partially molten at temperatures from room temperature to about @xmath6 and completely melted at temperatures above @xmath60 .",
    "this indicates that melting degrades the awc to some extent .",
    "similar results were reported in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we could also verify that below @xmath62 , where the relaxation rate goes up to around 10  s@xmath61 , the coating can restore its antirelaxation properties when it is cooled down again .",
    "the fast relaxation rate is not shown in the figure because of the large fitting errors due to small signal - to - noise ratios for low beam powers .",
    "the amplitude for the fast relaxation becomes indistinguishable from noise at temperatures higher than @xmath63 , so that the transient of the optical rotation signal is well fitted with a single exponential function .",
    "according to fig .",
    "[ fig : relaxation_time ] , cells coated with wax distilled at a temperature of @xmath18 ( cell  c and d ) show smaller spin relaxation rates than cell  a and b whose coating material was distilled at @xmath64 .",
    "as for cell  e  h , since they have different geometries from those of cylindrical cells , we can compare their coating properties with the others by calculating the average number of bounces without depolarization .",

    "slow relaxation rates versus temperature .",
    "the measured relaxation rates are compared with the literature value for cs - cs spin - destruction relaxation rate @xmath67 [ see section  iii  c ] . ]",
    "as the cell temperature goes up , the increase of vapor density causes severe degradation of the amplitude of the optical rotation signal .",
    "therefore , in order to guarantee a sufficient signal - to - noise ratio which is crucial for a reliable fit , laser frequency detuning was changed for different temperatures .",
    "the laser frequency is locked near high - frequency wing of the absorption profile , which is shown in fig .",

    "similar effects have also been observed for other cells .",
    "reheating involves heating the cell to around @xmath68 for several hours while keeping the stem temperature a few degrees lower .",
    "the reason for this is that , while cells are being stored at room temperature or working at high temperature without maintaining a proper temperature difference between the stem and the volume , alkali atoms tend to form a film or clusters on top of awc which can cause deterioration of the relaxation properties . by reheating the cell while keeping the stem cooler",

    "previously , awc ( especially paraffin - coated ) cells were commonly thought to be unsuitable for high - temperature applications limited by the low melting point of the coating materials .",
    "we experimentally observe an increase in the figure of merit as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure_of_merit ] and demonstrate the potential of awc cells to work even at temperatures that correspond to partial melting of the coating material , with the potential to improve the sensitivity limit of atomic magnetometers .",
    "we note that even though the measured figure of merit is still about one order of magnitude below the spin - destruction limit for the highest temperatures used , the spin - destruction limit will potentially be reached at higher temperatures .",
    "once the figure of merit is ultimately limited by spin - destruction interactions , there will be no more gain in sensitivity with a further increase in vapor density because spin - destruction relaxation time scales as @xmath102 .",
    "since the spin - destruction limit is exactly the same limit as is ultimately achieved by serf magnetometers , we show the possibility of magnetometers based on awc cells to reach the same sensitivity .",
    "and one major advantage of such awc cells ( buffer - gas - free ) is that they are much less sensitive to magnetic field gradients@xcite and work for a wider range of magnetic fields .",
    "moreover , an additional advantage of magnetometers that work in the high - density regime is their faster response time , which may be helpful for detection of time - varying fields@xcite .",
    "we have focused our discussion on magnetometry applications ; however , the results are applicable also to other devices utilizing coated cells , including rotation sensors , electrometers , and secondary frequency standards .",
    "future work includes extending the temperature range of the measurements and experimenting with different coating materials .",
