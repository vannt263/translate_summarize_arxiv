    "in the model of citation proposed by price  @xcite , it is assumed that on average each paper published cites @xmath4 previous papers , which are chosen in proportion to the number  @xmath1 of citations they already have plus a positive constant  @xmath5 .",
    "the constant is necessary to ensure that papers with no previous citations  which is all papers upon first appearance  can still receive citations .",
    "price himself studied only the case @xmath6 , but the generalization to other cases is trivial .",
    "the model also includes the widely studied model of barabsi and albert  @xcite as a special case when @xmath7 .",
    "the model can be solved exactly for the citation distribution in the limit of a large number of papers using a master - equation method introduced by simon  @xcite .",
    "the solution shows that the fraction  @xmath0 of papers with exactly @xmath1 citations in the model network is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the euler beta function , @xmath10  is the standard gamma function , and @xmath11 for large values of its first argument , the beta function has the asymptotic form @xmath12 , and hence the tail of the citation distribution has a power - law form @xmath2 , just as in the empirical data .",
    "there is much more that can be done with the model , however , than just calculating total numbers of citations . in particular",
    ", one can calculate the full distribution of citations a paper should receive as a function of its date of publication .",
    "suppose @xmath13 papers in all have been published and let @xmath14 be the probability that the @xmath15 paper has exactly @xmath1 citations .",
    "then , as shown for the case @xmath16 by krapivsky and redner  @xcite and more generally by dorogovtsev and mendes  @xcite , @xmath14  satisfies the master equation @xmath17 .",
    "\\label{eq : agerate1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the only exception to this equation is for the case  @xmath18 , where instead we get @xmath19 notice the kronecker delta , which adds a single paper with @xmath18 if @xmath20 , but none otherwise .    in  @xcite these equations",
    "are solved using a continuous - time method in which the discrete difference equation is approximated by a differential equation . here",
    "we take a slightly different approach that leads to the same conclusions but avoids the approximation .",
    "let us define a `` time '' variable  @xmath21 such that the @xmath15 paper published has @xmath22 .",
    "( technically @xmath21 need have nothing to do with actual time ",
    "it measures only the sequence of publications  so the model can be used even if the rate of appearance of publications is not constant over time , a common situation . ) at the same time let us also change from @xmath14 to a density function @xmath23 such that @xmath24 is the expected fraction of papers that have been cited  @xmath1 times and fall in the interval from @xmath21 to @xmath25 . substituting for these quantities in eqs .   and  , taking the limit of large  @xmath13 , and introducing the shorthand notation @xmath26 for the limiting distribution  @xmath27 , we find that @xmath28 with the convention that @xmath29 for all  @xmath21 , @xmath3  defined as in  , and boundary conditions @xmath30 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that these equations have the solution @xmath31 which is equivalent to the solution given in  @xcite , and from this one can calculate the average number  @xmath32 of citations a paper receives as a function of its time of publication : @xmath33    the first thing to notice about this expression is that it becomes arbitrarily large as @xmath34 , meaning that , if the assumptions of the model are correct , papers published early on should expect to receive far more citations than those published later , even after allowing for the fact that later papers have less time to accrue citations .",
    "this is the first - mover advantage . in effect , as argued in  @xcite , the model predicts not only that there will be a long tail to the citation distribution , but that the tail will be composed principally of the earliest papers published .",
    "the common - sense reasoning behind this observation is that papers published early in a field receive citations essentially regardless of content because they are the only game in town .",
    "authors feel the need to cite _ something _ and if there is only a small number of relevant publications then inevitably those publications get cited .",
    "this gives the earliest publications a head start that is subsequently amplified by the preferential attachment process and they continue to receive citations indefinitely at a higher rate than later papers because they have more citations to begin with .",
    "there may be some truth to this .",
    "it is not uncommon to hear a scientist grumble about a paper that , in their opinion , receives citations only because `` everybody cites that paper . ''",
    "more to the point , citing a paper because it was the first in an area is in most cases entirely appropriate : the first researcher to bring an issue to the attention of the scientific community surely deserves credit for it , regardless of whether the other details of their paper turn out later to be important . on the other hand ,",
    "it is clear that the detailed contents of a paper usually do play a role in determining the attention it receives  @xcite and thus the preferential attachment model can not be a complete representation of the citation process . nonetheless , as we now show , it turns out in some cases to describe the statistical features of real citation networks with surprising accuracy .",
    "testing the preferential attachment model against citation data poses some challenges .",
    "it is clear , for a start , that the model can not be considered seriously as a representation of the _ entire _ citation network , the network of all papers ever published , since the literature is divided into many fields with most citations falling between papers in the same field . in the best of worlds , therefore , the model could only reasonably be considered to describe citations within a single field . moreover , given that a large part of our interest here focuses on the qualities of the earliest papers published , we need to find data that describe a field from its earliest foundation and such data can be hard to come by .",
    "figure  [ fig : networks ] shows one relatively clean example , a citation network of papers on network theory  the topic of this very paper . within the hard sciences this is a field of relatively recent provenance , attracting an impressive volume of research since the late 1990s but almost none before that .",
    "( its history in the social sciences is much longer , as price s work attests , but cross - citation between the areas is rare enough as to be negligible  a lucky feature for our analysis , although an unfortunate one for the progress of science . )    our citation network for this example consists of five early and well cited papers in the field  @xcite along with all papers that cite them , but excluding review articles , which tend to have distinctively different citation patterns , and restricted to papers in physics and related areas . the resulting data set contains 2407 papers in all spanning a ten - year period from june 1998 to june 2008 .",
    "figure  [ fig : networks]a shows the complete distribution of numbers of citations to these papers , along with the best fit to the form  ( [ eq : pricepk ] ) . as we can see , this two - parameter fit is remarkably good , and allows us to extract accurate values for @xmath5 and @xmath3 from the data . in fig .",
    "[ fig : networks]b , we show the average number of citations received by papers as a function of time , where time is measured , as in the model , in terms not of publication date but of publication order . we also show the predicted value of the same quantity from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) , and this is now , effectively , a zero - parameter fit , since the two parameters appearing in the formula have already been fixed .",
    "nonetheless , the agreement between data and theory is again good , and in particular the data show a clear first - mover effect of a magnitude and duration very similar to that predicted by the model .",
    "as we mentioned above , the effect is sizable : the first 10% of papers in this example received an average of 101 citations each , while the second 10%published only a little later  received just  26 .",
    "the most recent 10% of papers in the data set received a miserable 0.08 citations each , meaning that most of them have never been cited at all .",
    "we can take our analysis further . figure  [ fig : networks]c[fig : networks]e shows a detailed comparison of the actual distribution of citations at different times against the theoretical predictions . again",
    "the fit is quite good , although there are some interesting differences between data and model now visible . in particular , there are noticeably more papers published at early times in each degree range than predicted by the theory and correspondingly fewer around the peak value , meaning that not all papers in the early period are benefiting from the first - mover advantage ; we hope this is a positive sign that citation rates are reflecting on paper content at least to some extent .",
    "more interestingly perhaps , there are also a scattering of papers that are cited substantially more than expected .",
    "these are few enough in number that they have little visible effect on the figure , but the number of citations they receive puts them well outside the expected range .    and",
    "this leads us to an interesting possibility .",
    "it is common to assess the importance of papers according to the number of citations they receive , but the results presented here suggest that a large part of the variation in citation numbers is a result of publication date rather than paper content . if , however , we measure a paper s citation count relative to the average in its field _ for the given publication date _ , then this effect is factored out and  perhaps  the true stars of the citation galaxy will emerge . we have done this for our network theory data set , calculating a @xmath35-score for each paper that measures the number of standard deviations by which its citation count surpasses the appropriate mean  @xcite .",
    "the `` best - cited '' papers by this measure turn out to be roughly evenly distributed over the ten - year period covered by the data set , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : outliers ] , a sign that perhaps the technique is indeed factoring out effects of timing . some early seminal works such as ref .",
    "@xcite , which at 2623 citations is the most cited paper in the data set , score highly ( @xmath36 above the mean for its publication date ) , but so do some later papers such as ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath37 above the mean with 233 citations ) . and ref .",
    "@xcite beats out both of these at 7.2 standard deviations above the mean even though its relatively recent 2006 publication date means it has received only 63 citations so far . on the basis of these observations one might tentatively predict that this paper ( and others like it ) will turn out to be influential .",
    "-score , above the mean for papers published around the same date . for clarity ,",
    "only papers with @xmath35-score greater than  2 standard deviations ( dotted line ) are shown .",
    "bottom : cumulative distribution function for subsets of papers in the data set .",
    "the top curve represents the full data set , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : networks]a , while the other three represent the most recent 90% , 75% , and 50% of papers , respectively .",
    "points represent observed values and solid lines represent the theoretical prediction , eq .  .",
    "]    the appearance of well cited papers relatively late in the development of a field is an encouraging sign that true citation patterns do nt just mindlessly follow the preferential attachment rule . to quantify this phenomenon further , we consider the overall distribution of numbers of citations for papers in the latter part of our citation time series .",
    "suppose we are interested in papers published after some time  @xmath38 .",
    "their distribution within the preferential attachment model , which we ll denote  @xmath39 , can be calculated by integrating eq .",
    "thus : @xmath40 with the substitution @xmath41 , the integral can be performed and the complete result written in the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the regularized incomplete beta function and @xmath44 .",
    "note that @xmath45 is simply the distribution for the complete network given in eq .",
    ", so that the incomplete beta gives us the factor by which the distribution for the later papers differs from the complete distribution .        for large @xmath46 and",
    "fixed  @xmath47 , as here , @xmath48  has the asymptotic form @xmath49  @xcite and hence @xmath50 thus the citation distribution becomes exponentially truncated with a typical scale @xmath51 which for small values of @xmath38 is well approximated by @xmath52 .    put in simple terms , when we consider the citation distribution for just the later papers in a field and exclude the earlier ones , we tend to throw out the papers with the highest numbers of citations .",
    "thus one expects to find a distribution in which few papers are highly cited .",
    "when we look at the data , however , we find poor quantitative agreement with the formulas above in the tail of the distribution . the lower panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : outliers ] shows the appropriate plot for our network science example .",
    "as the figure shows , the tail of the distribution is diminished when we exclude the earliest papers in the data set , but by not as much as the theory predicts .",
    "overall the tail still appears relatively long .",
    "it no longer follows the power - law form , but neither is it well described by the predicted exponential .    within the preferential attachment model",
    "it is almost impossible for later papers in a network to get very many citations because there are only a fixed number of citations to go around and most of them are going to the earliest papers . in fig .",
    "[ fig : outliers ] , on the other hand , it is clear that a substantial number of later papers are receiving large numbers of citations , a hopeful sign that we as scientists do pay at least some attention to good papers that come along later .",
    "these analyses are for just one example field , which provides a particularly clear instance of the first - mover effect .",
    "the same methods can be applied to other fields , though the results are nt often as clean .",
    "there are a variety of issues that can complicate the analysis .",
    "some are straightforward data problems : it may be difficult to restrict the set of papers analyzed to those that truly fall in just one area , or to be sure that you have captured all the relevant papers , or both .",
    "it may even be unclear when a field started at all ( when did research on apple trees begin ? ) , or it may have started so long ago that modern concepts of citation do nt apply .    however , there are also some cases where differences between observation and theory reveal behaviors of real scientific interest .",
    "two examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : other ] .",
    "panel  ( a ) shows the curve of average citation number for the subfield of particle physics concerned with theories of `` strange matter ''  @xcite  a topic that has at the time of writing been receiving some attention with the start - up of the large hadron collider .",
    "as the figure shows , there is again good general agreement between observed citation counts and the model , and a strong first - mover advantage similar in size to that predicted by the theory , an interesting finding given that this data set spans an interval of 24 years  far longer than that of fig .",
    "[ fig : networks ] . however , there is now also an additional `` bump '' in citation intensity in the latter half of the time period , corresponding to papers published around 19992001 and denoted roughly by the dotted line in the figure .",
    "this bump , we assume , is a result of true scientific developments in the field , though we leave the experts in the area to suggest what developments those might be .",
    "more substantial deviations from the theory arise when a branch of the literature assumed to represent a new field turns out in fact to be merely a subset of a larger , already - established field . in this case",
    ", we would not expect to see a first - mover effect at all .",
    "the first papers published in such a branch will be cited at a level typical of their position in the middle of the larger subject area , and not as they would if they were the only game in town .",
    "we give an example of behavior of this type in fig .",
    "[ fig : other]b , which shows citations to papers about adult neural stem cells .",
    "the discovery that neural stem cells exist not only during development but in adult animals as well  @xcite has resulted in a healthy quantity of subsequent research , but it has not , at least according to our analysis , created a `` new field . '' as fig .",
    "[ fig : other]b shows , the fit between the observed citation record and the theory is poor in this case and in particular the data show no discernible first - mover effect .",
    "earlier papers in the data set do have more citations , but citation numbers appear to increase only linearly with paper age , suggesting that on average papers are being cited at roughly the same rate regardless of when they were published .",
    "a qualitative inspection of the data set indicates that in fact the adult neural stem cell literature forms just a part of a larger community of citation on neural stem cells in general and hence we indeed expect no first - mover effect in this case .",
    "analyses of the type described here could thus , in principle , provide an independent test of claims , frequent in some areas , that a particular publication or discovery has created a new field of science .",
    "we repeat our caution , however , that the data are not always as clean as we would like and it is not always possible to make a firm statement one way or the other .",
    "in conclusion , the strong first - mover advantage predicted by theories of the scientific citation process seems to be quantitatively substantiated by empirical citation data , at least in some areas .",
    "the cynical observer would , it appears , have some justification in concluding that if you want to be well cited you are better off writing the first paper in such an area than writing the best .",
    "other areas , by contrast , show no first - mover effect , which may be an indication that those areas do not constitute self - contained research fields as assumed by the theory . and even in cases where the first - mover effect is strong , a small number of later papers do seem buck the trend and attract significant attention in defiance of predictions .",
    "we tentatively suggest that the reader looking for true breakthroughs could do worse than keep an eye out for papers such as these .",
    "the author thanks carrie ferrario , loet leydesdorff , robert messing , aaron pierce , and sidney redner for useful suggestions .",
    "this work was funded in part by the national science foundation under grant dms0405348 and by the james  s. mcdonnell foundation .",
    "a related phenomenon , the `` matthew effect , '' was previously discussed by merton  @xcite , who observed that the simultaneous discovery of an important result by two different scientists is more likely to be credited to the more famous of the two , so that fame begets more fame ."
