    "optical phase measurement in a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) consists of three steps [ see e.g. , refs .",

    "first , a probe state @xmath0 is prepared and is injected into the mzi .",
    "second , it undergoes a dynamical process described by a unitary operator @xmath1 and evolves into a phase - dependent state @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a dimensionless phase shift .",
    "finally , a detection @xmath4 and a specific data processing are made at the output ports to obtain an interferometric signal @xmath5 $ ] , which shows an oscillatory pattern with the resolution determined by the full width at half maximum @xmath6 of the signal and the wavelength @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the phase sensitivity is determined by the error - propagation formula @xmath9 , with the square root of the variance @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "an optimal measurement scheme with a proper choice of data processing is important to improve the resolution and the sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in a coherent - light mzi , the intensity measurement at one of the two output ports produces the signal @xmath11 or @xmath12 , which exhibits the @xmath13 and hence the fringe resolution @xmath14 , known as the rayleigh resolution limit  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated that coherent light can provide a better resolution beyond the rayleigh limit ( i.e. , super - resolution ) ; however , the achievable sensitivity is much worse than the shot - noise limit @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is average number of photons .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have proposed that coincidence photon counting with a bayesian estimation strategy results in the shot - noise limited sensitivity over a broad phase interval .",
    "however , the visibility of the coincidence rates decays quickly with the increased number of photons being detected  @xcite .",
    "the parity measurement gives binary outcomes , dependent upon even or odd number of photons at one of two output ports .",
    "it originates from atomic spectroscopy with an ensemble of trapped ions  @xcite and was discussed in the context of optical interferometry by gerry  @xcite and subsequently by others  @xcite .",
    "recently , gao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed that the parity measurement can lead to the super - resolution in the coherent - light mzi . using a binary - outcome homodyne detection , distante _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have demonstrated a super - resolution with the @xmath17 and a phase sensitivity close to the shot - noise limit .",
    "most recently , cohen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have realized the parity measurement in a polarization version of the mzi .",
    "in contrast to the previous theory  @xcite , they found that the peak height of signal decreases as the average photon number @xmath16 increases , which in turn leads to divergent phase sensitivity at certain phase shifts .",
    "more surprisingly , they found that the zero - nonzero photon counting ( hereinafter , called the @xmath18 detection ) can saturate the shot - noise limit and gives a slightly better sensitivity than that of the parity measurement .",
    "since both the parity and the @xmath18 detections are simply two kinds of photon counting , the reason the @xmath18 detection prevails is still lacking .    in this paper , we present a unified description to the above coherent - light mzi experiments  @xcite , using general expressions of conditional probabilities for detecting an outcome in homodyne detection and in photon counting measurement . we first show that for a general binary - outcome measurement , the simplest data processing based on inverting the average signal can saturate the cramr - rao ( cr ) bound . for such measurements ,",
    "more complicated data processing techniques such as maximal likelihood estimation or bayesian estimation are not necessary .",
    "this conclusion is independent of the input states and the presence of noises .",
    "next , we investigate the role of phase diffusion  @xcite on the binary - outcome homodyne detection , the parity measurement , and the @xmath18 measurement .",
    "our analytical results show that the diffusion plays a role in a form of @xmath19 , rather than the phase - diffusion rate @xmath20 and the mean photon number @xmath16 alone . when @xmath21 , the effect of phase noise can be negligible ; both the resolution and the best sensitivity almost follow the shot - noise scaling @xmath22 . as @xmath19 increases ,",

    "second , the phase shift @xmath3 is accumulated in one arm of the interferometer  @xcite through an unitary evolution @xmath31 , with the number operator @xmath32 .",

    "finally , a measurement and data processing are performed to obtain phase - sensitive output signal , which determine the fringe resolution and the phase sensitivity .",

    "moreover , we verify that the cr bound of _ any _ binary - outcome measurements can be saturated by the simplest data processing based on inverting the average signal .    in quantum interferometry , any measurement of the hermitian operator @xmath4 with respect to arbitrary phase - encoded state @xmath74 can be modeled by projection onto the orthonormalized eigenstates @xmath75 of operator @xmath4 , with @xmath76 . here",
