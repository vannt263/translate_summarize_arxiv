    "the photon induced reactions on nucleons where mesons and baryons are measured as final decay products , have revealed a rich excitation spectrum of nucleons and other baryons that reflects their complicated multi - quark inner dynamics .",
    "the determination of the properties of the nucleon excited states ( or resonances ) from the data of such experiments is a major challenge of hadron physics @xcite .",
    "the effective methods that are used to describe the dynamics of meson production reactions , include explicitly the baryon resonance states whose properties are extracted by comparing the predictions of the theory with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "however , for a reliable realization of this task , a model is required that can analyze different reactions over the entire energy range using a single lagrangian density , which generates all non - resonance contributions from born , @xmath2- and @xmath3-channel contributions without introducing new parameters . at the same time",
    ", the lagrangian should also satisfy the symmetries of the fundamental theory ( i.e. qcd ) while retaining only mesons and baryons as effective degrees of freedom .",
    "the coupled - channels method within the @xmath4-matrix approximation is one model that respects these constraints while providing a way to analyze simultaneously all the reaction data for a multitude of observables in different reaction channels .",
    "it also leads to a convenient way of imposing the unitarity constraint because the @xmath5 matrix in this approach is unitary provided the @xmath4-matrix is taken to be real and hermitian ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the experimental data on the @xmath6 meson and associated strangeness ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) production in photon - nucleon reactions are available for photon energies ( @xmath9 ) in the range of threshold to 3  gev .",
    "thus they cover not only the entire resonance region but also the region where the background contributions ( @xmath3-channel amplitudes mainly ) are expected to be dominant .",
    "the data for the @xmath6 channel are reviewed recently in ref .",
    "the coupled - channels @xmath4-matrix method has been used extensively in refs .",
    "@xcite to describe the data of both these channels in the entire range of @xmath9 with a single set of parameters .",
    "these reaction channels have also been studied within the giessen coupled - channels @xmath4-matrix model in refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath9 between threshold to 2.0 gev .",

    ", we show the comparison of the scelm calculations with the data for the @xmath10 of the @xmath11 reaction as a function of @xmath12 beam momentum ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "it is clear that the data are reproduced reasonably well by the model within the statistical errors .",
    "the zero degree differential cross sections for the hypernuclear production reactions @xmath14c@xmath15be and @xmath16si@xmath17 mg calculated by using the same vertex parameters , are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "3 . in these calculations",
    "we have employed pure single - particle - single - hole @xmath18 configurations to describe the nuclear structure part .",
    "the bound proton - hole and @xmath19-particle state spinors were generated in a phenomenological model , where they are obtained by solving the dirac equation with scalar and vector fields having woods - saxon radial forms . with a set of radius and diffuseness parameters , the depths of these fields",
    "are searched to reproduce the binding energy ( be ) of the given state .",
    "the bes for the @xmath19 bound states were taken to be those predicted in the latest version of the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model @xcite as their experimental values are still unknown .. in this figure , we have shown results for populating the hypernuclear state with maximum spin of natural parity for each configuration . we see that the zero degree differential cross sections for the @xmath19 hypernuclear production reactions peak around the beam momentum of 1.0 gev / c with peak cross section of more than 1 @xmath20 .",
    "they closely follow the trends of the elementary @xmath19 production cross sections .",
    "our predictions will be useful for the future jparc experiments .",
    "the heavy flavored hadrons consisting of relatively heavier mass charm quarks provide an additional handle for the understanding of qcd .",
    "the charm quark introduces a mass scale that is much larger than the confinement scale @xmath22 mev .",
    "in contrast , the energy scale of the lighter quarks is @xmath23 .",
    "the presence of two scales in such systems naturally leads to the construction of an effective theory where one can actually calculate a big portion of the relevant physics using perturbation theory and renormalization - group techniques .    in this context , the investigations of the production of heavy flavor hadrons are of great interest . since the discovery of @xmath24 in 1974  @xcite , the production of charmonium ( @xmath25 ) states has been extensively studied in electron - positron and proton - antiproton ( @xmath21 ) annihilation experiments .",
    "yet a substantial part of the charmonium spectrum is still to be precisely measured .",
    "the first charmed baryon states were detected in 1975 in neutrino interactions  @xcite .",
    "although many new excited charmed baryon states have been discovered since then , the studies of the production and spectroscopy of the charmed baryons have not been carried out in the same detail as the charmonium states .    in the near future ,",
    "charmed hadron production will be investigated in the @xmath26 annihilation in the ( @xmath27 ) experiment at the fair in gsi , darmstadt @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using antiprotons in the study of the charmed baryon is that in @xmath26 collisions the production of no extra particle is needed for the charm conservation , which reduces the threshold energy .",
    "moreover , all the the charmonium states can be reached directly in this method , which is in contrast to the electron - positron annihilation where direct formation is allowed for only those final charmonium states that have the quantum numbers of the photon ( @xmath28 ) .    for the planning of these experiments at the @xmath27 facility , reliable theoretical estimates of the cross section of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 reactions are of crucial importance  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the scelm has been used to study the @xmath32 reaction as a sum of the @xmath3-channel @xmath33 and @xmath34 meson - exchange diagrams [ fig .",
    "a similar model is employed in ref .",
    "@xcite to calculate the cross sections of @xmath30 , and @xmath35 reactions as a sum of the @xmath3-channel @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and @xmath38 baryon - exchange diagrams , respectively [ figs .",
    "4(b ) and 4(c ) ] .",
    "also included in these calculations are the @xmath39-channel excitation , propagation and decay of the @xmath40 resonance into the @xmath41 and @xmath42 channels .",
    "it is found that the @xmath10 of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 reactions at the @xmath45 beam momentum of 15 @xmath46 ( which the regime of the @xmath27 experiment ) are around 25 @xmath47b and 550 @xmath48b , respectively .",
    "these values are drastically larger than those predicted in previous calculations based on models that invoke the quark degrees of freedom .",
    "the future @xmath27 experiment will clarify the adequacy of various models at these relatively lower beam momenta .    in * summary",
    "* , we can say that effective lagrangian models are able to describe reasonably well the intermediate energy nuclear reactions .",
    "the coupled - channels @xmath4-matrix method allows for the simultaneous calculation of the observables for a large multitude of reactions with considerably fewer parameters than would be necessary if each reaction channel were fitted separately . for the strangeness and charm production reactions , a single - channel effective lagrangian method with suitably chosen parameters",
    "is able to make important predictions that will be tested in the future experiments planned at upcoming facilities .",

    "<S> in the domain of nuclear reactions at intermediate energies , the qcd coupling constant @xmath0 is large enough ( @xmath1 0.3 - 0.5 ) to render the perturbative calculational techniques inapplicable . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> the quarks are confined into colorless hadrons and it is expected that effective field theories of hadron interactions via exchange of hadrons , provide useful tools to describe such reactions . in this contribution </S>",
    "<S> we discuss applications of one such theory , the effective lagrangian model , in describing the hadronic reactions at intermediate energies whose measurements are the focus of a vast international experimental program .    in the quest for understanding the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the hadron - hadron , hadron - photon and hadron - lepton reactions have played a major role . from these studies </S>",
    "<S> two quite distinct regimes of qcd have emerged . </S>",
    "<S> the first regime is of those processes that involve very high momentum transfers . here </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic freedom property of qcd has enabled the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) methods to describe  @xcite a large set of high energy large momentum transfer reaction observables with great precision , providing the most precise test of qcd to date @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the second regime that includes nuclear reactions at intermediate energies , is characterized by the confinement of quarks inside the hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> this remarkable feature , along with the running of the qcd coupling constant ( @xmath0 ) towards larger values makes the pqcd methods inapplicable - one requires techniques that can solve the theory exactly . to date , the only fully predictive non - perturbative method for studying qcd at low energies is lattice qcd ( lqcd ) . </S>",
    "<S> the progress in lqcd studies of the low - lying spectrum of qcd , hadronic structure and interactions has been significant in the recent years ( see , eg . , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , lqcd calculations are still far from being routinely amiable to solutions of intermediate energy nuclear reactions . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore , necessary to use effective methods to describe the dynamics of such processes . </S>",
    "<S> the effective field theories where hadrons interact via exchange of hadrons , provide a viable alternative to lqcd for the description of the intermediate energy nuclear reactions ( see , e.g. , refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> these theories implement the symmetries of the underlying theory , qcd , by using proper effective lagrangians . </S>",
    "<S> however , many of these models invariably require _ a priory _ knowledge of unknown parameters related to the coupling constants associated with the effective lagrangians and the masses of the hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> because the effective theories provide flexible theoretical approaches that allow a swift understanding of the intricacies involved in the scattering problems at intermediate energies and have the ability to guide to further experimental studies , steady progress has been made towards determining the realistic input parameters involved in these theories .    in this presentation </S>",
    "<S> we discuss applications of effective lagrangian based theoretical models , to describe the meson production reactions ( both non - strange and strange ) in photon and meson induced reactions on nucleons at intermediate energies . </S>",
    "<S> we also present some results on the charmed baryon and meson production in the antiproton - proton annihilation process . </S>"
