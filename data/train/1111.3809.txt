    "helioseismology has revealed a global pattern of differential rotation in the solar convective zone ( scz ) comprising three distinct , readily apparent , regions . in the bulk of the scz ( region 1 )",
    ", the isorotation contours appear mainly as quasi - radial spokes in meridional planes ( corresponding in three dimensions to cones ) .",
    "the contours change relatively little and only very gradually near the poles and equator , but in the boundary between the scz and the uniformly rotating radiative interior ( the `` tachocline '' ) , the isorotation contours are abruptly wrenched into quasi - spherical shells ( region 2 ) . finally , in the outermost few percent of the sun",
    "s exterior layers , the scz isorotation spokes gradually acquire lengthening tangential tails stretching from the parent spoke toward the equator ( region 3 ) .",
    "the challenge for the theorist is to account for this global organization as economically as possible , a task that motivates the current paper .    despite the intrinsic dynamical complexity of a rotating ,",
    "convecting fluid there are some indications that the solar rotation profile may obey rather simple mathematical laws .",
    "in particular , much of the convective zone may be governed by a reduced form of the vorticity equation , known as the thermal wind equation , or twe ( thompson et al .",
    "the twe involves a balance between inertial angular velocity gradients and baroclinic driving , the latter arising from angular entropy gradients that may be present .",
    "the twe is not , by itself , sufficient to solve for the rotation profile , since it is a single equation containing two unknowns , the angular velocity @xmath0 and entropy @xmath1 .",
    "it has been suggested , however , that @xmath1 and @xmath0 may be _ a priori _ functionally related , and that this relationship could be exploited to solve the twe .",
    "for example , balbus ( 2009 ) pointed out that a certain class of magnetized baroclinic modes were marginally stable if constant @xmath1 and @xmath0 surfaces coincided . with @xmath1 a function of @xmath0",
    "only , the twe can be formally , but quite usefully , solved .",
    "the solution does not yield the entire spatial structure of @xmath0 , rather it yields a parameterized form for the surfaces on which @xmath0 is a constant ( see equation [ 3 ] , below ) .",
    "the fit to the data is strikingly good .    in a subsequent analysis ,",
    "balbus et al . (",
    "2009 ; hereafter bblw ) argued that magnetic fields were not essential to establishing the @xmath2 functional relationship . under conditions expected in the scz",
    ", the effect of differential rotation on thermally convecting cells will be to distort surfaces of constant entropy into surfaces of constant angular velocity @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely , one expects the surfaces of constant _ residual _ entropy  the portion of the entropy in excess of the destabilizing radial entropy profile needed to drive convection  to tend to coincide with surfaces of constant angular velocity . in the twe ,",
    "a functional relation between residual entropy @xmath3 and @xmath0 works just as well as an @xmath2 functional relationship , since it is only the angular derivatives of @xmath1 that enter into the equation : the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath3 is a function only of radius @xmath4 .",
    "but the distinction between residual and total entropy is of course otherwise important . in numerical simulations of the scz that most closely resemble the sun , for example",
    ", surfaces of constant @xmath1 are nearly spherical shells , whereas surfaces of constant @xmath3 indeed correspond much more closely to those of constant angular velocity ( miesch , brun , & toomre 2006 ) .",
    "the mathematical implementation of the constraint of shared surfaces of constant residual entropy and rotation may be written [ one ] s(r , ) = f(^2 ) + s_r(r ) where @xmath5 is the entropy , @xmath4 and @xmath6 are the standard spherical radius and colatitude angle , @xmath0 is the angular velocity , @xmath7 is an arbitrary function of @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the spherical entropy profile needed to drive and maintain convection .",
    "equation ( [ one ] ) is then equivalent to the statement that the residual entropy @xmath10 is constant on a surface of constant @xmath8 .    on a strictly mathematical level , however , @xmath9 need not be a particular entropy profile  in equation ( [ one ] ) , it evidently could be any function of @xmath4 at all .",
    "within the theory of bblw , @xmath9 itself is never directly used in constructing the rotation profile . instead , it is @xmath11 that is important .",
    "the arbitrainess of @xmath9 endows equation ( [ one ] ) with a much greater generality than is obvious at first glance , a point that we will develop in  2 of this work .",
    "if the ansatz ( [ one ] ) is used in the governing dynamical equation ( the azimuthal component of the vorticity equation ) , a self - contained quasi - linear partial differential equation emerges for @xmath8 whose characteristics are precisely the isorotation curves of region 1 .",
    "these contours take the very simple mathematical form [ two ] r^2 ^ 2=a - b / r where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are constant along a given curve , where @xmath14 is the gravitational potential ( balbus & weiss 2010 ) . ] ; this basic structure is in excellent agreement with the helioseismology data ( bblw ) .",
    "if the isorotation curve passes through some colatitude angle @xmath15 at some radius @xmath16 , then the explicit equation for the isorotation curves is [ three ] ^2= ( r_0r)^2 . the dimensionless parameter @xmath17 is a number of order unity , which might be different for different contours .",
    "it may be possible to develop this formalism to explain the structure of the isorotation contours even beyond the bulk interior of the scz .",
    "recently , balbus & latter ( 2010 , hereafter bl ) argued that a tachocline structure resembling that of the sun emerges from the assumption of a simple @xmath18 spherical harmonic vorticity source that is present inside of some transition radius @xmath19 , and is otherwise @xmath4-independent .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath20 represents the radial derivative taken along a @xmath21 characteristic given by equation ( [ three ] ) , and if @xmath22 is a constant , then the equation [ four ] d^2 r = c p_2 ( ) reproduces the scz isorotation contours for @xmath23 , and is able to closely describe the tachocline isorotation contours for @xmath24 .",
    "the angular velocity remains continuous at the transition radius @xmath25 ; its derivative along the characteristic is discontinuous . in the bulk of the scz ,",
    "the twe characteristics and the isorotation contours are indistinguishable . within the tachocline",
    ", they are very different curves .",
    "this development is quite suggestive , hinting that an understanding of the sun s internal differential rotation may not require a detailed dynamical knowledge of convective turbulence . instead , the powerful constraint of thermal wind balance may be used to determine the angular velocity profile @xmath26 that is created by turbulent transport . at the same time , important questions arise which motivate the current work . in this paper , there is perhaps some progress toward elucidating some answers .",
    "but much remains to be done , particularly for the subsurface outer layers .",
    "_ why is the match between mathematical solution and observations so good in the bulk of the scz ?",
    "_ there seems to be a curious mismatch between the ability of the mathematical @xmath27 curves to reproduce the helioseismology data so strikingly , and the more qualitative physical arguments that motivate the precise form of the thermal wind equation that is used .",
    "the theory seems to work too well .",
    "we would not expect , for example , constant residual entropy and constant angular velocity surfaces to match _ exactly .",
    "_ we would expect there to be a _",
    "tendency _ to follow one another , and the most solar - like numerical simulations do show such a tendency ( miesch et al .",
    "2006 ) . but assuming an exact match leads to precise agreement between calculation and helioseismology observations .",
    "is there something more going on here ?    _ does thermal wind balance necessarily break down in the tachocline ?",
    "_ bl did , in fact , interpret their equation this way , but is this essential ?",
    "is it possible to retain thermal wind balance with a different functional relation between angular velocity and residual entropy that keeps the goodness of fit intact ?    _ what is the physical explanation for the angular structure of the tachocline isorotation contours ? _",
    "both the helioseismic morphology and the rotational dynamics seem to be completely dominated by quadrupolar - like forcing .",
    "for that matter , how accurately do we know that the angular behavior of the vorticity stress ?",
    "is it precisely quadrupolar ?    _ what is happening in the sun s outer layer ? _ do turbulent stresses become important ( miesch & hindman 2011 ) ?",
    "can we guess the form of a simple @xmath6-dependent forcing as was done for the tachocline ?",
    "the surface distortion of the isorotation contours does not display @xmath18 symmetry , it is strictly monotonic from pole to equator .",
    "the simplest possibility is @xmath28 forcing .",
    "how well does this work , and what is its physical origin ?",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows . in  2 , we review the results of earlier work ( bblw , bl ) in which it was shown that thermal wind balance and informal arguments were used to construct precise mathematical solutions for the isorotation contours in the bulk of the scz through the tachocline .",
    "we then show that the all - important relationship between the residual entropy and @xmath8 must be true in a well - defined and physically interesting asymptotic limit , independently of other dynamical complications .",
    "these `` complications , '' however , are likely to broaden the range of validity of the aymptotic limit . in  3 , we construct a global , thermal wind model for the sun s differential rotation profile , and show that it compares favorably with the helioseismology data .",
    "the outer layers are treated on an ad hoc basis , with a deeper investigation of the issues presented in an appendix .",
    "the change in the form of the isorotation contours apparent upon entering the tachocline does not indicate a breakdown of global thermal wind balance , but instead a local functional dependence of the residual entropy on both angular velocity and colatitude angle @xmath6 . in  4 , we present a physical discussion of our results , explore its limitations , and suggest directions for future research .",
    "throughout this paper , we will work with both spherical @xmath29 and cylindrical @xmath30 coordinates . as noted in the introduction ,",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath6 are respectively the spherical radius and colatitude angle .",
    "the quantity @xmath31 is the azimuthal angle , while @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the cylindrical radius and vertical cartesian coordinate respectively .",
    "the governing dynamical equation of our analysis is the @xmath31 component of the vorticity equation . for steady",
    "flows this is [ dix ] ( ) ( _ r)- ( ) = 1(r ) ^2 ( p ) or , since by mass conservation @xmath34 , [ onze ] = 1r ( p ) where @xmath35 is the velocity , @xmath36 the vorticity , @xmath37 the pressure , and @xmath38 is the density . equation ( [ onze ] ) implicitly defines a vorticity flux within the divergence operator on its left side .",
    "the vector @xmath39 is of unit norm , in the azimuthal direction .",
    "the left side of equation ( [ dix ] ) contains two terms , the first corresponding to advection by the poloidal velocity components of the vortensity ( divided by cylindrical radius ) , the second to vorticity distortion by differential rotation . for a purely azimuthal velocity field ,",
    "only the second ( vorticity - distorting ) term is present .",
    "the leads to what is commonly referred to as the _ thermal wind equation _ ( thompson et al . 2003 ) : [ trez ] -(^2r)_+ r ( ^2)_r - ( ^2z ) _ r = 1(r ) ( p )",
    ". an important simplification of equation ( [ trez ] ) is effected by replacing , with impunity , @xmath40 by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the adiabatic index .",
    "then , in terms of the entropy variable @xmath43 and gravitational field @xmath44 , we have : [ therm ] ( ^2r)_-r ( ^2)_r = gr^2 ( ) _ r on the right side , we have dropped the term proportional to @xmath45 in favor of @xmath46 .",
    "this is justified because , while the radial gradient of @xmath47 may well exceed its @xmath6 gradient in the scz ( region 1 ) , because of entropy mixing by convection it does so by a factor far smaller than the pressure radial gradient exceeds _ its _ @xmath6 gradient",
    ". we will adopt equation ( [ therm ] ) as our governing equation , though it must break down , of course , inside the radiative zone ( cf . ",
    "as discussed in the introduction and in bblw , the entropy variable @xmath47 appears in equation ( [ therm ] ) only in the form of its @xmath6 gradient .",
    "this means that any function differing from @xmath47 by another function depending only upon @xmath4 would serve just as well as @xmath47 itself .",
    "there is , in other words , a gauge invariance in the problem .",
    "this `` geostrophic degeneracy '' is lifted by fitting our @xmath0 solution to an explicit set of isrotation surfaces provided by observations . ] .",
    "this observation motivated bblw to introduce the residual entropy @xmath48 , defined by [ onebis ] (r , ) = ( r , ) - _ r(r ) where @xmath49 is the minimal adverse radial entropy profile needed to both drive and maintain ongoing convection .",
    "in this manner , we choose our gauge .",
    "the idea is that mixing of entropy would eliminate _ residual _ entropy gradients within a convective cell , but the resulting nearly constant value of @xmath48 within one convective cell need not be the same constant in another cell .",
    "bblw went on to argue that the presence of shear would favor the tendency for long - lived coherent convective structures to lie also within constant @xmath0 surfaces . under these conditions ,",
    "constant @xmath48 and constant @xmath0 surfaces would tend to coincide .",
    "the mathematical implementation of this is a powerful analytic constraint . if @xmath50 , where @xmath7 is a function to be determined , then [ constr1 ] ( r , ) = f(^2 ) + _ r(r ) ( cf .  equation [ [ one ] ] ) . in this view , the combination of convection and rotation in the scz constrains the two - dimensional entropy to be an _ additive _ function @xmath8 and @xmath4 .    let us take a somewhat more formal viewpoint for the moment . on purely mathematical grounds , for this development to be valid , all that is required is that the constraint embodied by equation ( [ constr1 ] ) be satisfied for whatever reason .",
    "if it is , the ensuing thermal wind partial differential equation becomes [ therm2 ] ( ^2r)_- ( ^2 ) _ r = 0 , where @xmath51 is @xmath52 , and we have made use of the @xmath53 notation of equation ( [ four ] ) .",
    "the solution to equation ( [ therm2 ] ) is that @xmath0 is constant along the contours given explicitly by equation ( [ three ] ) .",
    "it is remarkable that no knowledge of @xmath7 is necessary to extract the basic functional form of the contours : @xmath54 is just a linear function of @xmath55 .",
    "since these simple contours lie essentially on top of the helioseismology data ( bblw ) , the mathematical formalism at the very least constrains any deeper physical theory for the origin of @xmath26 .",
    "equation ( [ constr1 ] ) and thermal wind balance are empirically true .",
    "the ultimate underlying physical cause remains to be settled , however : the physical argument laid out in bblw may or may not be the correct one .",
    "in addition to a likely dynamical linkage between @xmath48 and @xmath0 , there is another simple feature of our problem that supports equation ( [ constr1 ] ) : the scz is rather thin .",
    "imagine a sun - like star with a slender outer convective zone . in the case of the scz itself , the central radius is about @xmath57 and our analysis extends @xmath58 , so the relative spread in the radial domain @xmath59 is some @xmath60 .",
    "the residual entropy @xmath48 is a two - dimensional function of @xmath4 and @xmath6 , but it could equally well be locally regarded , by the implicit function theorem , as a function of @xmath4 and @xmath8 ( the sign of @xmath0 should not matter ) should be well - behaved , free of internal extrema or saddle points over the domain of interest ; surfaces of constant @xmath0 should not be spherical .",
    "these are not concerns for our present application . ] .",
    "we shall assume this is valid throughout the scz .",
    "our motivation for choosing these two quantities as independent variables , as opposed to , e.g.  angular momentum and @xmath4 , is clear : we wish to turn the thermal wind equation into a simple mathematical constraint for the surfaces of constant @xmath0 . had @xmath8 not been one of our dependent variables , the task of extracting the form of the constant isorotation contours from the thermal wind equation would be much more difficult .",
    "much the same technique is familiar in thermodynamics , where the choice of functions for independent variables is somewhat arbitrary , but often dictated by what quantity is being held constant during the transformation of interest .",
    "if the dispersion in @xmath8 and @xmath4 in the scz is such that @xmath61 never leaves the bilinear regime , then equation ( [ constr1 ] ) will be directly satisfied , with gauge invariance allowing us to use either @xmath47 or @xmath48 .",
    "but an expansion in @xmath8 is not essential .",
    "if we expand @xmath61 in a taylor series about @xmath62 , there obtains [ twobis ] (^2 , r ) (^2 , r_c)+ ( 1-r_cr ) ( r ) _",
    "+ ... the second term , which we shall regard as a small , is reduced relative to the first by an explicit factor of @xmath63 .",
    "but , as we argued in the introduction , if in the dynamical regime of the scz there is already some tendency for constant @xmath48 and @xmath0 surfaces to coincide , which is another way of saying that _ any partial derivative of @xmath48 taken at constant @xmath0 will be small .",
    "_ the point is that `` small '' is by no means infinitesimal : the first - order correction to retaining the leading term in equation ( [ twobis ] ) is quadratic , not linear in small quantities .",
    "two @xmath64 effects would combine to yield a @xmath65 effect .",
    "it is the mutually reinforcement of the tendency of @xmath48 and @xmath0 surfaces to blend ( even if it is not more than a trend ) , plus the narrow shell approximation @xmath66 , that renders the @xmath67 ansatz more robust than might at first sight seem apparent .",
    "the narrowness of the shell means that residual entropy variations are more beholden to changes in @xmath0 than to the spread in @xmath4 , and the process of convection reinforces this trend by constraining the radial residual entropy gradients ( at constant @xmath0 ) .",
    "the sun happens to be in a felicitous theoretical regime from this point of view : it has both an order unity convective rossby number ( miesch & toomre 2009 ) and a relatively narrow convective layer .",
    "is it at all useful to consider the dependence @xmath68 ?",
    "this seems counterproductive in the scz , where @xmath0 already has a dominant @xmath6 dependence , and where we have just advanced arguments to the effect that @xmath48 should be considered a function of @xmath8 alone .",
    "but we can also turn this argument around . in the tachocline , @xmath0 is clearly dominated by its @xmath4 dependence .",
    "therefore , from a global viewpoint , adopting a @xmath69 dependence would allow both the tachocline and the scz to be treated on the same footing , without necessarily abandoning thermal wind balance . in this formalism",
    ", @xmath48 goes from a two - dimensional function in the tachocline @xmath70 to a simpler one - dimensional function in the scz @xmath71 .",
    "such a dynamical structure would not be unknown in the study of rotating fluids : a classical two - dimensional ekman boundary layer joining onto a one - dimensional interior taylor column exhibits the same feature . in ",
    "3 , this idea will be more fully developed .",
    "the current approach has helped us to understand the answer to the first question posed in the introduction : why do informal arguments work so well when our mathematical solutions are compared with observations ?",
    "it is enlightening to examine the mathematical form of our simple scz solution with a view toward the helioseismology data .",
    "let us start with the explicit solution ( [ three ] ) for an isorotation contour in the form ^2= ^2_0 + y^2 -y^3 where @xmath72 . then",
    ", expanding about some fiducial radius @xmath73 , ^2= ( ^2_0 + y_c^2 -y_c^3 ) + ( y - y_c ) ( 3y_c^4 -2 ^ 2_0 + 2y_c^3 ) + ... which implies the existence of a constant @xmath6 contour ( a radial spoke ) if y_c = 1.5 ^ 2_0 + lies within the convection zone .",
    "the data show that in fact it does so for @xmath74 . for other angles not too near the poles or equator ,",
    "the deviation from this class of contour is evidently not large .",
    "but neither is the alignment perfect : at larger @xmath15 the spoke is canted more parallel to the @xmath33 axis , while at smaller @xmath15 the ca nt is more orthogonal to the vertical direction .",
    "all this can be seen both in the helioseismology data , and the leading order term of a taylor expansion of our simple solution .      what is special about @xmath75 that much of the convection zone is to first order well - described by this class of contour ?",
    "it is by no means a direct consequence of our @xmath50 ansatz , yet it is the most striking feature of the scz , and must involve the dynamics of heat convection and rotation .",
    "we defer an extended discussion of this important point to a subsequent paper ( schaan & balbus 2011 ) , but the basic picture is easily grasped .",
    "the coupled dynamics of entropy and angular velocity gradients are indeed at the heart of matter .",
    "the most efficient route for heat transport is spherical convection , radial motions being the most direct path to the surface .",
    "however , an inevitable secondary consequence of turbulent convection in an initially uniformly rotating system is the production of differential rotation , a sort of dynamical pollutant in this case .",
    "the presence of differential rotation introduces its own inertial force , pushing fluid parcels away from spherically radial motions toward _ cylindically _ radial motions . for a displacement @xmath76 ,",
    "this acceleration is of the form @xmath77 .",
    "( note that this is _ not _ the coriolis force . )",
    "if spherical radial displacements dominate , this oblateness - inducing force is formally eliminated when @xmath78 .",
    "radially convecting elements could then not help but move in constant @xmath0 surfaces .",
    "this closes the circle of theoretical self - consistency : the gross pattern of differential rotation in the sun looks the way it does because in the presence of unavoidable build - up of differential rotation , @xmath75 would produce a pattern that would not interfere with the most efficient form of heat transport .",
    "the top priority of the convective zone would remain uncompromised .",
    "moreover , we have in the previous section noted that the description of the @xmath0 curves is _ not _ precisely @xmath79 ; the curves are canted slightly poleward everywhere but at the highest latitudes .",
    "this slight poleward ca nt emerges , in fact , from the linear theory of convective displacements ( schaan & balbus 2011 ) as well , and @xmath80 remains small .",
    "as one crosses from the scz into the tachocline , the isorotation contours change their character abruptly .",
    "it is possible that this is due to the increased importance of additional dynamics beyond pure rotational motion , and the thermal wind equation breaks down . on the other hand ,",
    "there is little reason to assume that the precise @xmath56 relation in the scz should hold here ; the @xmath4 component of @xmath81 becomes vastly more important in the tachocline .",
    "let us assume that thermal wind balance continues to hold in the tachocline .",
    "we will make use of the ansatz @xmath82 , which is particularly apt , since @xmath0 now carries a strong @xmath4-dependence .",
    "this pronounced dependence on radius is of course a consequence of the boundary condition enforcing uniform rotation at the radiative zone interface .",
    "once this zone is breached , the radial entropy gradient starts to rise , and the approximation of neglecting the term proportional to @xmath83 in the baroclinic contribution to the thermal wind equation eventually breaks down .",
    "but by this point , @xmath0 will be so close to uniform rotation that the shift of the isorotation contours is unlikely to be important .",
    "we turn now to an investigation of thermal wind balance in the tachocline .",
    "the thermal wind equation acquires a very different mathematical structure if @xmath48 is taken to be a function of @xmath8 and @xmath6 , as opposed to @xmath8 and @xmath4 .",
    "we will assume that this functional dependence is well - defined locally in @xmath4 for the tachocline region .",
    "the , the equation formally becomes [ twt ] ^2r - = gr^2 ( )_^2 . this should be contrasted with the case @xmath85 , for which the equation takes the form [ twt2 ] ^2r - = 0 .",
    "what is striking here is that equation ( [ twt ] ) has precisely the same mathematical form invoked by bl to account for the rotation pattern in the tachocline .",
    "( the computed rotation pattern fit the data well . ) but this earlier study viewed the right side of the equation as arising from _ external _ vorticity stresses . here",
    ", we see that this same equation could equally well arise without the need to appeal to external dynamics , emerging instead within the context of thermal wind balance .",
    "notice the important distinction between @xmath86 at constant @xmath6 versus constant @xmath4 . at constant @xmath6 ,",
    "the derivative is perfectly well behaved in the tachocline . at constant @xmath4 ,",
    "the derivative is ill - behaved : a significant change in @xmath48 can be accompanied by virtually no change in @xmath0 . for this reason ,",
    "equation ( [ twt ] ) is to be preferred .",
    "comparison of equations ( [ twt ] ) and ( [ twt2 ] ) reveals another simple but important fact . if @xmath48 is a function of @xmath8 alone in the scz ( and it certainly appears to be so ) , equation ( [ twt ] ) is valid globally .",
    "the partial @xmath6 derivative on the right vanishes in the scz , and comes alive within the tachocline . at the very least ,",
    "this is a useful organizational framework for understanding solar rotation .",
    "the truly daunting problem of mastering the underlying dynamics of the tachocline can be decoupled from the strictly mathematical problem of finding self - consistent solutions to equation ( [ twt ] ) . for the latter",
    ", we may appeal directly to the observations , and to very general and simple dynamical constraints . while not directly addressing the underlying physical structure of the tachocline ,",
    "this approach is not without interest : a compelling fit would be strong evidence for the assumption of thermal wind balance .      in bl ,",
    "the characteristics of the scz continued into the tachocline , and the entire inhomogeneous term on the right side of the governing equation was assumed to be proportional to a function of @xmath6 only , the spherical harmonic @xmath87 .    in the current theoretical formalism , we have created somewhat tighter mathematical constraints for ourselves .",
    "the scz characteristics can now extend into the tachocline ( which bl found produced good agreement with the data ) only if @xmath88 is a function of @xmath8 alone .",
    "this means that @xmath89 can be a function only of @xmath6 .",
    "this in turn means that the right side inhomogeneous term of equation ( [ twt ] ) has a steep @xmath90 radial dependence .",
    "this radial dependence was _ not _ present in bl , since the entire transition zone ( from @xmath91 to @xmath92 was viewed as a local boundary layer .",
    "how does the additional radial dependence , a new feature of the current model , affect the shape of the tachocline isorotation contours ?    in the tachocline , equation ( [ twt ] ) may be written [ uni ] d^2 r = gr^2 ( )_^2 .",
    "the @xmath6 dependence of the right side of the equation may be inferred from helioseismology data as being approximately proportional to @xmath93 , or @xmath94 .",
    "we will consider a slightly more general form , @xmath95 , allowing @xmath96 to be determined by the best fit .",
    "( note that the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath48 itself must then involve a superposition of @xmath97 and @xmath87 , as found in the simulations of miesch et al . [",
    "consider the equation [ unii ] d^2 r = cr^4(^2- ) .",
    "the formal solution to equation ( [ unii ] ) is that @xmath98 is given along a characteristic curve by [ vingt ] ^2(r ) = ^2(r_1 ) + ^r_r_1 cr^4 [ ^2(r ) - ] dr with [ twen ] ^2(r ) = ( r_0r)^2 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath99 and @xmath15 represent the starting and defining point of the characteristic ( the effective surface ) , and @xmath100 is a fiducial radius marking here the starting point of the tachocline .",
    "in general , we will use equation ( [ vingt ] ) with @xmath101 , reversing the integration limits and changing the sign .",
    "the @xmath17 parameter in general will depend upon @xmath15 , though it is simplest to take @xmath17 to be a global constant , and we will often do so .",
    "the radius @xmath99 will always lie outside of the tachocline on the constant-@xmath0 portion of the characteristic .",

    "a closer investigation shows that there is a better data fit . in figures ( 5 ) and",
    "( 6 ) we show overlay plots with @xmath130 and @xmath131 respectively . while these fits are reasonable , they are clearly inferior to @xmath132 . is there something special about this value of @xmath96 ?",
    "[ h ]    [ h ]    one possible explanation is dynamical .",
    "for example , what is the torque exerted by our solution on the inner , uniformly rotating radiative zone ?",
    "we assume that the couple is proportional to @xmath133 , the @xmath134 component of a viscous stress tensor . we denote _",
    "n = n+1n+2 so that @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 correspond to our three choices . then the following elementary integral identity is satisfied : _ 0^^n ( ^2-_n ) d= 0 .",
    "the case @xmath138 is relevant to the calculation of the torque exerted by the tachocline on the inner uniformly rotating core since this torque is directly proportional to the integral on the left side of the equation .",
    "( one factor of @xmath139 arises from the @xmath134 stress tensor component , another from the lever arm @xmath140 , and the third from the spherical area element . ) in other words , when @xmath141 , the torque exerted by the tachocline on the interior vanishes .",
    "since the couple to the core must act on time scales no shorter than evolutionary , we might therefore expect @xmath142 to yield the best fit .",
    "the best fit , however , is clearly @xmath143 .",
    "this is close enough to 0.8 that there may be something correct about our argument , but far enough off the mark that there is surely a piece of the puzzle missing .",
    "moreover , it really is the case that @xmath144 _ is _ the best fit in our models , not just among the three values we display here . while there is no compelling reason to believe that the value of @xmath96 may be accurately deduced from the idealized assumption of a vanishing viscous torque , it is puzzling that an equally simple , but quite distinguishable , integral constraint seems to fit the data so well .",
    "it is as though we had mistakenly included an additional factor of @xmath139 inside our viscous torque integral .    for the present , the explanation for why @xmath143 and not @xmath145 , corresponding to a true vanishing stress at colatitude @xmath146 rather than @xmath147 further south , remains elusive .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated global models of the angular rotation profile of the solar convective zone ( scz ) using the toroidal component of the vorticity equation and under the assumption of a dominant thermal wind balance .",
    "the model is global in that it seeks to unite both the tachocline and the bulk of the scz within the thermal wind formalism .",
    "the subsurface outer layers have also been treated at a quantitative , but more descriptive , level . in effect , we have modeled the subsurface outer layers by an ad hoc source term to the thermal wind equation .",
    "the general nature of the isorotation surfaces in the joint scz - tachocline structure seems to be a mathematical consequence of a few simple principles , each noncontroversial by itself : i ) thermal wind balance , as noted above ; ii ) a narrow scz which may be treated locally in @xmath4 ; iii ) a tendency for surfaces of constant angular velocity and residual entropy ( see below ) to blend ; iv ) an inner boundary condition of uniform rotation at the tachocline base ; v ) vigorous radial transport in the bulk of the scz ; vi ) a small couple between the tachocline and the core . when modeled by an idealized viscous prescription and the simplest possible deiviation from spherical symmetry , assumption vi gives close , but not perfect , agreement with helioseismology data .    as in earlier studies ( e.g. bblw , bl ) , we have introduced and exploited the concept of residual entropy , in essence the true entropy minus a suitable average over angles .",
    "the residual entropy is , in fact , defined only up to an additive function of @xmath4 .",
    "numerical simulations are particularly well suited to this concept : a schwarzschild - unstable , user - determined entropy profile @xmath148 is imposed to drive the requisite convective turbulence , and what one may call the `` response '' entropy @xmath149 is then the quantity that is calculated ( e.g. miesch & toomre 2009 and references therein ) . while @xmath150 may formally differ from the residual entropy @xmath3 by compensating the radial background @xmath148 , in practice it is not diffiult to extract a suitable @xmath3 from the numerical simulations .",
    "the heart of our approach is to regard the two - dimensional residual entropy as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath6 in the tachocline , but a function of @xmath8 and @xmath4 in the bulk of the scz . in ",
    "2.3 we have argued that the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath48 within the scz is ultimately unimportant .",
    "in fact , it seems possible to arrive at the appropriate form of the scz thermal wind equation for this latter case via multiple routes ; the advantages of theoretical models that lead to the coincidence of constant @xmath48 and @xmath0 surfaces have been discussed elsewhere ( balbus 2009 , bblw , schaan & balbus 2011 ) . in any case ,",
    "such behavior enjoys very clear numerical support ( miesch et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the explicit bulk - scz and tachocline solutions , equations ( [ twen ] ) and ( [ isor ] ) respectively , work reasonably well even in the constant @xmath17 limit , and strikingly well when @xmath17 is permitted to vary .",
    "only the details of the mathematical solutions , not their essential structure , are sensitive to the choice of free parameters . at this point",
    "there seems little doubt that thermal wind balance is , in fact , the overall organizing principle for the tachocline and interior scz .",
    "we are , however , far from a complete solution .",
    "the mathematical equations contain free parameters , which must be chosen to fit the helioseismology data .",
    "we lack an understanding of how they are determined from first principles .",
    "for example , the existence of a tachocline `` bifurcation point , '' where the isorotation contours diverge either toward the pole or equator , is clearly a consequence of the @xmath6-independent boundary condition imposed by the uniformly rotating core .",
    "the location of this bifurcation point depends upon our @xmath96 parameter , which reproduces the data well if @xmath151 , and much less well if @xmath96 changes even by a little . why @xmath96 should be close to , but distinct from ,",
    "the value of 0.8 ( corresponding to vanishing viscous torque on the core ) is not yet clear .",
    "finally , the outer layers are not well understood .",
    "once again , the mathematical description of the isorotation contours seems simpler than the underlying physics that gives rise to them . a good match to the helioseismology data",
    "is obtained from an approach that uses thermal wind balance plus a simple @xmath152 external source .",
    "we may thus end on a positive note .",
    "if the work presented here is correct in its essentials , then the beginnings of a deeper dynamical understanding of the rotation of the solar convective zone are at hand .",
    "it is gratifying that there is a certain mathematical inevitability of the gross features of the sun s internal rotation pattern following from thermal wind balance and a tight coupling between the rotation and the residual entropy isosurfaces .",
    "it is likewise encouraging that the more complex appearance of the isorotation contours in the tachocline and outer layers seems to emerge from relatively simple mathematics .",
    "in short , there is no reason to think that the dynamics of the solar rotation problem is intractable .",
    "the blend of numerical simulation and analysis promises to be a powerful combination for elucidating the rotation profile of the convective regions of the sun and of other types of stars .",

    "the introduction of nonuniform poloidal velocities @xmath154 and @xmath155 into the flow causes the @xmath31 component of the vorticity , @xmath156 , to come into existence . because of our assumption of axisymmetry ( @xmath157 ) there are no changes at all to the poloidal components of @xmath158",
