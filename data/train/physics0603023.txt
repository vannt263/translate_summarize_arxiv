    "simple mathematical models describing emergent phenomena in human populations  @xcite , such as voter models and market models , have a long history of study in the social sciences .",
    "it is only relatively recently , however , that physicists have noted the close conceptual and mathematical connections between these models and traditional models in statistical physics such as spin models . building on this observation ,",
    "there have been a number of important advances in the understanding of these models in the last decade or so , most notably in the study of social networks  @xcite .",
    "while the physics community has been concerned primarily with studies of network structure , there has also been a substantial line of investigation focusing on dynamical processes on networks .",
    "one example , which has a long history in sociology but is also well suited to study using physics methods , is the dynamics of opinion formation .",
    "this problem highlights one of the fundamental questions in network dynamics , namely whether dynamics controls the structure of a network or the structure controls the dynamics .",
    "it is observed that real social networks tend to divide into groups or communities of like - minded individuals .",
    "an obvious question to ask is whether individuals become like - minded because they are connected via the network  @xcite , or whether they form network connections because they are like - minded  @xcite .",
    "both situations have been studied with physics - style models , the first using opinion formation models  @xcite and the second using models of `` assortative mixing '' or `` homophily ''  @xcite .",
    "common sense , however , tells us that the distinction between the two scenarios is not clear - cut .",
    "rather , the real world self - organizes by a combination of the two , the network changing in response to opinion and opinion changing in response to the network . in this paper",
    "we study a simple model  perhaps _ the _ simplest  that combines opinion dynamics with assortative network formation , revealing an apparent phase transition between regimes in which one process or the other dominates the dynamics .",
    "consider a network of @xmath0 vertices , representing individuals , joined in pairs by @xmath1 edges , representing acquaintance between individuals .",
    "each individual is assumed to hold one of  @xmath2 possible opinions on some topic of interest .",
    "the opinion of individual  @xmath3 is denoted  @xmath4 . in the past",
    ", researchers have considered both cases where @xmath2 is a fixed small number , such as a choice between candidates in an election  @xcite , and cases in which the number of possible opinions is essentially unlimited  @xcite , so that @xmath2 can be arbitrarily large .",
    "an example of the latter might be religious belief ( or lack of it)the number of subtly different religious beliefs appears to be limited only by the number of people available to hold them .",
    "the case of fixed small  @xmath2 has relatively simple behavior compared to the case of arbitrarily large  @xmath2 , and so it is on the latter that we focus here .",
    "we will assume that the number of possible opinions scales in proportion to the number of individuals , and parameterize this proportionality by the ratio @xmath5 .",
    "( it is possible that not all opinions will end up existing in the population .",
    "our model allows for some opinions to become extinct as the dynamics evolves , so that the final number of distinct opinions may be less than  @xmath2 . )",
    "the @xmath1 edges of the network are initially placed uniformly at random between vertex pairs , and opinions are assigned to vertices uniformly at random .",
    "we then study by computer simulation a dynamics in which on each step of the simulation we either move an edge to lie between two individuals whose opinions agree , or we change the opinion of an individual to agree with one of their neighbors . to be specific ,",
    "on each step we do the following ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ill ] ) .    1 .",
    "[ step : rewire ] pick a vertex  @xmath3 at random .",
    "if the degree @xmath6 of that vertex is zero , do nothing .",
    "otherwise , with probability  @xmath7 , select at random one of the edges attached to @xmath3 and move the other end of that edge to a vertex chosen randomly from the set of all vertices having opinion  @xmath4 .",
    "[ step : vote ] otherwise ( i.e. ,  with probability @xmath8 ) pick a random neighbor  @xmath9 of @xmath3 and set @xmath4 equal to  @xmath10 .",
    "step  [ step : rewire ] represents the formation of new acquaintances between people of similar opinions .",
    "step  [ step : vote ] represents the influence of acquaintances on one another , opinions becoming similar as a result of acquaintance .",
    "note that both the total number of edges  @xmath1 in our network and the total number of possible opinions  @xmath2 are fixed . in the limit of large system size",
    ", the model thus has three parameters : the average degree @xmath11 , the mean number of people holding an opinion  @xmath5 , and the parameter  @xmath7 . in our studies",
    ", we primarily keep the first two of these parameters fixed and ask what happens as we vary the third .",
    "the expected qualitative behavior of the model is clear .",
    "since both of our update moves tend to decrease the number of nearest - neighbor vertex pairs with different opinions , we should ultimately reach a state in which the network is divided into a set of separate components , disconnected from one another , with all members of a component holding the same opinion .",
    "that is , the model segregates into a set of communities such that no individual has any acquaintances with whom they disagree .",
    "we call this the consensus state . furthermore ,",
    "once we reach consensus , all moves in the model involve the random rearrangement of edges within components , and hence , in the limit of long time , the components become random graphs with uniform uncorrelated arrangements of their edges .",
    "the primary interest in our model therefore is in the number and sizes of the communities that form and in the dynamics of the model as it comes to consensus .",
    "let us consider the distribution @xmath12 of the sizes  @xmath13 of the consensus communities . in the limit @xmath14",
    ", only updates that move edges are allowed and hence the consensus state is one in which the communities consist of the sets of initial holders of the individual opinions .",
    "since the initial assignment of opinions is random , the sizes of these sets follow the multinomial distribution , or the poisson distribution with mean  @xmath15 in the limit of large  @xmath0 .",
    "conversely , in the limit @xmath16 , only changes of opinion are allowed and not edge moves , which means that the communities correspond to the initial components in the graph , which are simply the components of a random graph .",
    "assuming we are in the regime @xmath17 in which a giant component exists in the random graph , we will then have one giant ( extensive ) community and an exponential distribution of small communities .",
    "thus , in varying  @xmath7 we go from a situation in which we have only small communities with constant average size  @xmath15 to one in which we have a giant community plus a set of small ones .",
    "this is the classic behavior seen in a system undergoing a continuous phase transition and it leads us to conjecture that our model displays a phase transition with decreasing @xmath7 at which a giant community of like - minded individuals forms .",
    "in other words , there is a transition between a regime in which the population holds a broad variety of views and one in which most people believe the same thing .",
    "we now offer a variety of further evidence to support this conjecture .",
    "( phase transition behavior is also seen in some models of opinion formation on static networks , such as the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , although the mechanisms at work appear to be different from those considered here . )    in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] we show plots of @xmath12 from simulations of our model for @xmath18 and @xmath19 . as the figure shows , we do indeed see a qualitative change from a regime with no giant community to one with a giant community . at an intermediate value of @xmath7 around @xmath20",
    "we find a distribution of community sizes that appears to follow a power law @xmath21 over a significant part of its range , another typical signature of criticality .",
    "the exponent  @xmath22 of the power law is measured to be @xmath23 , which is incompatible with the value @xmath24 of the corresponding exponent for the phase transition at which a giant component forms in a random graph ( a transition which belongs to the mean - field percolation universality class ) .    to further investigate our transition",
    ", we perform a finite size scaling analysis in the critical region . to do this , we need first to choose an order parameter for the model .",
    "the obvious choice is the size  @xmath25 of the largest community in the consensus state as a fraction of system size .",
    "the arguments above suggest that this quantity should be of size @xmath26 for values of @xmath7 above the phase transition ( and hence zero in the thermodynamic limit ) and @xmath27 below it .",
    "we assume a scaling relation of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the critical value of @xmath7 ( which is presumably a function of @xmath30 and  @xmath15 ) , @xmath31  is a universal scaling function ( bounded as its argument tends to @xmath32 ) , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are critical exponents . to estimate @xmath29 we plot @xmath35 against @xmath7 and tune @xmath33 such that the results for simulations at different  @xmath0 but fixed @xmath30 and @xmath15 cross at a single point , which is the critical point .",
    "such a plot for @xmath18 and @xmath19 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fss](a ) .",
    "with @xmath36 we obtain a unique crossing point at @xmath37 , which agrees well with the previous rough estimate of @xmath29 from fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] .",
    "using this value we can now determine the exponent @xmath34 by plotting @xmath38 against @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath40 is a universal function , we should , for the correct choice of  @xmath34 , find a data collapse in the critical region . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fss](b ) we show that such a data collapse does indeed occur for @xmath41 .",
    "we have performed similar finite size scaling analyses for a variety of other points @xmath42 in the parameter space and , as we would expect , we find that the position @xmath29 of the phase transition varies  see fig .",
    "[ fig : phd]but that good scaling collapses exist at all parameter values for values of the critical exponents consistent with the values @xmath43 and @xmath44 found above .    despite the qualitative similarities between the present phase transition and the percolation transition ,",
    "our exponent values for @xmath33 and @xmath34 show that the two transitions are in different universality classes : the corresponding exponents for random graph percolation are @xmath45 , which are incompatible with the values measured above .",
    "our model differs from percolation in another important respect also : percolation is a static , geometric phase transition , whereas the present model is fundamentally dynamic , the consensus arising as the limiting fixed point of a converging non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "it is interesting therefore to explore the way in which our model approaches consensus .    in previous studies of opinion formation models of this type on fixed networks a key quantity of interest is the average convergence time  @xmath46 , which is the number of updates per vertex needed to reach consensus . if @xmath47 then @xmath46 is known to scale as @xmath48 as system size becomes large  @xcite . in the opposite limit ( @xmath49 ) ,",
    "opinions are fixed and convergence to consensus involves moving edges one by one to fall between like - minded pairs of individuals .",
    "this is a standard sampling - with - replacement process in which the number @xmath50 of unsatisfied edges is expected to decay as @xmath51 for large times  @xmath52 .",
    "thus the time to reach a configuration in which @xmath53 is @xmath54 , and the convergence time is this quantity divided by the system size  @xmath0 . for fixed average degree @xmath11",
    ", this then implies that @xmath55 .",
    "this result is confirmed numerically in fig .",
    "[ fig : time](a ) .    for @xmath7 close to  @xmath29 , experience with other phase transitions leads us to expect critical fluctuations and critical slowing down in  @xmath46 .",
    "figure  [ fig : time](b ) shows that indeed there are large fluctuations in the convergence time in the critical region .",
    "the figure shows the value of the coefficient of variation  @xmath56 of the consensus time ( i.e. ,  the ratio of the standard deviation of @xmath46 to its mean ) as a function of @xmath7 and a clear peak is visible around @xmath57 . to characterize the critical slowing down",
    "we assume that @xmath46 takes the traditional scaling form @xmath58 at the critical point , where @xmath59 is a dynamical exponent  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : time](c ) shows a plot of @xmath60 as a function of  @xmath7 .",
    "if the system follows the expected scaling at @xmath29 then the resulting curves should cross at the critical point .",
    "although good numerical results are considerably harder to obtain in this case than for the community sizes presented earlier , we find that the curves cross at a single point if @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the latter being consistent with our previous value of @xmath63 for the position of the phase transition .",
    "to summarize , we have proposed a simple model for the simultaneous formation of opinions and social networks in a situation in which both adapt to the other .",
    "our model contrasts with earlier models of opinion formation in which social structure is regarded as static and opinions are an outcome of that pre - existing structure  @xcite .",
    "our model is a dynamic , non - equilibrium model that reaches a consensus state in finite time on a finite network .",
    "the structure of the consensus state displays clear signatures of a continuous phase transition as the balance between the two processes of opinion change and network rewiring is varied .",
    "we have demonstrated a finite size scaling data collapse in the critical region around this phase transition , characterized by universal critical exponents independent of model parameters .",
    "the approach to the consensus state displays critical fluctuations in the time to reach consensus and critical slowing down associated with an additional dynamical exponent .",
    "the phase transition in the model is of particular interest in that it provides an example of a simple process in which a fundamental change in the social structure of the community can be produced by only a small change in the parameters of the system .",
    "finally , we note that for the specific example of opinion formation mentioned in the introduction  that of choice of religion  it is known that the sizes of the communities of adherents of religious sects are in fact distributed , roughly speaking , according to a power law  @xcite .",
    "this may be a signature of critical behavior in opinion formation , as displayed by the model described here , although other explanations , such as the yule process  @xcite , are also possible .",
