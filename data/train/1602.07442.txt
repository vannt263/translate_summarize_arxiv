    "can be achieved through resonant excitation ( spin pumping  @xcite ) or nonresonantly by creation of a thermal nonequilibrium at the interface between the ferromagnet and the spin sink ( spin seebeck effect  @xcite ) . while the spin hall effect and spin pumping are reasonably well understood from a theoretical perspective , the detailed microscopic mechanism responsible for the spin seebeck effect is still vividly discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "experiments showed that the effect is nontrivially connected to the saturation  @xcite and sublattice magnetization  @xcite of the magnetically ordered material and that the effective temperature of the magnons , which are deemed responsible for the effect , is very close to that of the phonons  @xcite .",
    "moreover , numerical studies  @xcite and experiments  @xcite suggested that the emitted spin current itself plays a significant role for the magnon thermalization process at the interface .",
    "the thermalization between any two systems in the solid state usually occurs on very short timescales ( typically microseconds and smaller ) .",
    "therefore the aforementioned experiments are of somewhat limited value for the clarification of the dynamic properties of the effect as all of them were performed on time scales corresponding to the static regime . +",
    "two independent studies recently attempted to quantify the time scale for the magnon - phonon coupling relevant for the spin seebeck effect by means of modulated laser heating , allowing for the generation of thermal gradients on a submicrosecond scale .",

    "this is consistent with the notion that the energies of the magnons generating the measured spin seebeck voltage increase with decreasing the yig film thickness due to confinement  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of the measured spin seebeck voltage with the heating modulation frequency and the thickness of the yig layer provides further evidence that the magnon spectrum stimulating the spin current emission characteristically changes with the yig thickness .",

    "within the spin mixing interface conductance formalism  @xcite an energy imbalance between the two sides of a ferromagnet / normal metal interface  @xcite leads to the flow of angular momentum across the interface . for the spin seebeck effect",
    "this energy difference may be formulated in terms of a temperature difference between electrons in the normal metal and magnons in the ferromagnet .",
    "such a temperature difference may originate , e.g. , from diffusive  @xcite or stochastic  @xcite transport or by considering `` subthermal '' magnons  @xcite .",
    "while data at elevated temperatures are sparse , low - temperature measurements  @xcite and the relatively long lifetime of the small - wave - number @xmath33 magnons  @xcite even at room temperature suggest that the thermalization process between magnons and phonons is the limiting factor for high - frequency spin seebeck excitations .",
    "the interaction with the other thermal reservoir , the electrons in the normal metal , can be assumed instantaneous in the experimentally accessed frequency range as spin current emission has been demonstrated for much higher frequencies , e.g. , in spin pumping  @xcite or spin hall magnetoresistance  @xcite experiments .",
    "+ to explain the observed frequency dependence of the spin seebeck voltage we start from a steady - state model  @xcite .",
    "the energy supplied to the pt layer by the laser ( or microwave ) heating raises the temperature of the pt layer ( electrons and phonons are approximately in thermal equilibrium due to the fast electron - phonon scattering ) . energy and angular momentum are then transferred by the spin transfer torque from the electrons in the pt to the magnons in the yig , raising the magnon temperature @xmath34 . due to magnon - phonon scattering the energy is finally transferred to the phonon system and the heat sink . in the stationary situation",
    "a steady - state spin current is generated across the yig / pt interface which is proportional to the temperature difference @xmath35 of the electrons in pt and the magnons in yig .",
    "it is obvious that a finite @xmath36 and , hence , a finite spin seebeck voltage is obtained only if the magnons couple to the phonons .",
    "otherwise , @xmath37 .",
    "this is important for the nonstationary case .",
    "a finite @xmath36 is obtained only on time scales longer than the characteristic magnon - phonon interaction time @xmath38 in yig . on shorter time scales ,",
    "the energy can not be transferred from the magnon to the phonon systems , resulting in @xmath37 . in a simple relaxation time approach",
    ", the time evolution of the temperature difference @xmath39 between the magnons and phonons in yig can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath40 this is trivially solved by @xmath41 , which transforms to @xmath42 in the frequency domain .",
    "the transfer function derived from this model indeed describes the data of the @xmath43 and @xmath17 films reasonably well . following this reasoning the cutoff frequency in the @xmath1 film thus corresponds to a characteristic interaction time between magnons and phonons of @xmath44 .",
    "this is consistent with estimates in the literature  @xcite which put @xmath38 at a few hundred picoseconds for high - energy magnons .",
    "we note that in the simple relaxation time approach with a single , frequency independent relaxation time the extracted @xmath38 likely is a weighted average over the entire magnon spectrum contributing to the emission of the measured spin current . keeping in mind that @xmath38 rather is frequency dependent further",
    "explains why the transfer function for the thicker films deviates significantly from eq .  .",
    "in thermal equilibrium and in the absence of any spatial variation of the temperature , the magnon population is distributed according to bose - einstein statistics and can be described with a single magnon temperature @xmath34 .",
    "a thermal gradient , however , is accompanied by a flow of magnons along the same direction , with the diffusion length of individual magnons decreasing with their energy  @xcite .",
    "the different diffusion lengths become important at the edges ( interfaces ) of the magnetic layer at which only magnons closer than their respective diffusion length can accumulate . increasing the magnetic layer thickness then favors lower energetic magnons with their longer diffusion lengths in the interface accumulation .",
    "this also implies that increasing the thickness of the ferromagnet leads to a growing deviation from bose - einstein statistics right at the interface and the concept of a single temperature is no longer well defined  @xcite .",
    "according to numerical simulations  @xcite this effect is small for our thinnest films but should be more significant in thicker ones . at any rate ,",
    "the magnon spectrum is expected to show an exponential relaxation , similarly to eq .  .",
    "the lowest energetic magnons ( i.e. those with frequencies close to the ferromagnetic resonance frequency ) feature interaction times with phonons exceeding a microsecond and one would indeed expect the effective cutoff frequency to shift to lower values in thicker yig films . more specifically ,",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite derived the functional dependence of the @xmath4 rolloff frequency @xmath26 for a given magnon mode @xmath45 on @xmath46 as @xmath47 , \\label{eq : etesami}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the magnetization damping , @xmath49 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath50 is the external magnetic field , @xmath51 is the exchange constant , and @xmath52 is the saturation magnetization .",
    "the full transfer function is then a linear combination of the low - pass behavior of the individual magnon modes . as @xmath46 increases ,",
    "the mode number @xmath53 for magnons still effective at a given energy increases and more lower energetic modes become available . since these lower energetic modes feature smaller @xmath54 values [ cf .",
    "] the total @xmath26 shifts downwards , at a rate determined by the mode occupation number , i.e. the composition of the magnon spectrum .",
    "the @xmath32 behavior observed in fig .  [",
    "fig : fvsd ] is qualitatively consistent with an increased weight of the lower energetic end of the magnon spectrum in thicker films . in any case , the @xmath26 values plotted in fig .  [ fig : fvsd ] may be understood as approximate values of the dominant magnon mode , which we emphasize becomes increasingly crude when many modes with different @xmath55 values contribute similarly to the total signal in thicker yig films . with this caveat in mind @xmath26 in fig .  [",
    "fig : fvsd ] is related to the characteristic magnon energy stimulating the spin current emission via @xmath56 considering the different damping characteristics of the films grown by pulsed laser deposition ( @xmath57  @xcite ) and liquid phase epitaxy ( @xmath58  @xcite ) , we obtain characteristic energies of the order of @xmath59 in the thinnest films . for the @xmath1 yig film specifically eq .",
    "suggests the @xmath60 mode as the dominant magnon mode ( @xmath61 for the lpe grown @xmath17 yig film ) . converting the characteristic energy of this particular sample into",
    "an _ effective _ temperature we obtain @xmath62 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the results by boona and heremans  @xcite and jin _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite who give an upper temperature limit for the magnons contributing to the spin current of @xmath63 .",
    "we note , however , that in the context of measurements at room temperature it is highly ambiguous to refer to a subset of the magnon spectrum by means of its `` temperature '' , rather than its energy . from a different perspective , although themed `` low - energy magnons '' here , the characteristic frequencies of the magnons ( up to a few terahertz ) are substantially larger than those typically investigated in ferromagnetic resonance experiments ( a few gigahertz ) .",
    "still , the characteristic energies of the order of a @xmath64 at best render them rather low in energy compared to the energy scale suggested by the room - temperature measurements .",
    "+ finally , it is important to note that some caution is required regarding the specificity of the parameters derived from our experiments .",
    "it is clear that there is some leeway in the interpretation of the raw experimental data and that the different sample fabrication methods and related variations in , e.g. , magnetic damping in the films affect the accuracy of the derived numerical values .",
    "additionally the possible influence of a thermal skin effect  @xcite is not explicitly accounted for in the above analysis .",
    "while a skin effect will influence the magnitude and phase of the temperature modulation depending on the distance to the interface , it leaves the modulation frequency unaffected .",
    "simultaneously the magnitude of the attenuation at each point should be agnostic to the yig film thickness and thus fundamentally the same for all samples . in yig films",
    "thinner than the magnon mean free path  @xcite , however , some of the observed attenuation could be a residue of the above phenomenon .",
    "nevertheless , the extracted values appear to be consistent with the literature and are further supported by the @xmath65 value of some @xmath66 inferred from numerical simulations in ref .",
    "in summary , we investigated the frequency dependence of the spin seebeck effect and identified characteristic response times which depend on the thickness of the yig layer . specifically we find that the characteristic response time scales approximately as the inverse thickness of the films .",
    "this is consistent with recent experimental and theoretical studies and supports the notion that high - frequency magnons dominate the effect in thin films but are less important for its absolute magnitude and frequency dependence in thicker ones .",
    "our results allow us to develop a consistent picture of the physics behind the spin seebeck effect , providing a link between several recent experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite results .",
    "they could further be relevant for the numerical evaluation of the spin seebeck effect  @xcite and related  @xcite phenomena .",
    "going beyond the scope of the experiments presented here , further insights might be gained by systematically studying the effect of large magnetic fields and low temperatures on the dynamics .",
    "large magnetic fields have already been demonstrated to affect the dc properties  @xcite , an effect which should also translate to the transient response .",
    "the approach presented here could also provide further insight into the spectral composition of the thermally induced spin currents in compensated garnets  @xcite with nontrivial contributions from different magnetic sublattices .",
