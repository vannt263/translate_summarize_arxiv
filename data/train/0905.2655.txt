    "a tpc is a natural candidate for the ilc central tracker because of its very good performance in the past collider experiments  @xcite . at the ilc , however , we need the highest possible tracking efficiency in a jetty environment and a momentum resolution one order - of - magnitude better than those in the past .",
    "this requires very high 3-dimensional granularity ( a small voxel size ) and a space point resolution in the @xmath4 plane better than 100 @xmath5 m throughout the sensitive volume . in order to realize a tpc with such unprecedented performance , intense r&d programs are now on going in an international framework called the lc - tpc collaboration .",

    "the induction gap of the triple gem stack was increased later from 1 mm to 1.5 mm for the cosmic ray tests using a t2k gas , in order to increase the charge spread after gas amplification , while the transfer gaps ( 1.5 mm ) were maintained . a picture of the prototype is shown in fig .",

    "the grid wire plane consisted of 127 @xmath5 m thick wires strung 1 mm above the sense - wire plane with 2 mm spacing .",
    "it should be noted that the sense - wire pitch and the wires - to - pads distance were kept small as compared to those in conventional tpcs in order to obtain the best spatial resolution and the highest two - track resolving power achievable with a practical mwpc readout ) was about 1.3 mm . ] .",
    "the pad pitch was increased to 2.3 mm , from 1.27 mm in the case of the gem readout , corresponding to the increase in the width of the pad response function while the pad - row pitch ( 6.3 mm ) was retained .",
    "the mwpc - tpc was operated inside a 5-t solenoid at desy and the gem - tpc data was taken inside a 1-t solenoid at the kek cryogenic center . a pair of long scintillation counters was used for cosmic ray triggers .",
    "the readout electronics system for the aleph tpc  @xcite was used for the chamber signal processing and the traditional multifit ( doublefit ) program  @xcite was used for the data analysis of the cosmic ray events .",
    "the hit coordinate along a pad row was determined by a simple charge centroid ( barycenter ) method using the pad signals within a charge cluster in the row . among the tracks recorded in the tpc , those which were nearly perpendicular to the pad rows ( sense wires ) and parallel to the readout plane were selected for later analysis .",
    "the spatial resolution as a function of the drift distance ( @xmath8 ) obtained under a magnetic field ( @xmath2 ) of 4 t is shown in fig .",

    "the simulation took into account the primary ionization statistics of incident tracks , the diffusion of drift electrons , the lateral displacement of the drift electrons ( charge spread ) near the wire planes due to the @xmath12 effect , and finally the avalanche fluctuation in gas amplification .     spatial resolution measured with the mwpc readout in a magnetic field of 4 t.",

    "[ fig5 ] shows the simulated spatial resolution of the ilc - tpc equipped with the mwpc readout for @xmath2 = 0 , 1 and 4 t. the resolution for @xmath2 = 4 t is dominated by the @xmath12 effect throughout the drift region in spite of its decrease at long drift distances where the contribution of the electron diffusion increases .",
    "the situation is worse for t2k gas because of the larger charge spread near the wire planes caused by the @xmath12 effect and the smaller declustering effect due to its small diffusion constant ( @xmath10 @xmath7 30 @xmath5m/@xmath11 at @xmath9 = 250 v / cm and @xmath2 = 4 t ) .",

    "the solid curves in the figure are the results of analytic calculation  @xcite .",
    "the resolution deterioration at short drift distances prominent for the t2k gas at 1 t is not caused by an @xmath12 effect but by the finite pitch of the readout pads ( 1.27 mm ) , which is not small enough compared to the charge spread after gas amplification in the gem stack ( @xmath7 270 @xmath5 m )  @xcite .     spatial resolution as a function of the drift distance obtained with a t2k gas ( @xmath9 = 250 v / cm ) for @xmath2 = 0 and 1 t. the resolutions obtained in the beam test with a p5 gas ( @xmath9 = 100 v / cm ) are also shown for comparison . ]    the spatial resolution ( @xmath15 ) at long drift distances is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the intrinsic resolution and @xmath18 is the effective number of electrons , which is determined by the primary ionization statistics and the avalanche fluctuation for a single drift electron  @xcite .    since the diffusion constant",
    "is determined from the @xmath8-dependence of the pad response width  @xcite@xcite ( or given by magboltz ) one can evaluate @xmath18 from the @xmath8-dependence of the spatial resolution at long drift distances .",
    "the value of @xmath18 thus obtained was about 21 , which is in good agreement with a simple estimate of 22.2  @xcite , indicating that possible dissociative attachment of drift electrons by cf@xmath3 molecules  @xcite@xcite@xcite at the entrance to the gem stack is not significant if any .",
    "we also measured the diffusion constant and the drift velocity in a t2k gas as functions of the drift field , covering from the diffusion minimum ( @xmath9 = 100 v / cm ) to the drift velocity near - maximum ( @xmath9 = 250 v / cm ) .",
