    "the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite is a quantum field theory of fermions in which the only interaction is an attractive contact interaction between fermion and anti - fermion .",
    "its lagrangian density is @xmath2 , \\label{eq : njl}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 are pauli spin matrices with indices @xmath4 running over an su(2 ) internal symmetry , and @xmath5 runs over @xmath1 distinct fermion flavors . for bare mass @xmath6",
    "there is an @xmath0 chiral symmetry @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are independent global su(2 ) rotations .",
    "the original motivation for studying the model ( [ eq : njl ] ) is that for coupling @xmath10 larger than some critical @xmath11 it gives a qualitatively good description of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in strong interaction physics , with order parameter @xmath12 . at the large coupling strengths required for chiral symmetry breaking ,",
    "the fermions interact by exchange of composite scalars and pseudoscalars . in the chiral limit the pseudoscalars are goldstone modes , and",
    "are associated with physical pions .",
    "more recently , njl models have been proposed as a description of the higgs sector of the standard model @xcite , in which the higgs scalar appears as a fermion  anti - fermion bound state , and the goldstone modes are absorbed into longitudinal gauge boson degrees of freedom .    in weak coupling perturbation theory ( wcpt ) , the njl model is non - renormalisable for @xmath13 , being plagued by quadratic divergences in four dimensions .",
    "however , a perturbative expansion made about the critical point @xmath14 in powers of @xmath15 is known to be renormalisable for @xmath16 @xcite@xcite , and in @xmath17 suffers from only logarithmic divergences , implying that a moderate separation between uv and ir scales can be made . because the uv scale can never be completely eliminated from the theory by renormalisation without rendering the interaction strength vanishing ,",
    "the model is _ trivial _ for @xmath17 ; it shares this property with the model more conventionally used to describe the higgs sector , namely the o(4 ) linear sigma model , which contains elementary scalar fields .",
    "both models are believed trivial , and hence provide effective field theories only for scales @xmath18 , the uv scale . at scales",
    "@xmath19 , logarithmic scaling violations will manifest themselves , which in turn necessitate the introduction of higher dimensional operators corresponding to new physical information . taking these new operators into account , then in the sense that the number of undetermined parameters is the same for both njl and sigma models , the two models have equal predictive power for the standard model @xcite .    if we formulate definite lattice ( ie .",
    "bare ) actions based on these models , however , an approach perhaps more familiar in condensed matter physics , then triviality may manifest itself in distinct ways . for both models",
    "the upper critical dimension is four , ie .",
    "the symmetry breaking transition is described by mean - field ( landau - ginzburg ) critical exponents with logarithmic corrections . in the sigma model",
    ", deviations from mean field behaviour are well - described by wcpt , since the renormalised coupling is bounded by the fixed point value @xmath20 and is small as @xmath21 . using the renormalisation group @xcite@xcite , the following prediction for the equation of state , relating the order parameter @xmath22 to the reduced coupling @xmath23 and the symmetry - breaking field @xmath24 ( we retain the notation of the njl model )",
    "is derived : @xmath25 note that @xmath22 is measured in units of the cutoff , so that the argument of the logarithms diverges in the continuum limit . by contrast",
    ", symmetry breaking in the njl model occurs for large coupling strength , and wcpt is inapplicable .",
    "an alternative expansion parameter , @xmath15 , can be used @xcite ; at leading order this yields a qualitatively different form for the equation of state @xcite @xmath26 the different behaviour can be traced to the fact that in the sigma model the scalar excitations are elementary , and the associated wavefunction renormalisation constant @xmath27 perturbatively close to one , whereas in the njl model the scalars are composite , so that @xmath27 vanishes in the continuum limit for @xmath28 where the model is renormalisable , and @xmath29 for @xmath17 @xcite@xcite ; hence we expect ( [ eq : eosnjl ] ) to hold beyond leading order in @xmath15 .    the form ( [ eq : eossigma ] ) in the sigma and related scalar models has been subject to extensive analysis via monte carlo simulation ( two recent examples are refs.@xcite@xcite ) , which appear to provide support , although logarithmic corrections are notoriously hard to isolate numerically . for the fermionic case ,",
    "a simulation of the @xmath17 gross - neveu model , with discrete chiral symmetry , has shown support for the form ( [ eq : eosnjl ] ) @xcite .",
    "the issue of which is the appropriate equation of state is important for several reasons ; for instance , it informs the study of the inherently non - perturbative chiral symmetry breaking transition in lattice @xmath30 . some studies @xcite@xcite have assumed a scenario of triviality for this model based on a form similar to ( [ eq : eossigma ] ) , which may not be appropriate .",
    "another possibility is that different lattice implementations of the chirally symmetric four - fermi interaction , namely the `` dual site '' formulation @xcite used in @xcite and in this study , and the `` link '' formulation used in a monte carlo study of the u(1 ) njl model in @xcite , may lie in different universality classes with distinct patterns of logarithmic scaling violations .",
    "studies of the corresponding lattice models in three spacetime dimensions ( `` dual site '' in @xcite and `` link '' in @xcite ) , in which the two implementations yield radically different behaviour , support this scenario .    in this paper",
    "we extend the work of @xcite with a numerical simulation of the @xmath0 njl model , for a small number of flavors @xmath31 .",
    "the main motivation for this choice of four - fermi model , apart from the phenomenological reasons cited above , is that it has a maximal number of goldstone excitations , all of which contribute to the @xmath32 quantum corrections to the equation of state .",
    "we hope to discriminate between the two forms ( [ eq : eossigma ] ) and ( [ eq : eosnjl ] ) , and in particular to see if ( [ eq : eosnjl ] ) persists beyond leading order in @xmath15 . in sec .",
    "ii we outline the lattice formulation of ( [ eq : njl ] ) using staggered fermions , and discuss its interpretation in terms of continuum four - component spinors .",
    "it turns out that in our simulation each lattice species describes eight continuum flavors , and hence the @xmath31 model requires @xmath33 lattice flavors .",
    "this necessitates the use of a hybrid molecular dynamics algorithm @xcite@xcite .",
    "extensive studies on small systems reveal the systematic error in the algorithm to be @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the timestep used in the evolution of the hybrid equations of motion ; hence the systematic error can be kept under control . of course",
    ", we are still left with an unquantified error due to the use of a fractional @xmath36 , which implies a non - local action , but have no reason to suspect there is a problem .    in sec .",
    "iii we confront data taken on a @xmath37 lattice with a range of bare mass values in the critical region @xmath38 , with five prototype equations of state reflecting various theoretical prejudices , including the simplest mean field ansatz , and a non - trivial continuum limit described by non - mean field critical indices , as well as ( [ eq : eossigma ] ) and ( [ eq : eosnjl ] ) .",
    "no form satisfactorily fits all the data ; this is because there is a finite scaling window where the correlation length is sufficiently large for a continuum description to apply .",
    "we show that the most successful equation of state ansatz , in the sense of small @xmath39 , depends on which assumptions are made about the extent of the scaling window : if we include all mass values from a narrow region about the critical coupling then forms similar to ( [ eq : eossigma ] ) are the most successful , whereas if only small mass values from a wide range of couplings are used , then ( [ eq : eosnjl ] ) is the most appropriate form .    in sec .",
    "iv we examine data taken at vanishing bare mass , which is possible in four - fermi models formulated via the dual - site approach . due to the masslessness of the pion in this limit",
    "the data is subject to a significant finite volume effect , which we attempt to account for using a formula first derived for the sigma model @xcite .",
    "we find that the variation of the finite volume correction with @xmath10 can best be explained by assuming an equation of state ( [ eq : eosnjl ] ) , together with a wavefunction renormalisation constant @xmath40 : in other words , it is the finite volume corrections that seem most sensitive to the composite nature of the scalar excitations .",
    "the distinct triviality scenarios in njl and sigma models @xcite@xcite are rephrased in terms of the pion decay constant @xmath41 . in sec .",
    "v we present brief conclusions and directions for further work .",
    "the lattice action we have chosen to study is written @xmath42 where @xmath43 are bosonic pseudofermion fields defined in the fundamental representation of su(2 ) on lattice sites @xmath44 , the scalar field @xmath45 and pseudoscalar triplet @xmath46 are defined on the dual lattice sites @xmath47 , and the index @xmath5 runs over @xmath36 species of pseudofermion ; the relation between @xmath36 and the number of continuum flavors @xmath1 will be made clear presently .",
    "the fermion kinetic matrix @xmath48 is the usual one for gross - neveu models with staggered lattice fermions @xcite@xcite , amended to incorporate an @xmath0 chiral symmetry : @xmath49+m\\delta_{xy}\\right)\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta } \\delta_{pq } + { 1\\over16}\\delta_{xy}\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\sum_{\\langle\\tilde x , x\\rangle } \\biggl(\\sigma(\\tilde x)+i\\varepsilon(x)\\vec\\pi(\\tilde x).\\vec\\tau_{pq}\\biggr),\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the bare fermion mass , the su(2 ) indices @xmath4 are shown explicitly , @xmath50 , and the symbol @xmath51 denotes the set of 16 dual sites @xmath47 adjacent to the direct lattice site @xmath44 .",
    "the 3 pauli matrices @xmath52 are normalised such that @xmath53 .",
    "integration over the pseudofermions yields the following path integral : @xmath54 in terms of grassmann fermion fields @xmath55 , @xmath27 can be derived from the equivalent action @xmath56",
    "\\chi_\\alpha+\\bar\\zeta_\\alpha m^\\dagger[\\sigma,\\vec\\pi]\\zeta_\\alpha\\right)+{{2n}\\over g^2}\\sum_x(\\sigma^2+\\vec\\pi.\\vec\\pi ) .",

    "/}\\,),\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath58 a shorthand for the free kinetic term for staggered lattice fermions .",
    "so , we see that the action ( [ s_bos ] ) describes @xmath59 flavors of lattice fermion , but with a flavor symmetry group @xmath60 .",
    "the interaction term in ( [ s],[sfer ] ) has been normalised so that the gap equation coming from the leading order @xmath61 approximation agrees with that derived for lattice gross - neveu models having @xmath62 @xcite or u(1 ) @xcite chiral symmetries .",
    "next we identify the global su(2)@xmath63su(2 ) chiral symmetry of the lattice model .",
    "this is most manifest in the form ( [ s ] ) .",
    "let @xmath64 be even and odd site projectors defined by @xmath65 then , noting that @xmath66 etc , we find that ( [ s ] ) is invariant , in the chiral limit @xmath67 , under the combined transformation : @xmath68 where @xmath69 are independent su(2 ) rotations .",
    "note that ( [ su(2 ) ] ) is a symmetry because @xmath70 is proportional to a su(2 ) matrix , and the auxiliary potential proportional to @xmath71 .",
    "this property does not generalise to larger unitary groups . the symmetry ( [ su(2 ) ] ) is broken explicitly by a bare fermion mass , and spontaneously by the condensates @xmath72 .",
    "now let us consider the continuum flavor interpretation .",
    "it is well known that four - dimensional staggered lattice fermions can be interpreted in terms of four flavors of dirac fermion , which decouple at tree level in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "one way of seeing this is via a transformation to fields @xmath73 defined on the sites @xmath74 of a lattice of spacing @xmath75 @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 run over spin degrees of freedom , @xmath78 over flavor , and @xmath79 is a four - vector with entries either 0 or 1 which identifies the corners of the elementary hypercube associated with site @xmath74 ; each site @xmath44 on the original lattice is thus mapped to a unique combination @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath81 matrix @xmath82 , where @xmath83 are dirac matrices .",
    "the action written in the form ( [ s ] ) contains interaction terms of the form @xmath84 , @xmath85 etc . in the @xmath86-basis",
    "the @xmath45 and @xmath87 fields are not all equivalent .",
    "if we label the dual site @xmath88 by @xmath89 , then for @xmath90 the interaction reads @xmath91 where the first matrix in the direct product acts on spin degrees of freedom , and the second on flavor .",
    "equation ( [ int0 ] ) resembles the continuum interaction between fermions and the auxiliary scalars , except that the pseudoscalar current is non - singlet ( but diagonalisable ) in flavor space .",
    "however , for @xmath92 , say , the interaction is more complicated : @xmath93 \\nonumber\\\\ + i\\vec\\pi(&\\mu&;\\tilde y).\\left[\\bar q(y)\\vec\\tau(\\gamma_5\\otimes\\gamma_5^*)q(y)+{1\\over2}\\delta_\\mu^+ \\left(\\bar q(y)\\vec\\tau(\\gamma_5\\otimes\\gamma_5^*)q(y)+ \\bar q(y)\\vec\\tau(\\gamma_\\mu\\otimes\\gamma_\\mu^*)q(y)\\right)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the forward difference operator on the @xmath74-lattice .",
    "hence in addition to continuum - like interactions there are extra momentum - dependent terms coupling the auxiliary fields to bilinears which do not respect lorentz or flavor covariance . for @xmath79 vectors with more non - zero entries",
    "there are still more complicated interactions containing more derivative terms",
    ".    one might naively claim that the terms in @xmath95 are @xmath96 and hence irrelevant in the continuum limit .",
    "this ignores the fact that @xmath45 and @xmath87 are auxiliary fields which have no kinetic terms to suppress high momentum modes in the functional integral .",
    "the non - covariant terms will thus survive integration over @xmath97 to manifest themselves in ( [ sfer ] ) .",
    "a similar phenomenon happens in lattice formulations of the njl model in which the interaction term is localised on a single link @xcite@xcite .",
    "the effects of the non - covariant terms in fact depend on the details of the model s dynamics .",
    "if long - range correlations develop among the auxiliary fields , ie .",
    "if an effective kinetic term is generated by radiative corrections , then the @xmath98 term may become irrelevant  this appears to be the case in two @xcite@xcite and three @xcite dimensional models , where in each case there is a renormalisable expansion available . in four dimensions",
    "the njl model is trivial : hence no continuum limit exists . even in this case , though , we expect correlations to develop between the auxiliary fields in the vicinity of the continuous chiral symmetry breaking transition . in this case",
    "the unwanted interactions would manifest themselves as scaling violations if an interacting effective theory is to be described @xcite .    from the arguments following ( [ sfer ] ) and ( [ q ] )",
    "we now state the relation between the parameter @xmath36 and the number of continuum flavors @xmath1 : @xmath99 the extra factor of 2 over the usual relation for four - dimensional gauge theories arises from the impossibility of even / odd partitioning in the dual site approach to lattice four - fermi models : in other words the matrix @xmath48 contains diagonal terms which are not multiples of the unit matrix . in this paper",
    "we wish to study a small number of continuum flavors @xmath31 , which necessitates a fractional @xmath100 .",
    "this can be achieved using a hybrid algorithm , which produces a sequence of configurations weighted according to the action ( [ hybrid ] ) by hamiltonian evolution in a fictitious time @xmath101 @xcite , the fields conjugate momenta being stochastically refreshed at intervals .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that in the form ( [ hybrid ] ) the variable @xmath36 can readily be set to a non - integer value ( though there is no longer a transformation to a local action of the form ( [ sfer ] ) ) ; the cost is that the simulation must be run with a discrete timestep @xmath35 . in principle",
    "several values of @xmath35 must be explored , then the limit @xmath102 taken .",
    "we have chosen to implement the `` r - algorithm '' of gottlieb _ et al _ @xcite , for which the systematic error is claimed to be @xmath103 .    we have tested the r - algorithm by extensive runs on a @xmath104 lattice with parameters @xmath105 and mass @xmath106 , the coupling being chosen to lie well into the broken symmetry phase according to the leading order gap equation ( see below ) .",
    "we tested models with @xmath107 and 6 , with timesteps @xmath108 ( for@xmath109 ) , 0.2 , 0.1 and 0.05 . for integer @xmath36",
    "we were also able to run directly in the @xmath110 limit using an exact hybrid monte carlo algorithm @xcite@xcite .",
    "we ran for either 20000 ( @xmath111 ) or 40000 ( @xmath112 ) hamiltonian trajectories between momentum refreshments , the trajectory lengths being drawn from a poisson distribution with mean 1.0 .    for illustration we present results for two local quantities ,",
    "the expectation value of the scalar field @xmath113 , and the energy density @xmath114 given by @xmath115 the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sigvsdt ] and [ fig : epsvsdt ] , together with quadratic fits of the form @xmath116 acceptable fits were found for all datasets except for the @xmath22 data at @xmath117 , where the fit was restricted to @xmath118 .",
    "we find good evidence that the systematic error is indeed @xmath103 .",
    "moreover , the coefficients @xmath119 and @xmath120 are themselves adequately fitted by the forms @xmath121 , @xmath122 as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : abvsn ] .",
    "this behaviour is expected from inspection of the hybrid equations of motion @xcite@xcite .",
    "since fluctuations in the system are suppressed by powers of @xmath61 , we see that for @xmath100 systematic errors are likely to be dwarfed by statistical ones for reasonable simulation runs . in the work presented in the rest of this paper we took @xmath123 just to be conservative and safe .",
    "in fact , for very small or vanishing bare mass @xmath24 near the critical point where the order parameter is very small , we also did production runs with @xmath124 to check explicitly that the systematic errors were smaller than the statistical errors .",
    "the bulk of the results of this paper were generated on a @xmath37 lattice with @xmath100 , using masses @xmath24 ranging from 0.05 down to 0.0025 .",
    "we have focussed our attention on the order parameter @xmath22 , which differs from zero in the chiral limit only when chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , and is simply related to the chiral condensate : @xmath125 .",
    "our results for @xmath22 as a function of bare mass @xmath24 and inverse coupling @xmath126 are presented in tab .",
    "[ tab : data ] .",
    "because the kinetic matrix @xmath48 contains numerically large diagonal terms , this model is relatively cheap to simulate compared to , say , non - compact qed .",
    "this has enabled us to accumulate a large dataset , reflected in the relatively small statistical errors in tab .",
    "[ tab : data ] .",
    "typical runs which resulted in each of the entries in that table were between 15,000 and 30,000 @xmath101 units long .",
    "such statistics are an order of magnitude better than present day state - of - the - art lattice qcd simulations .",
    "the statistical error bars in the table were obtained by binning methods which are particularly reliable when applied to such substantial data sets .",
    "in fact , because the interactions appear on the diagonal , @xmath48 is sufficiently well - conditioned in the broken phase to permit simulations directly in the chiral limit @xmath6 . of course",

    "perhaps the lack of numerical accuracy of the gap equation is because the @xmath61 expansion is not renormalisable in four dimensions .",

    "first we list the functional forms we have examined , in increasing order of sophistication :    1 .   mean field ( 3 parameters ) : @xmath141 this is the simplest form , arising from a mean field treatment neglecting fluctuations in the order parameter field .",
    "2 .   power law ( 5 parameters ) : @xmath142 this is a more general version of i , derivable by renormalisation group arguments from the assumption that a fixed point exists at the transition corresponding to a diverging ratio between cutoff and physical scales . a useful discussion is found in @xcite .",
    "the index @xmath143 is the standard critical exponent , and @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is another standard exponent .",

    "@xmath148 , @xmath149 ) , but with logarithmic scaling corrections .",
    "since these corrections introduce a dependence on some ultraviolet scale , they imply that the renormalised theory near the fixed point can never be made independent of the cutoff , and hence that the continuum limit is described by a free field theory  this is the phenomenon of triviality .",

    "sigma model logarithmic corrections ( 4 parameters ) : @xmath151 here the powers of the logarithmic terms are derived on the assumption that the effective field theory at the fixed point is the o(4 ) linear sigma model , which has the same pattern of symmetry breaking as our su(2)@xmath63su(2 ) model .",
    "note that we include @xmath152 , the uv scale of the logarithm , as a free parameter .",

    "2 .   modified sigma model logarithmic corrections ( 5 parameters ) : @xmath154 here we allow the powers of the logarithms to vary .",
    "this phenomenological form has been used extensively in fits of the equation of state of both non - compact lattice qed @xcite@xcite and the u(1 ) njl model @xcite . note that we have set the uv scale in the logarithm to 1 ; fits in which both @xmath155 and @xmath152 are allowed to vary are inherently unstable , since @xmath156 , so that as @xmath157 the functional forms become so similar that the covariance matrix becomes singular .",
    "large-@xmath36 logarithmic corrections ( 4 parameters ) : @xmath158 this form is predicted for the njl model in the large-@xmath36 limit @xcite , and was used to fit data from the four dimensional @xmath159 njl model in @xcite .",
    "there are important qualitative differences between form vi and the previous forms iv , v , due to the different role of the logarithmic term  i.e. the `` effective '' value of the exponent @xmath143 measured at the critical coupling is larger than the mean field value 3 for iv and v , but smaller than 3 for fit vi .",
    "we also tried to fit slightly modified forms of iv  vi , eg , allowing separate scales in the logarithms , but the results were either unstable , or not sufficiently distinct from the six forms presented here to be worth reporting .",
    "as we shall see , the main issue to arise when assessing the various forms ( [ eq : fit1]-[eq : fit6 ] ) is how much of the data to include in the fit .",

    "this enables better fits , which are also characterised by a smaller value for @xmath162 ; to see why consider a fisher plot of the data , in which @xmath164 is plotted against @xmath165 .",
    "the fisher plot is designed so that the mean field equation of state ( [ eq : fit1 ] ) yields curves of constant @xmath126 which are straight lines of uniform slope , intercepting the vertical axis as @xmath67 in the broken phase , the horizontal axis as @xmath67 in the symmetric phase , and passing through the origin as @xmath67 for @xmath14 .",
    "any departures from mean field behaviour show up as curvature in and variation in spacing between lines of uniformly spaced values of @xmath126 .    in fig .",

    "it is worth noting that forms ii and v gave fits of similar quality when applied both to simulation results of both the u(1 ) njl model @xcite and non - compact qed @xcite ; clearly the logarithmic correction of ( [ eq : fit5 ] ) can equally well be modelled by an effective @xmath166 .",
    "we have checked that fits ii and v were stable under exclusion of @xmath167 , and also under exclusion of the low mass points @xmath168 .    a study of figs .",
    "[ fig : fish2narrow],[fig : fish5narrow ] however , indicates that fits ii and v are least satisfactory for the low mass points closest to the origin .",
    "this has led us to explore an alternative scaling window , in which all @xmath126 values are kept , but high mass points are excluded .",
    "results from just keeping the 29 points corresponding to @xmath169 are given in tab .",
    "[ tab : fit3 ] , and those for the 40 points obtained by also including @xmath106 in tab .",
    "[ tab : fit4 ] .",
    "the picture changes dramatically : the @xmath39 values from fits iii and vi are now much smaller and comparable to those from fits ii and v , though for @xmath170 ( tab . [",
    "tab : fit3 ] ) the two 5 parameter fits still yield the lowest values . once",
    "@xmath106 points are included , fits ii , iii , v and vi are virtually indistinguishable in quality .",
    "what has happened is that the data from this window prefer an effective value of @xmath155 much closer to 1 , and an effective @xmath143 now less than 3 .",
    "this results , e.g. in the value of @xmath171 in fit v being very small , almost consistent with zero .",
    "the most impressive effect is that the logarithmic correction of form vi is now acting in the correct way to fit the data , moreover with a reasonable value for the uv scale @xmath152 : in fit v this manifests itself in a relatively large _ negative _ value for the exponent @xmath172 .",
    "the form iv , which assigns a positive value to @xmath172 , is unstable .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : fish2wide ] and [ fig : fish6wide ] we show fisher plots for the forms ii and vi respectively , using the fit parameters of tab .",
    "[ tab : fit4 ] , showing that the fits are indeed successful over a wide range of @xmath126 at the expense of missing the higher mass points .",
    "the even spacing of the lines of constant @xmath126 in the broken phase is responsible for forcing the effective value of @xmath155 to one .",
    "the values of @xmath39 per degree of freedom for the four successful fits are slightly too high for us to claim that they are the last word on understanding the model s equation of state . even though the fits reproduce the spacing of the data in @xmath126 , close inspection of figs .",
    "[ fig : fish2wide ] and [ fig : fish6wide ] suggests that the variation of the data with @xmath24 in the broken phase is not so well - described  clearly more low mass data will be needed to settle the issue , which in turn will require a quantitative understanding of finite volume corrections .",
    "we can claim , however , that there appears to be a dramatic switch in the preferred form of the equation of state according to whether the scaling window is chosen long and thin or short and fat in the @xmath160 plane . in the next section",
    "we will consider data taken directly in the chiral limit , and find indirect evidence to support the short fat option .",
    "in the previous section we made no attempt to correct for finite volume effects in the measurements of @xmath22 . from test runs for @xmath173 at @xmath174 on different - sized lattices , shown in tab . [",
    "tab : datafv ] , finite volume effects are clearly present on a @xmath130 system , but the difference between @xmath37 and @xmath131 , though statistically significant , is less than 2% .",
    "we hope , therefore , that finite volume corrections would have no impact on the qualitative conclusions of the previous section .",
    "finite volume effects are numerically important , however , when considering measurements of the quantity @xmath129 made with @xmath6 , defined in ( [ eq : phi ] ) and shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : datam0 ] .",
    "naively , we expect that in a finite system @xmath129 differs from the true order parameter @xmath22 extrapolated to the chiral limit , because in the absence of a symmetry breaking term it is impossible to disentangle fluctuations of the order parameter field from those of the goldstone modes ; including the effects of the latter will give @xmath175 , where @xmath176 denotes the value of @xmath22 in the chiral limit . only in the thermodynamic limit @xmath177",
    "do we expect the goldstone modes to average to zero and the two quantities to coincide .",
    "this phenomenon also occurs in numerical studies of scalar field theory , and has been analysed for the o(4 ) sigma model in @xcite .",
    "formally , @xmath129 corresponds to the minimum of a `` constraint effective potential '' in a finite volume @xmath9 ; for the o(4 ) sigma model this can be calculated using renormalised perturbation theory .",
    "there is indeed a correction due to the goldstone modes which is intrinsically @xmath178 .",
    "numerically , however , a far more significant correction to the calculation arises from the need to renormalise the model in order to relate lattice parameters to measured quantities . to one - loop order",
    "this results in a relation @xcite @xmath179 where @xmath180 , @xmath181 are the renormalised scalar mass and coupling strength , @xmath182 is the linear size of the system , and @xmath27 is the wavefunction renormalisation constant , defined as the coefficient of @xmath183 in the unrenormalised pion propagator in the limit @xmath184 .",
    "the factor @xmath185 is a slowly varying function of @xmath186 which accounts for the difference between one - loop integrals evaluated in finite and infinite volumes ( for further background see @xcite ) .",
    "a fit to ( [ eq : gock ] ) for magnetisation data in the sigma model is given in fig .",
    "2 of @xcite .    for the njl model",
    "there is no reason for renormalised perturbation theory to apply ; however since the effective theory in the broken phase is similar to the sigma model , in the sense that it has the same light scalar degrees of freedom , we expect a result similar to ( [ eq : gock ] ) to hold .",
    "we will therefore attempt to account for the finite volume correction @xmath187 with the formula @xmath188 where the @xmath185 factor has been set constant , and higher order effects are ignored .",
    "the first prediction of ( [ eq : delta ] ) is that @xmath189 . to test this ,",

    "from the data of tab . [",
    "tab : datam0 ] we see that @xmath129 decreases with @xmath182 as predicted .",

    "[ tab : fit2 ] ( the corresponding fisher plot is shown in fig . [",

    "this is already equal to the value of @xmath129 on a @xmath130 lattice , and lies above @xmath129 on larger systems , making it difficult to see how ( [ eq : delta ] ) applies .",
    "the second estimate comes from assuming a wide scaling window in @xmath126 but excluding higher mass data .",
    "this was best described using form vi ( [ eq : fit6 ] ) using the parameters of tab . [",

    "we find that @xmath198 is approximately constant , which supports the hypothesis ( [ eq : delta ] ) .",
    "next we examine the dependence of @xmath199 on @xmath126 , and hence @xmath176 , using data from the broken phase of the model taken from a constant volume of @xmath37 .",
    "the data of tab [ tab : datam0 ] were used in conjunction with the same two fits for @xmath176 to produce the two sets of values for @xmath199 given in tab . [ tab : delta ] .",
    "the quoted errors are the statistical errors in the measurement of @xmath129 , and take no account of errors in extrapolating @xmath22 to the chiral limit .",
    "the values @xmath200 obtained using form v actually change sign over the range of @xmath126 explored , and clearly can not be fitted by any relation of the form ( [ eq : delta ] ) .",

    "how do we reconcile this observation with ( [ eq : delta ] ) , which apparently predicts @xmath203 ?",
    "the answer lies in the field dependence of the wavefunction renormalisation constant @xmath27 , which differs markedly between the ferromagnetic o(4 ) sigma model and the fermionic njl model @xcite@xcite@xcite . in the sigma model",
    ", @xmath27 is perturbatively close to 1 ( as borne out by the data of @xcite ) , and hence @xmath203 . in the njl model , on the other hand , the large-@xmath1 approximation predicts @xmath204 @xcite , and hence @xmath205 we can see this using another argument . in both sigma and njl models , a ward identity plus the assumption that both conserved current and transverse field couple principally to the goldstone mode ( in particle physics",
    "this mode is the pion , and the assumption is pcac ) , leads to the relation @xcite @xmath206 where @xmath41 is the coupling to the axial current , or in the context of hadronic physics the pion decay constant .",
    "we thus have @xmath207 now , in the large-@xmath1 approximation ( see appendix for an explicit calculation ) , @xmath208 yielding once again the relation ( [ eq : delta2 ] ) .",
    "note that both scenarios predict triviality of the resulting theory . in the njl model , in the large-@xmath1 treatment @xmath176 is a physical scale related to the renormalised fermion and scalar masses .",

    "this fit is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : delvsbeta ] . in either case",
    "it is reassuring that the uv scale of the logarithm is close to unity .",
    "it is also interesting that the fit accounts for the slight curvature in the plot , though this aspect is not tightly constrained by the current error bars .",
    "the fitted curve also rises sharply to pass close to the excluded point .    to conclude , we can account for our finite volume effects in the chiral limit under three assumptions :    1 .   that the equation of state fits to the @xmath22 data from the @xmath37 lattice in the previous section , when extrapolated to the chiral limit ,",

    "3 .   that the finite volume correction has the form ( [ eq : delta2 ] ) .",
    "the latter two assumptions are consistent with logarithmic corrections of the form advocated in @xcite , which differ qualitatively from those used to describe triviality in scalar field theory .",
    "it would appear that for the lattice sizes and bare masses used in this study , which are close to state - of - the - art ( though recall that dual - site four - fermi models are relatively cheap to simulate ) , it is still difficult to distinguish different patterns of triviality , or indeed distinguish a trivial from a non - trivial fixed point , purely on the basis of fits to model equations of state ; different assumptions about the size and shape of the scaling region result in different best fits . only once the analysis of sec .",

    "our principal conclusion is thus that the form ( [ eq : eosnjl ] ) , ( [ eq : fit6 ] ) is qualitatively correct beyond leading order in the @xmath15 expansion .",
    "the sensitivity of the preferred form of the equation of state to the shape of the assumed scaling window has implications for similar studies in related fermionic models , noteably the u(1 ) njl model studied using the `` link '' formulation @xcite , and non - compact @xmath30 @xcite ; the two recent studies cited attempt fits based on the power law form ( [ eq : fit2 ] ) and the modified sigma model form ( [ eq : fit5 ] ) , and find the two forms difficult to distinguish on the basis of @xmath39 alone ( in other words , a value of @xmath166 is difficult to distinguish from a logarithmic correction with @xmath222 ) . in tab .",
