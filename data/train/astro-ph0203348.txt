    "the observation of ultra high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) and high - energy neutrinos ( he-@xmath1 s ) with directional accuracy of @xmath2 arcmin (  ) is expected to lead to revolutionary progress in particle astrophysics through `` multi - particle '' observations in cooperation with multi - wavelength astronomical observations .",
    "an excellent example is the recent prompt observation of x - rays from a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) with directional precision of 1 by beppo - sax , an event that marked the start of multi - wavelength observations using many advanced astronomical telescopes @xcite .",
    "the directional accuracy of 1 is several tens times better than that of @xmath3 currently operating , constructing , or planning uhecr detectors @xcite aim for .    upon entering the atmosphere ,",
    "uhecrs produce an air shower ( as ) through interaction with air nuclei .",
    "the as axis coincides with the uhecr incident angle , and the intrinsic angular resolution of the shower is 0.3 or smaller for a uhecr of 10@xmath4  ev .",
    "this narrow dispersion results from the high lorenz factor of secondary particles ( @xmath5 ) in the direction of the parent particle , and the very low transverse momenta of secondary particles ( rarely exceeding 1  gev / c ) as reported by the atlas group @xcite . for uhecrs",
    ", more precise reconstruction of the primary direction can be expected due to the higher lorenz factor .",
    "ass can be detected via the isotropic fluorescence emission of the air nitrogen that it excites .",
    "an optical system with imaging devices can be used to track the longitudinal development of an as .",
    "this technique was first employed in the fly s eye detector  @xcite and will be part of several future projects on uhecr detection . the key advantage of fluorescence detection is the capacity for achieving fine angular resolution . the signal to noise ratio ( @xmath6 ) for each pixel of the imaging devices is inversely proportional to the square root of the angular diameter of the field of view ( fov ) .",
    "a better @xmath6 will allow the device to trigger charge levels , making it possible to analyze less energetic or more distant events .",
    "galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields are considered to have intensities on the order of @xmath7 g , ng , and below @xcite .",
    "thus , uhecrs are expected to experience only slight deflection due to galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields , and can not be confined by the galactic magnetic field .",
    "the existence of an `` ankle '' at @xmath8  ev is often interpreted as a crossover from a steeper galactic component to a harder component of extragalactic origin .    as the possible sources of astrophysical accelerators capable of producing uhecrs",
    "are very limited , uhecrs that have been deflected only slightly can be traced back to their sources .",
    "thus , high - resolution measurements of the arrival direction will lead to significant progress in cosmic - ray astronomy .",
    "the magnetic deflection of uhecrs during propagation induces charge separation .",
    "one of the important implications of 1 angular resolution is that this separation of charge can be resolved , allowing unambiguous particle identification to be performed based on the deflection from sources .",
    "such observations may also allow us to study the structure of extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "based on the above considerations , we propose a telescope design that features a fov of 50 @xmath0 @xmath9 50 @xmath0 and 1 resolution for the arrival direction .",
    "this is realized through a combination of a large - area image intensifier ( ii ) connected to a ccd camera  @xcite and a customized baker - nunn optical system . in this paper",
    ", we describe the conceptual design of the modified baker - nunn optical system .",
    "the expected performance of the telescopes for uhecr detection is also presented assuming that the image resolution of the ccd camera is better than that of the optical system .",
    "our design requirements can be summarized as follows :    1 .   a large fov of 50@xmath0 @xmath9 50@xmath0 to cover a large solid angle for uhecr detection ; 2 .",
    "an image resolution of @xmath100.02@xmath0 to achieve 1 resolution for the arrival direction ; 3 .   a large caliber with a diameter of @xmath102000  mm to distinguish faint fluorescence .",
    "in addition , cost performance will be a critical issue with respect to construction of a large - aperture array of telescopes .    among several approaches to meet our requirements",
    ", spherical - mirror optics with an aperture diaphragm on the mirror s curvature center appears to offer some advantages for the proposed telescope .",
    "this simple optics produces homogeneous images within the entire fov .",
    "typical off - axis aberrations , principally coma aberration , are eliminated , although spherical aberration is a factor .",
    "thus , from a review of the variants of this optics , the schmidt , makstov , baker super - schmidt , and baker - nunn optics were selected as candidates .",
    "the schmidt optics has a one - element corrector lens at the diaphragm , and provides higher resolution than optics without the corrector lens .",
    "however , we found that it was difficult to achieve the required image resolution over the wide fov .",
    "the makstov and baker super - schmidt optical systems require thick corrector lenses , and as such are not suited to large - scale telescopes .",
    "the baker - nunn optics has a three - element corrector lens consisting of convex and concave lenses with spherical or aspherical surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the basic premise of this optics is that each element has easy - to - make spherical surfaces , residual spherical aberration after assembly can be canceled by adjusting the spacing between lens elements , and chromatic aberration can be eliminated by selecting appropriate lens materials .",
    "figure  [ fig : optics ] shows a schematic of the baker - nunn optics .",
    "the second lens element is an aperture diaphragm .",
    "although the advantages of the baker - nunn optics are not related directly to the specific area of improvement pursued in the proposed design , the three - element corrector lens in this optics provides a large degree of freedom for optimization . as a result",
    ", it is considered the most suitable for our purposes . in our design , the first and third lens elements are 2400  mm in diameter , and the second element is 2000  mm in diameter , and all elements are 10  mm thick .",
    "considering the cost , and complexity of fabrication processes , we designed the corrector lens as an acrylic fresnel lens as appropriate for a large - aperture telescope .",
    "as described in the following section , the surface shape of each lens element was determined through an optimization process .",
    "we developed ray - tracing program written in c++ in order to optimize the optical system and examine its performance .",
    "the program models the refraction and reflection of incident rays on each surface , and allows a bundle of on- and off - axis rays to be traced numerically . as is common in designing an optical system , the shape of the front surface of each optical component is expressed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 represent the surface sag , radial height , and curvature of the surface .",
    "@xmath12 is positive in the direction of on - axis incident rays .",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 represent the 4th , 6th , and 8th order aspheric coefficients .",
    "the surfaces of each lens element and the mirror are numbered 1 to 7 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : optics ] .",
    "the focal surface is defined as the surface minimizing the image spot for a bundle of parallel rays .",
    "the spot size is defined as the root mean square ( rms ) of positions of parallel rays at the focal surface .",
    "the fineness of the bundle of rays analyzed is determined according to the purpose of ray tracing : a rather rough interval between rays is selected for optimization , and a fine interval is selected for performance evaluation . the spot size ( @xmath18 )",
    "is a function of the incident angle ( @xmath19 ) and the wavelength ( @xmath20 ) of parallel rays .",
    "we used the modified powell s method as the algorithm for optimization based on the following evaluation function : @xmath21 where @xmath19 varies from 0@xmath0 to 25@xmath0 , and @xmath20 varies from 330 to 410  nm , taking into account the air - fluorescence emission spectrum .",
    "we adopted the fourth power of spot size as the evaluation function in order to obtain flat resolution over the entire fov .    in principle , the curvature , aspheric coefficients , thickness , and position of each lens element are free parameters in optimization . in order to reduce the number of free parameters",
    ", we imposed the symmetry described in ref .",
    "@xcite in which the corrector lens is symmetric with respect to the plane including the center of the second element and which is perpendicular to the axis of the ray .",
    "in addition , the thickness and position of each surface were fixed .",
    "these constraints allowed much more efficient optimization .",
    "the optimized parameters of the optical system are given in table  [ tab : optim - params ] .",
    "the axis and origin of the @xmath12 coordinate are coincident with the axis of the rays and the center of the corrector lens .",
    "note that we took the effect of the region obscured by the focal surface into account in the optimization .",

    "the surface sag remained well below 0.5  mm when the width of fresnel grooves was chosen to be 10 mm .",
    "thus , the 10-mm thickness of each lens element is sufficient , although the thickness may be changed according to the support method employed for the corrector lens .",
    "we confirmed that the same level of spot - size resolution can be obtained by another optimization using a different lens thickness .",
    "figure  [ fig : spot ] shows the spot diagrams of the optimized optical system .",
    "the shape and size of spot diagrams changed with the wavelength and the incident angle of the incoming rays .",
    "the four strongest fluorescence peaks , @xmath45  336 ,  358 ,  391 , and  425  nm , which dominate the filtered fluorescence spectrum after propagation through air , were selected as wavelengths for the diagrams .",
    "the spot diagrams for incident angles of 5@xmath0 , 15@xmath0 , and 25@xmath0 are shown .",
    "figure  [ fig : reso ] shows the spot size distribution as a function of incident angle , taking the characteristic wavelengths in the fluorescence spectrum into account .",
    "solid and dashed curves represent the spot size optimized to cover a fov of @xmath4625@xmath0 and @xmath4620@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the lens parameters shown in table  [ tab : optim - params ] are the result of the former optimization , and give a spot size of smaller than 0.02@xmath0 over a fov of @xmath4625@xmath0 .",
    "the results were confirmed by cross checks using mathematica optica @xcite with correction for the refractive index of the atmosphere .        in parallel with the development of this optical system ,",
    "the present authors have also developed a high - density ccd imaging detector with integrated large - area image intensifier , which has been demonstrated to have a resolution of @xmath10 0.02@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this imaging system is mounted at the focal surface of the optimized optics to give the proposed telescope design .",
    "a solid angle of nearly 2@xmath47 sr can be observed using an array of 8 telescopes ( i.e. , a station ) , with 7 telescopes arranged azimuthally and 1 telescope directed upward .",
    "it should be noted that the telescope directed upward is primarily important in he-@xmath1 detection rather than uhecr detection @xcite .",
    "a monte carlo simulation was performed to examine the resolution obtained for the arrival direction of uhecrs .",
    "the event generator calculated the signal strength produced by atmospheric fluorescence emission from ass with a given geometry , and built simulation events by calculating the number of photoelectrons detected by each pixel of a ccd camera at each mirror .",
    "the simulation includes the longitudinal and lateral profiles of the as , the model of the atmosphere , the air fluorescence yield , and the detector optics .",
    "we also took into account fluctuation of the first interaction depth , impact point , and directional angles of shower cores assuming appropriate distributions .",
    "current and planned fluorescence detectors @xcite have a pixel resolution of @xmath101@xmath0 .",
    "the angular resolution of the reconstructed track was evaluated by analyzing event samples that triggered the current 1@xmath0-pixel detectors .",
    "such signals are triggered by having at least 6 pixels ( @xmath48 resolution ) fire at 4@xmath49 greater than the night sky background , with a corresponding reconstructed track extending more than 5@xmath0 in the fov @xcite .",
    "a night sky background level of 100 photoelectrons/@xmath7s/(@xmath50 ) was assumed .",

    "note that this proportionality holds only when the effects of lateral distribution are neglected .",
    "assuming the same size of @xmath15 , the @xmath6 value for the 0.02@xmath0-pixel imaging device is expected to be about 7 times higher than that from the 1@xmath0-pixel one .",
