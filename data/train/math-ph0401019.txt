    "the purpose of these notes is to give a compact exposition of the way we have been thinking about the relationships between stochastic schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) and conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "part of the material is an abridged , but hopefully readable , version of previously published work .",
    "our approach consists in using cft to probe sle hulls .",
    "however , we have tried to put more emphasis on general features .",
    "the other part contains some new remarks . in the short description that follows ,",
    "we stress the original points that do not appear elsewhere in our previous work .    in the first part , we look at the relationship between stochastic loewner evolution ( sle ) and conformal field theory ( cft ) with emphasis on conformal covariance .",
    "we stress the role of two vector fields that underly the geometry of conformally covariant stochastic differential equations . the possibility to embed the lie algebra they generate in a manageable lie sub - algebra of the virasoro algebra is at the heart of the sle - cft relationship .",
    "we treat from this unified geometric viewpoint the definition of sle and its connection with cft under two symmetry conditions : the domain and the boundary conditions for sle should be invariant under a one parameter group of conformal automorphisms and under an involution . apart from the well studied chordal and radial cases ,",
    "these conditions are met in two cases , dipolar and annular sle .",
    "we have not met the dipolar case in the previous literature .",
    "it has the property that dipolar sle hulls never touch a forbidden interval on the boundary .",
    "the annular case involves a simple moduli space .",
    "these two cases have not yet been investigated thoroughly .",
    "next we recall how a special representation of the virasoro algebra , degenerate at level 2 , allows to construct a martingale generating function for sle and we explain the cft physical picture that underlies this construction .",
    "we give details for the chordal case , and brief discussions of the other , slightly more involved , three cases . a short discussion of the explicit implementation of conformal transformations in cft follows , together with its applications to the virasoro wick theorem and to representation theory .",
    "this is then used to define cfts in the complement of the sle hulls which is the key point for coupling cfts to sles .",
    "the purpose of the second part is to illustrate , in the example of chordal sle , how to perform probabilistic sle computations in the cft framework .",
    "we review briefly the cft interpretation of the restriction martingale as a cft partition function .",
    "we then turn to boundary and bulk properties of the hulls by relating the probability that the sle trace zig - zags in a prescribed order through a finite number of small balls ( small intervals on the boundary , small disks in the bulk ) to an explicit correlation function in cft . after a review of previously computed functions , we treat some new manageable cases explicitly .",
    "we also present a cft computation of the fractal dimension of the sle trace .",
    "the conformal operators involved in all these probabilities , as well as their dimensions , are explicited . however to completely specify the value of the correlation functions , the intermediate states ( or conformal blocks ) that propagate from one operator to the next have to be determined .",
    "for that we do not have a general answer and we have to rely on a case by case analysis using the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "nevertheless , the answer to this well posed problem contains important data because , due to the extended structure of the hulls , the bulk correlation functions depend on the order of visits which means that some non trivial cft monodromies , alias braiding relations , quantum group actions and yangians should appear naturally in sles .",
    "from a general point of view , stochastic schramm - loewner evolutions @xcite describe , by means of a stochastic differential equation , the growth of random curves or hulls emerging from the boundary of a riemann surface .",
    "one of the crucial features should be conformal covariance , in the sense that if two riemann surfaces are related by a conformal map @xmath0 , respective sle samples should be related by @xmath0 as well .",
    "although interesting attempts have been made @xcite , the implementation of sle in such a general setting is still in its infancy .",
    "the situations that have been thoroughly studied up to now is when the riemann surface is a simply connected domain @xmath1 in the complex plane and the hulls either connect two points on the boundary @xmath2 ( chordal sle ) or one point on the boundary and one in the bulk of @xmath1 ( radial sle ) , see refs.@xcite . in the following , we shall try to abstract common features of these two cases and use these to look at two little known examples .",
    "our starting point is a discussion of conformal covariance for stochastic differential equations in the following sense .",
    "it is well known that trajectories of points on manifolds are related to vector fields .",
    "the case of interest for us is when the manifold is a riemann surface @xmath3 .",
    "suppose @xmath4 is a coordinate system for some open subset of @xmath3 and @xmath0 maps @xmath5 conformally to some domain @xmath6 .",
    "suppose that an intrinsic motion of points on @xmath3 , when written in the local coordinate in @xmath5 , satisfies the family of differential equations @xmath7 , with initial conditions @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is holomorphic in @xmath5 . then , when written in the local coordinate in @xmath10 , the corresponding map is @xmath11 , which satisfies @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "this equation expresses that @xmath14 is a holomorphic vector field on some open subset of @xmath3 .",
    "what happens now if the motion on @xmath3 is stochastic ?",
    "suppose that @xmath15 a brownian motion with covariance @xmath16=\\kappa\\ , { \\rm min}(t , s)$ ] and that the motion , read in @xmath5 , satisfies @xmath17 in the following sense : for each trajectory @xmath15 there is a random but almost surely positive time @xmath18 and a nonempty open domain @xmath19 such that @xmath20 maps @xmath21 into @xmath5 and solves the above differential equation for @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23 .",
    "then , by it s formula , the motion read in @xmath10 satisfies @xmath24 with @xmath25 , and @xmath26 by a simple rearrangement , this means that @xmath27 are holomorphic vector fields on an open subset of @xmath3 . under the motion , some points may leave this open subset before time @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding random subsets of @xmath5 and @xmath10 are related by @xmath0 .    to make contact with group theory ,",
    "let us assume that _ i ) _ there is a linear space @xmath29 of holomorphic functions and a group @xmath30 that ( anti ) acts faithfully on @xmath29 by composition @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and _",
    "ii ) _ that @xmath34 , at least up to a possibly random but strictly positive time . in this situation",
    "we may view @xmath20 as a random process on @xmath30 . for chordal and radial sle we shall exhibit appropriate @xmath29 and @xmath30 later .",
    "it s formula shows that @xmath35 , or equivalently @xmath36 this equation involves only intrinsic geometric objects .",
    "it is at the heart of the relation between sle and conformal field theory",
    ". eq.([slecov ] ) can be transformed into an ordinary differential equation for @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 , which satisfies @xmath39 .",
    "the structure of the lie algebra generated by @xmath40 and @xmath41 plays an important role , and the possibility to embed this lie algebra in the virasoro algebra is crucial . recall that the virasoro algebra @xmath42 is the lie algebra generated by @xmath43 with commutation relations : @xmath44 = ( n - m)l_{n+m } + \\frac{c}{12}(n^3-n ) \\delta_{n+m,0 } \\qquad [ c , l_n]=0 . \\label{viral}\\ ] ] it is the ( essentially unique ) central extension of the lie algebra of laurent polynomial vector fields in @xmath45 via the map @xmath46 .",
    "the relevant properties of @xmath42 and its representations will be presented in section [ sec : cftchorsle ] .",
    "chordal sle @xcite describes the local random growth of hulls between two points on the boundary of a simply connected domain in @xmath45 .",
    "let us start with the definition when the domain is the upper half plane and the hulls grow from the origin to the point at infinity .",
    "a hull in the upper half plane @xmath47 is a bounded subset @xmath48 such that @xmath49 is open , connected and simply connected .",
    "the local growth of a family of hulls @xmath50 parameterized by @xmath51 with @xmath52 is related to complex analysis as follows . by the riemann mapping theorem , @xmath53 , the complement of @xmath50 in @xmath54 , which is simply connected by hypothesis , is conformally equivalent to @xmath54 via a map @xmath55 . this map can be normalized to behave as @xmath56 , using the @xmath57 automorphism group of @xmath54 and an appropriate time parameterization .",
    "the crucial condition of _ local _ growth leads to the loewner differential equation @xmath58 with @xmath15 a real function . for fixed @xmath59 , @xmath60 is well - defined up to the time @xmath61 for which @xmath62 .",
    "chordal stochastic loewner evolution is obtained @xcite by choosing @xmath63 with @xmath64 a normalized brownian motion and @xmath65 a real positive parameter so that @xmath66=\\kappa\\,{\\rm min}(t , s)$ ] .",
    "the sle hull is reconstructed from @xmath55 by @xmath67 and the sle trace @xmath68}$ ] by @xmath69 .",
    "basic properties of the sle hulls and sle traces are described in @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath68}$ ] is almost surely a curve .",
    "it is non - self intersecting and it coincides with @xmath50 for @xmath70 , while for @xmath71 it possesses double - points and it does not coincide with @xmath50 . for @xmath72 it is space filling .",
    "the normalization at infinity ensures that ( almost surely ) @xmath73 when @xmath74 .    to make contact with stochastic differential equations and conformal covariance , it is useful to define @xmath75 which satisfies @xmath76    according to our previous discussion , @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "the first vector field is holomorphic in @xmath54 and tangent to the boundary , so that by the schwarz reflection principle it extends automatically to a holomorphic vector field in the full complex plane .",
    "the second one is holomorphic in @xmath54 and tangent to the boundary except at the origin . for the same reason it extends automatically to a holomorphic vector field in the complex plane with the origin removed ; the extension has a simple pole with residue @xmath79 as its sole singularity .",
    "both @xmath40 and @xmath41 vanish at infinity , a double and triple zero respectively , which accounts for the fact that @xmath80 at infinity .",
    "they have no other common zero , which is the geometric reason why the sle trace goes to infinity at large @xmath28 .",
    "the germ of @xmath20 at infinity belongs to the group @xmath81 of germs of holomorphic functions at @xmath82 of the form @xmath83 ( with real coefficients ) .",
    "the group @xmath81 ( anti)acts by composition on @xmath84 , the space of germs of holomorphic functions at @xmath82 fixing @xmath82 .",
    "in particular , to @xmath20 we can associate @xmath85 , which satisfies eq.([slecov ] ) i.e. explicitly @xmath86    we shall see later that physically meaningful representations of the virasoro algebra can be turned into representations of @xmath81 .",
    "this is closely related to the fact that the lie algebra generated by @xmath87 and @xmath88 is isomorphic to the negative ( locally ) nilpotent sub - algebra of the virasoro algebra .",
    "if one thinks in terms of singularities , the most general holomorphic vector field in @xmath54 vanishing at infinity and tangent to the boundary is a linear combination of @xmath89 and @xmath90 . similarly , the most general holomorphic vector field in @xmath54 vanishing at infinity and tangent to the boundary but at the origin , where it has a simple pole of residue @xmath79 , is @xmath91 modulo a linear combination of @xmath89 and @xmath92 .",
    "imposing left - right symmetry leads to @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the @xmath92 contribution can be eliminated by a rescaling of @xmath20 and a deterministic time change preserving the brownian character of @xmath15 .",
    "note that to define brownian motion along a curve , one needs a parameterization .",
    "the fact that @xmath89 is the infinitesimal generator of a one parameter group of conformal automorphisms of @xmath54 that extend to the boundary can be viewed as providing such a parameterization .",
    "here are again some remarks on conformal covariance .",
    "if @xmath5 is a general simply connected domain ( possibly with some regularity conditions for the boundary ) with two marked points @xmath95 and @xmath96 on the boundary , the riemann mapping theorem can be applied to map the complement of a hull in @xmath5 to @xmath5 itself just as before .",
    "let @xmath0 be the conformal transformation , well defined up to an irrelevant dilation in @xmath54 , that maps @xmath54 to @xmath5 , @xmath97 to @xmath95 and @xmath82 to @xmath96 .",
    "the uniformizing map for the hull @xmath98 in @xmath5 is @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the uniformizing map for the hull @xmath101 in @xmath54 .",
    "the loewner equation for growing hulls in @xmath5 , say in the normalization when the tip of the hull is always mapped to @xmath95 , then follows by transport .",
    "one can reformulate this as follows .",
    "consider the abstract riemann surface @xmath3 with two marked boundary points which is the equivalence class of all open subsets @xmath5 of @xmath45 conformally equivalent to @xmath54 with @xmath95 and @xmath102 mapped to @xmath97 and @xmath82 .",
    "the above discussion means that the loewner equation and the loewner hulls are intrinsic geometric objects on @xmath3 . from the point of view of probabilities , this is not really a big constraint : once a probability measure on hulls in @xmath54 is defined , one can always transport it to the other non empty simply connected open sets in @xmath45 .",
    "it is plain that the transported measure is also related to loewner uniformization when the one in @xmath54 is .",
    "what is highly nontrivial is that continuum limits of discrete 2d critical statistical mechanics models are conformally covariant .",
    "such models are usually defined on a lattice , say @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a unit of length .",
    "criticality is the statement that when @xmath105 goes to zero certain nontrivial physical observables survive and do not depend on any scale .",
    "the limit has to be defined carefully .",
    "if @xmath5 and @xmath10 are two conformally equivalent open subsets of @xmath45 , related by a conformal map @xmath0 , one can consider the model in the intersection of the lattice @xmath103 with @xmath5 or @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath105 goes to @xmath97 , scale invariance does not a priori imply that the limit theories on @xmath5 and @xmath10 are related in a simple way .",
    "based on heuristic arguments of locality , it was conjectured in @xcite about twenty years ago , using another language , that the limiting theory is well defined on the abstract riemann surface which is the equivalence class of all open subsets of @xmath45 conformally equivalent to @xmath5 .",
    "for instance ,",
    "as recalled in section [ sec : conftrans ] , correlation functions of local observables become sections of appropriate bundles , i.e. have transformations that involve derivatives of @xmath0 when going from @xmath5 to @xmath10 .",
    "interfaces are directly related by @xmath0 and the probability law governing their fluctuations as well .",
    "so sle hulls behave geometrically as they should to encode the statistics of critical interfaces .",
    "however , sle does it in a very specific way , involving loewner evolution and @xmath106 brownian motion . even if , as we shall recall in section [ sec : cftchorsle ]",
    ", there is a simple and elegant direct relation between sle and cft , we have no rigorous understanding why the fluctuations of critical interfaces are so closely related to the markov property and the continuity which characterize brownian motion .",
    "at least intuitively , conformal invariance is related to the markov property of sle conformal maps and the fact that interfaces are not supposed to branch is related to continuity .",
    "we end this section with a caveat . the above statement , that sle is conformally covariant under domain change ,",
    "should not be confused with the , _ incorrect in general _",
    ", statement that sle growth processes are conformally invariant in the sense @xmath107 brownian motion is conformally invariant . a local conformal transformation maps brownian motion to brownian motion modulo a random time change .",
    "but the classical locality computation , see e.g. ref.@xcite , shows that sle is conformally invariant in that sense only for @xmath108 , which corresponds to percolation , for which the central charge and the conformal weight to be introduced later both vanish .",
    "radial sle @xcite describes the growth of a hull from a point on the boundary of a simply connected domain @xmath1 in the complex plane to a point inside @xmath1 .",
    "conformal covariance and conformal automorphisms allow to choose @xmath54 as @xmath1 , @xmath97 as the boundary point where the sle trace emerges and @xmath109 as the inside point where the sle trace converges . in terms of geometry of vector fields ,",
    "we can still use holomorphicity , the schwarz symmetry principle and left - right symmetry , and impose that @xmath110 has after extension a simple pole at the origin with residue @xmath79 ( this is just a choice of time scale , the crucial point is that it has positive residue ) , and that @xmath40 is holomorphic .",
    "the sole difference is that this time the vector fields have to vanish at @xmath109 , where the sle trace converges .",
    "this gives two real conditions , so the situation is more rigid than in the chordal case .",
    "one finds @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "the choice of the proportionality factor is just a normalization of @xmath65 . for the space @xmath29",
    "we choose this time the germs of holomorphic functions at @xmath109 fixing @xmath109 and @xmath30 is the subspace of @xmath29 made of the germs with non vanishing derivative at @xmath109 .",
    "eq.([slecov ] ) reads explicitly @xmath113 observe that this time we do not use translations but another one parameter subgroup of the group of conformal automorphisms of @xmath54 , namely the ones fixing @xmath109 , to parameterize the real axis and define brownian motion .",
    "contact with conformal field theory is via the equalities @xmath114 notice that @xmath115 so that the ordinary differential equation governing radial sle in @xmath54 is @xmath116    the more traditional presentation of radial sle has the unit disk @xmath117 as @xmath1 , @xmath118 as the boundary point where the sle trace emerges and @xmath97 as the inside point where the sle trace converges .",
    "the disk variable is @xmath119 .",
    "the vector field @xmath120 generates rigid rotations .",
    "rescaling things to eliminate the unesthetic factor of @xmath79 , one retrieves the standard radial stochastic loewner equation . with this normalization",
    ", one finds @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "notice for further use that for a holomorphic vector field @xmath123 in the unit disk tangent at the boundary , the schwarz symmetry principle reads @xmath124 , which is of course satisfied by @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "if one realizes that radial sle is closely linked to a compact cartan torus of @xmath125 , related to rigid rotations of the disk , it is tempting to look at what we call dipolar sle , obtained by replacing rotations by a non compact cartan torus of @xmath125 . this amounts to replace the complex fixed point @xmath109 by the pair of real fixed points @xmath118 and @xmath126 and leads to @xmath127 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , one has two natural choices : germs of holomorphic functions at @xmath128 fixing @xmath128 .",
    "one can check that the corresponding ordinary differential equation , @xmath129 is the loewner equation when the loewner map is normalized to fix @xmath118 and @xmath126 and have the same derivative at these two points : @xmath130 .",
    "the simple time independent case , obtained by replacing the brownian @xmath15 by a constant @xmath131 , can be solved explicitly . for @xmath132",
    "the solution is @xmath133 and the sle trace is @xmath134 which swallows the positive imaginary axis . for general @xmath131 , @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the conformal transformation fixing @xmath137 and mapping @xmath97 to @xmath138 .",
    "the trace is the semi circle starting at @xmath138 and ending at @xmath139 .",
    "the vector field @xmath140 vanishes at three points , @xmath128 and @xmath139 and has a simple pole at @xmath138 . for positive @xmath131",
    ", it looks as in figure [ fig : dipolar ] .",
    "the fixed points @xmath128 are attractive , but @xmath139 is repulsive .",
    "the structure of the vector field at the pole illustrates the square root singularity of the loewner map at the tip of the trace .",
    "the trace is the unstable curve , joining the pole to the repulsive fixed point , that separates the basins of attraction of @xmath118 and @xmath126 .",
    "it takes an infinite time to reach its end point .",
    "let us return to the case when @xmath15 is a brownian motion .",
    "since the complement @xmath141 of @xmath142 - 1,1[$ ] in @xmath143 is invariant under the sle map , a simple property is that the hull can not hit @xmath141 .",
    "a rough argument goes as follows .",
    "assume the contrary . by continuity ,",
    "before the hull hits @xmath141 , it has to leave the half disk @xmath144 .",
    "the probability @xmath145 that this happens before time @xmath28 is @xmath146 for every @xmath28 and increases with @xmath28 . the probability @xmath147 that the hull hits @xmath141 before time @xmath28 has the same properties .",
    "now , the time when the hull leaves the half disk @xmath144 is a stopping time , say @xmath148 . for @xmath149",
    ", @xmath150 is a new sle process , starting from @xmath97 .",
    "as @xmath141 is invariant under the time evolution , the original process hits @xmath141 only if the new one does .",
    "independence yields @xmath151 from which we deduce that @xmath152 because @xmath153 .",
    "together with the static picture , this leads to the following qualitative picture for dipolar sle traces .",
    "the brownian motion will oscillate indefinitely , little by little covering the whole real line . as @xmath154 approaches @xmath128 exponentially fast for large @xmath15 , a plausible scenario is that most of the time the sle trace will move towards points close to @xmath128 , hesitating alternatively between the two points , but never swallowing @xmath137 .",
    "dipolar sle certainly deserves a rigorous investigation .",
    "there is yet another geometry with all the useful properties used in the above examples , namely the possibility to apply the schwarz symmetry principle , left - right symmetry and a one parameter group of automorphisms .",
    "the geometry is that of an annulus .",
    "one new feature is the existence of moduli .",
    "this case was treated from another viewpoint by @xcite .",
    "the case of percolation @xmath108 has been investigated by @xcite .",
    "it is a classical theorem that any open domain in @xmath45 with the topology of an annulus is conformally equivalent to an open annulus @xmath155 for some unique @xmath1560,\\infty[$ ] .",
    "the automorphism group of @xmath157 is generated by rigid rotations and the discrete symmetry @xmath158 which exchanges the boundary components .",
