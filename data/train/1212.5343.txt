    "the scaling factor ( the value of this cross section ratio ) , denoted as @xmath111 , is typically interpreted as a measure of the number of @xmath3-src pairs per nucleon in nucleus @xmath33 relative to @xmath112  @xcite .",

    "in this kinematic region we can assume that the electron scattering cross section from the nucleus is approximately equal to the incoherent sum of electron scattering from the constituent nucleons and therefore is proportional to the number of nucleons times the electron - nucleon cross section .",

    "[ eq:3 ] is reasonably accurate because there are about 20 times more @xmath75-src than @xmath76- or @xmath121-src pairs ( @xmath124 )  @xcite . if we use the measured value of @xmath125 @xcite and assume that @xmath126 , then eq .  [ eq:3 ] is valid to about 5% ."

    "<S> nuclear transparency , @xmath0 , is a measure of the average probability for a struck proton to escape the nucleus without significant re - interaction . </S>",
    "<S> previously , nuclear transparencies were extracted for quasi - elastic @xmath1 knockout of protons with momentum below the fermi momentum , where the spectral functions are well known . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we extract a novel observable , the transparency ratio , @xmath2 , for knockout of high - missing - momentum protons from the breakup of short range correlated pairs ( @xmath3-src ) in @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 nuclei relative to @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratios were measured at momentum transfer @xmath8 ( gev / c)@xmath9 and @xmath10 where the reaction is expected to be dominated by electron scattering from @xmath3-src . </S>",
    "<S> the transparency ratios of the knocked - out protons coming from @xmath3-src breakup are @xmath11 lower than those of previous results for low missing momentum . </S>",
    "<S> they agree with glauber calculations and agree with renormalization of the previously published transparencies as proposed by recent theoretical investigations . </S>",
    "<S> the new transparencies scale as @xmath12 , which is consistent with dominance of scattering from nucleons at the nuclear surface .    </S>",
    "<S> nuclear transparency , @xmath13 , is defined as the ratio of the cross section per nucleon for a process on a bound nucleon in the nucleus to that from a free nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> conventionally , for protons , @xmath0 has been extracted as the ratio of the measured @xmath1 quasi - elastic ( qe ) cross section to the calculated plane - wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) cross section , which does not include final state interactions ( fsi ) . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental cross sections are typically integrated over proton missing momenta below the fermi momentum ( @xmath14 mev / c ) , and missing energy , @xmath15 , below 80 mev corresponding to knockout of mean - field protons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the momentum and energy transfer of the virtual photon and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the momentum and kinetic energy of the outgoing proton , respectively . ) for a recent review , see @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> two - nucleon short - range correlations ( 2n - src ) are pairs of nucleons with high momentum ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) that balance each other . </S>",
    "<S> the pair has high relative momentum ( @xmath24 ) and low center of mass momentum ( @xmath25 ) , where high and low is relative to the fermi momentum . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3-src consist mainly of neutron - proton pairs and dominate the tail ( @xmath26 ) of the nuclear momentum distribution for all nuclei  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the extraction of nuclear transparency from the @xmath1 quasi - elastic data , the @xmath3-src are an obstacle since they remove a fraction of the single - particle strength beyond the missing momentum and energy integration range . </S>",
    "<S> this removed strength is difficult to accurately ascertain and therefore introduces uncertainty to the absolute value of @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> the analysis was carried out as part of the jefferson lab hall b data - mining project  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> clas uses a toroidal magnetic field ( with electrons bending towards the beam line ) and six independent sets of drift chambers , time - of - flight ( tof ) scintillation counters , cherenkov counters ( cc ) , and electro - magnetic calorimeters ( ec ) for charged particle identification and trajectory reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> the polar angular acceptance is @xmath36 and the azimuthal angular acceptance is 50% at small polar angles , increasing to 80% at larger polar angles .    </S>",
    "<S> we identified electrons and rejected pions by requiring that negative particles produced more than 2.5 photo - electrons in the cherenkov counter . </S>",
    "<S> additional electron / pion separation was achieved by demanding a correlation between the energy deposited in the inner and outer parts of the ec divided by the momentum of the particle  @xcite . the total energy deposited by electrons in the calorimeter </S>",
    "<S> was closely correlated with the electron momentum over the full momentum range . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates the electrons are identified cleanly . </S>",
    "<S> we applied fiducial cuts on the angle and momentum of the electrons to avoid regions with steeply varying acceptance close to the magnetic coils of clas .    </S>",
    "<S> protons in clas were identified by requiring that the difference between the measured time - of - flight of positively charged particles and that calculated from their measured momentum and the proton mass be less than two standard deviations . </S>",
    "<S> this cut clearly separates protons from pions / kaons up to @xmath37 gev / c . due to statistical limitations </S>",

    "<S> the vertex reconstruction resolution for both electrons and protons was sufficient to unambiguously separate particles originating in the cryotarget and the solid target .    </S>",
    "<S> cross section ratios for scattering off the solid targets are defined as the yield ratio , normalised according to the number of scatterers in the target and the integrated luminosity accumulated for each target during the experiment . because all solid targets were located at the same location along the beam line and because the @xmath1 missing energy and missing momentum distributions for the different targets were similar , the detector acceptance effects on the ratios of yields from different solid targets are negligible in comparison to our statistical and other systematics uncertainties .     </S>",

[ tab : cuts ]    the cut on @xmath61 is lower than used in inclusive scattering , but the additional cut on @xmath62 ensures the selection of events dominated by scattering off @xmath3-src pairs , as shown by previous experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cut on @xmath56 suppresses the contribution of @xmath63 excitations and meson production . </S>",
    "<S> the cuts on @xmath64 and @xmath58 select the struck leading proton ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : leadingproton ] ) . at most one proton per event passed these cuts , even for events with more than one detected proton . </S>",
    "<S> these cuts combined with the clas acceptance result in a momentum transfer distribution that ranges from approximately @xmath65 to @xmath66 ( gev / c)@xmath9 ( see fig .  [ fig : q2 ] ) .        at these kinematics ( @xmath67 ( gev / c)@xmath9 , @xmath68 , and missing momentum @xmath69 mev / c ) the nucleon momentum distribution for any given nucleus scales as the number of @xmath3-src pairs in that nucleus times a common momentum distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation is strongly supported by both experimental @xcite and theoretical investigations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 cross section in the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) equals a kinematic factor times the elementary electron - proton elastic cross section times the probability of finding a proton at that missing energy and missing momentum . under these assumptions , </S>",
    "<S> the pwia cross section ratio for scattering off high - momentum protons from two different nuclei will equal the ratio of the number of @xmath70-src pairs in the two nuclei ( since the other factors all cancel in the ratio ) . since the pwia cross section does not include the effects of nucleon rescattering as they exit the nucleus , we therefore define the proton transparency ratio of any two nuclei in this kinematical regime as the ratio of their measured cross sections scaled by the product of the number of @xmath70-src pairs : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the measured quasi - elastic scattering cross section for nucleus @xmath33 , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the average number of @xmath75 and @xmath76 src pairs in nucleus @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> ( the factor of 2 multiplying @xmath74 reflects the fact that the electron can scatter from either proton in a @xmath76 pair . )    under minimal assumptions ( see appendix for details ) , this simplifies to @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the relative number of @xmath3-src pairs per nucleon in nuclei @xmath79 and @xmath80 . </S>",

    "<S> these ratios are 2030% lower than the corresponding published ratios for mean - field protons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical studies  @xcite claim that the published mean - field proton transparencies are too high because the pwia calculations incorrectly included a correction factor that overestimated the effect of @xmath3-src and therefore underestimated the number of available mean - field protons . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , where @xmath105 is the nuclear radius , indicating that the reaction is dominated by scattering off the nuclear surface .    in summary , we measured semi - inclusive @xmath1 cross section ratios for @xmath43al , @xmath44fe and @xmath45pb nuclei relative to @xmath42c at @xmath8 gev / c@xmath106 , @xmath10 and @xmath107 mev / c where knockout of protons from @xmath3-src should dominate . </S>",
    "<S> we used these cross section ratios to extract the transparency ratios for protons from the @xmath3-src breakup . </S>",
    "<S> the proton transparency ratios are independent of proton momentum and are @xmath108 lower than the transparency ratios of mean - field proton knockout . </S>",
    "<S> this difference is consistent with the proposed renormalisation of the mean - field transparencies to properly account for the effects of correlated nucleons  @xcite . </S>",
