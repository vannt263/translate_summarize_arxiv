    "the excited nucleons are unstable and coupled with the meson - nucleon continuum to form nucleon resonances ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "thus the properties of the excited nucleons can only be studied by analyzing the nucleon resonances extracted from the data of meson production reactions induced by pions , photons and electrons .",
    "the extraction of nucleon resonances has a long history . in recent years",
    ", the main advance is to develop multi - channel approaches to extract nucleon resonances by fitting @xmath6 the data of @xmath7 , where the @xmath8 states contain resonance components @xmath9 .",
    "it has been observed in ref.@xcite that three such multi - channel analyses@xcite agree well for the @xmath5 states with energies below about 1.6 gev , but disagree very significantly at higher energies . in the first part of this contribution",
    ", we use several exactly soluble @xmath0 scattering models to investigate the sources of these differences and discuss how a dynamical approach used in the anl - osaka@xcite analysis can help reduce the uncertainties in extracting the nucleon resonances .",
    "in addition to extracting the nucleon resonances , the main outcome of the anl - osaka analysis is a multi - channel model hamiltonian which can be used to interpret the extracted resonance parameters and to make predictions for future experimental tests . in this contribution",
    ", we further demonstrate that the anl - osaka multi - channel hamiltonian can be used to relate the spectrum from the lqcd calculations to the nucleon resonances embedded in the experimental data of @xmath1 reactions .",
    "this is achieved by applying the finite - volume hamiltonian method developed in refs.@xcite .",
    "the results from examining the model dependence of the resonance extraction are presented in section 2 .",
    "the applications of the finite - volume hamiltonian method to predict spectra from the anl - osaka model hamiltonians will be presented in section 3 . a summary and the discussions on future directions",
    "are given in section 4 .",
    "it has been well established@xcite that resonances are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian of the underlying fundamental theory with outgoing boundary condition and are associated with the poles of the scattering amplitudes in the complex energy(@xmath10)-plane .",
    "the extraction of resonances consists of two steps :    1 .",
    "determine the partial - wave amplitudes ( pwa ) from the available data .",
    "2 .   analytically continue the determined pwa to the complex - e plane for extracting the poles and residues that are near the physical region .    for the step 1 , it has been shown@xcite that the partial - wave amplitudes can be determined up to an overall phase from the independent observables obtained by performing @xmath11 experiments . for example , for determining the pwa of the single pseudo - scalar meson photo - production we need@xcite to have data for the differential cross sections ( @xmath12 ) , single polarizations ( @xmath13 ) , and double polarizations ( @xmath14 with linearly polarized photons and @xmath15 with circularly polarized photons .",
    "the measurements should cover all angles at each energy and have high accuracy .    in reality ,",
    "complete experiments are not available and hence the data for determining pwa are always incomplete and have large statistical and systematic errors in some angles or energies .",
    "even the data are complete , many solutions in the determinations of pwa are possible , mainly due to the intrinsic difficulty that the cross sections are related to the amplitudes bi - linearly ; i.e. @xmath16 .",
    "this was demonstrated in a study of the data of @xmath17 from jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) .",
    "the details have been presented in ref.@xcite , and will not be covered here .",
    "similar difficulties are also encountered in the determinations of the partial - wave amplitudes of @xmath0 , and @xmath1 scattering which will be discussed in this contribution .",
    "once the pwa are determined , we then take step 2 to analytically continue the pwa to the complex - e plane .",
    "this can only be done within a model and thus the model dependence of resonance extraction is an important issue . in this section",
    ", we use several exactly soluble @xmath0 scattering models to illustrate this intrinsic difficulty of the resonance extraction .    following the coupled - channel hamiltonian formulation of ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that @xmath0 scattering can be described by vertex interactions @xmath18 , which define the decay of the @xmath19-th bare state @xmath20 into a two - particle state @xmath21 , and two - body potentials @xmath22 , where @xmath23 . in each partial wave , the scattering amplitude is then defined by the following coupled - channel equations @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the mass of the @xmath19-th bare particle .",
    "to proceed , we need to choose the forms of the interactions in eq.([eq : lseq-2 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath28 vertex functions are defined as : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the mass of @xmath31 .",
    "the two - particle potentials are assumed to take the following separable form @xmath32 we will use various models to extract the resonance parameters .",
    "their differences are in the form of the form factors , the number of the bare states @xmath33 , and the number of terms in the separable potentials . for form factors , we consider the following three parametrizations : @xmath34 we consider three models :    1 .   model i - a :",
    "the parametrization a is used and @xmath35 is set to define the potential eq.([eq : sepa - v ] ) .",
    "model i - b : the parametrization b is used and @xmath36 is set to define the potential eq.([eq : sepa - v ] ) .",
    "model i - c : the parametrization c is used and @xmath36 is set to define the potential eq.([eq : sepa - v ] ) .",
    "we first adjust the parameters of model i - a to roughly fit the data of @xmath0 amplitudes up to about 1 gev .",
    "this model is then used to generate the amplitudes as data in the fits by using the other two models .",
    "we assign extremely small error 1 @xmath37 in the fits . thus the resulting three amplitudes are almost indistinguishable , as seen in fig.[fg : ibc ] .",
    "their pole positions and residues are compared in table [ tab : iabc ] .",
    "we see that three models agree extremely well except the residue for @xmath38 channel of the first resonance near @xmath39 mev which is well below the threshold @xmath40 mev of the @xmath38 threshold . apart from this ,",
    "we conclude that the extraction of resonance parameters are independent of the form of the form factors as far as the data are fitted @xmath41 .",
    "the small differences seen in table [ tab : iabc ] are due to the remaining small discrepancies between the three models in their resulting amplitudes .",
    "our results also suggest that the residues of a given channel for the resonance poles which are well below the threshold of that channel are not meaningful .",

    "the results discussed in section ii indicate that in reality the determination of pwa and resonance extraction can not be performed model independently .",
    "it is desirable to investigate nucleon resonances within a reaction model that is constrained by the well - established physics .",
    "thus the meson - exchange mechanisms , which have been well established in the studies of @xmath44 scattering@xcite and @xmath1 and @xmath45 reactions in the @xmath46 ( 1232 ) region@xcite , are used to define the analytic structure of the non - resonant reaction amplitudes in the anl - osaka analysis .",
    "the results of the anl - osaka analysis have been given in detail in ref.@xcite and will not be covered here .",
    "instead , we now turn to explaining how the finite - volume hamiltonian method developed in refs.@xcite can be applied to relate the anl - osaka model hamiltonian to the lqcd calculations .    in a periodic volume characterized by side length @xmath47 , the quantized three momenta of mesons and baryons",
    "must be @xmath48 for integers @xmath49 . for a given choice of momenta @xmath50 , solving the schrodinger equation @xmath51 in finite volume",
    "is equivalent to finding the eigenvalues of the following matrix equations @xmath52 _ { n_c+1 } + [ h_i]_{n_c+1 } - e[i ] _ { n_c+1 } ) = 0\\ , , \\label{eq : det-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 with @xmath54 denoting the number of channels , @xmath55_{n_c+1}$ ] is an @xmath56 unit matrix .",
    "the essence of the finite - volume hamiltonian method is that the scattering amplitudes calculated from the predicted spectrum by using the lscher formula@xcite are identical to the scattering amplitudes calculated directly from the hamiltonian in infinite volume .",
    "it follows that the spectrum from solving eq.([eq : det-1 ] ) at any @xmath47 can be used as the `` data '' to test the lqcd calculation at the same @xmath47 , since the information of the nucleon resonances embedded in the data have been coded in the constructed hamiltonian .",
    "no need to perform expensive lqcd calculations covering a wide range of @xmath47 for investigating the nucleon resonances , such as the roper @xmath57 resonance , which decay into multi - channel states .",
    "the finite - volume hamiltonian method was established in ref.@xcite using a simple one - channel ( @xmath58 ) hamiltonian consisting of a @xmath59 vertex and a separable @xmath60 separable potential . here",
    "we confirm the method by using the meson - exchange model ( sl model ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fg : sl ] .",
    "the predicted energy levels as function of the volume size @xmath47 are shown in the left - hand side , and the solid curve in the right - hand side is drawn from using the phase shifts calculated from the sl model in infinite volume . for each energy @xmath10 at a given @xmath47 in the left - hand side , the lscher formula can be used to get the phase shift @xmath61 by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is evaluated by the momentum @xmath64 defined by @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is the generalized zeta function .",
    "the phases calculated from each energy at @xmath67 in the left - hand side of fig.[fg : sl ] are the points in the right - hand side , which agree with the solid curve .",
    "thus the finite - volume hamiltonian method is equivalent to the use of lscher formula to relate the spectrum of finite volume to the scattering amplitudes which are obtained from fitting the experimental data through the sl model hamiltonian .",
    "the lscher s formula for the cases with two open channels , such as that derived in ref.@xcite , can be written as @xmath68 \\quad-\\eta\\cos\\left[\\phi(q_1(l))-\\phi(q_{2}(l))-\\delta_{1}+\\delta_{2}\\right]=0\\ , , \\label{eq : luch2a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 with @xmath70 , @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is the phase shifte for channel 1 ( 2 ) , and @xmath73 is the inelasticity . in the rest frame",
    ", this means that we need to perform calculations for three different values of @xmath47 if eq.([eq : luch2a ] ) is used to test lqcd results against the data of two phase shifts and inelasicity . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectrum from finite - volume hamiltonian method at only one @xmath47 is sufficient to test lqcd calculations at the same @xmath47 since the resonances embedded in the data have been coded in the hamiltonian .",
    "alternatively , one can use the lqcd spectrum to construct a k - matrix model , such as that done in ref.@xcite , and then look for the resonance poles . from the results discussed in the previous section ,",
    "it is clear that such an approach will be reliable only when the predicted phase shifts and inelasticity are of high accuracy and cover a sufficiently wide range of energies such that the parameters of the k - matrix are well conatrained .",
    "thus the lqcd calculations for a wide range of @xmath47 are required . here",
    "we see the advantage of using the finite volume hamiltonian method over the use of lscher formula to test lqcd calculations .",
    "the anl - osaka model hamiltonian can be schematically written as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the free hamiltonian and the interaction hamiltonian can be written as @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 defines the decay of the @xmath19-th bare @xmath5 state into channel @xmath21 , @xmath22 denotes the meson - exchange potential between channels @xmath21 and @xmath79 , and @xmath80 describes the decay of meson @xmath81 into @xmath0 .",
    "the interactions are determined by fitting very extensive data of @xmath82 processes and the nucleon resonances have been extracted .",
    "thus , a lqcd calculation can be related to the nucleon resonances embedded in the @xmath1 and @xmath45 reactions if its predicted spectrum agree with the spectrum calculated from the anl - osaka model hamiltonian by solving eq.([eq : det-1 ] ) in finite volume .    in the presence of the transitions to @xmath8 states due to",
    "the @xmath83 and @xmath84 vertex interactions in eq.([eq : anl - osaka - h ] ) , it is rather complex to apply the finite - volume hamiltonian method to the anl - osaka hamiltonian . to compare our approach with the approach using the lscher formula ,",
    "it is sufficient to consider a three - channel hamiltonian which is deduced from eq.([eq : anl - osaka - h ] ) by keeping only @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 channels and neglecting the @xmath85 and @xmath86 vertex interactions .",
    "we determine this three - channel model hamiltonian by fitting the @xmath1 scattering amplitudes up to only @xmath87 gev . except the @xmath88 partial wave , which is known to have large coupling with the @xmath89 channel and therefore",
    "can not be fitted well here , the fits are comparable to those of the anl - osaka results .",
    "the extracted resonance poles are with masses @xmath90 mev for @xmath91 and @xmath92 mev for @xmath93 .",
    "the value for @xmath93 is close to the @xmath94 mev of sl model@xcite .",
    "this is consistent with what we have shown in the previous section , since the constructed 3-channel model and the sl model give almost the same fits to @xmath93 amplitude data below 1.3 gev .    for our discussion here",
    ", we show in fig.[fg : amp - p11 ] the resulting amplitudes for the @xmath95 transitions in the @xmath91 partial wave .",
    "these three amplitudes contain the information determined by the data of @xmath96 reactions .",
    "thus a lqcd calculation aimed at investigating the roper @xmath57 should at least be consistent with these three amplitudes , since it is known that the decay width for @xmath97 is very large",
    ". this can only be achieved by using either the multi - channel lscher formula@xcite or the finite - volume hamiltonian method .",
    "we now turn to comparing these two different approaches within the three - channel model described above .    for the three - channel model with @xmath98 , the matrix for the free hamiltonian in eq.([eq : det-1 ] )",
