    "in his famous letter to leonhard euler dated 7 june 1742 @xcite , christian goldbach stated his famous conjecture that `` every integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of three primes '' , statement that is equivalent to that every even number is a sum of two primes , as euler stated in the letter dated 30 june 1742 ( i regard this as a completely certain theorem , although i can not prove it ) .",
    "this strong goldbach conjecture implies the conjecture that all odd numbers greater than 7 are the sum of three odd primes , which is known today variously as the `` weak '' goldbach conjecture , the `` odd '' goldbach conjecture , or the `` ternary '' goldbach conjecture .    in 1923",
    "the ternary conjecture has been proved under the assumption of the truth of the generalized riemann hypothesis @xcite , in 1937 vinogradov@xcite removed the dependence on the riemann hypothesis , and proved that this it true for all sufficiently large odd integers . in 1956 borodzkin showed that an integer greater than a large integer is sufficient in vinogradov s proof . in 1989 and 1996 chen and wang reduced this bound @xcite . using vinogradov s method , chudakov ,",
    "van der corput , and estermann @xcite showed that almost all even numbers can be written as the sum of two primes ( in the sense that the fraction of even numbers which can be so written tends towards 1 ) . in a very recent paper mathematician terence tao of the university of california , los angeles ,",
    "has inched toward a proof , in fact he has shown that one can write odd numbers as sums of , at most , five primes @xcite .",
    "although believed to be true , the binary goldbach conjecture is still lacking a proof .",
    "we state it as follows .",
    "[ s1 ] every even integer greater than 4 can be written as the sum of two primes .",
    "consider an even natural number @xmath0 , we can state the conjecture in term of the natural number @xmath1 as follows .",
    "[ s2 ] for every integer @xmath2 there exists a couple of odd prime numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 such that @xmath1 is their semi - sum , that is : @xmath5    this statement is equivalent to the original one considering that @xmath0 , with e a generic integer , is always an even natural , and that the original statement is trivially verified for the numbers 4 and 6 .",
    "[ d1 ] two prime numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with @xmath6 , are called mirror primes respect to an integer @xmath1 if there exists an integer @xmath7 such that : @xmath8 .",
    "so another equivalent statement to 2.1 , and of course to 1.1 , is :    [ s3 ] for every natural @xmath2 there exists a pair of mirror primes respect to @xmath1 .    in the following we will consider , without loss of generality , @xmath9 .",
    "the statement [ s3 ] , leads us to analyze when , given a natural number @xmath1 , there exists at least one integer @xmath7 defining two mirror primes respect to @xmath1 .",
    "first of all we have to ask if and when there exist such number @xmath7 ( if @xmath1 is prime the choice is trivially @xmath10 ) .",
    "moreover we are interested in an integer such that the two integers @xmath11 are primes ( observe that the primality can be checked by means of an efficient algorithm currently available @xcite ) .",
    "let observe that in the following we use that notation :    with the symbol @xmath12 we denote the number of primes less than or equal to @xmath13 .",
    "with the expression @xmath14 we state that @xmath15 is congruento to @xmath16 modulo @xmath17 .",
    "with the expression @xmath14 we state that @xmath15 is not congruento to @xmath16 modulo @xmath17 .    with the expression",
    "@xmath18 $ ] we indicate the interval open on left and close on right .    with the expression @xmath19 we denote that @xmath15 does nt divide @xmath16 .    with the exprression @xmath20",
    "we denote the cardinality of the set of elements @xmath21",
    ".    in some passages the symbol @xmath22 $ ] indicates the greatest integer less then or equal to @xmath13 , but in general the square brackets are used to group symbols in an expression .",
    "the aim of the article is to calculate the number @xmath7 such that the two integers @xmath11 were primes .",
    "we observe that if the number @xmath7 is such that it satisfies the @xmath23 relations @xmath24 this fact alone represents a sufficient condition for the desired result .",
    "therefore the results provided in the following sections can be summarized by these two logical steps :    \\1 . given an even natural number @xmath0 it will be provided a method in order to calculate an integer @xmath7 such that @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the @xmath23 primes less than or equal to @xmath27 . this assure that the two integers @xmath11 are prime numbers .",
    "this step depends on the choice of a set of positive integers @xmath28 and on the choice of their signs ( + /-",
    "it will be provided a method in order to calculate at least one set of integer @xmath28 such that @xmath29 , and considering that @xmath30 the consequence is that @xmath24 .",
    "this step , in combination with the step 1 , allow us to obtain the number @xmath7 greater than @xmath31 and less than @xmath1 .",
    "consequently we obtain a pair of mirror primes respect to @xmath1 , that is : @xmath32 .",
    "about the existence of prime numbers in the intervals definened by the number @xmath1 , that is : @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the following result holds .",
    "[ l1 ] given an arbitrary integer @xmath9 there is at least one prime number in the intervals @xmath33 and @xmath35 .    in the first interval",
    "we have trivially at least the first two primes . regarding the second interval ,",
    "actually it is the bertrand s postulate , also called the bertrand - chebyshev theorem or chebyshev s theorem : it states that if @xmath2 , there is always at least one prime @xmath36 between @xmath1 and @xmath37 @xcite.@xmath38    furthemore we can ask if there are particular relations among @xmath39 .",
    "we can easily observe that the mirror primes can not be prime factors neither of the natural number @xmath0 nor of @xmath7 .",
    "we summarize those remarks in the following lemma .",
    "[ l2 ] given @xmath1 , even integer number , for all pairs of mirror primes respect to @xmath1 it holds : @xmath40    we prove @xmath41 by reductio ad absurdum .",
    "we have : @xmath42 , and if @xmath43 then @xmath44 , but @xmath4 is prime and so it is impossible .",
    "the statement @xmath45 follows from the identity @xmath46 and from the fact that @xmath3 is by hypothesis prime .",
    "similarly the third statement follows from observing that @xmath47    remembering that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself , it is easily to infer that every composit number @xmath48 has a prime factor less than or equal to @xmath49 .",
    "in fact if @xmath48 has a prime factor less than or equal to its square root it is a composite number . conversely let suppose for simplicity that @xmath48",
    "could be written , according to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic @xcite , as the product of two primes @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "if both of these two numbers were greater than @xmath49 we should have that : @xmath50 , that is @xmath51 , and it is not possible .",
    "the underlying rationale can be generalized to an arbitrary number of prime factors .",
    "so at least one prime divisors of each of the two quantity @xmath11 , if composite , are in the interval @xmath52 $ ] . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath11 are not divisible by any prime less then or equal to @xmath53 then they can not be a composite integer , so it has to be prime .",
    "the following lemma introduces the calculation method for the number d depending on an arbitrary choice of suitable integers @xmath54 .",

    "tell us that the system has a solution congruent to @xmath60 .",
    "the solution can be calculated by the following formula : @xmath61 , where : @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is the inverse of @xmath64 , that is : @xmath65    let note that the right terms of several congruencies could be considered as negative integers , in this case the result of the lemma is still valid ( that is , supposing @xmath66 , we would have : @xmath67 for some @xmath68 $ ] , and the correspondent terms of the expession of the solution would be modified accordingly multiplying by @xmath69 ) .",
