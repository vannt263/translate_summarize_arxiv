    "during the last 30 years .",
    "physics of surfaces and objects of nanometric size have attracted an immense interest .",
    "this is due to important applications in industry.@xcite an example is the so - called giant magneto - resistance ( gmr ) used in data storage devices , magnetic sensors , ...",
    "@xcite in parallel to these experimental developments , much theoretical effort@xcite has also been devoted to the search of physical mechanisms lying behind new properties found in nanoscale objects such as ultrathin films , ultrafine particles , quantum dots , spintronic devices etc .",
    "this effort aimed not only at providing explanations for experimental observations but also at predicting new effects for future experiments .",
    "the physics of two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems is very exciting .",
    "some of those 2d systems can be exactly solved : one famous example is the ising model on the square lattice which has been solved by onsager.@xcite this model shows a phase transition at a finite temperature @xmath4 given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interaction . another interesting result is the absence of long - range ordering at finite temperatures for the continuous spin models ( xy and heisenberg models ) in 2d.@xcite in general , three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems for any spin models can not be unfortunately solved .",
    "however , several methods in the theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena can be used to calculate the critical behaviors of these systems.@xcite    this paper deals with systems between 2d and 3d .",
    "many theoretical studies have been devoted to thermodynamic properties of thin films , magnetic multilayers , ... @xcite in spite of this , several points are still not yet understood .",
    "we study here the critical behavior of thin films with a finite thickness .",
    "it is known a long time ago that the presence of a surface in magnetic materials can give rise to surface spin - waves which are localized in the vicinity of the surface.@xcite these localized modes may be acoustic with a low - lying energy or optical with a high energy , in the spin - wave spectrum .",
    "low - lying energy modes contribute to reduce in general surface magnetization at finite temperatures .",
    "one of the consequences is the surface disordering which may occur at a temperature lower than that for interior magnetization.@xcite the existence of low - lying surface modes depends on the lattice structure , the surface orientation , the surface parameters , surface conditions ( impurities , roughness , ... ) etc .",
    "there are two interesting cases : in the first case a surface transition occurs at a temperature distinct from that of the interior spins and in the second case the surface transition coincides with the interior one , i. e. existence of a single transition .",
    "theory of critical phenomena at surfaces@xcite and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations@xcite of critical behavior of the surface - layer magnetization at the extraordinary transition in the three - dimensional ising model have been carried out .",
    "these works suggested several scenarios in which the nature of the surface transition and the transition in thin films depends on many factors in particular on the symmetry of the hamiltonian and on surface parameters .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of the film thickness on the critical behavior of the system .",
    "we would like to see in particular how the thickness affects the values of critical exponents . to carry out these purposes",
    ", we shall use mc simulations with highly accurate multiple histogram technique.@xcite we consider here the case of a simple cubic film with ising model . for our purpose",
    ", we suppose all interactions are the same even that at the surface .",
    "this case is the simplest case where there is no surface - localized spin - wave modes and there is only a single phase transition at a temperature for the whole system ( no separate surface phase transition).@xcite other complicated cases will be left for future investigations .",
    "however , some preliminary discussions on this point for complicated surfaces have been reported in some of our previous papers.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to a description of the model and method .",
    "results are shown and discussed in section iii .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "let us consider the ising spin model on a film made from a ferromagnetic simple cubic lattice .",
    "the size of the film is @xmath7 .",
    "we apply the periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) in the @xmath8 planes to simulate an infinite @xmath8 dimension .",
    "the @xmath2 direction is limited by the film thickness @xmath9 . if @xmath10 then one has a 2d square lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ising spin of magnitude 1 occupying the lattice site @xmath13 , @xmath14 indicates the sum over the nn spin pairs @xmath12 and @xmath15 .    in the following ,",
    "the interaction between two nn surface spins is denoted by @xmath16 , while all other interactions are supposed to be ferromagnetic and all equal to @xmath17 for simplicity .",
    "let us note in passing that in the semi - infinite crystal the surface phase transition occurs at the bulk transition temperature when @xmath18 .",
    "this point is called `` extraordinary phase transition '' which is characterized by some particular critical exponents.@xcite in the case of thin films , i. e. @xmath9 is finite , it has been theoretically shown that when @xmath19 the bulk behavior is observed when the thickness becomes larger than a few dozens of atomic layers:@xcite surface effects are insignificant on thermodynamic properties such as the value of the critical temperature , the mean value of magnetization at a given @xmath20 , ... when @xmath16 is smaller than @xmath6 , surface magnetization is destroyed at a temperature lower than that for bulk spins.@xcite however , it should be stressed that , except at the so - called `` extraordinary phase transition'',@xcite the surface criticality has not been studied as a function of the film thickness .",
    "the multiple histogram technique is known to reproduce with very high accuracy the critical exponents of second order phase transitions.@xcite    the overall probability distribution@xcite at temperature @xmath20 obtained from @xmath21 independent simulations , each with @xmath22 configurations , is given by @xmath23}{\\sum_{j=1}^n n_j\\exp[e / k_bt_j - f_j ] } , \\label{eq : mhp}\\ ] ] where @xmath24=\\sum_{e}p(e , t_i ) .",

    "the @xmath8 linear sizes @xmath28 have been used in our simulations .",
    "we have tested that all exponents do not change in the finite size scaling with @xmath29 .",
    "so most of results are shown for @xmath29 except for @xmath0 where the lowest sizes @xmath30 can be used without modifying its value .    in practice , we use first the standard mc simulations to localize for each size the transition temperatures @xmath31 for specific heat and @xmath32 for susceptibility .",
    "the equilibrating time is from 200000 to 400000 mc steps / spin and the averaging time is from 500000 to 1000000 mc steps / spin .",
    "next , we make histograms at @xmath33 different temperatures @xmath34 around the transition temperatures @xmath35 with 2 millions mc steps / spin , after discarding 1 millions mc steps / spin for equilibrating . finally , we make again histograms at @xmath33 different temperatures around the new transition temperatures @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 mc steps / spin for equilibrating and averaging time , respectively .",
    "such an iteration procedure gives extremely good results for systems studied so far .",
    "errors shown in the following have been estimated using statistical errors , which are very small thanks to our multiple histogram procedure , and fitting errors given by fitting software .",
    "we have calculated the averaged order parameter @xmath38 ( @xmath39 : magnetization of the film ) , averaged total energy @xmath40 , specific heat @xmath41 , susceptibility @xmath42 , first order cumulant of the energy @xmath43 , and @xmath44 order cumulant of the order parameter @xmath45 for @xmath46 and 2 .",
    "these quantities are defined as    @xmath47    plotting these quantities as functions of @xmath20 for system size ( @xmath48 ) , we can identify the transition temperature by looking at their respective behavior ( maxima of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , ... ) .",
    "note that the transition temperatures for these quantities coincide only at infinite @xmath49 .",
    "for large values of @xmath49 , the following scaling relations are expected ( see details in ref . ):",

    "we estimate @xmath0 independently from @xmath60 and @xmath61 . with this value",
    "we calculate @xmath62 from @xmath63 and @xmath3 from @xmath64 .",
    "note that we can estimate @xmath65 by using the last expression . using @xmath65",
    ", we can calculate @xmath1 from @xmath66 .",
    "the rushbrooke scaling law @xmath67 is then in principle verified .",
    "finally , using the hyperscaling relationship , we can estimate the `` effective '' dimension of thin films by @xmath68 and the exponent @xmath69 from the scaling law @xmath70 .",
    "we note however that only @xmath0 is directly calculated from mc data .",
    "exponent @xmath62 obtained from @xmath63 and @xmath0 suffers little errors ( systematic errors and errors from @xmath0 ) .",
    "other exponents are obtained by mc data and several - step fitting .",
    "for example , to obtain @xmath3 we have to fit @xmath64 of eq .",
    "[ cv ] by choosing @xmath57 , @xmath58 and by using the value of @xmath0 .",
    "so in practice , in most cases , one calculates @xmath3 or @xmath1 from mc data and uses the rushbrooke scaling law to calculate the remaining exponent .",
    "however , for our precise purpose we will show in the following the results of all exponents @xmath0 , @xmath62 , @xmath3 and @xmath1 calculated from mc data .",
    "we will show that the rushbrooke scaling law is very well verified .",
    "the exponent @xmath3 will allow us to estimate the effective dimension of the system .",
    "we show now the results obtained by mc simulations with the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hamil1 ] ) .",
    "let us show in fig .",
    "[ fig : n24z5 m ] the layer magnetizations and their corresponding susceptibilities of the first three layers , in the case where @xmath19 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the surface layer is smaller that the interior layers , as it has been shown theoretically by the green s function method a long time ago.@xcite the surface spins have smaller local field due to the lack of neighbors , so thermal fluctuations will reduce their magnetization with respect to the interior layers .",
    "the susceptibilities have their peaks at the same temperature , indicating a single transition .    [",
    "figure [ fig : n24z5mt ] shows total magnetization of the film and the total susceptibility .",
    "this indicates clearly that there is only one peak as said above .",
    "let us show now an example of excellent results obtained from multiple histograms described above .",
    "figure [ fig : issvz11 ] shows the susceptibility and the first derivative @xmath71 versus @xmath20 around their maxima for several sizes .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : nul ] the maximum of the first derivative of @xmath72 with respect to @xmath73 versus @xmath74 in the @xmath75 scale for several film thicknesses up to @xmath76 . from the slopes of these remarkably straight lines ,",
    "we obtain @xmath77 .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuz ] @xmath0 as a function of thickness @xmath9 .",
    "we observe here a small but systematic deviation of @xmath0 from its 2d value ( @xmath78 with increasing thickness . to show the precision of our method , we give here the results of @xmath10 . for @xmath79",
    ", we have @xmath80 which yields @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : gaml ] and [ fig : gamz ] below ) yielding @xmath83 .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with the exact results @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the very high precision of our method is thus verified in the range of the system sizes used in the present work .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : gaml ] the maximum of the susceptibility versus @xmath49 in the @xmath75 scale for film thicknesses up to @xmath76 .",
    "we have used only results of @xmath29 . including @xmath86 and 25",
    "will result , unlike the case of @xmath0 , in a decrease of @xmath62 of about one percent for @xmath87 . from the slopes of these straight lines ,",
    "we obtain the values of @xmath88 . using the values of @xmath0 obtained above",
    ", we deduce the values of @xmath62 which are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamz ] as a function of thickness @xmath9 . unlike the case of @xmath0 , we observe here a stronger deviation of @xmath62 from its 2d value ( 1.75 ) with increasing thickness .",
    "this finding is somewhat interesting : the magnitude of the deviation from the 2d value may be different from one critical exponent to another : @xmath89 for @xmath0 and @xmath90 for @xmath62 when @xmath9 goes from 1 to 13 .",
    "we will see below that @xmath1 varies even more strongly .    at this stage ,",
    "a natural question arises : does the absence of pbc in the @xmath2 direction cause these deviations of the critical exponents ?",
    "the answer is no : we have calculated @xmath0 and @xmath62 for @xmath91 in both cases : with and without pbc in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "the results show no significant difference between the two cases as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : nuz5 ] and [ fig : gamz5 ] .",
    "we have found the same thing with @xmath92 shown in figs . [",
    "fig : nuz11 ] and [ fig : gamz11 ] .",
    "so , we conclude that the fixed thickness will result in the deviation of the critical exponents , not from the absence of the pbc .",
    "this is somewhat surprising since we thought , incorrectly , that the pbc should mimic the infinite dimension so that we should obtain the 3d behavior when applying the pbc .",
    "as will be seen below , the 3d behavior is recovered only when the finite size scaling is applied in the @xmath2 direction at the same time in the @xmath8 plane . to show this , we plot in figs .",
    "[ fig : nul3d ] and [ fig : gaml3d ] the results for the 3d case .",
    "even with our modest sizes ( up to @xmath93 , since it is not our purpose to treat the 3d case here ) , we obtain @xmath94 and @xmath95 very close to their 3d best known values @xmath96 and @xmath97 obtained by using @xmath98).@xcite",
    "let us discuss on the deviation of the critical exponents due to the film finite thickness",
    ". for second - order transitions , theoretical arguments , such as those from the renormalization group , say that the correlation length in the direction perpendicular to the film is finite , hence it is irrelevant to the criticality , the film should have the 2d character as long as @xmath9 is finite .",
    "we have seen above that this is not the case here .",
    "the deviation begins slowly as soon as @xmath9 departs from 1 .",
    "a possible cause for the deviation is from the spatially non uniform correlation : the correlation in a @xmath8 plane depends obviously on its position with respect to the surface layer . on and near the surface ,",
    "the spins suffer thermal fluctuations more strongly than the interior spins so there is no reason why all planes should have the same in - plane correlation behavior even when there is no separate surface transition as in the case @xmath19 studied here . due to this spatially",
    "non uniform fluctuations , we believe that near the phase transition , there are simultaneously several correlation lengths which give rise to a kind of `` effective '' critical exponents obtained above . loosely speaking , we can say in another manner that because of its spatial non uniformity , the correlation in the direction perpendicular to the film can not be separately summed up , it interacts with the @xmath8 correlation giving rise to `` effective '' critical exponents observed in our simulations . in other words ,",
    "the finite thickness makes the dimension of the system something between 2 and 3 . before showing this `` effective '' dimension",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphal ] the maximum of @xmath64 versus @xmath49 for @xmath99 .",
    "note that for each @xmath9 we had to look for @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath100 which give the best fit with data of @xmath64 . due to the fact that there are several parameters which can induce a wrong combination of them",
    ", we impose that @xmath3 should satisfied the condition @xmath101 where the lower limit of @xmath3 corresponds to the value of 2d case and the upper limit to the 3d case . in doing so",
    ", we get very good results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphal ] . from these ratios of @xmath100",
    "we deduce @xmath3 for each @xmath9 .",
    "the values of @xmath3 are shown in table [ tab : criexp ] for several @xmath9 .",
    "it is interesting to show now the effective dimension of thin film discussed above . replacing the values of @xmath3 obtained above in @xmath68",
    "we obtain @xmath102 shown in fig .",
    "[ de ] .",
    "we note that @xmath102 is very close to 2 .",
    "it varies from 2 to @xmath103 for @xmath9 going from 1 to 13 .",
    "the 2d character is thus dominant even with larger @xmath9 .",
    "this supports the idea that the finite correlation in the @xmath2 direction , though qualitatively causing a deviation , can not strongly alter the 2d critical behavior .",
    "this point is interesting because , as said earlier , some thermodynamic properties may show already their 3d values at a thickness of about a few dozens of layers , but not the critical behavior . to show an example of this ,",
    "let us plot in fig .",

    "we give the precise values of @xmath65 for each thickness . for @xmath10",
    ", we have @xmath108 from @xmath4 of specific heat and @xmath109 from @xmath4 of susceptibility . from these",
    "we have @xmath110 .",
    "note that the exact value of @xmath65 is 2.26919 by solving the equation @xmath111 .",
    "again here , the excellent agreement of our result shows the efficiency of the multiple histogram technique as applied in the present paper .",
    "the values of @xmath65 for other @xmath9 are summarized in table  [ tab : criexp ] .",
    "calculating now @xmath112 at these values of @xmath65 and using eq .",
    "[ mb ] , we obtain @xmath113 for each @xmath9 . for @xmath114 , we have @xmath115 which yields @xmath116 which is in excellent agreement with the exact result ( 0.125 ) .",
    "note that if we calculate @xmath1 from @xmath117 , then @xmath118 which is in good agreement with the direct calculation within errors .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ beta ] the values of @xmath1 obtained by direct calculation using eq .",
    "note that the deviation of @xmath1 from the 2d value when @xmath9 varies from 1 to 13 represents about 60@xmath119 .",
    "note that the 3d value of @xmath1 is @xmath120.@xcite    finally , for convenience , let us summarize our results in table [ tab : criexp ] for @xmath121 .",
    "due to the smallness of @xmath3 , its value is shown with 5 decimals without rounding .    [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have considered a simple system , namely the ising model on a simple cubic thin film , in order to clarify the point whether or not there is a continuous deviation of the 2d exponents with varying film thickness . from results obtained by the highly accurate multiple histogram technique shown above ,",
    "we conclude that the critical exponents in thin films show a continuous deviation from their 2d values as soon as the thickness departs from 1 .",
    "we believe that this deviation stems from deep physical mechanisms , not from the calculation method used here .",
    "we would like moreover to emphasize some additional interesting observations :    \\1 .",
    "the deviations of the exponents from their 2d values are very different in magnitude : while @xmath0 and @xmath3 vary very little over the studied range of thickness , @xmath62 and specially @xmath1 suffer stronger deviations      \\3 . to obtain the 3d behavior ,",
    "finite size scaling should be applied simultaneously in the three directions .",
    "if we do not apply the scaling in the @xmath2 direction , we will not obtain 3d behavior even with a very large , but fixed , thickness and even with periodic boundary condition in the @xmath2 direction    \\4 . with regard to the critical behavior ,",
    "thin films behave as systems with effective dimensions between 2 and 3 , depending on the film thickness .",
    "note however that , except a strong deviation of @xmath62 , other exponents stay near their 2d limit even with a large thickness , while non critical thermodynamic properties may attain 3d behaviors at a thickness of about a few dozens atomic layers .",
    "to conclude , we hope that the numerical results shown in this paper will stimulate more theoretical analysis in search for the origin of the continuous variation of the critical exponents with changing thickness .",
    "it should be also desirable to study more cases to clarify the role of thickness on the transition behavior of very thin films , in particular the effect of the film thickness on the bulk first - order transition .",
