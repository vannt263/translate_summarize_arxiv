    "it is somewhat disappointing that a meeting on `` galaxies and their constituents at the highest angular resolutions '' contains so few results from optical interferometry . to some extent , this reflects the interests of those on the scientific organising committee , but it must also be taken as a sign that optical interferometry has yet to deliver on its promises .",
    "why is this ?",
    "one reason is surely the difficultly of the technology and its vulnerability to hofstadter s law ( 1980 ) :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ hofstadter s law _  it always takes longer than you expect , even when you take into account hofstadter s law .",

    "the following is the current list of operating interferometers , listed in the order in which they obtained first fringes :    * gi2t / regain ( grand interfromtre  2 tlescopes ) .",
    "* susi ( sydney university stellar interferometer ) * coast ( cambridge optical aperture synthesis telescope ) * isi ( infrared spatial interferometer ) * fluor ( fiber linked unit for optical recombination ) * iota ( infrared - optical telescope array ) * npoi ( navy prototype optical interferometer ) * pti ( palomar testbed interferometer ) * chara ( center for high angular resolution astronomy )    the following are under construction ( in alphabetical order , since i am not game to predict which will be first to get fringes ! ) :    * keck interferometer * lbt ( large binocular telescope ) * mira - ii ( mitaka ir array ) * vlti ( very large telescope interferometer )    finally , there are planned space missions , including sim , tpf and darwin .    more details of all these projects can be found via links from the web - based `` optical long baseline interferometry news , '' currently maintained by peter lawson .",
    "here , i simply want to stress the number and range of the projects , and to point out that many of them are producing scientific results .",
    "the proceedings of recent conferences ( unwin & stachnik 1999 ; lena & quirrenbach 2000 ) testify to the vigorous activity in this field . in section  [ sec.recent ] , i highlight some areas in which recent technological developments have been made .",
    "first , however , it is appropriate to make some general remarks about optical interferometry .",
    "realising that interferometers measure fringes is the key to understanding their capabilities and limitations ( see , e.g. , bedding 1997 ; quirrenbach 1997 ) . to observe an object",
    ", an interferometer must be able to detect fringes and track them .",
    "this requires that the object has a sufficiently compact bright component , or that a suitable reference source ( e.g. , a star ) is located nearby on the sky .",
    "the main observable is the fringe contrast  the visibility  which is a dimensionless number between zero and one that indicates the extent to which a source is resolved on the baseline being used .",
    "importantly , the signal - to - noise with which the visibility can be measured is a function of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of photons detected per sub - aperture per integration time , and @xmath2 is the _ measured _ visibility ( including the inevitable reduction by atmospheric and instrumental effects ) .",
    "this dependence on @xmath0 implies that interferometry becomes increasingly difficult for faint sources , but also for those with complex structures .",
    "for example , a drop in visibility from 1 to 0.1 as a source becomes resolved is equivalent , in terms of signal - to - noise , to a drop in brightness by a factor of 100 ( 5 magnitudes ) !",
    "the @xmath0 limit can be addressed in several ways :    * using larger sub - apertures .",
    "however , this requires adaptive optics if the telescope diameter becomes much larger than  @xmath3 , the average scale over which the wavefront is flat . *",
    "bootstrapping to increase integration times , which can be achieved by tracking fringes over a connected series of short baselines to allow low - visibility fringes to be measured on the longest .",
    "this approach requires lots of telescopes , which must be deployed rather wastefully in terms of @xmath4 coverage . * tracking fringes on a point source to increase integration time on the target .",
    "this is best done with a dual - feed system .",
    "single - mode optical fibres have been used very successfully for spatially filtering light beams ( coude du  foresto et  al .",
    "this allows visibility amplitudes to be measured to high precision ( about one percent ) , by reducing the sensitivity to atmospheric fluctuations .",
    "so far , results have been demonstrated with iota in the @xmath5 band ( 2.2 micron ; perrin et  al .",
    "1999 ) and now in the @xmath6  band ( 3.75micron ; mennesson et  al .",
    "it seems clear that fibres have an important role to play in interferometry , especially in the infrared .",
    "a related development is in the field of integrated optics , which potentially allows large tables of bulk optics to be replaced by miniature devices .",
    "white - light interference has been achieved in the laboratory with two ( berger et  al .",
    "1999 ) and three beams ( haguenauer et  al .",
    "it is too soon to estimate the impact of this technology on optical interferometers , with applications in space perhaps being the most likely .",
    "the only interferometer operating in the mid - infrared is the isi , which has a heterodyne system .",
    "a recent development has been the application of isi to spectral - line observations of molecules around giant stars ( monnier et  al .",
    "both vlti and keck are targeting the mid - infrared , which is very attractive because the 810-m apertures are essentially diffraction - limited at 1020microns .",
    "a lot of excellent science can be expected from those instruments , provided the problems with thermal background can be overcome , but the amount of observing time will obviously be limited .",
    "imaging is often seen as the main goal of interferometry , despite the fact that a lot of scientific questions can be answered without reconstructing an image .",
    "we must not expect high - quality vla - type images from optical interferometers , given the much smaller number of array elements and the much larger atmospheric phase fluctuations .",
    "instead , the correct parallel to draw is with vlbi , in which closure - phase imaging is a well - established technique .",
    "the first crude images from optical arrays have been produced for binary stars ( baldwin et  al .",
    "1996 ; hummel et  al.1998 ) and barely - resolved single stars ( young et  al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the key to good imaging is a large number of array elements .",
    "this is well known by radio astronomers , and the potential in the optical is shown by the spectacular images produced with aperture - masking of single telescopes such as the keck ( tuthill et  al .",
    "images from current long - baseline arrays will not be this good , since none has more that six elements .",
    "the next generation of imaging interferometers will need at least ten , and preferably fifteen elements .",
    "apart from fringe visibility , the other main observable for an interferometer is fringe phase . with three or more telescopes ,",
    "closure phases can be used to reconstruct complex objects , as mentioned above .",
    "but even with two telescopes , useful phase measurements can be made .",
    "these involve measuring the differential phase of one object relative to another ( or one object relative to itself at different wavelengths ) , which allows very precise astrometry .",
    "a nice feature of differential phase measurements is that much interesting science can be done with point sources ( i.e. , stars ) , so that the @xmath0 limitation is overcome .",
    "examples include parallaxes and proper motions , such as small motions induced by the gravitational pull of unseen planets and , for dual - wavelength observations , the shift in photo - centre caused by the presence of a `` hot jupiter '' planet .",
    "the key technological element is a dual feed , in which two stars are observed simultaneously so that their differential phase can be measured .",
    "such a system also allows dual - wavelength operation , in which a single star is observed at two wavelengths with the two feeds .",
    "finally , the second feed can instead be used for fringe tracking on a reference star , giving longer integration times on a fainter and/or more complex source .",
    "all these techniques have been demonstrated for the first time with the pti ( lane et  al .",
    "2000 ) and , although problems remain , it appears that plans to apply these techniques to the keck interferometer and space missions are feasible .",
    "methods for using an interferometric null to allow a faint object ( e.g. , a planet ) to be seen next to a bright star are being developed by many groups ( hinz et  al .",
    "1998 ; guyon et  al .  1999",
    "; bker & allen 1999 ; velusamy et  al .",
    "1999 ; ollivier et  al .",
    "2000 ; wallace et  al .",
    "deep and stable nulls have now been demonstrated in the laboratory and with telescopes , and nulling capabilities will be included in the keck interferometer .",
    "the scientific aims include direct detection of exoplanets , and also of exo - zodiacal dust .",
    "eventually , it is hoped that space interferometers will provide images and even spectra of earth - like exoplanets . and that somewhat optimistic  but perhaps achievable ",
    "scenario seems a good place to end this review !",
