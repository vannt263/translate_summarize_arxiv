    "the transmission and the reflection are basic concepts in physics , that have been studied for strings , elastic bodies , fluids , electromagnetic waves , quantum particles , tomonaga - luttinger liquids and so on .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the study of the transmission and the reflection of collective excitations in the condensed bose system .",
    "this proceeds from the earlier study of the so - called _ anomalous tunneling",
    "_  @xcite , which is described as follows : bogoliubov excitations transmit perfectly through the potential barrier separating two condensates in the low energy limit .",
    "this is in markedly contrast to single particle tunneling in the usual quantum mechanics , where the perfect reflection occurs in the low energy limit .",
    "we review a rough sequence of studies of the anomalous tunneling .",
    "kovrizhin initially discussed the transmission coefficient of bogoliubov excitations through the @xmath0-function potential barrier  @xcite .",
    "et al . _ also studied the tunneling of bogoliubov excitations through the rectangular potential  @xcite . through the study in ref .",
    "@xcite , kagan _",
    "_ pointed out that this phenomenon is anomalous , in comparison to the usual quantum tunneling of a single particle .",
    "danshita _ et al .",
    "_ considered the transmission of bogoliubov excitations across the @xmath0-function barrier separating two condensates with different macroscopic phases  @xcite .",
    "they found that the anomalous tunneling disappears when the phase difference reaches the critical value giving the maximum supercurrent of the condensate .",
    "these works were done using the one - dimensional potential . on the other hand ,",
    "the problem of bogoliubov excitations scattered by a spherical potential was examined  @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the cross section of the low energy scattering by the spherical potential is consistent with the rayleigh scattering of a sound wave in the classical wave mechanics , _",
    "i.e. , _ the cross section vanishes in the low energy limit  @xcite .    using the fact that the wave function of the excited state in the low energy limit corresponds to the macroscopic wave function of the condensate  @xcite , kato _ et al . _",
    "concluded that the anomalous tunneling occurs for a potential barrier @xmath1 being arbitrary symmetric function ( @xmath2 )  @xcite .",
    "they also indicated that the perfect tunneling appears even at finite temperatures within the scheme of the popov approximation  @xcite .    in the tomonaga - luttinger liquids , on the other hand ,",
    "the perfect transmission has been also discussed in the context of quantum wire , using the renormalization - group  @xcite , and considering the multiple reflections  @xcite . especially , using the renormalization - group theory , it was shown that the barrier is an irrelevant perturbation in an attractive fermion system  @xcite .",
    "that is to say , the perfect transmission is known to occur in tomonaga - luttinger liquids in superconducting phase .    as seen in the above",
    ", the property of the transmission of the bogoliubov excitation in the low energy limit has not only a specific character of the condensed bose system but also something in common with that of the classical wave mechanics and that of the tomonaga - luttinger liquids . from this point of view",
    ", we have three aims in this paper as follows : ( i ) exposing novel phenomena of the transmission and the reflection of the bogoliubov phonon , ( ii ) giving a physical implication about the anomalous tunneling analogous to the classical wave mechanics , ( iii ) comparing the result of the tunneling problem of the bogoliubov phonon with that of the tomonaga - luttinger liquids .",
    "to achieve these aims , we investigate the tunneling problem of the bogoliubov phonon through the arbitrary potential barrier separating two condensates with different densities .",
    "we consider that the incident bogoliubov phonon does not only run toward the wall perpendicularly but also runs toward the wall with an arbitrary incident angle .",
    "this extended problem is analogous to the problem of the reflection and the refraction of a wave at the interface between two different mediums .",
    "we may summarize the results of this paper as follows : ( i ) the bogoliubov phonon has an incident angle where the perfect transmission occurs between condensates with different densities .",
    "this condition corresponds to the brewster s law , _",
    "i.e. _ , the sum of the incident angle and the refracted angle is equal to @xmath3",
    ". there also exists the total internal reflection of the bogoliubov excitation in the low energy limit .",
    "( ii ) the perfect transmission of the bogoliubov excitation in the low energy limit can be regarded as a result of the impedance matching between equivalent condensates separated by the potential wall .",
    "the impedance is inversely proportional to the sound speed of the bogoliubov phonon .",
    "( iii ) at normal incidence , our result in the low energy limit is consistent with the result obtained by the theory of tomonaga - luttinger liquids  @xcite , when one uses the luttinger liquid parameter for the weakly interacting bose gases .",
    "we note that the negative density reflection in the interacting condensed bose system can not be necessarily identified with the andreev reflection .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we shall give a formulation of the problem , and derive the transmission and reflection coefficients .",
    "to obtain these coefficients , we use properties that the wave function of the excited state in the low energy limit corresponds to the condensate wave function , and the constancy of the energy flux . in section iii , we shall discuss results in accordance with three aims .",

    "_ studied the wave packet dynamics , in the one - dimensional optical lattice , propagating across a boundary in the interaction strength , using the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group method  @xcite .",
    "they also discussed the negative density reflection . in these papers ,",
    "the negative density reflection is called the andreev-_like _ reflection , in the sense that the negative density reflection is analogous to the reflection of hole - like excitations at the interface between super - normal conductors .",
    "this andreev-_like _ reflection should be however distinguished from the andreev reflection in the following sense . if the condensed bose system has the andreev reflection , there should exist the retroreflection ; when the bogoliubov excitation runs toward the wall with an incident angle , the reflected excitation would go back the way one has come . in the weakly interacting bose system separated by the potential wall",
    ", however , there exists no retroreflection as shown in sec .",
    "ii , and hence there exists no andreev reflection .",
    "the reflection is just ordinary and obeys the law of reflection in eq .",

    "this observation comes from the study of the tunneling problem between different densities and at oblique incidence in the weakly interacting three - dimensional bose system . as a result",
    ", the andreev-_like _ reflection in bose system in the one - dimensional bose system is different from the andreev reflection .",
    "the realization of the bose - einstein condensation in atomic gases  @xcite has allowed us to investigate properties of bogoliubov excitations experimentally . using nondestructive phase - contrast imaging",

    "was measured in the phonon regime  @xcite .",
    "it was also reported that the excitation spectrum of a condensed bose gas agrees with the bogoliubov spectrum using the bragg scattering  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the transmission and the reflection of bogoliubov excitations are one of the issues that has not been investigated yet experimentally .",
    "it was discussed how to observe the anomalous tunneling in ref .",
    "if one investigates the reflection and the refraction of bogoliubov excitations , a potential step is needed .",
    "the potential step could be made by using a detuned laser beam shined over a razor edge  @xcite .",
    "bogoliubov excitation with a sole wave number @xmath233 could be produced by making use of the bragg pulse  @xcite .",
    "an advantage of making use of the bragg pulse to make bogoliubov excitations is that one can produce an excitation with a sole wave number @xmath233 having an arbitrary incident angle against the potential barrier .    by making use of the local modification of the trap potential ,",
    "an excitation can be also created . in this case , a density modification is composed of excitations with many modes , and hence the transmission and reflection coefficients should be estimated using a mode decomposition , in order to study the energy dependence of the transmission coefficient .",
    "if we use a box trap  @xcite , these experiments are analogous to those of the reflection and the refraction of the wave at the interface between two different homogeneous mediums .",
    "when we use a harmonic trap , not a box trap , the problem is extended to a kind of the problem of the reflection and the refraction with a refractive index which changes spatially .    in the weakly interacting one - dimensional bose system with a short - range interaction ,",

    "the result on the tomonaga - luttinger liquid suggest to us that the perfect transmission occurs in the symmetric system even if the interaction is strong . from this suggestion , not only in the weakly interacting three - dimensional bose system but also in the strongly interacting three - dimensional bose system beyond the mean - field treatment , the tunneling problem of the collective excitation",
    "should be then investigated theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the strongly interacting bose gas can be made using the feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "it is a problem whether the anomalous tunneling could be observed or not using experimental techniques mentioned above , in such a dilute ultracold gas under the control of the interaction strength . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also a problem whether the anomalous tunneling could be observed or not in superfluid he-4 which is a high dense system and a strongly interacting bose liquid .    before closing this section",
    ", we shall propose a problem on the theoretical side .",
    "recently , tsuchiya and ohashi studied tunneling properties of bogoliubov phonons taking notice of the quasi - particle current near the potential barrier  @xcite .",
    "they found that the quasi - particle current increases near the potential barrier inducing the supercurrent counterflow . in order to conserve the total current",
    ", they use the gross - pitaevskii equation added in the anomalous average .",
    "this formulation brings the gapful excitation . within their formulation with the gapful excitation",
    ", they did not confirm whether the anomalous tunneling occurs or not . on the other hand , it is reasoned that the fact that the wave function of the excited state in the low energy limit corresponds to the condensate wave function , say , the gapless excitation declared by the hugenholtz - pines theorem  @xcite , is necessary to the occurrence of the anomalous tunneling . on the basis of this idea , kato _ et al .",
    "_ used the popov approximation in order to show the occurrence of the anomalous tunneling even at finite temperatures  @xcite .",
    "however , this treatment is not also necessarily sufficient at finite temperatures , because the popov approximation does not satisfy the conservation law .",
    "hohenberg and martin  @xcite showed that the ward - takahashi relation  @xcite which guarantees the conservation law derives the hugenholtz - pines theorem . within the theory satisfying the number conservation and the gapless excitation , for instance using formulations  @xcite ,",
    "problems whether the anomalous tunneling occurs or not and how the quasi - particle current behaves still remain .",
    "we find that the bogoliubov phonon experiences the perfect transmission distinguished from the `` ordinary '' anomalous tunneling , when the incident angle satisfies the specific condition equal to the brewster s angle , _",
    "i.e. _ , the sum of the incident angle and the refracted angle is @xmath3",
    ". we also find that the bogoliubov excitation experiences the total internal reflection .",
    "introducing the impedance for the bogoliubov phonon , the anomalous tunneling can be regarded as the impedance matching . in the weakly interacting bose system with the short - range interaction ,",
