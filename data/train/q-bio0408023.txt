    "the harmonic ( or normal mode ) approximation has been a powerful tool for the analysis of few and many - body systems where the essential dynamics of the system consists of small oscillations about a well - defined mechanically stable structure . the concept of normal modes ( nms ) is appealing in science because it provides a simple view for complex systems like solids and proteins .",
    "though it had been believed that nms may be too simplistic to analyze the dynamics of proteins , that is by no means always true : the experimental data of neutron scattering for proteins ( b factor ) indicate that the fluctuations for each residue are well represented by a simplified model using nms @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that such a large - amplitude motion as the hinge - bending motion in a protein is well described by a nm @xcite .",
    "importantly , nms have been used to refine the x - ray structures of proteins @xcite .",
    "recently , large proteins or even protein complexes can be analyzed by using nms @xcite . in this chapter , we are concerned with vibrational energy relaxation ( ver ) in a protein .",
    "this subject is related to our understanding of the functionality of proteins : at the most fundamental level , we must understand the energy flow ( pathway ) of an injected energy , that is channeled to do useful work . due to the advance of larser technology",
    ", time - resolved spectroscopy can detect such energy flow phenomena experimentally @xcite . to interpret experimental data , and to suggest new experiments , theoretical approaches and simulations are essential as they can provide a detailed view of ver . however , ver in large molecules itself is still a challenging problem in molecular science @xcite .",
    "this is because ver is a typical many - body problem and estimations of quantum effects are difficult @xcite .",
    "there is a clear need to test and compare the validity of the existing theoretical methods .",
    "we here employ two different methods to estimate the ver rate in a protein , cytochrome c ( see the next section for details ) .",
    "one is the classical equilibrium simulation method @xcite with quantum correction factors @xcite .",
    "the second is the reduced model approach @xcite , which has been recently employed by leitner s group @xcite .",
    "the latter approach is based on nm concepts , which describes ver as energy transfers between nms mediated by nonlinear resonance @xcite .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the validity and applicability of such approaches .",
    "cytochrome c ( cyt c ) is one of the most thoroughly physicochemically characterized metalloproteins @xcite .",
    "it consists of a single polypeptide chain of 104 amino acid residues and is organized into a series of five @xmath0-helices and six @xmath1-turns .",
    "the heme active site in cyt c consists of a 6-coordinate low - spin iron that binds his18 and met80 as the axial ligands .",
    "in addition , two cysteines ( cys14 and cys17 ) are covalently bonded through thioether bridges to the heme ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cytc ] ) .",
    "crystal structures of cyt c show that the heme group , which is located in a groove and almost completely buried inside the protein , is non - planar and somewhat distorted into a saddle - shape geometry . the reduced protein",
    ", ferrocytochrome c ( ferrocyt c ) , is relatively compact and very stable , due to the fact that the heme group is neutral .",
    "the vibrational mode we have chosen for study is the isotopically labeled cd stretch in the terminal methyl group of the residue met80 , which is covalently bonded to fe in heme ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cytc ] ) .",
    "our simulation model approximates the protein synthesized by romesberg s group @xcite though their protein contains three deuteriums in met80 ( met80 - 3d ) .",
    "the ch and cd stretching bands are located near 3000 @xmath2 and 2200 @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "in contrast with the modeling of photolyzed co in myoglobin @xcite , essentially a diatomic molecule in a protein `` solvent , '' we are interested in the relaxation of a selected vibrational mode of a protein . as a result ,",
    "the modeling is more challenging : there is no clean separation between the system and bath modes because the cd bond is strongly connected to the environment .",
    "the classical landau - teller - zwanzig theory of ver is attractive in that it allows us to base our estimate of the ver rate on a classical force autocorrelation function that contains the interaction coupling between the system and bath modes to all orders .",
    "the hamiltonian for such a system is of the caldeira - leggett - zwanzig form , where `` bath '' coordinates are represented as normal modes of the _ bath alone._. this result is derived by using _ both _",
    "fermi s golden rule and bader - berne theory @xcite .",
    "though the transition rate @xmath3 itself can be derived without any assumption on the bath hamiltonian , the bader - berne result stems from the assumption that the bath hamiltonian is an ensemble of harmonic oscillators . ]",
    "the relaxing oscillator is introduced as a local `` system '' mode , coupled to the bath at all orders , including `` bi - linear '' coupling .",
    "efforts have been made to introduce quantum effects through the use of `` quantum correction factors . ''",
    "the dynamics of the classical system are computed , and the quantum effects are added _ a posteriori _ in a manner that accounts for the equilibrium quantum statistical distribution of the contributing quantum mechanical degrees of freedom . this approach is summarized below and applied to estimate the rate of ver for the cd bond in the terminal methyl group of met 80 in cytochrome c.      our starting point for computing the rate of vibrational energy relaxation of the cd stretching mode in cytochrome c is fermi s `` golden rule '' formula .",
    "the vibrational population relaxation rate can be written as @xcite @xmath4 where the force - force correlation function @xmath5 is defined as @xmath6 its fourier transform is @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the quantum mechanical force applied to the system mode considered , @xmath9 is the system ( reduced ) mass , @xmath10 is the system frequency , @xmath1 is an inverse temperature , and the above bracket means a quantum mechanical average .",

    "our work demonstrates both the feasibility and accuracy of a number of theoretical approaches to estimate ver rates of selected modes in proteins .",
    "the qcf approach is appealing in that the calculation of the force autocorrelation function is straightforward and feasible , even for systems of thousands of degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , the classical force autocorrelation function includes all orders of non - linearity in the interaction between the system oscillator and the surrounding bath .",
    "a weakness of the qcf approach is that we do nt know which qcf to choose _ a priori_. we must assume a mechanism for ver before computing the rate . moreover , the temperature dependence of the rate of ver is sensitive to the mechanism , whether it involves few phonons or many phonons .",
    "the choice of the form of the quantum correction factor can make a significant difference in the predicted rate of ver at lower temperatures .    on the other hand ,",
    "the reduced model approach is appealing in that the quantum dynamics of the reduced system is accurately treated . using the reduced model approach , there are two ways to estimate the quantum mechanical force autocorrelation function : ( 1 ) numerical calculation of the quantum dynamics for a model hamiltonian of a few degrees of freedom , including all orders of non - linearity in the potential , and ( 2 ) analytical solution for the quantum dynamics using perturbation theory that includes many bath modes but only the lowest order non - linear coupling between system and bath modes .",
    "we have employed the latter approach through the use of the maradudin - fein formula .",
    "a weakness of our reduced model approach is that the method neglects the higher order coupling elements beyond third order , which can not be justified _ a priori _ @xcite .",
    "we have pursued a comparative study in which we seek _ consensus _ in the estimates of @xmath12 that result of the qcf approach and the perturbation theory .",
    "a rather remarkable result of our study is that while the absolute value of the quantum corrections to the classical ver theory are large ( on the order of a factor of 40 ) , the results of the qcf and the perturbation theory approaches are in close agreement .",
    "this is all the more remarkable given the fact that the results of the perturbation theory require a calculation of the third - order coupling constants and the estimation of the `` lifetime '' parameter @xmath62 . as we have shown , the dominant channel for ver , derived from the perturbation theory , depends upon the choice of @xmath62 . for smaller @xmath134 ,",
    "the dominant mechanism is a close resonance ( within 0.1 @xmath2 ) , a combination of a heme torsion and met80 angle bending mode , with a weak coupling . for larger",
    "@xmath135 , the dominant mechanism appears to be a less perfect resonance ( within 31.7 @xmath2 ) , a combination of a different angle bending mode and a bend - stretch mode in met 80 , with a strong coupling .",
    "such detailed knowledge of @xmath62 is essential to predict a mechanism for ver .",
    "our study raises two important questions : ( 1 ) what is the optimal set of coordinates for modeling and interpreting ver in proteins ? in the qcf approach , we treated the relaxing bond ( cd bond ) as a _ local mode _ that is coupled to vibrational modes of the bath . in the reduced model approach ,",
    "on the other hand , we treated all the vibrational modes including the relaxing mode ( cd mode ) as _ normal modes _ that are coupled each other with the third order nonlinear coupling terms .",
    "our numerical results showed that the two approaches give similar results for the ver rate of the cd bond or mode , but it remains to be seen that this is a kind of coincidence or there is a theoretical ground of their equivalence ( if the qcf is appropriately chosen ) .",
    "( 2 ) what is the physical origin of the width parameter @xmath62 and how to calculate it ? in this work ,",
    "we suggested to use the relation @xmath136 where @xmath137 represents the fluctuation of the cd mode ( or bond ) frequency .",
    "we think this is reasonable but there is no theoretical explanation of this .",
    "if the ver rate does not significantly depend on @xmath62 , this is not a serious problem , but this is not always the case .",
    "thus we need an `` ab initio '' way to derive the width parameter @xmath62 .",
    "one appealing way is to regard @xmath62 as a hopping rate between potential basins ( inherent structures ) @xcite .",
    "the other is the more rigorous quantum mechanical treatment of the tier structure of energy levels in the protein @xcite .",
    "the results of our study are derived through the use of an approximate empirical energy function ( force field ) which has not been `` tuned '' to provide accurate frequencies of vibration for all protein modes .",
    "our predicted rates of ver depend sensitively on the closeness of the resonance between the system and bath modes .",
    "clearly , we must resort to the re - parameterization of the empirical potential to fit with experimental data or higher levels of theory ( ab initio quantum chemistry calculation ) in an effort to refine our estimates of the frequencies of vibration and the details of non - linear coupling between vibrational modes of the protein .",
    "this is a challenge for both experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "recent advances in experiment and theory make the present time an exciting one for the detailed study of protein dynamics .",
    "a variety of methods have been applied to examine ver in molecules , including nonequilibrium md methods @xcite , time - dependent self - consistend field methods @xcite , mixed quantum - classical methods @xcite , and semiclassical methods @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is now possible to compute spectroscopic observables such as absorption spectra or 2d - ir signals @xcite as probes of protein structure and dynamics .",
    "extensions of these studies will provide us with an increasingly detailed picture of the dynamics of proteins , and its relation to structure and function .",
