    "an unusual form of cooper pairing , called ising pairing , has recently been uncovered in two - dimensional superconducting states in mono- and few - layered transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) .",
    "tmds are materials with a 2d honeycomb lattice similar to graphene  @xcite , but with broken in - plane mirror symmetry , resulting in a special type of intrinsic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , called ising soc  .",
    "ising soc acts as an effective zeeman field which strongly polarizes the electron spins perpendicular to the 2d plane .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the more familiar rashba soc , which produces a 2d helical liquid with electron spins polarized in the in - plane directions . in tmds",
    "the spin polarizations due to ising soc are in opposite directions near opposite momentum space valleys ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , keeping time reversal symmetry intact , unlike in the case of a conventional zeeman coupling . in this work ,",
    "we describe unusual effects of soc on 2d superconductivity in tmds ( called ising superconductivity  ) , including predicting a topological superconducting ( ts ) phase with majorana fermion excitations for a chain of magnetic impurities with moments parallel to the 2d plane . our theoretical predictions , besides being of immediate experimental interest , makes the study of ising superconductivity important for fundamental physics as well as applications .    since in tmds",
    "the spin polarizations in opposite momentum space valleys are opposite , ising soc favors inter - valley pairing , where electrons with opposite momenta and spin from valleys centered around @xmath0 and @xmath1 form cooper pairs ( ising pairing )  . for conventional spin - singlet superconductors",
    "it is well known that superconductivity is quenched under the application of a magnetic field .",
    "ignoring orbital effects of the magnetic field , the quenching of superconductivity is due to zeeman coupling of the magnetic field to electron spins , and can be estimated by equating the binding energy of cooper pairs with zeeman splitting ( pauli limit ) . in ising superconductivity the intrinsic soc protects the electrons from alignment with external magnetic field when it is applied parallel to the plane .",
    "this has been experimentally confirmed with recent observations of in - plane upper critical field of more than six times the pauli paramagnetic limit in superconducting mos@xmath2 and nbse@xmath2 samples  . in this work",
    "we discuss the experimental signatures of the unusual ising soc on magnetic impurity induced yu - shiba - rusinov ( ysr ) bound states and the emergence of topological superconductivity and majorana fermion excitations in ysr bands in two - dimensional ising superconductors .",
    "magnetic impurities in superconductors can support sub - gap bound states known as yu - shiba - rusinov ( ysr ) states  @xcite .",
    "the mid - gap ysr bound states emerging due to a single localized magnetic impurity located on a @xmath3-wave superconductor can give rise to a zero bias peak ( zbp ) in the local density of states ( ldos ) measurement , signaling a level crossing and change in ground state parity of the many - body wave function  .",
    "this transition occurs when the impurity strength @xmath4 is tuned near a critical value @xmath5 .",
    "the zbps induced by ysr states can be split by an external zeeman field which couples to the spin  . here",
    "we show that the zbps arising from ysr states localized at magnetic impurities in ising superconductors are robust to an unusually high in - plane magnetic field .",
    "we demonstrate with a @xmath6-matrix calculation that ising soc is directly responsible for the anomalously large critical in - plane magnetic field where the zbp splits away from zero energy .",
    "this behavior , which correlates with the anomalously large anisotropy in upper critical fields between magnetic fields applied perpendicular and parallel to the 2d plane  , can be tested in stm experiments . moreover , for a chain of a dilute concentration of magnetic impurities with moments _ parallel _ to the plane of ising superconductors , we establish the emergence of a topological superconducting phase with end - state majorana fermions by numerical diagonalization of the bogoliubov de - gennes ( bdg ) equations . in the complementary band ( or ` wire ' ) limit , where the impurity orbitals of neighboring adatoms strongly overlap , the impurity chain realizes a ferromagnetic wire with moments parallel to the plane of the superconductor . since ising soc engenders a triplet pair potential with cooper pair spins parallel to the plane @xcite ,",
    "in this case the ferromagnetic wire becomes a topological superconductor ( in bdi class ) by proximity effect @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the case of a half - metal on ising superconductor discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we thus establish ising superconductors with magnetic adatoms with moments parallel to the plane as a robust platform for topological phenomena and majorana fermions . that moments need to be parallel to the plane",
    "is a direct consequence of ising soc ( which is perpendicular to the plane ) , in marked contrast to superconductors with rashba soc where adatom moments need to be perpendicular to the plane to support topological phases and majorana fermions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the hamiltonian for mos@xmath2 as a prototype for tmd systems and examine its fermi surface . even though we start with a hamiltonian ( eq .",
    "2 ) that has only a spin - singlet @xmath3-wave order parameter , because of the spin - orbit coupling a spin - triplet @xmath7-wave term is generated in the green s function of the superconductor ( eq .",
    "6 )  @xcite . in section iii",
    "we compute the ldos for a localized yu - shiba - rusinov state , and study its response to an external magnetic field . in section",
    "iv we discuss how a ysr band , formed with a dilute magnetic impurity chain , can host topological superconductivity . using the bdg equations for a chain of magnetic atoms embedded in a host ising superconductor , we explicitly demonstrate the existence of majorana fermion excitations by exact numerical diagonalization and also by mapping on the one dimensional kitaev model .",
    "we end with discussions and conclusion in section v.",
    "we start with the hamiltonian for a representative ising superconductor , mos@xmath2 , which in the basis @xmath8 can be written as  @xcite @xmath9 , where @xmath10 the pauli matrix @xmath11 acts in the spin space and @xmath12 . the operator @xmath13 annihilates an electron with spin @xmath14 and momentum @xmath15 .",

    "@xmath124 the term @xmath125 , where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are now the energy levels of the uncoupled ysr states ( as illustrated in figure  [ fig_shiba_spec ] , not to be confused with @xmath128 and @xmath129 in sec ii , where they stand for the valley index and chemical potential respectively ) .",
    "the pauli matrix @xmath130 now acts on the inter @xmath128-@xmath129 energy space , and @xmath131 acts on the intra @xmath128-@xmath129 energy space .",
    "the energy levels @xmath132 lie close to the midgap , while the levels @xmath133 are away from the midgap .",
    "therefore these form the @xmath128 band ( or the @xmath134 band ) and the mid - gap @xmath129 band ( or the @xmath135 band , where @xmath136 ) , in the absence of any couplings .",
    "the term @xmath137 is the effective hopping integral between sites @xmath138 and @xmath139 , and @xmath140 is the induced effective superconducting parameter .",
    "we evaluate these terms and retain couplings only upto nearest neighbor for our calculations .",
    "we find @xmath141 to be of the form @xmath142 , where @xmath143 and @xmath144 have been evaluated numerically .",
    "furthermore , @xmath145 is evaluated to be of the form @xmath146 , which is the @xmath7-wave superconducting order parameter , also inspected to be non - vanishing if the ising soc @xmath120 , and spins of the magnetic impurities lie parallel to the mos@xmath2 plane .",
    "physically , this is expected because a zeeman type field ( which is generated by the impurity spins in present case ) parallel to the spin - orbit field will not create a quasiparticle gap in the spectrum and thus will not induce topological superconductivity akin to the 1d semiconductor majorana wire platform .    on numerical diagonalization of the real space bdg equation ( eq .  [ eq_hbdg_3 ] projected onto individual ysr states ) , the midgap ysr states ( @xmath135 band ) hybridize away from @xmath147 , however two protected majorana edge modes , and an induced superconducting gap appear in the ysr band , when the impurity spins are aligned along the @xmath68 direction .",
    "figure  [ figure_majorana_1 ] shows the energy spectrum , illustrating an induced superconducting gap with two zero energy majorana modes , for a 1d chain of 72 sites .",
    "the corresponding wave - functions show localization near the edges of the chain .",
    "though , for our calculations we assumed only nearest neighbor interaction between the sites , we have checked that the emergent topological superconductivity remains intact by including longer range hopping and pairing terms in the effective tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "tmds are materials with 2d honeycomb lattice similar to graphene , but have broken in - plane mirror symmetry , resulting in a special type of intrinsic spin - orbit coupling , called ising soc .",
    "ising soc acts as an effective zeeman field which strongly polarizes the electron spins perpendicular to the 2d plane .",
    "interestingly , the spin polarization is not constant in momentum space , but rather changes sign across the @xmath148 point , which gives rise to a very high in - plane critical magnetic field in superconducting tmds  . in this work we showed that the magnetic field response of stm zero bias peaks from magnetic adatoms in ising superconductors is",
    "strongly anisotropic ( with critical zeeman fields for zbp splitting applied parallel and perpendicular to ising soc being in the ratio @xmath149 ) .",
    "this behavior of ysr states , a direct consequence of ising soc , is of immediate experimental interest .",
    "furthermore , this response also correlates well with the anomalously large anisotropy in upper critical fields between directions perpendicular and parallel to the 2d plane as revealed in recent experiments .",
    "further , we show the emergence of a topological superconducting phase in the impurity ysr band for a dilute concentration of magnetic impurities arranged in a chain - like configuration with moments parallel to the plane of the superconductor . in the topological superconducting phase ,",
    "zero energy majorana fermions appear at the ends of impurity chain and can be accessed by scanning tunneling microscopy experiments as in the recent experiments on chains of iron impurities on spin - orbit coupled pb superconductor  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of the pb superconductor we find that in order to support a topological superconducting phase the magnetic moments of the impurities embedded in ising superconductors need to be parallel ( or have a parallel component ) to the plane of the superconductor .",
    "this is a direct consequence of ising soc which consists of an effective @xmath150-dependent zeeman field perpendicular to the 2d plane . that the direction of the soc should be transverse to the direction of the zeeman field ( which in the present case is given by the magnetic moments ) for the existence of the topological superconducting phase is also true in the models of topological superconducting phase in spin - orbit coupled superconductor - semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we considered the limit of dilute concentration of impurities embedded in the ising superconductor . in the complementary band ( or ` wire ' ) limit",
    ", the impurity chain realizes a topological superconductor ( in bdi class ) by proximity effect @xcite , similar to the case of a half - metal @xcite .",
    "we thus establish ising superconductors with magnetic adatoms with moments parallel to the host superconductor as a robust platform for topological superconductivity and majorana excitations which can be probed in stm experiments .",
    "_ acknowledgement .",
    "_ the authors acknowledge discussions with j. d. sau and support from afosr ( fa9550 - 13 - 1 - 0045 ) .",
    "_ note added : _ recently another manuscript ( ref  ) appeared which draws similar conclusions . in ref .",
    "it is also concluded that tmds can support a topological superconducting state in the ysr chain , as long as the magnetic moments have a finite in - plane component .",
    "this result is consistent with our result , that adatom moments must be parallel ( or have a parallel component ) to the 2d plane .",
    "this is a crucial point in both works and the important difference from a rashba superconductor .",
    "additionally , we also study the magnetic field response of stm zero bias peaks from magnetic adatoms in ising superconductors .    10 a. h. c. neto , f. guinea , n. m. r. peres , k. s. novoselov , a. k. geim , rev .",
