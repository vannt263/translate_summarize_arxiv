    ". some may lead to the predictions deviating from that of br @xcite , for example , multi - order quantum interference vanishes according to br but could exist in some generalized probabilistic theories .",
    "it is important to experimentally inspect multi - order quantum interference to test br , since any significant nonzero observation of such interference would imply that br did not strictly hold . if br were violated , the paradigm of quantum theory might need to be amended , and computational complexity of some problems could be reduced @xcite .",
