    "@xmath1 has an elliptic fibration @xmath3 and , in this note , we call it rational elliptic surface or @xmath4k3 . ( the latter name comes from the fact that @xmath1 has 12 singular fibers of kodaira @xmath5 type while a generic elliptic k3 surface has 24 . )    the surface @xmath1 is of considerable interest in the study of gromov - witten invariants and , in fact , has been providing a testing ground for ( local ) mirror symmetry [ kmv ] of calabi - yau threefolds and its applications to enumerative geometry . for example , in [ hss ] the celebrated modell - weil group of @xmath1 has been connected to certain genus zero gromov - witten invariants of @xmath1 . in [ hst1 ] , a certain recursion relation ( _ holomorphic anomaly equation _ ) was found , which determines the generating function of gromov - witten invariants of @xmath1 for all genera .",
    "the main purpose of this note is to present a detailed study of the solutions of the holomorphic anomaly equation .",
    "also we study gromov - witten invariants using similar but more general holomorphic anomaly equation valid for all calabi - yau threefolds due to [ bcov1,2 ] , and remark a nontrivial relation between two equations .",
    "main results in this paper are * proposition 2.4 * , * tables 25 * , and * conjecture 4.3*.    to describe the setting in more detail , let us consider a calabi - yau threefold @xmath6 which contain a rational elliptic surface @xmath1 . consider the moduli space of stable maps from genus @xmath7 curves with @xmath8 point on it to @xmath1 . then genus @xmath7 gromov - witten invariant @xmath9 with @xmath10",

    "each class represents a smooth rational curve with self - intersection -1 , which can be contracted .",
    "therefore for each @xmath167 , the classes @xmath168 represent the -1 curves which we can contract . contracting these 9 curves to points @xmath169 , we obtain @xmath170 which is birational to the original @xmath2 used to define @xmath1 . from this viewpoint",
    ", we may regard the class @xmath171 as the pullback of the class of a line in @xmath170 , and @xmath172 as the class of the exceptional divisor for the blowing up at @xmath173 .",
    "the configuration of @xmath174 in @xmath170 differs from that of @xmath175 in @xmath2 , and thus blowing up these points results in rational elliptic surface @xmath176 with different complex structure from @xmath1 .",

    "that is , there is an isomorphism between the two rational elliptic surfaces @xmath1 and @xmath176 with different complex structures .",
    "( see [ lo , theorem ( 5.3 ) ] for torelli type theorem for rational surfaces . )",
    "now we may combine this isomorphism with the invariance of gromov - witten invariants under the deformations . to describe it",
    "precisely , let us write @xmath177 the gromov - witten invariants for the surface @xmath1 , and similarly @xmath178 for the surface @xmath176 .",
    "for example , let us assume @xmath176 is defined as above for the reflection @xmath161 and use the notations for @xmath179 and @xmath180 introduced above .",

    "the idea is simply to make the orbit decomposition of the generating function :    we define the _ character of the generating function ( or simply generating function _ ) , @xmath187 by @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the character defined by @xmath190 for @xmath191 with the cup product @xmath89 extended to over @xmath192 .    * remark * ( 1 ) the condition @xmath193 restricts the classes @xmath15 to those of @xmath8-sections .",

    "if we omit these rather trivial cases @xmath200 from our consideration , we see that the condition @xmath201 coincides with that @xmath15 belongs to an integral class contained in the tits cone .",
    "now it is obvious from proposition [ th : weylng ] that the invariant @xmath9 is determined by its value for @xmath15 in the closure @xmath104 of the fundamental weyl chamber .",
    "the integral elements @xmath202 in the fundamental weyl chamber are called _ dominant weight of level _",
    "@xmath203 if they satisfies @xmath204 . if @xmath202 is dominant integral weight of level @xmath8 , then so is @xmath205 for arbitrary integer @xmath206 . to choose this @xmath206 as small as possible , we impose the following numerical conditions ; @xmath207    we will call the dominant weights satisfying ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) _ minimal_.    we denote the set of minimal dominant weights of level @xmath8 by @xmath208 , i.e. @xmath209    it is easy to verify that each fundamental weight @xmath131 introduced in ( [ eqn : fweight ] ) is minimal as well as dominant .",
    "note that addition of minimal dominant weights results in a dominant weight , however the minimality of weights is not preserved",
    ". now it will be convenient to define the addition among the minimal dominant weight by @xmath210 for minimal dominant weights @xmath211 .",
    "hereafter we write the fundamental weights @xmath212 by @xmath213 with this understanding for the addition . in table 1 , elements in @xmath208 are listed for @xmath214 .",

    "since the integral classes @xmath15 with @xmath218 are contained in the tits cone , for each weyl orbit we may take a unique representative in the closure @xmath104 of the fundamental weyl chamber .",
    "then we have @xmath219 where we remark that if @xmath202 sits in the walls of @xmath104 , it has nontrivial stabilizers . also the summation over @xmath206 has in fact lower bound ( , see remark below ) .    * remark * by general property of gromov - witten invariants , we have @xmath220 unless @xmath221 is effective . since @xmath221 is not effective for @xmath222",

    "\\(2 ) in ref.[gv ] , assuming the fibration @xmath390 and the decomposition ( [ eqn : gvdecomp ] ) , it is argued in general that @xmath391 where @xmath392 represents the euler number .",
    "( these equations hold also in the formulation via intersection cohomology . ) also the @xmath393 brane moduli space @xmath46 is naively claimed as the jacobian fibration made over the moduli space of curves @xmath394 with @xmath395=\\beta$ ] , which we write @xmath363 .",

    "this intuition is also naively expected in [ gv ] for general @xmath277 @xmath397 , i.e. the numbers are the euler numbers of the locus on @xmath363 where nodal ( genus @xmath306 ) curves appear .",
    "again , because of the possible complicated degenerations of the curves , it is known that for this intuition to work , we need to take into account some corrections , by hand , depending on degeneration type[kkv ] .    in our case of curves in a surface @xmath1",

    "we may verify directly that our functions @xmath532 and @xmath533 satisfy the above recursion relation with @xmath534 for @xmath342 , the corresponding recursion relation for @xmath535 follows directly from [ bcov2 ] ( , see also [ kkv ] ) .",
    "we can also find the rational function @xmath536 of the form stated above , although we do not reproduce its lengthy form here .",
