    "as it is prevalently known , quantum mechanics forbids the copying of individual quantum systems , however , it is still possible to create imperfect replicas of a quantum state with optimal fidelity  @xcite .",
    "this protocol , originally introduced by buek and hillery  @xcite , is called quantum cloning , and it has been studied very extensively ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "in this paper we are interested in universal cloning transformations for individual quantum bits .",
    "a quantum circuit was designed by buek et al . for this purpose  @xcite , which was later generalized to arbitrary dimensional quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "we shall call this circuit ucqc ( universal covariant quantum cloner ) in what follows .",
    "it has a special feature of being quantum controlled , that is , the fidelity ratio of the two clones is controlled by the initial quantum state of two ancillary quantum bits ( one of which will carry the clone after the process ) .",
    "this idea turned out to be related to the concept of programmable quantum networks or quantum processors  @xcite .",
    "these are fixed quantum networks which are capable of performing operations on quantum systems in a way that the operation itself is encoded into the initial quantum state of ancillae .",
    "it was found that the very circuit for universal quantum cloning is in fact a probabilistic universal quantum processor  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider ucqc - s as entanglement manipulation devices . in the context of cloning",
    ", one may ask several questions . one may consider the cloning of an entangled quantum state as a whole , in order to obtain similar entangled pairs . for two qubits",
    "this has been analyzed in detail by by several authors  @xcite .",
    "in particular , buek at al .  @xcite compare the fidelity of cloning of an entangled pair by global and local operations .",
    "another approach might be the broadcasting of entanglement , proposed by buek et al .",
    "in this case two parties share an entangled pair and use cloners locally to obtain two partially entangled pairs .",
    "this protocol attracted a relevant attention in the literature , too .",
    "topics such as state - dependent broadcasting  @xcite , broadcasting of multipartite entangled states : w - states  @xcite , ghz - states  @xcite , and linear optical realizations  @xcite were discussed in detail . our present study is motivated mainly by these works .",
    "consider an entangled pair .",
    "it is always interesting to ask what happens to the entanglement if any of the members of the pair is subjected to some quantum information processing protocol . in the case of quantum teleportation , for instance",
    ", rather strikingly the teleported qubit inherits the entanglement of the original qubit with its pair .",
    "it is rather natural to ask what happens in the case of a universal quantum cloner .",
    "the answer for qubit pairs is partly given by bandyopadhyay and kar  @xcite .",
    "they show that if a member ( or both members ) of a maximally entangled qubit pair is subjected to an optimal universal quantum cloning operation , the resulting state is a werner state .",
    "it is likely , however , that a cloning transformation is realized by some quantum circuit , which uses ancillae for carrying out the operation .",
    "it is obviously interesting how the entanglement between the different quantum bits of such a scenario ( including also ancillae ) behaves . in this paper",
    "we consider the ucqc as a circuit , not only the cloning operation itself .",
    "we calculate entanglement as measured by concurrence .",
    "it turns out that the ancillae play a very specific role and the behavior of concurrence shows a rather interesting pattern .",
    "the recent optical realization of certain programmable quantum gate arrays  @xcite also contributes to the relevance of this question .",
    "another similar question might be the partial extraction of bipartite entanglement from a ghz - type threepartite resource .",
    "it is known that if a three qubits are in a ghz state  @xcite , then a measurement on either of the three qubits in the @xmath0 basis ( eigenbasis of the @xmath1 pauli - operator ) projects the state of the remaining two qubits into a maximally entangled state . we show that if the given particle is cloned in advance , it is possible to create bipartite entanglement by measuring the clone , while there still remains some purely threepartite entangled resource in the state of the three parties .",
    "this is indicated by the possibility of entangling a different pair of qubits by a next measurement .",
    "the nature of the entanglement in the multipartite system can be also analyzed with the aid of the coffman - kundu - wootters inequalities  @xcite , which quantify the monogamy of entanglement .",
    "we shall present such an analysis , too .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : eprclone ] we analyze the behavior of bipartite entanglement in the case when ucqc is applied to clone a member of a maximally entangled pair . in section  [ sec : ghz ] we consider the application of ucqc for the partial extraction of bipartite entanglement from a greenberger - horne - zeilinger state . in section  [ sec : concl ] the results are summarized and conclusions are drawn .",
    "the considered setup is depicted in fig .  [ fig : setup ] .",
    "the quantum circuit in the dashed box is the universal quantum cloner  @xcite .",
    "its first input port ( which is port 2 in our current notation ) receives the state to be cloned , while on the second two ports there impinges a so - called program state : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a normalization constant and @xmath4 . were a single - qubit state @xmath5 impingent on port 2",
    ", the output states would be : @xmath6 the clones reside in ports 2 and 3 , the original qubit and the first ancilla , whereas in the port 4 there is an ancilla , the state of which is a mixture of the state described by the mixture of the transpose of the density operator of the original state and the identity operator .",
    "the fidelity of the clones depends on the value of @xmath7 : for @xmath8 there is no cloning , whereas for @xmath9 the state of the original qubit is fully transferred to the clone , leaving the original qubit in a completely mixed state . for other values of alpha",
    "there are optimal clones generated .",
    "note the symmetry of the formulae in @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "let us return to the description of the whole scenario in argument , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the qubits 1 and 2 carry the initial bipartite input state .",
    "qubit 2 is subject to cloning , while qubit 1 , the first part of the pair is not manipulated .",
    "we are interested in the entanglement relations between the different pairs of qubits in the resulting state . as for the measure of bipartite entanglement for qubits ,",
    "we apply concurrence according to the wootters formula : for a quantum state @xmath5 of two qubits , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the wootters - tilde , @xmath13 is the second pauli - operator , and @xmath14 is the transpose of the density matrix @xmath5 in the product basis  @xcite .    as an input state we consider a state in either of the following four forms : @xmath15 as for the nonzero concurrences between the various pairs of qubits , we obtain the behavior in fig .",
    "[ fig : epr3d ] , regardless of the choice from the above states .",
    "the output states , however , depend on this actual choice , we shall comment on this later .        in the figure one can observe that the entanglement between qubits 1 ( the one not manipulated ) and qubit 2 ( the original qubit ) behaves in the similar way as that between qubit 1 and 3 ( the one not manipulated and the clone ) . for @xmath8 ( no cloning ) ,",
    "qubits 1 and 2 are entangled as they were originally , while for @xmath9 , complete cloning , the entanglement is transferred to qubits 1 and 3 , the clone plays the role of the former original qubit completely .",
    "the surfaces representing the concurrence for the pairs 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 are symmetric in the cloning parameter @xmath7 , that is , they can be obtained from each other by the @xmath16 substitution .",
    "the dependence of these entanglements from @xmath7 is monotonous but not continuous : for small values there is a region where the entanglement is zero , and it appears suddenly and non continuously .",
    "the dependence of these concurrences on the initial entanglement in the state @xmath17 is monotonous and continuous .",
    "it is also interesting to observe that a similar non - symmetric behavior appears in the concurrence of qubits 3 - 4 and 2 - 4 .",
    "the program state of eq .  , in which the qubits 3 - 4 are prepared initially , is maximally entangled for @xmath8 , the case of no cloning , and its entanglement decreases with the increase of the cloning parameter @xmath7 .",
    "accordingly , the entanglement of qubits 3 - 4 decreases with @xmath7 also after the cloning operation , while the complementary behavior ( in the sense of @xmath16 substitution ) appears between qubits 2 and 4 ( the cloned part of the input state and the ancilla of the cloner ) .",
    "note that the entanglement of qubits 3 and 4 is not equal to their entanglement _ before _ the cloning operation : the concurrence of the partially entangled program state in eq .   is a monotonous and continuous function of @xmath7 , and its values are not equal to the concurrences after the cloning operation .",
    "moreover , the concurrence of qubits 3 and 4 after the cloning also depends slightly on that of the input state of qubits 1 and 2 , in eq .",
    "[ eq : instate2 ] .    as for the remaining pairs , qubits 1 and 4 (",
    "the qubit not manipulated and the ancilla ) will not be entangled , while between qubits 2 and 3 ( the second input state and its clone ) , as a nontrivial effect , there is a small amount of entanglement appearing only in the case the input state ( of qubits 1 - 2 ) is only slightly entangled .",
    "a special case arises if the input state of qubits 1 and 2 is maximally entangled .",
    "this is the case of @xmath18 in fig  [ fig : epr3d ] .",
    "the concurrence between qubits 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 ( two originals , two program qubits of the cloner ) is equal to each other .",

    "the value of the parameter @xmath22 is @xmath23 for pairs 1 - 2 and 3 - 4 , while it is @xmath24 note that the denominator on the right - hand - side of the above formulae comes directly from the normalization constant of the program state in eq .",

    "is merely a consequence of our particular choice of parameters ) . in the case",
    "we choose a different one from the states in eq .",
    ", we obtain local unitary transforms of the werner state in eq .  .",
    "the message of the consideration for cloning an element of a maximally entangled pair is not the fact that werner states are obtained in qubits 1 - 2 and 1 - 3 , since it was known from the literature  @xcite .",
    "what is nontrivial here that in the ucqc circuit this behavior is repeated between the ancilla ( qubit 4 ) , and qubits 2 and 3 , and this holds only in the case of the cloning of a member of a maximally entangled state .",
    "finally let us note that the behavior of qubits 2 , 3 , and 4 can not depend on the properties of qubit 1 since it is a remote system from the ucqc s point of view .",
    "it is the reduced density operator of qubit 2 which can influence their behavior .",
    "we have found that only for a maximally entangled pair , a concurrence characterizing a nonlocal property is equal to another concurrence which is a local property of the cloner .",
    "in this section we consider the case in which a member of a greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state is cloned .",
    "this tripartite state , of the form @xmath25 is known to be genuinely tripartite entangled .",
    "that is , all the pairwise entanglements ( as measured by concurrence ) are zero , however , all of the three qubits are in a maximally entangled state .",
    "when any of the qubits is subject to a von neumann measurement in the basis @xmath26 the other two qubits will be in either of the maximally entangled bell - states @xmath27 depending on the measurement result .",
    "the probability of the measurement results are equal . in this way",
    "the tripartite entangled resource in the ghz state can be converted into maximal bipartite entanglement .",

    "their value is represented by curves `` a '' and `` b '' in fig .  [",
    "fig : ghzconc ] .",
    "this fact is easily explained by the following reasoning . from the point of view of the ucqc circuit , qubits 1 and 2 are remote ones , thus they can not influence the local properties of qubits 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "all we `` see '' at the locus of the ucqc is that qubit 3 is in a maximally mixed state , as it is a member of the maximally entangled threepartite ghz state of eq  .",
    "but the same situation would arise if qubit 3 were maximally entangled in a bipartite sense with one additional qubit , as we have considered in the previous section .",
    "thus the behavior of concurrences between the pairs ancilla - original and ancilla - clone are the very same as in the case of cloning a member of a bipartite maximally entangled state ( or a member of any kind of multipartite entangled state which is itself in a completely mixed state for this reason ) : werner states are obtained .",
