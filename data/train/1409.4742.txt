    "this is a non - euclidean analogue of the fact that in the euclidean case , the ratio of the two corresponding lengths is the cosine of the angle they make .",

    "spherics_. menelaus result is of major importance from the historical point of view , because the author gave only a sketch of a proof , and writing a complete proof of it gave rise to several mathematical developments by arabic mathematicians between the 9th and the 13th centuries .",
    "( one should remember that the set of spherical trigonometric formulae that is available to us today and on which we can build our proofs was not available at that time . )",
    "these developments include the discovery of duality theory and in particular the definition of the polar triangle in spherical geometry , as well as the introduction of an invariant spherical cross ratio .",
    "it is also probable that the invention of the sine rule was motivated by this result .",
    "all this is discussed in the two papers @xcite and @xcite , which contains a report on the proof of menelaus theorem completed by several arabic mathematicians .",
    "the proof that we give of the hyperbolic version of that theorem works as well in the spherical case , with a modification which , at the formal level , amounts to replacing some hyperbolic functions by the corresponding circular functions .",
