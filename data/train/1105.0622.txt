    "since neutron stars are too far in space , the big bang is too long back in time and astrophysical observations are too indirect , the only possibility to investigate the phase transition of qcd experimentally is by heavy - ion collisions . here , matter is created under extreme conditions , in small systems and with fast dynamics .",
    "it is , therefore , likely that nonequilibrium effects play an important role in the evolution of the fireball .",
    "nonequilibrium methods have also been applied to other systems of extreme conditions , e.g. in the inflationary evolution of the early universe @xcite and the formation of bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "the predictions of most observables of the conjectured critical point are based on the striking feature of diverging fluctuations and correlation lengths in thermodynamic systems at criticality .",
    "these should be visible in event - by - event fluctuations of particle multiplicities @xcite .",
    "the proposed experimental measures of fluctuations , which are based on the second moments of the particle distributions did not show any increase in the energy range of @xmath0 gev at na49 @xcite .",
    "the key observable for the beam energy scan at rhic is the net - proton kurtosis @xcite , based on the fourth moment of the distribution .",
    "it has the advantage that in thermodynamic systems the kurtosis diverges with higher powers of the correlation length than the second moments @xcite .",
    "it is , however , unclear if the system created in a heavy - ion collision is in thermal equilibrium at the phase transition . here ,",
    "relaxation times become large , whereas the dynamics of a heavy - ion collision is very fast . even if the system is in equilibrium above the phase transition it is likely to be driven out of equilibrium as it cools through the phase transition . at a second order phase transition",
    "this is called critical slowing down and severely limits the growth of the correlation length @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "one expects any signal of a critical point to be weakened in a dynamic nonequilibrium situation .",
    "signals of a first order phase transition , however , are based on nonequilibrium effects , such as supercooling . here ,",
    "parts of the system remain for some time in the high - temperature phase even below the transition temperature .",
    "the decay of this unstable state occurs via either nucleation or spinodal decomposition .",
    "a proposed signal for a nonequilibrium situation at a chiral phase transition is the enhancement of soft pions from the decay of disoriented chiral condensates @xcite .",
    "nonequilibrium phenomena can be studied in the framework of langevin dynamics . here ,",
    "the chiral fields are split into hard and soft modes .",
    "the hard modes constitute a heat bath for the soft modes . due to the interaction with the hard modes",
    "the soft modes undergo additional dissipative processes .",
    "calculations of the influence functional for a system of soft modes interacting with a heat bath of hard modes have extensively been studied in @xmath1 theory @xcite , in gauge theories @xcite and in @xmath2 chiral models @xcite . however ,",
    "the back reaction of the soft modes on the hard modes , e.g. the exchange of energy is typically not included in these influence functional studies .",
    "a framework which is based on the conservation of energy and particle numbers is fluid dynamics .",
    "chiral fluid dynamics combines the dynamics of heavy - ion collisions with the explicit propagation of the chiral fields at the chiral phase transition .",
    "the common idea is to embed a low energy effective model of qcd into a fluid dynamic simulation of a heavy - ion collision .",
    "a model that is particularly well suited for this combined approach is the linear sigma model with constituent quarks @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the quarks is reduced to a fluid dynamic evolution of densities .",
    "this gives rise to the name chiral fluid dynamics .",
    "the quarks are thus assumed to be locally equilibrated and act as a heat bath with local temperatures . in @xcite an additional dilaton field",
    "was included in the explicit dynamics to model scale invariance breaking in qcd .",
    "strong nonlinear oscillations were found for all the classical fields at the phase transition . from these oscillations",
    "the particle production of sigmas , pions and glueballs was calculated . in @xcite initial fluctuations",
    "were propagated deterministically through the phase transition .",
    "the linear sigma model with constituent quarks treats the quarks and antiquarks and the mesons on equal footing . in the real world",
    "confining forces recombine quarks and antiquarks in mesons and baryons below the confinement critical temperature .",
    "the aspect of confinement is not included in the linear sigma model with constituent quarks . in extensions of the model gluons are included on the level of the dilaton field @xcite or the polyakov loop @xcite . in all the existing approaches",
    "so far @xcite the time evolution of the chiral fields is given by the classical equations of motion .",
    "thus , the chiral fields are explicitly propagated out of equilibrium with the quarks and do not relax to their equilibrium value for the temperatures given by the heat bath .",
    "relaxational and stochastic processes have been neglected .",
    "a formalism which is capable of including dissipation and noise together with a consistent back reaction on the heat bath is provided by the so - called 2pi formalism .",
    "two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) diagrams are closed diagrams which do not fall apart when cutting two lines .",
    "consequently the 2pi formalism deals with full one - point ( mean - field ) and full two - point functions ( full propagators ) .",
    "it has been originally developed as a functional formalism in @xcite and was extended to yield transport equations in a quantum theory that preserve the macroscopic conservation laws and are thermodynamically consistent in the equilibrium limit @xcite .",
    "these can be found from a certain class of approximations , called @xmath3-derivable , to the schwinger - dyson equation for the two - point function . in the path integral formulation of this approach",
    "@xcite it turns out that the @xmath3-functional is identical to the nontrivial part of the two - particle irreducible effective action . in @xcite",
    "this selfconsistent approach is generalized to arbitrary nonequilibrium many - body systems .",
    "renormalization of @xmath3-derivable approximations is studied in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend existing chiral fluid dynamic models by the consistent inclusion of damping and noise in the dynamics of the order parameter of chiral symmetry , the sigma field . to achieve this",
    "we apply two methods of nonequilibrium quantum field theory , the influence functional and the two - particle irreducible effective ( 2pi ) action , to the linear sigma model with constituent quarks . in the influence functional method",
    "the separation of the systems seems obvious in our approach to chiral fluid dynamics .",
    "we consider the quarks as the heat bath and treat the sigma field as the relevant sector .",
    "the influence functional is obtained by perturbatively integrating out the quarks .",
    "we obtain the proper langevin equation for the sigma field .",
    "however , in the influence functional method it is not possible to control the local equilibrium properties of the quarks without further assumptions .",
    "we need to go beyond existing studies of langevin equations by putting special emphasis on the properties and the evolution of the heat bath itself .",
    "we expect that the back reaction to the heat bath induced by the dynamics of the chiral fields can be important for the overall evolution of the system .    in order to derive the nonequilibrium propagation of the chiral fields and the thermodynamic properties of the quarks selfconsistently we apply the formalism of the 2pi effective action .",
    "the analysis of the chiral order parameter , the @xmath4 field will be restricted to the mean field .",
    "one often defines the mean field as an average over quantum and thermal fluctuations in which case there is neither damping nor noise . within the 2pi effective action formalism the mean field is obtained from an integration over quantum fluctuations only and thus still contains the necessary information about dissipation and noise .",
    "for a first qualitative analysis we restrict our model on the effect of the chiral phase transition and do not include the polyakov loop .",
    "the polyakov loop extended model describes confinement well on a statistical level and thermodynamic quantities have been calculated @xcite but it is not evident how to treat the polyakov loop dynamically . in our present analysis we also neglect the pion degrees of freedom .",
    "their vacuum expectation value vanishes anyway . from a conceptual point of view",
    "their inclusion provides no further problems .",
    "their physical significance is largest below the chiral phase transition . as quasi - goldstone bosons the pions are very light .",
    "therefore they can be produced from the decay of the sigma meson , leading to additional damping of the sigma field .",
    "the hard modes yield a sizable contribution to the heat bath with their own equation of state .",
    "thus this needs to be included in a two - fluid dynamic description . obtaining the langevin equation for the soft pion modes",
    "is also a straightforward task .",
    "the inclusion of pions is devoted to future work . in the present work",
    "we explain the formalism of the coupled system of the explicitly propagated degrees of freedom and the fluid dynamic expansion of the heat bath . in an upcoming paper",
    "we will present detailed numerical results in a one - fluid dynamic set up .",
    "for the time being we concentrate on the heat bath of quarks and antiquarks .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : linsigmamodel ] we briefly review the linear sigma model with constituent quarks and its phase structure .",
    "the influence functional is calculated in section [ sec : siflinsig ] including the damping and the noise kernel . in section [ sec:2pieacal ]",
    "we apply the formalism of the 2pi effective action .",
    "both approaches yield the same langevin equation for the sigma field , calculated in section [ sec : sc_eomsigmafield ] . in the exact formalism of the 2pi effective action a conserved energy - momentum tensor of the entire system can be constructed .",
    "we will derive this form and comment on the energy - momentum conservation of approximations to the full equations in section [ sec : sc_energyconservation ] .",
    "the linear sigma model with nucleons @xcite has been studied for years as the prototype effective model of dynamic chiral symmetry breaking . the coupling to dynamic quark degrees of freedom instead of nucleons yields the additional feature that the quarks with light current masses obtain a heavy mass at the phase transition and thus turn into constituent quarks @xcite .",

    "the explicit symmetry breaking term taking into account the finite quark masses is @xmath17 with the pion mass @xmath18  mev . with these requirements , @xmath19 . choosing @xmath20 yields a realistic vacuum sigma mass @xmath21  mev . in order to have zero potential energy in the ground state the term @xmath22",
    "is subtracted . at a coupling @xmath23",

    "the one - loop thermodynamic potential in mean - field approximation is @xmath25 with the chiral potential @xmath26 and the quark contribution @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the quark chemical potential and @xmath29 is the degeneracy factor of the quarks for @xmath30 flavors , @xmath31 colors and the two spin states . though technically very similar there is a noteworthy difference to the calculation of the partition function for free fermions with mass @xmath32 . in the lagrangian ( [ eq : lgml ] )",
    "there is no fermionic mass .",
    "the quark mass is generated by nonvanishing expectation values of the chiral fields due to spontaneous symmetry breaking . during the evaluation of the functional determinant in dirac and isospin space one",
    "generates a term defined as the effective mass of the quarks @xmath33 then , the energy of the quarks and antiquarks is @xmath34 this is obviously not a medium - independent quantity as the chiral expectation values depend on both medium parameters @xmath35 and @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the divergent term in ( [ eq : lsm_omegaq1 ] ) can not be subtracted as a simple zero - temperature contribution .",
    "it needs to be renormalized more carefully . by using standard renormalization techniques one part of the divergence",
    "can be absorbed in the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 of the classical potential @xmath26 , while a logarithmic term depending on @xmath38 and the renormalization scale remains .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that by neglecting this contribution one fails to reproduce the second order phase transition for @xmath39 in the chiral limit . in @xcite",
    "the renormalization scale dependence was investigated phenomenologically .",
    "a thorough study of medium dependent corrections to mean - field calculations , perturbative and renormalization group approaches to yukawa theory , also shows a crucial effect on the phase structure @xcite .    to achieve the goal of this work , namely the coupling of chiral nonequilibrium dynamics at the phase transition to a fluid dynamic expansion of the matter , we need a field - theoretical model exhibiting a phase transition .",
    "this is given by the mean - field approximation @xcite and we can neglect the effects of the vacuum correction .",
    "the pressure of the system is @xmath40 from which all thermodynamic quantities can be calculated .",

    "in summary , we have presented a consistent nonequilibrium approach to chiral fluid dynamics , which on the one hand extends existing chiral fluid dynamic models by the inclusion of dissipation and fluctuations and on the other hand goes beyond existing studies of langevin dynamics by putting special emphasis on the local equilibrium properties of the heat bath , i.e. on the back reaction of the chiral modes on the heat bath .    the sigma field as the order parameter of chiral symmetry breaking",
    "is coupled to a fluid dynamic expansion of quarks and antiquarks .",
    "the interaction is given by the linear sigma model with constituent quarks , which exhibits dynamic chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "due to this coupling the effective potential for the sigma field changes by the cooling given by the expanding quark fluid .",
    "we succeeded in deriving the relaxational dynamics of the sigma field from the 2pi effective action . in existing chiral fluid dynamic models the sigma field",
    "is propagated according to a deterministic classical euler - lagrange equation of motion .",
    "the 2pi effective action includes dissipative processes and gives rise to a damping term and a stochastic field .",
    "we explicitly evaluated the damping coefficient and the correlation of the stochastic field in markovian approximation for the zero mode of the sigma field .",
    "although there is no confinement in the underlying theory , the damping coefficient caused by the interaction of the sigma field with the quarks vanishes below the phase transition temperature due to kinematic reasons .",
    "while the quarks gain the constituent quark mass , the sigma mass gets smaller at the first order phase transition and very small at a critical point . even at a realistic coupling of @xmath23",
    "the vacuum sigma mass is larger than twice the constituent quark mass .",
    "the damping coefficient can similarily be derived in the influence functional method , where an explicit splitting of the system in a relevant sector , here the sigma field , and an environment , here the quarks , must a priori be assumed . in these terms",

    "it is a conserving and selfconsistent approximation to the full quantum theory . besides the equation of motion for the sigma mean - field",
    "we obtain a dyson - schwinger equation for the real - time quark propagators . from the exact ( for a given 2pi effective action ) solution for the quark propagator",
    "we could construct a conserved energy - momentum tensor . for an explicit solution to the dyson - schwinger equation we had to make further approximations .",
    "we were able to identify different terms in the divergence of the energy - momentum tensor of the entire system : a thermal part which coincides with the energy - momentum tensor for the classical fields and a correction term for both the quark and the sigma contributions to the energy - momentum balance .",
    "the correction to energy - momentum tensor of the sigma field includes the dissipative dynamics of the mean - field .",
    "however , it does not account for the fluctuation energy transferred to the heat bath via the stochastic noise field .",
    "the presented set up gives a consistent nonequilibrium description of the coupled dynamics of the sigma field and the quark fluid .",
    "the entire system expands and cools .",
    "it thus describes a realistic expansion of a heavy - ion collision modeled by ideal fluid dynamics .",
    "numerical results will be published in a separate work .    below the phase transition the zero - mode damping coefficient originating from the interaction of the sigma field with the quarks vanishes",
    ". it would be interesting to include the effect of higher modes and see how this leads to additional damping processes .",
    "however , this would go beyond the markovian approximation and thus complicates future numerical studies .",
    "additional damping processes potentially also come from the interaction of the soft modes of the sigma field with the hard sigma and pion modes .",
    "these processes definitely occur below the phase transition and assure relaxational dynamics of the sigma field .",
