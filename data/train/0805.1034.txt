    "superfluidity is a phase of matter in which `` unusual '' effects are observed when liquids , typically of helium-4 or helium-3 , overcome friction by surface interaction when at a stage , known as the `` lambda point '' for helium-4 , at which the liquid s viscosity becomes zero .",
    "also known as a major facet in the study of quantum hydrodynamics , it was discovered by pyotr leonidovich kapitsa , john f. allen , and don misener in 1937 and has been described through phenomenological and microscopic theories .",
    "atoms helium have two stable isotopes @xmath3he and @xmath4he .",
    "@xmath3he consists of two electrons , two protons and two neutrons , which are six fermions .",
    "therefore , @xmath3he has an integral spin and obey the bose - einstein statistics .",
    "liquid @xmath3he , called the bose liquid , displays a direct transition from the normal liquid state ( liquid he i ) to the superfluid state ( liquid he ii ) at temperature @xmath5 , which can be considered as the condensation of particles at simple quantum state .",
    "the main objectives of this article are 1 ) to establish a time - dependent ginzburg - landau model for liquid @xmath3he , and 2 ) to study its dynamic phase transitions .",
    "hereafter , we shall present briefly the main ingredients of the study presented in this article .",
    "the ideas and method in this article can be used to study @xmath4he and its mixture with @xmath3he ; this study will be reported elsewhere .",
    "first , in the late 1930s , ginzburg - landau proposed a mean field theory of continuous phase transitions . with the successful application of the ginzburg - landau theory to superconductivity ,",
    "it is nature to transfer something similar to the superfluidity case , as the superfluid transitions in liquid @xmath4he and @xmath3he are of similar quantum origin as superconductivity .",
    "unfortunately , we know that the classical ginzburg - landau free energy is poorly applicable to @xmath3he in a quantitative sense , as described in by ginzburg in @xcite .    the starting point of the modeling used in this article is to introduce a general principle , based on the le chtelier principle and some general characteristics of pseudo - gradient flow systems .",
    "this general principle leads to a unified approach to derive ginzburg - landau type of time - dependent models for equilibrium phase transitions . with this general principle in our disposal",
    ", we derive some dynamic models for superfluid transitions .",
    "in addition , an important difference for the new dynamic models introduced here in this article from the classical ones is based on the separation of superfluid and normal fluid densities as described in ( [ 8.199 ] ) and their interactions in the ginzburg - landau free energies .    second , classically , phase transitions are classified by the ehrenfest classification scheme , based on the lowest derivative of the free energy that is discontinuous at the transition .",
    "the superfluid phase transitions has been regarded as continuous phase transitions , also called second - order phase transitions",
    ". however , many important issues are still still not clear ; see among many others ginzburg @xcite , reichl @xcite and onuki @xcite .    one important new ingredient for the analysis is a new dynamic transition theory developed recently by the authors @xcite . with this theory",
    ", we derive a new dynamic phase transition classification scheme , which classifies phase transitions into three categories : type - i , type - ii and type - iii , corresponding respectively to the continuous , the jump and mixed transitions in the dynamic transition theory .",
    "the results in this article lead to two physical predictions : 1 ) the existence of the unstable region @xmath0 , where both solid and liquid he ii states appear randomly depending on fluctuations , and 2 ) the existence of a switch point @xmath1 , where the transitions , between superfluid state ( liquid he ii ) and the normal fluid state ( liquid he i ) , changes from first order ( type ii with the dynamic classification scheme ) to second order ( type - i ) .",
    "of course , these predictions need to be verified by experiments , and it is hoped that the new model , the ideas and methods introduced in this article will lead to some improved understanding of superfluidity .    this article is organized as follows .",
    "first , the new dynamic transition theory is recapitulated in section 2 , and a dynamic phase transition model for @xmath3he is introduced in discussed in section 3 .",
    "the dynamic transitions of the the model is analyzed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 gives some physical conclusions and predictions .",
    "in this section , we introduce a new phase dynamic transition classification scheme to classify phase transitions into three categories : type - i , type - ii and type - iii , corresponding mathematically continuous , jump mixed transitions , respectively .      in sciences , nonlinear dissipative systems are generally governed by differential equations , which can be expressed in the following abstract form let @xmath6 and @xmath7 be two banach spaces , and @xmath8 a compact and dense inclusion . in this chapter ,",
    "we always consider the following nonlinear evolution equations @xmath9 where @xmath10 is unknown function , and @xmath11 is the system parameter .",
    "assume that @xmath12 is a parameterized linear completely continuous field depending contiguously on @xmath11 , which satisfies @xmath13 in this case , we can define the fractional order spaces @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "then we also assume that @xmath16 is @xmath17 bounded mapping for some @xmath18 , depending continuously on @xmath11 , and @xmath19    hereafter we always assume the conditions ( [ 5.2 ] ) and ( [ 5.3 ] ) , which represent that the system ( [ 5.1 ] ) has a dissipative structure .    a state of the system ( [ 5.1 ] ) at @xmath2",
    "is usually referred to as a compact invariant set @xmath20 . in many applications",
    ", @xmath20 is a singular point or a periodic orbit .",
    "a state @xmath20 of ( [ 5.1 ] ) is stable if @xmath20 is an attractor ; otherwise @xmath20 is called unstable .",
    "[ d7.1 ] we say that the system ( [ 5.1 ] ) has a phase transition from a state @xmath20 at @xmath21 if @xmath20 is stable on @xmath22 ( or on @xmath23 ) and is unstable on @xmath24 ( or on @xmath22 ) .",
    "the critical parameter @xmath25 is called a critical point . in other words",
    ", the phase transition corresponds to an exchange of stable states .",
    "obviously , the attractor bifurcation of ( [ 5.1 ] ) is a type of transition .",
    "however , bifurcation and transition are two different , but related concepts .",
    "let @xmath26 be the eigenvalues ( counting multiplicity ) of @xmath27 , and assume that @xmath28    the following theorem is a basic principle of transitions from equilibrium states , which provides sufficient conditions and a basic classification for transitions of nonlinear dissipative systems .",
    "this theorem is a direct consequence of the center manifold theorems and the stable manifold theorems ; we omit the proof .",
    "let the conditions ( [ 5.4 ] ) and ( [ 5.5 ] ) hold true .",
    "then , the system ( [ 5.1 ] ) must have a transition from @xmath29 , and there is a neighborhood @xmath30 of @xmath31 such that the transition is one of the following three types :    * continuous transition : there exists an open and dense set @xmath32 such that for any @xmath33 , the solution @xmath34 of ( [ 5.1 ] ) satisfies @xmath35 * jump transition : for any @xmath36 with some @xmath37 , there is an open and dense set @xmath38 such that for any @xmath39 , @xmath40 * mixed transition : for any @xmath36 with some @xmath37 , @xmath41 can be decomposed into two open sets @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 not necessarily connected ) : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , such that @xmath47    with this theorem in our disposal , we are in position to give a new dynamic classification scheme for dynamic phase transitions .    the phase transitions for ( [ 5.1 ] ) at @xmath48 is classified using their dynamic properties : continuous , jump , and mixed as given in theorem  [ t5.1 ] , which are called type - i , type - ii and type - iii respectively .",
    "an important aspect of the transition theory is to determine which of the three types of transitions given by theorem [ t5.1 ] occurs in a specific problem .",
    "a corresponding dynamic transition has been developed recently by the authors for this purpose ; see @xcite .",
    "we refer interested readers to these references for details of the theory .",
    "hereafter we recall a few related theorems in this theory used in this article .",
    "first , we remark here that one crucial ingredient for applications of this general dynamic transition theory is the reduction of ( [ 5.1 ] ) to the center manifold function .",
    "in fact , by this reduction , we know that the type of transitions for ( [ 5.1 ] ) at @xmath49 is completely dictated by its reduction equation near @xmath48 : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , and @xmath52 here @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath55 are the eigenvectors of @xmath27 and @xmath56 respectively corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath57 as in ( [ 5.4 ] ) , @xmath58 is the @xmath59 order jordan matrix corresponding to the eigenvalues given by ( [ 5.4 ] ) , and @xmath60 is the center manifold function of ( [ 5.1 ] ) near @xmath25 .",
    "second , let ( [ 5.1 ] ) be a gradient - type equation . under the conditions ( [ 5.4 ] ) and ( [ 5.5 ] ) , in a neighborhood @xmath30 of @xmath31 , the center manifold @xmath61 in @xmath41 at @xmath48 consists of three subsets @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the stable set , @xmath64 is the unstable set , and @xmath65 is the hyperbolic set of ( [ 5.7 ] )",
    ". then we have the following theorem .",
    "let ( [ 5.1 ] ) be a gradient - type equation , and the conditions ( [ 5.4 ] ) and ( [ 5.5 ] ) hold true .",
    "if @xmath31 is an isolated singular point of ( [ 5.1 ] ) at @xmath21 , then we have the following assertions :    * the transition of ( [ 5.1 ] ) at @xmath66 is continuous if and only if @xmath31 is locally asymptotically stable at @xmath48 , i.e. , the center manifold is stable : @xmath67",
    ". moreover , ( [ 5.1 ] ) bifurcates from @xmath49 to minimal attractors consisting of singular points of ( [ 5.1 ] ) . *",
    "if the stable set @xmath63 of ( [ 5.1 ] ) has no interior points in @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath68 , then the transition is jump .",
    "third , we also a dynamic transition theorem of ( [ 5.1 ] ) from a simple critical eigenvalue , which has been used in analyzing pvt systems and the ferromagnetic systems @xcite .",
    "we refer the interested readers to these references for details for this theorem .      in this section",
    ", we recall a new time - dependent ginzburg - landau theory for modeling equilibrium phase transitions in statistical physics .",
    "consider a thermal system with a control parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the classical le chtelier principle amounts to saying that for a stable equilibrium state of a system @xmath69 , when the system deviates from @xmath69 by a small perturbation or fluctuation , there will be a resuming force to restore this system to return to the stable state @xmath69 . by the mathematical characterization of gradient systems and the le chtelier principle , for a system with thermodynamic potential @xmath70 ,",
    "the governing equations are essentially determined by the functional @xmath70 . when the order parameters @xmath71 are nonconserved variables , i.e. , the integers @xmath72 then the time - dependent equations are given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the variational derivative ,",
    "@xmath75 and @xmath76 satisfy @xmath77 the condition ( [ 7.31 ] ) is required by the le chtelier principle . in the concrete problem , the terms @xmath76 can be determined by physical laws and ( [ 7.31 ] ) .",
    "we remark here that following the le chtelier principle , one should have an inequality constraint .",
    "however physical systems often obey most simplified rules , as many existing models for specific problems are consistent with the equality constraint here .",
    "this remark applies to the constraint ( [ 7.37 ] ) below as well .",
    "when the order parameters are the number density and the system has no material exchange with the external , then @xmath78 @xmath79 are conserved , i.e. , @xmath80 this conservation law requires a continuity equation @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the flux of component @xmath78 .",
    "in addition , @xmath83 satisfy @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the chemical potential of component @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 is a function depending on the other components @xmath89 @xmath90 .",
    "thus , from ( [ 7.33])-([7.35 ] ) we obtain the dynamical equations as follows @xmath91   & &   \\text { for } 1 \\le j \\le m,\\\\ & \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n}|_{\\partial\\omega}=0,\\ \\ \\ \\",

    "the above model covers the classical cahn - hilliard model .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for multi - component systems , these @xmath99 play an important rule in deriving good time - dependent models .",
    "if the order parameters @xmath100 are coupled to the conserved variables @xmath101 , then the dynamical equations are @xmath102 & & \\text { for } k+1 \\le j \\le m,\\\\ & \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial n}|_{\\partial\\omega}=0\\ \\ \\ \\ ( \\text{or}\\ u_i|_{\\partial\\omega}=0 ) & & \\text { for } 1 \\le i \\le k,\\\\ & \\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial n}|_{\\partial\\omega}=0,\\ \\ \\ \\",

    "the model ( [ 7.38 ] ) we derive here gives a general form of the governing equations to thermodynamic phase transitions , and will play crucial role in studying the dynamics of equilibrium phase transition in statistic physics .",
    "@xmath3he was first liquidized at @xmath103 and @xmath104(pa ) by karmerlingh onnes in 1908 . in 1938",
    ", p.l.kapitza found that when the temperature @xmath105 decreases below @xmath106 , the liquid @xmath3he will transit from normal liquid state to superfluid state , in which the fluid possesses zero viscosity i.e. , the viscous coefficient @xmath107 .",
    "the liquids with @xmath107 are called the superfluids , and the flow without drag is called the superfluidity .",
    "the superfluid transition is called @xmath2-phase transition , and its phase diagram is illustrated by figure [ f8.33 ] .",
    "the order parameter describing superfluidity is characterized by a non vanishing complex valued function @xmath108 as in the superconductivity , originating from quantum bose - einstein condensation . in the two - fluid hydrodynamic theory of super - fluidity , the density @xmath109 of @xmath3he is given by @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the superfluid density and @xmath112 the normal fluid density .",
    "the square @xmath113 is proportional to @xmath111 , and without loss of generality , we take @xmath114 as @xmath115    based on the quantum mechanics , @xmath116 represents the momentum associated with the bose - einstein condensation . hence , the free energy density contains the term @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the planck constant , and @xmath119 the mass of atom @xmath3he .",
    "meanwhile the superfluid state does not obey the classical thermodynamic laws , which the normal liquid state obeys .",
    "therefore , in the free energy density , @xmath114 satisfies the ginzburg - landau expansion @xmath120 systems @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we ignore the entropy , and consider the coupling action of @xmath114 and @xmath112 , i.e. , add the term @xmath121 in the free energy density . thus the ginzburg - landau free energy for liquid @xmath3he near the superfluid transition is given by @xmath122dx .",

    "it is clear that @xmath243 where @xmath244 are as in figure [ f8.34](c ) .",
    "hence , by theorem [ t5.1 ] , ( [ 8.207 ] ) have a transition at @xmath237 .",
    "by @xmath245 , the first eigenvalue of ( [ 8.207 ] ) is simple , and its eigenvector is given by @xmath246    the reduced equation of ( [ 8.207 ] ) on the center manifold reads @xmath247 where @xmath248 is the center manifold function . by ( [ 8.207 ] )",
    ", @xmath118 can be expressed as @xmath249 thus the reduced equation of ( [ 8.207 ] ) is given by @xmath250 where @xmath96 is as in ( [ 8.221 - 1 ] ) .",
    "the theorem follows from ( [ 8.222 ] ) and theorem [ t5.3 ] .    by the nondimensional form",
    ", we see that @xmath251 where @xmath252 is the coupled coefficient of @xmath112 and @xmath111 .",
    "physically , @xmath252 is small in comparison with @xmath253 ; namely @xmath254 on the other hand , we know that @xmath255 where @xmath204 is as in ( [ 8.219 ] )",
    ". therefore we deduce that there exists a pressure @xmath256 such that @xmath257 thus , when the transition pressure @xmath258 is below some value @xmath259 the superfluid transition is of the second order , i.e. , is continuous with the dynamic classification scheme , and when @xmath259 the superfluid transition is the first order , i.e. , is jump in the dynamic classification scheme .",
    "the proof is complete .",
    "as we know , the classical phase transition is illustrated by figure  [ f8.33 ] . in this phase diagram ,",
    "the coexistence curve @xmath203 separates the solid state and the superfluid state ( liquid he ii ) , and the curve @xmath173 is the coexistence curve between the superfluid state ( liquid he ii ) and the normal fluid state ( liquid he i ) , and the critical point is the triple - point .",
    "it is considered by the classical theory that the transition crossing @xmath173 is second order in the ehrenfest sense ( type - i with the dynamic classification scheme ) .",
    "however , in the phase transition diagram figure  [ f8.36 ] derived based on theorems  [ t8.14 - 1 ] and [ t8.14 ] , there is a unstable region @xmath0 , where both solid and liquid he ii states appear randomly depending on fluctuations .",
    "the point @xmath1 is a _ switch point _ where the transitions , between superfluid state ( liquid he ii ) and the normal fluid state ( liquid he i ) , changes from first order ( type ii with the dynamic classification scheme ) to second order ( type - i ) ; namely , the transition crossing @xmath260 is second order ( type - ii ) and the transition crossing @xmath261 is first order ( type - i ) .    in summary ,",
    "the results in this article predict the existence of the unstable region @xmath0 and the existence of the switch point @xmath1 .",
