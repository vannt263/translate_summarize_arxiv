    "spacetime singularity at the beginning of universe is a problem of great importance in standard cosmology . according to singularity theorem proved by hawking and penrose@xcite",
    ", a spacetime singularity must be appeared in finite past .",
    "since the appearance of singularity means breakdown of classical gravitational theory , one may expect that fundamental theory beyond general relativity ( gr ) , i.e. , quantum theory of gravity , resolves the problem of infiniteness .",
    "a lot of attempts to resolve the singularity at the beginning of universe have been proposed based on extension of gr@xcite , e.g. , superstring theory@xcite , loop quantum gravity@xcite , causal dynamical triangulation@xcite and gravity with non - local operator@xcite .",
    "regardless those efforts , the dynamics of very early universe is still unclear . because we have not achieved complete theory of quantum gravity , yet .",
    "recently , a gravitational theory attracts attention as a candidate for quantum gravity , which is called hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) theory@xcite .",
    "the theory is characterized by lifshitz scaling@xcite which is an anisotropic scaling of spacetime : @xmath0 and @xmath1 with dynamical exponent @xmath2 .",
    "if we set @xmath3 , all types of ultraviolet divergence via feynman diagrams can be suppressed in four - dimensional spacetime@xcite .",
    "it means that gravitational interaction can be renormalized by adding appropriate counterterms .",
    "thus , the renormalizable gravitational action is composed of second order time derivatives and up to sixth order spacial derivatives .    based on hl theory ,",
    "ultraviolet spacetime structures have been discussed such as black hole solutions with universal horizon which is a causal boundary for superluminal propagating modes@xcite . in particular ,",
    "singularity avoidance is an intriguing subject for study .",
    "we expect that quantum gravitational theory resolves spacetime singularities in classical theory of gravity .",
    "the key point to avoid spacetime singularity is violating null energy condition .",
    "as indicated in @xcite , in friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) spacetime with non - zero spacial curvature , higher spacial curvature terms in action avoid evolving into singularity .",
    "namely , @xmath4 and @xmath3 terms mimic  dark radiation \" and  dark stiff matter \" , respectively .",
    "since the energy densities of these effective matter components depend on coupling constants in the theory , null energy condition can be violated if the values of coupling constants are arbitrary . as a result",
    ", we can find bouncing universe and oscillating universe as singularity - free solutions@xcite .",
    "although the cosmological singularity avoidance can be realized via higher spacial curvatures as ultraviolet modification of gravity , one may consider such solutions show unstable behavior .",
    "more specifically , it may possible that the effective matter components derived from @xmath5 lifshitz scaling terms make spacetime unstable because of violation of the energy condition .",
    "it is reasonable that the spacetime around planck scale is perturbed by quantum fluctuation of gravity .",
    "thus , to examine the spacetime stabilities of these singularity - free solutions is indispensable in order to construct a cosmological scenario without initial singularity .    in the paper @xcite ,",
    "dynamics of bianchi type ix spacetime , i.e. , spacially homogeneous closed cosmological model , is discussed . in other words , the effect of spacetime anisotropy to singularity - free solutions in closed flrw spacetime is examined . from the result , it is found that the stability against small anisotropic perturbation depends on the coupling constants of the theory .",
    "thus , we expect that the dynamics of the other types of perturbations are also affected by the coupling constants .",
    "since hl theory is renormalizable , the values of coupling constants at planck scale can be evaluated via beta functions from renormalization group , in principle .",
    "if we obtain the values of coupling constants in ultraviolet regime , we may predict the dynamics of our universe at very early stage , which can not directly observed .",
    "thus , we set the goal of this paper to show the stability conditions for singularity - free cosmological solutions against linear order perturbation not only anisotropic modes but also inhomogeneity ones .",
    "the perturbation analysis in flrw spacetime in the context of hl theory had been discussed . without spacial curvature",
    ", there is quite a lot of study , e.g. , primordial perturbation@xcite , stability of scalar perturbation@xcite and stability of de sitter spacetime@xcite . turning our attention to the case including non - zero spacial curvature ,",
    "the analyses of scalar perturbation have been performed . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors show scalar perturbation in vacuum flrw spacetime , and in @xcite , dynamics of scalar field in bouncing universe is discussed . recalling our motivation to investigate spacetime stabilities of singularity - free solutions ,",
    "it is necessary to see dynamics of tensor and vector degree of freedoms as well as scalar ones .",
    "thus , in this paper , we perform perturbation analysis regarding tensor , vector and scalar modes based on projectable hl theory .",
    "although non - projectable hl theory which is infrared completion of projectable hl theory has been proposed@xcite , its renormalizablity is still unclear",
    ". therefore we focus only on the projectable case because of the renormalizable characteristic .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ flrw_hl ] , we briefly review projectable hl theory , especially in flrw background with non - zero spacial curvature .",

    "since we have imposed the projectability condition , i.e. , @xmath43 , the hamiltonian constraint takes the following form : @xmath44 namely , the hamiltonian constraint turns to be a global condition instead of local one .",

    "then , we derive the friedmann - like equation by considering the structure of the basic equations in flrw spacetime .",
    "note that the friedmann equation ( and matter conservation law ) basically generates the dynamical equation of the scale factor by differentiating with respect to time .",

    "additionally , we have investigated backreaction from perturbation on background geometry , especially , against anisotropic perturbation in @xmath158}$ ] type solution . considering bianchi type ix spacetime with small anisotropy",
    ", the modified friedmann - like equation including backreaction from the anisotropic perturbation can be derived as ( [ h_ix ] ) .",
    "it is found that the energy for the scale factor is lifted up by anisotropic perturbation .",
    "thus , the universe can evolve into the singularity if the potential barrier between @xmath185 and @xmath443 is sufficiently small .",
    "we also pointed out that the anisotropic energy tend to be large if the bouncing radius is small , because the oscillating amplitudes of @xmath412 are enhanced .",
    "we would like to stress that the bouncing solutions in open flrw spacetime tend to be unstable for the following reasons : ( i ) the stability conditions for tensor perturbation basically contradicts to bouncing conditions .",
    "intuitively , @xmath444 and @xmath230 are preferred to satisfy @xmath126 for any @xmath222 and viable @xmath91 .",
    "however , we can not find any types of bouncing solution in open flrw spacetime under such a condition .",
    "thus , a certain level of tuning of the other coupling constants is required .",
    "( ii ) in infrared regime , the hubble friction which is significant to suppress tachyon instabilities in scalar perturbation tend to be weak . in closed flrw spacetime , the minimum value of @xmath441 can be converged to zero if @xmath17 approaches to unity via renormalization group flow . however , in open flrw spacetime , we have to constrain @xmath445 to avoid ghost instabilities .",
    "our conclusion is that we have shown that non - singular cosmological solutions in non - flat flrw spacetime can be stable against tensor and scalar perturbation , at least at the linear level .",
    "since projectable hl theory is proved to be truly renormalizable in perturbation approach , we can calculate the values of the coupling constants via beta functions from renormalization group , in principle .",
    "thus , it may be possible that the beginning of our universe can be predicted based on well - known perturbative quantization approach .    in our case ,",
    "i.e. , hl theory under projectability condition , it is indispensable to consider accelerating expanding phase after bounce in order to suppress the effect of negative squared mass of scalar perturbation in infrared regime .",
    "we speculate that the scalar instabilities in infrared regime is the nature of projectable hl gravity theory .",
    "this infrared pathological behavior is conceivably resolved by considering extended theory , i.e. , non - projectable hl gravity whose scalar graviton can be stable at least in minkowski spacetime .",
    "we additionally mention that infrared limit of non - projectable hl theory ( i.e. , without higher spacial curvatures ) is included within the framework of horndeski theory which is the general theory of ghost - free scalar - tensor gravity@xcite . based on horndeski theory",
    ", it turns out that any non - singular cosmological solution is unstable@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is worth mentioning that the no - go theorem for the stable non - singular solution can be violated if the extended theory including higher spacial curvatures is considered@xcite .",
