    "@xmath73 is an affinely parametrized , inextendible null geodesic in @xmath59 to which every inextendible null geodesics may be mapped by an isometry .",
    "thus @xmath56 itself admits no complete null geodesic .    to see that @xmath56 is conformally einstein , let @xmath74 denote minkowski space and consider the mapping @xmath75 given by @xmath76 @xmath77 is a conformal diffeomorphism of @xmath59 onto the minkowski upper half - space @xmath78 with its flat ` vacuum ' metric @xmath79 , since @xmath80 .",
    "note that our standard photon is mapped to @xmath81 , which is inextendible on @xmath82 and has the ( incomplete ) affine reparametrization @xmath83 .",
