    "direct extraction of the dressed quark - gluon vertex functions from lattice simulations is not straight forward , as form factors associated with the longitudinal and transverse components have been obtained in lattice simulations for different kinematic configurations , yet the range of space - like momenta on the lattice is rather limited and their use in numerical dse applications is currently impracticable .",

    "from table  [ table1 ] it is clear that for @xmath52  gev and @xmath53 the mass values of the exited states @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are in better agreement with the average experimental data than for @xmath45  gev .",
    "however , the interaction with @xmath53 and @xmath57  gev does not yield acceptable decay constants and overestimates the masses of the ground states .",
    "a better interaction candidate may be found in the choice @xmath52  gev and @xmath58 , yet we encounter numerical complications for these parameter values when we solve the dse in the complex plane . for the time",
    "being this does impede the computation of the masses of radial resonances .",
    "nonetheless , this problem can be overcome by using a nakanishi representation of the propagators .",
    "the choice @xmath52  gev is also motivated by the fact that the maris - tandy model  @xcite adequately reproduces experimental bottonium spectroscopy with the interaction parameters tuned to @xmath59  gev@xmath60 and @xmath61  gev  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly significant since for heavy flavorless mesons the rl approximation is appropriate and flavor effects in the effective coupling strength should be minimal in this case .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we depict the effective coupling strength of ref .",
    "@xcite for three values of @xmath62 and @xmath58 fixed . in there",
    ", some common qualitative features may be appreciated ; note in particular that the effective interaction is finite in the infrared . on the other hand",
    ", meson spectroscopy does not allow to draw general conclusions about the finiteness of the interaction .",
    "modern dse and lattice - qcd studies find that the gluon propagator is a bounded , regular function of spacelike momenta , which achieves its maximum value on this domain at @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it is necessary to establish whether the vertex possesses some structure which can qualitatively alter this behavior as the effective interaction depends on the product of gluon propagator and vertex dressing functions . in general",
    ", it is quite difficult to put absolute constraints on @xmath64 in the range @xmath65  gev .",
    "however , once @xmath64 is fixed the best values for the masses of the radial resonances correspond to a broader distribution in momentum space or equivalently larger values of @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "taking also into account that a broader distribution with a less pronounced peak is also required to reproduce the heavy - quarkonia spectrum , this suggests that a suitable interaction for a wide range of applications beyond the rl ought to have a strong and broad support concentrated at about @xmath66  gev@xmath60 .",
    "a deeper insight is gained from the lattice data by inspection of the functional behavior of @xmath11 .",
    "all the solutions for @xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are consistent with the lattice data for @xmath34 and @xmath35 as can be seen in fig .  13 of ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "however , it also becomes clear from fig .",
    "14 in the same reference that _ only _ when one solves the quark dse with an infrared enhanced form factor @xmath67 , the values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 become consistent with lattice qcd data at low momenta .",
    "this suggests an inflection of @xmath67 towards a finite limit for @xmath68  gev@xmath60 .",
    "therefore , even though lattice data for the dressed - quark wave and mass functions do not strongly enough constrain the infrared behavior of @xmath11 in the dse inversion process , we find that requiring consistency between the dse solutions and lattice qcd results provides a valuable source of information and constraints on the infrared domain .",
    "by comparing experimental data on the pseudoscalar meson mass spectrum with realistic model calculations in the rl approximation , one deduces that the data prefer a broader distribution in momentum space for the effective coupling strength  @xcite , @xmath2 , rather than a localized and sharply peaked interaction .",
    "an effective interaction extracted from lattice qcd data on the quark propagator is consonant with such a distribution and also points at an infrared - finite limit of @xmath2 .",
    "self - consistency requires thus an infrared - finite functional behavior of @xmath67 . nonetheless , in order to go a step further in finding an interaction ansatz valid for a wide range of mesonic observables",
    ", one may need to resort to a more realistic quark gluon - vertex interaction and take into account the important structure of its transverse components . in the past two decades",
    ", some progress in this direction has been made  @xcite and phenomenological models should be extended to beyond the rl approximation using the guidelines of these studies as well as other input , such as the one proposed in the present study .",
