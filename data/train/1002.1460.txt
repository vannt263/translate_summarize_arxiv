    "in this paper we generalize an idea first mentioned by sadun in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that given a connected group @xmath1 and a manifold @xmath8 , the moduli space of flat connections on the trivial principal bundle @xmath0 is isomorphic to the _ representation variety _ @xmath2 , where the quotient is by conjugation .",
    "when @xmath1 is abelian , this reduces to @xmath9 , so we restrict attention to non - abelian @xmath1 . working on tiling spaces , we consider flat , pattern equivariant ( pe ) connections on the trivial principal bundle @xmath10 , modulo pe gauge transformations and call this the _ pe representation variety _ of the tiling @xmath3 .",
    "then , by considering these pe connections as pullbacks of zero curvature connections on the approximants @xmath6 , it is not hard to see that the pe representation variety of the tiling @xmath3 is the direct limit @xmath5 , where @xmath11 is the dual of the forgetful map between the approximants @xmath6 .",
    "the original definition was for connected lie groups , but calculation of this direct limit is easiest when the group @xmath1 is finite and hence disconnected . in section [ examples ] , we take @xmath12 and calculate it for the period doubling tiling and its double cover , the thue - morse tiling .",
    "this calculation shows that , even though these two tiling spaces have the same cohomology , the pe representation variety distinguishes them .",
    "the computer algebra program magma can be used to calculate @xmath13 for any finitely generated free group @xmath14 and symmetric group @xmath1 , which will be a lot of help in complicated examples .",
    "the relevant instructions on how to implement this on magma is given after the examples . in order to make the generalization to finite groups",
    ", we change the definition of the pe representation variety by defining it not in terms of connections but in terms of bundles .",
    "we call it @xmath15 and define it in [ prep ] .",
    "we use @xmath16 in the definitions but the generalization to @xmath4 is immediate . using this definition , the main result of the paper is proved in section [ mainresult ] :    [ datheorem ] let @xmath3 be a tiling space and @xmath17 , @xmath18 be its ghler approximants . let @xmath19 be an increasing sequence and @xmath20 be the forgetful map where @xmath21 is bigger than @xmath22 . then , @xmath23    once the right definitions have been chosen , many of the proofs are immediate ( and frequently omitted ) .",
    "the sections before [ mainresult ] work toward the proof of this result . in section [ invariance ]",
    "we show the invariance of the pe representation variety under homeomorphisms of tiling spaces using a theorem of rand @xcite .",
    "a finer invariant can be obtained without modding out by @xmath1 in the direct limit . to achieve this",
    ", we consider only based bundles in the definition of @xmath15 and call it the @xmath24 .",
    "this is the definition in [ basedbundle ] and in section [ gamma ] we have    [ datheorem2 ] let @xmath3 be a tiling space and @xmath17 , @xmath18 be its ghler approximants .",
    "let @xmath19 be an increasing sequence and @xmath20 be the forgetful map where @xmath21 is bigger than @xmath22 .",
    "then , @xmath25",
    "for both of the examples below , the approximants of the tilings are the wedge of two circles .",
    "hence their fundamental group is the free group on two generators , @xmath26 . in both examples ,",
    "our group @xmath1 will be the simplest non - abelian group , that is the dihedral group of order 6 : @xmath27 .",
    "so we need to calculate @xmath28 and the only difference in the two examples will be the forgetful map in the direct limit .",
    "a two page hand calculation shows that    @xmath29    where @xmath30 denotes the conjugacy class of a homomorphism which takes one generator of @xmath26 to @xmath31 and the other to @xmath32 in @xmath7 .      the substitution rule for the thue - morse tiling is given by @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the dual of the forgetful map @xmath35 is the substitution map itself thought of as a homomorphism from @xmath26 to @xmath7 .",
    "we have to trace each of the 11 elements of @xmath28 and see which ones are identified .",
    "a typical calculation goes as follows : @xmath36 a similar calculation with the other generator gives @xmath37 .",
    "hence @xmath38 is mapped to @xmath39 in the direct limit .",
    "repeating this for all the other elements shows that    @xmath40      the substitution rule for the period doubling tiling is given by @xmath41 , @xmath42 . a similar calculation to the above shows that    @xmath43    comparing the two direct limits , we see that it differentiates between the period doubling and its double cover , the thue - morse tiling space .",
    "this is the simplest topological invariant that tells them apart .      for any finitely",
    "generated free group f and symmetric group s , we will give instructions for how to compute @xmath44 using the computer algebra program magma .",
    "the example we give is for a free group generated by two elements and symmetric group of order six but the generalization is trivial . after each step below hit the _",
    "enter _ key ( the semi - colon is typed into command line too ) .    1 .",
    "define the free group : f:=freegroup(2 ) ; 2 .",
    "define the symmetric group : s:=symmetricgroup(3 ) ; 3 .",
    "calculate @xmath44 : rv:= homomorphisms(f , s : surjective : = false ) ; 4 .   show the cardinality of @xmath45 : # homs ;    after these steps , the command line should return  11  , which was the result we obtained in the examples above .",
    "the idea of modifying cohomology to obtain pe cohomology so that it is applicable to tilings was first given by kellendonk and putnam in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use the same idea in the category of bundles .",
    "one can intuitively picture a @xmath1-bundle as a geometric object ( say an interval ) glued to itself along another geometric object ( say a circle ) but with a twist dictated by the group @xmath1 .",
    "the intuitive idea behind pe bundles over a tiling @xmath3 is that this twist should also depend on the patterns in the tiling @xmath3 .",
    "that is , if two points have the same pattern of tiles up to a certain range around them , them we should invoke the same group element which will dictate the twisting .",
    "for this we need the following definitions :    an open set @xmath46 of @xmath16 is said to be a _ pe open set with radius @xmath47 _ if for every @xmath48 it contains all @xmath49 such that @xmath50-x = [ b_t(y)]-y$ ] , where @xmath50 $ ] is the patch of the tiling @xmath3 containing the ball @xmath51 with center @xmath31 and radius @xmath52 .",

    "the following diagram is commutative :    u_j f & ^_j & ^-1(u_j ) + & _ p_1 & _ + & & u_j    the pairs @xmath62 are called _ charts _ as usual .",

    "a function @xmath63 is called a _ pe function with radius @xmath52 _ if for any @xmath64 such that @xmath50-x=[b_t(y)]-y$ ] , we have @xmath65 .",

    ", we also have the fact that a refinement of a trivializing neighborhoods is also a trivializing neighborhood .",
    "hence , given two pe g - bundles , we can assume that they have the same pe open cover by looking at the intersection of their covers .",

    "notice that if @xmath56 is a pe bundle with radius @xmath52 over @xmath3 then it is also a pe bundle for any radius @xmath89 which is bigger than @xmath52 .",

    "then , multiplying the constant transition functions for each intersection @xmath266 we get a map @xmath267 where @xmath268 . by the co - cycle condition it is easy to see that this map does nt depend on the choice of `` _ _ middle _ _ '' open sets ; that is , the open sets indexed from @xmath269 to @xmath270 , but it depends on the choice of initial and final open sets .    using the co - cycle condition and the simply connectedness of @xmath127 we can show that @xmath146 is independent of the path chosen to connect @xmath91 and @xmath259 as follows : let @xmath271 be another curve connecting these two points .",
    "since these curves bound a compact region , we can fill it with finitely many open chart sets whose union contain the curves and the region they are bounding . construct a local homotopy using three sets at a time and begin by perturbing the initial curve to a curve @xmath159 as in the figure . by the simply connectedness of @xmath127",
