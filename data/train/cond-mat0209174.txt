    "has been gathered over the past twenty years to show that the evolution of statistical properties in simple reaction diffusion systems in low dimensions is anomalous , in the sense that it does not follow the corresponding mean field equations ( see @xcite for a short review ) . in low enough dimensions , in the instances where an exact solution is lacking ,",
    "there are no formal methods by which the exponents characterizing the different physical quantities may be calculated .",
    "the renormalization group method ( see @xcite for a review ) provides the only systematic way to calculate these exponents and thus understand fluctuation - dominated kinetics in reaction - diffusion systems . in this paper",
    ", we consider the model of irreversible aggregation of diffusing , massive particles @xmath9 , in dimensions @xmath2 , and use the renormalization group method to calculate the small mass ( @xmath10 ) behavior of @xmath11 , the mean density of particles of mass @xmath12 at time @xmath13 .",
    "as we explain later in this section , this problem of determining @xmath11 requires using the full power of the renormalization group method .",
    "this is unlike many other problems where just considering the rate equations with a renomalised reaction rate @xmath14 is enough to obtain the right answer .",
    "we now give a more precise definition of the cluster - cluster aggregation ( cca ) model @xmath15 and review earlier relevant results .",

    "however , at finite times there is a well defined average mass distribution @xmath11 which is of interest to determine",
    ". it will be shown later ( see the text following eq .",

    "it was shown in @xcite , that the problem of finding all correlation functions of the local mass distribution is equivalent to finding all moments of the following stochastic integro - differential equation ( stochastic smoluchowski equation ) : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a convolution term , @xmath61 is gaussian white noise and @xmath62 , is the local particle density .",
