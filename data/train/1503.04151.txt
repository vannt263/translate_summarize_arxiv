    "the idea of creating a coherent state for a quantum system was first proposed by schrdinger , in 1926 , in connection with the classical states of the quantum harmonic oscillator ; he referred to them as states of the minimum uncertainty product @xcite .",
    "almost forty years later in 1963 , glauber @xcite introduced the field coherent states , these have been realized experimentally with the development of lasers , and can be obtained from any one of three mathematical definitions : ( i ) as the right - hand eigenstates of the boson annihilation operator @xmath0 , with @xmath1 being a complex number ; ( ii ) as the states obtained by application of the displacement operator @xmath2 upon the vacuum state ; and ( iii ) as those states with a minimum uncertainty relationship @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 the position and momentum operators respectively and @xmath6 .",
    "the same states are obtained from any one of the three mathematical definitions when one makes use of the harmonic oscillator algebra . at the same time",
    ", klauder @xcite developed a set of continuous states in which the basic ideas of coherent states for arbitrary lie groups were contained .",
    "the complete construction of coherent states of lie groups was achieved by perelomov @xcite and gilmore @xcite almost ten years later ; the basic theme of this development was to connect the coherent states with the dynamical group for each physical problem thus allowing the generalization of the concept of coherent state . for systems",
    "far from the ground state or with a finite number of bound states , the harmonic oscillator algebra is no longer adequate , therefore there has arisen an interest in generalizing the concept of coherent state for systems with different dynamical properties .",
    "nieto and simmons @xcite generalized the notion of coherent states for potentials having unequally spaced energy levels .",
    "their construction is such that the resultant states are localized , follow the classical motion and disperse as little as possible in time .",
    "their coherent states are defined as those which minimize the uncertainty relation equation .",
    "they constructed coherent states for the pschl - teller potential , the harmonic oscillator with a centripetal barrier and the morse potential .",
    "gazeau and klauder @xcite proposed a generalization for systems with one degree of freedom possessing discrete and continuous spectra .",
    "these states present continuity of labeling , resolution of unity , and temporal stability .",
    "the key point is to parametrize such states by means of two real values : an amplitude @xmath7 and a phase @xmath8 , instead of using a complex value @xmath1 .",
    "manko and collaborators @xcite introduced coherent states of a _ f - deformed _ algebra as eigenstates of a deformed annihilation operator @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the usual annihilation operator of the harmonic oscillator algebra and @xmath11 is a number operator function that specifies the potential .",
    "these states present nonclassical properties such as squeezing and anti - bunching .",
    "more recently , they generalized the displacement operator method for the case of _ f - deformed _ oscillators introducing a deformed version of the displacement operator @xcite with the disadvantage that it is non unitary and does not displace the deformed operators in the usual form .    on the basis of the f - deformed oscillator formalism , in previous works we put forward the construction of generalized coherent states for nonlinear systems by selecting a specific deformation function in a way such",
    "that the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian it seeks to describe is similar to that of a f - deformed hamiltonian . in this regard , we examined the trigonometric and the modified pschl - teller potentials , as well as the morse potential , all of them containing linear and quadratic terms in the number operator @xcite .",
    "in addition to these , a harmonic oscillator with an inverse square potential in two dimensions was also considered @xcite .",
    "coherent states have been applied not only in optics but in many fields of physics , for instance , in the study of the forced harmonic oscillator @xcite , quantum oscillators @xcite , quantum nondemolition measurements @xcite , nonequilibrium statistical mechanics@xcite , and atomic and molecular physics @xcite .",
    "excellent reviews can be found in @xcite . + the paper is organized as follows . in section [ harmonic ]",
    "we briefly describe the properties of the usual coherent states . in section [ deformed ]",
    "we present a methodology to construct deformed hamiltonians for specific systems . in section [ nlcs ]",
    "we give two alternative forms to obtain the coherent states pertinent to a nonlinear hamiltonian . and finally , in section [ res ] we present some numerical results .",
    "the harmonic oscillator coherent states , also called _ field coherent states _",
    "@xcite , are quantum states of minimum uncertainty product which most closely resemble the classical ones in the sense that they remain well localized around their corresponding classical trajectory .",
    "when one makes use of the harmonic oscillator algebra , the same coherent states are obtained from the three glauber s mathematical definitions mentioned above .",
    "such states take the following form in terms of the number state basis :    @xmath12    where @xmath1 is an arbitrary complex number . for every complex number @xmath13 the coherent state @xmath14 has a non zero projection on every fock state @xmath15 .    from a statistical point of view , it follows from the above that the occupation number distribution of a coherent state , @xmath16 , is characterized by a poisson distribution : @xmath17 with an average occupation number @xmath18 and mean square root deviation @xmath19 such states are not orthogonal , and the overlap between two of them is given by @xmath20 moreover , they form an over - complete basis with the closure relationship , @xmath21 so that any state of the group generated by the operators @xmath10 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be expanded in terms of coherent states .",
