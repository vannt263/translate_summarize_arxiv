    "a wide variety of materials can be driven into a non  equilibrium state that is either solid  like and static , or fluid  like but only relaxes on time scales that far exceed the experimental time frame , if at all .",
    "such states are often referred to as ` jammed , ' and are realisable in molecular liquids having undergone a rapid quench to low temperatures , or colloids at a high volume fraction , to cite just two examples  @xcite .",
    "it has recently been postulated by liu and nagel that the nature of the jammed state may be independent of the manner in which it was formed  @xcite .",
    "for example , a stress  induced jamming transition may produce a qualitatively similar state to a temperature  induced transition .",
    "this was expressed in the form of a ` jamming phase diagram , ' in which jammed configurations occupy a compact region near to the origin of a phase space comprised of three axes  : the temperature  @xmath12 , the volume  @xmath13 and the load  @xmath1  @xcite .    in its simplest form , the liu ",
    "nagel jamming phase diagram suggests that increasing the applied load can only increase the likelihood of flow .",
    "however , it is equally feasible for an applied load to induce a jammed state .",
    "for instance , if a pile of sand is formed and then gravity is switched off , the system unjams without any significant variation in volume .",
    "thus the the load ( here controlled by gravity ) jams the system .",
    "this concurs with the earlier claim that jammed systems may be classified as ` fragile '  that is , they can support only certain , _ compatible _ loads , and will rearrange or flow under an incompatible load  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one could also envisage a class of loadings that can alternately induce and destroy a jammed state as the magnitude of the load increases , a situation that could be referred to as ` re - entrant jamming . '",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the nature of transitions to or from jammed configurations that have , as their control parameter , the imposed shear stress  @xmath1 .",
    "we do this by providing concrete examples of models that exhibit jamming transitions with  @xmath1 , including instances of the re - entrant jamming scenario described above .",
    "these models are based on the ` soft glassy rheology ' ( sgr ) model of sollich _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which was originally devised to highlight the possible existence of glassy relaxation in a range of soft materials , such as foams , emulsions , pastes  _ etc .",
    "_ it is parameterised by an effective temperature  @xmath0 , which in in the context of soft matter is thought to represent some form of mechanical noise , but may refer to the true thermal temperature in other applications .",
    "as it was originally defined , the sgr model only exhibits shear thinning , which is clearly unsuitable for our purposes .",
    "therefore we consider variants of the model in which the effective temperature @xmath0 is no longer constant , but can vary with the state of the system .",
    "more precisely , @xmath0 is treated a function of both the global stress  @xmath1 and the local strain  @xmath2 , _ i.e. _  @xmath14 . by choosing suitable forms of  @xmath15",
    ", systems can be constructed that become ` colder ' as they become more stressed , which allows for the system to shear thicken and even ` jam . '    for clarity , we restrict our attention to two limiting forms of @xmath15 , namely @xmath5 and @xmath11 . in the former case ,",
    "certain classes of @xmath5 are shown to exhibit a flow curve ( _ i.e. _ the curve of the stress @xmath1 versus the strain rate @xmath4 under conditions of steady flow ) that is non  monotonic , and can touch the @xmath6 axis for range of finite values of  @xmath1 .",
    "thus a ` jammed ' state with @xmath16 can be reached for some @xmath1 but not for others .",
    "furthermore , it is also shown that , for systems driven by an imposed @xmath17 , whether or not a jammed configuration is approached at late times depends on the entire strain history of the system , and not just the behaviour of @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",
    "we refer to this phenomenon as ` history ",
    "dependent jamming . '",
    "the behaviour of systems with @xmath10 is somewhat different , but no less remarkable . when driven by an imposed  @xmath1 , certain forms of @xmath11 exhibit a regime in which the viscosity never reaches its steady flow value but oscillates in time , with a waveform that is approximately sinusoidal near to the transition point , but becomes increasingly sharp deep into the oscillatory regime .",
    "the models considered here are spatially homogeneous , and so this oscillation is purely temporal , having no spatial component .",
    "it is tempting to associate these oscillations with the stick  slip behaviour observed in granular systems and plate tectonics  @xcite , but we shall give reasons why we believe that the underlying physics might be rather different .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility of more complex oscillatory behaviour , maybe even chaotic , arising in as  of  yet unobserved regions of parameter space .",
    "the finding of a bifurcation to oscillatory behaviour for @xmath10 is all the more remarkable because the flow curve ( as already defined ) is everywhere monotonic increasing for this class of  @xmath0 .",
    "by contrast , instances of rheological instabilities that have been found experimentally have tended to occur for ranges of parameters in which the flow curve has a negative gradient  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that mechanism behind the instability observed here may be qualitatively different to those cited above , and may be realisable in some range of materials that has yet to be identified .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s : general ] the class of models to be studied is defined , with particular attention being paid to those aspects that differ from the sgr model .",
    "the known results of the sgr model that are relevant to the subsequent discussion are then briefly summarised in sec .",
    "[ s : sgr ] .",
    "systems with @xmath3 are described in sec .",
    "[ s : global ] , where it explained how the flow curves can be graphically interpreted as mappings from the sgr flow curves .",
    "dependent behaviour of the system has been found by numerical integration of the governing master equation .",
    "an example of history ",
    "dependent jamming is presented , and explained in terms of the stability of the steady flow solutions .    in sec .",
    "[ s : local ] we turn to consider the case @xmath10 , and analytically prove that the flow curve is everywhere monotonic .",
    "nonetheless , the simulations results presented here clearly show that @xmath19 can oscillate in time for a range of imposed stresses  @xmath1 . a qualitative explanation of the emergence of the oscillatory phase is also given , in terms of the model s internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the intensive nature of the simulations has meant that only a small range of functional forms for @xmath11 have been investigated , and hence it has not been possible to fully characterise this range of models .",
    "therefore we consider a simplified model in sec .",
    "[ s : monodisperse ] , for which the simulation times are significantly shorter and a more complete picture has been realised .",
    "some results of this model have also been presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "this reduced model clearly shows that the mean value of @xmath4 during the oscillatory motion deviates from the steady flow value by as much as an order of magnitude . finally , in sec .",
    "[ s : disc ] we discuss some outstanding issues raised by this work , before summarising our results in sec .  [ s : summ ] .",
    "all of the models studied in this paper represent generalisations of the sgr model of sollich _ et al . _",
    "it is therefore prudent to first describe those features that are common to this class of models , before considering each of the different generalisations in turn .",
    "this is the purpose of the current section .",
    "since the various assumptions that lie behind the construction of the sgr model have already been discussed at length elsewhere , we shall here give just a brief overview of the derivation and refer the reader to  @xcite for more detailed physical arguments .",
    "only those aspects that differ from the sgr model will be discussed in full .",
    "our goal is to construct deliberately simplified models that exhibit shear  thickening and jamming , but whose interpretation is more transparent than that of a detailed microscopic model . in this spirit , the models in this class all share a number of simplifications .",
    "only a single shear component of the strain and stress tensors are considered , which will be denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "this is therefore a class of _ scalar _ models .",
    "it is further assumed that the system can be coarse grained into a collection of mesoscopic subsystems , each of which are fully described by two scalar variables , namely a local strain @xmath2 and a stability parameter  @xmath20 .",
    "these mesoscopic subsystems will be referred to as _",
    "elements_. we simply assume here that such a coarse  graining is possible , notwithstanding the significant practical challenges in constructing a suitable scheme for any given microscopic model .    at any given instant ,",
    "each element has a probability of yielding per unit time that is denoted by  @xmath21 .",
    "when an element yields , it is assumed that its microscopic constituents are rearranged to such a degree that it loses all memory of its former configuration .",
    "its strain returns to zero , and it is assigned a new value of @xmath20 that is drawn from a _ prior _ distribution @xmath22 .",
    "suitable functional forms for @xmath23 and @xmath22 will be discussed below .",
    "the value of @xmath20 remains fixed until the element yields again , but @xmath2 follows the global strain @xmath7 according to @xmath24 .",
    "thus the elements are affinely deformed by the flow field , which is assumed to be homogeneous .",
    "let us define @xmath25 to be the probability density function of elements which have a local strain @xmath2 and a barrier @xmath20 at time  @xmath8 .",
    "then @xmath25 evolves in time according to two distinct mechanisms  : the homogeneous shearing at a rate  @xmath4 , and the yielding of elements at a rate of @xmath23 per unit time .",
    "thus the master equation for @xmath25 is    @xmath26    the second term on the left ",
    "hand side represents the increase in local strains @xmath2 according to the uniform global strain rate  @xmath4 .",
    "the right hand side describes the yielding of elements .",
    "the first term , which is negative , accounts for the loss of elements as they yield at a rate @xmath23 .",
    "conversely , the second term represents these same elements _ after _ they have yielded , which have a strain @xmath27 and a value of @xmath20 drawn from @xmath22 . the total rate of yielding @xmath28 is defined by    @xmath29    here we have introduced the notation that the angled brackets ` @xmath30 ' represents the instantaneous average of the given function over @xmath25 .",
    "this will be used frequently in what follows .",
    "the master equation ( [ e : master ] ) only describes the evolution of the strain degrees of freedom . to characterise the rheological response of the system",
    ", some relation must be found between the local strains @xmath2 and the global stress  @xmath1 .",
    "this involves two further assumptions .",
    "firstly , the elements are supposed to behave elastically between yield events , so that the local stress is just  @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a uniform elastic constant .",
    "secondly , @xmath1 is the arithmetic mean of the local stresses , or @xmath33 .",
    "other averaging procedures could be employed  @xcite , but we focus here on the simplest non  trivial option .",
    "although the local stress  strain relationship is elastic , the global stress also incorporates the yielding of elements and , as will be seen below , the @xmath1@xmath7 relationship is not a linear one .",
    "we have been unable to find an analytic solution to the master equation  ( [ e : master ] ) for any non ",
    "trivial  @xmath23 .",
    "instead it has been numerically integrated using the procedure summarised in appendix  [ s : numerics ] .",
    "however , it will sometimes be necessary to refer to the steady state solution for a constant  @xmath34 , which can be found exactly ,    @xmath35\\quad .",
    "\\label{e : st3}\\ ] ]    this is derived by setting @xmath36 in ( [ e : master ] ) and integrating the resulting first ",
    "order ordinary differential equation with respect to  @xmath2 .",
    "the asymptotic yield rate @xmath37 can be found by requiring that the integral of @xmath38 is unity .      in the sgr model , the yield rate @xmath23",
    "was assigned a functional form similar to that of an activated process  @xcite .",
    "this was based on the idea that each element can be represented by a single particle moving on a free energy landscape , which remains confined within a well of depth @xmath20 until random fluctuations allow it to cross over this barrier into a different well , with a new barrier  @xmath39 .",
    "thus yielding can be identified with barrier crossing .",
    "this description is similar to that of activated processes in thermodynamic systems ; however , the random fluctuations here are _ not necessarily _ due to the true thermodynamic temperature .",
    "they may arise rather from a form of homogeneous mechanical noise generated by non ",
    "linear couplings between the elements ; see @xcite for a fuller discussion on this point . to avoid possible confusion , this effective temperature is denoted by the symbol  @xmath0 rather than  @xmath12 .",
    "although the energy barrier of an element is initially  @xmath20 , as it becomes strained it will gain an elastic energy of @xmath40 and thus will have a smaller effective energy barrier @xmath41 .",
    "thus the yield rate will take the form    @xmath42\\quad , \\label{e : gamma}\\ ] ]    where the attempt rate @xmath43 sets the time scale of the yielding .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath0 is constant in the sgr model , and essentially acts as a parameter of the model .",
    "however , since @xmath0 may be generated in part by internal couplings between the elements , it should be allowed to vary with the state of the system , _ i.e. _ @xmath44 .    in this paper , we shall not consider the most general possible form for  @xmath0 , but",
    "shall instead focus on a more restricted class for which @xmath14 .",
    "this corresponds to the realisation that , as an element is strained , it may become more or less susceptible to the noise , and hence its ` temperature ' @xmath0 may change . allowing @xmath0 to also depend on @xmath1",
    "reflects that this change in susceptibility to noise may in part be a _",
    "phenomenon , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath0 of a given element may depend on the state of all of the elements around it . clearly , deriving the actual @xmath15 for",
    "any given material would be a highly complicated task , of comparable difficulty to the original coarse  graining procedure described above .",
    "for further simplicity , we shall not consider @xmath14 but shall instead focus on two limiting cases  : @xmath3 is described in sec .",
    "[ s : global ] , and @xmath10 is assumed in secs .",
    "[ s : local ] and  [ s : monodisperse ] .",
    "the relevant results for the sgr model , which corresponds to the case of @xmath45(constant ) , are also summarised in sec .",
    "[ s : sgr ] .",
    "we have yet to specify @xmath22 , the distribution of energy barriers @xmath20 for elements that have just yielded . in the sgr model , @xmath22 is assumed to have an exponential tail , @xmath46 as @xmath47 , which gives rise to a finite yield stress and diverging viscosity for some values of @xmath0 , but not others  @xcite .",
    "although it is possible to justify the occurrence of an exponential tail in some contexts  @xcite , we prefer instead to treat this choice of @xmath22 , combined with the arrhenius form of @xmath23  ( [ e : gamma ] ) , as a recipe for generating a yield stress within this simple picture of activated yielding .",
    "this may seem _ ad hoc _ , but it should be realised that jamming is in reality a many body effect , involving collective behaviour between a large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "it should therefore come as no surprise that assumptions are required to describe jamming within this single  particle picture .",
    "for much of this paper , we shall assume that @xmath22 has an exponential tail , just as in the sgr model .",
    "in fact , for the numerics the definite form @xmath48 has been used , although it is not expected that the precise shape of @xmath22 for small @xmath20 will alter the long  time or steady state behaviour of the system .",
    "this is because small values of @xmath20 correspond to elements with short expected lifetimes .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that the oscillatory motion described in sec .",
    "[ s : local ] does _ not _ depend on the choice of @xmath22 , and in sec .",
    "[ s : monodisperse ] the simpler form @xmath49 is used , with qualitatively similar results .",
    "there remain three constants in the problem .",
    "these are the elastic constant  @xmath50 , the attempt rate  @xmath43 in  ( [ e : gamma ] ) , and the constant @xmath51 in the definition of @xmath22 given above .",
    "however , these can all be scaled out of the model . for instance",
    ", @xmath50  sets the scale of the stress , and therefore can be removed by rescaling @xmath1 to @xmath52 .",
    "similarly , @xmath43 gives the only intrinsic time scale in the system , and can be scaled out through @xmath8 and  @xmath4 .",
    "finally , @xmath51 sets the scale of the energy barriers , and can be scaled out through  @xmath15 .    in",
    "what follows , we have adopted _ natural _ units in which @xmath53 .",
    "this means that the actual values for @xmath8 , @xmath7 and @xmath1 given below should not be compared to experimental values without first rescaling with the appropriate @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath43 for the material in question .",
    "for example , the typical yield strain according to the @xmath23 given in ( [ e : gamma ] ) is @xmath54 , which is when the effective energy barrier vanishes . in natural units ,",
    "this is of @xmath55 ; however , for soft materials it will typically be of only a few percent , and will be even smaller for hard materials .",
    "thus the scale of the local strains  @xmath2 , and therefore the scale of the global strain  @xmath17 , will generally be significantly smaller in real materials than with natural units .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the standard sgr model is realised when ( using natural units ) the yield rate @xmath23 is chosen to take an arrhenius form with an energy barrier @xmath56 and a constant effective temperature  @xmath0 , and @xmath22 has an exponential tail @xmath57 .",
    "many results for this case are already known  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this section is to briefly describe those results that will be referred to in later sections .",
    "let us assume that the system is driven by a given strain @xmath17 , and that @xmath58 as @xmath59 , where @xmath34 . without loss of generality",
    "we take @xmath60 hereafter . under these conditions ,",
    "the system will reach the steady state solution @xmath38 already given in  ( [ e : st3 ] ) . the asymptotic stress @xmath1 is found by averaging the local strain @xmath2 over @xmath38 , _ i.e. _ @xmath61 , which defines the flow curve @xmath62 . example flow curves for different values of @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : sgr_flow_curves ] . in all cases",
    "the gradient @xmath63 decreases with increasing  @xmath4 , indicating that the apparent viscosity @xmath64 decreases with @xmath4 and that the system is everywhere shear thinning .",
    "it should also be noted that there is a a one  to  one correspondence between @xmath4 and  @xmath1 .",
    "this means that every point on the curve can be reached in one of two ways  : either by applying a known strain @xmath58 , as described above , or by imposing a constant stress @xmath1 .",
    "the uniqueness of the steady state solution ensures that the same @xmath38 will be reached in both cases .",
    "of course , this assumes that the steady state is reached at all , for which it must both exist and be stable .",
    "for the standard sgr model , the steady state solution is stable as long as it exists  @xcite , but this does not hold for all @xmath15 under an imposed stress , as will be discussed in later sections .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath1 as @xmath65 depends upon the choice of  @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "for instance , for @xmath66 the stress scales as @xmath67 and the system is newtonian , whereas there is a power law fluid regime @xmath68 for @xmath69 .",
    "however , the most important regime for our purposes is @xmath70 , for which @xmath1 approaches a finite value .",
    "the yield stress @xmath71 , defined by    @xmath72    smoothly tends to zero as @xmath73 and remains zero for all @xmath74 .",
    "if a system with @xmath70 has a stress @xmath75 applied to it , then it will never reach a steady state with a finite  @xmath4 , simply because @xmath38 for these parameters does not exist .",
    "instead the strain will logarithmically creep according to @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "there may be a crossover to a different behaviour at late times if @xmath1 is close to @xmath71 , but it must always be true that @xmath76 .",
    "the logarithmic creep in @xmath17 under an imposed stress @xmath75 is an important result .",
    "if it is realised in an experimental situation , then when the strain rate @xmath77 drops below the resolution of the apparatus , which it must do at long times , it might be erroneously deduced that the system has stopped flowing altogether , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath78 .",
    "this is in accord with our intuitive notions about jamming  : the sample initially flows when pushed , but later stops flowing , or ` jams . '",
    "one might argue that , technically , a jammed system should have @xmath6 exactly , but it is not possible for any model in this class to sustain a finite stress without a finite  @xmath4 ( unless the sample is allowed to age for an arbitrarily long period of time before being sheared ; see  @xcite ) .",
    "this is because each individual element has a finite relaxation time until it yields and releases its stress , which can only be balanced by an increasing strain .    with this insight",
    ", we now _ define _ a ` jammed ' state for this class of systems to be a configuration which has a finite limiting stress @xmath71 when it is driven by an arbitrarily small strain rate @xmath16 . for the sgr model ,",
    "this corresponds to @xmath70 ; however , for @xmath3 it may also depend on the history of the sample , as will now be discussed .",
    "it is useful to recall the physical picture that underlies an @xmath3 .",
    "as the system becomes sheared , either by an imposed strain @xmath7 or an imposed stress  @xmath1 , it will become distorted , and this may affect its susceptibility to noise .",
    "the precise manner in which this happens will depend on the microscopic composition of the material in question .",
    "for the systems we are interested in , _",
    "i.e. _ those that can shear  thicken or jam , the distorted configuration is _ less _ susceptible to noise that the undistorted one .",
    "one way to incorporate this effect is to regard the system as becoming ` colder ' as its shear stress increases , which corresponds to a decreasing  @xmath5 . thus setting @xmath3",
    "provides a mechanism for allowing the effective temperature @xmath0 to evolve with the global state of the system .    in this section",
    "we shall consider @xmath5 that takes values greater than 1 for some ranges of  @xmath1 , and less than 1 for others . according to the results of the previous section",
    ", this should allow the system to change from a jammed to a flowing state in response to the driving , or more precisely , in response to changes in  @xmath79 .",
    "thus we may be able to observe a shear  induced jamming transition ( something that is not possible in the sgr model , for which the existence of a yield stress depends purely on the choice of the external parameter  @xmath0 ) . for clarity",
    ", we shall restrict our attention to the simplest choice of @xmath5 that has the potential to shear  thicken and jam , namely @xmath80 for small @xmath1 and @xmath81 for large  @xmath1 , with a monotonic ( possibly discontinuous ) behaviour for intermediate  @xmath1 .",
    "although allowing @xmath0 to vary in time according to @xmath82 $ ] can complicate the transient behaviour of the system , as described below , the steady state is easy to analyse .",
    "this is because the very definition of a steady state means that @xmath1 asymptotically approaches a constant value , and thus @xmath0 also becomes constant .",
    "there is therefore a straightforward procedure for generating the @xmath3 flow curves from those of constant  @xmath0  : for any given value of  @xmath1 , one simply finds the sgr flow curve for the corresponding value of @xmath5 and reads off the required value of  @xmath4 .",
    "this amounts to interpolating between the various sgr flow curves .",
    "some examples are given in fig .",
    "[ f : jamming_curves ] for various @xmath5 that change from 1.5 for small @xmath1 to 0.5 for large  @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath5 takes values greater than 1 for small @xmath1 , but smaller than 1 for larger @xmath1 , then it may jam under an applied stress .",
    "however , for this situation to be realised , the applied stress must be simultaneously large enough that @xmath81 , and also small enough that @xmath75 . since the yield stress @xmath71 also depends on  @xmath0 ,",
    "the precise criterion for the upper yield stress to be attainable is that there is a range of @xmath1 for which    @xmath83\\quad .",
    "\\label{e : criterion}\\ ] ]    this corresponds to the region in which the @xmath5 curve falls below the @xmath84 curve when they are both plotted on the same axes , as in fig .",
    "[ f : roots ] .",
    "for example , of the flow curves already presented in fig .",
    "[ f : jamming_curves ] , only the third example obeys the criterion  ( [ e : criterion ] ) for a finite range of @xmath1 .",
    "imposing a stress @xmath1 from within this range will result in a system that is jammed in the sense that the strain logarithmically creeps , @xmath9 and @xmath85 .",
    "two additional complications arise when the system is driven by an imposed strain rate @xmath4 rather than an imposed stress .",
    "firstly , if @xmath4 is increased at a sufficiently slow rate that the system is always arbitrarily close to its steady state , the stress may undergo a discontinuous jump from one branch of the flow curve to another , as marked in figs .",
    "[ f : jamming_curves](b ) and [ f : jamming_curves](c ) .",
    "if @xmath4 is decreased in a similar fashion , then @xmath79 will follow the upper branch until it again jumps discontinuously at a _",
    "different _ value of  @xmath4 .",
    "thus the system exhibits _",
    "hysteresis due to non  monotonic flow curves has also been observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the complementary form of non  monotonicity , which would allow a discontinuous jump in @xmath4 for a small change in  @xmath1 , can not be realised in this class of models .",
    "this is because there is only one value of @xmath5 , and hence one steady state solution , for any given value of  @xmath1 .",
    "the second complication concerns the stability of the jammed state . in fig .",
    "[ f : roots ] , the yield stress @xmath84 and an @xmath5 that obeys ( [ e : criterion ] ) for a range of @xmath1 have been plotted on the same axes .",
    "also plotted is the line of @xmath1 that can be reached for a small but finite  @xmath60 , which converges to @xmath84 as @xmath86 .",
    "these are the @xmath1 that can be realised in practice , since the steady state solution ( [ e : st3 ] ) is not defined for @xmath87 .",
    "for this example there are 3 roots  : a ` flowing ' root with @xmath88 , and two ` jammed ' roots with finite @xmath89 . the arrows in this diagram point in the direction in which the stress will be varying for a given point on the line @xmath5 .",
    "this direction is based on the assumption that , for time scales over which @xmath0 can be treated as a constant , which will certainly include the asymptotic regime , the system will behave like the sgr model and @xmath1 will evolve towards @xmath71 .",
    "it is clear from this that all points tend to flow away from the middle root , which is therefore unstable .",

    "the system can be said to exhibit strong long  term memory , where the use of the word ` strong ' means that the memory of an earlier perturbation of finite duration does not decay to zero with time  @xcite .",

    "in which the stress is rapidly dissipated , then if @xmath4 is sufficiently small , @xmath79 will remain low and the system will crossover to the flowing root , irrespective of  @xmath91 .",
    "however , this effect can be reversed if the initial step shear is replaced by a smoothly varying @xmath19 , such as one that exponentially decays towards its final value of  @xmath4 , which is more like what could be attained in an actual rheometer .",
    "we will not pursue these complications any further here .",
    "in summary , the sgr model generalised to allow the effective temperature @xmath0 to vary with the global stress  @xmath1 can exhibit , for suitable choices of @xmath5  : _ hysteresis _ in @xmath79 for slowly varying @xmath4 , as seen from the flow curves in fig .",

    "the second limiting form for @xmath14 to be considered is one that depends only on the local strain , @xmath10 .",
    "this marks a more drastic departure from the sgr model than the @xmath5 considered in the previous section , since now every element will generally have a different effective temperature  @xmath0 .",
    "the steady state will therefore be different to that of the sgr model , and it will not now be possible to map the flow curves for @xmath11 across from those for constant  @xmath0 .",
    "one could also envisage regions of the parameter space for which the steady state can not even be reached .",
    "indeed , this is precisely what we find  : for some finite region of parameter space , the system reaches an oscillatory regime under an imposed stress , but not under an imposed strain .",
    "this is the central finding of this section .",
    "the physical justification in choosing @xmath10 is similar to that already discussed for @xmath3 , _",
    "i.e. _ it is assumed that the material can become more or less susceptible to noise in its strained state .",
    "the main difference is that this is now assumed to be a local effect , that can be described purely on the level of individual elements .",
    "just as in the previous section , we shall focus our attention on @xmath11 that decrease with  @xmath2 , since it is these that have the potential to exhibit shear thickening .",
    "given @xmath11 , the steady state stress @xmath1 for a given @xmath4 can be found by calculating the mean strain @xmath103 for the steady state solution  ( [ e : st3 ] ) .",
    "some example flow curves are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : local_flow_eg ] .",
    "they are clearly monotonic  : their gradient is everywhere positive , and there is a one  to ",
    "one relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath4 . in these figures ,",
    "the @xmath11 were chosen to vary in a stepwise manner , taking a value @xmath104 for @xmath105 and a lower value @xmath70 for @xmath106 .",
    "this is typical of the @xmath11 employed in this section .",
    "however , the monotonicity result is entirely general and applies for any @xmath10 , as demonstrated in appendix  [ s : monotonicity ] .",
    "the physical reason for the monotonicity of the flow curves is that the elements are uncoupled when @xmath10 and the system is driven by an imposed strain  @xmath17 .",
    "that is , the expected strain reached before a given element yields does not depend on the state of any other elements .",
    "this is _ not _ true for the general case @xmath14 , when the value of @xmath0 for an element depends on the global stress @xmath1 , and thus on the state of the rest of the system .",
    "as long as independence holds , the average strain reached before each individual element yields , and hence the global stress  @xmath1 , can only increase with increasing  @xmath4 .",
    "thus the flow curves must be monotonic .",
    "the monotonicity of the flow curves is an important finding . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "rheological instabilities often arise when the system has been driven to a point on its flow curve which has a negative gradient .",
    "fluctuations can then cause spatial inhomogeneities to arise , such as shear bands with either the same stress and different strain rates , or equal strain rates but differing stresses  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , temporal oscillations may be observed  @xcite .",
    "since the flow curves for @xmath10 have no regions of negative slope , one would not expect any instabilities to appear in this model .",
    "nonetheless temporal oscillations in @xmath4 do occur for a finite range of imposed  @xmath1 , as we now describe .",
    "the monotonicity result described above was attributed to the independence of the elements , which is only true for a strain controlled system .",
    "by contrast , the elements become coupled under an imposed @xmath1 since , for example , a single element yielding causes the mean strain to decrease slightly , which must be immediately countered by an increase in @xmath4 , _ which affects every element in the system_. thus collective behaviour can now occur .",
    "in fact , this collective behaviour can not alter any system that has already reached steady flow , which we know is identical for strain and stress controlled systems .",
    "thus as long as the stress controlled system reaches steady flow , it will fall onto the same monotonic flow curve as before .",
    "however , the couplings between the elements can drastically alter the transient behaviour , to such an extent that steady flow may never be reached .",
    "an example of collective behaviour is given in fig .",
    "[ f : local_osc_eg ] , which shows @xmath19 for a system driven by an imposed stress @xmath107 .",
    "as before , this plot was generated by numerically integrating the master equation ( [ e : master ] ) from an initially unstrained state , using the procedure described in appendix  [ s : numerics ] .",
    "for this example , the system undergoes a short transient before entering into an oscillatory regime , in which @xmath19 varies with a single period of oscillation .",
    "there is no suggestion of a decay in the amplitude of the oscillation in @xmath19 over the largest simulation times attainable , even when plotted against @xmath108 ( not shown ) , suggesting that this is the true asymptotic behaviour . for different choices of @xmath11",
    "it is not possible to identify a single period of oscillation , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ f : local_trans_eg ] .",
    "it is not yet clear if this behaviour represents a distinct regime with more than one period of oscillation , possibly even a precursor to chaotic behaviour , or if it is merely a long  lived transient that eventually crosses over to either steady flow or a single  period oscillation at later times .",
    "the extensive simulation times means that we have so far been unable to map out the class of @xmath11 that give rise to an oscillatory or otherwise non  steady state .",
    "nonetheless we can make the following observation .",
    "for all of the oscillatory cases that we have observed thus far , @xmath11 changes from a value in the range @xmath69 for small  @xmath2 , to a value @xmath70 for larger  @xmath2 .",
    "other choices of @xmath11 may produce an oscillatory transient , but its amplitude always seems to decay to zero in time .",
    "it is not clear to us why only this class of @xmath11 can produce a stable oscillatory regime , but it is tempting to note that the requirement that @xmath69 for small @xmath2 is also the range of @xmath0 for which the sgr model does not have a linear regime under an imposed  @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "that is , a significant proportion of elements will eventually gain a finite strain , no matter how small @xmath1 is , and thus the variation in @xmath11 will eventually be ` felt . ' once a suitable @xmath11 has been found , it is possible to move in and out of the non  steady regime by varying the applied stress  @xmath1 .",
    "generally , we find that a high @xmath1 gives rise to steady flow , and low @xmath1 produces oscillations ; however , the excessive simulation times needed for small @xmath1 means that we have not been able to rule out another crossover to steady flow as @xmath109 . within the oscillatory regime ,",
    "the mean strain rate averaged over a period of oscillation is generally much lower than that predicted by the flow curve .",
    "for the examples already given , the mean strain rate deviates from the flow curve by a factor of 2 for the oscillations shown in fig .",
    "[ f : local_osc_eg ] , and by two orders of magnitude for the ( possibly transient ) oscillations of fig .",
    "[ f : local_trans_eg ] .",
    "again , we have been unable to fully characterise this behaviour with the available simulation resources .",
    "to an extent , these problems will be alleviated by considering a simplified model considered in sec .",
    "[ s : monodisperse ] . before turning to consider this",
    ", we provide a qualitative description of the oscillatory behaviour in terms of the local strains  @xmath2 .",
    "the mechanism behind the oscillatory behaviour can be qualitatively understood by inspecting the evolution of the @xmath25 distribution during a single period of oscillation . as an example",
    ", a suitable sequence of snapshots is given in fig .",
    "[ f : snapshots_poly ] . to aid in the interpretation of these figures , it is useful to recall some properties of the master equation  ( [ e : master ] ) .",
    "firstly , the convective term @xmath110 means that any maxima or minima in @xmath25 will move in the direction of increasing @xmath2 at a rate  @xmath19 .",
    "these extrema will eventually disappear when large values of @xmath2 are reached , and the yield rate @xmath23 becomes very high .",
    "also , there is a flux of newly  yielded elements at @xmath27 , which have barriers @xmath20 weighted according to @xmath22 .    since the oscillatory behaviour is by definition cyclical , it is somewhat arbitrary where one chooses to start the sequence of snapshots . in fig .",
    "[ f : snapshots_poly ] we have chosen times corresponding to before , during and just after the point when @xmath4 reaches its maximum value . in the first snapshot , @xmath25 is concentrated into two regions  : a sharp peak at @xmath111 , and a broader peak with @xmath2 in the range @xmath112 .",
    "the first peak is ` hot ' in the sense that it has the higher value of  @xmath11 , but since it has a low strain , it does not significantly contribute to the total stress  @xmath1 .",
    "the second peak , although highly strained , lies in a region in which @xmath11 is small , and therefore has a low rate of yielding .",
    "as long as the yield rate is low , so too is the rate of stress loss from elements that belong to this peak .",
    "therefore the strain rate @xmath4 will also be low , and indeed this first example corresponds to a system in which @xmath4 is close to its minimum value .",
    "this state of affairs is not stable , however .",
    "although the yield rate of the highly strained elements is low , it is nonetheless non  zero , and therefore so is  @xmath4 .",
    "consequently the whole system is being convected at a finite rate , so the elements in the high@xmath2 region are becoming more strained .",
    "_ decreases _ their effective energy barrier @xmath113 , which _ increases _ their yield rate .",
    "but an increased yield rate means an increased  @xmath4 , which in turn increases the rate at which the elements are becoming more strained , which increases their yield rate yet more , and so on .",
    "this description is that of a _ positive feedback loop _ , which causes @xmath4 to increase at ever faster rates until all of the heavily strained elements have been depleted . the second snapshot in fig .",
    "[ f : snapshots_poly ] show the state of the system shortly before this has happened .    at the same time that the highly ",
    "strained elements are being depleted , @xmath4 is close to its maximum value and consequently @xmath25 in the small @xmath2 region becomes somewhat flat , certainly much flatter than under a small  @xmath4 .",
    "this can clearly be seen in the second and third snapshots of fig .",
    "[ f : snapshots_poly ] .",
    "when @xmath4 again falls to lower values , this flat part of the distribution will start to decay as the elements within it yield .",
    "however , the yield rate depends on  @xmath11 , and since @xmath11 changes to a lower value at @xmath114 , @xmath25 will decay much more rapidly for @xmath2 just smaller than @xmath115 than for @xmath2 just greater than @xmath115 .",
    "thus a dip will occur around the point @xmath116 , which can clearly be seen in the final snapshot .",
    "as time increases , this dip will become more pronounced until the system can again be separated into a population of highly ",
    "strained elements and a second population with @xmath111 .",
    "this is where we began , and thus the cycle is complete .",
    "it is possible to more completely describe the oscillatory regime for a simplified version of the model where every element has the same energy barrier @xmath117 .",
    "this formally corresponds to a ` monodisperse ' prior distribution @xmath49 , as opposed to the exponential @xmath118 which has been employed in all of the earlier sections .",
    "the reduction in the number of degrees of freedom that this entails significantly decreases the simulation times , and therefore allows for a more thorough numerical investigation of the model .",
    "it is also possible to derive an analytical criterion for the stability of the steady state , as described below .",
    "furthermore , the very fact that a monodisperse system also has an oscillatory regime clearly demonstrates that this phenomenon is robust .",
    "in particular , it does not require the usual sgr assumption of an exponential tail to @xmath22 .",
    "therefore the possible existence of a yield stress , which was so central to the history ",
    "dependent jamming scenario at controlled @xmath4 described in sec .",
    "[ s : global ] , is not necessary .",
    "this robustness means that the mechanism behind the oscillations at controlled @xmath1 may be realisable in a much broader range of models than the restricted set considered here and , possibly , may also occur in real materials .",
    "the emergence of oscillations in this monodisperse model has been separately discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "here we supply extra details , such as the stability analysis of the steady flow state . for the sake of completeness",
    ", the overall behaviour of the model will also be briefly described , although we refer the reader to  @xcite for a fuller discussion of many of the points raised below .",
    "perhaps the most immediate consequence of only allowing a single barrier @xmath117 is that the system can never have a finite yield stress .",
    "indeed , in the linear regime @xmath76 , the steady state stress is just @xmath119 , which vanishes with @xmath4 .",
    "there are no qualitative differences for @xmath70 , @xmath69 _ etc .",
    "_ , as in the sgr model .",
    "the complete lack of a yield stress means that a monodisperse system with @xmath3 will _ not _ exhibit a jamming transition , in contrast to the situation for a @xmath22 with an exponential tail described sec .",
    "[ s : global ] .",

    "the ratio of the maximum value of @xmath19 to its minimum has been shown to exceed two orders of magnitude , and we see no reason to deny that greater separations may be attained for different parameter values .    it is tempting to refer to this behaviour of @xmath19 as ` stick  slip ' behaviour , in which the system is ` stuck ' until the short duration of time in which @xmath4 rapidly accelerates to its maximum value , corresponding to a ` slip ' event .",
    "this kind of response is also observed in earthquakes  @xcite , ultra ",
    "thin liquid films  @xcite and granular media  @xcite , for example .",
    "however , we have instead chosen to refer to the variation in @xmath19 as merely ` oscillatory , ' since the underlying physics seems to be somewhat different to the examples of stick  slip behaviour mentioned above . in particular , the term stick  slip is usually employed to refer to a surface friction phenomenon , whereas the models studied in this paper have no surface , or indeed any form of spatial definition .",
    "they are only intended to describe the bulk behaviour of a material .",
    "furthermore , we only find oscillations in @xmath19 under an imposed  @xmath1 , and never _ vice versa _ , whereas stick  slip seems to more usually ( although not exclusively ) refer to variations in the ( normal ) stress under a constant driving velocity . thus to avoid possible confusion , we choose not to refer to the behaviour observed in the models as stick ",
    "we have introduced a range of schematic models that are capable of exhibiting a form of jamming under an imposed stress  @xmath1 .",
    "the models are based on the sgr model of sollich _ et al .",
    "_ , but differ in that the effective temperature @xmath0 is no longer constant , and can instead vary with the state of the system through either the global stress @xmath1 or the local strain  @xmath2 .",
    "we have considered choices of @xmath0 that decrease for increasing @xmath1 or  @xmath2 , which is relevant to the study of shear thickening materials .",
    "these models have no spatial definition , and thus by construction can not exhibit any form of spatial heterogeneity .    for @xmath3",
    ", the flow curves can be extracted from the known curves for constant  @xmath0 .",
    "many choices of @xmath5 produce flow curves with non  monotonic regions , which exhibit hysteresis in @xmath79 under ramping the strain rate @xmath19 first upwards and then downwards .",
    "furthermore , a subset of these @xmath5 also give rise to a _ jammed _ state for a range of applied stresses , in that the strain @xmath17 creeps logarithmically , @xmath165 .",
    "the criterion for this to arise is that the curve of @xmath5 drops below the sgr yield stress curve @xmath84 when they are plotted on the same axes . for an imposed strain rate that decays to zero at late times ,",
    "a jammed configuration was defined as one with a finite asymptotic stress , @xmath166 as @xmath167 and @xmath18 .",
    "it was found that whether or not a jammed configuration was reached depends on the entire strain history of the system , a situation that was referred to as _ history dependent jamming_.    for @xmath10 , the flow curves are always monotonic , and steady flow is always reached under a constant imposed strain rate @xmath58 . however , for a range of imposed stresses and some choices of @xmath11 , steady flow is not realised . numerical integration of the master equation demonstrated that @xmath19 oscillated around a well  defined mean with a single period of oscillation .",
    "the possibility of more complex non  steady behaviour in some regions of parameter space could not be ruled out .",
    "a similar oscillatory behaviour occurs with a simpler model in which every element has the same energy barrier  @xcite , which suggests that this phenomenon is robust .",
    "finally , we discussed the relationship between this oscillatory behaviour and that observed in experiments , and considered analogous phenomena from fields outside of rheology .",
    "the authors would like to thank suzanne fielding for stimulating discussions concerning this work .",

    "direct numerical integration of the master equation ( [ e : master ] ) has proven to be unstable with respect to discretisation errors . instead , the results in this paper were generated from the transformed equation    @xmath168    where @xmath169 .",
    "this removes the convective term and dramatically improves numerical stability .",
    "the discrete probability distribution @xmath170 was defined on a rectangular mesh of points @xmath171 and evolved according to ( [ e : dl_master ] ) by using a straightforward euler method .",
    "a further refinement was to average both the evolution equation ( [ e : dl_master ] ) and the initial conditions over the ranges @xmath172 and ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "this significantly reduces the number of mesh points required for the simulations to properly converge , without unduly increasing the algorithmic complexity .",
    "the delta function was treated as a triangle of base width @xmath174 and height @xmath175 , but any sufficiently narrow function gave the same results .",
    "two classes of initial conditions were employed , but the long  time behaviour of the system was found to be identical in both cases . only the short term behaviour varied , and then only in a non  essential manner . for the sake of completeness , the initial conditions were  : ( i )  a ` quench ' @xmath176 , which corresponds to the unstrained equilibrium at @xmath177 , or ( ii )  @xmath178 with @xmath179^{-1}$ ] , which corresponds to an unstrained system that has been allowed to reached equilibrium .",
    "note that this second initial state is only defined for @xmath180  @xcite .",
    "the strain @xmath17 is only known _ a priori _ for a strain  controlled system .",
    "when it is rather a known stress @xmath79 that is applied , @xmath17 must be chosen at every time step so that the actual stress does not differ from @xmath79 by more than a tolerance parameter  @xmath181 . to ensure that this condition was satisfied in our simulations , a series of trial strain rates @xmath182 were generated and tested on a replica mesh @xmath183 .",
    "the @xmath184 were not updated until a suitable @xmath4 had been found .",
    "the trial values @xmath185 were generated as follows . for a continuous time variable , @xmath186",
    "exactly , as seen by multiplying the master equation ( [ e : master ] ) by @xmath2 and integrating over all @xmath20 and  @xmath2 .",
    "this is therefore the sensible choice for @xmath187 .",
    "however , integrating over a finite time step @xmath188 inevitably introduces errors of @xmath189 , and so the integrated stress will differ from the required value by some small amount @xmath190 .",
    "reintegrating with @xmath191 will therefore reduce the error to a smaller amount @xmath192 .",
    "this procedure can be repeated to generate a series of successively better estimates @xmath193 , @xmath194 _ etc . _ for our choice of @xmath195 , we have found that typically 35 such trials are needed at every time step .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to show that the flow curves are monotonic for any yield rate @xmath196 that depends only on the local strain  @xmath2 .",
    "this includes the thermally activated @xmath196 with @xmath10 , possibly constant , but not when @xmath0 also depends on the stress  @xmath1 .",
    "it also applies for an arbitrary prior barrier distribution @xmath22 .        where we have introduced the short  hand notation @xmath199 .",
    "the stress is @xmath200 , where the angled brackets ` @xmath201 ' denote the average over @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath202 depends on  @xmath1 , then a @xmath1 must be chosen that is consistent with  ( [ e : st3 ] ) . in general",
    "there can be more than one suitable  @xmath1 .",
    "the final line in this equation is valid as @xmath210 is a constant , so @xmath211 .",
    "since @xmath212 is an increasing function of  @xmath2 , the quantity in the angled brackets in ( [ e : mono_ans ] ) is positive both for @xmath213 and for @xmath214 , and vanishes smoothly at @xmath215 .",
    "thus the left hand side must be positive , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath1 always increases with @xmath4 , as claimed .",
    "the same conclusion does not hold when @xmath216 . since @xmath1 depends on @xmath4 , differentiating the steady state solution now gives rise to an extra term on the right hand side of ( [ e : mono_local ] ) ,          thus it is now possible for the gradient to diverge if @xmath220 is sufficiently negative , _",
    "i.e. _ if @xmath221 decreases sufficiently rapidly with @xmath1 .",
    "for the particular case of @xmath222 , the gradient of the flow curve diverges at any point such that"
