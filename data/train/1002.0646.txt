    "paraxial beams with non - zero orbital angular momentum , which are exact eigenmodes of the paraxial wave equation @xcite , have been of considerable interest @xcite .",
    "in addition to spin angular momentum ( polarization ) , paraxial beams carry an intrinsic orbital angular momentum that depends on their spatial structure .",
    "while the transfer of spin angular momentum to matter has long been reported for optically anisotropic media @xcite , the transfer of orbital angular momentum has newly triggered a wide range of applications .",
    "a notable example is particle trapping @xcite , whereby particles are set into rotation by coupling with the beam s orbital angular momentum and are thus trapped .",
    "such a coupling of the orbital angular momentum with matter is possible in optically inhomogeneous isotropic media @xcite .",
    "thus , a simultaneous independent coupling of both spin and orbital angular momentum with matter is to be expected in a medium which is both optically inhomogeneous and anisotropic @xcite .    in the past decades",
    ", the geometric berry phase @xcite acquired by an optical beam ( as the pancharatnam phase @xcite or a spin redirection phase @xcite ) has attracted extensive attention .",
    "in particular , bliokh et .",
    "@xcite developed a modified geometrical optics approximation for optically weakly inhomogeneous isotropic media , which contained the rytov - vladimirskii rotation law @xcite and the optical magnus effect @xcite ( also called the optical hall effect ) as manifestations of berry effects .",
    "such geometric berry effects have been also derived via the semiclassical wave packet approximation @xcite , which was originally developed for the study of electronic spin transport in solids @xcite .    by studying the propagation of paraxial beams in optically weakly inhomogeneous isotropic media ,",
    "bliokh @xcite demonstrated that the optical hall effect becomes more pronounced because of the contribution of the orbital angular momentum hall effect due to the orbit - orbit interaction . here",
    ", we generalize his results for screw dislocated ( amorphous ) optical media .",
    "mechanical deformation can result in dislocations that change the optical properties of a medium due to the elasto - optic effect .",
    "such dislocations can be induced by the focused beam itself ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the study of beam transport provides an indirect way to determine the dislocations as well as the elasto - optical properties of the medium . in the present work ,",
    "we study paraxial beam propagation parallel to the screw axis of a dislocated amorphous medium that is optically weakly inhomogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the paraxial beam contains an optical dislocation , namely the optical vortex along its axis , which is a topological object on the wavefront the beam @xcite . regarding the medium as a continuum",
    ", we use the differential geometric theory of defects which is isomorphic to three dimensional gravity @xcite . in this geometric approach",
    ", the effect of defects on the three dimensional geometry of the medium is incorporated into a metric .",
    "the effect of the screw dislocation on the beam s orbital angular momentum is , thus , shown to change the optical vortex strength , rendering vortex annihilation ( for left - handed helical modes ) or generation of non - integral vortices @xcite possible .",
    "this is useful in generating fast switchable helical modes for optical information encoding @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dislocation is shown to induce a weak _ biaxial _ anisotropy in the medium due to the elasto - optic effect .",
    "this anisotropy , which is felt more strongly by beams that propagate close to the dislocation line , changes the beam s spin angular momentum as well as causing precession of the polarization .",
    "finally , we derive the equations of motion of the beam and demonstrate how beams with different values of spin and/or angular momentum split in the dislocated medium ( the optical hall effect ) . because the beam s singular vortex core can be observed with great accuracy , measurement of the splittings is very reliable .",
    "measuring beam splittings for opposite values of the polarization and orbital angular momentum provides an indirect method for determining the burgers vector as well as the elasto - optic coefficients of the medium .",
    "determination of the former is demonstrated in a simple example .",
    "dislocation is a defect caused by the action of internal stress , which changes the physical properties of the medium , in particular , its optical properties .",
    "the displacement vector field , @xmath0 , associated with a screw dislocation line oriented along the @xmath1-axis of the cylindrical coordinates @xmath2 is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the magnitude of burgers vector divided by @xmath5 .",
    "the corresponding strain tensor field @xmath6 is , thus , given by @xmath7 , other components being zero .",
    "regarding the medium as a continuum , we can use the differential geometric theory of defects which is isomorphic to three dimensional gravity @xcite . in this geometric approach",
    ", the effect of defects on the three dimensional geometry of the medium is incorporated into a metric . in particular , a screw dislocation , which corresponds to a singular torsion along the defect line , is described by the following metric @xcite @xmath8 this metric carries torsion but no curvature and describes a screw dislocated medium .",
    "we consider a monochromatic paraxial beam with definite values of the spin and orbital angular momentum , propagating in a weakly inhomogeneous isotropic medium where the refractive index @xmath9 varies adiabatically with position ( @xmath10 ) . with the screw axis",
    "@xmath1 as the paraxial direction , the beam s electric field can be represented as in a homogeneous medium according to @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the wave number , the adiabatic variation of which has been neglected ( @xmath13 being the wave number in vacuum ) , @xmath14 with @xmath15 ( @xmath16 being the cylindrical unit vectors ) are the orthonormal polarization vectors corresponding , respectively , to right / left circular polarization and @xmath17 @xmath18 ; with @xmath19 and @xmath20 ; being the radial solution of the helmholtz equation ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 represent the helicity and the @xmath1-component of the orbital angular momentum of the photon , respectively ( @xmath23 ) ) . in the presence of screw dislocation , the laplacian operator @xmath24 appearing in the helmholtz equation",
    "is to be replaced by @xmath25 which is the laplacian associated with the metric ( [ metric ] ) of the dislocated medium .",
    "the solution ( [ soln ] ) , therefore , acquires an additional phase factor due to the coupling of torsion with angular momentum , according to @xmath26 furthermore , the relative permittivity tensor @xmath27 acquires an anisotropic part @xmath28 due to the strain field of the dislocation , where ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath29 @xmath30 being the elasto - optic coefficients of the medium . for amorphous media , where only two independent elasto - optic coefficients ( customarily denoted by @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) exist ,",
    "the screw dislocation yields @xmath33 other components being zero .",
    "the principle refractive indices are , therefore , @xmath34 to first order in the perturbation , which is generally sufficiently small .",
    "hence , the elasto - optic perturbation induces a weak _ biaxial _ anisotropy in the medium , which is felt more strongly by beams that propagate close to the dislocation line ( small @xmath35 ) .",
    "propagation of the beam through the dislocated medium , thus , introduces the phases @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the linear polarization states represented by @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "hence , in ( [ soln ] ) , the polarization vector should be rewritten as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the induced birefringence .",
    "equivalently , @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "equations ( [ soln ] ) to ( [ e ] ) form our expression for the field of a paraxial beam propagating in an optically weakly inhomogeneous and isotropic amorphous medium with screw dislocation . with the beam scalar product defined by @xcite @xmath45",
    "these beams form a complete orthonormal set , in terms of which an arbitrary field distribution can be constructed .",
    "the paraxial beam contains an optical dislocation , namely the optical vortex of strength @xmath22 along its axis , which is a topological object on the wavefront the beam @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-component of the beam s orbital angular momentum ( per photon ) is given by the expectation value @xmath46 the fact that its value has changed from @xmath22 to @xmath47 owes itself to the torque exerted by the strain field of the dislocation .",
    "the effect of the screw dislocation on the orbital angular momentum , therefore , is to change the optical vortex strength , rendering vortex annihilation ( for negative values of @xmath22 , i.e. , left handed helical modes ) or generation of non - integral vortices @xcite possible .",
    "this is useful in generating fast switchable helical modes for optical information encoding @xcite .",
    "moreover , the @xmath1-component of the beam s spin angular momentum is @xcite @xmath48 as expected @xcite , the spin component varies along the paraxial direction due to the induced elasto - optic birefringence .",
    "therefore , a screw dislocated medium exerts torques that change both the spin and orbital parts of the beam s angular momentum .",
    "the spin change , being attributed to the elasto - optic effect , is more pronounced for beams that propagate close to the dislocation line .",
    "note that , the @xmath1-component of the beam s total angular momentum , @xmath49 reduces to the constant value @xmath50 in the absence of the screw dislocation ( @xmath51 ) , as it should .",
    "the adiabatic variation of the wave number @xmath52 , caused by the weak inhomogeneity , has negligible dynamical effect and was , therefore , ignored .",
    "however , the adiabatic variation of the beam direction ( given by its wave vector @xmath53 ) plays a geometric role with nontrivial consequences for the beam dynamics . to incorporate this variation",
    ", we treat the coordinate frame used in the previous section as a local frame following the beam direction . as usual",
    ", the variation gives rise to a parallel transport law in the momentum space , defined by the berry connection ( gauge potential ) @xmath54 using ( [ soln ] ) to ( [ e ] ) , we obtain @xmath55\\frac{\\cot\\theta}{k } \\textbf{e}_\\varphi\\ ] ] or , in matrix notation , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the pauli matrix vector and @xmath58 equation ( [ m ] ) generalizes the result of @xcite for dislocated ( amorphous ) media .",
    "the first two terms are associated with the parallel transport of the beam s transverse structure @xcite , while the last describes the parallel transport of the polarization vector along the beam .",
    "note , in particular , the appearance of @xmath59 which shows the non - abelian nature of the polarization transport , to be anticipated in view of the anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the berry curvature ( gauge field strength ) associated with this connection is ( @xmath60 ) @xmath61 where @xmath62 .    in the course of propagation , the paraxial beam evolves according to @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the geometric berry phase . here",
    "@xmath65 is the beam trajectory in momentum space , @xmath66 is the berry phase accumulated for @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the absence of dislocation and @xmath69 .",
    "the first term yields a rotation ( through angle -@xmath70 ) of the beam s transverse structure about the direction of propagation , while the second yields a polarization precession about the direction of @xmath71 .",
    "such a spin precession is characteristic of anisotropic media @xcite .",
    "( in the absence of dislocation , the second term in ( [ ph ] ) simply yields the phase factor @xmath72 that leads to the well known rytov rotation . )    in view of the polarization evolution , the berry curvature for a given beam is , therefore , @xmath73 where @xmath74 using the baker - hausdorff formula , @xmath75+\\frac{(-i)^2}{2!}[g,[g , a]]+\\frac{(-i)^3}{3!}[g,[g,[g , a]]]+\\ldots\\ ] ] and @xmath76=2i\\epsilon_{ijk}\\sigma_k$ ] , after some calculations we find @xmath77 where @xmath78 . hence @xmath79 where @xmath80 therefore , @xmath81 with @xmath82 which reduces to the result of @xcite in the absence of dislocation , namely , the field of a magnetic monopole of charge @xmath83 situated at the origin of the momentum space .",
    "the equations of motion of the beam in the presence of momentum space berry curvature have been derived repeatedly for various particle beams ( photons @xcite , phonons @xcite and electrons @xcite ) .",
    "we have @xmath84 where dot denotes derivative with respect to the beam length .",
    "these differ from the standard ray equations of the geometrical optics by the term involving the berry curvature , which yields the beam displacement @xmath85 the displacement , which results in the splitting of beams with different polarizations and/or orbital angular momentums , is orthogonal to the beam direction and produces a current across the direction of propagation .",
    "this is the optical hall effect in the dislocated medium and generalizes the result of @xcite . because the beam s singular vortex core can be observed with great accuracy , measurement of the displacements is very reliable .",
    "measuring @xmath86 for opposite values of @xmath22 and @xmath21 provides an indirect method for determining the burgers vector as well as the elasto - optic coefficients ( or rather their difference @xmath87 ) of the medium .",
    "we conclude by describing a simple situation that demonstrates the application of the result ( [ def ] ) in determining the magnitude of the burgers vector .",
    "silicon , being transparent in the near infrared , has attracted extensive attention in optoelectronic devices .",
    "waveguides in silicon can serve as optical interconnects in silicon integrated circuits , or distribute optical clock signals in a microprocessor .",
    "fabrication of such waveguides requires a core with a higher refractive index than that of crystalline silicon .",
    "amorphous silicon , with a higher refractive index in the near infrared , thus provides an interesting candidate for the core material @xcite .",
    "let us , therefore , consider an amorphous silicon cylindrical waveguide with screw dislocation along its axis @xmath1 .",
    "for a beam propagating inside the waveguide along its circular cross section , the trajectory @xmath65 in ( [ def ] ) is a circle of radius @xmath88 in the @xmath89-plane ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath91 and @xmath92 so that ( [ def ] ) yields , for every one revolution of the beam , @xmath93 \\textbf{e}_z\\ ] ] where , of course , @xmath94 is the unit vector in the @xmath1-direction and @xmath95 is the magnitude of the burgers vector .",
    "therefore , for two beams of opposite polarization and orbital angular momentum , we have a displacement ( per unit revolution ) in the negative z - direction given by @xmath96 while @xmath97 , @xmath98 can take any value ( including zero ) by suitably tuning @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "thus one can have the oppositely polarized beams emerging from the same end of the waveguide , with one lagging behind the other , or from opposite ends ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . keeping the emerging direction of the right - handed beam as the reference direction",
    ", the emerging direction of the left handed beam changes at the threshold value @xmath101 . with @xmath99 in the near infrared , this provides an experimental method of determining burgers vector magnitudes of the order of micrometers .",
