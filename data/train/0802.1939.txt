    "solitons , as solutions of non - linear wave equations have , by now , been studied extensively for many years @xcite .",
    "however , they are still producing new and unexpected phenomena . such is , for instance , their behaviour when one sends a soliton towards a potential obstruction as was studied in @xcite , @xcite . the results presented in these papers were obtained for solitons in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions and for the sine - gordon model in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions .    in a recent study",
    "@xcite we looked at a similar scattering of solitons in two ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional @xmath5 models . in these models",
    "we have inserted potential obstructions in two different ways , in each case modifying the lagrangian of the model in a region far away from the soliton . in the first model",
    "this modification was introduced via the coupling of the potential ( which was made to be position dependent ) , while in the second model this was achieved via the modification of the minkowski space - time metric @xcite .    in each model , like in @xcite and @xcite , the topological solitons were found to scatter on the barrier in a very elastic way : they can either overcome the barrier and get transmitted or get reflected from the barrier with almost no loss of energy .",
    "however , the scattering from a hole was found to be inelastic and , at times , produced an almost non - classical behaviour as solitons with energies below a critical value for the transmission could either be trapped in the hole or get reflected ! this reflection resembles a little the quantum reflection and so ,",
    "perhaps , some classical phenomena based on solitons could be confused with their quantum behaviour .    in view of this",
    "we have decided to look at other models ; to see whether the observed phenomena are ` universal ' . a good class of such models is provided by the models of bazeia et al @xcite .",
    "not only they depend on a parameter ( which takes integer values ) ; they also reduce to the well known sine - gordon model for a specific value of this parameter . hence in this paper",
    "we look at the scattering of solitons in these models on both potential holes and potential barriers . like in the original work on the sine - gordon model @xcite the obstructions are introduced via the modification of the coupling constant in the models _",
    "i.e. _ by making it space dependent .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the models of bazeia et al @xcite and discuss some of their properties .",
    "we present the relevant lagrangians ( for both classes of generalizations of the sine - gordon model ) and discuss their soliton ( kink - like ) solutions .",
    "the following two sections discuss our results on the scattering of these solitons ( from each class ) on both types of obstructions .",
    "we finish the paper with a short section presenting our conclusions .",
    "we consider , in full generality , a single real scalar field in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions    @xmath6    where the potential @xmath7 is taken in the form    @xmath8 ,    in which @xmath9 .    here",
    "@xmath10 is an extra potential parameter which has been inserted into the potential @xmath7 to take into account the effects of obstructions , holes and barriers , and so is nonzero only in a certain region of space .    in our case",
    ", we put the obstruction around the origin ( _ i.e. _ @xmath11 ) so we take    @xmath12    the equation of motion is , of course , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the derivative of @xmath15 with respect to the argument .",
    "the models of bazeia et al @xcite correspond to choosing ( ` type 1 ' models ) @xmath16 of the form : @xmath17 when @xmath1 this model reduces to the sine - gordon one .",
    "the second class ( ` type ii models ' ) correspond to taking @xmath16 in the form @xmath18    in this case the sine - gordon model corresponds to @xmath2 .",
    "both classes of models are topological as in each case we can write for the static fields : @xmath19    the last term is a total divergence and so we see that the equation for the static solitons ( bogomolnyi equation ) becomes @xmath20    the solutions of ( [ bogo ] ) are easy to find in the case when we have no obstruction ( _ i.e. _ when @xmath21 ) .",
    "they are given by ( for the first class of models ) : @xmath22^\\frac{1}{\\,n } ,   \\label{onee}\\ ] ] where , due to the lorentz invariance of the full lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) , we have inserted the time dependence by performing the relativistic boost . in ( [ onee ] )",
    "@xmath23 is the usual relativistic factor , _ ie _ @xmath24 .",
    "the expression ( [ onee ] ) is , in fact , a solution of ( [ bogo ] ) when @xmath21 .",
    "it is also an approximate solution of ( [ bogo ] ) when @xmath25 for @xmath26 far away from the region in which @xmath27 .    the soliton solutions ( [ onee ] ) satisfy the kink boundary conditions    @xmath28 .",
    "for the second class of models the soliton solutions ( again with the same comments about the @xmath29 dependence of @xmath30 ) are given by :    @xmath31^\\frac{1}{\\,n},\\ ] ]    and they satisfy the following boundary conditions :    @xmath32 .    in figures 1 and 2 we present plots of the static soliton field configurations for the type i and type ii models , respectively , for the first 6 models in each class , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath33 .    in the next section",
    "we look at the scattering properties of these solitonic solutions in the first class of models .",
    "= 1, ... ,6.,width=302 ]    = 1, ... ,6.,width=302 ]",
    "before we consider the scattering properties of the solitonic solutions let us observe that the mass ( rest energy ) of a static soliton is given by @xmath34\\,dx.\\ ] ] the energy of a soliton moving with velocity @xmath35 is then given by    @xmath36    to calculate @xmath37 we note that it can be rewritten as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is    @xmath40 .    to perform the calculation of ( [ mass ] ) it is convenient to change variables from @xmath29 to @xmath41 .",
    "then ( [ mass ] ) becomes proportional to @xmath42 _ i.e. _ @xmath43    this integral defining @xmath42 can be performed explicitly for each value of @xmath0 .",
    "we find that @xmath44 and all others satisfy the recurrence relation @xmath45\\frac{1}{n+2}.\\ ] ]    in figure 3 we plot the rest mass energies for @xmath33 .",
    "the figure shows that solitons becomes less massive as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the figure also shows that the @xmath2 the soliton is very massive .",
    ", width=302 ]    next we considered the scattering properties of these solitons . to do this",
    "we put our obstructions close to @xmath11 ( in fact between -5 and 5 ) and initially placed solitons far away from @xmath11 , namely around @xmath46 sending them with some velocity @xmath35 towards the obstruction . in our numerical work",
    "we used the square well potential barriers and holes of width 10 .",
    "the width was chosen carefully so that the solitons can fit into the potential hole and have enough space to move inside the hole or on the top of the barrier .",
    "the simulations were performed using the 4th order runge - kutta method of simulating the time evolution .",
    "we used 1201 points with the lattice spacing of @xmath47 .",
    "hence , the lattice extended from -60 to 60 in the @xmath29-direction .",
    "the time step was chosen to be @xmath48 . in our work",
    "we used the absorbing boundary conditions .",
    "our simulations have shown that , like in the previous work on the sine - gordon @xcite and @xmath49 @xcite models , for any @xmath0 , there is a critical velocity above which the solitons are transmitted by the hole and below which they are either trapped or reflected .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite which present earlier work on this subject with an interesting explanation of the reflection property of the hole in terms of the interference of the soliton field with the radiation waves generated by the scattering .",
    "hence we believe that the observed phenomenon is a generic behaviour of topological solitons as they encounter a potential hole .",
    "the value of the critical velocity depends on the model in question .",
    "the scattering is inelastic with the soliton emitting radiation both in the hole and / if when it has left the hole .",
    "the amount of the emitted radiation is expected to be related to the integrability , or not , of the model in question .",
    "hence to study this further we have decided to look in detail on the emission of radiation in the models of bazeia et al .",
    "thus we have examined in detail the scattering properties of solitons for @xmath50 .",
    "first we looked at the values of the critical velocity for the hole of depth = -0.50 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath51 ) .",
    "figure 4 gives the plot of these values and we note that the critical velocity is the lowest for @xmath4 .    in order to have a better understanding to our results on the critical velocities , we have looked into the energy of solitons after the scattering when they are already far away from the hole .",
    "the total energy of the solitons after the scattering is given by    @xmath52    we have estimated the ratios of the radiation to the vibrational energies .",
    "table 1 presents the results of our calculations .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     clearly , both sets of values of critical velocities are in a very good agreement . at the same time , the facts that the approximate value is lower , but only marginally so , and the value of this difference , shows that the radiation effects are very small though , strictly speaking , nonzero .",
    "we have also looked at the scattering of solitons on holes and barriers in the second class of models of bazeia et al .",
    "most of the behaviour was very similar to what was seen in the first class of models ( _ i.e. _ the existence of critical velocities , transmission and reflections on barriers etc ) .",
    "but there were also some small differences .",
    "hence here we restrict our discussion to the description of these differences .",
    "the main reason for these differences resides in the form of the soliton field itself , and the fact that , as shown in figure 2 , the fields are very asymmetric with respect to their behaviour as @xmath53 . clearly as @xmath0 increases",
    "the fields go to different , and decreasing values as @xmath54 .",
    "similarly , as @xmath0 increases , they go to 0 much more slowly .",
    "hence the energy densities of the solitons are more spread out , as shown in figure 11 .",
    "= 4,5,6.,width=302 ]    moreover , like for the first class of models , the rest masses of solitons decrease with @xmath0 , but this time this decrease is faster . in fig 12 .",
    "we present the rest mass energies of solitons as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "clearly , we see a big decrease as @xmath0 increases .    as we will show below the tail of solitons in class ii models , except for @xmath2 when the model reduces to the sine - gordon one , affects the behaviour of solitons when they scatter on a potential hole .",
    "the effect increases with @xmath0 as for larger @xmath0 solitons are more spread out and also are less massive .    in figure 11 we plot the energy densities of the soliton solutions of type ii models .",
    "we only plot them for @xmath55 and @xmath56 as the energy densities for lower values on @xmath0 are much larger so that plotting them all together would make the plots of larger @xmath0 almost invisible .    a note on the normalisation .",
    "as we said before the @xmath1 type i model and @xmath2 type ii one are the same - in fact they both correspond to the sine - gordon model . however , our values of their enegies are different ( in the type i case the rest energy is 0.5 , while in the type ii it is 2.0 ) .",
    "the difference comes from the different normalisation of both models ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "= 1, ... ,6.,width=302 ]    figures 13 and 14 present the plots of the critical velocities when the solitons are scattered from a hole of -0.5 depth and a barrier of 0.4 height , respectively .",
    "the tail , as we have observed in our numerical simulations , is the main part of the solitons that is the most affected when the solitons are scattered on a hole .",
    "more precisely , our simulations have shown that the front part of the soliton is less affected by the hole while the tail , which is its rear part , is more affected by it .",
    "this is due to the asymmetry of the soliton field configuration which generates this asymmetry of the energy density of the soliton .",
    "thus , for example , the energy radiated by the soliton comes mainly from the tail .",
    "when the velocity of the incoming soliton is close to its critical value the tail get badly deformed and the energy radiated from the tail is large . below the critical velocity , _",
    "i.e. _ when the soliton gets trapped inside the hole we have sometimes observed that the peak of the radiated energy is greater than the maximum of energy density of the soliton itself . in such cases",
    "one might even observe a false quantum - like reflection .",
    "this false reflection can be observed numerically unless one is careful and looks at the fields in some detail . while the soliton is inside the hole the magnitude of the back radiation may suggest its reflection",
    ". only careful analysis of such a case would clarify the situation . in one case to be absolutely certain what has happened we had to make the hole very wide to be certain that the soliton remained trapped in it .",
    "this was the case , for example , when we looked at the @xmath58 model and the soliton was sent with velocity @xmath59 towards a hole of depth -0.5 .",
    "this soliton got trapped inside the hole and radiated away a very large amount of radiation .",
    "figure 13 shows the energy density seen in this case when the radiated energy which has travelled backwards is higher than the main energy of soliton which is trapped inside the hole .",
    "one can also see from this figure that the front part of the soliton has not shown any significan deformation while the tail part of the energy density has been deformed greatly and has given off almost all the radiated energy .",
    "= 6.,width=170 ]    we have also observed that in the cases when the velocity is below its critical values the front part of the soliton including its centre of mass can exit the hole while the tail still remains inside it .",
    "then , because the tail has remained in the hole , the soliton gets pulled back into the hole and so remains trapped inside it .",
    "we have considered two classes of topological soliton models , presented by bazeia et al @xcite which are generalisations of the sine - gordon model .",
    "both classes depend on an integer parameter @xmath0 which , for the type i models reduces to the sine - gordon model when @xmath1 , while in the type ii case the sine - gordon case corresponds to @xmath0=1 .",
    "both classes of models have shown a behaviour which is similar to what was observed in the sine - gordon case in some recent research work , namely that the scattering by a hole is inelastic while the scattering by a barrier is nearly elastic . during the scattering on barriers",
    "the solitons behave very much like point - like particles .",
    "their initial kinetic energy is converted into the potential energy needed to overcome the barrier and there is very little energy left to excite the internal degrees of freedom of the soliton .",
    "this has been confirmed by our estimates of the critical velocities for the transmission over the barrier which is based on this assumption .",
    "we have shown this to be true in all models ( _ i.e. _ for all values of @xmath0 ) .",
    "the scattering on the holes is different . when a soliton enters a hole it gains an extra energy which is then , in part , converted into the energy of internal oscillations",
    "this is again seen for all the models we have looked at .",
    "why this extra energy is used this way is not completely clear at the moment .",
    "we have tried to find an explanation in terms of equipartition of energy etc but have not managed to prove that this is really the case .",
    "hence this explanation is still lacking and our results have shown that this is a general phenomenon as the excitation of the internal degrees of freedom takes place in the all models studied by us and is more or less similar in magnitude .",
    "we have also seen that the energy of solitons after the scattering is distributed differently into the vibrational and radiation energies .",
    "and so the soliton which converts most of its extra energy into the vibrational energy , rather than the radiation energy , is more able to be transmitted over the obstruction with the least velocity .",
    "solitons of the type - ii models , except for the sine - gordon case ( @xmath2 ) , have asymmetrical field configurations and have exhibited what we have called the tail effect in their scattering on potential holes .",
    "the perturbation due to the potential hole has an uneven effect on the body of solitons .",
    "while it produces very little deformation or the radiation in the front part of the solitons , their tails are greatly deformed and most of the radiation is produced there too .",
    "when the initial velocities of the solitons are close to their critical values , the radition energy , which is sent backwards , is very large and often more peaked than the energy density of the soliton itself .",
    "this could easily lead to some misunderstanding of what has happened ; _",
    "i.e. _ one may think that one has observed a quantum - like reflection while in reality this was only a trapping accompanied by some radiation sent backwards .",
    "solitons , in some cases , behave like particles because of their localized structure . however , because of their extened structure they deviate from their particle behaviour in other cases .",
    "the symmetrical or asymmetrical field configurations play a great role on how the perturbations affect the solitons and the amount of radiation that is produced .    when a topological soliton ( corresponding to @xmath21 ) is placed inside a potential hole it has an extra energy .",
    "this energy is then transfered into its vibrational energy but some of it is radiated off . moreover ,",
    "when we looked at the energy of solitons scattered by a hole we have found it to be almost the same as the energy of the solitons before the scattering although the final solitons were moving with somewhat smaller velocities .",
    "this implies that the scattering generated very little radiation ( _ i.e. _ also when the solitons were in the hole ) and that most of the extra energy was converted into the vibrational / excitation energy of the solitons and suprising little was sent off as radiation .",
    "we have also observed that for @xmath4 type i model , the critical velocity is the least for all the cases we have looked at when considering the scattering of a soliton on a hole of -0.5 depth or on a barrier of 0.4 height .",
