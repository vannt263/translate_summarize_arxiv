    "for many years , the evolution of galaxies has been estimated through the use of galaxy counts ( see the review by koo & kron 1992 ) , and , more recently , using luminosity functions ( _ e.g. _ , lilly 1995 ) . however , such data do not uniquely constrain the luminosity evolution because of the unknown distribution of galaxy masses in a given sample , since @xmath22 varies greatly with star - formation history",
    ". measurements of the mass scales of distant galaxies can remove this ambiguity by allowing one to observe @xmath22 ratios and provide a direct , unambiguous measure of the luminosity evolution .",
    "reliable estimates of the mass scales of galaxies at high redshifts can routinely be made using the high spatial resolution imaging cameras on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , and efficient ground - based spectrographs on 8 - 10 m telescopes .",
    "hst data provide the requisite length scales , and the spectrographs on 8 - 10 m telescopes enable us to accurately measure internal kinematics .",
    "together , one can directly measure @xmath22 ratios through the use of galaxy scaling relations in a manner consistent with previous work on large samples of nearby galaxies .",
    "these scaling relations , such as the tully - fisher relation for spirals ( @xcite ) , the faber - jackson relation for ellipticals ( @xcite ) , or the fundamental plane of early - type galaxies ( @xcite ) , are essentially relations between @xmath22 ratio and galaxy mass . using such relations , one can directly probe the evolution of @xmath22 ratios for galaxies at high redshift , and set powerful constraints on the evolution and formation histories of normal galaxies .",
    "the fundamental plane ( fp ) is an empirical relation between half - light radius , @xmath23 , surface brightness , @xmath24 , and central velocity dispersion , @xmath4 for early - type galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fp is a refinement of the faber - jackson relation . using a large sample of e and s0 galaxies in 11 clusters , jrgensen , franx , & kjrgaard ( 1996 ) found , for 226 galaxies in gunn @xmath25 and 109 in gunn @xmath26 , @xmath27 under the assumption of homology",
    ", the fp implies that @xmath22 ratio is a tight function of galaxy structural parameters , such that , in gunn @xmath25 , @xmath28 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fundamental plane is very thin ( @xcite ) , with an observed  scatter of @xmath29 in coma in @xmath30-band @xmath22 ratio at a given @xmath31 ( @xcite ) .    by measuring a large sample of early - type galaxies at high redshift ( _ i.e. _ , at large look - back time )",
    ", one can use the evolution of @xmath22 ratios and the evolution of the scatter in @xmath22 to infer the star - formation histories of early - type galaxies . in this way ,",
    "one directly measures the star - formation history of the universe in high - density regions ( where early - type galaxies are predominantly found , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "franx ( 1993 , 1995 ) and van dokkum & franx ( 1996 ) used the mmt to obtain spectroscopy of several early - type galaxies in the clusters a665 ( @xmath32 ) and cl0024 + 16 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "they used structural parameters from hst imaging , and velocity dispersions from the spectroscopy , to derive @xmath22 ratios for early - type galaxies in those clusters . due to the low internal scatter in the fundamental plane , even these few observations sufficed to measure mild evolution in the @xmath22 ratios as a function of redshift .",
    "several other authors have now measured elliptical galaxy scaling relations at intermediate redshifts and have confirmed mild ( passive ) stellar evolution out to moderate redshifts ( @xmath34 ; @xcite ) .",
    "kelson  ( 1997 ) extended the fundamental plane measurements to cl1358 + 62 ( @xmath0 ) and ms205304 ( @xmath35 ) and confirmed the moderate @xmath22 evolution .",
    "those authors also suggested that the evolution in the scatter is likely to be quite low .",
    "here , we present the analysis of a larger sample of more than 50 galaxies in cl1358 + 62 at @xmath0 . the spectroscopy and surface photometry",
    "are discussed by kelson  ( 1999a , b ) . using these data",
    ", we now analyze the fundamental plane in the cluster , with the goal of addressing the following issues :    \\(1 ) what is the form of the fundamental plane at high redshift ? does the slope evolve with redshift ? what is the scatter , and",
    "does it evolve with redshift ?",
    "is there simply a @xmath22 zero - point shift ?",
    "\\(2 ) is there any _ morphological _ dependence in the fundamental plane at high redshift , since large , nearby samples show no obvious dependence or difference between s0s and ellipticals ( @xcite ) ?",
    "\\(3 ) do @xmath6 ratios , for a given galaxy mass , correlate with known stellar population indicators , such as @xmath13 color , or with structural indicators , such as apparent ellipticity or profile shape ?",
    "\\(4 ) how do `` e+a ''",
    "galaxies relate to the typical early - type cluster members ?",
    "e+a galaxies have spectra which appear to be superpositions of an old early - type stellar population , and a young 1 - 2 gyr - old stellar population ( @xcite ) . do these e+a galaxies have any immediate connection to the present - day s0 population ( franx 1993 ) ?",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in  [ data ] , we outline the selection and nature of the sample . in  [ fpsec ] ,",
    "the fundamental plane of the early - type galaxies is fit to the data , the s0s are compared to the ellipticals , and the intrinsic scatter about the fundamental plane is measured . in  [ es0pops ] , we discuss the early - type galaxy @xmath6 ratios and their implications for the stellar populations .",
    "in particular , we derive the evolution in @xmath6 with respect to the early - types in coma ; derive the extent to which stellar populations are varying along the fundamental plane ; and determine the nature of the scatter in the fundamental plane and color - magnitude relations . in ",
    "[ spiral ] , the fundamental plane of the early - type spirals is discussed , and their @xmath6 ratios are compared to those of the e / s0s . in  [ models ] , population synthesis models are used to investigate the differences between the stellar populations of the spirals and early - types , with the goal of determining whether or not intermediate redshift spirals can evolve into contemporary s0s .",
    "our conclusions will be summarized in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we are currently studying the galaxy populations of three clusters in detail , cl1358 + 62 ( @xmath0 ) , ms205304 ( @xmath35 ) , and ms105403 ( @xmath36 ) , selected from the einstein medium sensitivity survey ( @xcite ) . during cycle 5 , a mosaic of twelve hst wfpc2 pointings of cl1358 + 62 was taken in two filters , f606w and f814w .",
    "these data were presented in van dokkum  ( 1998a ) .",
    "a large number of redshifts in the cluster has been compiled by fisher  ( 1998 ) , who defined membership between @xmath37 . using 232 cluster members within a @xmath38 field of view , they found a velocity dispersion for the cluster of @xmath39 ( see fisher  ( 1998 ) and fabricant  ( 1999 ) for discussions about the spatial and kinematic distributions broken down by spectroscopic and morphological classifications ) . for fundamental plane analysis",
    ", we randomly selected cluster members within the field of view of the hst mosaic , to @xmath40 mag .",
    "the selection was performed with an effort to efficiently construct multi - slit plates for the low - resolution imaging spectrograph ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used three masks , with different position angles on the sky .",
    "the region of maximum overlap is in the center of the cluster , and thus the fp sample is concentrated towards the core of the cluster .",
    "morphology was not a factor in the selection of our sample . in the random selection process ,",
    "three e+a galaxies were included ; these will be compared with those cluster members that have normal , early - type spectra .",
    "the sample is about @xmath41 complete for @xmath42 mag ( see @xcite for details on the statistical completeness of the original redshift catalog ) .",
    "three galaxies fainter than @xmath43 mag were added to test the quality of velocity dispersion measurements at faint magnitude limits .",
    "the spectroscopic reductions are detailed in kelson  ( 1999a ) . in total",
    ", we have central velocity dispersions for 55 galaxies in the cluster .",
    "kelson  measured central velocity dispersions within an approximately @xmath44 aperture and corrected the values for aperture size to a nominal circular aperture of @xmath45 at the distance of coma .",
    "kelson  ( 1999a ) also showed that the kinematic profiles of the cl1358 + 62 members are similar to nearby early - type galaxies , ensuring that the aperture corrections derived from nearby galaxies remain valid for the @xmath0 data .",
    "furthermore , the e / s0s and early - type spirals have similar kinematic profiles , over the aperture that kelson  ( 1999a ) used , ensuring that the velocity dispersion aperture corrections do not depend strongly on morphology .",
    "the derivation of structural parameters from the hst imaging is discussed in kelson  ( 1999b ) .",
    "unfortunately , two of the galaxies were imaged too close to the wfpc2 ccd edges to obtain reliable structural parameters .",
    "thus , there are a total of 53 cluster members in our determination of the fundamental plane in cl1358 + 62 .",
    "as was mentioned earlier , three galaxies have e+a spectra as defined by the criterion of fisher  ( 1998 ) , in which @xmath46   and [ oii ] 3727   @xmath47  . the e+a fraction of our sample ( 6% ) is representative of the cluster ( 5% ; @xcite ) .",
    "two of the 53 galaxies show evidence of current star formation activity , with balmer and [ oiii ] emission ( the cd , # 375 ; and the sb , # 234 )",
    ". fisher  ( 1998 ) report an emission - line galaxy fraction of @xmath48 in the field of the hst mosaic down to @xmath49 mag . in the sample presented here , the fraction is about half that ( a @xmath50 difference ) , though the emission - line galaxies are more common in the outer parts of the cluster .",
    "although the cd shows evidence for emission in its central parts , we consider it `` normal '' and spectroscopically early - type for the fundamental plane .",
    "optical morphologies have been taken from fabricant  ( 1999 ) .",
    "these authors classified several hundred galaxies in the hst mosaic according to morphological type , @xmath51 . the galaxies in our high - resolution spectroscopic sample",
    "have @xmath52 ( e , e / s0 , s0 , s0/a , sa , sab , sb , respectively ) . the galaxy morphologies are listed in table [ table ] , in which there are 11 es , 6 e / s0s , 14 s0s , 13 s0/as , 6 sas , 2 sabs , and 1 sb . this distribution is quite similar to nearby massive clusters ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "note that the classification scheme employed in fabricant  ( 1999 ) is not identical to that applied in van dokkum  ( 1998a ) .",
    "the latter authors classified galaxies based on whether or not they had any obvious disk structure , and did not attempt to classify their galaxies according to the traditional hubble scheme .",
    "the photometric parameters were derived from the deep wfpc2 data .",
    "the surface photometry was transformed to johnson @xmath30 , redshifted to the frame of the galaxies .",
    "such a transformation is necessary to facilitate a direct comparison of our sample with nearby galaxies .",
    "details of the transformation are given in van dokkum & franx ( 1996 ) and kelson  ( 1999b ) .",
    "the formal uncertainties in the individual structural parameters do not fairly represent the true errors in the fundamental plane determination .",
    "random and systematic errors in @xmath23 and @xmath53 can be quite large , but their combined error in the fundamental plane is quite small , at the level of a few percent ( see @xcite and , for example , the detailed analysis presented in @xcite ) .",
    "the structural parameters were derived using three different profiles : ( 1 ) the de vaucouleurs @xmath54-law ; ( 2 ) generalized @xmath55-laws ( @xcite ) ; and ( 3 ) @xmath54-law bulge plus exponential disk superpositions . therefore , for each galaxy we have three sets of structural parameters . in  [ quant ] and [ residuals ] , we investigate the utility of these different profiles , for purposes of morphological classification , or for determining accurate half - light radii and surface brightnesses .    the galaxy parameters used in the following analysis are listed in table [ table ] . included",
    "are the optical morphologies , the @xmath56 shape parameters , central velocity dispersions , @xmath23 and @xmath57 from the @xmath54-law fit , @xmath58 magnitude from fabricant  ( 1991 ) , and restframe @xmath13 colors from van dokkum  ( 1998a ) .",
    "all three , different sets of structural parameters are listed in kelson ( 1999b ) .",
    "they are not critical for the conclusions of this paper .",
    "the fundamental plane is a power - law relation between effective radius , @xmath23 , central velocity dispersion , @xmath4 , and mean surface brightness , @xmath59 , within @xmath23 , of the following form : @xmath60 for the present analysis , we follow the procedures of jrgensen  ( 1996 ) , who found the best - fit plane through the data by minimizing the average absolute residual , perpendicular to the fitted plane .",
    "this method has the advantage of being robust against outliers .",
    "similar to minimizing @xmath61 using a gradient search algorithm , we search the parameter space of @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the values which minimize @xmath64 where the denominator arises from the rotation of the residuals in @xmath65 to a vector normal to the plane .",
    "this choice is also motivated , in part , by our desire to compare our results to the extensive work by jrgensen . in the fitting of a plane to three dimensional data , with correlated and uncorrelated errors",
    ", no single fitting procedure will accurately recover the underlying relation .",
    "an accurate determination of the true physical relation requires sophisticated modeling and knowledge of the underlying distribution of galaxy parameters , all of which are beyond the scope of this paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "as was mentioned earlier , jrgensen  ( 1996 ) found @xmath66 , @xmath67 in gunn @xmath26 using 109 galaxies in nearby clusters .",
    "we adopt these values for the local slope of the fundamental plane , as gunn @xmath26 more closely matches the johnson @xmath30-band , than does gunn @xmath25 .",
    "nevertheless , one should note that the slopes for the local fundamental plane do not differ greatly between the two bandpasses and our conclusions in this paper are not sensitive to this choice .",
    "uncertainties in the values of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath68 are estimated by the bootstrap method ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "such uncertainties represent the formal errors in the fit , when performed in the manner we have adopted ( minimizing the absolute residuals ) .",
    "systematic errors in the coefficients of the fundamental plane can arise from many sources , such as the selection criteria , the correlated measurement errors , and the choice of the fitting procedure itself ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , differences in fitting techniques can lead to small changes in the coefficients on the order of @xmath69 or so .",
    "thus , the fitting procedures of jrgensen  ( 1996 ) were adopted partly so that this systematic effect would be minimized in our measurement of evolution in the coefficients .",
    "the systematic effects arising from selection biases and correlated measurement errors are still being explored , and will be published later ( @xcite ) .    the scatter about the best - fit plane will be reported either in units of @xmath23 at fixed @xmath4 and @xmath24 , or in units of @xmath6 at fixed @xmath4 and @xmath23 . under the assumption of homology , the observed quantities @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath4 relate to real physical properties of size , surface brightness , and total second velocity moment , in the same manner for all early - type galaxies .",
    "thus , one can use the fundamental plane of the ellipticals to transform the virial theorem @xmath70 into @xmath71 in gunn @xmath26 the slopes for early - type galaxies of jrgensen ( 1996 ) yield @xmath72    these equations enable us to express the fundamental plane residuals in units of @xmath22 ratio : @xmath73    because the absolute residuals have been minimized , the  scatter about any given fit is not .",
    "we therefore refrain from writing the scatter as an  value , and instead report estimates of the 1-@xmath4 scatter using @xmath74 the average absolute deviation , either in @xmath23 or in @xmath6 . for a gaussian distribution of residuals ,",
    "this estimate for the scatter is equivalent to the standard deviation .",
    "we find similar results when using the bi - weight statistic ( @xcite ) , and conclude that our estimate of the scatter is robust .    in constructing the figures , we express @xmath23 in units of kpc , and @xmath24 , the mean surface brightness within an effective radius , in units of @xmath75 in the @xmath30-band .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we use @xmath76 -1 and @xmath8 , defining a scale of 4.8 kpc / arcsec .      in figure [ view1 ] , we show the fundamental plane of early - type galaxies .",
    "the long , intermediate , short edge - on projections , and the face - on projection are shown in fig .",
    "[ view1](a - d ) .",
    "there is a tight relation , offset from the relation defined by the early - type galaxies of coma ( @xcite ) . in [ view1](d ) , the `` zone of avoidance '' ( @xcite ) is the region in the upper right which contains no galaxies . note that the cl1358 + 62 early - type galaxies have a different distribution than the coma galaxies : the cl1358 + 62 galaxies lie at slightly higher surface brightnesses .",
    "we will come back to this point later .",
    "the fundamental plane of the 30 e , e / s0 , and s0 galaxies ( not including any galaxies with e+a spectra ) is described by @xmath77 the 1-@xmath4 scatter is only @xmath5 in @xmath23 . using equation [ eq : mlres ] , one obtains @xmath78 with a scatter of about @xmath79 in @xmath6 ratio .",
    "the scatter in @xmath6 is @xmath80 when using the locally defined gunn @xmath26 slopes .",
    "the values obtained above for the slope do not significantly differ from that found locally , either in gunn @xmath26 or gunn @xmath25 ( see above ) . comparing equation [ mlpred ] to the local expectation in gunn @xmath26",
    ", one finds that the slope of the fundamental plane has not significantly evolved from the present - day : @xmath81    both van dokkum & franx ( 1996 ) and kelson  ( 1997 ) noted that the intermediate redshift fp slope may not be the same as that found locally .",
    "the advantage of the work presented here is the depth and size of the sample , which allows for a more detailed breakdown by morphological type .",
    "kelson ( 1998 , 1999 ) show that a shallow magnitude cut - off in the selection process can lead to a flattening of the fitted fundamental plane slope , similar to other malmquist - like regression biases .",
    "such an effect probably led to the mild change in slope observed by kelson  ( 1997 ) and van dokkum & franx ( 1996 ) .",
    "we tested the robustness of the slope to the morphological classifications . using the sersic ( 1968 ) profile shape parameters @xmath56 as a classification tool , the plane of the 30 galaxies with @xmath82 are best fit by @xmath83 and @xmath84 . using the 1d bulge - disk decompositions , the plane of the 25 galaxies with bulge fractions greater than 90% are best fit by @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "recall that the visually classified e / s0s galaxies produced slopes of @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we conclude that our measured fundamental plane slopes are not affected by uncertainties in the morphological classifications .    since the slopes we have determined for",
    "the cl1358 + 62 fp do not differ significantly from that found by jrgensen  ( 1996 ) , as given earlier , we continue our analysis using the locally defined values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the remaining conclusions of this paper are not sensitive to the adoption of these values over the ones measured above .      for nearby s0s ,",
    "the zero - point and scatter of the fundamental plane is the same as that for ellipticals ( @xcite ) . using either the fundamental plane coefficients defined by the 30 cl1358 + 62 early - types , or the ones defined locally , the 11 ellipticals have the same zero - point as the 13 non - e+a s0s .",
    "this is fully consistent with what has been found in nearby clusters .",
    "there remains , however , the question of whether the slope of the fundamental plane of the s0s is the same as that of the ellipticals .",
    "the 11 visually classified ellipticals yield @xmath91 and @xmath92 with a 1-@xmath4 scatter of @xmath93 in @xmath23 .",
    "there appears to be no significant change in the slope by removing the one elliptical fainter than the magnitude limit and exclusion of the cd does not significantly affect the slope either . by fitting a plane to the 13 non - e+a s0s in cl1358 + 62 , we find @xmath94 , @xmath95 , with a scatter of @xmath96 .",
    "the difference in scatter is not statistically significant .",
    "because the distinction between e and s0 can become more difficult at higher redshift , we have also divided the sample of 53 galaxies by bulge - to - disk ratio , derived from fitting two - component @xmath54-law bulge and disk growth curves to surface photometry ( @xcite ) .",
    "no significant difference in the fundamental plane slopes are seen for any of these subsets .    as a result of these tests ,",
    "we conclude that differences between the coefficients of the fp relations of the s0s and es , if any , are too subtle to be accurately measured with the current sample .      in cosmological models involving hierarchical merging of gas - rich systems ,",
    "early - type galaxies are expected to have some intrinsic scatter in the properties of their stellar populations ( @xcite,1996 ) .",
    "such variations would manifest themselves in a scatter in the colors , absorption line strengths , and @xmath6 ratios of early - type galaxies at a given luminosity , galaxy mass , or velocity dispersion ( @xcite ) .",
    "evidence for a spread in the properties of stellar populations has been measured using the scatter about the color - magnitude relation ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "we have measured the scatter in colors about the color - magnitude relation for the galaxies in our sample and find an _ intrinsic _",
    "1-@xmath97 scatter in color , at a given mass , of @xmath98 mag ( see @xcite )",
    ". using the gissel96 ( @xcite ) single burst stellar populations with a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function ( imf ) , and assuming that variations in age are the cause of these residuals , this scatter in color is equivalent to a scatter in @xmath6 of @xmath99 .",
    "equation [ eq : mlres ] showed that variations in @xmath6 ratios of stellar populations , at a given @xmath23 and @xmath4 will lead to scatter in the fundamental plane .",
    "residuals from the fundamental plane can be caused by a number of other effects as well , such as variations in elliptical galaxy shapes , metal abundance , and dust content .",
    "in contrast , the scatter in the color - magnitude relation may only be due to variations in stellar populations and/or dust content .",
    "some have also suggested that correlations between age , other stellar population properties , and/or galaxy structural parameters may be conspiring to reduce the scatter in the fundamental plane and color - magnitude relations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . jrgensen  ( 1996 ) have limited to what extent random projection can inflate the scatter of the fundamental plane to less than 6% in @xmath22 ratio .",
    "together , the scatter in the fundamental plane and color - magnitude relations can be used to constrain the properties of the stellar populations .",
    "the ellipticals and s0s have an observed 1-@xmath4 scatter about the fp of @xmath79 in @xmath6 .",
    "the observational errors in our data are a small component of the observed scatter . as shown in kelson ( 1999a ) , the formal velocity dispersion uncertainties range from @xmath100 . because of template mismatch , the true errors are more like @xmath101 .",
    "the fundamental plane parameters , @xmath102 , have random errors of @xmath103 ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the contribution to the observed scatter from measurement errors is approximately @xmath104 in @xmath23 ( @xmath96 in @xmath6 ) . removing this in quadrature",
    "gives an intrinsic scatter in @xmath6 of @xmath5 .",
    "that the intrinsic scatter in @xmath6 should agree so well with the naive expectation from the scatter in colors is remarkable .",
    "moreover , the intrinsic scatter of @xmath105 is an upper limit to the scatter in the stellar populations because there may be other sources of scatter in the observed @xmath6 ratios , due to variations , for example , in galactic structure .",
    "the zero - point of the fundamental plane is related to the mean @xmath22 ratio of a sample of early - type galaxies .",
    "evolution in the luminosity - weighted mean properties of stellar populations therefore implies evolution in the fp zero - point .",
    "although modest evolution of the fp zero - point has already been demonstrated ( @xcite ) , these new data can improve upon the accuracy of the results in kelson , and test the sensitivity to small number statistics and sample biases .",
    "we use a sample of early - type galaxies in coma to define the present - day zero - point of the fundamental plane .",
    "these data are a subset of the large gunn @xmath25 sample in jrgensen  ( 1996 ) that also had the required color information to transform the surface brightnesses to the @xmath30-band .",
    "this @xmath30-band coma sample is shown in figures [ view1](a - d ) by the small triangles .",
    "note that the cl1358 + 62 early - types are shifted by a small amount with respect to the coma early - types .",
    "the trend appears to be towards increasing surface brightnesses , suggesting that at least some of the shift in @xmath22 derives from luminosity evolution .",
    "if the ranges of galaxy masses in coma and cl1358 + 62 are substantially different , which was the case for the small samples in van dokkum & franx ( 1996 ) , kelson  ( 1997 ) and van dokkum  ( 1998b ) , then the offset in @xmath6 can be very sensitive to the adopted slopes of the fundamental plane . this sensitivity arises because the fundamental plane is essentially a relation between @xmath6 ratio and galaxy mass .",
    "if one compares two samples of galaxies with substantially different mass functions , then any derived offset in @xmath6 is going to be a combination of the true offset , the differences in fp slope , and the difference in the mean mass of the sample . by minimizing the differences between the mass distributions ,",
    "one eliminates this latter term , and the results become insensitive to the slope of the fp .",
    "therefore , when deriving the offsets , we restrict the local calibrating sample to a similar mass range as in cl1358 + 62 .",
    "such a restriction on the local sample implies that any measured evolution is relevant for galaxies within a specific range of masses .    in figure",
    "[ mass ] , we show the distributions of the cl1358 + 62 galaxies overlayed with the coma @xmath30-band sample in the @xmath106-@xmath65 plane .",
    "the dashed lines show contours of constant mass ( @xmath107 , @xcite ) .",
    "the distributions are remarkably similar , ensuring that our measurement of the @xmath6 evolution will not be biased by any differences between the two distributions of galaxy masses .    using the 30 early - type galaxies , we find that the @xmath6 ratios , for a given @xmath23 and @xmath4 , are offset by @xmath108 ( @xmath8 ; @xmath109 dex for @xmath110 ) .",
    "the errors listed are the formal errors in the offset .",
    "we test the sensitivity of this result to the morphological classifications by using only the es and find no significant difference . changing the adopted slope from the jrgensen  ( 1996 ) gunn @xmath26 values to those for gunn",
    "@xmath25 changes the results by @xmath111 dex . using the values found in in  [ fpsec ]",
    "also produces no significant change in the result as well .",
    "kelson  ( 1997 ) had found @xmath112 dex .",
    "the difference can be attributed to improvements in the size and depth of the sample .",
    "we can use the simple , single - burst models of  [ models ] to infer the relative age difference between the coma and cl1358 + 62 early - types . assuming that the early - type galaxies in both clusters have had similar formation histories and adopting a salpeter imf , the cl1358 + 62 early - type galaxies have ages in the mean which are @xmath113 ( @xmath8 ; @xmath114 for @xmath110 ) of the mean ages of their counterparts in coma , for galaxies of the same @xmath23 and @xmath4 .",
    "these uncertainties are the internal errors alone .",
    "the external errors account for another 5 - 10% .",

    "any or all of these may be in effect , but they must be correlated with the structural parameters in order for the fundamental plane of the spirals to be so well - defined .",
    "inhomogeneities in any of these properties are likely to be be present as well , given the large scatter shown above",

    "we tested whether using a pure @xmath54-law surface brightness profile to derive structural parameters might have caused the additional scatter and tilt for the fp of the spirals .",

    "the data do not follow the predicted curves in any sensible way . for example the spirals do not behave as flattened rotators in this diagram , presumably because their residuals are dominated by stellar population effects ( see below )",
    ".      for the spiral galaxies in cl1358 + 62 , figure [ deviate1](e ) shows that the residuals from the fundamental plane of the early - types is strongly correlated with central velocity dispersion .",
    "this correlation might suggest that central measurements of the velocity dispersion do not relate to the virial mass in the same way for the spirals as for the e / s0s . while it seems reasonable to expect that spiral galaxies are not homologous with e / s0s , kelson  ( 1999a ) showed that the rotation curves of the two families are similar , at least to radii of approximately @xmath172 , at the level of a few percent .",

    "we now explore to what extent the observed correlation in figure [ deviate1](f ) may be metallicity dependent . if the residuals are due to a systematic trend with @xmath203 , then , using equations [ bzml ] and [ bzbv ] , @xmath204 for a sample of galaxies whose mean metallicity is solar , then @xmath205 .",
    "this prediction is ruled out by the least - squares fit to figure [ deviate1](f ) at the 3-@xmath4 level .",
    "we therefore conclude that it is the presence of young stellar populations in the spirals which in turn produce a systematic deviation of the low velocity dispersion spirals from the fundamental plane of the ellipticals .",
    "future analysis of the metal line strengths will help determine to what extent the imf may differ from the one adopted in the models , and to what extent metallicity variations are present in our sample .",
    "in equation [ eq : age ] we showed the correlation expected between fp and cm residuals for old stellar populations , when variations in mean luminosity - weighted age are the primary cause of the residuals .",
    "recall that the observed correlation for the spirals was @xmath206 .",
    "using this correlation , the single - burst models imply @xmath207 an imf with @xmath121 implies @xmath208 , ruling out the worthey ( 1994 ) `` @xmath209 '' rule by nearly 3-@xmath4 .",
    "if this `` 3/2 '' rule is true , then the slope of the imf ( still parameterized as a single power - law ) must be @xmath210 .",
    "analysis of the line - strengths is required to fully understand any correlations between luminosity - weighted age and metallicity , as well as conclusively test for variations in the initial mass function .",
    "though the spirals fp is tilted with respect to the plane of the ellipticals , this can be accounted for using stellar population models",
    ". however , the residuals about the corrected plane are still quite large",
    ". this remaining scatter could be due to additional random variations in the stellar populations , such as from metallicity , or other unknown factors such as galaxy shapes , or even variable dust content .",
    "the fundamental plane in the cluster cl1358 + 62 has been measured using accurate internal kinematics and structural parameters . in total , we have 53 cluster members , three of which have e+a spectra , and one which has emission lines , indicative of star - formation . of the 53 ,",
    "31 have been classified as e , e / s0 , or s0 galaxies .",
    "there are 13 s0/a galaxies , 6 with sa morphology , two sab galaxies , and 1 sb . because our sample was selected without the use of morphology , we have made a thorough analysis of the cluster population as a whole .",
    "several conclusions can be drawn from the current data .",
    "\\(1 )  the 30 e , e / s0 , and s0s which do not have e+a spectra or strong emission lines follow a relation which is similar in form to that found in nearby clusters : @xmath211 using these slopes , the ellipticals and s0s give identical fundamental plane zero - points , similar to the ellipticals and s0s in nearby clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "fitting individual relations to the visually classified ellipticals and s0s does not produce significantly different results .",
    "\\(2 )  the @xmath6 ratios of the cl1358 + 62 early - types are lower than those in coma by @xmath212 dex ( @xmath8 , @xmath109 dex for @xmath110 ) .",
    "the look - back time to cl1358 + 62 , about a third the present age of the universe , is therefore equivalent to about @xmath115 of the lifespan of nearby cluster galaxies , in agreement with a high mean redshift of formation for the stars in e / s0s .",
    "this comparison assumes that these es and s0s in cl1358 + 62 are co - eval with those in coma .",
    "if any contemporary e / s0 galaxies possessed later - type morphologies at intermediate redshifts , they would not have been included in the determination of this offset .",
    "therefore , the measured @xmath6 offset may only reflect a subset of contemporary e / s0 galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "\\(3 )  the stellar populations of early - type galaxies vary along the fundamental plane such that @xmath213 .",
    "the current data are not sufficient to specify to what extent this correlation derives from age and/or metallicity variations . if one corrects the surface brightnesses of the e / s0s for the observed correlation , the resulting plane agrees with the expectation predicted by the virial theorem and homology ( @xmath214 ) .",
    "this result suggests that early - type galaxies form an homologous family .",
    "\\(4 )  the e / s0 galaxies have an intrinsic 1-@xmath4 scatter of 14% in @xmath30-band @xmath22 ratio about the local fp slope .",
    "this scatter is consistent with the scatter in the color - magnitude relation ( @xcite ) , assuming that it is caused by a scatter in the luminosity - weighted ages of the stellar populations .",
    "the implication is that the cl1358 + 62 elliptical galaxies would have a scatter in mean luminosity - weighted ages of 15% , depending on the shape of the imf .",
    "the implication is that nearly all of the star - formation in the cl1358 + 62 e / s0s was finished by @xmath215",
    ". measurements of balmer and metal line strengths are required to fully understand to what extent random variations in age and metal abundance are causing scatter in the two scaling relations .",
    "\\(5 )  the early - type spirals follow a different fundamental plane relation from the ellipticals and s0s . given this , we studied the residuals of the spirals with respect to the fundamental plane of the ellipticals and find that the residuals of the spirals correlate with both velocity dispersion and residual from the color - magnitude relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the spirals follow a different plane from the ellipticals and s0s because of a systematic variation of stellar populations with velocity dispersion . after several gyr of passive stellar evolution",
    ", these spirals will follow a plane with the same form as the e / s0s , but with scatter that is twice as large .",
    "\\(6 )  the smooth transition of color and fp residuals towards older ( redder , higher @xmath6 ratio ) spirals indicates that star - formation has been a continuous process for these galaxies .",
    "the galaxies with the most recent star - formation have been intermediate and low velocity dispersion early - type spirals .",
    "the systematic correlation of fp residual with color , and , for example , the strong balmer absorption lines , indicate that cluster spirals have been forming stars up through times as late as @xmath12 .",
    "the spiral galaxies contain composite stellar populations , and their long - term star - formation histories can not be modeled adequately with the current data .",
    "regardless , these galaxies clearly have a broad dispersion in properties , unlike the e / s0 galaxies .",
    "\\(7 )  the correlation of fp residual and color residual for early - type spirals extends to the e+a galaxies , forming a tail in a sequence of recent , or recently extinguished , star - formation .",
    "that the e+a and emission line galaxies are very young and have low velocity dispersions simply places them at the extreme end of a relation between stellar populations and velocity dispersion which is specific to the spiral galaxies .",
    "simple stellar population models imply that the mean luminosity - weighted ages of these spiral galaxies follows @xmath216 thus , an sa galaxy with @xmath138  would be about @xmath115 the mean luminosity - weighted age of an sa with @xmath217 , for a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf . however , this interpretation depends upon whatever systematic variations of luminosity - weighted ages may exist along the fundamental plane of early - type galaxies .",
    "\\(8 )  early - type spirals brighter than @xmath15 at the present epoch must have formed before @xmath218 .",
    "furthermore , the implication of figure [ deviate1](e , f ) is that early - type spirals with @xmath219  should show evidence for more recent star - formation at higher redshifts .",
    "this has been tentatively seen in ms105403 at @xmath36 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "\\(9 )  the e+a galaxies could be as much as three times too bright for their @xmath23 and @xmath4 , compared to an extrapolation of the fundamental plane of the ellipticals .",
    "the e+as are consistent with having a burst of star - formation at @xmath220 .",
    "these data do not place any stronger constraints due to observational errors , and the unknown extent to which the stellar populations are composites of both old and young stars .",
    "the three e+a galaxies in the sample span a range of masses , the highest nearly the mass of an @xmath15 galaxy , down to a full dex below @xmath198 . by @xmath221",
    ", these galaxies will have faded about 1.5 mag and only be @xmath222 mag bluer than local color - magnitude relations ( _ i.e. _ , @xcite ) , assuming these galaxies can be adequately modeled by a single , instantaneous burst .",
    "the e+as have variable bulge fractions , but invariably have disks and are partly supported by rotation ( @xcite , b , @xcite ) .",
    "it is unlikely that they will become present - day ellipticals , but , like the other young spirals in the sample , they may evolve into s0s .",
    "the fundamental plane has become a useful tool for studying the histories of galaxies later than e and s0 ( cf .",
    "the larger spiral fractions in clusters at higher redshift will allow for a better understanding of the evolution and transition of the spiral and early - type populations ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "if there are processes which turn spiral galaxies into s0s between @xmath0 and @xmath197 , then such processes must somehow work to reduce their scatter about the fundamental plane , unless such galaxies were excluded from nearby samples for reasons other than morphology .",
    "future work will be aimed at measuring absorption line strengths and near - ir colors .",
    "together with the @xmath30-band @xmath22 ratios , one will be able to expand the modeling with the goal of disentangling composite stellar populations ( _ e.g. _ , in the e+a galaxies ) , metallicities , dust contamination , the imf , and galaxy shapes .",
    "analysis of the fundamental plane of field galaxies at intermediate redshifts will be a very important step for comparing the evolutionary histories of early - type galaxies in different environments .",
    "analysis of the early - types in poor groups and the field will also be important in relating the star - formation histories in intermediate environments to those in clusters and the field .",
