    "pabc is a co - polymer prepared from reacting n , ndiphenyl - n , nbis(3hydroxyphenyl)1 , 1;biphenyl(4,4 diamine ) ( dntbd ) , diethylene glycol bischloroformate , and triethylemine .",
    "the pabc molecular structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fgr : fig1](a ) .",
    "the pabc was produced by xerox corporation .",
    "pcbm powder was purchased from american dye source .",
    "the pcbm molecular structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fgr : fig1](b ) .",
    "each material was dissolved in monochlorobenzene and the solution was left overnight .",
    "eight different wt% of pabc were examined : 5 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , 40 , and 45 wt% . in this paper",
    ", all usage of wt% refers to the mass percentage of pabc as a fraction of the total mass of solids in the solution , with the remainder of the solid being pcbm .",
    "the combined 2 wt% solutions in the array of pabc : pcbm ratios were mixed in a bath sonicator for 20 minutes and heated to 60@xmath3c for 10 minutes .",
    "each solution was filtered using a 1.0@xmath4 m pore - size syringe filter .",
    "pedot : pss , an electrically conductive polymer blend with hole - transporting characteristics that consists of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene)polycation and a poly(styrenesulfonate)polyanion , was ordered from sigma aldrich ( 150 s / cm at 18 @xmath4 m film thickness ) .",
    "indium - tin - oxide ( ito ) coated aluminosilicate glass substrates were purchased from delta technologies ( 1  x 1  , @xmath5 85% transmittance , 120 - 160 nm coating thickness , 15 ohms / square ) .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     however , degeneracy implies that a linear combination over each set of frontier orbitals can also be understood as a real orbital .",
    "therefore , one can construct a frontier orbital delocalized over the donor polymer sites , which provides a mechanism for charge transport . nonetheless , even these resulting orbitals , localized over all donor sites , are more localized than those of the p3ht homo and lumo , as the later is fully delocalized over the entire conjugated backbone .",
    "the localization observed in pabc will result in less mobile excitations in this polymer when compared to the equivalent excitations in p3ht , and hence this effect could be seen as the hindering factor for excitation transfer between pabc molecules , limiting the charge transport and being the most likely cause for the low @xmath2 observed in experiment .",
    "the frontier orbital dft calculations were done following geometry optimization , using the b97d functional@xcite , with basis 6 - 311g**. all calculations were done using gaussian 09@xcite software package .",
    "efficiency could have an incremental improvement with better ito conductivity .",
    "a p - type oxide semiconductor such as nio could be used to coat the ito to increase efficiency by appropriately matching the energy levels@xcite .",
    "analogously , an n - type semiconductor such as lif can be used to coat the al electrode to increase efficiency@xcite .",
    "another opportunity is the optimization of device thickness that is known to increase efficiency both due to recombination and to optical interference issues@xcite .",
    "strict control of the aluminum evaporation process is also relevant for the overall efficiency of the sample .",
    "if aluminum evaporation occurs faster than a critical rate , the combination of heat capacity and heat dissipation of the sample glass is not enough to keep the sample below 200@xmath3c where thermal damage to the polymer starts to occur .",
    "all these factors are also related to the optimization of the morphology of the blend@xcite that is an art by itself and requires empirical design and trial and error .",
    "in summary , photovoltaic response was observed with a hole transporting polymer polyarylamine biscarbonate ester ( pabc ) blended with pcbm as the electron transporting material , in the bulk heterojunction configuration .",
    "efficiencies without further optimization were of the order of 0.5% .",
    "our results suggested that the low efficiencies are due to low pcbm mobility for the technique used .",

    "<S> photovoltaic ( pv ) devices made from blends of a polyarylamine biscarbonate ester ( pabc ) and [ 6,6]-phenyl @xmath0 butyric acid methyl ester ( pcbm ) have been fabricated and characterized . </S>",
    "<S> pabc is a hole transporting co - polymer prepared from reacting n , ndiphenyl - n , nbis(3-hydroxyphenyl)1,1;biphenyl(4,4diamine ) , diethylene glycol bischloroformate , and triethylemine . by varying the polymer loading in the blend , optimal power conversion efficiency ( pce ) of approximately 0.45% has been achieved for a blend consisting of 25 wt% pabc , which is an order of magnitude higher than the pce for a 45 wt% blend . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal ratio is at about 0.44:0.56 molar ratio of the active hole transporting to electron transporting moieties . </S>",
    "<S> results of mobility studies suggest that blends with higher pabc loading have efficiencies limited by hole transport . also responsible for the lower efficiency at higher pabc concentrations was optical filtering . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency does not appear to be limited by deep charge trapping . </S>",
    "<S> density functional theory calculations conducted pointed toward a strong localization of the frontier orbitals , which might offer an explanation for the low pabc hole mobility . calculated frontier orbital energy levels found band gap to be consistent with the @xmath1 measured .    in the race to obtain the best performing organic solar materials , hundreds of materials , blends and configurations have been intensively studied by various groups @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the most efficient single layer organic solar cells still have efficiencies typically below 12% in laboratory conditions and significantly lower efficiencies in pilot production @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there is a continued need for research in all aspects of polymer photovoltaics such as materials chemistry , materials characterization , device physics , process and production technology . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , root cause identification of photovoltaic efficiency limitation is very relevant for further development of solar cells technologies . </S>",
    "<S> the most well - known organic photovoltaics are polymer - fullerene bulk heterojunction ( bhj ) devices @xcite , where the polymer is the hole - transport material and the fullerene is the electron - transporting material . among bhj photovoltaic devices , the most well studied and most successful one , with efficiencies exceeding 5% , is the p3ht : pcbm blend , where the hole - transporting material is represented by poly(3-hexylthiophene ) ( p3ht ) and the electron - transporting material is represented by 1 - 3(-methoxycarbonyl)propyl-1-phenyl[6 - 6]@xmath0 ( pcbm ) . a first step </S>",
    "<S> when testing a combination of photovoltaic materials is to establish the optimum ratio of the materials for maximum power conversion efficiency . to achieve high power conversion efficiencies </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to maximize the mobility of the charge carriers and to equalize as much as possible the mobility of the electrons in the electron transport material with the mobility of holes in the hole - transport material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> power conversion efficiency is also highly dependent on the nano - morphology @xcite that depends on factors such as the solvent type , solvent evaporation rate , temperatures used during the fabrication process and deposition method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most organic solar active materials require post - coating thermal and/or vacuum treatments , as well as additional buffer or blocking layers in their structure to prevent leakage or to facilitate photovoltaic effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it would be desirable to develop new photovoltaic devices with materials that support longer storage life and can be fabricated in ambient environment . from the theoretical standpoint , density functional theory ( dft ) </S>",
    "<S> has been widely used to calculate , among other electronic properties of interest for photovoltaics , the frontier orbital energy levels@xcite and their spatial distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> despite there being some discussion with respect to the meaning of kohn - sham orbitals obtained from dft , they are thought to be adequate for qualitative studies ( see stowasser _ et al _ @xcite and references therein ) . in this study , </S>",
    "<S> polyarylamine biscarbonate ester ( pabc ) - a hole - transporting material - was blended with pcbm ( electron transporting material ) in various ratios to produce solution - processed solar cells . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated the effect of pabc : pcbm blend composition on the power conversion efficiency by examining the i - v curve under standard illumination . </S>",
    "<S> we have also studied carrier mobility of the materials and blends using the photoconductive time - of - flight ( tof ) technique @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> pabc was originally produced for use as a stand - alone hole transporting polymeric material for photoconductors or photoreceptors in xerographic applications@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the molar ratio of the hole transporting moiety - arylamine - to that of carbonate ester moiety is about 62:38 . </S>",
    "<S> one of the potential advantages of use of pabc is its long shelf life of over ten years , in contrast with shelf life of polythiophenes , such as p3ht , whose typical storage life is less than 18 months . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to most photovoltaic materials that are highly oxygen sensitive , pabc layers can be in principle fabricated in ambient environments . </S>",
    "<S> no electron - blocking layer was necessary to reach photovoltaic activity ; however to increase pec by a factor of approximately 3 we have used pedot : pss as an electron - blocking layer in most of the results reported in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the device studied is glass / ito/ /pedot : pss / pabc : pcbm / al . </S>",
    "<S> dtf calculations were used to study energy levels , and to explain open circuit voltage @xmath1 and short circuit current @xmath2 for the pabc : pcbm blend . </S>",
    "<S> calculations were checked against analogous calculations using the p3ht : pcbm blend . </S>"
