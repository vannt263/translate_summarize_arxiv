    "optical scattering , induced by structural disorder , can increase the dwell time of light inside an absorbing material , thus enhancing the chance of absorption  @xcite .",
    "compared to other light - trapping schemes that have been developed for solar cells , the non - resonant nature of this scheme enables broadband enhancement for light with a wide angle of incidence @xcite .",
    "however , the degree of absorption does not depend solely on the absorption coefficient and scattering properties of the medium , but also on the coherence and spatial characteristics of the input light .",
    "one recent example confirming this is the demonstration of coherent perfect absorption , which is the time - reversed analog of laser emission  @xcite .",
    "similar to lasing , this effect is narrow - band and requires tuning of both the frequency of the input light and absorptivity of the material to achieve 100% absorption  @xcite .",
    "a related but distinct approach , termed coherently enhanced absorption , takes advantage of the large number of degrees of freedom available for multiple scattering in a lossy environment to control the absorption  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown theoretically an appropriate coherent superposition of input fields can significantly enhance the coupling of light into a scattering medium , increasing the absorption at any frequency over a broad range .",
    "recent advances in wavefront shaping ( wfs ) techniques using spatial light modulators ( slms ) have enabled the generation of arbitrary wavefronts at the input of an optical system .",
    "this technique is driving forward the development of optical imaging techniques through scattering media such as biological tissue and fog  @xcite , and also enables the control of light intensity  @xcite , polarization state  @xcite , spectrum  @xcite , or temporal profile  @xcite at the scale of wavelength ( single or a few speckles ) .",
    "while the wavelength - scale control is desired for imaging with high resolution @xcite , the ability to manipulate light distributions on a much larger scale in a disordered system is needed for many applications .",
    "one example is photoelectrochemical cells , which often utilize light scattering to increase photon dwell time to enhance absorption .",
    "as the photoelectrons are generated in a volume that contains hundreds of thousands of speckles , increasing the intensity of a single speckle even by a few thousand times makes little difference to the total photocurrent .",
    "hence , global control of the light distribution is necessary , but this is known to be a much more challenging optimization problem than local control .",
    "good progress has been made recently to enhance the total transmission through a lossless opaque medium via wfs of an incident laser beam  @xcite .",
    "however , coherent control of light distribution and absorption over a macroscale region in highly scattering media has never been demonstrated .",
    "here we use wfs to both enhance and suppress the photocurrent in a dye - sensitized solar cell ( dssc ) , with a photoanode comprised of a highly scattering layer of dye - sensitized tio@xmath0 nanoparticles .",
    "since the collection efficiency of charge carriers is highly dependent on where light is absorbed  @xcite , it is advantageous to trap light inside the scattering layer as close as possible to the interface with the electrode , where charges can be efficiently separated , thus minimizing charge recombination  @xcite .",
    "however , strong light leakage through the interface makes it extremely difficult to confine light to a region close to the open boundary and enhance the absorption there .",
    "but here we show a significant enhancement of photocurrent by optimizing the wavefront of an incident laser beam , and illustrate the underlying mechanism via numerical modeling .",
    "in addition , we show that wfs can also _ suppress _ absorption by increasing the amount of light reflected .",
    "this work demonstrates the great potential of wfs toward depositing energy into targeted regions inside turbid media , which will enable the spatially resolved characterization of light absorption and charge transport inside regenerative and artificial photosynthetic systems .",
    "nm is split to two orthogonal polarizations and projected onto the slm .",
    "the phase front of both polarizations are modulated and then recombined at a beam splitter .",
    "the shaped wavefront is imaged onto the surface of the porous electrode in the dssc using a microscope objective .",
    "the illuminated area is a disk of diameter @xmath1 @xmath2 m .",
    "the short - circuit current of the solar cell is measured using a potentiostat . ]",
    "a dssc comprises a porous layer of sintered tio@xmath0 nanoparticles covered by a molecular dye , in this case the ruthenium - based n719 dye  @xcite , deposited on a conductive glass substrate .",
    "it functions as the light - absorbing working electrode of the solar cell , while a platinum - loaded conductive glass slide acts as the counter electrode .",
    "an electrolyte fills the gap between the two electrodes and shuttles charges between them .",
    "the working electrode of a dssc constructed in this manner can be considered as a scattering sample with homogeneous absorption  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ setup]a presents a schematic of the solar cells created in this study .",
    "light is incident onto the porous tio@xmath0 layer through the glass substrate coated with transparent conducting oxide .",
    "after light absorption , the excited dye molecules rapidly inject electrons into the tio@xmath0 .",
    "these electrons diffuse through the sintered particle network to be collected at the front side electrode , while the dye is regenerated via reduction by a redox mediator in the electrolyte , in this case the iodide / triiodide redox couple .",
    "the photo - induced current from a dssc is typically measured without applying a bias voltage , and is known as the short - circuit current @xmath3 .",
    "not all photo - generated electrons can diffuse through the tio@xmath0 layer and reach the electrode , because electrons may recombine or get trapped on the way  @xcite .",
    "the farther the electrons are generated from the electrode , the lower their probability of reaching it and contributing to the current .",
    "hence , @xmath3 depends not only on the amount of light being absorbed but also on the position where the light is absorbed inside the tio@xmath0 layer  @xcite .    in the wfs experiment ,",
    "the solar cell is excited by a narrow band laser beam at wavelength @xmath4 = 532 nm .",
    "the input wavefront is modulated using the experimental setup schematically shown in fig .",

    "the two linear polarizations are modulated independently  @xcite ( see methods ) and recombined into a single beam , which is projected onto the scattering medium in the solar cell using a microscope objective ( na = 0.95 ) .",
    "we measure @xmath3 generated by the dssc for each input phase mask and use a genetic algorithm to find the wavefronts that maximize or minimize @xmath3 .",
    "the genetic algorithm is known to be robust against noise in wfs experiments  @xcite .",
    "a cost function @xmath5 , which estimates the variation of the conversion efficiency of the solar cell , is defined as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the average short - circuit current and input optical power , respectively , measured for a set of random phase masks .",

    "the asterisk indicates the maximal power , which is enhanced 4.7 times or reduced 5.7 times . ]",
    "we constructed the dssc using standard procedures ( see methods and _ si _ ) .",
    "the transport mean free path of light in the @xmath14 @xmath2 m thick tio@xmath0 layer , @xmath15 , is measured in a coherent backscattering experiment to be 3.2 @xmath2 m @xcite . to shorten the response time of the solar cell in order to perform wfs experiments on reasonable time scales , we use a concentrated non - volatile iodine - based electrolyte that also absorbs light at 532 nm .",
    "the absorption of light by the electrolyte is proportional to that by the dye at any location , as both scale linearly with local field intensity .",
    "thus the short - circuit current @xmath3 , which results from light absorption by the dye , also reflects the absorption of the electrolyte , which does not contribute directly to the current .",
    "the ballistic absorption length @xmath16 is about 65 @xmath2 m , and the diffusive absorption length ( the typical distance light will travel via multiple scattering prior to being absorbed ) , @xmath17 , is 8.4 @xmath2 m  @xcite . without absorption ,",
    "the total transmission @xmath18 of the tio@xmath0 layer is estimated to be @xmath19 , and the reflection @xmath20 . in the presence of absorption , @xmath18 is reduced to @xmath21 , and @xmath22 to @xmath23 , with the remaining @xmath24 being absorbed ( in the absence of wavefront optimization ) .",
    "these estimations agree well with the experimental measurement ( _ si _ ) . by optimizing the incident wavefront ,",
    "the absorption cost function @xmath5 is gradually increased or decreased as shown in fig .",
    "[ results1]a . with the optimal wavefronts ,",
    "the photocurrent is enhanced by a factor of @xmath25 or suppressed by a factor of @xmath26 .",
    "we are thus able to coherently vary the energy conversion efficiency by a ratio of @xmath27 . to quantify the variation of the output power due to the modification of the input optical pattern , we measure the current - voltage ( @xmath28 ) curves for the two optimized wavefronts corresponding to maximum and minimum @xmath5 , as well as for a random illumination pattern .",
    "figure  [ results1]b displays the light - induced electrical output power , given by @xmath29 , as a function of bias voltage for each scenario .",
    "the maximum output power is enhanced 4.7 times or reduced 5.7 times , leading to total variation by a factor of 27 .    since approximately @xmath24 of the light",
    "is absorbed in the solar cell for a random illumination , the highest possible enhancement of the absorption would be a factor of 2.2 .",
    "if @xmath3 were proportional to the total amount of light being absorbed  @xcite , the experimental enhancement of 2.1 of the short circuit current would correspond to an almost perfect absorption of light in the absorbing medium .",
    "however , achieving the maximum absorption requires complete control over the amplitude and phase of the light in all input channels  @xcite .",
    "experimentally we control only a limited fraction of the input channels due to the finite numerical aperture of the objective lens and the fact that the probe beam is incident only on one side of the scattering sample .",
    "moreover , our slm setup only modulates the phase and not the amplitude of the incident light , as would be necessary to achieve the global optimum . consequently",
    ", the enhancement of total absorption that could be achieved with wfs is significantly reduced  @xcite .",
    "to investigate the cause for such a high enhancement factor measured experimentally , we perform numerical modeling . without loss of generality , we simulate the scattering medium confined in a 2d waveguide with reflecting sidewalls to reduce the computation load ; the system dimensions , as well as the amount of scattering and uniform absorption , are chosen to be near to the experimental values ( see methods ) .",
    "light with transverse - magnetic polarization ( @xmath30 field perpendicular to the waveguide plane ) is injected from one end of the waveguide , and its propagation in the random system is calculated with the recursive green s function method  @xcite . the transmission and reflection of light for the systems with and without absorption , averaged over random input wavefronts , match the measured values of real samples . to model the effect of wfs in our experiment",
    ", we use the empty waveguide modes as the basis to shape the input field . during the optimization process",
    ", we modulate the phase of each empty waveguide modes while keeping their amplitude constant .",

    "we used both a genetic algorithm and a sequential algorithm @xcite to maximize or minimize @xmath34 , and found similar results , although the sequential algorithm converges faster than the genetic algorithm due to the absence of noise in simulation .    , defined in eq.(2 ) , increases and then saturates when the input wavefront is optimized for @xmath32 $ ] ( red solid line ) and @xmath39 ( blue dashed line ) using a sequential algorithm .",

    "figure  [ rgfsim]a shows the enhancement of the cost function @xmath34 in the random medium with a uniform absorption coefficient . for comparison we also simulate the case of @xmath39 , which corresponds to a uniform cost function similar to the standard coherent enhancement of global absorption  @xcite .",
    "both the non - uniform ( @xmath32 $ ] ) and uniform cost functions increase continuously in the optimization process and eventually saturate ; however as expected , the final enhancement factor for @xmath32 $ ] significantly exceeds that for @xmath39 . figure [ rgfsim]b represents the integrated intensity @xmath40 inside the random medium . with random wavefront illumination , @xmath41 decays exponentially in the disordered system , as expected for light diffusion in the presence of absorption @xcite .",
    "when the input wavefront is optimized for uniform cost function ( @xmath39 ) , @xmath41 is peaked in the interior of the random system .",
    "the buildup of energy deep inside the scattering medium enhances the total absorption from @xmath24 to @xmath42 .",
    "meanwhile , the reflection decreases from @xmath23 to @xmath43 , and the transmission slightly increases from @xmath21 to @xmath43 .",
    "this result confirms that the global absorption is enhanced by wfs through causing the light to penetrate deeper into the lossy disordered medium .",
    "in contrast , the optimization for the non - uniform cost function ( @xmath32 $ ] ) leads to a significant increase of light intensity close to the front surface of the random medium [ fig .",
    "[ rgfsim]b ] , since only this region contributes significantly to the cost function @xmath34 .",
    "naively , the proximity to the open boundary would be expected to facilitate light escape from the absorbing medium , thus reducing the absorption and increasing the reflection . instead , for the optimal wavefront , the total absorption is increased from @xmath24 to @xmath44 , and the reflection decreased from @xmath23 to @xmath45 .",
    "this result suggests some partial trapping of the light near the surface , leading to a buildup of its intensity in the vicinity of the open boundary where the front side electrode is located .",
    "hence , the numerical simulation illustrates that our experimental procedure , which does feedback optimization based on the short - circuit current , does not simply optimize total absorption , but optimizes absorption locally , near the working electrode , so as to preferentially enhance the collected current .",
    "the measured current increase by a factor of 2.1 does not imply perfect absorption of all incident light and can be realized with the incomplete experimental control .",
    "to understand how the leakage rate of the light close to the open boundary is reduced , we investigate the contribution of different quasi - modes in the system to the reflected light .",
    "it has been shown previously that light propagation in random media can be well explained in terms of the interference effects of quasi - modes @xcite .",
    "we take this approach by decomposing the electric field inside the random medium in terms of the quasi - modes of the system : @xmath46 where @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) is the @xmath49-th mode with purely outgoing ( incoming ) wave boundary condition , and @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "the reflected field at the front surface ( @xmath51 ) of the disordered medium can be expressed as @xmath52 .",

    "the interference effect can be quantified by @xmath56 ( _ si _ ) .",

    "the modes interfere constructively , @xmath61 , to enhance reflection and reduce absorption . ]    to reduce the computing time for the full modal analysis , the length and width of the system in the simulation is reduced by a factor of two .",
    "the scattering and absorption parameters are adjusted so that the total transmission , reflection and absorption for random input wavefronts are essentially unchanged .",
    "we use the finite - difference frequency - domain ( fdfd ) method to calculate the quasi - modes whose frequencies are close to the frequency of the input light .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath55 for the different scenarios with @xmath32 $ ] are plotted in the complex plane in figs .",
    "[ modepic]a - c .",
    "the modes have uncorrelated phases for random wavefront illumination and their interference is averaged out ( and therefore @xmath62 is close to 1 ) .",
    "we see that the optimized wavefront for enhanced local absorption causes a destructive interference among the modes , making @xmath62 much smaller than 1 , and more importantly , that reflection is minimized and absorption is maximized at the front surface . despite the complexity of the medium , wfs exploits intereferences to efficiently concentrate light in the targeted region of the system .",
    "similarly , we show that wfs can also reduce the energy in a chosen region by minimizing the cost function @xmath34 [ figs .",
    "[ rgfsim]c and d ] . for @xmath39 , the reflection",
    "is greatly enhanced , decreasing the light intensity deep inside the system and thus the total amount of absorption . for @xmath32 $ ]",
    ", the minimization of the cost function is less efficient as it requires us to _ simultaneously _ increase the reflection and decrease the absorption close to the front surface . by decomposing the fields into the quasi - modes of the system , we confirm that the increase in reflection is caused by the constructive interference of excited modes [ fig . [ modepic]c ] , which facilitates light escape and suppresses absorption .",
    "in summary , we have experimentally demonstrated coherent control of light distribution and absorption over a length scale much larger than the wavelength of light inside an opaque mesoporous photoelectrochemical system that utilizes multiple scattering to improve light confinement .",
    "our proof - of - concept experiment shows that it is possible to vary the photocurrent in a dye - sensitized solar cell ( dssc ) by tailoring the input wavefront of a laser beam . to maximize the dssc s short - circuit current",
    ", the optimal wavefront concentrates the input light to the front side of the porous photoanode , where photo - generated electrons are most efficiently collected . despite the proximity to an open boundary",
    ", we find that destructive interference among the excited modes minimizes light leakage and enhances absorption .",
    "although in the current wfs experiment a narrow - band laser is used for coherent control of absorption , a recent theoretical study suggests that this approach is applicable to a relatively broadband light  @xcite .",
    "more generally , our method , assisted by a guidestar @xcite , will allow for spatially - resolved characterization of photo - induced processes inside opaque media , such as photoelectrochemical cells .",
    "this approach opens the possibility of investigating photoelectrochemical processes in targeted regions inside dense scattering media , such as that used in regenerative and artificial photosynthetic solar cells .",
