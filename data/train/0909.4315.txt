    "in this article , we will prove a result which gives the maximum number of edges in a plane graph on @xmath3 vertices , where each vertex bounds some @xmath4-gon for @xmath6 .",
    "we will find the exact upper bound using integer programming and the matching lower bound by construction .",
    "this problem arose from an investigation of extremal coin graphs with multiple radii that satisfy certain conditions we will discuss in section  [ sec : non - flowerable ] . here",
    "a _ coin graph _ is a graph whose vertices can be represented as closed , non - overlapping disks in the euclidean plane such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding disks intersect at their boundaries , i.e.  they touch .",
    "coin graphs are ubiquitous in the discrete geometry literature especially since the most general ones ( with no restrictions on the radii of the coins ) are , by a well - known theorem of thurston  @xcite , precisely the planar graphs .",
    "one of the best known extremal problems of coin graphs is perhaps one posed by erds  @xcite in 1946 and again by reutter  @xcite in 1972 : for a given natural number @xmath3 , determine the maximum number of edges a coin graph can have if all the coins have the same radius ( called _ unit coin graphs_. ) this problem has an unusually nice solution , due to harborth  @xcite from 1974 , who showed that the maximum number of edges is given by @xmath7",
    ". this problem can be generalized in many ways , as suggested in a recent excellent survey of open research problems in discrete geometry  @xcite .",
    "for instance it can be generalized to ( i ) graphs embedded in other surfaces such as the sphere or to graphs embedded in @xmath3-dimensional euclidean space for @xmath8 , where the definition of a coin graph is modified appropriately to an @xmath3-dimensional sphere graph , or ( ii ) by adding the constraint that no three vertices of the graph can be collinear forces the maximum degree of any vertex to be 5 , leading to a different upper bound , or ( iii ) by defining a similar class of graphs by connecting two vertices if and only if their distance @xmath9 satisfies @xmath10 for some given small @xmath11 .",
    "this structure can be pictured as a unit coin graph using elastic disks that can stretch some small amount .",
    "it is conjectured that for small @xmath12 ( less than 0.15 times the defined unit distance ) the maximum number of edges is still @xmath13 as in the case of the unit coin graph  @xcite . finally , ( iv ) swanepoel  @xcite recently conjectured that the largest number of edges in a coin graph with no triangular faces is given by @xmath14 .",
    "all these slight modifications are still open problems",
    ". another natural generalization of the unit coin graph problem above , that is not discussed in  @xcite , is to allow coins of more than one possible radius .",
    "brightwell and scheinerman  @xcite explored integral representations of coin graphs , where the radii of the coins can take arbitrary positive integer values .",
    "the results of this article were inspired by an extremal problem in the same vein as mentioned above , namely to determine the exact maximum number of edges in a coin graph on @xmath3 coins where their radii is such that no wheel graph can by formed by them . here",
    "a _ wheel graph _ is formed from a simple cycle by connecting one additional central vertex to each of the vertices of the cycle .",
    "a physical interpretation of this is to have a collection of @xmath3 coins on the table and their sizes are such that it is impossible to completely `` surround '' one coin with other coins such that they all touch .",
    "this means that the underlying plane graph of the coin graph has no vertex that only borders triangular faces .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : tight ] , we first introduce our notation and terminology .",
    "then for given @xmath3 and @xmath15 we compute the tight upper bound of the maximum number of edges a simple plane graph on @xmath3 vertices can have , if every vertex borders some @xmath4-gon where @xmath5 .",
    "the lower bound is obtained by direct construction , whereas the matching upper bound is obtained with integer programming ( ip ) . unlike many ip problems , the one we obtain is simple enough to be able to solve completely . in section  [ sec : non - flowerable ] we give an upper bound for the maximum number of edges a coin graph on @xmath3 vertices with no induced wheel graphs , and conjecture that this bound is indeed tight .",

    "the set of real numbers is @xmath18 and the euclidean plane @xmath19 , the cartesian product of two copies of @xmath18 . the complex number field is @xmath20 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , all graphs in this article will be finite , simple and undirected .",
    "the cycle graph on @xmath3 vertices and @xmath3 edges will be denoted by @xmath21 and the wheel graph on @xmath22 vertices will be denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "our main objective in this section is to prove the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : kgon ] let @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "the maximum number @xmath2 of edges of a plane graph on @xmath3 vertices , where each vertex bounds some @xmath4-gon for @xmath5 , is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27    we will show that @xmath28 is both an upper bound and a lower bound for @xmath2 .",
    "we start with the easier case and show that @xmath28 is lower bound using an explicit construction , and we consider each of the three cases , @xmath29 where @xmath30 , separately , since each case has a unique construction .",
    "we then conclude the section with the more involved case and prove that the matching lower bound @xmath28 is also an upper bound .",
    "[ [ the - lower - bound ] ] the lower bound + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    write @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "form @xmath33 disjoint copies of @xmath34 and one copy of @xmath35 in the plane , no cycle containing another cycle , consisting of @xmath3 edges altogether .",
    "we need @xmath36 edges to connect the cycles into one connected component such that ( i ) the infinite face is bounded by a simple @xmath3-cycle and ( ii ) the internal faces of this @xmath3-cycle other than the @xmath34s and the @xmath35 are triangular .",
    "then we add @xmath37 edges to fully triangulate the infinite face .",
    "the total number of edges thus obtained is @xmath38 .",
    "consider now the various cases for @xmath39 .",
    "first case : @xmath40 . in this case",
    "@xmath41 and two additional edges can be added to the interior of the cycle @xmath42 to create 3 regions , 2 bounded by @xmath15-gons and one by a triangle such that every vertex is bounded by a @xmath15-gon .",
    "add these additional edges between appropriate vertices of the cycle @xmath42 .",
    "the total number of edges is then given by @xmath43    second case : @xmath44 .",
    "here @xmath45 and one additional edge can be added to the interior of the cycle @xmath46 to create 2 regions bounded by @xmath15-gons . add this additional edge between appropriate vertices of the cycle @xmath46 .",
    "the total number of edges is now given by @xmath47 since for any real numbers @xmath48 with @xmath49 a positive integer we have @xmath50 , then this last expression equals @xmath51 .",
    "third case : @xmath52 . here",
    "the total number of edges is given by @xmath53 the last step just as in the previous case when @xmath44 .",
    "these three cases show that the mentioned bound @xmath28 can always be reached .",
    "[ [ the - upper - bound ] ] the upper bound + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we will derive the matching upper bound using integer programming . unlike most integer programs , it turns out that our specific one in this case will be simple enough to be able to spot a general pattern to solve it exactly .",
    "assume we have a plane graph @xmath54 on @xmath3 vertices with the property mentioned in the theorem .",
    "the number of edges is @xmath55 and the number of faces is @xmath56 .",
    "form a new graph @xmath57 by adding a vertex inside each @xmath4-gon , where @xmath5 and connect that vertex to all the vertices bounding the @xmath4-gon .",
    "let @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 be the number of vertices , edges , and faces of @xmath57 .",
    "note that @xmath57 is planar and fully triangulated .",
    "for @xmath61 , let @xmath62 denote the number of @xmath63-sided faces of @xmath54 and @xmath64 be the number of all @xmath4-sided faces where @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath65 . by assumption",
    "we have @xmath66 and @xmath67 , by euler s formula .",
    "let @xmath9 be the sum of the degrees of all the vertices that were added above , so @xmath9 also equals the number of edges added to @xmath54 to obtain @xmath57 .",
    "hence @xmath68 , so @xmath69 .",
    "note that @xmath70 where for each @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the sum of the degrees of the vertices of degree @xmath63 added to @xmath54 and @xmath73 is the sum of degrees of vertices of degree greater than or equal to @xmath15 added to @xmath54 .",
    "therefore we have @xmath74 for each @xmath71 and so @xmath75 and hence @xmath76 note that @xmath55 is maximized if @xmath77 is minimized .",
    "since the conditions are ( 1 ) @xmath78 , ( 2 ) @xmath79 for @xmath80 , and ( 3 ) @xmath81 , we can simplify this optimization problem by setting @xmath82 for @xmath83 and the problem reduces to minimizing the value of @xmath84 over nonnegative integers , given the constraints @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "[ lmm : key ] if @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath87 , then @xmath88    drawing the vector @xmath89 and the lines @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the euclidean plane @xmath19 , we can spot the solution to our integer program @xmath92 , since the function @xmath93 , a dot product of two vectors , will obtain its minimum value at @xmath90 and @xmath94 in the case of @xmath95 where @xmath96 , and at @xmath97 and @xmath98 otherwise .",
    "the figures  [ fig : n8k6 ] and  [ fig : n7k4 ] illuminate this general pattern , which here remains the same for all other values of @xmath3 and @xmath15 . using the above definition of @xmath99 in the lemma , we can write @xmath100 as the @xmath101-value that will always minimize the function",

    "a coin graph representation of the wheel graph is called a _ flower_. a coin graph with no flowers is _ non - flowered _ and a collection @xmath129 of coins is _ non - flowerable _ if no flower can be formed by coins from @xmath129 .",
    "this terminology is consistent with that found in  @xcite .",
    "note that it is not necessary for a non - flowerable collection to contain coins of distinct radii , but it can not contain seven or more coins of equal radii , since seven coins with the same radius can form a regular hexagonal flower .",

    "theorem  @xcite we can obtain a coin graph representation of each of the planar graphs constructed for the lower bound of theorem  [ thm : kgon ] in section  [ sec : tight ] . by construction it is guaranteed that it will be non - flowered . however , we do not know if the the underlying _ collection _ of coins used in this representation is non - flowerable , since some flower could be formed by a subset of them .",
    "we do suspect that each such coin graph representation of the graphs formed for the lower bound in theorem  [ thm : kgon ] can be represented by a non - flowerable collection of coins : recall that the map @xmath137 given by @xmath138 is an _ inversion _ about the unit circle centered at origin .",
    "it is known fact in plane geometry that every inversion of the complex plane maps a coin graph to another coin graph with the same underlying planar graph .",
