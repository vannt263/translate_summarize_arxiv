    "solid state , particle , and mathematical physics represent three fundamental branches of modern physics . in the last decades , merging ideas coming from these branches has led to a new paradigm , the era of topological condensed matter physics .",
    "the notion of band structure , typical of solid state physics , together with topological concepts , connected to the field of mathematical physics , allows to provide a topological classification of materials .",
    "the result is the emergence of topologically non - trivial electronic systems described by dirac - like equations , which are naturally found in particle and nuclear physics  @xcite . even though it is known that a material can be classified , according to its band structure , as an insulator or a metal , with large or low resistance respectively , in 2007 a material which does not fit in this classification was discovered : the first topological insulator  @xcite .    to be more precise ,",
    "the advent of topological condensed matter physics can be dated back to 1980 , when von klitzing _",
    "et al . _ discovered experimentally  @xcite that when a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas at the interface of a semiconductor heterojunction is subjected to a strong magnetic field , the longitudinal conductance vanishes whereas the hall conductance is quantized to the values @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an integer number .",
    "this integer quantum hall ( qh ) effect was explained  @xcite within a single - particle picture in terms of landau levels , and it was realized that these systems host metallic edge states coexisting with insulating bulk states .",
    "semiclassically , this effect can be understood by imagining the electrons in the bulk of the 2d plane to be localised due to their cyclotron motion , while the electrons near the edges perform skipping orbits , thus creating chiral one - dimensional ( 1d ) conducting channels  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the measured quantised conductance is almost completely insensitive to the presence of impurities and disorder .",
    "the explanation relies on the topological nature of the qh states , which form a quantum phase which can not be described according to the usual ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "this classification , which is based on local order parameters , fails to characterise qh states . instead",
    ", topological quantum numbers must be introduced which reflect the global properties of the system .",
    "the most striking manifestation of non - trivial topology is the emergence of edge states : in qh systems with hall conductance @xmath0 , @xmath1 channels are located at the sample boundaries .",
    "the insensitivity of the qh conductance to fabrication dependent details is a consequence of the topological properties of the band structure .",
    "since the latter are not affected by weak local perturbations such as disorder and impurities , the metallic edge states are robust . the qh effect at filling factor @xmath1 is classified as @xmath2 topological order , i.e.",
    ", the phase is characterized by an integer number @xmath1 , which determines the quantised conductance @xmath3 and the presence of @xmath1 edge channels .",
    "soon after the discovery of the qh effect , physicists started to wonder if time - reversal symmetry ( trs ) breaking , which in qh systems is brought about by the magnetic field , is necessary to generate a topologically non - trivial state .",
    "related to this question , haldane proposed a lattice system of spinless electrons in a periodic magnetic flux to realise the qh effect  @xcite . although the total magnetic flux through the system is zero , electrons form a conducting edge channel . as no net magnetic field",
    "is present , the quantised hall conductance in this case must originate from the band structure of electrons rather than from the discrete landau levels in a magnetic field .",
    "several years later , a breakthrough was made by kane and mele  @xcite who generalised the haldane model to a graphene sheet with spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , providing the theoretical basis for 2d topological insulators ( tis ) .",
    "soc respects trs and it acts as two effective and opposite magnetic fields for spin - up and spin - down electrons . as in haldane s proposal , metallic edge states appear in the bulk energy gap .",
    "however , due to trs , they now come in kramers pairs , with electrons with opposite spin propagating in opposite directions . crucially , due to kramers theorem ,",
    "these edge states are protected from backscattering ( bs ) as long as trs is preserved , thus giving rise to a symmetry - protected topological phase .",
    "these edge stares are called _ helical _ , because the electron spin is locked to the propagation direction in such a way that they are eigenstates of the helicity operators , i.e. , the projection of the spin onto the momentum .",
    "the edge states give rise to the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect : a longitudinal charge current produces a transverse spin bias , resulting in a quantised spin hall conductance @xmath4 .",
    "although it was soon realised that because of the tiny bulk gap , the qsh effect can not be experimentally observed in graphene , the ideas emerging from these studies pushed theorists to search for the qsh effect in materials with strong intrinsic soc .",
    "a breakthrough was made in 2006 by bernevig , hughes , and zhang  @xcite with the prediction that a cdte / hgte / cdte quantum well ( qw ) behaves , under certain conditions , as a 2d ti .",
    "the different band structures of hgte and cdte are responsible for a topological phase transition when the thickness of the hgte layer of the qw is increased .",
    "cdte has a normal semiconductor band structure , while hgte has an inverted semimetallic one due to intrinsic soc , with the @xmath5 band , usually originating from the valence band , above the @xmath6 band .",
    "if the hgte layer is thicker than a critical thickness @xmath7 nm , the qw displays an inverted band structure .",
    "due to the closing and reopening of the gap between the @xmath6-like and @xmath5-like bands in passing from the normal to the inverted regime , a topological phase transition occurs , and helical edge states appear in the inverted regime .",
    "this theoretical prediction was confirmed in 2007  @xcite , when non - local transport properties which could be ascribed to the helical edge states were observed .",
    "kane and mele had already showed  @xcite that , contrary to the qh effect , the qsh effect is classified by a @xmath8 topological order .",
    "if an even number of kramers doublets appear on the edge , the edge state spectrum can be gapped out by various perturbations without breaking trs , making such systems topologically equivalent to ordinary insulators . on the other hand , in the presence of an odd number of kramers doublets a single metallic edge states is always present ( as long as trs is preserved ) , making such systems topologically nontrivial .",
    "therefore , the qsh conductance of a topological ( trivial ) insulator is @xmath4 ( @xmath9 ) , and its associated topological index is @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "physically , the @xmath8 invariant @xmath12 simply counts the number of gapless and protected helical edge states modulo @xmath13 , in analogy with the integer @xmath1 counting the number of edge channels in the qh .    in the meanwhile ,",
    "the qsh phase has been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed in other materials as well .",
    "a prominent example is an inas / gasb heterostructure .",
    "an interface of these materials forms a type - ii ( staggered ) junction , and the valence band of gasb can hybridize with the conduction band of inas . in this case gate",
    "voltages are able to tune the system between the normal and inverted regime , allowing to investigate the topological phase transition with a great flexibility .",
    "more closely related to the original graphene - like models proposed by kane and mele , it was found that a larger bulk gap could be achieved in silicene  @xcite , a lattice of silicon atoms  @xcite .",
    "silicene , as well as other lattice models like germanene , stanene  @xcite or transition - metal dichalcogenides  @xcite , are promising for generating the qsh effect in lattice models .",
    "we briefly mention the recent proposal of realizing topological insulators in arrays of tunnel coupled quantum wires , an interesting architecture which could give rise to several exotic states of matter  @xcite .",
    "the search for new 2d tis , as well as a deeper understanding of the behaviour of the discovered ones , is currently one of the major issues in condensed matter physics .",
    "three dimensional ( 3d ) tis , characterised by insulating bulk states and metallic surface states with helical spin textures , have been discovered as well .",
    "relevant examples are represented by bi@xmath14se@xmath15 , bi@xmath14te@xmath15 and sb@xmath14te@xmath15  @xcite . as in the case of 2d tis",
    ", the surface states are characterised by spin - momentum locking , with spin and momentum orthogonal one to each other .",
    "angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and spin - resolved arpes detected the presence of surface states characterised by a dirac cones with the predicted helical spin texture  @xcite .    by combining tis with superconducting materials ,",
    "a new building block for futuristic applications can be engeneered : the topological superconductor  @xcite . here",
    "peculiar bound states appear , whose properties can be described in terms of majorana fermions  @xcite .",
    "these states have exotic properties , the most stunning being non - abelian statistics , that in principle would allow to implement revolutionary protocols for fault - tolerant quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "although the first theoretical models  @xcite and experimental realisations  @xcite do not exploit tis , topological superconductors were theoretically proposed  @xcite and experimentally realised  @xcite in ti based platforms as well .",
    "although the final goal of these efforts is to implement topological superconductors , they also represent a valuable playground to shed light on the helical edge states and their physics .",
    "the search for new topological materials does not end here .",
    "for example , by driving ordinary insulators out of equilibrium by means of time - dependent perturbations a topological state can be achieved , called floquet topological insulator  @xcite .",
    "it was predicted that by irradiating an otherwise topologically - trivial hgte / cdte heterostructure with electromagnetic radiation , a topological phase transition can be achieved  @xcite , with the subsequent emergence of protected edge states  @xcite .",
    "therefore , floquet theory allows to extend the concept of a ti to out - of - equilibrium regimes  @xcite .    other topologically nontrivial materials , which currently receive a lot of attention , include weyl semimetals  @xcite , topological crystalline insulators  @xcite , flat band models  @xcite and fractional qh  @xcite and qsh states  @xcite .    in this review",
    "we will focus on 2d tis , with special emphasis on the properties of their helical edge states .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2dti ] we first provide a qualitative description of the edge state mechanism in systems described by dirac - like hamiltonians .",
    "we discuss the constraints necessary for the bulk insulator to acquire a topological phase with edge states .",

    "[ sec : exp ] we review several important experiments involving 2d tis , measuring non - local transport , imaging the helical edge states , and confirming their spin polarization .",
    "we briefly comment on new experiments which combine 2d tis with superconductors .",
    "although these experiments aim mainly at realizing topological superconductors , they provide valuable information about the physical properties of the helical edge states .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : scattering ] we discuss transport in edge states in more detail by considering the backscattering mechanisms occurring at the edge beyond the ballistic regime . a crucial role",
    "is played by electron - electron interactions , which have a particularly strong impact on the physics of 1d systems . here",
    "the concept of single fermionic quasiparticles fails , and the relevant excitations have collective bosonic character .",
    "the interacting helical edge states , described by the helical luttinger liquid model , are expected to show a variety of unexpected physical properties .",
    "the transport properties of the interacting helical edge states can be affected by peculiar backscattering mechanisms , which will be reviewed in this section .",
    "finally we discuss the recent experiment by li _",

    "[ sec : tunneling ] we discuss the tunneling properties in 2d tis .",
    "we introduce the quantum point contact geometry , showing that it can be useful both to investigate the fundamental physical properties of the helical edge states and to develop interesting devices in the context of electron quantum optics , such as electron interferometers .    finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : outlook ] briefly summarizes the main topics covered in this review .",
    "in order to provide a generic theoretical description of 2d tis without limiting the discussion to a specific solid - state realisation , we start with the so - called modified dirac hamiltonian  @xcite , which allows one to understand the main physical properties of 2d tis and the emergence of helical edge states realising the qsh effect .",
    "the dirac equation  @xcite is known to describe an elementary relativistic spin-@xmath16 particle @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the speed of light , @xmath19 is the rest mass of the particle , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are related to dirac matrices satisfying the clifford algebra . the structure of the latter depends on the dimensionality @xmath22 of the system . before studying the case @xmath23 , which is necessary to make connections with the physics of 2d tis",
    ", it turns out to be useful to revisit the @xmath24 case . indeed ,",
    "many key concepts already emerge in this simpler case , and can then be easily generalised to higher dimensions .",
    "furthermore , we replace the speed of light @xmath18 with a general fermi velocity @xmath25 .",
    "we consider the 1d dirac hamiltonian density is set to @xmath26 throughout this review , and explicitly restored for clarity when needed . ]",
    "@xmath27 where we used @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "eigenstates with positive and negative energies are separated by the gap @xmath30 . in this case",
    ", the _ sign _ of the energy gap is unimportant : the dirac hamiltonian is invariant under the transformation @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and so is the gap @xmath34 .",
    "however , this aspect can be further investigated by looking at a system where the sign of the mass term changes .",
    "suppose that @xmath35 finite energy gaps exist for @xmath36 .",
    "however , if we assume the mass @xmath37 to interpolate continuously , the gap should vanish close to the domain wall at @xmath38 , and close and reopen around it . in a sense ,",
    "the system is gapped almost everywhere , except near the domain wall , where a peculiar state with energy inside the bulk energy gap could exist .",
    "indeed , one finds that intra - gap bound states can not exist if @xmath39 . on the other hand , if @xmath40 a zero - energy bound state solution arises @xmath41 thus lying inside the bulk energy gap .",
    "its probability distribution @xmath42 is localised around the domain wall and spreads over distances @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the dirac hamiltonian admits intra - gap bound states localised near domain walls . in this sense , if we regard the vacuum as a system with an infinitely large and positive energy gap , a system with a negative gap would have intra - gap bound states at its boundaries .    hence",
    ", opposite mass terms in dirac hamiltonians may explain the existence of edge states .",
    "however , due to the @xmath44 symmetry , one can not distinguish bare dirac hamiltonians with opposite @xmath45 by a topological quantum number .",
    "this ambiguity is not present in the so - called modified dirac hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath46 where the quadratic correction @xmath47 to the bare mass term has been added to break the symmetry @xmath44 .",
    "translating to momentum space , one obtains @xmath48 with the @xmath49-dependent mass term @xmath50 we are interested in studying whether eq . admits zero - energy bound states at its boundaries .",
    "thus , we consider the hamiltonian on a semi - infinite 1d system bounded at @xmath38 , and require the wave function @xmath51 to vanish at @xmath38 . after multiplying by @xmath52 from the left one",
    "can rewrite @xmath53 therefore , we can write @xmath54 , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 being an eigenstate of @xmath57 with eigenvalue @xmath58 .",
    "equation now reduces to an equation for @xmath59 @xmath60 using the ansatz @xmath61 , one obtains two solutions @xmath62 that must satisfy @xmath63 in order for @xmath51 to be normalisable .",
    "this requirement leads to the criterion @xmath64 which is the necessary condition for the existence of the bound state @xmath65 here , @xmath66 is related to the penetration depth of the edge state into the bulk .    ): for large @xmath67 the edge state is localised ( solid black ) ; by lowering @xmath68 it spreads into the bulk ( dashed blue ) , eventually disappearing for @xmath69 ( dotted red).,width=264 ]    the bound state is very sharply localised near the boundary for large @xmath68 , penetrates into the bulk by lowering @xmath68 , and eventually disappears when @xmath69 , as shown in fig .  [ obc ] .",
    "it is worth to note that the existence of the edge state only depends on the global quantity @xmath70 : if @xmath71 the edge state exists otherwise it does not , regardless of the specific values of the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath72 .      in two spatial dimensions the modified dirac hamiltonian in momentum space reads ( @xmath73 ) @xmath74 with @xmath75 , @xmath76 and the @xmath77-dependent mass term @xmath78 in order to study the emergence of edge states , we proceed similarly to the 1d case .",
    "we consider a semi - infinite plane ( @xmath79 ) , and require the solution to vanish at the boundary @xmath38 .",
    "the system is translational invariant in the @xmath80 direction so that @xmath81 is a good quantum number , but @xmath49 must be replaced by @xmath82 . using the 1d solution ,",
    "it is clear that a zero - energy bound state as in eq",
    ".   exists for @xmath83 if the constraint @xmath71 is satisfied .",
    "then , the solution for non - zero @xmath81 corresponds to a bound state along @xmath84 and a plane wave along @xmath85 @xmath86 where the penetration depths @xmath87 now also depend on @xmath81 . by projecting the hamiltonian onto the edge state solution ,",
    "its energy dispersion is found to depend linearly on momentum @xmath88 corresponding to electrons propagating with velocity @xmath89 importantly , because @xmath90 for @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) is an eigenstate of @xmath93 with eigenvalue @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) , the spin polarisation and the direction of propagation are both determined by @xmath96 . as the spin and the direction of propagation are thus connected , this property is called spin - momentum locking and represents one of the defining features of helical edge states . in particular , electrons with opposite spin counter - propagate .    before turning to discuss helical edge states in realistic 2d tis , we want to make the topological distinction between the cases @xmath97 more explicit .",
    "consider the @xmath77-dependent mass term defined in eq .  .",
    "at small momenta , the sign of @xmath98 is determined by @xmath99 , while at large momenta it is determined by @xmath100 .",
    "then if @xmath101 the sign of @xmath98 at small and large momenta is the same , while in the case @xmath71 it changes sign as sweeping through the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "the latter ( topologically nontrivial ) case resembles what we discussed previously , an edge states emerging in the presence mass term which changes sign .",
    "these behaviours do not depend on the specific values of @xmath45 and @xmath72 , but only on the quantity @xmath70 being either @xmath94 or @xmath95 . by considering the area on the bloch sphere swept by a ( normalized ) vector @xmath102",
    "when @xmath103 varies over the entire bz , a topological invariant can be defined : the chern number . to understand this concept ,",
    "we start from the berry phase @xmath104 . it is the phase acquired by the bloch wave function @xmath105 ( with band index @xmath1 ) when the momentum @xmath103 is varied around a closed loop in the bz .",
    "the berry phase can be expressed either as a line integral of the berry connection @xmath106 or using stokes theorem as the surface integral over the berry curvature @xmath107 . the chern number @xmath108 is defined as the berry curvature over the bz , summed over all the occupied bands @xmath109 and it can be shown to be an integer number .",
    "classes of systems characterized by different chern numbers can not be continuously deformed one into another without closing the energy gap , and therefore the gap is `` topologically protected '' against smooth perturbations . in terms of eq .",
    ", an analogy can be drawn between the topological classification introduced above and the one characterising different surfaces in terms of their genus @xmath110 .",
    "indeed , the genus is defined as a surface integral of a gaussian curvature , just like the chern number is defined as the surface integral of the berry curvature .",
    "then , the distinction between topologically trivial ( @xmath111 ) and non - trivial ( @xmath112 ) phases of matter is identical to the different topologies of the sphere with genus @xmath113 and the torus with genus @xmath114 .",

    "we explicitly focus on the first experimentally discovered 2d ti : the hgte / cdte qw . the ideas behind its discovery can be understood as follows .",
    "cdte has a normal semiconductor band structure , with the valence band @xmath5 , originating from @xmath118-type bands , separated by an energy gap from the conduction band @xmath6 , which originates from an @xmath119-type band . on the other hand , because of the strong soc , bulk hgte displays an inverted semimetallic band structure , with the @xmath5 bands above the @xmath6 valence band , as schematically shown in fig .",

    "starting from the bulk bands , one can consider different behaviours of thin and thick qws , whose band structures are determined by confinement , as schemetically shown in fig .",

    "we assume the qw to be built along the @xmath131 direction . in the presence of trs ,",
