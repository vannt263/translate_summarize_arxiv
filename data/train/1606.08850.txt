    "the stellar mass of a galaxy ( @xmath3 ) is correlated with the gas phase metallicity ( @xmath2 , the oxygen abundance relative to hydrogen ) such that galaxies with higher @xmath3 have larger oxygen abundance .",
    "this well - studied correlation is known as the mass - metallicity relation ( mzr ; e.g. , @xcite ) . however , the measurement of a galaxy s characteristic gas - phase metallicity is the subject of ongoing debate .",
    "different techniques for measuring metallicity disagree by up to @xmath4 and produce mzrs with different slopes and normalizations @xcite .",
    "the largest discrepancies are between metallicities measured using the direct method , which requires measurements of the weak auroral @xmath5}\\lambda 4363 $ ] line to measure the electron temperature of the gas , and theoretically calibrated strong line methods , which relate ratios of bright emission line fluxes to the gas phase metallicity determined from photoionization models .",
    "theoretical strong line methods systematically measure higher metallicities than the direct method , but each type of technique requires approximations that may bias measurements high or low , respectively ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since there is no way to determine which method best approximates the  true \" metallicity of a galaxy , it remains unclear which version of the mzr is the best representation of reality .",
    "recently , evidence has accumulated for a correlation between the mzr and other galaxy parameters .",
    "@xcite showed that at a fixed stellar mass , galaxies with higher specific star formation rates ( ssfr , the ratio of star formation rate ( sfr ) to stellar mass ) or larger half - light radii have lower metallicity . following this initial discovery",
    ", other authors similarly found that galaxies at fixed mass with higher sfr have lower metallicity ( @xcite , hereafter m10 ) .",
    "this correlation was dubbed the  fundamental metallicity relation \" by m10 , who suggested that this relation is invariant up to @xmath6 .",
    "these authors found that the scatter about the median mzr was substantially reduced when the correlation with sfr was accounted for .",
    "subsequent theoretical work has investigated mechanisms that may drive the observed anti - correlation between metallicity and sfr .",
    "several authors have proposed analytic models in which both metallicity and sfr are governed by the interplay between inflowing gas ( either pristine or previously enriched ) and feedback and outflows due to star formation @xcite ; such models naturally account for a relation between @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and sfr . given that a source of gas is required to sustain star formation",
    ", it is reasonable that higher sfr galaxies might have lower gas phase metallicities if the inflowing gas is metal poor compared to the ambient ism .",
    "semi - analytic models ( e.g. , @xcite ) and hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) have also qualitatively reproduced the observed relation .",
    "more recent observational studies have produced discrepant results regarding the shape of the @xmath7 relation .",
    "@xcite found that the sense of the correlation with sfr reverses at high stellar mass in their sample of observed galaxies and also found a similar effect in a cosmological semi - analytical model .",
    "however , @xcite argued that this apparent turnover is an artifact of signal - to - noise cuts imposed on their observational sample by using metallicities from @xcite , which require confident detections of weak forbidden lines .",
    "@xcite used stacked spectra of nearby galaxies to detect the auroral @xmath5}\\lambda 4363 $ ] line , enabling ",
    "average \" metallicity measurements for galaxies with similar masses and sfrs using the direct method .",
    "this technique can not be used to measure metallicities of individual galaxies in large galaxy samples because the @xmath5}\\lambda 4363 $ ] line becomes too weak to detect at high @xmath2 .",
    "they found an even stronger correlation of metallicity with sfr than any of the studies mentioned previously , all of which used strong line metallicities .",
    "the studies discussed above made use of fiber spectroscopy from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , which integrates over large areas for typical galaxies in the local universe .",
    "this inherent averaging over many @xmath8 regions can be avoided using integral field spectroscopy .",
    "fiber spectroscopy is also limited to the centers of galaxies , whereas both integral field and drift - scan spectroscopy collect larger fractions of the total light from galaxies , avoiding potential biases in metallicity and sfr measurements due to variations in the covering fraction with redshift .",
    "these methods have recently been used to measure the characteristic metallicities of galaxies and to study the correlation between the mzr and sfr @xcite    the results from these integral field studies are mixed .",
    "@xcite studied the correlation between the mzr and both sfr and @xmath9 mass and concluded that the mzr does not significantly depend on sfr .",
    "further , accounting for the correlation with sfr actually increased the scatter in their best fit relation , though this may be a result of their modest sample size ( @xmath10 galaxies ) .",
    "likewise , @xcite found no correlation between the mzr and sfr using data from the califa survey @xcite to measure metallicities of individual @xmath8 regions .",
    "however , a new analysis of the same data by @xcite did find evidence for a correlation with sfr in the califa data , though again only for a small sample ( 150 galaxies ) .",
    "the disagreement between different studies regarding the strength of the correlation between the mass - metallicity relation and sfr motivates careful analysis of systematic errors that enter into the measurements of these three quantities .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the effects of using different sfr indicators and metallicity measurements on the @xmath7 relation .",
    "they found that no changes in the method of measuring these quantities caused the sfr correlation to disappear , so this relation is unlikely to be spurious .",
    "however , it is still quite possible that correlations with sfr might be induced by the methods of measuring these quantities ; e.g. , the choice of metallicity calibration and method of accounting for the degeneracy between metallicity and ionization parameter could be biased in a way that correlates with sfr .    since systematic errors",
    "can certainly alter the observed strength of this relation , the true strength of the correlation between the mass - metallicity relation and sfr remains quite unconstrained .",
    "this limitation compromises any attempt to theoretically interpret the observed relation .",
    "since galaxy chemical evolution models have begun to use the @xmath7 relation as an input prescription or to constrain model parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is crucial to understand the range of possible strengths of this relation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study potential sources of systematic error that can affect the observed strength of the @xmath7 relation .",
    "we present the first analysis of this relation using metallicity estimators from @xcite ( hereafter d13 ) , which we compare to the methods of m10 and @xcite ( hereafter d16 ) .",
    "further , since the three parameters studied here are all derived quantities and could all suffer from significant systematic errors , we search for measurement biases that could alter the apparent strength of the correlation with sfr .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ data ] we review our sample selection and methods for measuring the quantities of interest ; in section  [ results ] we present our @xmath7 relation for sdss galaxies using metallicity calibrations from d13 and investigate sources of bias in this relation ; in section  [ discussion ] we discuss the implications of the strength of the correlation with sfr for theoretical analyses of galaxy evolution ; and finally in section  [ conclusions ] we summarize our findings and conclusions . throughout the paper we use  metallicity , \"  oxygen abundance , \" and @xmath2 interchangeably to mean the gas - phase oxygen abundance relative to hydrogen ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we assume a @xmath12 cosmology with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the data in this analysis are derived from galaxy spectra from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 ( sdss dr7 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we use measurements of stellar masses and emission line fluxes from the publicly available sdss dr7 mpa / jhu catalog@xcite .",
    "we select our main star - forming galaxy sample following the selection criteria of m10 .",
    "we require the galaxies to have redshifts between 0.07 and 0.30 .",
    "the median covering fractions are 22% and 49% of the flux at the lower and upper redshift bounds , respectively , as calculated from the @xmath16-band petrosian and fiber magnitudes . to avoid large or unphysical reddening corrections , we require the foreground milky way @xmath17 to be less than 2.5 and the balmer decrement ( the ratio of @xmath18 to @xmath19 emission line flux ) to be greater than 2.5 .",
    "we use the observed balmer decrement and the @xcite extinction law to correct all line fluxes for dust extinction , assuming @xmath20 of 3.1 and an intrinsic balmer decrement of 2.86 .",
    "we remove active galactic nuclei ( agn ) from the sample according to the empirical bpt diagram classification of @xcite , leaving us with an initial sample of 229,179 galaxies .",
    "we scale down total stellar masses from the mpa / jhu catalog from a @xcite to a @xcite initial mass function .",
    "we use the @xcite relation to calculate the sfr from the extinction - corrected @xmath18 luminosity inside the fiber , again , scaled down to a @xcite imf .",
    "these sfrs only sample the central regions of the galaxies falling within the @xmath21 fiber .",
    "we use fiber - based sfrs to avoid introducing uncertainty from aperture corrections , which require assumptions about the distribution of light and star formation within a galaxy .",
    "these sfrs will be biased low with respect to the true total sfrs of the galaxies .",
    "however , they will still provide reliable relative ranking of galaxy sfrs , even if they are biased low as an ensemble .",
    "they are thus sufficient for identifying trends with sfr , in that they can reliably be used to sort galaxies into bins of sfr .",
    "variations in covering fraction will produce some uncertainty that scatters galaxies into neighboring bins .",
    "however , in practice this uncertainty is less than is produced by applying aperture corrections , or by using sfrs derived from broadband colors alone .",
    "we define ssfr to be the ratio of the sfr inside the fiber to the total stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "we use this mix of fiber and total quantities rather than using the stellar mass within the fiber to avoid introducing bias into our sample . the ratio of the fiber to total stellar",
    "mass varies systematically with sfr , in the sense that higher sfr galaxies have higher fiber masses at fixed total mass , so mixing the two different types of stellar mass measurements in the same analysis of the @xmath7 relation is problematic .",
    "the ssfrs reported for the galaxies in our sample are lower than the true values of ssfr by a factor of @xmath22 , since the total stellar mass includes more of the galaxy than the star formation rate measurement . again , because we primarily use ssfr as a ranking parameter , our analysis is robust to systematic offsets such as those that affect ssfr .    to ensure that metallicities are well - measured",
    ", we exclude galaxies with low signal - to - noise ratios ( s / ns ) in the emission lines used to measure metallicity .",
    "however , since line strengths correlate with metallicity , we must check that imposing s / n cuts does not induce biases against high or low metallicity galaxies in a way that correlates with @xmath3 or sfr .",
    "figure  [ bias_fig ] demonstrates the effect of requiring a minimum s /",
    "n in metallicity - sensitive lines , for a subset of our initial galaxy sample in a narrow range of stellar mass , @xmath23 .",
    "each panel corresponds to one of six different emission lines , and within each panel galaxies are binned by sfr and s / n in that line .",
    "color indicates the median metallicity in each bin , as measured in section  [ d13_grid_sec ] below .",
    "the dashed line in each panel shows a possible s / n cut ( 25 for h@xmath24 , 5 for h@xmath25 , and 3 for all other lines ) .    for the lines in the top row of figure  [ bias_fig ] ,",
    "there is no strong variation in @xmath2 with s / n , suggesting that s / n cuts on these lines would not introduce bias in the median metallicity as a function of sfr .",
    "however , for the lines in the bottom row , there are clear trends between @xmath2 and s / n .",
    "higher metallicity galaxies have lower s / n in oxygen lines , whereas lower metallicity galaxies have lower s / n in nitrogen lines .",
    "these trends hold regardless of which narrow bin of @xmath3 we choose , though more galaxies would be removed by such s / n cuts in higher @xmath3 bins .",
    "we therefore require that galaxies have s / n of at least 25 in the @xmath18 line ( following m10 ) , at least 5 in the @xmath19 line and at least 3 in the @xmath26 \\lambda 6717 $ ] and @xmath26 \\lambda 6731 $ ] lines .",
    "we do not cut galaxies with low s / n in oxygen or nitrogen lines to ensure that our sample is not biased against galaxies of high or low metallicities at low sfr .",
    "following these s / n cuts , our main sample contains 135,194 galaxies .",
    "90% of these galaxies have s / n of at least 13.8 in the @xmath27 \\lambda 6584 $ ] line and at least @xmath28 in most of the oxygen lines .",
    "the only line of interest with relatively low s / n is @xmath29 \\lambda 4959 $ ] ; 90% of galaxies have s / n of at least 0.6 in this line .",
    "figure  [ pdfs ] gives an overview of the distribution of galaxy properties in our main galaxy sample .",
    "these two - dimensional histograms show how sfr and ssfr vary with @xmath3 .",
    "each column is normalized separately such that a vertical slice gives the conditional probability distribution of the sfr or ssfr , given a value of stellar mass .",
    "the left panel shows a clear tendency for lower @xmath3 galaxies to have lower sfrs , though at the lowest masses , higher sfrs become more likely .",
    "this reflects the fact that more vigorously star - forming galaxies are more luminous and are therefore more likely to be included in the sample near the magnitude and surface brightness limits of the spectroscopic survey . if the trend at higher masses is extended down to @xmath30 , then the expected @xmath31 would be @xmath32 , much lower than is observed .",
    "similarly , the right panel shows that the conditional probability distribution in ssfr is skewed toward high ssfr at the lowest masses . _",
    "the inherent sample bias toward high ( s)sfr at @xmath33 should be kept in mind . _    for some analyses in this paper ,",
    "we require galaxy structural parameters .",
    "we use parameters derived from pure srsic model fits to the @xmath16-band sdss images from @xcite .",
    "these structural parameters are only available for @xmath34 of the galaxies in our main galaxy sample .",
    "we refer to this subset of galaxies as the _ structural sample_.          we calculate gas phase metallicities ( oxygen abundances ) using three different strong line methods : ( 1 ) the prescription employed by m10 , ( 2 ) the diagnostic grids of d13 , and ( 3 ) the calibration of d16 .",
    "the first metallicity calculation is done to ensure that we can reproduce the results of m10 , and we use this relation as a baseline when we compare to the results from other diagnostics .",
    "we focus on results from the d13 diagnostic grids , but include a comparison to the updated calibration of d16 for completeness .",
    "our aim here is to assess the dependence of the strength of the correlation between the mass - metallicity relation and sfr on the particular abundance diagnostic used .    when using strong emission line methods to measure metallicity , one must be wary of potential degeneracies between @xmath2 and ionization parameter @xmath35 , defined to be the ratio of ionizing photon number flux to the density of hydrogen atoms , in units of cm s@xmath36 .",
    "a given emission line ratio can correspond to many different pairs of @xmath2 and @xmath35 values , so methods that determine @xmath2 from a single line ratio implicitly assume some value of @xmath35 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the dependence on ionization parameter is particularly important when considering variations in metallicity with sfr , since variations in the latter may well affect @xmath35 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , leading to spurious correlations between @xmath2 and sfr if not taken into account .",
    "we first check that we are able to reproduce the relation between metallicity , stellar mass , and star formation rate found by m10 .",
    "the empirical / theoretical calibrations of @xcite are used to obtain two different measures of oxygen abundance from the r23 index @xcite , defined as @xmath37}\\lambda \\lambda 3726,3729 + \\mathrm{[o \\ , \\textsc{iii}]}\\lambda \\lambda 4959,5007}{\\mathrm{h}\\beta},\\ ] ] and from the n2 index @xcite , @xmath38}\\lambda 6584/\\mathrm{h}\\alpha$ ] .",
    "if both ratios are within the metallicity range within which the conversions were calibrated , only galaxies for which the two metallicity measurements agree within 0.25 dex are kept in the sample , and the metallicities of such galaxies are taken to be the average of the two metallicity measurements .",
    "this cut excludes @xmath39 of galaxies with very discrepant metallicity measurements , leaving us with @xmath40 star - forming galaxies .",
    "this is the main star - forming galaxy sample that we use throughout the paper .",
    "the @xcite metallicity calibrations are polynomial fits to the relations between the r23 and n2 indices and metallicities determined from the theoretically calibrated @xcite technique , for the high - mass sdss galaxies ( direct method metallicities are used for low - mass galaxies ) .",
    "while the @xcite method does iteratively solve for both ionization parameter and metallicity , the polynomial fit relating the metallicity to a value of a given emission line ratio erases any information about the ionization parameter .",
    "this empirical / theoretical calibration effectively fixes the value of the ionization parameter , which introduces some bias into the metallicity measurements in a way that will correlate with sfr .",
    "furthermore , the @xcite method was calibrated using an older version of the ` mappings ` photoionization code that used now outdated atomic data .",
    "this has a significant effect on the derived metallicities , as the old atomic data caused an overestimate of the electron temperature and therefore an underestimate of the metallicity @xcite . taking these issues into account",
    ", it is quite likely that the m10 metallicities suffer from systematic errors that could potentially impact the observed strength of the correlation between metallicity and sfr .",
    ".emission line ratios used in the four abundance diagnostic grids from d13 considered in this paper . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      the values of @xmath24 reported in table  [ alphas_table ] are those that give the minimum scatter in the _ median _ values of @xmath2 in bins of @xmath41 and sfr ( on the order of 100 measurements ) about the median @xmath42 relation .",

    "all bins have 0.15 dex width in each @xmath50 and @xmath48 and each bin contains at least 50 galaxies . the dashed line at @xmath51 is shown for reference ; @xmath52 galaxies ( 14.5 % of the sample ) lie to the right of this line .",
    "this figure demonstrates that metallicity is only strongly anti - correlated with ssfr in the high ssfr regime .",
    "[ ssfr_fig],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we transition to casting this relation in terms of specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) , defined as @xmath53 .",
    "this quantity describes the relative importance of recent and past star formation , and is potentially more sensitive to signatures of recent gas infall than sfr .",
    "figure  [ ssfr_fig ] shows the median metallicity in bins of stellar mass and ssfr as a function of ssfr , with metallicity calculated using the fiducial d13 grid . at small ssfr ,",
    "the metallicity is less dependent on ssfr ; i.e. , the lines of constant mass are flatter at low ssfr .",
    "there is a more notable decrease in @xmath2 with increasing ssfr at high ssfr , though again , the decrease we find is smaller than that found by m10 . throughout the remainder of the paper ,",
    "a boundary between these low and high ssfr regimes is indicated for reference by a dashed line at @xmath54 wherever a quantity is plotted against ssfr .",
    "this is a rough , qualitative split , and should not be taken to mean that a sharp transition in star formation behavior occurs at exactly this ssfr boundary .",
    "a starburst galaxy is typically defined as a galaxy with @xmath55 . defining @xmath56 and assuming a typical galaxy age @xmath57",
    ", we see that @xmath58 for @xmath54 .",
    "effectively then , most galaxies to the right of the dashed line in figure  [ ssfr_fig ] are starburst galaxies .",
    "the measure of ssfr used here , fiber sfr divided by total @xmath3 , underestimates the ssfr by a factor of @xmath22 , so the galaxies in the high ssfr regime are actually even more starburst - like than they seem .",
    "these are rarer than the galaxies in the low ssfr regime , both in the local universe and in our sample .",
    "only @xmath52 galaxies , or 14.5% of the sample , lie in the high ssfr regime .",
    "we quantify the different strengths of correlation between metallicity and sfr in these two regimes of low and high specific sfr by computing the best fitting values of @xmath24 for two subsamples of galaxies : ( 1 ) those with @xmath59 , and ( 2 ) those with @xmath60 for both the m10 and d13 abundance diagnostics .",
    "selecting high ( low ) ssfr galaxies does , by definition , remove low ( high ) sfr galaxies at a fixed mass , which reduces the scatter in median metallicities in bins of @xmath3 ( or @xmath43 ) and sfr about the median mass - metallicity relation for each of these subsamples .",
    "however , if there is any secondary correlation between metallicity and sfr within one of these subsamples , a nonzero value of @xmath24 will further reduce the scatter about the median @xmath42 relation .",
    "we find , for all methods of calculating metallicity , that there is a weaker anti - correlation between @xmath2 and sfr in the low ssfr regime than in the sparsely populated high ssfr regime ( table  [ alphas_table ] ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite found variation in the strength of anti - correlation between metallicity and offset in ssfr from the star - forming main sequence .",
    "the interesting result here is that the @xmath61 of galaxies in this sample that exhibit strong anti - correlation between @xmath2 and sfr lie in the tails of the ssfr distribution at high @xmath3 or in a biased regime of parameter space at low @xmath3 ( figure  [ pdfs ] ) . _",
    "the observed correlation of the mzr with sfr and ssfr across the local galaxy population is driven by the relatively rare galaxies in the high ssfr regime , _ with sfrs that are elevated compared to their past average .",
    "recently , @xcite ( hereafter k16 ) argued that there is no anti - correlation between @xmath2 and sfr at fixed @xmath3 when the d16 metallicity diagnostic is used .",
    "they interpret this to mean that abundance diagnostics using the [ n ii]/[s ii ] ratio can not be used to detect the @xmath7 relation , assuming it is driven by infall of pristine gas causing increased star formation . in this scenario ,",
    "the overall metallicity decreases due to gas infall , but the relative abundances of n and s remain unchanged , making the [ n ii]/[s ii ] ratio insensitive to the change in metallicity .",
    "however , we show here that the d13 grids using [ n ii]/[s ii ] and [ n ii]/[o ii ] as abundance - sensitive lines do produce weak , but nonzero , anti - correlations between @xmath2 and sfr .",
    "we compare our results from the d13 grids to those from the d16 diagnostic in figure  [ d13_comp ] and in table  [ alphas_table ] .",
    "we do find a best fitting @xmath62 for the d16 diagnostic , indicating no anti - correlation with sfr across the entire sample .",
    "this result is comparable to the low @xmath63 derived for the d13 n2s2o3s2 grid ( which also uses the [ n ii]/[s ii ] ratio ) , as can be seen by comparing the bottom right panel of figure  [ d13_comp ] to the right panel of figure  [ d13_fmr ] .",
    "however , while the overall values of @xmath24 are low for both the d13 n2s2o3s2 grid and d16 diagnostic , both show stronger correlations between @xmath2 and sfr at high ssfr , in agreement with other d13 grids .",
    "the downturns in @xmath2 at high sfr are weaker , but still present , in the @xmath7 relation produced by the d16 diagnostic .",
    "we compute the best fitting values of @xmath24 for the d16 diagnostic in the low and high ssfr regimes , and find that there is a weak anti - correlation between @xmath2 and sfr in the high ssfr regime for the d16 grid ( table  [ alphas_table ] ) .",
    "this suggests that diagnostics relying on [ n ii]/[s ii ] actually are capable of detecting the @xmath7 relation .",
    "this ratio may , in fact , be sensitive to changes in the overall metallicity even if the relative abundances of n and s are unchanged , or the mechanism driving the @xmath7 relation may cause variation in the n / s ratio .",
    "our results using the d16 grid are qualitatively different from those of k16 , in that we see weak anti - correlation between @xmath2 and sfr in the high ssfr regime , and they do not .",
    "further , they report a reversal in the sense of the correlation between @xmath2 and sfr at high stellar masses . both of these differences can be attributed to different choices made in sample selection and the measurement of the various quantities .",
    "we demonstrate in section  [ sample ] above that applying s / n cuts on the forbidden lines induces bias against high metallicity galaxies at low sfr .",
    "k16 use s / n cuts on oxygen lines , which cause the apparent reversal at high stellar masses .",
    "they also use their own stellar mass determinations , which , as we discuss in section  [ mass_sec ] below , likely affects the apparent strength of the @xmath7 relation .",
    "we now discuss the systematic errors that may enter into the measurement of stellar masses and what role such biases might play in the observed strength of the @xmath7 relation .",
    "stellar masses in the mpa / jhu catalog are calculated by fitting the galaxy s photometry with a large library of model spectral energy distributions ( seds ) constructed using a range of values for parameters such as dust attenuation , stellar mass , star formation history ( sfh ) , metallicity , and age .",
    "probability density functions ( pdfs ) are constructed for each galaxy parameter such that the values of parameters corresponding to better fits are assigned higher likelihood .",
    "the median of the resulting stellar mass pdf for each galaxy is used as the best estimate of its stellar mass in the present study .",
    "many ingredients that are required for any sed fitting procedure are highly uncertain , including the initial mass function , models of stellar evolution ( in particular , the treatment of luminous , poorly understood phases of post main sequence evolution ; see @xcite ) , the relative geometry of the dust and stars , and the form of the sfh .",
    "stellar masses derived using different fitting methods and/or stellar evolutionary models vary by up to a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "the chosen parametrization of the sfh can change the derived logarithmic stellar mass even more , up to @xmath64 at low redshift @xcite . for thorough discussions of the uncertainties that enter into the derivation of stellar masses from sed fitting ,",
    "see reviews by @xcite and @xcite .    given these substantial uncertainties , it is possible that stellar masses are biased high or low in cases where fits of the template spectra to the photometry yield uncertain stellar mass measurements .",
    "when the data can not be used to place strong constraints on model parameters , the derived stellar mass becomes increasingly dependent on input assumptions , e.g. , the form of the sfh and priors on the various parameters .",
    "these issues motivate us to investigate whether uncertainties in the stellar mass determinations may play a role in the observed correlation between the mzr and sfr .",
    "figure  [ m_err_fig ] shows the median uncertainty in the stellar mass in bins of @xmath65 and ssfr as a function of ssfr . here , uncertainty is defined as half of the difference between the 84th percentile and 16th percentile values of the @xmath66 pdf given in the mpa / jhu catalog .",
    "this value is comparable to a @xmath67 uncertainty .",
    "these values reflect the formal errors in the model fits , but do not include any estimates of systematic uncertainties . in the high ssfr regime , the uncertainty in the stellar mass increases across all mass bins , meaning that the pdf widens .",
    "this behavior is reasonable , as the mass - to - light ratio becomes more uncertain when galaxy light is dominated by young , blue stars which obscure the older , fainter stellar population .",
    "it is particularly interesting that this upturn in stellar mass uncertainty occurs at roughly the same value of ssfr where the anti - correlation between @xmath2 and sfr begins to strengthen , indicated by the vertical dashed line in figure  [ m_err_fig ] .",
    "this raises the question of whether bias in the stellar mass measurements at high ssfr could drive the downturn in metallicity . in the case that stellar mass is preferentially overestimated relative to the true value ,",
    "galaxies assigned to a given mass bin would in reality have smaller masses and therefore smaller metallicities ( according to the mzr ) .",
    "if enough lower mass galaxies contaminate a higher mass bin at high ssfr , this could decrease the median metallicity , causing the appearance of a stronger correlation between metallicity and sfr .     as a function of ssfr .",
    "uncertainty is defined as half of the difference between the values of @xmath50 at the 84th percentile of the probability distribution and the 16th percentile reported in the mpa / jhu catalog .",
    "binning is performed as in figure  [ ssfr_fig ] .",

    "this correlation with ssfr is stronger than that found with the fiducial d13 grid ( @xmath74 ) and nearly as strong as that found with the m10 metallicity diagnostic ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "this level of bias is within the realm of possibility , given that much work remains to be done in understanding systematic issues in stellar population synthesis modeling at high ssfr .",
    "this exercise has shown that it is possible that preferentially overestimating @xmath3 at high ssfr could induce a spurious anti - correlation between the mzr and sfr .",
    "however , there is no reason to expect that stellar masses should be biased high in particular , and there is some evidence that stellar masses are actually underestimated in the high ssfr regime ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the sfrs used in this paper and in m10 are calculated from the @xmath18 flux within the spectroscopic fiber .",
    "therefore , given that star formation is known to also occur in the outskirts of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a larger fraction of the total star formation activity in a galaxy will be measured for more distant galaxies .",
    "using photometric sfr indicators instead of fiber spectroscopy does not cause the @xmath7 relation to disappear , and both types of sfr measurements can yield relations with comparable strengths @xcite .",

    "similarly , gas phase metallicity is known to decrease toward the outer portions of most star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , though some galaxies have been found to have large oxygen abundances in their outskirts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that edge - on galaxies have lower metallicities than the mzr would predict for their stellar mass .",
    "they argue that the fiber covers more of the disk in such galaxies , so the low metallicity gas in the outskirts contributes to the measured metallicity .    however , the measured metallicity of a galaxy is a flux - weighted mean .",
    "even if there is low metallicity gas outside of the central region covered by the fiber , it would only contribute to the measured global metallicity in a larger aperture if a significant amount of emission line flux were coming from the outskirts .",
    "therefore , the amount by which aperture effects change the measured metallicity depends on the spatial distribution of star - forming regions within a given galaxy .",

    "notably , @xcite found that a minimum covering fraction of 20% is needed , corresponding to a minimum redshift @xmath79 for sdss ( the minimum in our sample is @xmath80 ) .",
    "however , they note that a higher minimum redshift is required if the sample contains many late type or high luminosity galaxies , and that the threshold must be higher still for the metallicities of most galaxies in a sample to approximate the global value .",
    "to test empirically whether aperture effects may be affecting measured metallicities and sfrs , in figure  [ covering_frac_fig ] we plot the median radius , normalized by the half - light radius , covered by the sdss fiber in bins of @xmath3 and ssfr .",

    "the two lowest @xmath3 bins in previous plots do not appear in figure  [ covering_frac_fig ] because structural parameters are available for too few of the low mass , low surface brightness galaxies .",
    "we have removed 235 galaxies with anomalously small @xmath76 measurements ( @xmath81 ) from the sample for this plot to avoid artificially large dispersions within @xmath3 bins ; this does not affect our median coverage results .",
    "the clear correlation between the size covered by the fiber and the ssfr seen in figure  [ covering_frac_fig ] is due to sdss sample selection . at a fixed stellar mass ,",
    "higher sfr galaxies tend to have higher surface brightness , and thus those galaxies sample a larger volume in the magnitude - limited sdss",
    ". therefore , higher ssfr galaxies are , on average , more distant and a larger fraction of their area is covered by the sdss fiber .",
    "figure  [ covering_frac_fig ] shows that galaxies in the high ssfr regime have at least @xmath82 covered by the spectroscopic fiber in the median , so the derived ssfr and @xmath2 sample the conditions in the outskirts of those galaxies .",
    "low ssfr galaxies have a median coverage of less than @xmath82 , raising the possibility that low ssfr galaxies may have systematically larger metallicities measured at fixed mass because their metallicities and sfrs are measured for the central regions only .    given the trend of increasing covering fraction with ssfr observed in our data , it is possible that aperture effects could bias metallicity measurements such that low ssfr galaxies appear to have higher metallicities at fixed stellar mass .",

    "note that the bins in the right panel are more populated than the bins in the left panel , since the two samples have equal numbers of galaxies , but the highly reddened sample spans fewer bins in @xmath3 and ssfr .",
    "_ strikingly , the overall shape of the @xmath47 relation is different for the slightly and the highly reddened galaxy samples . _",
    "the relation for the slightly reddened galaxies is similar to that found for the full sample , though metallicity does decrease somewhat with ssfr even in the low ssfr regime .",
    "this trend results in a stronger sfr dependence for the slightly reddened sample ( @xmath85 vs. @xmath63 for the main sample ) . for the highly reddened sample ,",
    "the metallicity curves are flatter in the low ssfr regime , and the sense of the correlation with ssfr even reverses for the lowest stellar mass bins such that higher ssfr galaxies have higher metallicities .    we have checked that these results do not depend on the particular metallicity calibration used ( table  [ alphas_table ] ) .",
    "given that the fiducial d13 grid is the least reddening - sensitive of all the metallicity calibrations analyzed in this paper , this grid should yield the smallest differences in metallicity between slightly and highly reddened galaxies , and should be unaffected by the choice of reddening law .",
    "we have also checked that splitting the sample in half based on inclination does not change the strength of correlation with sfr ( not shown ) .",
    "we conclude that the changing shape of the @xmath47 relation for the slightly and highly reddened galaxies is related to the dust content and not to orientation , but the physical interpretation remains unclear .",

    "the grids simultaneously determine both the ionization parameter and metallicity for each galaxy , minimizing possible biases in the metallicity measurements due to degeneracies between these parameters .",

    "these problems with characterizing the metallicity and ionization state of entire galaxies using the d13 grids could introduce biases into the measurement of metallicity and ionization parameter and could alter the observed relationship between these quantities and @xmath3 and sfr ; we revisit systematic effects on the ionization parameter in the appendix .",

    "the observed correlation between the mass - metallicity relation and ( s)sfr presents a challenge to theories of the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "while much theoretical work has focused on the physics governing the mass - metallicity relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , relatively few models have specifically attempted to account for the more recently observed @xmath7 relation .",

    "@xcite argued that the observed @xmath7 relation can be explained by variations in outflow efficiency with stellar mass , assuming that outflows scale with the sfr .",
    "the ability of these different models to account for an anti - correlation between metallicity and sfr indicates that such a relationship could be a natural outcome of how galaxies regulate inflows , outflows , and star formation , though no consensus has been reached regarding the mechanisms governing such regulation .",
    "interestingly , all of these models suggest that the gas content of galaxies is the fundamental driver of the observed @xmath7 relation , and that the ( s)sfr of galaxies is changing in response to changes in the gas content .",
    "recent observational studies corroborate the notion that the gas content may be the more fundamental  third parameter \" in the mzr @xcite .",
    "however , these studies of atomic and molecular gas content are restricted to relatively small sample sizes compared to studies using sfr as the third parameter .",
    "a further challenge to chemical evolution models is our observation that the anti - correlation between @xmath2 and sfr is only important in the high ssfr regime , where galaxies current sfrs are higher than their past average sfrs ( @xmath90 of our sample ) .",
    "it appears that these galaxies are undergoing a fundamentally different mode of star formation than the majority of the galaxy population ( e.g. , following major accretion events or mergers ; a similar suggestion was made by @xcite ) .",
    "a viable chemical evolution model should account for the different behaviors in the low vs. high ssfr regimes .",
    "some theoretical studies have used the observed @xmath7 relation to predict other properties of the galaxy population , such as the relation between stellar mass and stellar metallicity at @xmath91 @xcite and variations in accretion and outflow rates @xcite . however",
    ", since the large systematic uncertainties inherent in metallicity and stellar mass measurements will be propagated into any parameters constrained using the observed @xmath7 relation , models should not be tuned to match any single observational result .",
    "rather , at this stage , models attempting to explain the physical origin of the anti - correlation between @xmath2 and sfr or using the observed relation in analytical models to make predictions for other quantities should be flexible enough to account for a wide range of possible strengths of the relation .",

    "the d13 grids were calibrated to the relationship between the n / o abundance ratio and metallicity using measurements of h ii regions from @xcite .",

    "third , the metallicities derived from different grids largely follow linear relationships with each other .",
    "the exception to this last point is the n2s2o3o2 grid , which we have already demonstrated is problematic .",
    "this grid gives higher metallicities than all other grids at high @xmath2 , even assigning many galaxies the maximum allowed metallicity .",
    "this is expected from the fact that many galaxies ( @xmath96 , 5% of the sample ) fall off of this grid at high @xmath2 and indicates that the n2s2-o3o2 grid should not be considered a reliable abundance diagnostic .",

    "it is possible that the fitted value of @xmath35 is very sensitive to inherent differences between modeled and actual spectra .",
    "we now examine trends in @xmath35 with @xmath3 and sfr .",
    "each panel of figure  [ q_fig ] is analogous to the right panel of figure  [ m10_fmr ] , but shows the median value of ionization parameter @xmath35 ( instead of metallicity ) in bins of @xmath3 and sfr , where @xmath35 is calculated using each of the four different d13 grids .",
    "generally , ionization parameter increases with sfr at low @xmath3 , but this trend either flattens or reverses at high @xmath3 .",
    "the two grids that depend on [ n ii]/[s ii ] yield a positive correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath35 at high @xmath3 .",
    "these four grids produce strikingly different relationships between @xmath35 , sfr , and @xmath3 , and in particular , yield correlations between @xmath35 and @xmath3 that have different senses .",
    "it has been hypothesized that the mean ionization parameter should decrease with increasing @xmath3 , since stellar winds with higher metallicities are more opaque , allowing fewer ionizing photons to escape into the ism @xcite .",
    "figure  [ q_fig ] shows that the correlation of ionization parameter with mass derived using some of the d13 grids ( including the fiducial grid , top left panel ) do not conform to this expectation .",
    "the only grid that produces the expected correlation between @xmath35 and @xmath3 is the n2o2o3o2 grid ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "a common feature of ionization parameters derived from all four grids is that @xmath35 does not depend strongly on sfr at high stellar masses ( above @xmath99 ) .",
    "the strong correlation with sfr at low masses is likely due to the fact that at low stellar masses , only a small number of star - forming regions are covered by the spectroscopic fiber .",
    "more vigorous star formation yields more ionizing radiation and therefore a higher ionization parameter , so the measured value of @xmath35 is highly dependent on the properties of the few observed star - forming regions in those galaxies .",
    "the sfr independence at high @xmath3 can be explained by the spectra of high mass galaxies covering a much larger number of star - forming regions ( up to hundreds ) , therefore averaging over the conditions in all of those regions and fully sampling the imf ."
