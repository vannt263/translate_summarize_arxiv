    "x - ray observations of the intracluster medium ( icm ) indicate that in the cores of some galaxy clusters , the gas with high density and low entropy has a cooling time much shorter than the hubble time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these clusters are often called `` cool - core clusters . '' in the absence of heating , cold gas is expected to condense out of the icm in the center of cool - core clusters , driving an inflow ( the so - called `` cooling flow '' ) at rates of 100s-1000 @xmath3 ( see review by * ? ? ?",

    "numerical simulations have shown that agn feedback in the form of momentum - driven jets can successfully suppress cooling in both cosmological simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ". however , multiphase gas usually only exists at early times of the simulations ( up to 1 - 2 gyr ) , and due to the conservation of angular momentum , much of the gas that has initially cooled forms a massive cold disk of @xmath4 that persists for many gyr through the end of the simulation .",
    "observations of optical and ir line emission shows great diversity in the properties of multiphase gas in cool - core clusters : some systems host extended filamentary cold gas like the perseus cluster @xcite ; some only have detections in the nuclei ; some do not seem to harbor any cold gas @xcite .",
    "the amount of cold gas detected is also typically smaller than @xmath5 @xcite .",

    "star formation is an important process that is often overlooked in simulations focused on suppressing cooling flows with agn feedback .",

    "star formation is also largely responsible for ionizing the line - emitting filaments @xcite . however , exactly how star formation in the bcgs is connected to the cooling of the icm is not well understood , and there is a lack of detailed modeling of star formation in these largest galaxies .    in this paper , we carry out three - dimensional adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) simulations to study the interplay between icm cooling , star formation and agn feedback in an idealized cool - core galaxy cluster .",
    "the model is based on our previous work that focused on the balance between cooling and momentum - driven agn feedback ( lb14a & lb14b ) .",
    "besides cooling and agn feedback , we also include the self - gravity of the gas , star formation , and stellar feedback in the standard run presented here .",
    "the goal of this work is to gain a better understanding of the following issues : ( 1 ) how does agn suppress icm cooling and mediate star formation ?",

    "the smbh accretion and jet modeling is the same as in lb14a & b. here we only repeat the key aspects .",
    "we calculate the accretion rate @xmath33 at each time step by dividing the total amount of cold gas in the close vicinity ( @xmath34 pc ) of the smbh by a typical accretion time ( 5 myr ) .",
    "then a fraction of the cold gas mass within the accretion region is removed in proportion to the cell mass .",
    "the agn jets in our simulations are modeled as bipolar outflows along the @xmath35-axis from two parallel jet launching planes @xcite . the jet launching planes are parallel to the x - y plane , at a distance of 2 cell lengths from the smbh located at the center of the simulation domain . within the jet launching planes ,",

    "therefore @xmath39 can be normalized by setting @xmath40 .",
    "our simulations are far from being able to resolve the accretion physics .",

    "* ) , we enforce a small angle ( @xmath48 ) precession on the jet with a period of 10 myr .",
    "the star formation is modeled following @xcite .",
    "a star particle is created in a cell when the following set of criteria is met : 1 ) the gas density exceeds a certain value ( @xmath49 is used in our simulations ) , 2 ) the gas mass exceeds the local jeans mass , 3 ) the flow is convergent , and 4 ) the cooling time of the gas is shorter than the dynamical time of the gas in the cell ( @xmath50 ) . when all of the criteria are met , a fraction of the gas within the cell is converted into a star particle : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the star formation efficiency and is set to be 0.02 in our simulations . if @xmath53 is above the minimum mass for star particles , @xmath54 , then the star particle is created . when @xmath55 , a star particle is created with a probability of @xmath56 , and its mass would be @xmath54 or @xmath57 of the gas mass in the cell , whichever is smaller .",

    "the feedback in the form of thermal energy from each star particle is @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is set to be @xmath66 .",
    "both mass and energy feedback are injected locally to the cell that contains the star particle .",
    "we discuss how stellar feedback and the choice of star formation parameters affect the results in section  [ sec : results_3 ] .",
    "in this section we present the main results of the simulations .",
    "section  [ sec : results_1 ] describes the cluster evolution in the standard run , and in section  [ sec : results_2 ] we examine the intricate relationship between cooling , star formation , and agn feedback . in section  [ sec : results_3 ] we discuss other simulations that we have performed to study the role each physical process plays and the impact of changing some of the important simulation parameters .",
    "the cluster evolution in the first few hundred myr is similar to that in lb14a & b : about 300 myr ( @xmath67 the initial minimum cooling time of the gas ) after we start the simulation , runaway cooling happens first in the very center of the cluster .",
    "the cold gas is accreted onto the smbh and turns on the agn jets ; the jets then perturb the icm in a non - linear fashion , dragging out low entropy gas with short cooling time to larger radii , causing it to cool into clumps along the jet path .",
    "a detailed analysis of this cooling process can be found in lb14b .",
    "these cold , dense clumps have a lower pressure than the surrounding icm , which drives more hot gas to cool onto them , but as the clumps move through the hot icm they also suffer from shock heating , ram pressure stripping and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , which can reduce their masses or even destroy them completely .",
    "the fate of individual clumps is uncertain ( as they are numerical difficult to model accurately ) , but at the beginning of the clump formation stage the growth generally overwhelms destruction .",
    "the cold clumps fall to the center of the cluster roughly within a dynamical time .",
    "some of the cold gas is accreted onto the smbh , boosting its power , which increases the entropy of the icm , halting clump formation .",
    "some of the cold clumps also form stars , and stellar feedback heats up the cold gas locally , reducing its mass . the total amount of cold gas in the first 1.5 gyr peaks at only @xmath68 and does not form a rotationally supported disk ( the first row of figure  [ fig : multi ] ) . at t @xmath69 gyr , all the cold gas has vanished and the agn shuts off .",
    "the cluster enters a state that is very similar to the initial condition except that the gas is now turbulent .",
    "the second cycle is similar to the first one . at the end of the first cycle ,",
    "the shortest cooling time of the icm is only a few hundred myr . with the agn heating off ,",
    "the icm quickly cools again .",
    "due to the turbulent motion of the gas , runaway cooling first happens @xmath70 kpc from the cluster center ( the second row of figure  [ fig : multi ] ) from a blob of low entropy gas at t  @xmath71 gyr .",
    "the cooled gas shortly gets accreted onto the smbh , turning the agn back on .",
    "the agn jets trigger more hot gas to cool into filamentary structures , resulting in a burst of star formation and agn feedback ( the third row of figure  [ fig : multi ] ) . the total amount of cold gas peaks at @xmath72 , about one order of magnitude higher than the previous cycle .",
    "cooling out of the icm at a few tens of kpc , the cold gas carries a non - zero total angular momentum . due to the larger amount of cold gas in this cycle",
    "( and higher total angular momentum ) , smbh accretion and star formation can not consume all of it quickly enough before the gas settles to a rotating disk in the center of the cluster at t@xmath73 gyr .",
    "the cluster enters a stage that appears very similar to the last stage of the simulations with agn feedback only ( lb14a ) : the agn outburst has elevated the entropy of the icm in the cluster core ; all the gas with short cooling time ( @xmath67 a few hundred myr ) has already cooled , and thus clump formation has stopped ; the icm cools directly onto the rotationally supported cold disk ; the smbh continues to accrete from the inner part of the cold disk , keeping the agn jets on , which balances the icm cooling ( the fourth row of figure  [ fig : multi ] ) . in the simulations with agn only , due to the conservation of angular momentum",
    ", a disk of @xmath74 lasts through the end of the simulation without showing signs of shrinking ( lb14a ) . in the standard",

    "the disk is completely gone ( the last row of figure  [ fig : multi ] ) .",
    "this marks the end of the second cycle .",
    "the third cycle begins at @xmath78 gyr and ends around @xmath79 gyr . at the end of our simulation at roughly @xmath80 gyr",
    ", there is no cold gas , and both agn and star formation are off , but the icm is cooling and ready to enter yet another cycle .",
    "figure  [ fig : multi ] also shows that the star forming regions ( the fourth column ) are spatially correlated with the cold dense gas ( first two columns ) .",
    "a comparison between the morphology of the cold gas in our previous higher resolution simulations ( lb14a&b ) and the high quality uv images of bcgs in clash @xcite is presented in donahue et al .",
    "2015 ( submitted to apj ) .",
    "interestingly , the cycle we see in our simulation , in which cold , filamentary star - forming gas settles into a central disk and then disappears , also echoes the hypothesized dust - cloud evolution sequence in @xcite based on hubble observations of 77 early - type galaxies .",
    "both agn and star formation are fueled by the cold gas that cools out of the hot icm .",
    "agn feedback heats the icm and regulates its cooling rate , while star formation consumes the cold gas and thus affects the agn duty cycle . in this section , we study the intricate relationship between the icm cooling , agn feedback and star formation .",
    "there are many ways of measuring the cooling properties of the hot icm in the core of the cluster , such as temperature , central entropy , and classical cooling rate ( which is often defined as the cooling rate within the cooling radius where the cooling time is a few gyr ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is also found that precipitation in cool - core clusters is tightly linked to the minimum ratio of the cooling time over the free - fall time @xmath81 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since central entropy , classical cooling rate , and the minimum ratio convey very similar information ( low central entropy translates to high classical cooling rate and low minimum ratio ) , we mainly use the minimum ratio to characterize the cooling properties of the icm and we show its evolution with time in figure  [ fig:5in1 ] , along with the minimum cooling time @xmath82 , smbh accretion rate , sfr and the total amount of cold gas . note that we use the shell averaged @xmath82 as is done in observations , instead of the actual value measured in each cell .",
    "the minimum @xmath81 ratio approaches its local minimum at the beginning of every cycle .",
    "when agn feedback is just turned on , this ratio still decreases for a very brief period of time .",
    "it takes roughly one dynamical time ( a few tens of myr at @xmath83 kpc ) for most of the cold clumps to reach the smbh and trigger the agn outburst .",
    "the instantaneous smbh accretion rate shows very large variations , but when we take its average with a moving window of 200 myr , the trend is clear ( the black line in the third panel of figure  [ fig:5in1 ] ) .",
    "the minimum ratio starts to increase right before the agn outflow rate ( also equal to the smbh accretion rate in our model ) reaches its peak . in every cycle , within 1 gyr of the time that the agn is turned on ,",
    "all the gas with short @xmath82 of a few hundred myr has either cooled or been heated to higher temperatures by the agn jets .",
    "the minimum @xmath81 ratio is elevated . in cases where star formation can not consume the cold gas quickly enough and a rotationally - supported disk forms ( e.g. , the second cycle ) ,",
    "this ratio plateaus because the agn self - regulates through the cold disk ( see lb14a for details ) .",
    "as soon as the cold gas vanishes , which turns off agn feedback , the icm starts to cool .",
    "as one would expect , precipitation begins again after a period @xmath84 , marking the beginning of the next cycle .",
    "the evolution of the star formation rate ( sfr ) is very similar to that of the average @xmath33 , while the history of the total amount of cold gas basically mirrors the sfr .",
    "both @xmath82 and the minimum @xmath81 ratio indicate the general cooling properties of the icm , but do not directly translate to the mass deposition rate ",
    "i.e. , the rate at which the icm is cooling into the cold phase .",
    "since an amr code does not trace the history of fluid elements , we can only estimate this mass deposition rate @xmath85 . we can measure the changing rate of the total amount of cold gas @xmath86 which is related to @xmath85 : @xmath87 where the last term includes many physical processes that can reduce the amount of cold gas but are not strictly measurable in the simulations : shock heating , ram pressure stripping ( of the cold clumps as they move through the hot icm ) , kelvin - helmholtz instability ( at the interface between cold clumps and the icm ) and sn heating .",
    "the first few processes are only significant when a large amount of cold clumps are present .",
    "besides star formation , the depletion of the cold gas is dominated by sn heating .    in an ideal situation where the thermal energy from sn feedback heats the cold gas exactly to the icm temperature ,",
    "we can write @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the boltzman s constant and @xmath90 ( section  [ sec : method_3 ] ) . taking @xmath91 kev and assuming a typical delay of 20 myr between star formation and sn feedback , we have @xmath92    in reality , sn might overheat a cell to higher temperatures than the icm temperature , resulting in an energy `` waste . ''",
    "more often , it under - heats the cell such that the temperature goes up to only @xmath93 or less where the cooling time is very short , and the cell quickly radiates the energy away and remains cold .",

    "is deposited within 100 kpc , and 3/5 within 300 kpc ( bottom panel of figure  [ fig : heating ] ) .",

    "this confirms that although star formation and stellar feedback have a significant impact on the cooling - agn feedback cycle , agn feedback still plays the major role in heating the icm .",
    "prior to our main simulation , we also performed runs that include star formation but no stellar feedback .",
    "the results are very similar to our standard run .",
    "this is simply because stellar feedback is only roughly as effective as star formation itself in reducing the amount of cold gas in the system ( figure  [ fig : totalmass ] ) .",

    "self - gravity triggers gravitational instabilities , and the disk shows structures that resemble the spiral arms of disk galaxies .",

    "the smbh accretion rate is enhanced due to self - gravity , but it is still not enough to consume all the cold gas in the cluster center by the end of the simulation ( within a few gyr ) .",

    "this means that self - gravity may alleviate the problem but is not the key to solving it .",
    "the other test we have performed is a simulation with all the ingredients included in our standard run except self - gravity .",
    "we find that the absence of self - gravity does not significantly alter the results .",
    "the cluster still experiences agn outburst cycles .",
    "the main difference is that without self - gravity , the sfr is less bursty than in our standard run , peaking only at @xmath111m@xmath27  yr@xmath105 .",
    "this is likely because self - gravity can affect the density distribution of the star - forming clouds and speeds up the initial collapse @xcite .",
    "another difference is that without the assistance of self - gravity , the accretion of the cold disk onto the smbh is less efficient .",
    "thus , within 6.5 gyr the cluster only experiences two major cycles rather than the three seen in our standard run .",
    "the cold disk also does not completely vanish ( but is significantly reduced in mass ) at the end the first cycle .",
    "previous simulations have found that due to self - regulation , agn feedback with a wide range of feedback efficiencies ( @xmath112 ) produces similar results ( * ? ? ? * lb14a ) .",
    "this changes when star formation is included .",
    "although star formation and smbh feedback evolve hand - in - hand ( figures  [ fig:5in1 ] and  [ fig : mdot_all ] ) as the icm goes through cycles of cooling and heating , they also compete with each other at any given time as they share the same fuel  cold dense gas .",
    "in fact , as discussed earlier , the amount of cold gas that feeds star formation is more than an order of magnitude higher than that accreted onto the smbh ( see section  [ sec : results_2 ] or figure  [ fig : sfr_smbh ] ) .    in lb14a , we chose @xmath44 over @xmath43 as our preferred value ( and thus used this value in the standard run ) mainly because a feedback efficiency of @xmath43 slightly overheats the core at late times . in the standard simulation discussed here ,",
    "we use @xmath43 because with most of the cold gas going into forming stars , a low agn feedback efficiency is no longer sufficient .",
    "figure  [ fig:5in1_low ] shows the cluster evolution for the simulation with @xmath44 and everything else kept the same as the standard run .",
    "agn feedback still manages to prevent the development of a classical cooling flow , and the cluster still shows somewhat cyclical behaviors similar to the standard run .",
    "this is not surprising since the average @xmath33 here is roughly 10 times that in the standard run , making up for the lower efficiency , manifesting again the self - regulating nature of agn feedback .",
    "however , the total mass of the cold gas in the system is almost always above @xmath113 and the sfr is also too high , with an average of 120 @xmath107  yr@xmath105 .",
    "thus a low feedback efficiency of @xmath44 can be ruled out .",
    "ratio , the minimum cooling time @xmath82 , the smbh accretion rate @xmath114 , the sfr , and the total amount of cold gas in the simulation with a lower feedback efficiency @xmath44 . the data is sampled every 10 myr and the color scheme is the same as figure  [ fig:5in1 ] . the low efficiency results in too much star formation and too much cold gas .",
    "[ fig:5in1_low ] ]      there are many parameters related to the star formation routine described in section  [ sec : method_3 ] .",
    "the values we have chosen for our simulations are typically used in simulations of star forming galaxies that produce results roughly consistent with the observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a systematic study of varying the values for all those parameters is beyond the scope of this work . here",
    "we briefly discuss the results from a test run with a lower minimum mass for star particles ( @xmath115 , 1/20 of the value used in our standard run ) .    because star particles are easier to form at the beginning of the cooling cycle",
    ", more cold gas goes into forming stars and less gets accreted onto the smbh , which leads to less energetic agn outbursts . as a result",
    ", less condensation is triggered by the jets , and the first cycle is shorter ( lasting for less than 1 gyr ) and gentler than that in the standard run .",
    "after global turbulence is built up by @xmath116  gyr , the cluster behaves more similarly to our standard run .",
    "the range of sfr and the minimum @xmath81 ratio stay roughly the same , except that the tail of the sfr distribution extends a bit further , as one might expect . as discussed in section  [ sec : results_2 ] , the direct effect of star formation and stellar feedback on the hot icm is negligible .",
    "we do not expect the results to change qualitatively when varying star formation parameters because the battle is ultimately between icm cooling and agn feedback .",
    "however , due to the complex relations between cooling , star formation and agn feedback , the exact choice of those parameters could have an effect on the strength and duration of the long term ( @xmath117 gyr ) agn cycles .",
    "in this section , we compare our results with observations and other simulations done previously ( section  [ sec : discussion_1 ] ) , and we discuss the possible impact of other physical processes on the simulation results ( in section  [ sec : discussion_2 ] ) .      a number of recent simulations show that gas condensation occurs when the minimum @xmath81 ratio of the system drops below a certain threshold .",
    "this threshold is found to be @xmath118 in simulations with idealized heating in @xcite , and @xmath109 in a spherical geometry @xcite , which is confirmed in @xcite with more realistic agn feedback .",
    "lb14b finds that the value of this critical ratio can vary between @xmath119 depending on the strength of the perturbation and the way agn jets interact with the icm ( dredging up gas with shorter @xmath82 to larger radii where @xmath120 is longer ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratio_hist ] shows the distribution of the minimum @xmath81 ratio for the times when cold gas exists in the system .",
    "precipitation can happen when the minimum @xmath81 ratio is as low as @xmath118 ( only very briefly ) when the agn is off , and as high as @xmath121 at the peak of the agn outburst when the icm is most perturbed .",
    "over - plotted in figure  [ fig : ratio_hist ] are the observations of cool - core clusters with @xmath122 detection .",
    "the bulk of the two distributions are consistent with each other .",
    "the observed distribution shows a longer tail at the high end and a deficit at the very low end where the minimum @xmath81 ratio is @xmath123 3",
    ". this discrepancy may be due to mergers and/or cosmological infall , effects that are not included in our isolated simulations .",
    "observationally , in precipitating systems the radial profile of @xmath82 is usually above @xmath124 and never below @xmath125 ( figure 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "our simulation generally agrees with this finding ( figure  [ fig : mark_time ] ) .",
    "note that we plot only the initial @xmath120 for clarity , but at later times the stars formed in the simulation also add mass and thus slightly steepen @xmath120 . despite this effect",
    ", our system is still found to have relatively low @xmath82 ( between 5 and 10 @xmath120 ) more often than the observations seem to indicate .",
    "this may be partially due to the difference in the way @xmath82 is measured in simulations and in observations .",
    "for example , the yellow line that shows a dip at @xmath126 kpc corresponds to the off - centered cooling at the beginning of the second cycle .",
    "observationally , this off - centered low entropy blob could be identified as the x - ray center and thus change the spherically - averaged @xmath82 .    as is shown in section  [ sec : results_2 ] ,",
    "star formation is closely linked to icm cooling , which can be characterized with the cooling time , @xmath82 .",
    "observations confirm that they are indeed correlated : @xmath122 luminosity @xmath127 tends to be higher in systems with lower central entropy or smaller minimum @xmath81 ratio ; it is often undetected if the icm is hotter than some threshold ( e.g. @xmath128 or @xmath129 ) @xcite .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : halpha ] the relation between the minimum @xmath81 ratio and the estimated @xmath127 in our simulation . to obtain @xmath127 from star forming regions",
    ", we adopt the commonly used linear relationship : @xmath127(ergs s@xmath105 ) = @xmath130 sfr  ( m@xmath27  yr@xmath131 @xcite . besides photoionization",
    ", some @xmath122 emission may also result from collisional ionization and the central agn . for simplicity ,",
    "we only calculate the emission from collisional ionization through interpolation of a table generated with cloudy 13.00 @xcite assuming coronal equilibrium .",
    "this gives an upper limit because we are double - counting the photoionized regions .",
    "the contribution from collisional ionization is shown as the vertical bars and is much lower than photoionization most of the time ( smaller than the size of the circles ) .",
    "our system generally occupies the same area on the @xmath127-min@xmath132 plot as the observed cool - core clusters with detected @xmath122 emission ( data from * ? ? ?",
    "there appear to be more observed systems with relatively low @xmath127 ( @xmath133 erg s@xmath105 ) and high min@xmath132 ( @xmath134 ) than our simulation for a number of reasons .",
    "first , min@xmath132 is measured with narrower radius bins in our simulations than most observations , which tends to give a smaller value .",
    "second , we do not include mergers in our simulations , which could trigger precipitation when min@xmath132 is higher ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "third , we only simulate one system based on perseus , a relatively massive cluster .",
    "it is possible that the area with low @xmath127 ( @xmath133 erg s@xmath105 ) will be more populated if we add more simulation data with systems of various different sizes .",
    "lastly , the star formation rate is likely too high in our simulations , which is a common issue in numerical simulations that only include thermal feedback from sne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a more realistic sne feedback model with kinetic feedback ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or including other physical processes such as cosmic rays @xcite and magnetic fields @xcite would likely suppress star formation and lower the sfr .",
    "the peak of the @xmath122 luminosity ( @xmath136 erg s@xmath105 ) in our simulation appears to exceed all the observed data in figure  [ fig : halpha ] , partly due to the reasons discussed above , and partly due to the incompleteness of the @xmath122 sample .",
    "if we compare the sfr in the simulation with the sfr observed in the infrared ( ir ) , we find that the two cover roughly the same range ( figure  [ fig : sfr_hist ] ) .",
    "the range of the sfr in our idealized simulation is also comparable to that found at late times in a cosmological simulation in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : halpha ] also shows that there is no linear anti - correlation between @xmath127 and the minimum ratio , as one might naively expect .",
    "this is because star formation rate is correlated with the amount of cold gas , but not the rate at which gas is cooling ( which is correlated with @xmath81 ratio ) . within each cycle",
    ", there is a significant delay up to 1 - 2 gyr between when the icm cooling rate is suppressed ( characterized as the increase of the @xmath81 ratio ) due to agn heating and when sfr starts to decline at the end of the cycle due to the consumption of the cold gas . as a result of this hysteresis",
    ", there is no linear relation between sfr and the cooling rate ( or the @xmath81 ratio ) , but they are related in that star formation only occurs when the @xmath81 ratio is below some critical value .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfr_coldgas ] shows the relationship between sfr and the total amount of cold dense gas ( with @xmath137 k and number density above 10 @xmath138 ) . a tight correlation spanning a few orders of magnitude",
    "is maintained over the course of the simulation .",
    "the slope is generally consistent with what has been found between the sfr and the inferred @xmath139 mass for bcgs @xcite , and for star forming galaxies when comparing sfr and the amount of dense molecular gas @xcite .",
    "a more detailed comparison with the observations can further constrain the star formation efficiency @xmath52 used in our model .",
    "we leave this to future work .    unlike sfr",
    ", observations have failed to find a clear correlation between the radio power of the agn and the cooling properties of the icm @xcite or the amount of cold gas in the system @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the radio power does not correlate with the actual mechanical power of the agn , but even if it does @xcite , our simulation shows that a clear correlation would be surprising simply due to the large fluctuations in the instantaneous agn power : as figure  [ fig:5in1 ] and [ fig : mdot_all ] show , the history of the sfr is rather smooth within each cycle , but the agn power varies on very short timescales ( @xmath140 10 myr , the sampling time interval ) , because the accretion region is very small and the flow of the cold gas is not smooth .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : sfr_smbh ] shows the sfr plotted against the instantaneous @xmath33 , and no correlation can be observed .",
    "however , the average agn power does correlate with icm cooling and star formation as discussed in section  [ sec : results_2 ] .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : sfr_smbh ] shows the relation between sfr and the average @xmath33 ( calculated by smoothing @xmath33 with a 200 myr moving window , corresponding to the black line in the third panel of figure  [ fig:5in1 ] ) . the solid black line is the best linear fit :    @xmath141    with both sfr and @xmath142 measured in @xmath143 .",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) error is 55 .",
    "when averaged with a shorter moving window of 50 myr , the rms increases to 70",
    ".    we also over - plot the best - fit line on the left panel for guidance , where the data shows large scatter and appears to be distributed widely , except for the lower right corner of the panel .",
    "this suggests that although @xmath33 varies a lot with time , objects with very high @xmath33 and very low sfr should be very rare .",
    "significant agn variability on short timescales has been used to explain the lack of a strong correlation between agn activity and star formation in galaxies , as one would expect from the @xmath144 relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our simulation confirms that even though the star formation rate does not appear to correlate with the instantaneous @xmath33 , a strong relationship does exist between sfr and the average @xmath33 .",
    "if we assume that the smbh growth rate is @xmath145 of @xmath33 , then the ratio of the mass added to the smbh to that added to stars is approximately @xmath146 , consistent with the observed @xmath144 relation @xcite .",
    "one important piece of physics not included in our simulations is thermal conduction .",
    "conduction can be a very efficient heating mechanism @xcite , but it is generally found that conduction fails to stem cooling in the innermost @xmath67 20 kpc @xcite , or it may be sufficient to balance cooling in some systems but not others with denser cores ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we plan to explore the effect of thermal conduction numerically in the context of agn feedback in future work . here",
    "we only qualitatively study its importance and try to address the question : does agn feedback ever boost the core entropy to such a level that conduction can take over and turn a cool - core cluster into a non cool - core cluster @xcite ?    assuming the icm is in hydrostatic equilibrium with a given gravitational potential , one can derive a family of quasi - steady solutions where radiative cooling is perfectly balanced by thermal conduction at every radius @xcite . if a cluster has an entropy profile above this solution , conduction will make the core isothermal ; if it is below the solution , conduction will fail to balance cooling and a cooling flow would develop in the absence of other heating sources @xcite . the dashed line in figure  [ fig : mark_time ]",
    "shows a conductively balanced solution for a 30% spitzer conductivity @xcite with the inner boundary conditions : @xmath147    our cluster spends most of the time below the conductively balanced solution .",
    "we caution that this solution does depend on the choice of the boundary conditions , and varying ( @xmath148 , @xmath149 ) within a reasonable range can shift the solution up and down by @xmath45 .",
    "still , given how briefly the cluster profile approaches or exceeds the conductively balanced line , it is unlikely that thermal conduction would have enough time to transform the cluster core .",
    "therefore , our simulation suggests that even with the help of conduction , agn feedback seems unable to boost a core - core cluster to a non cool - core cluster .",
    "however , thermal conduction may reduce the amount of cold gas , and thus lower the star formation rate .",
    "on the other hand , the transition layer surrounding cold clumps may become wider due to conduction , resulting in an increase in the @xmath122 luminosity .",
    "in addition , thermal conduction may help distribute the heat from the agn jets more evenly , and it is almost certainly important in heating the outer parts of the cluster core ( @xmath150 kpc ) . without conduction , by the end of our simulation , there is noticeable cooling around @xmath151 kpc ( figure  [ fig : rainbow ] ) : the temperature has decreased and the density has increased .",
    "this is also shown in figure  [ fig : heating ] : the separation between the energy loss rate due to cooling within 100 kpc and 300 kpc increases with time . even though cooling is roughly balanced by agn heating globally , without conduction",
    "the inner core gets slightly overheated ( the average cooling rate within 100 kpc declines ) while the outer core is still under heated ( cooling within 300 kpc grows ) .",
    "this may also be why each burst of precipitation / agn feedback is stronger than the previous one .",
    "we have already discussed the possible impact of mergers on the distribution of minimum @xmath81 ratio in section  [ sec : discussion_1 ] .",
    "merger - induced dynamical heating may have similar effects as conduction in heating the outer part of the cluster core around @xmath151 kpc , and thus reduced the burden on the agn .",
    "another piece of physics missing in our simulations is magnetic fields .",
    "even though with star formation we no longer see a massive cold disk that lasts indefinitely , our cluster still harbors a ( still fairly massive ) disk roughly half of the time in the simulation . this is higher than what observations seem to suggest @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields may support the cold filaments against gravity @xcite and delay the formation of a disk , and thus reduce the time the cluster spends in the disk phase .",
    "magnetic fields and cosmic rays can also provide pressure support , particularly in the condensed gas .",
    "figures  [ fig:5in1 ] and  [ fig : mdot_all ] show that gas condensation at the beginning of each cycle always happens in a catastrophic way where the amount of cold gas surges up drastically . since the growth of individual cold clumps is mainly driven by the pressure difference ( the cold clumps are typically under - pressured ) , including magnetic fields and cosmic rays in the simulation may slow down the growth and result in less bursty cooling and agn feedback .",
    "in addition , both magnetic fields and cosmic rays could suppress star formation @xcite .",
    "we again leave this to future work .",
    "we have performed three - dimensional amr simulations of an idealized , isolated cool - core galaxy cluster based on perseus , focusing on the interplay between icm cooling , agn feedback and star formation over 6.5 gyr .",
    "the momentum - driven agn feedback is modeled with a pair of jets precessing at a small angle .",
    "the jets are powered by the accretion of cold gas in the close vicinity of the smbh in the center of the cluster potential .",
    "we also include radiative cooling , self - gravity of the gas , star formation and stellar feedback in the form of thermal energy .",
    "we perform parallel simulations to tease apart the roles individual physical processes play , and compare our simulations with the observations .",
    "the key results of this work are summarized below .    1 .   the radiative cooling of the icm , agn feedback and star formation are tightly linked in cool - core clusters .",
    "momentum - driven agn jets trigger the low entropy gas to condense out of the icm .",
    "some of the condensed gas is accreted onto the smbh to power the agn jets , but much of it forms stars .",
    "while agn heating elevates the entropy of the icm in the cluster center , lengthening the cooling time , star formation and stellar feedback gradually consume and erode the cold gas ( typically over 1 - 2 gyr ) .",
    "when the cold gas vanishes , agn feedback briefly turns off and allows the icm to cool again , until gas with a short cooling time starts to precipitate , which triggers the next agn outburst .",
    "even though agn feedback is the primary heat source for the icm , star formation and stellar feedback are more effective in depleting the cold gas , thus regulating the long - term agn cycles .",
    "the range of star formation rate and the minimum @xmath81 ratio in the simulation generally agree remarkably well with the observations .",
    "our cluster does occasionally show a higher star formation rate and a lower @xmath81 ratio than observations indicate  this slight discrepancy could be related to many factors : mergers and cosmological infall , more effective stellar feedback , as well as the other physical processes not included in our simulations , such as conduction and magnetic fields .",
    "3 .   the instantaneous smbh accretion rate in the simulations shows large variations on short timescales ( @xmath140 10 myr ) .",
    "this explains why a clear correlation is not observed between the agn radio power and star formation rate or the cooling properties of the icm .",
    "nevertheless , smbh accretion and star formation are still related to each other , because both are directly linked to cooling .",
    "the star formation rate is tightly correlated with the smbh accretion rate when the accretion rate is averaged over @xmath67 200 myr .",
    "star formation is proportional to the total amount of cold gas , not the rate at which the icm is cooling .",
    "the icm responds to agn heating very quickly , but the decline of the star formation rate occurs over a much longer period of time . as a result , even though star formation only happens when the minimum @xmath81 ratio of the icm is lower than some threshold ( @xmath121 in our simulations ) , there is no linear correlation between the two .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of precipitating cool - core clusters .",
    "the main results of this paper ( the cyclical behavior of the cluster , the distribution of the minimum @xmath81 ratio , the general range of star formation rates , etc ) are fairly robust when we exclude stellar feedback , or the self - gravity of the gas , or if star formation parameters are changed .",
    "though these changes do have an effect on the strength and duration of individual cycles , the ratio between sfr and the smbh accretion rate , and the exact distribution of sfr .",
    "due to its self - regulating nature , smbh feedback can balance cooling with a wide range of feedback efficiencies , from 0.1% to 1% in numerical simulations without star formation .",
    "when star formation is included , however , even though a thermal balance is still achieved with a low feedback efficiency of 0.1% , the star formation rate is unrealistically high and the system has too much cold gas for too long .",
    "therefore , in the absence of other physics , a low smbh feedback efficiency of 0.1% can be ruled out . 7 .",
    "agn feedback balances icm cooling in a dynamical way : during major agn outbursts at the beginning of every cycle , there is more heating than cooling ; as the cooling rate decreases and star formation consumes the fuel , heating yields to cooling until the beginning of the next cycle . heating and cooling",
    "are balanced in an average sense , and a cool - core appearance is maintained despite the fluctuation .",
    "our analysis shows that even with the help of thermal conduction , it is unlikely that agn outbursts can make a cool - core isothermal . however , conduction may heat the outer parts of the cool - core at radii of roughly 100 kpc , where agn heating becomes less effective .    our numerical model including both momentum - driven agn feedback and star formation not only solves the `` cooling flow problem '' but also reproduces the behavior of cool - core clusters that are largely consistent with observations .",
    "we do not claim , however , that we have found the best parameter set .",
    "future work with a more systematic parameter study and a more extensive comparison with the observations can put better constraints on our model .",
    "a more sophisticated setup that includes mergers , conduction , and magnetic fields may also bring the model even closer to reality .",
