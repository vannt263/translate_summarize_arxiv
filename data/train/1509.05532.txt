    "a charged reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black hole emits not only the hawking radiation of all species of particles due to the horizon but also the schwinger emission of charged particles due to the electric field near the horizon , and thus provides an arena where one may explore the intertwinement between quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) and quantum aspect of black holes .",
    "the pair production by a uniform electric field in an ( a)ds space also exhibits the interplay between qed and quantum gravity effect . as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , vacuum fluctuations produce pairs from the vacuum and the horizon of a black hole or ds space and the electric field physically separate pairs .",
    "the black hole radiation has a thermal distribution with the hawking temperature as a unruh temperature with the surface gravity on the horizon.@xcite cai and kim show that the schwinger effect in the ( a)ds space has also a thermal interpretation with a unruh temperature of accelerating charges in that space.@xcite using the geometry @xmath0 near the horizon of a near - extremal black hole , chen et al have explicitly found the schwinger effect from the charged black hole.@xcite     is @xmath1.@xcite , width=288 ]    in this paper , after briefly reviewing the recently introduced contour integral method,@xcite we apply it to the pair production by a uniform electric field in the global @xmath2 geometry .",
    "then , using the near - horizon geometry @xmath0 of a near - extremal black hole , we find the schwinger effect from the charged black hole and propose a thermal interpretation of the charge emission.@xcite in the in - in formalism , the quantum field theory is extended to the complex plane of time or space and the out - vacuum transported along a loop starting from the past infinity is distinguished from the in - vacuum by simple poles of the frequency or momentum in the background spacetime and/or electromagnetic field.@xcite hence , particle production is characterized and determined by polons , that is , contour integrals of all homotopy classes of winding number one encircling poles.@xcite differently from the planar coordinates without any finite pole , a massive scalar field in the global coordinates has simple poles both at the north and south pole of the global geometry , whose contributions interfere and result in the stokes phenomenon of the ds radiation depending on the spacetime dimension.@xcite it is investigated whether the schwinger effect may have such a stokes phenomenon in the global @xmath3 geometry .",
    "the holographic schwinger effect is also studied in the ds space@xcite and ads space.@xcite",
    "in the functional schrdinger picture and the in - in formalism , the in - vacuum in the past infinity evolves to the future infinity and return to the past infinity , which gives the mean number of pairs@xcite @xmath4 here , the quantum evolution is extended to the complex plane and @xmath5 denotes distinct contours of winding number one .",
    "for instance , the global ds geometry has simple poles not only at infinity but also at the north and south poles , which contribute constructively or destructively depending on whether the spacetime dimension is even or odd.@xcite on the other hand , the planar ds space has the simple pole at infinity only and has a nondestructive radiation with the gibbons - hawking temperature .",
    "a physical reasoning may be that the propagator and hence the hyugens principle exhibits a different nature . in the in - in formalism",
    ", the scattering matrix between the in - vacuum and another in - vacua tranported along contours @xmath6 of all winding numbers gives the vacuum persistence @xmath7 where the upper ( lower ) sign is for scalar ( spinor ) qed and the mean number @xmath8 is determined by the contours of winding number one in eq .",

    "the production of charged pairs by a uniform electric field in a ds space exhibits both the schwinger effect and the gibbons - hawking radiation as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1].@xcite an ads space confines virtual pairs and limits the schwinger pair production through the breitenlohner - friedman bound.@xcite now , we consider the schwinger effect in the two - dimensional global ds geometry @xmath9 and in the uniform electric field with a vector potential @xmath10 .",
    "we distinguish the weak - field limit ( @xmath11 ) from the strong - field limit ( @xmath12 ) , in which the pair production has different characteristics .",
    "first , we consider the weak - field limit ( @xmath13 below ) .",
    "following ref .  , a charged scalar has the time - dependent frequency @xmath14 where @xmath15 the frequency ( [ freq ] ) has two poles at @xmath16 corresponding to the north and south pole of the global geometry , which lead to the so - called stokes phenomenon of ds radiation.@xcite as will be shown below , the schwinger effect has also the stokes phenomenon in the weak - field limit .",
    "let us introduce a conformal transformation @xmath17 and restrict to a single riemann sheet .",
