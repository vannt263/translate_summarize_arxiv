    "quantum plasmas , where the finite width of the electron wave functions gives rise to collective effects @xcite , are currently a rapidly growing field of research . many of the studies are motivated by the potential for application to nanoscale systems @xcite , such as quantum wells @xcite , ultracold plasmas @xcite , laser fusion plasmas @xcite , next - generation high intensity light sources @xcite , and plasmonic devices @xcite .",
    "moreover , nonlinear effects in quantum plasmas , such as the formation of dark solitons and vortices @xcite , interaction between quantum plasma oscillations and electromagnetic waves @xcite , quantum turbulence @xcite , and solitary structures @xcite supported by the electron spin @xcite , are currently in focus as well .",
    "there has also been much interest in shocks in quantum - like systems , such as nonlinear optical fibers and bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "the structure of such quantum shocks is markedly different from the classical ones @xcite .",
    "the shock structure in classical fluids / gases is governed by transport processes , _",
    "i.e. _ , the viscosity and thermal conduction .",
    "a classical shock propagating with constant velocity displays a stationary structure .",
    "if the shock is weak , then transition from initial matter to compressed one may be described by the smooth monotonic burgers solution @xcite .",
    "in contrast to classical fluids , quantum media typically exhibit dispersion due to the bohm potential instead of dissipation @xcite . for this reason",
    ", even a quantum shock propagating with constant velocity in a uniform medium does not posses a stationary structure .",
    "transition from initial to compressed quantum media happens in the form of a train of solitons of different amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the solitons propagate with different velocities , which makes the whole structure intrinsically non - stationary .",
    "obviously , a train of solitons also provides a non - monotonic transition from initial to final state of the medium . however , there are quantum systems with both dissipations and dispersion , such as quantum plasmas",
    ". the viscosity in plasma is determined by ions and it is typically negligible . still , electron thermal conduction may be quite strong both in classical and quantum plasmas @xcite .",
    "therefore , shocks in such plasmas may demonstrate transitional behavior between the classical and quantum domains .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to trace such a transition by studying weak shocks .    here , we derive a nonlinear equation governing the structure of a weak shock in quantum plasma .",
    "the equation contains both dissipation terms ( due to thermal conduction ) and dispersive quantum terms ( due to the bohm potential ) . unlike quantum systems without dissipation ,",
    "even relatively weak thermal conduction may lead to a stationary structure of a shock . in the limit of zero quantum effects",
    "we recover the monotonic burgers solution for the shock structure .",
    "still , even small quantum terms make the transition non - monotonic with the shock driving a train of oscillations into the initial plasma .",
    "the oscillations propagate together with the shock with the same velocity .",
    "the oscillations become stronger as the role of bohm potential increases in comparison with thermal conduction .",
    "the oscillations resemble the soliton train in quantum shocks without dissipations .",
    "the basic equation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is the schrdinger equation .",
    "the dynamics of an electron , represented by its wave function @xmath0 , in an external electromagnetic field @xmath1 is governed by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is planck s constant , @xmath4 is the electron mass , and @xmath5 is the magnitude of the electron charge . this complex equation may be written as two real equations , writing @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the amplitude and @xmath8 the phase of the wave function , respectively @xcite .",
    "such a decomposition was presented by de broglie and bohm in order to understand the dynamics of the electron wave packet in terms of classical variables . in ref .",
    "@xcite the wigner function was employed for the purpose of obtaining a set of quantum hydrodynamic equations . in this way",
    ", an arbitrary number of conservation equations , in particular an energy conservation equation , may be obtained before closure . here",
    "we will just briefly review the bohm  de broglie approach , making use of the energy conservation equation from ref .",
    "@xcite . using the decomposition of the wave function in terms of its amplitude and phase , eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrodinger ] ) gives @xmath9 and @xmath10 where the velocity is defined by @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : schrod - mom ] ) is the gradient of the bohm  de broglie potential , and is due to the effect of wave function dispersion .",
    "we also note the striking resemblance of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : schrod - cont ] ) and ( [ eq : schrod - mom ] ) to the classical fluid equations",
    ".    suppose that we have @xmath14 electron wavefunctions , independent apart from their interaction via the electromagnetic field .",
    "for each wave function @xmath15 , we have a corresponding probability @xmath16 . from this , we first define @xmath17 and follow the steps leading to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : schrod - cont ] ) and ( [ eq : schrod - mom ] ) .",
    "we now have @xmath14 such equations the wave functions @xmath18 . defining @xmath19 and @xmath20 we can define the deviation from the mean flow according to @xmath21 taking the average , as defined by ( [ eq : meanvelocity ] ) , of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : schrod - cont ] ) and ( [ eq : schrod - mom ] ) and using the above variables , we obtain the quantum fluid equation @xmath22 and @xmath23 where we have assumed that the average produces an isotropic pressure @xmath24 we note that the above equations still contain an explicit sum over the electron wave functions . for typical scale lengths larger than the fermi wavelength @xmath25",
    ", we may approximate the last term by the bohm  de broglie potential @xcite @xmath26 where the factor @xmath27 comes from an isotropic averaging .    treating the ions as fully classical due to their large inertia",
    ", we can derive a a set of single - fluid quantum magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations , following @xcite where a similar set of equations for a perfect fluid type quantum mhd system was derived .",

    "the energy conservation equation ( [ eq.3 ] ) is derived using the wigner approach @xcite for the electron dynamics and combining this with the ion equation in the mhd limit .",
    "here we have neglected the effects due to the magnetic field , that are assumed small in comparison to the other governing terms .",
    "such terms can easily be included @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations should be complemented by the thermodynamic equation of state .",
    "we take the equation of state to be that of an ideal gas , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath37 and @xmath38 and let the electron thermal conduction @xmath35 be @xmath39 . here @xmath40 is heat capacity at constant pressure and @xmath41 is the adiabatic exponent .",
    "we stress that the forms ( [ eq.4 ] ) and ( [ eq.5 ] ) play a minor role for weak shocks .",
    "we consider a planar stationary shock . in the reference frame of the shock , eqs .",
    "( [ eq.1])([eq.3 ] ) may be integrated as @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 where the subscript 0 refers to the uniform plasma ahead of the shock and @xmath45 is the shock speed .",
    "as we can see from ( [ eq.7])([eq.9 ] ) , quantum effects do not influence the properties of the uniform flow behind the shock ; they are important only for the shock structure .",
    "next , we introduce the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 and the scaled variables @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 . here",
    "@xmath51 is the characteristic length scale determined by thermal conduction ; in the classical case it may be treated as the shock width with the accuracy of a numerical factor of order unity .",
    "the other parameter is the mach number , @xmath52 , which compares the shock velocity @xmath45 to the initial sound speed @xmath53 in the plasma and characterizes the shock strength .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 denotes the deviation of the temperature , produced by the shock wave , from the initial value . in the case of weak shocks",
    "we have @xmath55 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the shock velocity marginally exceeds the sound speed , and as does the temperature from the initial value @xmath56 . using the scaled variables , we reduce eqs .",
    "( [ eq.7])([eq.9 ] ) to @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the parameter comparing the role of quantum and classical effects in the shock dynamics .",
    "this parameter can be interpreted as a quantum mach number .",
    "the system ( [ eq.23])([eq.24 ] ) determines the structure of a shock wave in a quantum plasma . in the classical case we have @xmath60 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq.23 ] ) gives an algebraic relation between the density and temperature @xmath61.\\ ] ] the positive sign in ( [ eq.23a ] ) gives rise to shock solutions , while the negative sign corresponds to deflagrations @xcite .",
    "we note that the density and temperature of the compressed matter increase together in a shock . in deflagrations",
    ", the temperature increase leads to a decrease of the density , as in , _",
    "e.g. _ , laser ablation and flames @xcite . substituting ( [ eq.23a ] ) into ( [ eq.24 ] )",
    ", we obtain a single differential equation for the temperature in a classical shock . in the case of strong quantum shocks",
    ", one has to solve a system of two differential equations .      in the present paper",
    "we investigate only the case of a weak shock with @xmath62 and @xmath56 .",
    "a more general case will be studied elsewhere .",
    "as note above , this value of @xmath63 characterizes a shock velocity marginally above the sound speed . in the case of a weak shock in the linear approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq.23a ] ) may be simplified according to @xmath64 taking into account the quantum dispersion and the weak nonlinearity in ( [ eq.23 ] ) , we find @xmath65 equation ( [ eq.26 ] ) relates the density to the temperature in a weak shock .",
    "taking into account the linear approximation ( [ eq.26a ] ) , we may simplify the quantum dispersive term as @xmath66 substituting ( [ eq.26 ] ) into ( [ eq.24 ] ) , we find @xmath67 equation ( [ eq.27 ] ) describes the structure of a weak shock in a quantum plasma with finite thermal conduction .",
    "dissipation and quantum terms enter eq .",
    "( [ eq.27 ] ) as the first and second derivatives of the scaled temperature .",
    "all derivatives tend to zero in the uniform flows corresponding to the initial and final plasma states at @xmath68 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath69 in the initial flow , we find the relation between scaled temperature increase in the shock wave and the scaled shock speed @xmath70 thus , we can rewrite ( [ eq.27 ] ) as @xmath71 the solution to ( [ eq.28 ] ) changes from @xmath69 at @xmath72 in the initial plasma ahead of the shock to @xmath73 at @xmath74 in the compressed plasma behind the shock .",
    "we are interested in solution to ( [ eq.28 ] ) for any parameter value @xmath75 from @xmath76 ( classical plasma ) to infinity ( quantum plasma without dissipations ) . to simplify our study of eq .",
    "( [ eq.28 ] ) , we may rescale the temperature according to @xmath77 , so that @xmath78 changes from @xmath76 in the initial plasma to @xmath79 in the compressed plasma .",
    "we also rescale the coordinate @xmath80 and introduce a new parameter @xmath81 then ( [ eq.28 ] ) reduces to a concise form @xmath82 the parameter @xmath83 describes the relative role of quantum effects and thermal conduction in the shock . equation ( [ eq.29 ] ) is the main result of our paper .    in the case of zero quantum effects ( @xmath84 ) ,",
    "( [ eq.29 ] ) goes over to the stationary burgers equation with the solution @xmath85 the influence of quantum effects may be analyzed analytically in the limit of small @xmath86 . because of the invariance to a shift in space , the solution to ( [ eq.29 ] ) may be presented the form @xmath87 so that @xmath88 to @xmath89 order in @xmath83 @xmath90 we have @xmath91 , and to @xmath92 order in @xmath83 , eq . ( [ eq.29 ] ) becomes @xmath93 the classical solution ( [ eq.30 ] ) was symmetric in space with respect to the central point @xmath94 . as we can see from ( [ eq.32 ] )",
    ", quantum effects make the scaled temperature slope @xmath95 steeper in the front part of the shock , for @xmath96 , and smoother at the back side , for @xmath97 .",
    "we can also solve ( [ eq.29 ] ) analytically in the limit of strong quantum effects , @xmath98 . in that case the leading terms in ( [ eq.29 ] ) are @xmath99 integrating ( [ eq.33 ] ) once , we obtain @xmath100 where @xmath101 due to the boundary condition at the back side of the shock ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq.34 ] ) may be also rewritten as @xmath103 and integrated to give @xmath104 the solution ( [ eq.35 ] ) is a dark soliton of korteweg  de vries type ( similar solutions have previously been found in quantum hydrodynamics @xcite ) .",
    "the solution ( [ eq.35 ] ) is characterized by a new length scale @xmath105 ; and it tends to unity , @xmath102 , for @xmath106 .",
    "we note that neglecting dissipation , we can not come from initial state @xmath107 to the final state @xmath108 smoothly .",
    "therefore , the shock inevitably contains a weak discontinuity , which is a surface where @xmath78 is continuous but @xmath95 has a discontinuity .",
    "this weak discontinuity develops at the front side of the shock where @xmath109 and @xmath110 the temperature profile may reach the point where @xmath109 either from the `` bright '' or `` dark '' side , depending on the positive and negative sign , respectively , in eq . ( [ eq.35a ] ) .",

    "the weak discontinuity may be removed taking into account a small but finite dissipation . in the limit of strong quantum effects and weak dissipation",

    "therefore , even for a small but non - zero quantum effects we should expect oscillations ahead of the shock .",
