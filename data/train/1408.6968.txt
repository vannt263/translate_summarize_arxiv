    "these lecture notes provide an introduction to the theory of _ sato - tate groups _ associated to abelian varieties , with an emphasis on abelian surfaces ( especially the jacobians of hyperelliptic genus 2 curves ) .",
    "lecture 1 consists of an introduction to the sato - tate conjecture , including some detailed discussion of equidistribution in compact lie groups . in the manner of @xcite ( which we recommend highly as a gentle introduction for anyone encountering this circle of ideas for the first time ) , we use the chebotarev density theorem as a motivating analogy .",
    "lecture 2 consists of a detailed description of serre s generalization of the sato - tate conjecture to an arbitrary abelian variety @xcite , as further explicated in @xcite and @xcite in terms of the construction of a _",
    "sato - tate group _ using hodge theory and @xmath0-adic tate modules .",
    "we also give a sketch of serre s reduction of the generalized sato - tate conjecture to some analytic properties of @xmath1-functions ( * ? ? ? * chapter  1 , appendix ) and an indication of how this reduction is used in some known cases of the conjecture ( including the original sato - tate conjecture over @xmath2 ) .",
    "lecture 3 is a survey of the classification of sato - tate groups associated to abelian surfaces , due to fit , rotger , sutherland , and the author @xcite , including some explicit discussion about the connected parts and component groups which arise .",
    "we end with some speculation about generalizations .",
    "in this lecture , we recall the statement of the sato - tate conjecture ( now a theorem ! ) for elliptic curves , then reformulate it in a fashion which is more suggestive of generalizations .",
    "we start with hasse s theorem on the number of points on an elliptic curve over a finite field .",
    "( see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  v.1.1 ) ) .",
    "let @xmath3 be an elliptic curve over a finite field @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath5    for example , let @xmath3 be the projective curve defined by the affine weierstrass equation @xmath6 then @xmath3 is an elliptic curve provided that the discriminant @xmath7 is nonzero .",
    "( for @xmath8 a power of a prime @xmath9 , every elliptic curve over @xmath4 can be put in this form ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  3 ) . ) in this case , the set @xmath10 contains exactly one point at infinity ( namely the point @xmath11 $ ] ) , so the number of solutions of the equation @xmath12 is @xmath13 .",
    "hasse s theorem may then be interpreted as follows .",
    "for an individual value of @xmath14 , the number of square roots of @xmath15 can be either 0 or 2 , each with probability about 1/2 ( there is also a small chance of the number being 1 , which we neglect ) .",
    "if the counts were truly independent random variables for distinct values of @xmath16 , the central limit theorem would assert that @xmath17 where @xmath18 is with high probability less than a constant multiple of @xmath19 .",
    "hasse s theorem says that this in fact occurs not just with high probability , but with absolute certainty !",
    "it is natural to ask how the quantity @xmath18 varies within the interval @xmath20 $ ] for a fixed @xmath8 .",
    "although this is not the question we will be pursuing later , it provides an opportunity to introduce some key ideas in a somewhat simpler setting , so the detour will be worthwhile .    to simplify matters ,",
    "let us assume @xmath21 is a prime and also that @xmath9 , so that we can describe all elliptic curves using weierstrass equations .",
    ", one should work over the set of isomorphism class of elliptic curves modulo @xmath22 , where each class carries the weight @xmath23 for @xmath24 equal to the number of automorphisms of an elliptic curve in the class .",
    "this type of weighting is consistent with the burnside - cauchy - frobenius counting lemma for orbits of group actions .",
    "] let us view @xmath25 as a random variable over the set of pairs @xmath26 for which @xmath27 , and then ask questions about the distribution of this random variable . as usual in probability theory , it is useful to study the _ moments _ @xmath28 of @xmath25 ( where @xmath29 denotes the expected value , i.e. , the average over the sample space ) .",
    "note that @xmath30 whenever @xmath31 is odd , because each elliptic curve can be paired with its quadratic twist to obtain complete cancellation .",
    "the even moments of @xmath25 were studied by birch @xcite . for small @xmath31 ( and @xmath9 )",
    ", birch obtains explicit formulas , which we have subtracted out here .",
    "moreover , serre points out that the formulas in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2 ) are all missing a factor of @xmath32 . ] which are polynomials in @xmath22 .",
    "we have @xmath33    for larger @xmath31 , similar formulas always exist ( by the selberg trace formula ) but will not be polynomials in @xmath22 ; there are additional contributions coming from the coefficients of certain modular forms .",
    "birch provides one explicit example .",
    "let @xmath34 denote ramanujan s @xmath34-function , so that @xmath35 then @xmath36    even when exact formulas for the moments prove to be complicated , it is also useful to give asymptotic formulas ; this will give information about the limiting distribution of @xmath25 as @xmath37 ( more on this below ) . in this vein , birch shows the following .",
    "we have @xmath38    note that @xmath39 is an integer , namely the @xmath31-th catalan number .",
    "it is worth noting that this sort of geometric averaging can be generalized rather substantially ; see @xcite .",
    "we now turn to our primary question of interest .",
    "let us now take @xmath3 to be a fixed elliptic curve is a curve of genus 1 equipped with the choice of a @xmath40-rational point .",
    "for a general curve of genus 1 , the existence of a rational point is automatic when @xmath40 is a finite field but not when @xmath40 is a number field ; in the latter case , though , the jacobian construction produces a true elliptic curve with the same zeta functions .",
    "consequently , there is no real gain in generality by considering the sato - tate conjecture for genus 1 curves over @xmath40 . ] over a number field @xmath40 .",
    "for @xmath41 a prime ideal of @xmath40 , we write @xmath8 for the absolute norm of @xmath40 and @xmath4 for the residue field of @xmath41 .",
    "we will only be interested in primes at which @xmath41 has _ good reduction _",
    ", so that one may reduce modulo @xmath41 to get an elliptic curve @xmath42 over @xmath4 .",
    "( this excludes only finitely many primes ; for instance , if @xmath3 is given by a weierstrass equation , then each prime ideal not dividing @xmath43 is a prime of good reduction . )    we again write @xmath44 in the form @xmath45 .",
    "( we write @xmath46 instead of @xmath18 because there are in general several prime ideals of the same norm , which will have different point counts . )",
    "since @xmath46 now ranges over an interval of varying length , it is natural to renormalize it by defining the new quantity @xmath47.\\ ] ] one can then ask about the distribution of @xmath48 as @xmath41 varies `` randomly , '' but it is tricky to define probability measures on infinite sets . instead , we should consider all the prime ideals with @xmath49 as a probability space with the uniform distribution , then `` take the limit as @xmath50 . ''",
    "this last step still needs some precision , but as a start we can make histogram plots for various values of @xmath51 , then view the animated picture given by varying @xmath51 . for some examples of such a visualization ,",
    "see    http://math.mit.edu/~drew/g1satotatedistributions.html    two more precise constructions are the following .",
    "* for each positive integer @xmath31 , consider the moment @xmath52 over the set of primes up to @xmath51 as a function of @xmath51 , then take the limit as @xmath50 to get a sequence of `` limiting moments '' @xmath53 . *",
    "produce a measure @xmath54 on the interval @xmath55 $ ] with the following _ equidistribution property _ : for any continuous function @xmath56 \\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] , we have as shorthand for running over the prime ideals @xmath41 of @xmath40 of norm at most @xmath51",
    ". since there are only finitely many primes of bad reduction , we may define @xmath48 for them arbitrarily without changing the limit . ]",
    "@xmath57 this can be imagined as a `` time average equals space average '' property in the spirit of ergodic theory .",
    "these points of view are equivalent in the following sense : under some technical hypotheses which we omit ( but are mild enough not to be a a concern in our applications ) , the existence of the limiting moments implies equidistribution for some @xmath58 and vice versa , and moreover @xmath59 that is , the @xmath31-th limiting moment is in fact the @xmath31-th moment of the limiting measure .",
    "using either point of view , if one experiments with various elliptic curves over @xmath40 , one observes exactly three possible limiting behaviors .",
    "the key distinguishing feature here is complex multiplication : the endomorphism ring of @xmath3 , viewed as an algebraic group over @xmath60 ( or a complex torus ) , is either the trivial ring @xmath61 ( which is present for any commutative algebraic group ) or an order in an imaginary quadratic field @xmath62 . in the latter case , we say that @xmath3 has _ complex multiplication in @xmath62_.    we start with the case of complex multiplication in a subfield of @xmath40 . in this case , everything may be deduced easily from hecke s description of the @xmath46 in terms of grossencharacters .",
    "see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  1 ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 has complex multiplication in @xmath62 and that @xmath63 .",
    "then the limiting moments exist and satisfy @xmath64 and equidistribution occurs for the continuous measure defined by the function @xmath65 ( which is not bounded at the endpoints , but the improper integral converges ) .",
    "when the complex multiplication occurs in a field not contained in @xmath40 ( as for instance is always the case when @xmath66 ) , one gets a similar but slightly different statement , with essentially the same proof .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 has complex multiplication in @xmath62 and that @xmath67 .",
    "then the limiting moments exist and satisfy @xmath68 and equidistribution occurs for the average of the continuous measure defined by @xmath65 with a dirac point measure concentrated at @xmath69 .",
    "the presence of the dirac component , and the fact that it contributes half of the total measure , can be explained by the fact that in this setting @xmath70 exactly when @xmath41 is a prime which remains inert in the compositum @xmath71 .",
    "we now turn to the case where @xmath3 does not have complex multiplication , which is a certain sense is the most typical : a `` randomly chosen '' elliptic curve does not have complex multiplication .",
    "in this case , numerical evidence ( first collected by sato for @xmath66 ) and theoretical considerations ( first raised by tate , later expanded by serre ; see below ) lead to the following conjecture .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 does not have complex multiplication .",
    "then the limiting moments exist and satisfy @xmath72 and equidistribution occurs for the continuous measure defined by the function @xmath73    note the recurrence of the catalan numbers ; this means that the limiting distribution in this case coincides with the limiting distribution computed by birch , in which one first considers all possible elliptic curves over @xmath74 for a fixed prime @xmath22 , then takes the limit as @xmath37 .",
    "the great difficulty with this conjecture is that one does not have a description of the @xmath18 as simple as that given by hecke in the case of complex multiplication . in the case @xmath66",
    ", one does at least have the _ modularity of elliptic curves _ ( proved by wiles in the case of everywhere semistable reduction @xcite and breuil  conrad  diamond  taylor in general @xcite ) , which asserts that the @xmath25 arise as fourier coefficients of a certain modular form .",
    "although this by itself is not enough to establish the conjecture , with a great deal of additional work ( more on which below ) one can prove the following .",
    "the sato - tate conjecture holds whenever the field @xmath40 is totally real .      in order to generalize the sato - tate conjecture to other abelian varieties , especially the jacobians of genus 2 curves",
    ", we will need to take an alternate point of view .",
    "this point of view also happens to provide an indication of how to approach the proof of equidistribution .",
    "we begin by recalling another equidistribution property in number theory : the chebotarev density theorem .",
    "let @xmath75 be an irreducible ( nonconstant ) polynomial of degree @xmath76 over a number field @xmath40 .",
    "for each prime ideal @xmath41 of @xmath40 aside from finitely many exceptions , the reduction of @xmath77 mod @xmath41 will still have degree @xmath76 and will factor into distinct irreducible subfactors .",
    "if we read off the degrees of these factors , we obtain an unordered partition @xmath78 of @xmath76 .",
    "let @xmath1 be the splitting field of @xmath75 over @xmath40 , put @xmath79 , and consider the permutation action of @xmath80 on the roots of @xmath77 in @xmath1 .",
    "for each unordered partition @xmath81 of @xmath76 , let @xmath82 be the probability that a random element of @xmath80 acts with cycle structure @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath83    to see how this follows from the usual chebotarev theorem , we may first view cycle structure as a function on @xmath80 which factors through the quotient @xmath84 to the space of conjugacy classes of @xmath80 . let us equip @xmath80 with the uniform measure and @xmath85 with the _ uniform measure _",
    ", so that for any function @xmath86 we have @xmath87 in concrete terms , each class in @xmath85 is weighted proportionally to its cardinality .    for each prime ideal @xmath41 of @xmath40 with finitely many exceptions ( namely the primes that ramify in the splitting field of @xmath77 )",
    ", we may define a _",
    "frobenius class _ @xmath88 using artin s construction : for any prime ideal @xmath89 of @xmath1 lying over @xmath41 , there is a unique element @xmath90 stabilizing @xmath89 and satisfying @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the conjugacy class of @xmath93 .",
    "we then have the usual statement of the density theorem .    the elements @xmath92 are equidistributed in @xmath85 for the image of the uniform measure on @xmath80 .",
    "we say nothing about the proof except to point out that it can be interpreted as an example of serre s equidistribution formalism , for which see the end of the second lecture .      in the previous discussion , we resolved a problem about the distribution of factorizations of reductions of a fixed polynomial modulo a varying prime by `` lifting '' this problem to a problem about the distribution of a sequence of conjugacy classes within a finite group .",
    "we now make a first attempt to perform such a lifting for the problem of equidistribution of the values of @xmath48 arising from an elliptic curve over @xmath40 .",
    "this attempt will remain somewhat incomplete until we give a formal definition of sato - tate groups in the second lecture .",
    "the condition that @xmath94 $ ] is equivalent to asserting that the polynomial @xmath95 has roots which are complex conjugates and lie on the unit circle .",
    "it is also equivalent to asserting that @xmath96 is the characteristic polynomial of some matrix in the lie group @xmath97 of unitary matrices with determinant 1 .",
    "recall that explicitly , @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the conjugate transpose of @xmath100 . in this case , the matrices in @xmath97 with characteristic polynomial @xmath96 form a unique conjugacy class ; that is , we may identify @xmath101 with @xmath55 $ ] via the trace map .",
    "recall that any compact topological group admits a unique translation - invariant measure called the _ haar measure _ ; in particular , for a finite group with the discrete topology it is simply the uniform measure .",
    "it is easily checked that under the previous identification , the measure on @xmath55 $ ] corresponds to the image measure on @xmath101 arising from the haar measure on @xmath97 . by analogy with chebotarev",
    ", we now see that the sato - tate conjecture is equivalent to the equidistribution in @xmath101 of the conjugacy classes with traces @xmath102 !",
    "what about the cases of complex multiplication ? in the case",
    "where @xmath63 , the limiting measure can be interpreted as the image via the trace map of the haar measure not on @xmath97 , but rather on the subgroup @xmath103 of rotations .",
    "in the case where @xmath67 , one instead gets the image of the haar measure on the normalizer of @xmath103 in @xmath97 , which is no longer a connected group : it has two connected components , one consisting of @xmath103 itself , and the other on which the trace is identically zero .",
    "this suggests that we should be able to naturally `` lift '' the equidistribution problems in these two cases to problems about the equidistribution of certain conjugacy classes in these two groups ; we will see how to do this in the second lecture .",
    "in this lecture , we describe a generalization of the sato - tate conjecture to arbitrary abelian varieties .",
    "the key point is to identify a compact lie group and a sequence of conjugacy classes corresponding to the prime ideals over the base field , and then the conjecture simply becomes the equidistribution property .",
    "we also include some discussion of a proof strategy for the sato - tate conjecture and the extent to which it succeeds .      in order to even ask the correct question in the case of abelian varieties",
    ", we must first recall weil s definition of , and results about , the zeta function of an abelian variety over a finite field .",
    "see for example @xcite for a complete presentation .    for @xmath104 a variety over a finite field @xmath4 , the _ zeta function _ of @xmath104 is the complex - analytic function defined in a suitable right half - plane by the absolutely convergent product @xmath105 where @xmath16 runs over the closed points of @xmath104 ( equivalently , the galois orbits of @xmath106-points ) and @xmath107 denotes the degree of @xmath16 ( i.e. , the cardinality of a galois orbit ) .",
    "it is often more useful to compute @xmath108 via the identity @xmath109 of formal power series in @xmath110 .",
    "the general properties of @xmath108 were established via the collective efforts of dwork , grothendieck , deligne , et al . during the 1960 s .",
    "however , we will only be interested in two special cases established by weil himself somewhat earlier ( which provided motivation for the more general results ) .    [",
    "t : weil1 ] let @xmath111 be a ( smooth , projective , geometrically connected ) curve over @xmath4 of genus @xmath93",

    "* the complex zeroes of @xmath125 lie on the line @xmath126 .",
    "thus weil s theorem provides a bridge between hasse s theorem and the riemann hypothesis .",

    "thanks to , @xmath131      the analogue of the sato - tate conjecture for an abelian variety over a number field will involve the distribution of not just the number of points , but the full zeta function of the reduction modulo various prime ideals . of course , in order to make reasonable conjectures , one needs to have access to numerical data ; although the collection of such data is not the subject of this lecture series , at least a few remarks are in order .",

    "the computation of the @xmath134 is a finite computation in principle ( at least assuming @xmath100 is given in a sufficiently explicit manner ) , but often quite infeasible in practice .    in the spirit of this conference ,",
    "let us then restrict attention to the case where @xmath100 is the jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve @xmath111 . in this case , a much more practical suite of algorithms can be obtained using @xmath22-adic analytic techniques .",

    "this algorithm was originally optimized for finite fields of small characteristic ; it was modified to work better in larger characteristics by harvey @xcite .",
    "more recently , harvey @xcite discovered a new optimization specific to the case of interest in this paper , where one starts with a hyperelliptic curve over @xmath2 and considers its reductions modulo all primes up to some bound .",

    "note that this class respects the weil pairing , so it defines a symplectic automorphism of @xmath186 .",
    "it remains to move this @xmath0-adic construction over to @xmath118 to obtain a class in @xmath169 ; for this , some trickery is unavoidable .",
    "we start by choosing an algebraic ( but in no way continuous ) embedding of the field @xmath187 into @xmath118 .",
    "this allows to map @xmath188 to a conjugacy class in @xmath189 ; we may then semisimplify and then divide by the scalar @xmath19 to obtain a new class @xmath190 .",
    "this gives a conjugacy class in a maximal compact subgroup of the zariski closure of @xmath169 ( called the _",
    "algebraic sato - tate group _ in @xcite ) ; using properties of maximal compact subgroups of a reductive algebraic group over @xmath118 we obtain a well - defined class @xmath92 in @xmath169 itself .",

    "as stated , this conjecture includes the _ mumford - tate conjecture _ that the image of @xmath174 on @xmath192 is of finite index in the largest possible subgroup consistent with geometric constraints .",
    "this weaker conjecture is substantially easier than the generalized sato - tate conjecture ; for instance , for elliptic curves it was proved by serre @xcite in an even stronger form ( considering the action on all of the @xmath193 at once to obtain a comparison of adelic groups ) long before any progress was made on the sato - tate conjecture .",
    "however , while this weaker conjecture is known in many more cases than the generalized sato - tate conjecture , it is open in the most general case .      in the case",
    "@xmath123 , we were able to use moments to distinguish among distributions of @xmath48 .",
    "for general @xmath93 , we are looking at a @xmath93-dimensional space of polynomials , so we can not hope to distinguish these using statistics based on a single function .",
    "write @xmath194 one can reconstruct the entire joint distribution of @xmath195 from the _ joint moments _ @xmath196 but not from the moments of the @xmath197 individually .",
    "that being said , if one already has a classification in hand and one needs only to distinguish the distributions at hand ( e.g. , if one is seeking to match an abelian surface against the classification of @xcite based on numerical data ) , many fewer moments are needed .",
    "it may also be useful to consider additional data ; for instance , the group - theoretic distributions we will encounter always split as sums of discrete measures and continuous measures , and one may wish to keep track of the discrete components separately : in principle these are determined by the moment sequence , but one may need some high moments for this and these are difficult to compute numerically .",
    "we now have many examples of problems of the following form : given a compact lie group @xmath80 and a sequence @xmath92 of elements of @xmath85 , prove that this sequence is equidistributed for the image of haar measure .",
    "it turns out that such problems can be solved using a general argument analogous to dirichlet s proof of the uniform distribution of primes across residue classes ( and with the proofs of the prime number theorem by hadamard and de la valle poussin ) .",
    "this argument was probably part of tate s motivation for making the sato - tate conjecture , but was first written out explicitly by serre ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  i , appendix ) .    for each finite - dimensional linear representation @xmath198 of @xmath80 , define a function @xmath199 on the complex half - plane @xmath200 via the absolutely convergent product @xmath201 where @xmath202 represents any lift of @xmath88 ( this choice does not affect the definition ) .",
    "for @xmath198 the trivial representation , @xmath199 is essentially the dedekind zeta function of @xmath40 ( modulo the omission of finitely many factors ) , and so it has meromorphic continuation to @xmath118 with a simple pole at @xmath203 . using standard representation theory for compact lie groups ( especially the peter - weyl theorem ) , serre checks the following .",
    "suppose that for each each nontrivial irreducible representation @xmath198 , the function @xmath199 admits an analytic continuation to a neighborhood of the point @xmath203 which is ( holomorphic and ) nonzero at @xmath203 .",
    "then the elements @xmath92 are equidistributed in @xmath85 for the image of the haar measure on @xmath80 .    as an aside",
    ", we note that when @xmath198 is not irreducible , @xmath199 has a pole at @xmath203 of order equal to the multiplicity of the trivial representation in @xmath198 .",
    "this fact can be used to give a representation - theoretic computation of some moment sequences , such as for the trace in a fixed representation .",
    "( in particular , this explains why the moment sequences we have seen previously consist of nonnegative integers . )",
    "let us briefly discuss how this formalism applies in the cases we have mentioned previously .",
    "* for the chebotarev density theorem , we may check serre s criterion using the known analytic properties of dirichlet @xmath1-functions ( plus class field theory to guarantee that this accounts for all @xmath1-functions associated to abelian galois groups ) and artin s theorem on induced characters . * for elliptic curves with complex multiplication",
    ", we may check serre s criterion ( modulo the exact definition of the equidistribution problem , for which see the second lecture ) using hecke s description of the @xmath46 in terms of grossencharacters , whose @xmath1-functions are well understood by analogy with the classical theory of the riemann zeta function . * for elliptic curves without complex multiplication ,",
    "the best strategy currently known for checking serre s criterion is to use potential modularity results of taylor @xcite for the galois representations associated to the irreducible representations of @xmath97 , namely the symmetric powers of the tate module .",
    "these results represent a significant advance over the original modularity theorem for elliptic curves , which could only handle the first symmetric power . for @xmath66 , this strategy",
    "was executed by harris ",
    "shepherd - barron  taylor and clozel  harris  taylor @xcite ; for @xmath40 totally real , it has been carried out by barnet - lamb  geraghty ",
    "gee @xcite . * for abelian varieties of dimension @xmath204",
    ", it appears unlikely that current technology will suffice to prove the generalized sato - tate conjecture in any cases without extra structure .",
    "however , one can still hope to treat cases with sufficient extra structure .",
    "for example , for abelian varieties with complex multiplication , one can again use hecke s arguments ; this has been worked out explicitly by johansson @xcite .",
    "one can also extend the methods used for elliptic curves to certain classes of abelian surfaces ; see again @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that in the presence of more detailed information about the zeroes and poles of @xmath205 , one can improve the equidistribution statement by controlling the error term .",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "in this lecture , we specialize to the case of abelian surfaces and describe the classification of sato - tate groups of abelian surfaces given in @xcite .",
    "this can be viewed as giving an explicit form to the generalized sato - tate conjecture ( theorem  [ t : genst ] ) in the case @xmath206 ; however , using the preceding definition of the sato - tate group , the classification theorem is in fact unconditional .        throughout this lecture ,",
    "let @xmath100 be an abelian surface over a number field @xmath40 .",
    "one may wish to keep in mind the case of the jacobian of a genus 2 ( necessarily hyperelliptic ) curve @xmath111 over @xmath40 , but most of our work will be on @xmath100 rather than @xmath111 .        up to conjugation within @xmath207 , there are exactly @xmath208 groups that occur as the connected parts of sato - tate groups of abelian surfaces over number fields : @xmath209 moreover , all @xmath208 groups occur for abelian surfaces over @xmath2 .    to see that all of these options occur , let @xmath210 be nonisogenous elliptic curves over @xmath40 with complex multiplication ; let @xmath211 be nonisogenous elliptic curves over @xmath40 without complex multiplication ; and let @xmath100 be an abelian surface such that @xmath166 has trivial endomorphism ring .",
    "( for an explicit example of @xmath100 , we may take the jacobian of the curve @xmath212 , as originally shown by zarhin @xcite . )",
    "then the connected parts of the sato - tate groups of the abelian surfaces @xmath213 are exactly the ones listed in the theorem . however",
    ", it is also possible to realize all of the connected parts using absolutely simple abelian varieties ; we will explain this later in the lecture .",

    "the proof of the classification theorem of @xcite consists of three main parts .",
    "the first part @xcite is a purely group - theoretical classification of subgroups @xmath80 of @xmath207 ( up to conjugation ) satisfying certain conditions imposed by hodge theory ( called the _ sato - tate axioms _ in @xcite ) .    1 .",
    "the group @xmath80 is a closed subgroup of @xmath207 .",
    "2 .   there exists a homomorphism @xmath227 such that @xmath228 has eigenvalues @xmath229 and does not factor through any closed proper normal subgroup of @xmath161 .",
    "3 .   for each component @xmath230 of @xmath80 and each irreducible character @xmath231 of @xmath232 , the average ( for haar measure ) of @xmath233 over @xmath230 is an integer .",
    "this yields a preliminary list of 55 groups which are eligible to occur as sato - tate groups .",
    "the second part of the proof is a matching argument using the enumeration of galois types in @xcite ; this fails to realize 3 of the groups in the original classification , yielding the list of 52 groups .",
    "the third part of the group is an enumeration of some genus 2 curves which provably realize all 52 groups @xcite .",
    "let us now take @xmath111 to be a genus 2 curve over @xmath40 , and suppose that we can compute the polynomials @xmath138 for many prime ideals @xmath41 ( this is indeed practical , as discussed at the end of the second lecture ) .",
    "if we write @xmath141 in the form @xmath234 then we can compute ( approximations of ) the limiting moments of both @xmath235 and @xmath236 , and according to the generalized sato - tate conjecture these should equal the corresponding averages over the sato - tate groups .",
    "these moment sequences are tabulated in @xcite and can be used to distinguish all 52 possible groups .",
    "in fact , in many case much less data is necessary ; for instance , the group @xmath207 is the only one for which @xmath237 , the other groups all yielding larger values .    in some cases",
    ", it is more useful to supplement the computation of moments with the additional computation of the densities of special values . for @xmath235",
    ", only the value 0 can occur with positive density ; for @xmath236 , the values @xmath238 can occur with positive density .",
    "these densities are also tabulated in @xcite .",
    "it must be pointed out here that this presentation of @xcite inverts the order of discovery ! the classification began with this kind of numerical investigation ; a partial numerical census was made in @xcite , but this turned out not to be exhaustive for ( at least ) two reasons : only the distribution of @xmath235 was considered , which conflates certain distinct sato - tate groups ; and the search was not exhaustive enough to detect some of the rarest cases .",
    "the most obvious next step would be to consider abelian threefolds .",
    "this is now feasible thanks to @xcite , but looks to be a daunting task for two reasons . on one hand",
    ", there is a combinatorial explosion in the number of possible cases , especially when the connected part is as small as possible ( i.e. , cases of complex multiplication ) . it is likely that the final number of sato - tate groups ( up to conjugation ) will number in the hundreds or thousands . on the other hand , the rarest of these cases may be extremely difficult to detect using a brute - force search , so some intricate analysis is likely to be required to rule them in or out .",
    "it is instead probably more profitable to consider higher - dimensional varieties which have relatively small pieces of cohomology which can be isolated .",
    "an example of this can be found in @xcite , where a partial classification is made of motives of weight 3 whose hodge numbers coincide with the symmetric cube of an elliptic curve .",
