    "vast areas of our planet have arid environments where non  living matter predominates .",
    "the rare vegetation allows at many places the existence of highly mobile sand dunes which move in wind direction up to several decades of meters per year .",
    "for instance , in morocco at the latitude of the canarian islands sand is shifted by wind from the beaches hundreds of kilometers into the continent ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : morocco ] ) . the unidirectional wind regimes and not too high sand coverage lead to the formation of isolated sand dunes called barchans .",
    "they move mostly uncorrelated with velocities proportional to their reciprocal height  @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic instability of barchan dunes under an incoming sand flux leads to an increase of the largest dunes in the field whereas the smaller ones shrink until they disappear  @xcite .",
    "hence , the mean size of the dunes should grow with the distance from the beginning of a field .",
    "nevertheless , in many dune fields the sizes saturate .",
    "two mechanisms have been proposed to avoid unlimited dune growth : instability of large dunes due to changing wind directions  @xcite and collisions between dunes  @xcite .        here",
    ", we concentrate on the case when a dune collides with another one . due to the size dependence of their velocities ,",
    "the dune that collides onto another one from behind must be smaller .",
    "this process has been observed several times  @xcite but was not understood until recently .",
    "the large temporal scales of such a process makes it difficult to observe the final state after such a collision .",
    "simulations were carried out to understand what happens if two dunes collide with each other and different results were obtained depending on the relative height difference between the interacting dunes  @xcite .",
    "the three different final situations of coalescence , solitary wave behavior and breeding provide mechanisms to redistribute the dune sizes and thus to avoid continuous growth of the dunes in a dune field . here , we present simulations of dune collisions with lateral shift in order to extract a general rule for the resulting volumes and positions .",
    "these new rules are implemented into a model for the evolution of a simplified dune field where dunes only collide with each other . from this model",
    "we find that collisions as a mechanism of redistribution of sand capable to select a characteristic dune size .",
    "in fact , dune sizes in such a scenario follow a gaussian distribution .",
    "this section presents the results of the dune model that takes into account the calculation of the turbulent wind field , the sand flux and the height changes on the surface .",
    "the dune model considers the height profile of sand dunes in a unidirectional wind field and calculates its impact on the air flow and the sand flux over a dune .",
    "the dune shape can change and so produce an alteration of the atmospheric boundary layer until eventually a final shape forms .",
    "the model is explained in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite . here , we focus exclusively on the quantitative results by considering the dunes as entities without regarding their particular shapes .    in the following",
    ", the dune sizes will be expressed by their width @xmath0 in order to be able to compare the results of the dune model in a better way to the results of the simulations described in the next sections .",
    "the linear relations between dune height , width , length and the cubic one between width and volume are assumed to follow the laws observed in measurements  @xcite and computational models  @xcite .",
    "simulations of the dune model are carried out to obtain the outcome of collisions between two dunes for different initial lateral offsets @xmath1 and volume ratios @xmath2 keeping the volume of the larger barchan constant at 6000 m@xmath3 .",
    "open boundary conditions are used with an influx equal to the outflux of the larger dune .",
    "we define the relative lateral offset between two dunes as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the coordinates of the center of mass of the large and the small dune in the lateral direction transverse to their movement , respectively .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the width of the larger dune . besides",
    ", the volume ratio is defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the volume of the large barchan and @xmath10 the one of the small one .",
    "[ fig : coll ] illustrates different temporal stages of the collision process for different offsets and one relative size @xmath11 . in general , we distinguish between three final states after a collision : coalescence where only one dune remains , solitary wave behavior where the number of dunes remains two after the collision ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coll ] d , e ) and breeding where one small dunes leave the horns of the larger one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coll ] a , b , c ) . a similar picture ,",
    "although less rich , was obtained by @xcite . as can be observed in the figures , in the case of breeding only a very small dune leaves the horn .",
    "this dune generally is not stable .",
    "hence , we will neglect the very small dune in breeding and consider the output of a collision as consisting only on two dunes , a small one that leaves the hybrid state and a large one that remains behind .",
    "therefore , breeding will be equivalent to solitary wave behavior in the following .",
    "the redistribution of the total volume after a collision process is described by the volume ratio @xmath12 after the collision .",
    "this volume ratio can approximately be expressed by the phenomenological equation , @xmath13 valid for @xmath14 .",
    "this condition takes into account that there is a minimal relative size @xmath15between the incoming dunes below which coalescence occurs @xcite .",
    "this coalescence threshold is function of the relative initial dune offset @xmath1 , and is given by , @xmath16    on the other hand , the term @xmath17 represents the sensitivity of the final volume ratio @xmath12 to the initial offset @xmath1 , @xmath18    fig .",
    "[ fig : volratio ] illustrates the shape of @xmath19 compared to the measurements ( dots ) obtained from the simulations with dune .",
    "we analyzed simulations with different offsets @xmath1 for seven different values of @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coll ] shows the simulation results for @xmath11 ) .    additionally , the lateral positions of both dunes change after the collision .",
    "no simple rule could be found and thus we do not consider the final offset .",
    "after the collision as a function of the initial offset @xmath1 and the initial volume ratio @xmath2 due to eq .",
    "( [ eq : r_f ] ) .",
    "dots show the measured values obtained from the simulations . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "in order to illustrate the dune size instability let us discuss the flux balance equation .",
    "the flux balance of a dune is given by the difference between the net sand influx @xmath20 and outflux @xmath21 . since both scale with @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the undisturbed saturated sand flux on a plane , the mass conservation states @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the dune influx and outflux per unit length , respectively .",
    "the simulations of single barchans with a constant influx using the dune model , show that the dune outflux scales linearly with the influx with a correction for small dune sizes which depends on the inverse of the square of the dune width ( fig .",
    "[ fig : inoutflux ] ) , @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are parameter fits to the data set .",
    "the deviation from the scale invariance in the dune outflux @xmath26 for small dune sizes is expressed by the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : q_inout ] ) .",
    "however , since the critical width @xmath30 is of the order of the minimal dune width , the nonlinear term is very small and can be neglected .",
    "therefore , we consider dune shapes as scale invariant . in this case , the mass balance becomes @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the equilibrium influx at which the dune volume does not change .",
    "however , this equilibrium is unstable since there is no mechanism by which barchan dunes can change their outflux to adjust it to a given influx .",
    "this instability is remains after including the correction term for small dunes .    .",
    "for small widths @xmath33 the outflux deviates from the fit ( solid line ) which means that the dune has become a dome . for higher width however",
    ", the outflux relax as @xmath34 to a constant value -solid line .",
    "inset : the dune outflux is a linear function of the dune influx -solid line- with a slope smaller than unity -dashed line .",
    "there are two different regimes , for @xmath35 the outflux is higher than the influx and the dune shrinks , while for @xmath36 the influx is larger than the outflux and the dune grows.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in general the flux balance on a dune is not in equilibrium .",
    "however , assuming that the flux inside the field is homogeneous due to diffusion , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vol_diff ] ) with an influx @xmath37 leads to the ideal state at which the volumes of all dunes in the field remain constant . under this approximation",
    ", we consider a simplified model for a dune field that only includes binary collisions .",
    "the system consists of a large number of dunes , characterized only by their width , which interact exclusively through collisions between them .",
    "we study the evolution of the dune size distribution @xmath38 in the field in order to check if the macroscopic behavior of the system approaches an absorbing state .",
    "we use two kinds of initializations for the system . in the first the size of the initial dunes ( their width )",
    "is randomly chosen with an uniform distribution between 0 and some value @xmath39 .",
    "the second one generates dunes with sizes differing only slightly from some previously chosen width @xmath40 ( uniform distribution with width two around @xmath40 ) .",
    "the initial number of dunes is 1000 in our simulations . during a simulation very small dunes",
    "are removed from the dune field . in order to simulate an entire dune field",
    ", we consider annealed interactions among the dunes which means that a new mutual lateral distance ( offset ) is tossed before each collision .    for each collision",
    "two dunes are randomly chosen from the field to collide .",
    "this is repeated every iteration as many times as there are dunes in the field .",
    "if the second dune is larger than the first one , no interaction takes place .",
    "no new dunes are generated but the ones with size @xmath41 are removed .",
    "the outcome of a collision between the larger dune ( upper case variables ) and the smaller one ( lower case variables ) is , for simplicity , assumed to depend only on the relative mutual lateral distance , the random offset @xmath1 and the volume ratio @xmath42 .",
    "the new volume ratio , @xmath12 , is cast , according to the measurements presented above , through eq .",
    "( [ eq : r_f ] ) , and the conservation of the total volume of the two dunes , @xmath43 . as already mentioned above , eq .",
    "( [ eq : r_f ] ) includes only solitary wave behavior .",
    "we neglect here the creation of new small dunes by breeding .",
    "we choose the offset between the two dunes to be a random number distributed uniformly in the interval @xmath44 $ ] at each collision .",
    "the limit of the maximum offset of @xmath45 is due to the fact that the size of dunes colliding with an offset larger than the distance to the horns of the larger one generally is not altered .",
    "the histograms in fig .",
    "[ fig : sizedistr ] show that the dunes form gaussian  like distributions which peak around some width @xmath46 .",
    "the results of the model depend on the shape of the initial size distribution of the field .",
    "the total mass of all dunes is conserved with the exception of a negligible amount due to small dunes removed from the field .",
    "the average volume represents the crucial and only value to determine the absorbing state of the simulations independent from the initial distribution of sizes .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : sizedistr ] shows a reciprocal cubic increase of @xmath46 versus the average volume of the field .",
    "the distributions also become broader for larger @xmath46 as can be observed in both figures .",
    "we can calculate the root mean square deviation in the corresponding histograms .",
    "this deviation follows the same simple law as @xmath46 versus the average volume .",
    "the analysis of collisions of barchan dunes with lateral offset showed that some regularity exists in the resulting sizes after the collisions .",
    "some simple laws could be formulated to fit the outcome of such an interaction between two dunes .",
    "the resulting volumes can be understood to depend only on the initial offset and volume ratio .",
    "we applied these phenomenological rules to a simple model which considers the effects of collisions in a dune field without considering the sand flux between them .",
    "the distribution shows a gaussian  like shape with respect to the one  dimensional extensions of the dunes .",
    "the cubic relation between volume and width of a dune implies that the volume is not gaussian  distributed as could have been expected .",
    "we demonstrated that dune collisions could play a crucial role for stabilizing the size distribution of a barchan dune field as already mentioned by ref .",
    "the simple model presented here certainly does not resemble real dune behavior .",
    "especially the neglection of sand flux and the absence of a dependence of the dune interaction on spatial dune coordinates hinders us from providing a complete picture of a dune field .",
