    "one of the best studied examples of these very luminous supergiants is the yellow hypergiant @xmath6  cas ( f2@xmath8 g @xmath7 ) . this evolved star exhibits stable pulsation ( quasi- ) periods of 300@xmath8500  d.    although the @xmath9- and @xmath10-mechanisms have been identified as the main cause for driving pulsations of the less luminous high - gravity atmospheres of cepheids , little is known about the efficiency of these effects for the much more extended and tenuous atmospheres of cool massive supergiants . in detailed calculations of the first generalized adiabatic index @xmath0 , @xcite ( paper i ) found that this quantity assumes very small values , below 4/3 , in low - gravity model atmospheres with 5000  k @xmath11 @xmath3 @xmath11 8000  k , primarily due to the partial thermal ionization of hydrogen .",
    "@xcite recently suggested that enhanced mass - loss due to ionization - induced dynamical instability of the outer envelope of luminous supergiants which evolve redwards , would terminate their redward movement , and provide an explanation for an observational lack of yellow and red supergiants with log(@xmath12/@xmath13)@xmath146.0 .",
    "however , the major problem for evaluating supergiant dynamic ( in)stability , based on detailed calculations of @xmath0 , is the breakdown of lte conditions in these very extended atmospheres .",
    "the importance of nlte ionization- and excitation - conditions is evident from modeling the spectra of these stars , which are formed in conditions of very small gravity acceleration .",
    "the local ionization equilibrium is strongly determined by the stellar radiation field , which determines important thermodynamic quantities such as the heat capacities , and the related mechanic compressibility of these atmospheres .    in this paper",
    "we develop , for the first time , a self - consistent thermodynamic formalism which accounts for departures from lte for the calculation of @xmath0 .",
    "this goal is accomplished by introducing the temperature of the radiation field as an independent state variable which can differ from the local kinetic gas temperature .",
    "we discuss in sect .",
    "2 the departure from thermal ionization equilibrium by an incident and diluted stellar radiation field in the eddington approximation . section 3 provides a historical overview of the development of the theory of the adiabatic indices .",
    "the complete analytical expressions for the computation of @xmath0 and the heat capacities in mixtures of monatomic gas , interacting with radiation are given in sect .",
    "we account for departures from lte conditions due to the interaction of matter and radiation , by evaluating the thermodynamic quantities accordingly .",

    "we apply our calculations to a new ( kurucz ) grid of cool supergiant model atmospheres , which we compute down into the stellar envelope .",
    "we will demonstrate that nlte - ionization of hydrogen strongly enhances the destabilization of supergiant atmospheres with 6500  k @xmath11 @xmath3 @xmath11 7500  k. for models towards smaller gravity acceleration the stability integral decreases , and the destabilizing regions occur at lower densities over a larger geometric fraction of the atmosphere .",

    "in the atmospheres of supergiants the ionization balance of tenuous gas is not solely determined by a collisional equilibrium according the saha - equation .",
    "significant departures from thermal ( equilibrium ) ionization occur due to photo - ionization by an incident radiation field .",
    "the local ionization state then becomes dependent of both kinetic gas temperature , and the temperature of the radiation field .",
    "for example , stellar uv radiation strongly influences the balmer continuum in hot stars . in deeper atmospheric layers , where the atmosphere is sufficiently optically thick for all wavelengths , both temperatures thermalize , and the equilibrium radiation field assumes an intensity distribution determined by the local kinetic gas temperature . in the upper layers the radiation field dilutes with distance from a point in the atmosphere where the gas becomes sufficiently optically thin , and the radiation temperature decouples from the local thermodynamic conditions .",
    "a comprehensive description of partially ionized systems which deviate from equilibrium , due to a radiation field of temperature @xmath1 , not in equilibrium with the electron maxwell distribution of temperature @xmath15 , is given in @xcite .",
    "all particle components ( neutrals , ions and electrons ) are assumed to be in a maxwell distribution . for the calculation of ionization fractions",
    ", this statistical theory assumes that the detailed balance between collisional and/or radiative ionization , and recombination processes applies .",
    "it enables to express the ionization fractions through a departure coefficient @xmath16 from the saha equilibrium ( also the ` nlte saha - equation ' ) , which can be evaluated using a reduced form of the collision ionization cross - section and , for the photo - ionization coefficient , a diluted planck distribution with a cross - section obtained from quantum - mechanical calculations .",

    "the departures from lte become very large in low density , optically thin , regions . because of the radial variation of the local temperature and the wavelength variation of the opacity sources , the emitted spectrum departs from a blackbody at any particular temperature .",

    "these conditions are typical for the atmospheres of cool supergiants .",
    "figure 1 reveals that @xmath0 acquires minimum values for @xmath1 between 7000  k and 9000  k , primarily due to the partial ionization of hydrogen . towards very low @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath0 approaches the value of 5/3 for monatomic ideal gas , whereas for high @xmath1 @xmath0 assumes the equilibrium radiation value of 4/3 .",
    "the intermediate regions with lowest @xmath0 correspond to @xmath105@xmath20.5 .",
    "the nlte - ionization equation causes a strong dependence of the local mean ionization fraction on the value of @xmath1 . for a given radiation temperature ,",
    "however at constant gas pressure , the ionization fraction _ decreases _ towards higher kinetic gas temperatures , because the nlte - ionization fraction remains dependent of the local kinetic temperature through the factor @xmath199 in eq .",

    "we find minimum values for @xmath0 which can decrease to below 0.7 for very small gas pressures and low @xmath15 .",
    "the minima gradually increase for larger gas pressures , by shifting towards higher @xmath1 .",
    "this is also shown by the @xmath0-surface plots of fig .  2 .",
    "the deep minimum around @xmath1@xmath28000  k ( _ lower panel _ ) becomes shallower and broadens for increased kinetic pressures ( _ upper panel _ ) .",
    "the relative decrease of the radiation pressure also enhances the partial ionization of he , which is visible for @xmath1 between 14,000  k and 16,000  k. note that we have also included the partial ionization of @xmath201 in our calculations .",
    "its ionization can be treated as a separate ` element ' , because the ionization energy is very high , and partial ionization occurs around 25,000  k for @xmath202=1  dyn  @xmath198 .",
    "electrons from less abundant metal atoms , with smaller ionization energies , contribute only slightly to the total electron pressure .",
    "the much larger abundance of hydrogen ( by about a factor of ten larger than he ) causes the large decrease of @xmath0 to occur for @xmath1 between 7000  k and 9000  k , for the small gas pressure conditions of supergiant atmospheres .",
    "an important influence on the local mean ionization fraction is the dilution of radiation pressure with distance above @xmath35 , which we further discuss in sect .",
    "calculations with @xmath203@xmath41/2 ( for @xmath204 ) reveal that the minima of @xmath0 increase , which is expected when kinetic pressure dominates the gas state .",

    "since @xmath0 is a function of depth in the star , the integration requires geometrical depths down to the stellar center for the computation of @xmath208 . when @xmath209 the configuration is stable , because the standing wave solution of the equation of motion does not grow with time .",
    "for supergiants we can assume that the fundamental eigenfrequency @xmath210 is not affected by magnetic fields , and that rotational kinetic energy can be neglected .",
    "stellar dynamic stability depends on the volume - averaged value of @xmath0 , and vanishes when this average @xmath211 is less than 4/3 , hence @xmath212 . because our detailed knowledge of @xmath0 is limited to the atmospheric layers , it is not straightforward to infer stellar dynamic stability from eq .",
    "however , @xcite recently argued that the integral can be limited to ` an effective basis ' , or a point where @xmath4@xmath0@xmath5 becomes constant in deeper parts of the atmosphere near the base of the stellar envelope .",
    "numerical integrations of the equation of motion demonstrate that this truncation is allowed , because the radius eigenfunction @xmath213(@xmath21)/@xmath21 ( the relative pulsation amplitude ) at the base of the outer envelope is already many orders of magnitude smaller than its value at the stellar surface ( so small that it is virtually indistinguishable from zero ) .",
    "since regular stellar pulsation is caused by envelope mechanisms , this limitation of ledoux stability integral provides a useful means to test for atmospheric stability throughout the hr - diagram .",
    "note , however , that a sound analytical foundation for this numerical ` criterion ' is currently lacking , and that important thermodynamic effects due to improved descriptions of @xmath0 , as we present here , are crucial to ascertain its validity .",
    "nevertheless , atmospheric regions where ionization and radiation cause @xmath0 to locally decrease to below 4/3 are of great interest .",
    "these real gas effects also influence @xmath185 and @xmath186 in supergiants ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is well - known that the local lowering of @xmath185 causes the onset of convective motions .",
    "@xcite mentions convective ` instability'-regions in the partial ionization zones of h and he . for",

    "the temperature structure for models with spherical symmetric geometry will change significantly , and more detailed solutions of the nlte - problem ( i.e. by solving detailed rate equations ) will influence the behavior of @xmath0 . in the present application",
    "we assume that the stellar radiation field in the optically thin part of the model atmospheres ( @xmath47@xmath42/3 ) can be approximated by the stellar effective temperature for our computation of @xmath0 with height ( see sect . 8 for a discussion ) .    the upper panel of fig .",

    "the dilution of the ionizing radiation field diminishes the local value of @xmath105 , and the point where @xmath2150.5 occurs in layers of increasingly smaller optical depth .",

    "we compute that the fluid becomes fully ionized , and @xmath0 assumes constant values around 1.45 .",
    "deeper down at the base of the stellar envelope , the value of @xmath0 approaches asymptotically 4/3 , because radiation pressure outweighs the gas pressure for high temperatures above @xmath216  k.    figure 4 shows the behavior of @xmath0 in model atmospheres for 4000  k@xmath21720,000  k , with small log(@xmath214)-values .",

    "the cool boundary of the ` yellow evolutionary void ' occurs for _ bluewards _ evolving massive supergiants at @xmath3@xmath28300  k and log(@xmath12/@xmath13)@xmath55.6 .",
    "evolutionary calculations show that these stars are expected to evolve along tracks of nearly constant luminosity , below the humphreys - davidson limit .",
    "they evolve bluewards because massive stars shed copious amounts of mass to the circumstellar / interstellar environment in the red supergiant phase . during redward evolution",
    "the very high mass - loss rates reduce the stability of the convective layer , and below a critical envelope mass it contracts into a thinner radiative envelope which causes rapid blueward evolution . only for a limited range of initial masses stars",
    "become red supergiants and evolve back far bluewards .",
    "a possible candidate for such a scenario is hr 8752 , for which @xcite found an increase of the photospheric temperature by 3000 k@xmath84000 k , based on high - resolution spectra collected over the past 30 years .",
    "it is suggested that recurrent eruptions in yellow hypergiants occur when these stars approach the cool boundary of the void , and ` bounce off ' redwards .",
    "the bouncing against the void may also explain why most of the cool luminous hypergiants cluster near its low - temperature boundary , while the identification of hypergiants of later spectral type , possibly like vy  cma ( of m - type ) , is seldom .    in their analysis of atmospheric acceleration mechanisms",
    "@xcite show that stable solutions can not be computed for the atmospheres of blueward evolving yellow hypergiants at the low - temperature boundary of the void .",
    "it results from a time - independent solution of the momentum equation , which considers the newtonian gravity acceleration derived from the evolutionary mass , the gas , radiation and turbulent pressure gradients , and the momentum of the stellar wind .",
    "the latter requires the observed mass - loss rate .",
    "an ` effective acceleration ' for the atmosphere is obtained iteratively , but which becomes negative at the cool border of the void .",
    "the outwards directed net force causes an unstable atmosphere around @xmath3=8300  k. we note that their momentum equation incorporates the important compressibility effects due to thermal ionization by the decrease of @xmath0 in the adiabatic sound velocity , and of the isothermal and isochoric factors ( @xmath127 and @xmath228 ) in the gas pressure gradient .",
    "we suggest that the determination of instability boundaries for the void be further improved with the nlte - calculations of @xmath0 we present .",
    "it is important to note that in our computations the minimum of @xmath4@xmath0@xmath5 for stable models with lowest gravity acceleration occurs around @xmath3=6500  k , which does not coincide with the low - temperature border of the void .",
    "however , there is an overlap because @xmath4@xmath0@xmath5 approaches values very close to 4/3 in low - gravity models at this border .",
    "it suggests that the minima we compute for @xmath4@xmath0@xmath5 are rather linked with the driving of stable non - radial pulsation modes for the atmospheres of yellow supergiants in the extension of the cepheid instability strip , whereas the void can result from a particular combination of various acceleration mechanisms , combined with the decrease of the overall stability by the larger atmospheric compressibility due to partial nlte- and lte - ionization .",
    "the high mass - loss rates observed for these streaming atmospheres are also determined by the sonic point , which is situated inside the photospheres of cool massive supergiants .",
    "the dynamics of such extended atmospheres must therefore be linked with a prominent mechanism which drives these atmospheric pulsations , and which provides the momentum for their supersonic winds .",
    "finally , we remark that more definitive conclusions about atmospheric variability mechanisms should be obtained with fully time - dependent hydrodynamic simulations for a number of prototypic hypergiants , like @xmath6  cas .",
    "our analytical approximations are useful to evaluate important hydrodynamic quantities as the adiabatic sound speed @xmath229 in conditions of nlte , without having to numerically solve for large systems of non - linear balance equations . with this analytical work",
    "we also provide a well - founded basis for more sophisticated numerical hydrodynamic calculations .",
    "time - dependent codes which simulate the pulsation of extended atmospheres ( i.e. described by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could adequately be updated for hydrodynamic nlte effects , without the loss of their numerical efficiencies . with the present study",
    "we demonstrate that such advanced calculations can not be based on the usual assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium . in extended atmospheres , the thermodynamics of non - local equilibrium",
    "is required , and ultimately , these calculations also ought to consider non - equilibrium thermodynamic processes for realistic dynamic modeling .",
    "we present new expressions for the first generalized adiabatic index @xmath0 and the heat capacities , which are required for the study of dynamic stability of supergiant stellar atmospheres .",
    "our equations consider important nlte effects on the local ionization state by an incident and diluted radiation field , not in equilibrium with the local kinetic gas temperature .",
    "we demonstrate analytically that our more general expressions , which are also valid for multi - component gas mixtures , simplify to the classic formulae in which the radiation and kinetic temperature equilibrate .    \\2 . from a numerical application of our formalism to a grid of supergiant model atmospheres with solar abundance and 4000  k @xmath11 @xmath3 @xmath11 20,000  k , we find that the local values of @xmath0 become very small , below 4/3 , over a large fraction of the atmosphere for models with @xmath3 between 7000  k and 8000  k. this results from the incident radiation field with a temperature of the order of the stellar effective temperature , which primarily causes partial photo - ionization of hydrogen .",
    "these regions displace deeper down the atmosphere with raising @xmath3 , whereas the thermal partial ionization regions , at the base of the atmosphere , displace outwards .",
    "this combined effect causes the deep minimum in the local values of @xmath0 to occur for these cool star atmospheres . around these effective temperatures ,",
    "partial nlte - ionization causes very high atmospheric compressibilities , by which @xmath0 can even decrease to below unity .",
    "numerical evaluations of ledoux stability integral @xmath4@xmath0@xmath5 down into the stellar envelope demonstrate that @xmath4@xmath0@xmath5 exceeds 4/3 in supergiant models for which we can compute a hydrostatically stable solution . towards smaller gravity accelerations @xmath4@xmath0@xmath5 decreases , and models",
    "become unstable with @xmath4@xmath0@xmath5 @xmath4 4/3 at the base of the envelope .",
    "stable models with smaller atmospheric gravity assume smaller @xmath4@xmath0@xmath5-values , and ledoux stability integral verifies that models of higher @xmath3 destabilize at increasingly larger gravity - values due to the enhancement of radiation pressure .",
    "most importantly , our calculations reveal that for stable supergiant models with 6500  k @xmath11",
    "@xmath3 @xmath11 7500  k , @xmath4@xmath0@xmath5 assumes minimum values , below 4/3 , over a very large fraction of the atmosphere down to its base . around @xmath3=6500",
    "k this minimum occurs practically independently of the atmospheric gravity acceleration .",
    "these effective temperatures should be considered valid only within a case study for kurucz atmospheric models . for a given @xmath3 , in atmospheres of increasingly smaller gravity ,",
    "@xmath4@xmath0@xmath5 assumes small values in layers of increasingly lower density due to enhanced partial ionization with the dilution of the radiation field .",
