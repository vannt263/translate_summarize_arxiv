    "<S> we reexamine the novel phase diagrams of antiferromagnetism ( afm ) and high-@xmath0 superconductivity ( htsc ) for a disorder - free cuo@xmath1 plane based on an evaluation of local hole density ( @xmath2 ) by site - selective cu - nmr studies on multilayered copper oxides . </S>",
    "<S> multilayered systems provide us with the opportunity to research the characteristics of the disorder - free cuo@xmath1 plane . </S>",
    "<S> the site - selective nmr is the best and the only tool used to extract layer - dependent characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we have concluded that the uniform mixing of afm and sc is a general property inherent to a single cuo@xmath1 plane in an underdoped regime of htsc . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3=0 phase diagram of afm constructed here is in quantitative agreement with the theories in a strong correlation regime which is unchanged even with mobile holes . </S>",
    "<S> this  _ mott physics _ plays a vital role for mediating the cooper pairs to make @xmath0 of htsc very high . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , we address from extensive nmr studies on electron - doped iron - oxypnictides la1111 compounds that the increase in @xmath0 is not due to the development of afm spin fluctuations , but because the structural parameters , such as the bond angle @xmath4 of the feas@xmath5 tetrahedron and the a - axis length , approach each optimum value . based on these results </S>",
    "<S> , we propose that a stronger correlation in htsc than in feas - based superconductors may make @xmath0 higher significantly .    </S>",
