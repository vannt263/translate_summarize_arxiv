    "the aharonov  bohm effect @xcite and berry s phase @xcite attract much interest of theoreticians and experimentalists for a long time .",
    "the interest is due to two circumstances .",
    "firstly , the @xmath0-connection arises in a natural way in solving the schrdinger equation in both cases .",
    "secondly , there is a widely spread opinion in gauge field theory that only gauge field strength can lead to observable effects but not gauge potentials themselves which are not gauge invariant . in spite of this judgement , aharonov  bohm and berry",
    "have shown that the integral of a gauge field along a closed loop can produce observable effects .",
    "these conclusions were soon confirmed experimentally .",
    "the notion of the berry phase was shortly generalized to the non - abelian case corresponding to degenerate energy levels of a hamiltonian by wilczek and zee @xcite . in this case , non - abelian gauge fields naturally arise in solving the schrdinger equation .    in all above mentioned cases ,",
    "the observable effects are produced by elements of the holonomy groups of corresponding connections which are gauge invariant objects .",
    "there is no any disagreement at this point .",
    "however , the uniform opinion on the geometric interpretation is absent . in the paper by b.  simon @xcite and subsequent publications by other authors ,",
    "the gauge field was considered as a connection on an associated fiber bundle .",
    "since the typical fiber of an associated fiber bundle in a general case is an infinite dimensional hilbert space , specific difficulties arose .",
    "important and interesting constructions connected to characteristic classes are related to the existence of global sections of associated fiber bundles but not to the berry phase itself . there",
    "arise definite topological obstructions for the existence of global sections .",
    "hence the judgement that the berry phase and aharonov  bohm effect have its origin in topology is widely spread in literature .    in the present paper",
    ", we give another geometric interpretation of the berry phase and aharonov  bohm effect in terms of the connection theory on principal fiber bundles .",
    "there are no difficulties related to infinite dimensional manifolds in this approach because typical fibers are @xmath0 or @xmath1 groups which are finite dimensional lie groups .",
    "it is shown that the principal fiber bundle can be trivial while the connection arising on it has nontrivial holonomy group in a general case and therefore leads to observable effects . as the consequence , the berry phase and aharonov  bohm effect have the origin in geometry rather then in topology .",
    "moreover the existence of global sections on an associated fiber bundles is not a necessary condition .",
    "if a global section is absent , then the local connection forms are defined on a coordinate covering of the base of the principal fiber bundle defining the unique connection on the principal fiber bundle up to an isomorphism .",
    "the paper consists of two parts .",
    "firstly , we consider the berry phase and its generalization to the case of degenerate energy levels of a hamiltonian . in the second part , we give geometrical interpretation of aharonov ",
    "bohm effect .",
    "nontrivial geometric structures , in particular , we are talking about nontrivial connection on a principal fiber bundle , often arise in solving equations of mathematical physics . in this section ,",
    "we show how nontrivial connection on a principal fiber bundle with the structure group @xmath0 or @xmath1 appears in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics in the process of solution of the schrdinger equation . the surprise is based not on the natural appearance of the principal fiber bundle but on the experimental observation of the predicted effects .    in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , the state of a system",
    "is described by the vector of the hilbert space ( the wave function ) @xmath2 which depends on time and some set of other variables depending on the considered problem .",
    "the evolution of a quantum system in time @xmath3 is described by the schrdinger equation @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a selfadjoint operator acting in the hilbert space @xmath6 which is called hamiltonian of a system , and @xmath7 is the planck constant .    for simplicity , we put @xmath8 and denote partial derivative on time by a dot , @xmath9 , in what follows .",
    "the scalar product is given in the hilbert space which we denote by parenthesis @xmath10 by definition , the scalar product is linear in the second argument @xmath11 and the equality @xmath12 holds where the symbol @xmath13 denote complex conjugation .",
    "the square of a vector in the hilbert space @xmath14 is a real number , and we require the quadratic form @xmath14 to be strictly positive definite , i.e.  @xmath15 , and @xmath16 if and only if @xmath17",
    ". then the scalar product defines the norm of a vector in the hilbert space @xmath18 the schrdinger equation is linear in @xmath19 , and state vectors can be normalized .",
    "usually , state vectors are assumed to be normalized on unit , @xmath20 the norm of a state vector is preserved in time due to the selfadjointness of the hamiltonian .",
    "normalization of a state vector do not eliminate the arbitrariness in choosing the state vector in the hilbert space because the arbitrariness in choosing a phase factor still remains .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath13 to denote hermitian conjugation of matrices , i.e.transposition of a matrix and taking complex conjugation of all elements .",
    "in particular , when a matrix consists of one element the hermitian conjugation coincides with complex conjugation .",
    "now we describe the problem which was considered by m.  berry @xcite in its simplest form .",
    "assume for simplicity that the hilbert space is a finite dimensional complex space @xmath21 of complex dimensionality @xmath22 .",
    "then the hamiltonian is given by the hermitian @xmath23 matrix and a state vector is represented by a column of @xmath24 components , @xmath25 where @xmath26 are complex valued functions on some set of variables which will be specified later .",
    "the scalar product is defined by the equality @xmath27    let the hamiltonian @xmath28 to depend differentiably on a point of a manifold @xmath29 of dimension @xmath30 .",
    "if we choose a coordinate neighborhood @xmath31 on @xmath32 , then the hamiltonian depends on @xmath33 parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 , ( coordinates of a point @xmath36 ) .",
    "assume that position of a point @xmath36 on @xmath32 depends on time @xmath3 according to a given prescription , i.e.  the hamiltonian depends on a curve @xmath37 , @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "we assume also that the hamiltonian depends on time only through the point @xmath39 .",
    "we also presuppose that components of a vector in the hilbert space @xmath40 depend on a point of a parameter manifold @xmath29 as well .",
    "then any solution of the schrdinger equation ( [ escheq ] ) with normalization condition ( [ enorco ] ) is defined up to a constant phase factor @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "we consider the eigenvalue problem @xmath43 where @xmath44 for all @xmath29 .",
    "suppose there exists nondegenerate energy eigenvalue @xmath45 which depends on @xmath29 differentiably .",
    "the eigenfunction @xmath46 is also assumed to be a differentiable function on @xmath36 .",
    "without loss of generality , we suppose that the eigenfunction @xmath11 is normalized on unit , @xmath47 .",
    "then it is unique up to a multiplication on a phase factor which may be @xmath36 dependent .",
    "next we solve the cauchy problem for the schrdinger equation ( [ escheq ] ) with the initial condition @xmath48 where @xmath49 . in the adiabatic approximation , for slowly varying hamiltonian ,",
    "the system remains in its instantaneous eigenstate .",
    "therefore we look for the solution in the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an unknown function on @xmath29 .",
    "substitution of this expression into the schrdinger equation yields the equation for the phase factor @xmath52 where we dropped the common phase factor @xmath53 and used the commutativity of matrices @xmath54 .",
    "now we take the scalar product of left and right sides of the derived equation with @xmath11 . as a result",
    ", we obtain the equation for the phase @xmath55 with the initial condition @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath57 , the solution of the cauchy problem for equation ( [ eberfa ] ) is @xmath58 where we introduced the notation @xmath59 and the integral on @xmath36 is taken along the curve @xmath37 .    hence the integral ( [ esothe ] )",
    "yields the solution for the cauchy problem for the schrdinger equation ( [ escheq ] ) with the initial condition ( [ einval ] ) in the adiabatic approximation . the first term in eq.([esothe ] )",
    "is called the geometric or berry s phase and the second term is called the dynamical phase .    note that components ( [ edeloc ] ) are real because of normalization of the wave function . indeed , differentiation of the normalization condition @xmath47 yields the equality @xmath60 it implies the reality of components ( [ edeloc ] ) and subsequently the reality of berry s phase .",
    "we consider now a set of closed curves @xmath61 on a parameter manifold @xmath32 with the beginning and end at a point @xmath62 .",
    "then the total change in the phase of the wave function is equal to the integral @xmath63 where @xmath64    in this form , we are able to give the geometrical interpretation of the berry phase @xmath65 which is given by the first term in the obtained expression .",
    "namely , we have a principal fiber bundle @xmath66 which base is the parameter manifold @xmath29 and the structure group is @xmath0 ( geometrical phase @xmath53 ) @xcite .",
    "the vector in the hilbert space @xmath44 represents a local cross section of the associated bundle @xmath67 which typical fiber is the hilbert space @xmath6 .",
    "consider a change in the local cross section of the associated bundle which is produced by multiplication of a vector in the hilbert space on a phase factor ( vertical automorphism ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 is an arbitrary differentiable function .",
    "then components ( [ edeloc ] ) transform according to the rule @xmath70 comparing this rule with the transformation of components of a local connection form @xcite , wee see that the fields @xmath71 can be interpreted as components of a local connection form for @xmath0 group .",
    "in other words , @xmath71 is the gauge field for one dimensional unitary group @xmath0 .",
    "if the base of the associated fiber bundle @xmath67 is covered by some set of coordinate charts , @xmath72 , then a set of sections given on each coordinate chart @xmath73 defines a family of local connection forms on the principal fiber bundle @xmath66 .",
    "a family of local connection forms @xmath74 defines the unique connection on @xmath75 up to an isomorphism @xcite .",
    "let us recall the expression for an element of the holonomy group in terms of the @xmath76-exponent @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the group @xmath0 is abelian , and the @xmath76-exponent coincides with the usual exponent .",
    "therefore the berry phase ( [ ebphas ] ) defines the element @xmath77 of the holonomy group @xmath78 of the principal fiber bundle at the point @xmath79 corresponding to zero cross section @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the unit of the structure group @xmath0 .",
    "the cross section is the zero one because at the initial moment of time the berry phase vanish , @xmath83 .",
    "the connection local form @xmath74 corresponds also to zero cross section .",
    "the expression for the berry phase ( [ ebphas ] ) can be rewritten as a surface integral of the components of the local curvature form . using stoke s formulae , we obtain the following expression @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a surface in @xmath32 with the boundary @xmath61 and @xmath86 are components of the local curvature form ( gauge field strength ) .      as an example ,",
    "we calculate the berry phase for a spin 1/2 particle in an external homogeneous magnetic field . in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , a spin 1/2 particle",
    "is described by a two component wave function @xmath88 we assume that it is situated in the space @xmath89 with a given homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "let the strength of the magnetic field @xmath90 , @xmath91 , do not depend on space point but change in time @xmath3 according to some prescribed way . for simplicity ,",
    "we disregard also the kinetic energy of a particle and assume that other fields are absent . in this case , the hilbert space @xmath6 is two dimensional , and the hamiltonian of a particle consists of one term which is equal to the interaction term the magnetic momentum of a particle with external magnetic field ( see .",
    ", i.e. @xcite ) , @xmath92 where @xmath93 are pauli matrices and @xmath94 is the magneton ( dimensionfull constant which is equal to the ratio of the magnetic momentum of a particle to its spin ) . to write the hamiltonian in the form considered earlier , we introduce new variables @xmath95 .",
    "then the hamiltonian is @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "eigenvalues of hamiltonian ( [ ehaspo ] ) are found from the equation @xmath98 which has two real roots @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the length of the vector @xmath101 .",
    "it can be easily shown , that the equation for eigenfunction @xmath102 has two solutions @xmath103 the factor in this expression is chosen in such a way that the eigenfunctions are normalized on unit , @xmath104 hence the hamiltonian ( [ ehaspo ] ) for a spin 1/2 particle in the external homogeneous magnetic field has two nondegenerate eigenstates ( [ eigfuh ] ) corresponding to energy levels ( [ ehaigm ] ) .",
    "it is useful to introduce spherical coordinates @xmath105 : @xmath106 in the parameter space @xmath107 for the calculations .",
    "then the eigenfunctions take the form",
    "@xmath108    we assume that the experimentalist observing the particle varies homogeneous magnetic field differentiably in time .",
    "that is the parameters @xmath109 in the hamiltonian depend on time differentiably .",
    "assume also that the particle was in the state @xmath110 at the initial moment of time @xmath111 .",
    "the corresponding solution of the schrdinger equation ( [ escheq ] ) is @xmath112 where the phase @xmath113 satisfies eq.([eberfa ] ) .",
    "components of the local connection form @xmath114 for the eigenstate @xmath110 are easily calculated @xmath115 the respective local form of the curvature has only two nonzero components : @xmath116    now we calculate the berry phase for a closed curve in the parameter space @xmath117 , @xmath118 where @xmath85 is a surface in @xmath89 with the boundary @xmath37 and @xmath119 is the solid angle of a surface @xmath85 as it looks from the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "if the particle is in the state @xmath120 at the initial moment of time , then calculations are similar . in this case @xmath121 and components of the local form of the curvature differ in sign @xmath122 therefore the berry phase differs only by the sign .",
    "so , if a particle was in one of the states @xmath123 in the initial moment of time then after variation of the homogeneous magnetic field along a closed curve @xmath37 its wave function acquires the phase factor , the geometrical part of which is @xmath124 where @xmath119 is the solid angle at which the closed contour @xmath37 is seen from the origin .",
    "this result does not depend on how parameters @xmath37 depend on time .",
    "expression for the berry s phase ( [ eberco ] ) was confirmed experimentally @xcite for the scattering of polarized neutrons in spiral magnetic field .    the homogeneous magnetic field in the considered example may have an arbitrary direction and magnitude .",
    "therefore the base @xmath32 of the principal fiber bundle @xmath66 coincides with the euclidean space @xmath125 .",
    "hence the principal fiber bundle @xmath75 is trivial , @xmath126 . as the consequence",
    ", the berry phase is not a topological notion but a geometrical one because the topology of the principal fiber bundle is trivial .",
    "it arises due to the nontrivial connection defined by cross sections of the associated fiber bundle .",
    "the notion of the berry phase was generalized for the case when energy levels of a hamiltonian are degenerate @xcite . in this case",
    ", the principle fiber bundle @xmath127 with the structure group @xmath1 , where @xmath128 is the number of independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the degenerate energy level @xmath45 , appears in the process of solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "here we describe this construction in detail .",
    "we suppose that the hamiltonian of a quantum system depends on a point of some manifold @xmath39 as was done earlier .",
    "let @xmath45 be a degenerate eigenvalue of the hamiltonian @xmath5 with @xmath128 independent eigenfunctions @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131    eigenfunctions can be chosen orthonormalized , @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the kronecker symbol .",
    "we look for solution @xmath134 of the cauchy problem for the schrdinger equation ( [ escheq ] ) with the initial condition @xmath135 that is the system is in one of the eigenstates @xmath129 at the initial moment of time . in the adiabatic approximation , we look for the solution in the form @xmath136 where @xmath137 is some unitary matrix which depends differentiably on a point @xmath29 .",
    "the unitarity is needed for the orthonormalization of the solutions in the case under consideration , @xmath138 because orthonormalization is preserved in time .",
    "then the schrdinger equation is reduced to the equation @xmath139 take the scalar product of left and right hand sides with @xmath140 . as a result",
    ", we obtain equation for the unitary matrix @xmath141 where we introduced notation @xmath142    the orthonormalization of the eigenfunctions @xmath129 implies antiunitarity of the components @xmath143 for all @xmath35 when indices @xmath144 are considered as matrix ones . indeed , differentiation of the orthonormalization condition @xmath145 yields the equality @xmath146 that is matrices @xmath147 are antiunitary and therefore lie in the lie algebra @xmath148 .",
    "hence matrices @xmath147 define 1-forms on @xmath32 with values in the lie algebra as components of a local connection form .",
    "the initial condition for the unitary matrix is @xmath149 the solution of the cauchy problem for eq.([euneqm ] ) can be written as the @xmath76-product @xmath150 where we omitted matrix indices for simplicity .",
    "the first factor is the generalization of the berry phase to the case of degenerate states and the second one is the dynamical phase .",
    "the dynamical phase has the same form as for the nondegenerate state .",
    "the first factor in the solution ( [ ebenab ] ) represent the unitary matrix of wilczek ",
    "zee @xmath151 which can be given the following geometric interpretation .",
    "we have the principal fiber bundle @xmath127 with the structure group @xmath1 ( transformation ( [ esutra ] ) ) .",
    "the set of eigenfunctions @xmath129 is the cross section of the associated fiber bundle @xmath152 with the typical fiber being the tensor product of hilbert spaces @xmath153 under the vertical automorphism given by the unitary matrix @xmath154 , @xmath155 the fields ( [ edegau ] ) transform according to the rule @xmath156 where we omitted matrix indices .",
    "it implies that the fields @xmath147 can be interpreted as components of the local connection form or yang  mills fields .",
    "a set of these components given on a coordinate covering of the base @xmath32 defines uniquely the connection on the principal fiber bundle @xmath127 .",
    "if the path is closed , @xmath61 , then the unitary wilczek  zee matrix ( [ ewizem ] ) represents the element of the holonomy group @xmath157 at the point @xmath79 corresponding to the zero cross section @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the unity of the structure group @xmath1 .",
    "so the principal fiber bundle @xmath127 arises in the case of the degenerate energy state of the hamiltonian . in the considered case ,",
    "the base @xmath32 is the parameter manifold @xmath29 , the hamiltonian being dependent on its point .",

    ", a typical fiber of the associated fiber bundle can be infinite dimensional hilbert space @xmath158 . in the present paper",
    "we do not consider infinite dimensional manifolds to avoid the difficulties which may arise @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in our case , everything that is needed is the transformation formulae for components of the local connection form ( [ elotrs ] ) which can be easily checked in every particular case .",
    "if the associated bundle is not diffeomorphic to the direct product @xmath159 , then the state of a quantum system is given by a family of local cross sections on a coordinate covering of the base @xmath32 .",
    "it defines the family of local connection forms ( [ edegau ] ) . in its turn",
    ", the family of local connection forms defines connection on the principal fiber bundle @xmath127 uniquely up to an isomorphism .",
    "we see once again that principal and associated fiber bundles can be trivial or not depending on the problem under consideration .",

    "@xmath61 with the beginning and end at a point @xmath62 , the wilczek  zee matrix defines the element of the holonomy group @xmath160 .",
    "another example of the appearance of the nontrivial connection on the principal fiber bundle @xmath66 is given by the aharonov ",

    "clearly , the difference in phases of electrons in upper and lower beams @xmath216 can be written as integral ( [ eahboe ] ) along closed contour @xmath194 when one goes firstly along lower half of the contour and afterwards the upper half in opposite direction .    surely , since our starting point is quantum mechanics rather then the classical one , then the reasoning above is not truly justified because an electron is described by a wave function @xmath203 defined on the whole space .",
    "we assume that each electron is described by the wave function which is concentrated in sufficiently small region of space such that we can talk about an electron trajectory .",
    "corresponding solutions of the schrdinger equation can hardly be found in explicit form because of the complex geometry of the problem .",
    "but this is not needed . for our purposes , it is sufficient to suppose that such solution exists",
    ".    let us proceed with the geometric interpretation .",
    "the difference in electron phases is given by integral ( [ eahboe ] ) which is uniquely defined by the contour @xmath194 and potential @xmath190 given on this contour .",
    "on the other hand , since the base of the principal fiber bundle is the euclidean space @xmath200 in the given interpretation , the connection must be extended on the whole fiber bundle .",
    "it can be done in an arbitrary way because integral ( [ eahboe ] ) does no depend on this extension .",
    "assume that on the principal fiber bundle @xmath206 an arbitrary connection with components @xmath217 is given such that its restriction to contour @xmath194 coincides with potentials @xmath218 and @xmath215 on upper and lower halves of the contour .",
    "we assume that the component @xmath219 is a differentiable function in the whole @xmath200 .",
    "in particular , a metallic tube has a finite thickness because otherwise a singularity appears .",
    "the potential @xmath190 on contour @xmath194 can be continued on the whole space in many ways which depend on the phantasy of experimentalist .",
    "nevertheless the result of the experiment does not depend on this continuation because metallic tubes and their potentials are fixed .",
    "phase difference ( [ eahboe ] ) defines the holonomy group element @xmath220 at the point @xmath221 where @xmath222 is the space point where the beam is splitted .    by construction ,",
    "the base manifold of the principal fiber bundle @xmath223 has trivial topology .",
    "therefore the contour @xmath194 can be always contracted to a point . during this process",
    ", metallic tubes stay on their place , and the contour crosses them continuously . when the contour is contracted , the aharonov ",
    "phase @xmath224 goes to zero and the corresponding element of the holonomy group tends to unity @xmath225 .",
    "this is well known because the holonomy group is a lie subgroup in the structure group .",
    "note that contraction of a contour is not at all related to the experiment in which we observe a definite element of the holonomy group corresponding to the initial displacement of the contour .",
    "the last geometric interpretation is simply related to the interpretation which was given earlier . since the contour @xmath194 is diffeomorphic to a circle @xmath193 , we have the embedding @xmath226 where @xmath227 is a point on a circle . then the principal fiber bundle @xmath192 coincides with the induced fiber bundle @xmath228 which",
    "is obtained by restriction of the base @xmath229 to @xmath197 @xcite .",
    "the proposed construction is not the only possible .",
    "we can build a principle fiber bundle @xmath66 with an arbitrary base @xmath32 . to this end , it is sufficient to take the fiber bundle @xmath206 with the given connection and narrow down the base by exception of an arbitrary number of lines in the space @xmath89 which are perpendicular to the plane of fig.[figure1 ] and do not lie on the contour @xmath194 . as the consequence ,",
    "the base @xmath32 is no longer a simply connected space .",
    "this procedure appears artificial .",
    "moreover , it makes the problem more complicated because the initial schrdinger equation ( [ eshrch ] ) has to be solved on a topologically nontrivial manifold in this case .    at the end of this section",
    "we note the following .",
    "the schrdinger equation ( [ eschre ] ) implies that under the vertical automorphism @xmath230 where @xmath231 is a differentiable function of time , components of the local connection form transform according to the rule @xmath232 as components of local @xmath0-connection behave .",
    "thus we see that the aharonov ",
    "bohm effect as well as the berry phase is based not on a topology but on nontrivial geometry , i.e.  on a connection with nontrivial holonomy group . at the same time topology of the space",
    "can be arbitrary , in particular , trivial .",
    "now we consider the case when the electric field potential is equal to zero , @xmath233 .",
    "suppose that the magnetic field covector potential depends only on space coordinates @xmath162 and does not depend on time @xmath3 ( static field ) .",
    "then the schrdinger equation takes the form @xmath234 let @xmath11 be a solution of the schrdinger equation in the absence of the magnetic field potential @xmath235 then it is not difficult to verify that the function @xmath236 where the phase @xmath113 satisfies the equation @xmath237 is the solution of the original schrdinger equation ( [ eshmaf ] ) .",
    "aharonov and bohm proposed the experiment for determining the phase @xmath113 which scheme is shown in fig.[figure2 ] . in this experiment",
    ", the beam of electrons is splitted in two ones bending from different sides a thin solenoid with constant magnetic flux @xmath238 which is perpendicular to the plane of the figure .",
    "afterwards the beams are gathered together , and the interference picture depending on the phase difference of electrons in different beams is observed on the screen .",
    "the difference in phase can be written as the contour integral @xmath239 where the contour @xmath194 surrounds the solenoid .",
    "this integral does not depend on the chosen contour surrounding the solenoid because the magnetic field outside the solenoid vanishes , @xmath240 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    the aharonov ",
    "bohm phase can be rewritten using the stokes formulae as the surface integral @xmath241 where @xmath242 is the magnetic field strength ( components of the local curvature 2-form ) and @xmath238 is the total magnetic flux through the solenoid .",
    "note that we have to assume that the magnetic field is defined everywhere in space @xmath89 including the solenoid axis itself to use of the stokes formulae .",
    "the geometric interpretation of the described aharonov ",
    "bohm effect is as follows .",
    "we have the same principal fiber bundle @xmath206 as it was for the electric potential , the base being four - dimensional euclidean space @xmath199 in which electrons move and the structure group is the unitary group @xmath0 ( the phase factor @xmath53 of the wave function ) .",
    "however connection is now different : only space components of local connection form @xmath175 , @xmath163 , differ from zero .",
    "the aharonov ",
    "bohm phase difference ( [ eahbkm ] ) is uniquely defined by the contour @xmath194 and values of the connection form @xmath175 on it .",
    "writing the contour integral as the surface one ( [ eahbom ] ) , we must assume that the connection is continued to the whole space @xmath89 in such a way that components of the local connection form are differentiable functions .",
    "it means that we consider solenoid of finite radius to avoid singularities . of course",
    ", the result does not depend on the way of continuation due to the stokes theorem .",
    "so the aharonov ",
    "bohm effect must be considered as geometrical rather then topological .    since the potential of the magnetic field does not depend on time",
    ", the base @xmath200 of the principal fiber bundle @xmath223 can be restricted to the space part @xmath89 .",
    "the result does not depend on that .",
    "we deliberately retained the dependence on time to show that the principal fiber bundle coincides with that in the case of electric potential .",
    "so the principal fiber bundle is trivial and the aharonov ",
    "bohm phase @xmath224 depending on the connection and the contour uniquely defines the element of the holonomy group .",
    "when the contour is contracted to a point the corresponding element of the holonomy group tends to unity @xmath225 as it must be . here",
    "we assume that the contour goes freely through the solenoid .",
    "the wave function of the electron is the cross section of the associated fiber bundle @xmath204 with the euclidean space @xmath200 as the base , the structure group being the unitary group @xmath0 . under the vertical automorphism @xmath230 where @xmath243 is a differentiable function of space coordinates @xmath162 , @xmath163 , the magnetic field potential transforms according to the rule @xmath244 it follows from the schrdinger equation ( [ eshmaf ] ) .",
    "thus components of the magnetic field potential have indeed the behavior of components of the local connection form .",
    "many authors consider infinitely thin solenoid and the euclidean space @xmath89 with removed axis corresponding to the solenoid as the base @xmath32 . in this case , the base @xmath32 is not simply connected , and the aharonov ",
    "bohm effect could be called topological . as was shown earlier ,",
    "this is not necessary .",
    "it is sufficient to assume that the magnetic field differs from zero only in the bounded region on the plane , and the integration contour does not cross this region .",
    "moreover , if we assume that the base @xmath32 is the euclidean space @xmath89 with removed axis then the stokes formulae is not applicable , and hence the expression for the aharonov ",
    "bohm phase through the magnetic field flux ( [ eahbom ] ) requires additional assumptions .",
    "so the aharonov ",
    "bohm effect must be considered as geometrical rather then topological .",
    "the aharonov ",
    "bohm effect with electric as well as magnetic potential attracts much interest of physicists because of the following . according to the contemporary point of view ,",
    "the gauge invariant quantities are the only observables in gauge models . from this point of view , the electromagnetic field potential @xmath173 , @xmath169 , itself is not observable because it is not gauge invariant . in the considered cases ,",
    "the electron beams are not subjected to the electromagnetic field action because the electric and magnetic field strengths are zero in the regions where electrons move .",
    "therefore it seems that the difference in phases of electron beams has to be zero .",
    "but it is not so as the consequence of the schrdinger equation .",
    "we have to note that observable is not the electromagnetic field potential itself but its integral along a closed contour defining the element of the holonomy group of the @xmath0 connection which is the gauge invariant object .    soon after publication of the paper , the aharonov ",
    "bohm effect was confirmed experimentally .",
    "the effect caused by the magnetic potential was observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we give the geometric interpretation of the berry phase , its non - abelian generalization by wilczek and zee , and the aharonov  bohm effect .",
    "all these effects are shown to be the consequences of nontrivial connections on the principal fiber bundles which define nontrivial holonomy group . at the same time",
    ", the topology of the principal fiber bundle can be trivial .",
    "therefore the considered effects are not topological as they are often called in contemporary physical literature but rather geometrical effects .",
    "the interpretation proposed in the paper is universal because contains nothing except differential geometric notions . in a geometric interpretation of mathematical physics models ,",
    "one has to take into account that a connection exists on any principal fiber bundle independently on a topology of the base @xcite .",
    "moreover , if a family of local connection forms is given on an arbitrary closed submanifold of the base of some principal fiber bundle , then the corresponding connection can be always extended to the whole principal fiber bundle .",
    "this can be done in many ways .",
    "a connection defines the holonomy group which is nontrivial in a general case . in experiments for testing of the existence of berry s phase and the aharonov ",
    "bohm effect , the observed effects are produced not by the whole holonomy group but a fixed element of the holonomy group which depends on the connection and the closed contour .",
    "the topology of the base may be trivial or not , it does not play any role . if the topology is trivial then the contour can be contracted to a point .",
    "the effect disappears in this case because the corresponding element of the holonomy group tends to the unity element , and this is quite natural from physical point of view .",
    "a connection on a principal fiber bundle defines connections on all fiber bundles which are associated with it .",
    "in particular , if the typical fiber is an infinitely dimensional hilbert space , then the connection is also defined . at present , the interpretation of berry s phase and the aharonov ",
    "bohm effect as a rule reduced to consideration of a connection on a associated fiber bundle , and this forces to consider infinite dimensional manifolds and to take into account the related subtleties . from our point of view , the interpretation of the geometric effects in terms of connections on principal fiber bundles is simpler and more natural .",
