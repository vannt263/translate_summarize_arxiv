    "i will , however , do just that , concentrating in particular on what we know about @xmath1 and @xmath7 parity violation experiments in which we control the spin of the incident nucleon , in other words experiments that use the nucleon spin as a tool , rather than experiments concerned with the nature of the nucleon spin itself .",
    "i will give a historical overview of @xmath0 and @xmath5 parity violation experiments , with technical details of the experiments i am most familiar with  the triumf 221 mev @xmath0 experiment and the los alamos @xmath9 experiment now being installed at lansce .",
    "what i cover is a biased personal selection , and i refer readers interested in more background to two fine reviews of the field by adelberger and haxton @xcite and haeberli and holstein @xcite .",
    "the parity operation reflects all space coordinates through the origin ( @xmath10 ) , which is equivalent to a mirror reflection ( which reverses only one space coordinate ) and a 180@xmath11 rotation ( which reverses the other two ) . since we can assume rotational invariance , the parity operation is often thought of as simply a mirror reflection .",
    "if a process is not identical to its mirror image , it is said to be parity violating ( pv ) or parity nonconserving ( pnc ) . in physics ,",
    "parity violation is exclusive to processes involving the weak interaction , such as :    1 .",
    "@xmath12 2 .",
    "@xmath13 ;  @xmath14 3 .",
    "@xmath15 4 .",
    "@xmath16    the first three examples , in the leptonic , semi - leptonic and hadronic @xmath17 , sectors , clearly involve the weak interaction ; the decays shown would disappear without it .",
    "the last example , however , in the purely hadronic @xmath18 sector , is so dominated by the strong interaction that , were the weak interaction to disappear , the process would be virtually unchanged .",
    "the only way to see the effects of the weak interaction in such processes is to look for parity violation , and the experimental signal is very small . in @xmath1 scattering , for example , the parity violating part of the scattering cross section is typically of order @xmath19 of the parity conserving part .",
    ".summary of @xmath0 parity violation experiments . the long times taken to achieve small uncertainties",
    "reflects the time taken to understand and correct for systematic errors . in cases where authors reported both statistical and systematic uncertainties ,",
    "this table shows the quadrature sum of the two .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^ , > \" , ]     [ corr ]    the triumf @xmath1 experiment @xcite is a transmission experiment , as depicted in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ pptypes ] .",
    "a 221 mev longitudinally polarized proton beam was passed through a 40 cm long liquid hydrogen target , which scattered about 4% of the beam .",
    "hydrogen filled ion chambers located upstream and downstream of the target measured the change in transmission when the spin of the incident protons was flipped from right - handed to left - handed .",
    "although a very good optically pumped polarized ion source @xcite was used that minimized the changes in beam properties other than helicity , other beam properties still change very slightly .",
    "these helicity - correlated beam property changes cause a systematic shift in the @xmath20 distribution , and corrections must be made . to do this",
    ", the triumf group continuously measured the helicity correlated changes in beam properties and made corrections based on the sensitivities determined in separate control measurements .",
    "the data before and after correction are shown in fig .",
    "[ e497corr ] .",
    "the main effect visible to the eye is from _ first moments of transverse polarization _ resulting from the distribution of transverse polarization components across the beam .",
    "all the corrections are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the measured @xmath20 actually came half from true parity violation and half from false effects .",
    "unlike the @xmath0 experiments just discussed , which are sensitive to @xmath21 and @xmath22 exchange , @xmath9 experiments are sensitive almost exclusively to pion exchange , and measure the weak pion - nucleon coupling , @xmath23 . , where @xmath24 is the strong pion - nucleon coupling . ] measurements such as the circular @xmath25-ray polarization from @xmath26ne @xcite , or the longitudinal analyzing power in @xmath27 scattering @xcite ,",
    "provide constraints on a combination of @xmath28 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 couplings . the most precise limit on @xmath23 alone",
    "is believed to be from measurements of circularly polarized gamma rays from a parity mixed doublet in @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "these results , however , are only about 10% of theoretical predictions @xcite , which give @xmath30 , and are also at odds with the large value of @xmath23 deduced from measurements of the anapole moment in @xmath31 @xcite ,",
    "although the @xmath31 experiment is also sensitive to @xmath32 , and , as pointed out by wilburn and bowman , @xcite the disagreement may not be too significant .",
    "@xmath33 radiative capture measurements can be made with unpolarized neutrons , as was done in the leningrad experiment @xcite , but the circular polarization , @xmath34 , of the capture gammas must be measured and the analyzing power of the polarimeters is very low . in an @xmath9 experiment , the incident cold neutrons are polarized vertically and the gamma rays produced by neutron capture in the hydrogen target are expected to be emitted slightly more in the direction opposite to the neutron spin .",
    "the up - down asymmetry @xmath35 provides a clean measure of @xmath23 free of nuclear structure uncertainties @xcite .",
    "previous measurements at ill grenoble gave @xmath36 @xcite and @xmath37 @xcite , but neither result was accurate enough to impose a significant constraint .",
    "an experiment is now being prepared at los alamos to measure the gamma ray asymmetry in @xmath9 with an uncertainty of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the expected asymmetry is @xmath39 .",
    "the apparatus is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ npdgexp ] . a pulsed , 800 mev , 100 - 150 @xmath40a proton beam impinges on a tungsten spallation target .",
    "neutrons from the spallation target are cooled in a liquid hydrogen moderator and transported to the experiment in a neutron guide .",
    "the neutron guide prevents the @xmath41 intensity fall - off that would otherwise occur , and also enhances the fraction of low energy neutrons . the peak neutron flux through the 9.5 cm x 9.5 cm guide is @xmath42 n / ms at 8 mev .",
    "experiment at lansce . ]",
    "the neutrons are polarized by passing through a polarized @xmath43 spin filter .",
    "neutrons with spin parallel to the @xmath43 spin pass through the filter , while neutrons with spin anti - parallel to the @xmath43 spin are captured .",
    "the neutron polarization is determined by the front monitors located before and after the spin filter .",
    "if half the neutrons are captured , the polarization of the downstream neutron beam is 100% .",
    "a test @xmath43 spin filter was demonstrated in a fall 2000 test run and the final version will be tested at the university of michigan in fall 2002 .",
    "the polarized neutrons are captured in a 30 cm long , 20 l liquid para - hydrogen target operating at 17 k. the low temperature is important to keep a small ( 0.03% ) equilibrium ortho - hydrogen fraction , as the spin 1 ortho - hydrogen molecule allows spin - flip scattering and destroys the asymmetry .",
    "the cross section for scattering from ortho - hydrogen is approximately 20 times that for scattering from para - hydrogen , so the neutron detector downstream of the target will indicate any change in the ortho - hydrogen fraction .",
    "approximately 60% of the neutrons are captured in the para - hydrogen , producing a deuteron and a 2.2 mev gamma ray .",
    "the gamma rays are measured by an array of 48 15 x 15 @xmath44 csi(tl ) detectors surrounding the target .",
    "the neutron spin is flipped 20 times per second by a 30 khz rf spin filter .",
    "the rf itself has a very small ( @xmath45 mm ) skin depth in , and is well contained by , the conducting shell surrounding the spin filter . in the fall 2000",
    "test runs at lansce , the on - axis spin flipper efficiency was > 95% .",
    "the neutron beam is pulsed at 20 hz , so the data acquisition operates in 50 ms `` frames '' .",
    "the pulsed beam makes it possible to identify neutrons by their time of flight over the 22 m flight path .",
    "the fast neutrons arrive at the target first , and for the first 9 ms the neutron energy is above the 15 mev required to excite a para - to - ortho transition in the para - hydrogen target . for this reason , the first 9 ms of a frame will have no physics asymmetry and can be used to measure background . from 9 ms to 30 ms , the neutron energy falls from 15 mev to 1.5 mev .",
    "the amplitude of the rf spin filter is synchronized with this fall to ensure that fast and slow neutrons are all rotated by 180@xmath11 .",
    "after 40 ms , a `` frame overlap chopper '' blocks the neutrons so that slow neutrons from one frame are not still arriving when fast neutrons from the next pulse arrive . during the 40 ms to 50 ms dead interval",
    ", electronic noise can be checked .",
    "different systematic errors have a different dependence on neutron energy and their time - of - flight signatures can be used to identify them .",
    "in addition , the @xmath43 spin filter direction and the overall holding field can be reversed for further cancellation of systematic errors .",
    "the beamline , fp12 , is now almost complete at lansce .",
    "the experimental cave is scheduled for installation in early 2003 and commissioning runs are planned for summer and fall of 2003 .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath7 parity violation experiments provide a means to study the hadronic , @xmath18 part of the weak interaction .",
    "@xmath46 experiments are sensitive to the long range part of the nucleon - nucleon interaction and constrain the weak pion - nucleon coupling constant , @xmath6 . despite decades of experimental and theoretical work ,",
    "the strength of this coupling is still very uncertain .",
    "the new , precision experiment now under construction at the lansce pulsed neutron source at los alamos should finally lay this question to rest .",
    "@xmath0 parity violation experiments are sensitive to the shorter range part of the nucleon - nucleon force and constrain the combinations @xmath47 and @xmath48 . prior to 2001 ,",
    "low energy experiments had constrained only a linear combination of approximately equal parts @xmath49 and @xmath50 . with the addition of the triumf 221 mev result in 2001 , @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "are now separately constrained .",
    "the data so far are not sufficient to determine all 6 couplings , @xmath51 , and much careful experimental work remains to be done .",
