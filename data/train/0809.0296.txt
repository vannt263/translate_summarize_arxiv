    "we select events with two identified leptons of different flavor and opposite electric charge . to distinguish the flavor , we select only hadronic taus .",
    "the kinematic cuts of the leptons are the following : electron @xmath22 , muon @xmath23 and tau visible @xmath24 .",

    "are used to generate the simulated samples .    along with the backgrounds listed above , qcd events with jets faking either leptons , or with one jet faking a lepton ( muon , tau ) and one @xmath45 faking an electron are background to the signal . to estimate this background , we use events with same charge in data since there is no correlation between the charge of the leptons in dijet and @xmath46jet events .",
