    "discrepancy theory is a branch of mathematics dealing with irregularities of distributions of points in some space in combinatorial , measure - theoretic and geometric settings  @xcite .",
    "the paradigmatic combinatorial discrepancy theory problem can be described in terms of a hypergraph @xmath15 , that is , a set @xmath16 and a family of its subsets @xmath17 .",
    "consider a colouring @xmath18 of the elements of @xmath16 in _ blue _ @xmath19 and _ red _ ( @xmath20 ) colours .",
    "then one may ask whether there exists a colouring of the elements of @xmath21 such that colours are distributed uniformly in every element of @xmath22 or a discrepancy of colours is always inevitable .",
    "formally , the discrepancy ( deviation from a uniform distribution ) of a hypergraph @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 .",
    "discrepancy theory has found applications in computational complexity  @xcite , complexity of communication  @xcite and differential privacy  @xcite .",
    "one of the oldest problems of discrepancy theory is the discrepancy of hypergraphs over sets of natural numbers with the subsets ( hyperedges ) forming arithmetical progressions over these sets  @xcite .",
    "theorem  @xcite , one of the main results in the area , states that for the hypergraph formed by the arithmetic progressions in @xmath25 , that is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and elements of @xmath28 being of the form @xmath29 for arbitrary @xmath30 , the discrepancy grows at least as @xmath31 .",
    "surprisingly , for the more restricted case of _ homogeneous _ arithmetic progressions of the form @xmath32 , the question of the discrepancy bounds is open for more than eighty years . in 1930s",
    "paul erds conjectured  @xcite that discrepancy is unbounded .",
    "independently the same conjecture has been raised by @xcite . proving or disproving",
    "this conjecture became one of the major open problems in combinatorial number theory and discrepancy theory .",
    "it has been referred to as the _ erds discrepancy problem _ ( edp )  @xcite .",
    "the expected value of the discrepancy of random @xmath1 sequences of length @xmath33 grows as @xmath34 and the explicit constructions of a sequence with slowly growing discrepancy at the rate of @xmath35 have been demonstrated  @xcite . by considering cases",
    ", one can see that any @xmath36 sequence containing @xmath37 or more elements has discrepancy at least @xmath10 ; that is , erds s conjecture holds for the particular case @xmath7 ( also implied by a stronger result of mathias  ) . until recently the status of the conjecture remained unknown for all other values of @xmath0 .",
    "although widely believed not to be the case , there was still a possibility that an infinite sequence of discrepancy 2 existed .    the conjecture whether the discrepancy of an arbitrary @xmath36 sequence is unbounded is equivalent to the question whether the discrepancy of a completely multiplicative @xmath36 sequence is unbounded , where a sequence is completely multiplicative if @xmath38 for any @xmath39  @xcite . for completely multiplicative sequences",
    "the choices of how the sequence can be constructed are severely limited as the entire sequence is defined by the values of @xmath40 for prime @xmath41 .",
    "the longest completely multiplicative sequence of discrepancy @xmath10 has length @xmath42  @xcite . for discrepancy @xmath14",
    "the bound was not known .",
    "the edp has attracted renewed interest in 2009 - 2010 as it became a topic of the fifth polymath project   a widely publicised endeavour in collective math initiated by t.  gowers  .",
    "as part of this activity an attempt has been made to attack the problem using computers ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "a purposely written computer program had successfully found @xmath36 sequences of length @xmath9 and discrepancy @xmath10 ; however , no further progress has been made leading to a claim `` given how long a finite sequence can be , it seems unlikely that we could answer this question just by a clever search of all possibilities on a computer ''  @xcite .",
    "the status of the erds discrepancy conjecture for @xmath8 has been settled by the authors of this article @xcite , @xcite by reduction to sat .",
    "the method is based on establishing the correspondence between @xmath36 sequences that violate a given discrepancy bound and words accepted by of a finite automaton .",
    "traces of this automaton are represented then by a propositional formula and state of the art sat solvers are used to prove that the longest @xmath36 sequence of discrepancy @xmath10 contains @xmath11 elements .",
    "a @xmath43 long @xmath36 sequence of discrepancy @xmath14 was also constructed .",
    "this article is a revised and extended version of  @xcite .",
    "we use a different smaller sat encoding of the erds discrepancy problem , which is based on the sequential counter encoding of the _ at most _ cardinality constraints .",
    "the impact of the new encoding is twofold .",
    "firstly , it allows us to significantly reduce the size of the machine - generated proof of the fact that any sequence longer than @xmath11 has discrepancy at least @xmath14 .",
    "secondly , by combining the new encoding with additional restrictions that the sequence is multiplicative , or completely multiplicative , we improve significantly the lower bound on the length of sequences of discrepancy @xmath14 .",
    "we prove the surprising result that @xmath13 , the length of the longest completely multiplicative sequence of discrepancy @xmath14 , is also the maximal length of a multiplicative sequence of discrepancy @xmath14 , which is not the case for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the article also contains detailed argumentation , examples and complete proofs .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] we introduce the main terms and definition . in section  [ sec :",
    "encoding ] we describe the new sat encoding of the erds discrepancy problem . results and conclusions are discussed in sections  [ sec : experiments ] and  [ sec : conclusion ] respectively . to improve readability a number of technical proofs",
    "have been deferred to an appendix .",
    "we divide this section into three parts : main definitions for the erds discrepancy problem , some background and definitions for sat solving , and sequential counter - based sat encoding of cardinality constraints .    since number @xmath44 is used both as an element of @xmath36 sequences and as the logical value _ true _ , to avoid confusion , in what follows we write @xmath44 to refer to the logical value _ true _ and @xmath45 to refer to elements of @xmath36 sequences .",
    "we also use the following naming convention : we write @xmath46 for @xmath36 sequences , @xmath47 for sequences of propositions , and @xmath48 for @xmath49 boolean sequences .",

    "propositional formulae are defined over boolean constants _ true _ and _ false _ , denoted by @xmath44 and @xmath97 , respectively , and the set of boolean variables ( or propositions ) @xmath98 as follows : boolean constants @xmath97 and @xmath44 , as well as the elements of @xmath98 , are formulae ; if @xmath99 and @xmath100 are formulae then so are @xmath101 ( conjunction ) , @xmath102 ( disjunction ) , @xmath103 ( implication ) , @xmath104 ( equivalence ) and @xmath105 ( negation ) .",
    "we typically use letters @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 to denote propositions and capital greek letters @xmath99 and @xmath100 to denote propositional formulae .",

    "propositions and negations of propositions are called _",
    "literals_. when the negation is applied to a literal , double negations are implicitly removed , that is , if @xmath110 is @xmath111 then @xmath112 is @xmath106 .",
    "a disjunction of literals is called a _ clause_. a clause containing exactly",
    "one literal is called a unit clause . a conjunction of clauses",
    "is called a propositional formula in _ conjunctive normal form _ , a cnf formula for short .",
    "a clause can be represented by the set of its literals and the empty clause correspond to @xmath97 ( _ false _ ) .",
    "a cnf formula can be represented by the set its clauses .",
    "these representations are used interchangeably .",
    "we typically use meaningful terms typeset in sans serif font , for example @xmath113 or @xmath114 , to highlight the fact that a propositional formula is a cnf formula of interest .    for a propositional formula @xmath99 , we write @xmath115 to indicate that @xmath116",
    ". propositions @xmath47 are designated as ` input ' propositions in this case , and the intended meaning is that formula @xmath99 encodes some property of @xmath47 . then the expression @xmath117 denotes the result of simultaneous replacement of every occurrence of @xmath118 in @xmath99 with @xmath119 , for @xmath120 .",
    "the semantics of propositional formulae is given by interpretations ( also termed assignments ) .",
    "an interpretation @xmath121 is a mapping @xmath122 extended to literals , clauses , cnf formulae and propositional formulae in general in the usual way . for an assignment @xmath121 and a formula @xmath99",
    "we say that @xmath121 satisfies @xmath99 ( or @xmath121 is a model of @xmath99 ) if @xmath123 .",
    "a formula @xmath99 is satisfiable if there exists an assignment that satisfies it , and unsatisfiable otherwise .    despite the non - tractability of the satisfiability problem ,",
    "the tremendous progress in recent years made it possible to solve many interesting hard problems by first expressing them as a propositional formula and then using a sat solver for obtaining a solution  @xcite .",
    "in addition to returning a satisfying assignment , if the input formula is satisfiable , some sat solvers are also capable to return a proof ( or certificate ) of unsatisfiability .",
    "reverse unit propagation ( rup ) proofs constitute a compact representation of the resolution refutation of the given formula  @xcite in the following sense .",
    "_ unit propagation _ is a cnf formula transformation technique , which simplifies the formula by fixing the values of propositions occurring to its unit clauses to satisfy these clauses .",
    "that is , if the unit clause @xmath124 occurs in the cnf formula then all occurrences of @xmath106 are replaced by @xmath44 and if the unit clause @xmath125 occurs in the cnf formula , all occurrences of @xmath106 are replaced by @xmath97 .",
    "then the cnf formula is simplified in the obvious way .",
    "a clause @xmath126 is a rup inference from the input cnf formula @xmath100 if adding the unit clauses @xmath127 to @xmath100 makes the whole formula refutable by unit propagation .",
    "a rup unsatisfiability certificate is the sequence of clauses @xmath128 such that for every @xmath129 the clause @xmath130 is a rup inference from @xmath131 and @xmath132 is the empty clause .",
    "every unsatisfiable cnf formula has a rup unsatisfiability certificate  @xcite .",
    "delete reverse unit propagation ( drup ) proofs extend rup proofs by including extra information about the proof search process , namely clauses that have been discarded by the solver .",
    "eliminating this extra information from a drup proof converts it to a valid rup proof .",
    "drup proofs are somewhat longer but they are significantly faster to verify than a rup proof  @xcite .      cardinality constraints  @xcite are expressions that impose restrictions on interpretations by specifying numerical bounds on the number of propositions , from a fixed set of propositions , that can be assigned value @xmath44 .",
    "the _ at most @xmath133 _ constraint over the set of propositions @xmath134 , written as @xmath135 , holds for an interpretation @xmath121 if , and only if , at most @xmath133 propositions among @xmath47 are true under @xmath121 .",

    "notice that instead of including formulae ( [ eq : sinz_card_2 ] ) and ( [ eq : sinz_card_3 ] ) explicitly in the encoding , one can directly modify ( [ eq : sinz_card_1 ] ) by replacing all occurrences of @xmath137 , for @xmath144 , with @xmath97 ( the truth value _ false _ ) and all occurrences of @xmath137 , for @xmath145 and all @xmath146 , with @xmath44 ( the truth value _ true _ ) .",

    "it follows from proposition  [ prop : sinz ] that the formula @xmath162 enforces the cardinality constraint @xmath135 .",

    "then the value of @xmath167 under @xmath121 can still be true , as long as @xmath168 , while not violating the cardinality constraint @xmath169 .    for our purposes we require an unoptimised version of the encoding with a tighter restriction on the values of @xmath137 stated in proposition  [ prop : sinz ] .",
