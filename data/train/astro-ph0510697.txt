    "great progress has been made over the past few years in our observational understanding of galaxies at the end of the first billion years of the universe .",
    "much of this progress has come at @xmath9 and has been due in large part to the substantial gains in surveying efficiency made in the optical by the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on hst .",
    "this instrument provides us with a nearly @xmath10 increase in optical imaging efficiency over what was available with wfpc2 , higher resolution imaging , and a reasonably efficient , red @xmath11-band filter . putting together these capabilities with the well - established dropout technique ( e.g. , [ 27 ] ) , it became possible to select literally hundreds to thousands of galaxies at redshifts of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "experience over the past two years has shown that a simple @xmath12 color selection is remarkably effective at isolating galaxies at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "though a small fraction of the selected sources are found to be low mass stars and low - redshift galaxies , most of these contaminants can be eliminated by making some requirement on their stellarity ( i.e. , how pointlike they are ) or their flux in a bluer band ( e.g. , the @xmath13-band ) .",
    "these results have now been verified spectroscopically down to @xmath14 @xcite .    with this increasing understanding of the @xmath15-dropout selection , different studies attempted to construct rest - frame continuum @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) luminosity functions ( lfs ) at @xmath0 @xcite . despite small differences in detail ,",
    "each of these studies find that there were significantly fewer galaxies at @xmath0 ( per volume element ) than at @xmath2 .",
    "a recent determination of this lf by our team is shown in figure  [ fig : ilf]a and incorporates the results from some @xmath18 @xmath15-dropouts selected from the two goods fields ( enhanced to include the sne search data  to be goods v2.0 ) , two acs parallel fields to the udf , and the udf @xcite .",
    "for comparison , we have also plotted the @xmath2 lf @xcite , and it is amazing to note that the @xmath0 lf extends fainter than at @xmath2 , demonstrating the remarkable surveying efficiency of current optical instrumentation .",
    "it is also evident that our @xmath0 lf shows a much larger deficit at the bright end than at the faint end , suggesting that higher redshift galaxies are of much lower luminosity ( on average ) .",
    "this explains ( at least in part ) why early searches down to brighter limiting magnitudes @xcite found more substantial evolution than similar searches down to fainter magnitudes @xcite .",
    "we can look at this evolution more quantitatively . in figure",
    "[ fig : ilf]b , we plot the likelihood contours for the @xmath0 lf and contrast it with the equivalent values at @xmath2 ( thick black cross ) .",
    "the red shaded regions on this plot indicate those values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 which are ruled out at 95% confidence using the current hst data . though the constraints on the faint - end slope @xmath19 at @xmath0 are still somewhat modest , the preferred values for the characteristic luminosity @xmath20 are much fainter than at @xmath2 , suggesting that there has been evolution in the characteristic scales on which star formation is occurring .",
    "this provides us with one of our first , most direct evidences for the hierarchical buildup of galaxies early in the history of the universe ( see also [ 14 ] and [ 29 ] ) .",
    "further refinements to the @xmath0 lf should be forthcoming over the next year due to the availability of two additional deep fields to be taken with acs ( go-10632 ) .",
    "extending the dropout search beyond @xmath0 requires the detection of objects in the infrared .",
    "this has been difficult due to the well - known limitations of infrared technology and because @xmath7 objects are likely to be very faint . at @xmath0 ,",
    "the characteristic luminosity is nearly @xmath21 mags fainter than at @xmath2 .",
    "extrapolated to even higher redshift , these luminosities should be even fainter still , perhaps 0.3 @xmath22 . in the @xmath23-band",
    ", this corresponds to a magnitude of 27.3 , which can only be reached in deep nicmos studies and very deep ground - based studies around massive lensing clusters .",
    "the deep nicmos imaging over the optical udf provided us with one of our first opportunities to find @xmath7 galaxies .",
    "the @xmath24 limiting depths in these data were 27.6 in the @xmath25-band and 27.4 in the @xmath26-band .",
    "moreover , the optical data for this field were more than sufficient to set strong constraints on the @xmath27-band fluxes . using a relatively aggressive set of detection criteria",
    ", we carried out a @xmath27-dropout selection on these data and found 5 @xmath7 candidates .",
    "successive tests on our selection  including scattering experiments and selection on the negative images  suggested that most of our 5 candidates were likely at @xmath7 and there was only one contaminant .",
    "we therefore adopted as our likely sample 4 fiducial candidates .    to assess the implications of this first statistical sample of @xmath7 objects",
    ", we generated no - evolution predictions based upon a lower redshift @xmath28 @xmath29-dropout sample@xcite using our well - established cloning machinery @xcite .",
    "an important consideration in projecting these lower redshift samples to high redshifts was the observed evolution in size @xcite and uv color @xcite .",
    "running through these simulations , we estimated that 14 objects would be found ( if there was no - evolution from @xmath28 ) .",
    "we compared this prediction with our 4 fiducial @xmath11-dropout candidates , given the expected small but non - zero contamination .",
    "this suggested that the rest - frame uv ( @xmath30 ) luminosity density at @xmath7 was just @xmath31 that at @xmath28 ( number weighted ) or @xmath32 the @xmath28 value ( if we use a luminosity weighting ) .",
    "though a first estimate of the rest - frame @xmath16 luminosity density at @xmath7 , our determination still suffered from some substantial uncertainties , notably the poissonian errors ( @xmath33% ) , cosmic variance ( factor of 2 ) , as well as the overall contamination level ( @xmath34 objects )",
    ". this situation should improve substantially over the next year using data from two hst programs : ( 1 ) a deep @xmath27-dropout search in the field ( go-10632 ) and ( 2 ) a similar search around seven massive lensing clusters ( go-10504 and go-10699 ) .",
    "both should yield @xmath35 @xmath7 candidates , substantially reducing uncertainties from our previously quoted estimates based on the hudf nicmos footprint .",
    "simultaneously , searches with large ground - based telescopes are ongoing and have yielded a sizeable number of candidates , particularly around lensing clusters @xcite .",

    "though only modest constraints are possible on the @xmath0 faint - end slope @xmath19 , the characteristic luminosity at @xmath0 appears to be @xmath37 mags fainter than at @xmath2.[fig : ilf],title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the detection and confirmation of galaxies at @xmath5 appears to be significantly more difficult than even at @xmath7 .",
    "though the additional distance plays a small role , by far the biggest challenge is their luminosity : @xmath5 galaxies are expected to have very low luminosities , several times lower than at @xmath0 or @xmath7 @xcite . even assuming no evolution in luminosity from @xmath7 to @xmath5 , typical magnitudes for these objects would be @xmath3828 in the @xmath23-band , suggesting that one would need to probe to very faint magnitudes indeed .",
    "one way of reaching such magnitudes is to use the very deep ir imaging capabilities of the hst nicmos camera .",
    "unfortunately , even with this instrument , searches for @xmath5 objects are still extremely expensive , e.g. , @xmath39 orbits are needed to detect just one @xmath5 object , and this assumes that the uv lf does not evolve from @xmath5 to @xmath0 .",
    "it is thus no surprise that there has been a lack of dedicated searches .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to take advantage of the deep @xmath25 and @xmath26 parallel data associated with several hst deep fields to conduct a search .",
    "such data is available for the hdf - s ( 150 orbits ) and the udf ( @xmath38340 orbits ) .",
    "there is also deep nicmos j+h imaging over the wfpc2 hdf - n ( 176 orbits ) and a portion of the acs udf ( 144 orbits ) .",
    "the @xmath24 limiting magnitudes of these data range from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , which is sufficient to identify @xmath5 galaxies down to @xmath42 .    to see what we could learn from these data",
    ", we carried out a search for @xmath43 @xmath44-dropouts and found 11 objects @xcite .",
    "we eliminated those objects with @xmath45 detections in the optical bands or with @xmath46 colors substantially redder than the typical starburst type object ( i.e. , uv continuum slopes @xmath47 ) .",
    "this left us with 3 candidates , all of which are in the nicmos parallel fields to the udf . since we did not have comparably deep images blueward or redward of the @xmath48 passbands , it was difficult for us to be very sure about the redshifts of our 3 candidates . nevertheless , we could still compare these 3 candidates with the numbers expected assuming no - evolution from @xmath0 . repeating the simulations described in",
    " 3 , we estimated that 4.8 @xmath25-dropouts would be found , only somewhat higher than our 3 candidates .",
    "if we assume that all three candidates were at @xmath5 , the normalization we would obtain for the @xmath5 lf is just @xmath49 that at @xmath0 . on the other hand , assuming that none of these candidates were at these redshifts , the normalization we would obtain is just @xmath50 the @xmath0 value ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "remarkably , we found that these results were not very sensitive to cosmic variance ( @xmath51% rms ) .",
    "this is due to the extremely large comoving distances probed in @xmath44-dropout searches ( @xmath52 mpc ) .",
    "the current round of hst proposals should strengthen these constraints significantly . not only",
    "will we increase the total nicmos observing time relevant to these searches by @xmath53% ( improving the statistics ) , but we will obtain some very deep acs observations ( @xmath54 mag at @xmath24 for apertures that match the nicmos data ) over the deep nicmos parallels containing our 3 @xmath5 candidates .",
    "independent searches are also ongoing around lensing clusters ( go-10380 , go-10504 , gto-10699 , and [ 22 ] ) , and we note that there are claims by some teams to have a very good set of candidates .",
    "current observations are now of sufficient quality to robustly determine the rest - frame @xmath16 ( @xmath55 ) luminosity function at @xmath0 .",
    "these determinations extend to nearly three magnitudes below @xmath1 , fainter than has been possible at @xmath2 , demonstrating the efficiency of current optical technology .",
    "substantial changes are evident in the lf relative to @xmath2 , suggesting that typical galaxies have more than doubled their star formation rates over this interval .",
    "the observed evolution is suggestive of that expected from popular hierarchical models , and would seem to indicate that we are literally witnessing the buildup of galaxies over this range .",
    "progress with higher redshift dropout samples has been less dramatic , but is still forthcoming .",
    "our sample of @xmath7 @xmath27-dropouts in the hudf provided our first statistical sample of galaxies in this epoch and thus allowed an initial estimate of the luminosity density@xcite .",
    "searches for higher redshift @xmath5 @xmath44-dropouts have resulted in some candidates as well as yielding some useful upper limits on the bright end of the @xmath16 lf @xcite .",
    "galaxies at both times stand to undergo substantial improvements as the result of future and ongoing programs .",
    "of course , for truly substantial gains in this area , we will need to wait for the availability of high resolution , high sensitivity space - based imagers , such as wfc3 or nircam ( jwst ) ."
