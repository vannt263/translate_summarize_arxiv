    "this paper presents a study of attractors for a two - phase stefan problem with kinetics .",
    "we show that classical solutions of the problem approach a compact connected attractor in the uniform norm .",
    "we also demonstrate via direct numerical simulations that the attractor has a finite correlation dimension .    the free - boundary problem that is",
    "the subject of the paper  arises naturally as a mathematical model of a variety of exothermic phase transition type processes , such as solid combustion @xcite also known as self - propagating high - temperature synthesis or shs @xcite ,   solidification with undercooling @xcite , laser induced evaporation @xcite , rapid crystallization in thin films @xcite etc .",
    "these processes are characterized by production of heat at the interface , and their dynamics is determined by the feedback mechanism between the heat release due to the kinetics and the heat dissipation by the medium .",
    "in addition to its theoretical interest shs has industrial applications as a method of synthesizing certain technologically advanced materials for high - temperature semiconductors , nuclear safety devices , fuel cells etc . , see @xcite , @xcite and also @xcite for a popular exposition .",
    "shs propagates through mixtures of fine elemental reactant powders ( e.g. , ti + c , ti + 2b ) , resulting in the synthesis of compounds .",
    "there is a substantial literature that treats analytical aspects of the initial ",
    "boundary value problem for different sharp - interface models with kinetics  related to the problem ( [ he]-[jc ] ) below , see @xcite .",
    "these works are concerned with basic issues of mostly local in time existence .",
    "see also @xcite where a",
    "_ finite interval _ version of the problem with linear kinetics and the asymptotic behavior when a kinetic parameter tends to zero are discussed .",
    "dynamics on an semi - infinite spatial interrval for a one - phase model are investigated in @xcite .",
    "the principal result of this paper is asymptotics for the position of the front @xmath0 of the form @xmath1 for @xmath2 @xmath3 , where @xmath4 or @xmath5 , depending on the value of undercooling .",
    "needless to say that these asymptotics , being important on their own right , can not capture order one variations in the temperature profile and velocity . these variations , their compact structure and presumably low hausdorff dimension are the subject of our work ( the graph of the time history of solutions in fig .",
    "1 below gives some idea about their complexity ) .",
    "we also note recent papers by brauner _",
    "et al . , _",
    "@xcite-@xcite , which study dynamical behavior of solutions of a related problem .",
    "in particular they consider perturbations of traveling - wave initial data and investigate their instability and bifurcations .",
    "the objective of our work is to investigate asymptotic behavior of a propagating front . a variety of complex asymptotic dynamics ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) arise only in the context of a infinite spatial interval .",
    "this necessarily calls for a problem on an _ infinite _ spatial domain , note that for a bounded domain the flame front reaches the external boundary in finite time and extinguishes .",
    "it is important to realize that the image of a ball under the evolution is not compact for any finite time__. _ _ the potential theory computations in sec . _",
    "_  _ _ 3 - 4 allow us to extract the part of the evolution that compactifies ( the contribution from the free interface ) , while the heat losses force the contribution from the initial conditions decay with time exponentially .",
    "we believe that this clear structure of the attractor indicates that careful potential theory estimates are unavoidable if one is to study asymptotic patterns and prove existence of a compact attractor in our case .",
    "this study is partially motivated by numerical simulations and in particular by the numerical experiments described in @xcite , where it was demonstrated that the system generates a remarkable variety of complex thermokinetic oscillations .",
    "the dynamical patterns exhibited by the system , as the governing parameters are varied , include a hopf bifurcation ( see the rigorous proof @xcite ) , period doubling cascades leading to chaotic pulsations , a shilnikov - hopf bifurcation etc .",
    "these patterns are well - known for the finite - dimensional dynamical systems and hint at the possibility that the essential dynamics of the free - interface problem may be finite - dimensional as well .    at the same time , in @xcite we demonstrated that a @xmath6  system of odes obtained as a pseudo - spectral approximation to the _ one - phase _ free - boundary problem exhibits dynamics that mimics that of the infinite - dimensional system to a surprising degree .",
    "for the one - phase problem we  were able to prove that compactness and finite dimensionality of the attractor  do take place @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the _ two - phase _ problem is somewhat more physically sound than its one - phase counterpart and appears in various applications .",
    "however , the methods of the papers dealing with the one - phase problem are not directly applicable to the two - phase stefan problem with kinetics which is the subject of the present communication .",
    "this is due to the additional  temperature field behind the propagating interface ( in the product phase ) being not easily controllable .",
    "we overcome this difficulty in the present paper and show that the temperature behind the interface is sufficiently well - behaved to render compactness of the attractor .",
    "having proved compactness one is naturally curious as to how  large  is the attractor in terms of some appropriate measure .",
    "currently we are not able to answer this question analytically due to , as we believe , purely technical difficulties although we have little doubt that the dimension is finite for the two - phase case . as the measure of complexity of the attractor and therefore of the asymptotic regime , we use the correlation dimension introduced by grassberger and procaccia ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the correlation dimension is based on the idea that if the evolution can be described by a finite number of degrees of freedom then the time series of observations on the system should be spatially correlated .",
    "this spatial correlation is measured by the corellation sum , which is directly related to the integral of the standard pair correlation function @xmath7 : @xmath8 if  the dimension is @xmath9 then it is easy to see that @xmath10 for small @xmath11 .",
    "we compute the correlation dimension of the attractors generated in the direct numerical simulation of the problem .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2 we state the free - boundary problem and present some minimal background information on local existence and uniqueness .",
    "sec .  3 and 4 constitute an analytical core of the paper .",
    "here we employ the single - layer representation for the solution to obtain a natural decomposition of the solution into two contributions , one from the initial conditions , and another one from the free boundary .",
    "we obtain certain potential theory based estimates for both contributions to the solution and its spatial derivative , which are instrumental for the proof of compactness in sec .",
    "the estimates are proved to be uniform with respect to the sup norm of initial data , assuming that the nonlinearity in the kinetic free - boundary condition satisfies some natural requirements .    in sec .",
    "5 we utilize the estimates that show that the contributions from the free boundary are uniformly bounded and decay at infinity .",
    "together with the uniform bound on the spatial derivative , they allow us to apply a version of the arzela - ascoli theorem , which guarantees that the contributions from the free boundary for initial data from a fixed ball form a precompact set .",
    "we complete the proof of existence of a compact attractor by using an appropriate abstract result from dynamical systems .",
    "finally in sec .  6 , from direct numerical simulations of the free - interface problem we estimate the correlation dimension of the attractor .",
    "we study the following free boundary problem : find @xmath0 and @xmath12 such that @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15=v(t)\\quad \\mathrm{for}\\,t>0 ,   \\label{kc}\\ ] ] @xmath16:=u_{x}^{+}(s(t),t)-u_{x}^{-}(s(t),t)=v(t)\\quad   \\mathrm{for}\\,\\ t>0 ,   \\label{jc}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the interface velocity , @xmath18 is its position , @xmath19 is the temperature , and the derivatives @xmath20 and @xmath21 are taken from right side and left side of the free interface respectively . the last term in the heat equation ( [ he ] ) is due to the heat losses into the medium surrounding the combustible or solidifying substance via newton s cooling law with a non - dimensional coefficient @xmath22 .",
    "the surrounding matter is assumed to be at the temperature of the fresh combustible mixture at @xmath23 ( the original phase in the phase transition interpretation ) . by the same token",
    "the heat loss will reduce the temperature in the product phase to that of the medium .",
    "thus the behavior of the solution at infinity should satisfy @xmath24 .",
    "it should be remarked that the presence of the heat losses @xmath25 only improves the analytical properties of the solutions .",
    "for @xmath26 the boundary condition at @xmath27 should be replaced by convergence to a constant .",
    "the dynamics of the physical system are determined by the feedback mechanism between the heat release due to the kinetics @xmath28  and the heat dissipation by the medium . to illustrate the meaning of the kinetic term ,",
    "for example , in the context of solidification , we note that for some substances in the presence of strong supercooling of the original phase the phase transition temperature measured at the interface may deviate considerably from the equilibrium one and is functionally related to the interface velocity .",
    "this dependence called the interface attachment kinetics can be different for different substances due to various microscopic mechanisms responsible for the incorporation of the product at the interface into the crystalline lattice .",
    "the second interface condition ( [ jc ] ) ( the stefan boundary condition ) expresses the balance between the heat produced at the free boundary and its diffusion by the adjacent medium . as the problem describes propagation of the phase transition front , the first interface condition ( [ kc ] )",
    "is a manifestation of the _ nonequilibrium _ nature of the transition ; its analog for the classical stefan problem is just @xmath29  we should mention that in contrast with the nonequilibrium problem , the dynamics of the classical stefan problem is relatively trivial .    to discuss properties of the attracting set for classical solutions of the free interface problem ( [ he])-([jc ] ) we need to first establish their existence and uniqueness for all times .",
    "we say that @xmath30 form a _ classical solution _ of ( [ he])-([jc ] ) if    \\(i ) @xmath12 and @xmath17 are continuous for @xmath31 ;    \\(ii ) @xmath32 and @xmath33 are continuous for @xmath34 ;    \\(iii ) equations ( [ he])-([jc ] ) are satisfied .",
    "we quote the result as it was stated in @xcite :    suppose that the kinetic functions @xmath35 satisfies the following assumptions:@xmath36 @xmath37 is a continuously differentiable , monotone decreasing , negative function on @xmath38 with @xmath39 for some velocity @xmath40@xmath41 @xmath42 is sublinear : @xmath43 and that the initial data @xmath44  are bounded .",
    "then there exists one and only one classical solution @xmath45 and @xmath17 of the free interface problem ( [ he])-([jc ] ) .",
    "the solution is uniformly bounded for all @xmath46 .    for the reader s convenience we outline the scheme of the proof .",
    "first , the problem is reduced to an integral equation for the interface velocity using the single layer potential representation : @xmath47 where @xmath48^{-1/2}\\ ] ] is the heat kernel and @xmath18 .",
    "taking the limit of ( [ iu ] ) as @xmath49 and using the kinetics condition ( [ kc ] ) , we obtain an integral equation in terms of @xmath50 only :    @xmath51    next , we show that for sufficiently small time intervals , the mapping @xmath52 defined by the right hand side of the integral equation @xmath53 : = kv\\ ] ] defines a contraction on an appropriately chosen closed set of continuous functions which yields local existence .",
    "we also remark that the velocity @xmath54 can be shown to be an infinitely differentiable function .",
    "the centerpiece of the global existence proof is the _ a priori _ estimate , which allows us to extend the local solution indefinitely .",
    "in order to demonstrate existence of an absorbing set we need to establish spatial decay of the interface contribution to the classical solutions of the problem . first we obtain an estimate for the solution on the interface .",
    "let @xmath30 be a classical solution of ( [ he])-([jc ] ) and @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57  are constants dependent solely on the kinetic function @xmath58    first we prove the estimate for the interface temperature : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the two parts of the right hand side of ( [ ie ] ) .",
    "it is rather obvious that @xmath62 : @xmath63    now , since the kinetic function satisfies the condition ( a2 ) , for any @xmath64 there exists @xmath65 such that @xmath66 if @xmath67 we subdivide @xmath61 as follows : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    for @xmath71we",

    "we consider a discreet approximation of the solution in the space @xmath202 by sampling the solution at @xmath203 points @xmath204 .",
    "we measure the spatial correlation between the points on the discreet approximation of the attractor with the correlation integral @xmath205 if for small @xmath206 @xmath207  scales as @xmath208 then the correlation exponent @xmath9  can be taken as the correlation dimension of the attractor @xmath209 for practical calculations the frequency of sampling @xmath210 , the number @xmath211 of points in space where the solution is sampled at each time , and the number of samples @xmath212 are determined empirically .",
    "similarly , for the low sample dimension @xmath203  a better approximation for @xmath213 may be obtained if the euclidean distance @xmath214  is modified by inclusion of a weight .    to obtain a numerical approximation of the attractors we solve the initial value problem ( [ he])-([jc ] ) for sufficiently large time until the asymptotic regime is attained .",
    "obviously the dimension of the attractor should not depend on the choice of initial data , which was confirmed by direct numerical simulations .",
    "problem ( [ he])-([jc ] ) was solved in the frame attached to the free boundary on a finite interval @xmath215 $ ] with the dirichlet conditions @xmath216 simulating the decay of the solution at @xmath217 and @xmath218 corresponding to the stabilization of the temperature in the product phase . according to our observations",
    "the results are practically insensitive to the increase in the interval length after @xmath219 ( see @xcite for the details of the numerical algorithm ) .",
    "we remark that in contrast with the one - phase case where @xmath220  was sufficient , one needs a rather large spatial domain to obtain consistent numerical results .    to represent different dynamical regimes we use the arrhenius kinetics , @xmath221 ,   \\label{arr}\\ ] ] where ( in the context of combustion ) @xmath222 is proportional to the activation energy ( zeldovich number ) , and @xmath223 is the temperature ratio of the fresh mixture and the product , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "thus , the attractor is represented as a set in @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the number of sampling points of temperature profiles .",
    "we choose time snapshots of the solution for every @xmath224 in the interval of the asymptotic regime ( @xmath225 ) and consider them as a discrete approximation of the attractor in @xmath202 .",
    "the correlation dimension for this discrete set is evaluated as explained above . as a control experiment we selected a periodic asymptotic regime ,",
    "it is immediately confirmed that @xmath227 as one should expect .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath228 @xmath229 the regime is chaotic as is illustrated in fig .  1 that presents a series of snapshots of spatial temperature profiles .",
    "one can see from the log - log graph of the correlation integral ( fig .",
    "2 ) that in this case @xmath230 . from our observations on a variety of regimes",
    "it appears that the dimension can not be much higher than @xmath231 .",
    "the compactness result has been proved here in the presence of heat losses for any nonzero heat loss . although we chose to operate in spaces of continuous uniformly bounded functions on the infinite interval , we are convinced that compactness can be established even for zero heat loss if spaces with weaker topology are used , for instance in the space of continuous functions bounded on each finite interval .",
    "results of this paper have been proved for the kinetic function satisfying the bounds in ( [ kinetics ] ) .",
    "these bounds are quite physical and cover a wide range of important applications .",
    "nonetheless , our numerical experimentation with different types of kinetic functions , including unbounded ones demonstrate that the asymptotic dynamics are insensitive to the behavior of the kinetic function for large temperatures . on the other hand , our results from @xcite",
    "provide global existence and uniform boundedness of solutions for a wider class of kinetic functions , namely for sublinear kinetics .",
    "therefore we strongly believe that the principal result of this paper holds for this case as well .",
    "it is interesting to compare the proof of the compactness above to that for the one - phase problem @xcite .",
    "although the estimates in the two - phase case are more involved due to the presence of the temperature field behind the propagating interface , once they are obtained , the representation of the evolution semigroup is more transparent than in the one - phase case .",
    "also , it is rather remarkable that the numerical estimates for the correlation dimension of the attractor above and for the one - phase case ( see @xcite ) yield roughly the same value .",
    "indeed , such an outcome is rather unexpected because the two - phase problem seems to possess more  degrees of freedom  than its one - phase counterpart .    finally , for the one - phase problem we  have been able to prove that the hausdorff dimension of the attractor  is finite @xcite .",
    "currently we are not able to overcome certain difficulties that we believe are of purely technical nature but it appears safe to conjecture that the dimension of the attractor is finite for the two - phase problem as well .",
