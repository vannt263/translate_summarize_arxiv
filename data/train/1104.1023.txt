    "linear programming based methods and polyhedral theory form the backbone of large parts of combinatorial optimization .",
    "the basic paradigm here is to identify the feasible solutions to a given problem with some vectors in such a way that the optimization problem becomes the problem of optimizing a linear function over the finite set  @xmath0 of these vectors .",
    "the optimal value of a linear function over  @xmath0 is equal to its optimal value over the convex hull  @xmath1 of  @xmath0 . according to the weyl ",
    "minkowski theorem  @xcite , every _ polytope _",
    "( i.e. , the convex hull of a finite set of vectors ) can be written as the set of solutions to a system of linear equations and inequalities .",
    "thus one ends up with a linear programming problem .    as for the maybe most classical example , let us consider the set @xmath2 of all matchings in the complete graph @xmath3 on  @xmath4 nodes ( where a matching is a subset of edges no two of which share a common end - node ) . identifying every matching @xmath5 with its characteristic vector @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 if and only if @xmath8 ) , we obtain the _ matching polytope _ @xmath9 in one of his seminal papers , edmonds  @xcite proved that @xmath10 equals the set of all @xmath11 that satisfy the inequalities @xmath12 for all @xmath13 and @xmath14 for all subsets @xmath15 of _ odd _ cardinality @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the set of all edges incident to  @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the set of all edges with both end - nodes in  @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ) .",
    "no inequality in this system , whose size is exponential in  @xmath4 , is redundant .",
    "the situation is quite similar for the _ permutahedron _",
    "@xmath22 , i.e. , the convex hull of all vectors that arise from permuting the components of @xmath23 .",

    "however if for each permutation @xmath29}\\rightarrow{[{n}]}$ ] we consider the corresponding _ permutation matrix _",
    "@xmath30 ( satisfying @xmath31 if and only if @xmath32 ) rather than the vector @xmath33 , we obtain a much smaller description of the resulting polytope , since , according to birkhoff  @xcite and von neumann  @xcite , the convex hull  @xmath34 ( the _ birkhoff - polytope _ ) of all @xmath35-permutation matrices is equal to the set of all _ doubly - stochastic _ @xmath35-matrices ( i.e. , nonnegative @xmath35-matrices all of whose row- and column sums are equal to one ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the permutahedron  @xmath22 is a linear projection of the birkhoff - polytope  @xmath34 via the map defined by @xmath36 .",
    "since , for every linear objective function vector @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 , one can use  @xmath34 ( that can be described by the @xmath39 nonnegativity - inequalities ) instead of  @xmath22 ( whose description requires @xmath28 inequalities ) with respect to linear programming related issues .",
    "in general , an _ extension _ of a polytope  @xmath40 is a polyhedron  @xmath41 ( i.e. , an intersection of finitely many affine hyperplanes and halfspaces ) together with a linear projection @xmath42 satisfying @xmath43 .",
    "any description of  @xmath44 by linear equations and linear inequalities then ( together with  @xmath45 ) is an _ extended formulation _ of  @xmath46 .",
    "the _ size _ of the extended formulation is the number of inequalities in the description .",
    "note that we neither account for the number of equations ( we can get rid of them by eliminating variables ) nor for the number of variables ( we can ensure that there are not more variables than inequalities by projecting  @xmath44 to the orthogonal complement of its _ lineality space _",
    ", where the latter is the space of all directions of lines contained in  @xmath44 ) .",
    "if  @xmath47 is the matrix with @xmath48 , then , for every @xmath37 , we have @xmath49 .",
    "in the example described above , @xmath34 thus provides an extended formulation of  @xmath22 of size  @xmath39 .",
    "it is not known whether one can do something similar for the matching polytopes  @xmath10 ( we will be back to this question in section  [ subsec : symm ] ) .",
    "however there are many other examples of nice and small extended formulations for polytopes associated with combinatorial optimization problems .",
    "the aim of this article ( that has appeared in  @xcite ) is to show a few of them and to shed some light on the geometric , combinatorial and algebraic background of this concept that recently has received increased attention .",
    "the presentation is not meant to be a survey ( for this purpose , we refer to vanderbeck and wolsey  @xcite as well as to cornujols , conforti , and zambelli  @xcite ) but rather an appetizer for investigating alternative possibilities to express combinatorial optimization problems by means of linear programs .    while we will not be concerned with practical aspects here , extended formulations",
    "have also proven to be useful in computations .",
    "you can find more on this in laurence wolsey s discussion column in  @xcite .",
    "fundamental work with respect to understanding the concept of extended formulations and its limits has been done by mihalis yannakakis in his 1991-paper _ expressing combinatorial optimization problems by linear programs _",
    "@xcite ( see sect .  [ subsec : positiverank ] and  [ sec : fundlims ] ) .",
    "he discusses some of his thoughts on the subject in another discussion column in  @xcite .",
    "the _ spanning tree polytope _  @xmath50 associated with the complete graph @xmath3 on  @xmath4 nodes is the convex hull of all characteristic vectors of spanning trees , i.e. , of all subsets of edges that form connected and cycle - free subgraphs . in another seminal paper ,",
    "edmonds  @xcite proved that  @xmath50 is the set of all @xmath11 that satisfy the equation @xmath51 and the inequalities @xmath52 for all @xmath15 with @xmath53 . again , none of the exponentially many inequalities is redundant .",
    "however , by introducing additional variables @xmath54 for all ordered triples @xmath55 of pairwise different nodes meant to encode whether the edge  @xmath56 is contained in the tree and  @xmath57 is in the component of  @xmath58 when removing  @xmath56 from the tree , it turns out that the system consisting of the equations @xmath59 and @xmath60}\\setminus\\{v , w\\}}z_{v , u , w } = 1 $ ] ( for all pairwise different @xmath61 ) along with the nonnegativity constraints and the equation @xmath51 provides an extended formulation of  @xmath50 of size  @xmath62 ( with orthogonal projection to the space of @xmath63-variables ) .",
    "this formulation is due to martin  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "you will find an alternative one in laurence wolsey s discussion column below .",
    "if @xmath64 is a polytope for each @xmath65}$ ] , then clearly @xmath66 is a polytope as well , but , in general , it is difficult to derive a description by linear equations and inequalities in  @xmath67 from such descriptions of the polytopes  @xmath68 .",
    "however constructing an extended formulation for  @xmath46 in this situation is very simple .",
    "indeed suppose that each  @xmath68 is described by a system @xmath69 of  @xmath70 linear inequalities ( where , in order to simplify notation , we assume that equations are written , e.g. , as pairs of inequalities ) .",
    "then the system @xmath71 for all @xmath65}$ ] , @xmath72 , @xmath73 with variables @xmath74 for all @xmath65}$ ] and @xmath75 is an extended formulation for  @xmath46 of size @xmath76 , where the projection is given by @xmath77 .",
    "this has been proved first by balas ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , even for polyhedra that are not necessarily polytopes ( where in this general case  @xmath46 needs to be defined as the topological closure of the convex hull of the union ) .",
    "when a combinatorial optimization problem can be solved by a dynamic programming algorithm , one often can derive an extended formulation for the associated polytope whose size is roughly bounded by the running time of the algorithm .",
    "a simple example is the 0/1-knapsack problem , where we are given a nonnegative integral weight vector @xmath78 , a weight bound  @xmath79 , and a profit vector @xmath37 , and the task is to solve @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "a classical dynamic programming algorithm works by setting up an acyclic directed graph with nodes  @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 for all @xmath85}$ ] , @xmath86 and arcs from @xmath84 to @xmath87 if and only if @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where such an arc would be assigned length  @xmath90 , as well as arcs from all nodes to  @xmath83 ( of length zero ) . then solving the 0/1-knapsack problem is equivalent to finding a longest @xmath91-@xmath83-path in this acyclic directed network , which can be carried out in linear time in the number  @xmath92 of arcs .",
    "the polyhedron  @xmath93 of all @xmath91-@xmath83-flows of value one in that network equals the convex hull of all characteristic vectors of @xmath91-@xmath83-paths ( due to the total unimodularity of the node - arc incidence matrix ) , thus it is easily seen to be mapped to the associated _ knapsack - polytope _ @xmath94 via the projection given by @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the sum of all components of  @xmath97 indexed by arcs pointing to nodes of type @xmath98 .",
    "as  @xmath44 is described by nonnegativity constraints , the flow - conservation equations on the nodes different from  @xmath91 and  @xmath83 and the equation ensuring an outflow of value one from  @xmath91 , these constraints provide an extended formulation for @xmath99 of size  @xmath92 .",
    "however quite often dynamic programming algorithms can only be formulated as longest - paths problems in acyclic directed _ _ hyper__graphs with hyperarcs of the type  @xmath100 ( with a subset  @xmath20 of nodes ) whose usage in the path represents the fact that the optimal solution to the partial problem represented by node  @xmath18 has been constructed from the optimal solutions to the partial problems represented by the set  @xmath20 .",
    "martin , rardin , and campbell  @xcite showed that , under the condition that one can assign appropriate _",
    "reference sets _ to the nodes , also in this more general situation nonnegativity constraints and flow - equations suffice to describe the convex hull of the characteristic vectors of the hyperpaths .",
    "this generalization allows one to derive polynomial size extended formulations for many of the combinatorial optimization problems that can be solved in polynomial time by dynamic programming algorithms .      a common generalization of the techniques to construct extended formulations by means of disjunctive programming or dynamic programming is provided by _ branched polyhedral systems _ ( _ bps _ )  @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "one starts from an acyclic directed graph that has associated with each of its non - sink nodes  @xmath18 a polyhedron in the space indexed by the out - neighbors of  @xmath18 . from these building blocks , one constructs a polyhedron in the space indexed by all nodes . under certain conditions",
    "one can derive an extended formulation for the constructed polyhedron from extended formulations of the polyhedra associated with the nodes .",
    "some very nice extended formulations have recently been given by faenza , oriolo , and stauffer  @xcite for stable set polytopes of claw - free graphs . here the crucial step is to glue together descriptions of stable set polytopes of certain building block graphs by means of _ strip compositions_. one of their constructions can be obtained by applying the bps - framework , though apparently the most interesting one they have can not .",
    "an asymptotically smallest possible extended formulation of size @xmath101 for the permutahedron  @xmath22 has been found by goemans  @xcite .",
    "his construction relies on the existence of _ sorting networks _ of size @xmath102 ( ajtai , komls , and szemerdi  @xcite ) , i.e. , sequences @xmath103 for which the algorithm that in each step  @xmath91 swaps elements  @xmath104 and  @xmath105 if and only if @xmath106 sorts every sequence @xmath107 into non - decreasing order .",
    "the construction principle of goemans has been generalized to the framework of _ reflection relations _",
    "@xcite , which , for instance , can be used to obtain small extended formulations for all _ @xmath108-permutahedra of finite reflection groups  @xmath108 _ ( see , e.g. , humphreys  @xcite ) , including extended formulations of size @xmath109 of regular  @xmath110-gons , previously constructed by ben - tal and nemirovski  @xcite .",
    "another application of reflection relations yields extended formulations of size @xmath101 for _ huffman - polytopes _ ,",
    "i.e. , the convex hulls of the leaves - to - root - distances vectors in rooted binary trees with  @xmath4 labelled leaves .",
    "note that linear descriptions of these polytopes in the original spaces are very large , rather complicated , and unknown ( see nguyen , nguyen , and maurras  @xcite ) .",
    "the list of combinatorial problems for which small ( and nice ) extended formulations have been found comprises many others , among them perfect matching polytopes of planar graphs ( barahona  @xcite ) , perfectly matchable subgraph polytopes of bipartite graphs ( balas and pulleyblank  @xcite ) , stable - set polytopes of distance claw - free graphs ( pulleyblank and shepherd  @xcite ) , packing and partitioning orbitopes  @xcite , subtour - elimination polytopes ( yannakakis  @xcite and , for planar graphs , rivin  @xcite , cheung  @xcite ) , and certain mixed - integer programs ( see , e.g. , conforti , di summa , eisenbrand , and wolsey  @xcite ) .",

    "in particular , we have derived the following result that essentially is due to yannakakis  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . here , the _ nonnegative rank _ of a matrix is the minumum number  @xmath165 such that the matrix can be written as a product of two nonnegative matrices , where the first one has  @xmath165 columns and the second one has  @xmath165 rows .",

    "there is also quite some interest in the _ nonnegative _ rank of ( not necessarily slack ) matrices in general ( see , e.g. , cohen and rothblum  @xcite ) .",
    "every extension  @xmath44 of a polytope  @xmath46 has at least as many faces as  @xmath46 , as the face lattice of  @xmath46 can be embedded into the face lattice of  @xmath44 ( see sect .",

    "since each face is the intersection of some facets , one finds that the extension complexity of a polyhedron with  @xmath167 faces is at least @xmath168 ( the binary logarithm of  @xmath167 ) .",
    "this observation has first been made by goemans  @xcite in order to argue that the extension complexity of the permutahedron  @xmath22 is at least @xmath169 .",
    "suppose that @xmath160 is a factorization of a slack matrix  @xmath157 of the polytope  @xmath46 into nonnegative matrices  @xmath151 and  @xmath20 with columns @xmath170 and rows @xmath171 , respectively .",
    "then we can write @xmath172 as the sum of  @xmath165 nonnegative matrices of rank one .",
    "calling the set of all non - zero positions of a matrix its _ support _ , we thus find that the nonnegative factorization @xmath160 provides a way to cover the support of  @xmath157 by  @xmath165 _ rectangles _ , i.e. , sets of the form @xmath173 , where  @xmath174 and  @xmath175 are subsets of the row- and column - indices of  @xmath157 , respectively .",
    "hence , due to theorem  [ thm : extcomplnonnegrk ] , the minimum number of rectangles by which one can cover the support of  @xmath157 yields a lower bound ( the _ rectangle covering bound _ ) on the extension complexity of  @xmath46 ( yannakakis  @xcite ) .",
    "actually , the rectangle covering bound dominates the bound discussed in the previous paragraph  @xcite . as yannakakis",
    "@xcite observed furthermore , the logarithm of the rectangle covering bound of a polytope  @xmath46 is equal to the _ nondeterministic communication complexity _ ( see , e.g. , the book of kushilevitz and nisan  @xcite ) of the predicate on the pairs @xmath176 of vertices  @xmath18 and facets  @xmath165 of  @xmath46 that is true if and only if  @xmath177 .",
    "one can equivalently describe the rectangle covering bound as the minimum number of complete bipartite subgraphs needed to cover the _ vertex - facet - non - incidence graph _ of the polytope  @xmath46 .",
    "fooling set _ is a subset  @xmath178 of the edges of this graph such that no two of the edges in  @xmath178 are contained in a complete bipartite subgraph .",
    "thus every fooling set  @xmath178 proves that the rectangle covering bound , and hence , the extension complexity of  @xmath46 , is at least  @xmath179 .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath4-dimensional cube it is not too difficult to come up with a fooling set of size  @xmath180 , proving that for a cube one can not do better by allowing extended formulations for the representation . for more details on bounds of this type",
    "we refer to  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , all in all the currently known techniques for deriving lower bounds on extension complexities are rather limited and yield mostly quite unsatisfying bounds .      asking , for instance , about the extension complexity of the matching polytope @xmath10 defined in the beginning",
    ", one finds that not much is known",
    ". it might be anything between quadratic and exponential in  @xmath4 .",
    "however , in the main part of his striking paper  @xcite , yannakakis established an exponential lower bound on the sizes of _ symmetric _ extended formulations of  @xmath10 . here , _ symmetric _",
    "means that the extension polyhedron remains unchanged when renumbering the nodes of the complete graph , or more formally that , for each permutation  @xmath181 of the edges of the complete graph that is induced by a permutation of its nodes , there is a permutation  @xmath182 of the variables of the extended formulation that maps the extension polyhedron to itself such that , for every vector  @xmath97 in the extended space , applying  @xmath181 to the projection of  @xmath97 yields the same vector as projecting the vector obtained from  @xmath97 by applying  @xmath182 .",
    "indeed , many extended formulations are symmetric in a similar way , for instance the extended formulation of the permutahedron by the birkhoff - polytope mentioned in the introduction as well as the extended formulation for the spanning tree polytope discussed in section  [ subsec : spt ] .    in order to state yannakakis result more precisely , denote by  @xmath183 the set of all matchings of cardinality  @xmath184 in the complete graph with  @xmath4 nodes , and by @xmath185 the associated polytope .",

    "yannakakis constructs a section  @xmath91 for  @xmath191 for that he can show  by exploiting bochert s theorem  that there is a nonnegative matrix  @xmath208 with @xmath209 for all @xmath210 , which makes it rather straight forward to construct  @xmath192 from  @xmath191 .    with respect to the fact that his proof yields an exponential lower bound only for _ symmetric _ extended formulations , yannakakis  @xcite remarked `` we do not think that asymmetry helps much '' in constructing small extended formulations of the ( perfect ) matching polytopes and stated as an open problem to `` prove that the matching (  ) polytopes can not be expressed by polynomial size lp s without the symmetry assumption '' . as indicated above , today we still do not know whether this is possible .",
    "however , at least it turned out recently that requiring symmetry can make a big difference for the smallest possible size of an extended formulation .",
    "[ thm : kpt ] all symmetric extended formulations of  @xmath211 have size at least @xmath212 , while there are polynomial size non - symmetric extended formulations for  @xmath211 ( i.e. , the extension complexity of  @xmath211 is bounded from above by a polynomial in  @xmath4 ) .",
    "thus , at least when considering matchings of size @xmath213 instead of perfect ( or arbitrary ) matchings , asymmetry indeed helps much .    while the proof of the lower bound on the sizes of symmetric extended formulations stated in theorem  [ thm : kpt ] is a modification of yannakakis proof indicated above , the construction of the polynomial size non",
    "- symmetric extended formulation of @xmath211 relies on the principle of disjunctive programming ( see section  [ subsec : disprg ] ) . for an arbitrary coloring  @xmath214 of the  @xmath4 nodes of the complete graph with  @xmath215 colors , we call a matching  @xmath216 ( with @xmath217 ) _ @xmath214-colorful _ if , in each of the  @xmath215 color classes , there is exactly one node that is an end - node of one of the edges from  @xmath216 .",
    "let us denote by  @xmath218 the convex hull of the characteristic vectors of @xmath214-colorful matchings .",
    "the crucial observation is that  @xmath218 can be described by @xmath219 inequalities ( as opposed to  @xmath220 inequalities needed to describe the polytope associated with all matchings , see the introduction ) . on the other hand , according to a theorem due to alon , yuster , and zwick  @xcite , there is a family of  @xmath143 such colorings @xmath221 with @xmath222 such that , for every @xmath215-element subset  @xmath223 of the  @xmath4 nodes , in at least one of the colorings the nodes from  @xmath223 receive pairwise different colors .",
    "thus we have @xmath224 , and hence ( as described in section  [ subsec : disprg ] ) we obtain an extended formulation of  @xmath225 of size @xmath226 , which , for @xmath227 , yields the upper bound in theorem  [ thm : kpt ] .",
    "yannakakis  @xcite moreover deduced from theorem  [ thm : yanlbsym ] that there are no polynomial size symmetric extended formulations for the traveling salesman polytope ( the convex hull of the characteristic vectors of all cycles of lengths  @xmath4 in the complete graph with  @xmath4 nodes ) .",
    "similarly to theorem  [ thm : kpt ] , one can also prove that there are no polynomial size symmetric extended formulations for the polytopes associated with cycles of length  @xmath213 , while these polytopes nevertheless have polynomially bounded extension complexity  @xcite .",
    "pashkovich  @xcite further extended yannakakis techniques in order to prove that every symmetric extended formulation of the permutahedron  @xmath22 has size at least  @xmath228 , showing that the birkhoff - polytope essentially provides an optimal _ symmetric _ extension for the permutahedron .",
    "many polytopes associated with combinatorial optimization problems can be represented in small , simple , and nice ways as projections of higher dimensional polyhedra . moreover , though we have not touched this topic here , sometimes such extended formulations are also very helpful in deriving descriptions in the original spaces .",
    "what we currently lack are on the one hand more techniques to construct extended formulations and on the other hand a good understanding of the fundamental limits of such representations .",
    "for instance , does every polynomially solvable combinatorial optimization problem admit an extended formulation of polynomial size ? we even do not know this for the matching problem .",
    "how about the stable set problem in perfect graphs ?",
    "the best upper bound on the extension complexity of these polytopes for graphs with  @xmath4 nodes still is  @xmath229 ( yannakakis  @xcite ) .",
    "progress on such questions will eventually shed more light onto the principle possiblities to express combinatorial problems by means of linear constraints .",
    "moreover , the search for extended formulations yields new modelling ideas some of which may prove to be useful also in practical contexts . in any case ,",
