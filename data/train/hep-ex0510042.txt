    "in recent years , precise new results in low - energy hadronic cross sections have been obtained at high - luminosity @xmath0machines using the radiative return technique .",
    "the cross section for @xmath6 has been measured by the kloe collaboration  @xcite , while those of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 have been measured by babar  @xcite .",
    "these measurements are of particular interest since they provide input to data - driven calculations of hadronic contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath11 , and of the running of the qed coupling constant @xmath12 , which appears in global fits to the standard model . as a continuation of this program ,",
    "preliminary babar measurements for the @xmath13 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 final states are presented here .",
    "the @xmath13and six - hadron results are based on @xmath14 and @xmath15 of data respectively .",
    "the radiative return method uses the emission of an initial - state photon to probe center - of - mass energies @xmath16 below the nominal collision energy @xmath17 .",
    "the emission of a photon of energy @xmath18 in the center - of - mass frame corresponds to the production of a recoiling system with @xmath19 .",
    "cross - section measurements can therefore be obtained over a wide range of center - of - mass energies without varying the beam energy , thereby avoiding the usual point - to - point uncertainties associated with discrete measurements .    at babar the range",
    "@xmath20 is readily accessible . to reduce backgrounds ,",
    "events are reconstructed by requiring the isr photon to be detected within the acceptance of the babar electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "since the recoiling system is produced as a jet opposite the high - energy photon , the event detection efficiency is only weakly dependent on @xmath16 , and measurements down to threshold are possible .",
    "the efficiency also does not depend strongly on the simulation of the hadronic final state .    at first order",
    "the cross section for an isr process with a photon polar angle acceptance of @xmath21 in the center - of - mass frame is    @xmath22    where @xmath23 .",
    "a kinematic fit is used to measure @xmath24 and reject backgrounds .",
    "cross sections are normalized using the process @xmath25 .",
    "the cross section for @xmath26 is given by     distributions for the mass bins @xmath27 { \\ensuremath{{\\mathrm{\\,ge\\kern -0.1em v\\!/}c^2}}\\xspace}$ ] ( a ) and @xmath28 { \\ensuremath{{\\mathrm{\\,ge\\kern -0.1em v\\!/}c^2}}\\xspace}$ ] ( b ) .",
    "the dashed ( dot - dashed ) curve shows the contribution from the simulated @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) cross section term ; the solid line is the sum of the two terms and the points correspond to data .",

    "the factor @xmath36 accounts for coulomb interaction in the @xmath13system and has the effect of making the cross section non - zero at threshold .",
    "the detection efficiency for the isr process is about @xmath37 , with no strong dependence on either the @xmath13invariant mass @xmath38 or the value of @xmath31 .",
    "the proton helicity angle @xmath39 in the @xmath13rest frame can be used to separate the @xmath30 and @xmath29 terms .",
    "their respective variations are approximately @xmath40 and @xmath41 , with exact expressions obtained from monte - carlo simulation . by fitting the @xmath42 distribution to a sum of the two terms",
    "the ratio @xmath31 can be extracted .",
    "this is done separately in six bins of @xmath38 .",
    "preliminary results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gegm ] , and disagree significantly with previous measurements from lear  @xcite .",
    "the cross section for @xmath26 is measured and from it we obtain the `` effective form factor '' @xmath43 .",
    "preliminary values are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : xsplots](a ) and [ fig : xsplots](b ) .",
    "results are good agreement with existing data , and cover the entire energy range from threshold to @xmath44 in a single measurement .",
    "the data show a clear enhancement at threshold , already observed by lear , as well as hints of structures at @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "apart from these structures , the data agree well with a fit to the perturbative qcd expectation  @xcite @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are constants determined from the fit , which is shown as the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsplots](a ) .",
    "as an extension of the recent isr measurements of the cross section of final states with four pions or kaons  @xcite , preliminary results have been obtained for the six - hadron processes @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the corresponding cross section distributions are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : xsplots](c ) , [ fig : xsplots](d ) and [ fig : xsplots](e ) respectively . in the @xmath51 mode",
    "the data disagree strongly with the dm2 results above @xmath53 . apart from this",
    ", the data agrees well with existing results , and is considerably more precise .",
    "the cross section for @xmath52 is measured for the first time .",
    "again , the entire energy range from threshold to @xmath44 is covered in a single experiment .",
    "a clear dip is visible at about @xmath54 in the @xmath55 modes .",
    "a similar feature was already seen by dm2 in @xmath56 and by focus  @xcite in the diffractive photoproduction of six charged pions .",
    "the cross section distributions are fitted using the parametrization used by focus , a sum of a breit - wigner resonance shape and a jacob - slansky continuum  @xcite . for the @xmath57 ( @xmath51 ) mode",
    ", we obtain values of @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) for the resonance peak , @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) for the resonance width and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) for phase shift between the resonance and continuum .",
    "the width values differ significantly from the focus result of @xmath64 .    in the @xmath57 channel",
    "the resonance structure is surprisingly simple , being well - described by a monte - carlo simulation featuring a single @xmath65 resonance and the other four pions distributed according to phase space .",
    "however rich resonant structures are observed in the @xmath51 channel , with signals for @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the @xmath70 combinations , and signals for @xmath71 and @xmath72 in @xmath73 .",
    "a signal for @xmath74 is also seen , corresponding to a resonant structure in the @xmath55 invariant mass , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsplots](f ) .",
    "fitting the distribution to a breit - wigner shape gives a peak position of @xmath75 and a width of @xmath76 , which could correspond to the @xmath77 state reported in our previous analysis of the @xmath73 final state  @xcite .",
    "apart from this structure , which is unique to the @xmath51 mode , the ratio of the @xmath51 and @xmath57 cross sections is remarkably constant over the entire energy range , at a value of @xmath78 . in the @xmath52 final state ,",
    "a signal for @xmath79 is seen , with a significant contribution from @xmath80 .",
    "signals for @xmath81 are also present .",
    "finally , the observed @xmath82 and @xmath83 signals can be used to extract branching fraction measurements which , in many cases , considerably improve over current world averages .",
