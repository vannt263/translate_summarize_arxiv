    "i was then a graduate student at brown university , where herb fried lectured in his quantum field theory course on the bloch - nordsieck approximation and the schwinger - fradkin representation .",
    "the representation invented by fradkin first appeared in a 1966 nuclear physics article @xcite .",
    "it became the backbone of many of the eikonal articles in the years to come .",
    "the state of the art has been extensively reviewed in ref .",
    "similar methods have been adopted recently in @xcite in order to study planckian - energy gravitational scattering .",
    "i will pick up the story in 1970 , when i published a short article in phys .",
    "@xcite which is concerned with the summation of a certain subclass of feynman diagrams within the bloch - nordsieck ( or eikonal ) approximation .",
    "while this approximation was used in scalar and spinor qed at that time @xcite , it was not until 1992 that the same methods were applied again to linearized quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "now path integral techniques were en vogue and had long since overtaken functional differentiation methods as advocated by schwinger - symanzik or fradkin himself .",
    "however , in the sequel i will demonstrate within linearized quantum gravity that there is no need to go beyond the functional differentiation techniques that were already available in the sixties .",
    "at the beginning of this chapter we write down the linearized einstein - hilbert action coupled to a spin-@xmath0 matter field . after",

    "( [ 4 ] ) approximately .",
    "since we are interested in elastic forward scattering processes with the exchange of an arbitrary number of soft gravitons , we proceed to evaluate eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) using the bloch - nordsieck ( bn ) or eikonal approximation .",
    "for this reason we begin by performing a semi - fourier transform , @xmath13 in this way we obtain the following expression : @xmath14g(x , y|h ) = \\int \\frac{d^4p}{(2\\pi)^4}\\ , { \\text{e}}^{{\\text{i}}px } \\left ( { \\text{e}}^{-{\\text{i}}py } + \\frac{1}{2 }    \\gamma_\\mu h^{\\mu\\nu}(x ) p_\\nu \\ , g(p , y|h)\\right ) . \\label{6}\\ ] ] in this equation we have dropped the term @xmath15 which leads to a kind of self - coupling  the same index @xmath16 .",

    "in fact all our results would have come out by just replacing @xmath126 by @xmath127 in the original action expression and green s function equation for spin @xmath128 qed .",
    "hence the t hooft poles could have been already discovered by the end of the sixties , if one had not worried about the non - renormalizability of einstein s theory and treated it instead as an effective field theory .",

    "but this does not come as a surprise since the eikonal approximation applied to qed is likewise unable to produce the uehling potential or lamb - shift .",
    "finally we should point out that the t hooft poles originate from @xmath130 , the impact parameter , reaching all the way down to zero , and thus from the short - distance behavior of the newton interaction .",
