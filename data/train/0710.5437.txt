    "starburst galaxies , with their characteristically high star formation rates , provide the perfect environments for these winds to develop .",
    "indeed , galactic winds are ubiquitous in starburst galaxies , having been observed in many nearby galaxies and inferred in galaxies at high - redshifts ( see * ? ? ?",
    "*  and references therein )    the best studied galactic wind is the outflow in m82 , which is clearly visible in the light of h@xmath0 , displaying a vast filamentary system extending several kpc along the minor axis of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "these filaments lie on the surface of a mostly hollow structure and rotate in the same direction as the disk @xcite . as with other galactic winds",
    "( e.g. ngc 253 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the wind in m82 is asymmetric , with the northern outflow more chaotic than the southern outflow .",
    "the filaments can be traced to the nuclear region and display both shell and loop - like structures @xcite .",
    "the formation of these filaments is currently not well understood , but they are thought to be either disk or halo gas that has been entrained into the outflow",
    ".    the morphology of galactic winds can vary .",
    "outflows often display asymmetries , varying degrees of collimation and may be tilted with respect to the minor axis . while many outflows are limb - brightened ( e.g. ngc 3079 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the optical filaments can also fill the volume rather than remain confined to the surface of the biconical outflow @xcite .",
    "the host galaxy itself plays an important role in determining the morphology of a wind , with its size and structure affecting the degree of collimation @xcite and expansion of the outflow @xcite .",
    "recent chandra observations have revealed increasing detail in the x - ray emission from galactic winds .",
    "one of the most striking results of these observations is the close spatial relationship with the h@xmath0 emitting gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , suggesting a close physical connection .",
    "thus , a successful model of a galactic wind needs to explain this relationship . @xcite",
    "provide a summary of several theories for the origin of the x - ray emission that could explain this correlation .",
    "these mechanisms involve shocked disk or halo gas that has been swept up into the wind , in the form of dense clouds or shells .    over the past few decades",
    ", numerous simulations have been made of starburst - driven winds @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed two - dimensional , axisymmetric simulations of a galactic wind in an isothermal ism , with varying densities and temperatures .",
    "they concluded that the h@xmath0 filaments form from disk gas that has been entrained into the flow and that the x - ray emission most likely arises from shocked disk and halo gas .",
    "more recently , @xcite performed a series of simulations , focusing on the energetics and x - ray emission from the wind .",
    "as with @xcite , their simulations were two - dimensional and axisymmetric with an isothermal ism .",
    "they found that a large fraction of the soft x - ray emission in their model comes from shock - heated ambient gas and from the interfaces between cool dense and hot tenuous gas .",
    "while these simulations provide some insight into the origin of the x - ray and h@xmath0 emission , the homogeneous nature of these models and their symmetry renders them incapable of forming significant filamentary structures , limiting their ability to constrain the emission processes .    in order to improve upon previous models and to gain a better understanding of the origin of the h@xmath0 filaments and x - ray emission ,",
    "we have performed a series of three - dimensional simulations of a galactic wind in an inhomogeneously distributed interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the introduction of inhomogeneity is important as the interstellar medium in a galaxy disk is highly complex in all its phases ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "*  and references therein ) .",
    "inhomogeneity is also crucial in the development of a wind , as energy from massive stars formed in dense molecular clouds in the starburst region may be radiated away before a wind could form .",
    "a wind is more likely to develop from the kinetic energy from stellar winds adjacent to the diffuse gas surrounding the clouds .",
    "the inhomogeneous structure of the ism is also likely to affect the distribution of filaments throughout the wind , producing asymmetric and tilted outflows .",
    "it is likely that the size and strength of the starburst itself plays an important role in determining the morphology .",
    "many starburst galaxies , such as m82 and ngc 3079 , contain circumnuclear starbursts , with their resultant outflows being strong and violent @xcite .",
    "other starbursts are weaker and have less prominent outflows .",
    "an example is ngc 4631 , which is currently undergoing a disk - wide starburst @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the formation of the emission line filaments by modeling the formation of a wind from several super star clusters .",
    "they proposed that kiloparsec long filaments are formed from stationary and oblique shocks . in this paper",
    "we present a different model , which follows a similar approach to that of @xcite , but introduces an inhomogeneous disk .",
    "we follow the evolution of a starburst - driven wind in different ism conditions and discuss the effect of the inhomogeneity of the disk on the morphology of the wind .",
    "we consider the morphology of the h@xmath0 emitting filaments separately and investigate their origin .",
    "finally , the luminosity of the soft and hard x - ray emitting gas is calculated and we suggest an origin for the soft x - ray emission .",
    "the simulations were performed using a ppmlr code ( piecewise parabolic method with a lagrangian remap ) , which is based on the method described by @xcite . the code has been extensively modified ( see , for example ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from the original vh-1 code @xcite .",
    "it is a multi - dimensional hydrodynamics code , optimized for use on multiple processors of the sgi altix computer operated by the australian partnership for advanced computing ( apac ) .",
    "thermal cooling has been incorporated , based upon the output from the mappings iii code ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , enabling the realistic evolution of a radiatively cooling gas .",
    "the simulations discussed in this paper are three - dimensional and utilize cartesian ( x , y , z ) coordinates . in each cell of the computational grid ,",
    "the density , temperature , velocity , emissivity and a disk gas tracer are recorded at intervals of 0.01 myr .",
    "following @xcite , the gravitational potential used in these simulations consists of a stellar spheroid and a disk .",
    "let @xmath1 = @xmath2 be the radius of the stellar spheroid , @xmath3 the core radius , @xmath4 its mass , @xmath5 the mass of the disk , @xmath6 its radial scale length , and @xmath7 its vertical scale length .",
    "the potential @xmath8 of the stellar spheroid is described by an analytic king model ( eq . [ [ ss ] ] ) and the disk potential @xmath9 by a @xcite model ( eq . [ [ disk ] ] ) .",

    "note also that simulations including cooling admit a one - parameter scaling which is described in @xcite .",
    "within limits the simulations may be scaled to smaller or larger galaxies .",
    "we adopted parameters for the above potential by approximately fitting the rotation curve of m82 ( figure [ fig1 ] ) ; the parameters are summarized in table [ tab_param ] .",
    "this produces a good fit at the smaller radii used in these simulations .",
    "we neglect the contribution of a dark matter halo , since our model only extends to a radius of less than 1 kpc .",
    "this is justified because , for example , in the galaxy where the contribution of dark matter is well constrained at all radii , it is now well established that baryonic matter dominates the potential within the solar circle ( see * ? ? ?",

    "we adopt @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36\\ ] ]    we follow the same approach as @xcite and introduce an ensemble mean density distribution which introduces a turbulence parameter .",
    "the introduction of turbulence removes the need to impose artificially high temperatures to achieve reasonable disk scale heights .",
    "we discuss the details of this distribution below . in order to construct the warm inhomogeneous disk ,",
    "we first establish the ensemble mean density distribution .",

    "while smaller values of e@xmath42 would result in a thicker disk @xcite , we adopt @xmath40 = 0.95 in all models , in order to produce a gaseous disk with a finite radial extent .",

    "figure [ cont ] shows density contours of various homogeneous ism distributions , demonstrating the effect of varying the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the case of @xmath46 is equivalent to the density distribution used by , for example , @xcite . in this case",
    ", the average temperature of the disk must be high (  @xmath47 k ) in order to produce reasonable disk scale - heights ( bottom row ) . however , this scenario is unrealistic as gas at this temperature rapidly cools .",
    "the turbulence parameter @xmath44 allows us to increase the disk scale - height , whilst keeping the temperature at reasonable values .",
    "nevertheless , this parameter can not be made too large as the turbulence quickly becomes hypersonic , and gas in the disk would be highly dissipative . in these simulations",
    "we set the average temperature of the disk gas to be @xmath48 and we use the cloud velocity dispersions of @xmath49 ( panels a and b respectively ) .",
    "whilst these values are supersonic with mach numbers of the order of 5 - 6 , they were chosen in order to obtain a reasonable disk thickness without the gas being excessively supersonic and , as noted , to avoid excessively high temperatures .",
    "the supersonic turbulence may be driven by star formation ; it is also possible that the vertical pressure support is provided by magnetic fields .",
    "note however , that supersonic velocities in gaseous disks are not unknown .",
    "for example , the disks in m87 and ngc  7052 are inferred to be supersonic with velocity dispersions @xmath50 in m87 and up to @xmath51 in ngc  7052 @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the concept of supersonic turbulence is not new in the context of starburst galaxies and is a key feature of the simulations of the ism in such galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular these papers focus on the production of a log - normal ism such as has been incorporated into our initial data .",
    "further justification for a log - normal ism and its relation to supersonic / superalfvenic turbulence , appealing to the work of @xcite and @xcite is provided in @xcite .",
    "the funnel seen in earlier simulations which utilize a similar potential ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is still present in our model , most noticeably in panels c and f. this is more apparent if one examines the density distribution over a larger spatial range .",
    "this is an unavoidable consequence of this type of disk model and one would need to revisit models for the initial data in order to eliminate it in a physically acceptable fashion .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "a specific inhomogeneous ism ( out of an ensemble of such possible isms ) is obtained by multiplying equation ( [ warm ] ) by a fractal distribution , which has log - normal single point statistics and a kolmogorov density spectrum ( see * ? ? ?",
    "*  for further details ) .",
    "the fractal distribution has mean @xmath52 = 1.0 and variance @xmath53 = 5.0 , where the variance measures the concentration of mass within the dense clouds @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the disk clouds is determined by the pressure of the disk gas and the density of the clouds .",
    "the maximum temperature of the disk gas is set to be @xmath45 = 3.0 @xmath15 10@xmath54 k in order to prevent disk gas from having temperatures near the peak of the cooling function .",
    "gas at temperatures above this limit is replaced by hot halo gas .    in principle , the resulting warm gas distribution is supported in the gravitational potential by a combination of thermal pressure and turbulence .",
    "however , we did not impose a turbulent velocity field because the interaction with the wind generated by the starburst dominates in the vertical direction .",
    "however , we did find that a value of @xmath55 led to some radial inflow so that we compensated for this by adopting @xmath56 ( i.e azimuthal velocity equal to keplerian velocity ) for the velocity field only .",
    "the rotation of the disk causes some additional ( but unimportant ) problems , as the boundary conditions used in the code are unable to handle inhomogeneous gas rotating onto the computational grid .",
    "this results in numerical artifacts at the boundaries , with streams of uniform dense gas appearing on the grid as the disk rotates .",
    "these artifacts only appear at the external @xmath57 and @xmath58 boundaries and do not effect the evolution of the winds produced in the simulations . nor",
    "do they affect the production of the filaments .",
    "we constrain the central density and temperature of the ism in the disk and halo to be in pressure equilibrium , with @xmath59 = 10@xmath60  @xmath22 k , consistent with the central regions of starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the hot halo and warm disk are summarized in table [ tab_param ] .",
    "the starburst region of m82 is believed to be a flattened disk ( see * ? ? ? *  and references therein ) .",

    "we inject mass and energy into this region proportional to the initial density @xmath61 ( eq . [ [ mass_inj ] ] and [ [ energy_inj ] ] ) so that regions of the ism that are likely to contain stars have a higher injection rate of mass and energy .",

    "a comparison of the morphology of the outflow at 1 myr and 2 myr epochs in the models m01 , m02 , and m03 is shown in figure [ f5 ] .",
    "the wind begins as a series of small bubbles originating from the clumpy gas in the starburst region .",
    "these bubbles merge as they expand , forming a larger bubble that breaks out of the disk at approximately 0.15 myr .",
    "the introduction of the inhomogeneous disk leads to a marked dependence of the morphology of the wind on the distribution of the ism , with the initial shape of the outflow determined by the path the wind follows as it interacts with the dense clouds .",
    "this results in the asymmetrical morphology seen in all simulations . the thicker disk in m02 acts to slow the development of the outflow , with the wind breaking out of the disk at approximately 0.2 myr , somewhat later than the winds in m01 and m03 .",
    "it should be noted that the wind does not `` blow - out '' of the disk as observed in numerous homogeneous simulations ( see for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "*  and references within ) .",
    "this is the result of the inhomogeneous nature of the ism in the disk of our model . unlike a wind formed in an homogeneous disk , which is forced to push its way out of the dense disk ,",
    "a wind formed in an inhomogeneous medium follows the path of least resistance , i.e. the tenuous gas between clouds of disk gas .",
    "the density of these clouds prevents them from being immediately swept - up by the outflowing hot gas . as a result , the wind does not sweep - up and form a dense shell of disk gas , as is found in the homogeneous case .",
    "the formation of such a dense shell has been shown to impede the expansion of the wind until it has reached a sufficient distance from the disk , where the shell begins to fragment under rayleigh - taylor instabilities allowing the wind to `` blow - out '' of the shell . in the inhomogeneous case",
    "the wind expands freely into the more tenuous halo gas , which is swept - up to form its own `` shell '' around the outflow .",
    "this shell of swept - up halo gas is also observed in the homogeneous case after their wind has blown - out of the disk and is expanding into the halo .",
    "it is unlikely that the presence of a thicker disk in our model would result in the formation of a dense shell of disk gas surrounding the outflow , as any wind formed in such a clumpy medium naturally follows the path of least resistance out of the disk .    by 0.5 myr ( figure [ f4 ] ; upper left panel ) , the wind has become more spherical as it propagates into the uniform hot halo . at this stage the structure of the bubble consists of fast ( @xmath72 @xmath73 1000 km s@xmath29 ) , hot ( @xmath74 ) , turbulent gas , surrounded by a slower ( @xmath75 ) , cooler ( @xmath76 ) , dense shell of swept - up halo gas . aside from the slower development of the wind in m02 and a slight difference in overall shape ,",
    "the morphology at this time is similar in all models .    at 1.0 myr ,",
    "the wind has begun to flow off the edge of the computational grid . at this stage , in all simulations ( figure [ f5 ] , upper panels ) the outflow resembles the basic structure of a superbubble in the `` snow - plow '' phase of its evolution @xcite , wherein the bubble is sweeping a substantial amount of the ambient hot ism .",
    "this phase is characterized by 5 zones , which are illustrated in figure [ f6 ] :    * the central injection zone ( t @xmath77 5 @xmath15 10@xmath78 ) .",
    "* a supersonic free - wind ( @xmath79 10@xmath80 , @xmath81 ) * a region of hot , shocked , turbulent gas ( t @xmath73 10@xmath78 k , @xmath72 @xmath82 500 - 1200 km s@xmath29 ) .",
    "* a cooler , dense outer shell ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) . * the undisturbed ambient gas ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the second and third zones are separated by a wind shock . at this time , the cool , dense disk gas has begun to be accelerated into the wind and is distributed throughout the free - wind region .",
    "the amount and distribution of this gas varies between models .",
    "again , the structure of the outflow is heavily influenced by the initial distribution of clouds in the disk . as a result of the thicker disk ,",
    "the outflow in m02 is still somewhat less extended than the outflow in m01 , but displays similar structures , such as the `` cavity '' to the upper right of the starburst region . in m03 ,",
    "the altered cloud distribution in the disk results in a somewhat different morphology to that of m01 , with the outer swept - up shell and wind shock being wider and more flat .    at later times ,",
    "most of the outer shell has flowed off the computational grid and the shape of the wind shock has taken on a more hour - glass - like appearance .",
    "the wind shock appears more asymmetric in the case of m03 , while m02 displays similar , but less evolved structure to m01 .",
    "for example , the arc of dense disk gas to the lower right is evident in both outflows . in all models",
    ", disk gas continues to be accelerated into the free - wind . by 2.0 myr ( lower panels ) , the computational grid is mainly occupied by the free - wind region . at this stage , disk gas that has been swept into the flow forms filamentary - like structures , consisting of strings of clouds with velocities in the range of @xmath86 ( figure [ f9 ] ) .    in view of the above descriptions at various epochs",
    ", it is apparent that inhomogeneities in the disk result in asymmetries on relatively small ( @xmath87 ) scales .",
    "however , in all models the wind becomes more uniform as it propagates into the homogeneous halo .",
    "it is therefore likely that asymmetries on the large scale ( e.g. tilted outflows ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are caused by inhomogeneities in the halo gas , such as the neutral hydrogen cloud enveloping m82 @xcite .",
    "a difficulty with previous two - dimensional simulations of starburst winds is their inability to confine the base of the outflow , which expands over the course of the simulations , resulting in unrealistic base diameters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the simulations of @xcite resulted in base diameters of the order of 1000 pc , whereas the base of m82 s outflow has been observed to be @xmath82 400 pc @xcite .",
    "while the base diameter of @xmath82 600 - 800 pc for m82 observed by @xcite compares more favorably to those found in previous simulations of these winds , it is clear that some mechanism must be in place to prevent the base of the outflow from expanding radially as the wind evolves .",
    "@xcite were able to confine the base of the outflow in their simulations by including the inflow of disk gas onto the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "this resulted in the downward ram pressure of the infalling gas to be greater than the thermal pressure in the central region , preventing the outflow from expanding .",
    "however , as noted by @xcite , the amount of gas required in this scenario is unrealistic . in our simulations the base of the outflow",
    "is well confined , not expanding beyond a radius of @xmath82 200 pc over the 2 myr time frame ( see figure [ f4 ] ) .",
    "while it is possible that the size of the base may increase if the simulations were followed to later times , the density of the disk gas ( @xmath82 100 @xmath22 ) is large enough to impede the expansion of the outflow along the major axis of the disk .      in discussing the degree of collimation of the winds , we refer to the opening angle of the cone defined by the h@xmath0 filaments , @xmath88 and the opening angle of the cone defined by the hot wind , @xmath89 .",

    "however , m03 which initially contains more gas inside its starburst region than m01 ( see table [ tab_sims ] ) , has a smaller amount of filamentary gas in the wind , as a result of the more sparse distribution of clouds surrounding the starburst region .",
    "there have been many theories for the origin of the optical line filaments observed in starburst winds .",

    "however , while the filaments do form a biconical outflow ( figure [ f8 ] ) , they are immersed inside the hot wind and do not trace the true _ radial _ and _ vertical _ extent of the outflow as defined by the hot gas ( figures [ f4 ] and [ f7 ] ) .",
    "this paints a different picture to the commonly held view of the optical line - emission filaments framing the edges of a biconical outflow .",

    "@xcite also possibly detect diffuse , low - surface brightness , x - ray emission in in m82 s halo , which has a larger spatial extent and uniformity than the filamentary x - ray emission . on the other hand , they note that this may be caused by low photon statistics .",
    "it is clear that multi - wavelength observations are needed in order to understand the true extent of starburst winds .",
    "the tendency of the filaments to fill the interior of the biconical structure arising from our simulations is also of interest .",

    "other winds , such as m82 @xcite and ngc 3079 @xcite , are limb - brightened , with the filaments thought to lie on the surface of a mostly hollow structure .",
    "the mechanism responsible for producing an evacuated cavity is uncertain , but in view of the way in which filaments have been formed in our simulations , this feature may reflect the distribution of the interstellar medium in the starburst region itself .",
    "starbursts where much of the molecular gas is situated in a ring ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , rather than throughout a disk , would most likely produce winds that are hollow , as the clouds in the ring are broken up and entrained into the wind .",
    "another possibility is that the wind has significantly evolved to point where it has evacuated the center of the starburst region of molecular gas , with the filamentary system being fed from gas stripped from the edge of the starburst region , an effect that in fact does occur in our simulations ( e.g. figure [ f7 ] ; lower left panel ) .",

    "figure [ fig12 ] shows the volume emissivity of the soft x - rays at 1 myr ( left ) and 2 myr ( right ) epochs . as with the hard x - ray emission in figure [ fig11 ] ,",
    "there is little difference between the models m01 , m02 , and m03 , with x - rays arising from the same processes in each model .",
    "at 1 myr it can be clearly seen that the swept - up shell is a strong emitter of soft x - rays .",
    "this shell consists of halo gas that has been swept into the wind and shock heated to @xmath123 .",
    "this source of soft x - ray emission is straightforward and is not subject to the qualifications described above .    at 2 myr ,",

    "soft x - rays arise when a bow shock ( t @xmath82 10@xmath78 k ) forms upstream of clouds of disk gas ( t @xmath82 10@xmath25 k ) that have been accelerated into the flow by the ram pressure of the hot wind ( t @xmath82 10@xmath24 k ) .",

    "however , it is possible to extrapolate from the structure of the wind at 1 myr and 2 myr to get an idea of the soft x - ray emission arising from the wind at later times .",
    "figure [ fig14 ] shows a schematic of the x - ray and h@xmath0 emitting gas in a starburst wind , based on the results of our simulations . in   [ filaments ]",
    "we proposed the formation of the h@xmath0 emitting filaments from the breakup of disk clouds in the starburst region that are then accelerated into the wind by ram pressure .",
    "these clouds are potentially the source of the mass - loaded gas discussed above , with tails of soft x - ray gas streaming from their surfaces ( subject to the caveats already noted concerning numerical diffusion ) .",
    "the presence of clouds of disk gas in the outflow also results in the formation of bow shocks as they are accelerated by the wind .",
    "x - rays that arise from these processes are naturally spatially correlated to the h@xmath0 emission in the wind . while the x - ray emission in our simulations is volume filled , which was also found to be the case with the h@xmath0 emission ( see figure [ f8 ] ) , many starburst winds are found to be limb - brightened in x - rays",
    ". however , there is evidence to suggest that some winds may at least be partially volume filled ( e.g. ngc 3079 : * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , the observed physical connection between the two wavelengths suggests that the same mechanism responsible for the production of limb - brightened outflows in h@xmath0 , result in limb - brightened x - ray emission .",
    "we now return to discuss further features of the soft x - ray luminosity ( figure [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "while the soft x - ray luminosity is similar in all of our models , slight differences reflect the morphology of each wind .",
    "the models m01 and m03 , whose initial isms differed only by the distribution of clouds in the disk , have almost identical soft x - ray luminosities . on the other hand , the wind formed in the model m02 , initially has a lower luminosity than the other models .",
    "this is a consequence of the thinner shell that forms around the outflow . at 2 myr ,",
    "when the contribution of this shell is no longer taken into account , the luminosity of the wind m02 is comparable to that of the other models .",
    "the highest soft x - ray luminosities reached in our models occur when the swept - up shell still lies on the computational grid . at this time , the luminosity of the wind is of the order of l@xmath122 @xmath82 10@xmath126 erg s@xmath29 . when the shell is not included , and soft x - ray emission arises solely from the processes associated with the h@xmath0 emission discussed above , the luminosity is of the order l@xmath122 @xmath82 10@xmath121 erg s@xmath29 .",

    "our values fall at the lower end of this range , but clearly the x - ray luminosity is dependent on the volume of the wind and would be higher at later times .",
    "in order to test the effect of the numerical resolution on our model , a fourth simulation ( m04 ) was performed on a smaller computational grid of 256 @xmath15 256 @xmath15 256 cells , but otherwise identical to m01 .",
    "the effect of the resolution is most significant with respect to the h@xmath0 emitting gas found in the outflow .",
    "figure [ fig15 ] gives the logarithm of the temperature at 2 myr in m04 ( left ) and m01 ( right ) .",
    "m04 differs only by its smaller computational grid . whilst it exhibits a similar overall shape and structure ( i.e. biconical structure ) , smaller structures , such as bow shocks ,",
    "are not well resolved .",
    "the dense gas that makes up the h@xmath0 filaments has not been adequately resolved , appearing as strands of gas , rather than as the strings of clouds found in the higher resolution simulations .",
    "we find that the lower resolution of m04 results in soft x - ray luminosities that are comparable to those in m01 ( figure [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the luminosity in both soft and hard energy bands follows a similar trend to that of the three main models , with the luminosity being slightly higher in the soft band and lower in the hard . as with in the other models , the hard x - ray emission originates from the starburst region . on the other hand ,",
    "as bow shocks are not well resolved at the lower resolution in m04 , the majority of the soft x - ray emission arises from the swept - up shell of halo gas , and from the mass - loaded component of the wind .",
    "as previously noted , numerical diffusion causes difficulties in accurately determining the soft x - ray luminosity of the wind in regions of mixing gas .",
    "as some of the x - ray emission is poorly resolved ( i.e. only a few cells in size ) it is likely that the calculated luminosities may be poorly estimated in these regions .",
    "this is particularly likely at the interfaces between the hot wind and the cool entrained gas , which emits strongly in soft x - rays .",
    "this region is at best a few cells in width and any x - ray emission is likely a result of mass diffusion between the hot and cold gas and not physical .",
    "numerical diffusion may also be an issue in the mass - loaded component of the wind , which appears to be the largest contributor to the soft x - ray emission .",
    "mixing of the cool gas stripped of clouds accelerated into the wind with the surrounding hot gas may have resulted in temperatures and densities that emit strongly at x - ray energies .",
    "however , we note that this effect may be physical in origin .",
    "the fact that the soft x - ray luminosity in both m01 and m04 are similar at 2 myr , when the majority of the emission is from the mass - loaded component , is encouraging , but higher resolution simulations are needed in order to determine if the luminosities achieved in our simulations are realistic .",
    "we have performed a series of three - dimensional simulations of a starburst - driven galactic wind designed to test the evolution of the wind in different ism conditions . by conducting three - dimensional simulations we are able , for the first time , to study the morphology and dynamics of the entire outflow .",
    "the introduction of an inhomogeneous disk enables us to study the development of asymmetries and the interaction of the wind with clouds in the disk .",
    "the results of these simulations are as follows-    1 .",
    "the interstellar medium plays a pivotal role in the evolution of a galactic wind .",
    "the interaction of the wind with clouds in the disk results in asymmetries and tilted outflows on the small scale .",
    "nevertheless , it is likely that inhomogeneities in the halo are the cause of the large - scale asymmetries in an outflow .",
    "2 .   the distribution of gas surrounding the starburst region assists in collimating the outflow .",
    "the thickness of the disk and the location of the starburst are important factors in determining the degree of collimation , with the degree of collimation increasing with the amount of gas surrounding the starburst region .",
    "the base of the outflow is well confined within a radius of 200 pc over the 2 myr time frame of the simulation as a result of the high density of the disk gas .",
    "the h@xmath0 filaments form from the breakup of clouds in the starburst region , the fragments of which are then accelerated by the ram pressure of the wind .",
    "filaments are also formed from gas that has been stripped from the sides of the starburst region .",
    "the distribution and mass of the filaments is affected by the distribution of clouds in the vicinity of the starburst region .",
    "the h@xmath0 filaments appear as strings of disk gas that form a filled biconical structure inside of a more spherical hot wind .",
    "the filaments are distributed throughout this structure , but do not trace the true extent to the wind defined by the hot gas .",
    "the calculated soft x - ray luminosities up until 2.0 myr are of the order of 10@xmath121 - 10@xmath126 erg s@xmath29 and the hard x - ray luminosities of 10@xmath121 erg s@xmath29 .",
    "these luminosities are dependent on the volume of the wind and would be larger for a more evolved outflow . 7 .",
    "interior to the swept - up shell of halo gas , soft x - ray emission originates in the same region as the h@xmath0 emitting gas .",
    "while higher resolution simulations are needed to confirm x - ray emission from mixing processes , we find 4 mechanisms that give rise to soft x - rays : ( i ) the mass - loaded wind , ( ii ) the intermediate temperature interface between the hot wind and cool filaments , ( iii ) bow shocks , and ( iv ) interactions between bow shocks .",
    "the shell is also a major contributor to the soft x - ray emission , but has no associated h@xmath0 emission .",
    "the hard x - ray emission originates from gas in the starburst region .",
    "the results of these simulations indicate that the host galaxy itself and the environment in which it is situated is a major determinant in the morphology of the outflow .",
    "the emission processes that contribute to the h@xmath0 and soft x - ray emission may vary from one galaxy to the next . whether the h@xmath0 emission originates from photoionization or from shock - heating ( or both ) can not be determined from these simulations .",
    "however , we do find an abundance of filamentary t @xmath82 10@xmath54 k gas that has been accelerated into the outflow , forming a biconical shaped region that is commonly observed in starburst winds .",
    "the source of the soft x - ray emission is also likely to depend upon the environment of the host galaxy . in the case of m82",
    "it is plausible that the interaction of the wind with the surrounding hi clouds is also a contributor to the soft x - ray emission , in addition to the processes mentioned above .",
    "the observed spatial relationship between the h@xmath0 and soft x - ray emitting gas can be explained when considering emission processes interior to the wind , such as bow - shocks and the mass - loaded component of the wind . in addition , the presence of the strong x - ray emitting shell with no associated h@xmath0 emission is interesting .",
    "while the ultimate fate of the shell is unknown at present , this result argues for the presence of x - ray emission more extended than the filamentary h@xmath0 gas .",
    "@xcite suggest that this emission may be detectable in more distant starburst galaxies .",
    "in future work we shall investigate the evolution of a wind over a larger time frame and spatial extent than our current study , and look at the total energy budget of the outflow .",
    "it is also important to further test the effect of resolution on the filaments , and in particular the associated soft x - ray emission that arises through mixing of the hot wind and the cooler disk gas , and will be the subject of a subsequent paper ."
