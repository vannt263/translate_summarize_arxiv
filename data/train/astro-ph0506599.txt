    "emission from hii regions is one of the most direct optical tracers of current star formation activity and is routinely used to measure star formation rates in external galaxies ( e.g. kennicutt 1992 ) . in our own galaxy ,",
    "hii regions are seen by direct uv illumination of molecular clouds from adjacent hot stars and as highly structured shells , bubbles and sheets of emission resulting from supernovae , planetary nebula , wolf - rayet stars and other stellar outflows .",
    "some large - scale outflows can , in turn , be themselves a trigger of star formation , and their morphology is strongly influenced by the nature and density of the ism into which they expand .",
    "imaging allows this to be studied in great detail in our immediate galactic neighbourhood and to be detected at a great distance in external galaxies .",
    "the uv flux from hot stars also excites a more diffuse emission from the ism , unconnected to current star formation and detectable over large areas of sky .",
    "the perimeters of some large emission shells appear to enclose the locations of more recent star formation which may in turn generate further supernovae and stellar winds ( dopita , matthewson & ford 1985 ) , while their morphology informs the processes by which star formation is propagated ( e.g. elmegreen & lada 1977 , gerola & seiden 1978 ) . because of proximity , some of these structures can present very large angular sizes such as barnard s loop ( probably the first large - scale emission structure detected in the galaxy ) which subtends 13  ( pickering 1890 ) and",
    "the gum nebula which at 36 , is even larger ( gum 1952 ) .",
    "more distant complexes or groups of hii regions , such as ngc 6334 , can still be of the order 1  across and yet present fine detail on arcsecond scales ( meaburn & white 1982 ) . given their interaction with their external large - scale environment ( tenorio - tagle & palous 1987 ) it was clear that emission - line imaging of these structures required an efficient wide - field capability and high spatial resolution .",
    "on smaller scales , stellar  emission characterises the short lived , least well understood stages of stellar evolution , i.e. those of pre- and post - main sequence stars , planetary nebulae and close binary systems .",
    "previous efforts to detect emission sources have either offered modest area coverage ; e.g. the ubvi and  photometric surveys of sung , chun & bessell ( 2000 ) or keller et al .",
    "( 2001 ) or , where a large - area survey has been conducted , becomes incomplete at relatively bright magnitudes .",
    "an example is the objective - prism survey of stephenson & sanduleak ( 1977 ) which reaches only @xmath014@xmath3 magnitude .",
    "such surveys are highly incomplete so their emission source catalogues provide only limited samples upon which to build our understanding of these rarely observed phases of stellar evolution .    from the above",
    ", the importance of galactic  line emission from both stars and nebulae is evident and this has encouraged many surveys for hii regions in particular , e.g. sharpless ( 1953 , 1959 ) , gum ( 1955 ) , hase & shajn ( 1955 ) , bok , bester & wade ( 1955 ) , johnson ( 1955 , 1956 ) , rodgers , campbell & whiteoak ( 1960 ) , georgelin & georgelin ( 1970 ) and sivan ( 1974 ) .",
    "these earlier surveys were limited to relatively small targeted areas or had such wide fields of view that small - scale detail was lost due to the low angular resolution ; e.g. the survey of sivan ( 1974 ) used 60  field diameters giving a plate scale of @xmath4  mm@xmath5 .",
    "relatively little optical emission - line survey work had been done in a way that combined wide - angle coverage with good sensitivity and high resolution .",
    "these characteristics are essential to allow thorough examination of the morphology and interaction of emission regions with their environment on arcsecond to degree scales and to detect the large variety of stellar emission sources to suitably faint levels .",
    "hence , in the mid-1990s , a number of the present authors suggested that the u.k .",
    "schmidt telescope ( ukst ) should be used to make a narrow band photographic  survey of the southern milky way and magellanic clouds .",
    "the only previous wide - area ukst   material comes from the work by meaburn and co - workers in the 1970s ( see davies , elliot & meaburn 1976 ; meaburn 1980 ) . they used a 100   band - pass multi - element mosaic filter and fast , but coarse grained , 098 - 04 emulsion .",
    "it covered some limited areas close to the galactic plane ( meaburn & white 1982 ) , but was mainly influential in the study of the ionised gas in the magellanic clouds , showing the first evidence for `` supergiant - shells '' and other large - scale features ( davies et al .",
    "1976 , meaburn 1980 ) .",
    "there are other recent wide - area  surveys such as that by the virginia group in the northern hemisphere ( vtss  dennison et al .",
    "1998 ) and the mount stromlo group in the south ( buxton et al . 1998 ) .",
    "recently , gaustad et al . (",
    "2001 ) have released the full `` southern  sky survey atlas '' ( shassa ) , covering the entire southern sky .",
    "this imaging survey has rather coarse , 48-arcsecond pixels and strong artefacts from uncancelled stars in the continuum - subtracted product , but has the major benefit of being directly calibrated in rayleighs .",
    "these surveys continue the tradition of deep , low spatial resolution studies , but use ccds which permit low flux densities of a few tenths of a rayleigh to be achieved .    an alternative approach , taken by the marseille and wisconsin fabry - perot groups in the southern and northern skies respectively ( see russeil et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 and haffner et al .",
    "2003 for the wham ",
    "wisconsin  mapper ) , was to obtain high resolution spectral ( i.e. velocity ) data , but again with low spatial resolution ( e.g. 1  pixels for wham ) .    a critical comparison between the wham , shassa and vtss surveys was undertaken by finkbeiner ( 2003 ) who presented a ` whole - sky '  map .",
    "significantly , none of these major surveys offer the arcsecond spatial resolution of the aao / ukst  survey .",
    "a summary of fundamental properties of these modern surveys is given in table  [ surveys ] .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the full resolution , @xmath6 m pixel data and associated iam parameterised data for both the  and sr scanned exposures are stored on - line on a field by field basis . on the  web - site the scanned survey data for each field has the prefix ` hal ' before the survey field number ( so h@xmath7 survey field h350 = hal0350 for example , when referring to the on - line digital  data ) .",
    "the sr images have been transformed to exactly match the pixel grid of the master exposures which permits direct image blinking and comparison between the pixel data for each field .",
    "the general  survey data products are accessed via a web interface that has the same look and feel as the existing broad - band supercosmos on - line ` sss ' surveys but with some additional functionality .",
    "the iam data produced for each field can be downloaded separately if desired or assembled into seamless catalogues on - the - fly which can cover several adjacent fields using the ` get a catalogue ' option .",
    "the combined iam data is organised into a full listing of 53 image parameters or a more manageable subset of the most useful 32 as in table  [ iamparams ] .",
    "a set of ` expert ' options are also available to further select catalogue extraction parameters . a special feature to create a difference image of each field following variable image psf matching techniques developed by bond et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also exists to permit large - scale resolved emission maps to be created with reduced artefacts from uncancelled stars",
    ". this can be computationally intensive and so is not generally available without prior arrangement with the wide - field astronomy unit .",
    "for most applications simple quotient imaging between the  and sr pixel data is sufficient due to the well matched psf s and depth .",
    "a @xmath8 blocked - down version of each field is also available as both a gif image and as a fits file which has the wcs built in to the fits header .",
    "these whole field maps can be studied to select smaller regions of interest for extraction at full resolution using the ` get an image ' option .",
    "the full resolution pixel data access limit is currently set at @xmath9  arcmin@xmath10 with regions downloaded as fits files ( also with wcs ) and both the sr and  data for the same region can be downloaded simultaneously .",
    "areas for extraction can be chosen via equatorial ( j2000 or b1950 ) or galactic _",
    "( l , b ) _ co - ordinates in a variable @xmath11 arcminute rectangular region format .",
    "a clickable map of the current fields on - line enables individual field details to be displayed prior to viewing the blocked full field image .",
    "a batch mode enables large numbers of thumb - nail images to be extracted around objects of interest with the option to return  and/or sr postscript plots of the extracted images .",
    "an option to apply a ` flat - field ' to the  pixel data in intensity space is included to permit correction of the non - uniformities in the measured exposures arising from the excellent but slightly varying  filter transmission profile .",
    "this has been shown to work effectively and is described in section  9 .",
    "a radius of 153  mm ( @xmath12 degrees ) from each survey field centre has been adopted as the region with good data ( @xmath13 per cent correction factors ) .",
    "the ` good data ' radius from each scanned field centre has been used in creating a confidence map which is incorporated into the extracted fits image as an additional fits extension ( extension [ 3 ] , e.g test-image.fits[3 ] ) .",
    "this can be used to flag areas of the extracted image that might not be quite as good as others .",
    "currently this has values of 100 for regions extracted interior to this radius and 0 for regions outside .",
    "the iam catalogue downloaded directly via the ` get a catalogue ' option or as incorporated in the fits table extension to the dowloaded pixel data via the ` get an image ' option , contains information not just from the  and the sr images but also from the serc - i ( near infrared ) survey which has been carefully matched in with the shs data .",
    "the i - band data is particularly useful when searching for point - source   emitters as it can help to eliminate contamination from late - type stars .",
    "however there are issues that any user should be aware of when combining the i - band data with the shs magnitudes .",
    "when calibrating ukst data , positional and magnitude - dependent systematic errors are present as a result of variations in emulsion sensitivity and vignetting towards the image corners ( hambly et al .",
    "the i - band survey was taken on standard eso / serc 5  field centres , so the vignetting will have a different effect on the two sets of photometry at a given survey location .",
    "furthermore , the i - band data are calibrated to relatively few standards .",
    "these differences are evident when looking at a plot of sr magnitude versus @xmath15 colour derived from the sr and paired i - band photometry .",
    "figure  [ colcorr ] shows two colour magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) for stars taken from a 10  arcminute region centred on the middle of shs field h1109 in monoceros where the low galactic reddening of @xmath16=0.24 ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) should leave the @xmath15 colour roughly constant for much of the observed magnitude range .",
    "figure  [ colcorr]a shows the raw result , where a large , unphysical variation of 3.5 magnitudes is seen in the @xmath15 colour from the brightest to the faintest objects .",
    "this is removed as a first - order correction from the survey data by selecting a master colour , in this case the sr , and correcting the i - band across all survey fields .",
    "note however that at fainter limits one in fact expects redder @xmath15 colours as such stars are likely to be further away and prone to be more dust reddened or intrinsically fainter and therefore more likely to be late types .",
    "hence some modest slope is expected .",
    "figure  [ colcorr]b shows the cmd for the same patch of sky after the colour correction has been applied , giving a result in better agreement with expectation .",
    "the data can be downloaded in corrected or uncorrected form via an option in the `` expert '' parameters of the shs website .",
    "it is important to ensure that the i - band correction is not applied inappropriately , i.e. in a field of intrinsically high reddening , as such a correction will remove genuine features from the data .",
    "it should be used with caution .",
    "= 5.0 cm = 5.0 cm",
    "a significant advantage of the shs data over its rivals is the ability to detect point sources which have been photometrically calibrated to ccd standards ( e.g. boyle et al .",
    "1995 , croom et al 1999 ) . with measurements of isophotal magnitude and object classifications , it is possible to apply a photometric calibration to the  and sr films by comparing the supercosmos raw magnitudes of stars from the tycho-2 catalogue ( hog et al .",
    "2000 ) and the guide star photometric catalogue ( lasker et al . 1988 ) .",
    "these in turn are checked against photometric standards derived from the ccd observations given by croom et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and boyle et al .",
    "the narrow - band  images are calibrated to an ` r - equivalent ' scale .",
    "the 3 hour  and 15 minute sr exposures are matched so that both reach similar depths of m@xmath17@xmath1820.5 for point sources . where an object is detected in one band but not in the other a default value of 99.999",
    "is given in the catalogue data for the magnitude in the missing bandpass .",
    "positional and magnitude dependent errors are seen in the raw photometric data , created by varying transmission profile and diffraction effects through the thick ( 5.5 mm )  filter , but these are corrected for in the data available through the shs website by comparison with the sr data .",
    "photometric consistency is achieved by using the overlap regions between fields to match zero - points across the survey .",
    "these corrected magnitudes provide a means of selecting point - source emitters .",
    "the variations in measured iam stellar parameters as a function of field position arising from the variable psf from field rotation , vignetting etc , especially at large radii from the field centres , requires that such selection is performed over limited 1-degree areas . in this way",
    "stars with an emission line at  will show an enhanced  magnitude compared with the sr magnitude . at the bright end of the magnitude distribution ,",
    "severe photographic and   saturation effects come in to play , limiting stellar photometry to r of about 11 - 12 in both the  and sr pass - bands .",
    "spurious images appear from time to time in all photographic images scanned by supercosmos .",
    "they have a variety of forms and causes and are present in images extracted from the sss as well as shs .",
    "they can sometimes be picked up by examination of the pixel images directly , though they are often missed , and can also appear as spurious detections in the iam data .",
    "they have a variety of sizes and shapes and may be in or out of focus depending on whether the contaminating source is on the emulsion surface or on the platten used by supercosmos to sandwich the film flat for scanning . here , we differentiate between spurious images in the emulsion itself caused by processing defects , emulsion flaws and static marks , and those caused by foreign objects on the surface of the emulsion or on the back of the film . holes and scratches in the emulsion surface can also give rise to spurious images .",
    "satellite trails and transient phenomenon also give rise to real developed images which may have no counterpart in other survey bands of the same region .",
    "we do not consider these here .",
    "the supercosmos facility is situated in a class-100 clean room and each film is pressure air - cleaned prior to scanning . however , despite best efforts , particles that may already have been present on the emulsion before shipment to manifest themselves as spurious images .",
    "the biggest cause is fine particulate dust ( 20100@xmath19 m ) .",
    "unfortunately the estar film base of the tech - pan emulsion is prone to static charge build - up .",
    "the supercosmos scanning system is highly specular so detritus present on the emulsion surface that is often invisible when viewed under diffuse illumination conditions ( such as on a light table ) is revealed in sharp relief in the supercosmos data .",
    "the number of artefacts seen in the shs data is somewhat worse than on other glass plate based surveys of the sss .",
    "fortunately , having matched exposures in two bands makes identification of such artefacts more straightforward .",
    "for example , since the  and sr exposures are registered on the same pixel grid , quotient imaging can reveal the locations of spurious images .",
    "a @xmath20 arcminute region extracted from h273 , a field with a particularly high number of spurious images , is shown in figure  [ crud ] .",
    "we can take advantage of the fact that the pixel image properties of spurious images are usually quite distinct from real astronomical images , often having a sharpness below that possible from the combination of telescope optics and seeing disk .",
    "their shapes are often highly irregular and non - symmetrical such that they would not fit any normal psf .",
    "this makes them amenable to fourier filtering .",
    "objects that have no counterpart in the other band are potential spurious image candidates though variable objects , novae and the effects of de - blending complicate the issue significantly .",
    "various iam parameters such as the profile statistic , ellipticity etc . may also aid in identification .",
    "furthemore , spurious iam objects arising from de - blending overlaying contaminating fibres or hairs usually have very high ellipticities which may help in isolating likely candidates .",
    "storkey et al .",
    "( 2004 ) discuss techniques for recognising and eliminating spurious objects in the on - line supercosmos surveys . as",
    "yet this procedure has not been applied to the shs data .",
    "for any interference filter of the size used here , low - level non - uniformities exist which lead to residual non - physical background variations in the exposed images . in order to establish the magnitude of such effects , three flat - field exposures were taken with the filter subject to uniform illumination .",
    "the flat - field images permitted evaluation of the combined effects of filter transmission in the fast , @xmath21 schmidt beam and telescope vignetting ( see ukst unit handbook , tritton , 1983 ) .",
    "the flat - field images were exposed to place them on the linear portion of the film s characteristic curve and were averaged to give the filter / telescope transmission profile shown in figure  [ flatfield]a - b .    figure  [ flatfield]a shows transmission contours at 85 , 90 , 92 , 95 , 97 and 98 per cent of maximum transmission in the central region .",
    "the response is seen to be asymmetric , with the 97 per cent contour extending beyond the edge of the 5.16  field on the right , which corresponds to the west of the survey fields . in the east",
    "the transmission decreases more rapidly , reaching 85 per cent at the eastern edge . towards the filter corners the transmission drops",
    "further . however , the 4  overlapping centres ( section 4 ) and the asymmetric nature of the response allows the selection of  data requiring flat - field correction of less than 15 per cent for any given area of sky , provided that adjacent fields are available .",
    "most data will require much smaller flat - field corrections .",
    "the effect of flat - field corrections as large as 15 per cent on pixel data is considered in the survey calibration section .",
    "figure  [ flatfield]b is a histogram equalization of the actual flat - field pixel map which reveals the extremely low level artefacts present at the 0.1 per cent level which are invisible in a linear rendition .",
    "the flat - field correction has been stored as a transmission array with maximum value unity , so it is applied by dividing survey image values in intensity space by the relevant correction array elements .",
    "this is available as the default option on the shs website .",
    "the correction breaks down towards the corners of the scanned image and in regions outside of the clear aperture because the density of the exposures at the edges of the circular aperture is too low to lie on the straight line portion of the characteristic curve leading to an over - correction and also because the  filter transmission is becoming increasingly skewed in these extreme regions .",
    "raw transmission or photographic density values and generically calibrated intensity values without flat - field correction can also be requested on the download form .",
    "the iam data is obtained from the raw  scans without flat - field correction .",
    "= 6.5 cm = 5.5 cm      despite the superb quality of the filter , low - level , large - scale variations in transmitted flux can be seen in the  survey images under certain exposure conditions .",
    "in particular there are two parallel bands of slightly enhanced transmission ( leading to elevated photographic density ) going e - w in the north and south of the filter .",
    "these bands are only 13 per cent higher in intensity than the surrounding regions .",
    "a series of low - level artefacts which are not obvious in the contour plot because they are at a level of @xmath22 1 per cent can just be discerned in the filter transmission image in figure  [ flatfield]a - b .",
    "they can also just be seen in the contour plot as the spike in the 98 per cent contour just right of centre .",
    "the observed shape of these artefacts mimics the series of shallow concentric grooves scored into the surface of the mandrel to enable the tech - pan film to be sucked under light vacuum to the curved focal surface of the plate - holder to ensure proper focus .",
    "they are thought to arise from the backscattering off these grooves of light that has passed right through the film .",
    "again , it is gratifying that these artefacts , present at the @xmath23 per cent level , are effectively removed by application of the flat - field .",
    "= 7.0 cm = 7.0 cm      field h410 , which sits away from the galactic plane on the extreme edge of the survey at ( @xmath24 ) 330.2 , + 10.28 has been chosen to test the vailidty of the flat - field correction as it contains a very low - level isotropic background of galactic line emission . in the survey image",
    "this will be moderated by the filter response .",
    "figure  [ hal0410]a - b shows two 16@xmath25 blocked down images of survey field h410 . the top image figure  [ hal0410]a is the raw  data , before the application of the flat - field correction .",
    "the structure evident on the field as lighter areas is not galactic emission but matches the filter transmission profile .",
    "the two horizontal bars are present and the image is less exposed towards the corners where the recorded intensity is lower and the star density also falls .",
    "the bright star just to the right of centre is @xmath26 lupi .",
    "application of the flat - field correction results in figure  [ hal0410]b which should have a flat background wash of emission across it .",
    "the structure from the filter is no longer evident and the bright areas are now in the corners , where the larger flat - field correction over - corrects the supercosmos intensity counts .",
    "this will not adversely affect the majority of the pixel data available on the shs website .",
    "data can always be taken from the best area of filter response and no flat - field correction larger than 15 per cent is necessary for any of the survey data that overlap a neighbouring field .",
    "data from the edge of the survey , where no adjacent field exists , have been made available and may require a correction greater than 15% .",
    "areas affected in this way are flagged in the third extension table which accompanies the downloaded fits image .",
    "geocoronal  emission is caused by fluorescence after solar lyman  @xmath27 excitation of atomic hydrogen in the exosphere .",
    "because imaging surveys lack velocity resolution for the emission they record , the geocoronal contribution will be present in all of them but indistinguishable from bona fide galactic  emission .",
    "fortunately , one modern  survey , wham ( e.g. haffner et al . 2003 ) , offers very good velocity resolution ( @xmath012  km / s ) and is able to separate the atmospheric emission from the galactic emission and measure the intensity .",
    "nossal et al . ( 2001 ) report on  observations carried out by the wham instrument in 1997 , the same time as the shs imaging was starting at the ukst .",
    "they find that the geocoronal emission intensity depends on how much the earth shades the line of sight from sunlight .",
    "their resulting plot of geocoronal  emission as a function of earth shadow height shows that at heights greater than 6000  km only a very low level @xmath02  r wash of geocoronal  emission is present .",
    "based on the observational information available in the headers of the shs images , it is possible to calculate the shadow heights for any field . for a random sample of 6 shs fields the shadow height for the whole three hour observation and across the five - degree field of view",
    "was found to be greater than 6000  km , so low - level geocoronal emission is not problematic , as most galactic plane fields covered by the shs will contain significantly stronger emission .",
    "the aao / ukst  survey data needs an absolute intensity calibration if the full scientific value of its sensitivity to faint , diffuse emission is to be realized .",
    "the intensity calibration must provide a reliable means of transforming the pixel intensity values from supercosmos scans of the  images into meaningful intensity units such as rayleighs which is consistent from field to field .",
    "we show that continuum emission can be successfully removed from the images by scaling and subtracting the sr continuum image . unlike ccd data , which enjoys a linear response over a wide range of emission strength",
    ", photographic data can be very difficult to calibrate because the response of the emulsion and  scanner is linear only over a relatively small dynamic range .",
    "variations in sensitivity and background occur from exposure to exposure , especially when the  and sr pairs were taken on different nights , phases of the moon etc . despite this , we show that the survey data have been well exposed to capture galactic emission on the linear part of the characteristic curve and can be calibrated by means of comparison with the complementary , accurately intensity calibrated shassa survey ( gaustad et al .",
    "this process does not form part of the current shs release but can be undertaken by the user as required .      the southern  sky survey atlas by gaustad et al .",
    "( 2001 ) provides wide - field narrow - band ccd  images of the southern sky below @xmath28",
    "=  + 15  taken with a robotic imaging camera sited at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "the camera used a small , fast , f/1.6 canon lens which gave a very large ( 13 ) field of view and a spatial resolution of 48  arcseconds .",
    "each shassa field was imaged through a narrow - band interference filter of width 32centred at 6563 as well as a continuum filter with two bands of 61  at 6440  and 6770 , on either side the line .",
    "the shassa website makes available the raw  and continuum images as well as 48  arcsecond and 4  arcminute resolution continuum subtracted , intensity calibrated data .",
    "the shs data is superior in terms of resolution while the general sensitivity of both surveys appears qualitatively similar for large - scale emission features .",
    "for example , in figure  [ shassa - shs ] we present shs and shassa images of the hii region rcw  19 .",
    "the shassa intensity calibration was derived from the planetary nebula spectrophotometric standards of dopita & hua ( 1997 ) after the continuum images had been scaled and subtracted from the  frames .",
    "aperture photometry for eighteen of the bright pne standards was measured from the shassa images and used to calculate the calibration factor for the whole survey .",
    "a difficulty in applying pne line fluxes to  narrow - band imaging is the proximity of the two [ nii ]  @xmath296548 ,  6584 lines which are included in the flanks of the shassa  filter bandpass .",
    "these vary in strength relative to  between pne and could significantly affect the result . calculating the transmission properties of the interference filter to these lines",
    "is complicated by the blue - shifting of the bandpass with incident angle , an effect which must be treated carefully in the shs data as the filter sits in the fast f/2.48 beam of the ukst .",
    "this problem is not as severe for the shassa data because in this case the filter sits in front of the camera lens , leaving only the effects of the very large field of view .",
    "these effects are considered in section  4 of gaustad et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and carefully accounted for in their calibration .    to allow a more detailed comparison , aperture photometry for 87 pne with a range of surface brightness and integrated flux and with an independent measure of h@xmath7 flux , was carried out on shassa images .",
    "published spectroscopic data were used to deconvolve the contribution from the [ n ii ] lines passed by the shassa filter .",
    "the results agree with published data to @xmath30  f(h@xmath7 )  =  0.01dex , @xmath31 = 0.05 for shassa minus literature fluxes ( frew 2005 , in preparation ; cf . pierce et al .",
    "since the pne literature fluxes have associated errors , the shassa calibration is better than @xmath32 per cent across the whole survey , in agreement with the nominal error supplied by gaustad et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "an additional uncertainty is introduced to the zero - point of the shassa intensity calibration from the contribution of geocoronal emission .",
    "gaustad et al .",
    "( 2001 ) estimate this by comparison with overlapping wham data points and interpolating where there are none .",
    "our check of the intensity calibration against independent flux measures of planetary nebulae indicates that the geocoronal contribution to the shassa  images has been successfully removed .",
    "finkbeiner ( 2003 ) also showed there is no significant offset between wham and shassa data .",
    "so we conclude that the shassa data has been well calibrated to a zero - point consistent with independent measurements and therefore have confidence in its use as a baseline calibration for the shs data .",
    "diffuse emission recorded through the narrow - band  filter on the tech - pan films will be a combination of galactic  line emission , continuum emission , night - sky auroral lines and geocoronal emission .",
    "ideally all of these components would need to be disentangled to extract just the galactic  emission . in practice",
    "the geocoronal and auroral emission is considered as a low ( @xmath33  r ) level but temporally varying uniform wash which simply elevates the general background on each exposure to a slightly varying degree .",
    "the matching sr images provide a measure of the continuum component and , properly scaled , can be used to produce continuum subtracted  images . although the  and sr exposures are generally exposed to attain the same depth for continuum point sources , the nature of photography and the vagaries of the observing conditions ( e.g. if the exposure pairs were not contemporaneous and taken in different moon phases or if the seeing changed ) mean that the depth and image quality between the  and sr exposures can and does vary .",
    "hence it is necessary to determine a continuum subtraction scaling factor between  and sr on a field by field basis .",
    "this factor must be precisely determined for the continuum subtraction to be effective . for high - dynamic range ccd exposures ,",
    "the standard method for determining the appropriate scaling factor to subtract continuum from narrow - band is to compare aperture photometry for stars on both images whose exposures are normally interleaved on short timescales .",
    "unfortunately , this does not work well with the  sr film exposure pairs ( pierce 2005 ) , often leading to under or over - subtraction of the continuum .",
    "this arises due to varying backgrounds on the film exposures caused by ; low - level emulsion sensitivity variations between films ( especially if they come from different hypersensitised batches ) , inherent chemical fog variations in the emulsion , processing variations and true sky background variations arising for the reasons given above .",
    "these varying backgrounds result in the same magnitude stars saturating at different levels on different exposures as their gaussian point spread functions are superimposed on top of any diffuse emission and elevated background which can severely truncate their peaks .",
    "the limited dynamic range of  also acts as a further low ceiling above the background , which leaves little room for these bright stellar gaussians making it hard to effectively utilise stellar photometry to determine the correct scaling factors .",
    "fortunately , we are able to use the existing shassa data to provide a well - determined scale with an independently confirmed zero - point to compare with and calibrate the shs images .",
    "even exposure pairs taken years apart can be successfully continuum subtracted .",
    "a detailed investigation of the shs calibration process has been undertaken by pierce ( 2005 ) but the essential aspects of this process and its application are given here .",
    "for example , figure  [ 1647m4900_2 ] shows three images of a 30  arcminute region taken from field h350 , which shows strong , varying galactic  emission .",
    "the top image is the  image downloaded from the shs website , the middle image is its sr counterpart while the bottom image has had the sr ` continuum ' image scaled and subtracted via a comparison with shassa data . in general",
    "this subtraction is very good , removing most of the stellar images and the diffuse continuum . only the stars which sit in the strongest emission",
    "have been over - subtracted and appear as white spots in the image .    for a given area of sky ,",
    "pixel data from each survey can be downloaded and , after matching for spatial resolution , the  intensity counts can be compared directly with the rayleigh values in the shassa data .",
    "a plot of continuum - subtracted shassa pixels against equivalent shs pixels should return a linear relation with a common zero point if the reduction and intensity calibration have been properly carried out .",
    "comparing incorrectly continuum - subtracted shs data with shassa data results in an offset between the two surveys .",
    "a range of values for the scaling factor can be applied to the shs data until the zero - point of the continuum - subtracted ukst survey images best matches the zero - point of the equivalent shassa data , indicating the appropriate value to use .",
    "a calibration based on the shassa data will provide an advantage for the shs over the ctio survey as it can be applied to the full resolution pixel data .",
    "this offers the chance to determine intensities for emission structures not resolved by shassa such as the new sample of extended pne discovered from the shs data ( e.g. parker et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 , pierce et al .",
    "2004 , frew & parker , in preparation and see section 14.1 ) .",
    "each scanned shs survey field , at the full 0.67  arcsecond resolution , contains over 2  gb of data so it was not practical to download and compare all the pixel data for each field .",
    "instead , most of the emission variation on a given survey field can be sampled using carefully selected 30  arcminute regions . for fifteen fields , several 30  arcminute areas were downloaded to sample the complete dynamic range of emission present .",
    "once the scaling reliability over a range of flux levels and central aperture locations was established , the best single , 30  arcminute region was chosen from the whole frame for the rest of the 233 survey fields to provide the base calibration for each field .",
    "the  filter flat - field correction was applied to remove the low - level non - uniformities in transmission across the narrow - band filter .",
    "data requiring a flat - field correction of up to 15 per cent have been shown to be suitable for inclusion in the survey , though in most cases data returned from the shs website require less correction than this .",
    "for the regions considered here , the pixel data only required flat - field correction @xmath34 per cent in most cases and , in general , no more than 8 per cent . for two fields , h350 and h1109 regions well away from the best area of the filter",
    "were also selected to confirm that the pixel data behaves as expected when larger flat - field corrections are required .",
    "the results are discussed below .",
    "a detailed description of the shs survey calibration process based on zero - pointing each shs field to shassa is given in the thesis of pierce ( 2005 ) .",
    "the essentials of this scheme are described here .",
    "each shs field is completely covered by just one 13  shassa field and data from the best area of shassa filter response was chosen for comparison with the shs images . for direct comparison ,",
    "the  and sr shs data at 0.67  arcsecond was re - binned to match the 48  arcsecond shassa pixels using the idl routine hrebin .",
    "this returns the mean value of the 72@xmath2572 full resolution shs pixels that constitute a single shassa 48  arcsecond pixel , so the calibration factor determined from the comparison plot applies to the full resolution shs data . at this coarse resolution",
    "the sr data was scaled and subtracted from the  image . because the correct scaling factor was not yet known , a range of scaling factors from 0.4 to 2.0 was applied so that the best value could be selected by matching the shassa zero - point .",
    "the equivalent area of shassa data was selected , aligned and trimmed to match using the idl , hastrom routine .",
    "these images were then compared directly , pixel by pixel , with the re - binned , continuum - subtracted shs data to give a plot of shassa values in rayleighs versus supercosmos counts per re - binned pixel .",
    "the linear portion of the resulting comparison was then fitted to determine the number of  counts per 0.67  arcsecond pixel per rayleigh .",
    "averaging  data in this way only works properly if all the   pixels are on the linear portion of the characteristic curve at the faint end and unsaturated at the bright end .",
    "once the  dynamic range is exceeded pixel saturation arises and the shassa to  linear relation breaks down as the  flux becomes increasingly underestimated ( e.g. phillipps & parker , 1993 ) as seen in figure  [ hal0350calib ] .",
    "the adopted process was followed for the same 30  arcminute region from shs field h350 as shown in figure  [ 1647m4900_2 ] .",
    "the upper image in figure  [ 1647m4900_48 ] shows the shs image with the continuum - subtracted at 48  arcsecond resolution .",
    "the lower image is the trimmed and aligned shassa data .",
    "bright stars on the continuum subtracted shassa images leave significant residuals while in the shs data any stellar residuals are barely visible and then only for the very brightest stars . the pixel - to - pixel comparison plot for this area",
    "is shown in figure  [ 1647m4900_calib ] .",
    "each point on this plot is the pixel value from the supercosmos scan against the rayleigh value from the shassa data .",
    "immediately , it can be seen that the shs data follows a tight linear relation with the shassa values over a range of several hundred rayleighs .",
    "the outliers from this distribution at around 4000 supercosmos counts correspond to the shassa stellar residuals noted from figure  [ 1647m4900_48 ] .",
    "= 7.0 cm = 6.5 cm    = 0.35    a further nine 30  arcminute areas were examined from field h350 to cover the whole dynamic range of diffuse emission evident in the field .",
    "figure  [ hal0350areas ] shows the 16@xmath25 blocked down  image for this field with contours of filter response overlaid and boxes indicating the areas used .",
    "the large area of strong emission in the west of this field is caused by the uv flux from ob association ara  1a  a ( melnik & efremov 1995 ) . in all but two cases the areas were selected from the best area of the filter response , the exception being the two areas extracted from the se corner which were included to test the effect of using pixel data from the edge of the shs survey fields where the flat - field correction is larger .    figure  [ hal0350calib ] shows the resulting shassa versus shs comparison plot with differently shaded points belonging to different 30  arcminute areas .",
    "almost the full range of the shs data is shown , with the pixel values showing a good linear relation to the shassa data from the faintest emission on the field at @xmath020rayleighs right up to @xmath0500rayleighs .",
    "the curve in the trend beyond 500rayleighs is due to saturation effects with the shs data .",
    "these points were discarded when making the calibration fit .",
    "the reciprocal of the slope of the linear part of the relation provides a calibration factor of 15.1  counts / pixel / rayleigh to convert the supercosmos intensity counts to rayleighs for this field .",
    "an estimate of the error in this calibration is possible , based on the vertical scatter of points about this trend , as a given  value matches a rayleigh value in this vertical distribution . in this field",
    "the 1@xmath31 scatter is 21rayleighs .    the data taken from the two areas in the se corner of the shs survey field required flat - field correction of up to 20 per cent .",
    "they behave very well when compared with the data requiring less correction , neatly overlaying the main trend , with no change in slope or increase in scatter .",
    "this justifies use of the data out to the 15 per cent flat - field contour where the emulsion records strong emission .",
    "while the results from field h350 have shown that the survey has been well tuned to the detection of diffuse emission , as well as giving an approximate limit to the point at which the photographic emulsion saturates , the faint limit has not yet been constrained because there is no really faint emission on this field . at the faintest point of 20rayleighs",
    "there is no sign of either survey struggling for sensitivity so a field exhibiting fainter emission is required to probe the shs faint sensitivity limit .",
    "according to the shassa data an area of the southern galactic plane in monoceros harbours diffuse emission that reaches a level as faint as @xmath02rayleighs , which is ideal to test the faint limit of the shs data .",
    "figure  [ hal1109areas ] shows the 16 times blocked down image of shs field h1109 , which covers this area of sky , with contours of filter response and the areas selected shown as with figure  [ hal0350areas ] . on this field , nine 30  arcminute regions have been examined as two groups : one , labelled 15 in figure  [ hal1109areas ] , from the area of best filter response and the other , labelled a  d , probing the combined effects of extremely low levels of emission and decreased filter transmission .",
    "the comparison plot from the first group is shown in figure  [ hal1109calib ] .",
    "once again , there is a clearly defined relation between the two , although on this faint field the upper saturation limit is not reached .",
    "it is immediately obvious that the shs data can match the shassa data right down to the faintest level of emission , although the linear response of the shs data is difficult to determine at this low level .",
    "the shs data are therefore detecting emission structure as faint as 2rayleighs on this field , although this sensitivity is tempered by the scatter evident in the plot and in the examination of the areas from the area of poor filter transmission discussed below .",
    "the linear fit returns a value of @xmath35  counts / pixel / rayleigh for this particular field and provides a reasonable calibration as the 1@xmath31 scatter to the fit is just 6.2rayleighs .",
    "note the factor of two difference in the slope of the calibration curve for this low emission level field h1109 ( no emission measure greater than about 80 rayleighs seen in the area considered ) compared to that obtained for high emission field h350 in figure  [ hal0350calib ] , which returned 15.1 counts / pixel / rayleigh , which is closer to that generally obtained for most fields .",
    "this serves to emphasise the need for individual field calibration due to the variation in  pixel intensities on a given field , arising primarily from variable fog - level , sky background and resulting  and emulsion saturation .",
    "= 7.0 cm      a total of fifteen fields from a wide variety of galactic environments were studied using several 30  arcminute regions in each in order to build up a global picture of the survey behaviour .",
    "the comparison plots for 4 of these are shown in figure  [ fourcomp ] with the linear fit overlaid . in each case a clear , essentially linear relation can be seen between the shs and shassa data .",
    "generally , different 30  arcminute regions follow a single trend which indicates little variation in emulsion sensitivity across the large shs images .",
    "three of the fields examined , h175 , h350 and h555 show evidence for saturation at the bright end and fix the bright limit at @xmath0500 to @xmath0600rayleighs , while none of the fields appear to reach the background fog level in the areas that were compared .      from the analysis of the fifteen fields considered above , it is clear that each field requires individual calibration and that one , well selected , 30  arcminute area of shs pixel data",
    "can be compared with shassa to give a working estimate of the calibration factor and a satisfactory result in most cases . on this basis",

    "<S> the uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) of the anglo - australian observatory completed a narrow - band  plus [ nii ]  6548 , 6584  survey of the southern galactic plane and magellanic clouds in late 2003 . </S>",
    "<S> the survey , which was the last ukst wide - field photographic survey , and the only one undertaken in a narrow band , is now an on - line digital data product of the wide - field astronomy unit of the royal observatory edinburgh ( roe ) . </S>",
    "<S> the survey utilised a high specification , monolithic  interference band - pass filter of exceptional quality . in conjunction with the fine grained tech - pan film as a detector </S>",
    "<S> it has produced a survey with a powerful combination of area coverage ( 4000 square degrees ) , resolution ( @xmath01  arcsecond ) and sensitivity ( @xmath15  rayleighs ) , reaching a depth for continuum point sources of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the main survey consists of 233 individual fields on a grid of centres separated by 4   at declinations below + 2  and covers a swathe approximately 20  wide about the southern galactic plane . </S>",
    "<S> the original survey films were scanned by the supercosmos measuring machine at the royal observatory , edinburgh to provide the on - line digital atlas called the supercosmos  survey ( shs ) . </S>",
    "<S> we present the background to the survey , the key survey characteristics , details and examples of the data product , calibration process , comparison with other surveys and a brief description of its potential for scientific exploitation .    </S>",
