    "big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) is one of the most important tools to probe the early universe .",
    "because it is very sensitive to the condition of the universe from @xmath3 sec to @xmath4 sec , we can indirectly check the history of the universe and impose constraints on a hypothetical particles by the observational light element abundances .",
    "there are a lot of models of the modern particle physics beyond the standard model , e.g. supergravity or superstring theory , which predict unstable massive particles with masses of @xmath5(100 gev ) , such as gravitino , polonyi field , moduli , and so on .",
    "they have long lifetimes because their interactions are suppressed by inverse powers of the gravitational scale .",
    "consequently , these exotic particles may decay at about the bbn epoch ( @xmath6mev ) .",
    "if the massive particles radiatively decays , the emitted high energy photons induce the electromagnetic cascade process .",
    "if the decay occurs after the bbn starts , the light elements would be destroyed by the cascade photons and their abundances would be changed significantly . comparing the",
    "theoretically predicted light element abundances with the observational ones , we can impose constrains on the energy density , the mass , and the lifetime of the parent massive particle  @xcite .",
    "in particular , holtmann and the present authors  @xcite performed the maximum likelihood analysis including both theoretical and observational errors and obtained the precise constraints .",
    "after ref .",
    "@xcite was published , several new observational data of light elements were reported . as for the @xmath7he abundance",
    ", it was still unclear whether the observational value of the primordial @xmath7he mass fraction @xmath8 is low ( @xmath9 0.234 )  @xcite or high ( @xmath9 0.244 )  @xcite .",
    "however , fields and olive considered the hei absorption effect and reanalyzed the data  @xcite , and they obtained a relatively middle value of @xmath8 ( @xmath10 ) . on the other hand , as for the primordial d / h , although low values of d / h ( @xmath11 )  @xcite had been measured and regarded as the primordial abundance , a relatively high value of d / h ( @xmath12 ) was claimed again by tytler et al .  in the high redshift qso absorption systems  @xcite . in their paper",
    "they stressed that while the data may be inadequate to definitely conclude it to be precise value , there is still a possibility of the high d / h .    on the theoretical side , recently it was claimed that the severest constraint on the radiatively - decaying particle may be from the non - thermal production of @xmath1li , which is a secondary @xmath1li production due to the background @xmath2 and the energetic t or @xmath13 produced by the @xmath2 photodissociation .",
    "however , the observational data of the primordial component of @xmath1li has large uncertainties .",
    "in addition , precise experimental data for the nuclear cross sections are not available .",
    "therefore , it is unclear how important the non - thermal @xmath1li production is once we take account of these uncertainties .    with these new developments in theory and observation ,",
    "we revise the previous constraint on the radiative decay of long - lived particles .",
    "we obtain the photon spectrum by solving the boltzmann equation numerically  @xcite .",
    "in addition we perform the monte carlo simulation which includes both the experimental and theoretical errors . then , we estimate the confidence levels by performing the maximum likelihood method including both the theoretical and the observational errors .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the current status of the observational data . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce the formulations for the photodissociation and non - thermal @xmath1li production . in sec .",
    "iv we compare the theoretical predictions with the observations .",
    "sec  v is devoted to conclusions .",
    "here we summarize the current status of the observational light element abundances .",
    "the primordial d / h is measured in the high redshift qso absorption systems .",
    "recently a new deuterium data was obtained from observation of qso hs 0105 + 1619 at z = 2.536  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the cloud is neutral and has a simple structure .",
    "five lyman series transitions caused by d and h were observed there .",
    "the reported value of the deuterium abundance was relatively low , ( d / h)@xmath14 . combined with the previous `` low d '' data which were obtained by the clouds at z = 3.572 towards q1937 - 1009 and at z = 2.504 towards q1009 + 2956  @xcite , the primordial abundance is obtained as @xmath15 we call this value `` low d. '' on the other hand , webb et al .",
    "oobserved high deuterium abundance in relatively low redshift absorption systems at z = 0.701 towards q1718 + 4807  @xcite , @xmath16 tytler et al .",
    "@xcite also observed the clouds independently and obtained the similar value . since webb et al .  and tytler et al .",
    "did not obtain the full spectra of the lyman series in their observations , the precise fitting of d / h based on the `` high d '' data might be inadequate .",
    "however , the possibility of `` high d '' have not been excluded yet .",
    "therefore , we also consider the possibility of `` high d '' and include it in our analysis .    for @xmath17he",
    ", we use the pre - solar measurements . in this paper",
    ", we do not rely upon models of galactic and stellar chemical evolution because of the large uncertainty in extrapolating back to the primordial abundance .",
    "but it is reasonable to assume that @xmath17he / d is an increasing function of the cosmic time , because d is the most fragile isotope and is always destroyed whenever @xmath17he is destroyed . using the solar - system data reanalyzed by geiss  @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the pre - solar abundance .",
    "we take this to be an upper bound on the primordial @xmath17he to d ratio @xmath20 : @xmath21 although in the standard scenario the theoretical prediction satisfies the above constraint , @xmath7he photodissociation produces both d and @xmath17he and can raise the @xmath17he to d ratio  @xcite .",
    "hence , we include this constraint into our analysis .",
    "the primordial @xmath7he mass fraction @xmath8 is inferred from observation of recombination lines from the low metallicity extragalactic hii regions .",
    "since @xmath7he is produced with oxygen in stars , the primordial value is obtained to regress to the zero metallicity o / h @xmath22 for the observational data .",
    "recently , fields and olive  @xcite reanalyzed the data including the hei absorption effect and they obtained @xmath23 where the first error is the statistical uncertainty and the second error is the systematic one .",
    "we adopt the above value as the observational @xmath8 .",
    "the primordial @xmath24li / h is observed in the pop ii old halo stars .",
    "we adopt the recent measurements by bonifacio and molaro  @xcite @xmath25        = -9.76 \\pm ( 0.012)_{stat } \\pm ( 0.05)_{syst } \\pm ( 0.3)_{add}.\\ ] ] here we have added the additional uncertainty for fear that @xmath26 in halo stars might have been supplemented ( by production in cosmic - ray interactions ) or depleted ( in stars )  @xcite .    it is much more difficult to observe the primordial component of @xmath1li because @xmath1li is so much rarer than @xmath24li .",
    "unfortunately , enough data have not been obtained to find the `` spite plateau '' of @xmath1li .",
    "however , we can set an upper bound on @xmath1li/@xmath24li , since it is generally believed that the evolution of @xmath1li is dominated by the production through p,@xmath27-c , n , o cosmic ray spallation ( reactions of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium ) .",
    "intrinsically the models of the nucleosynthesis through the cosmic ray spallation were motivated to simultaneously agree with whole the observational li - be - b abundances  @xcite . on the other hand , recently it was claimed that the observational @xmath1li abundance in halo stars is too abundant from the point of view of the cosmic ray energy if @xmath28be is fit by the model of the cosmic - ray metal  @xcite .",
    "therefore , there seems to be some uncertainties in the models of the cosmic ray spallation . in this situation , however , at least it would be safe to assume that @xmath1li abundance increases as the metallicity increases .",
    "today we observe only the @xmath1li to @xmath24li ratio in low - metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath29 ) halo stars  @xcite , @xmath30 we take this value as an upper bound on the primordial value @xmath31 , @xmath32",
    "in order to discuss the effect of high - energy photons on bbn , we need the shape of the photon spectrum induced by the primary high - energy photons from the decay of the massive particle @xmath33 . in the thermal bath ( mixture of photons @xmath34 , electrons @xmath35 , and nucleons @xmath36 ) ,",
    "high energy photons lose their energy by the following cascade processes :    * double - photon pair creation ( @xmath37 ) * photon - photon scattering ( @xmath38 ) * pair creation in nuclei ( @xmath39 ) * compton scattering ( @xmath40 ) * inverse compton scattering ( @xmath41 )    in this study we numerically solved the boltzmann equation including the above processes , and obtained the distribution function of photons , @xmath42 .",
    "the cascade photons induce the photodissociation of the light elements , which modifies the result of standard bbn ( sbbn ) .",
    "the evolutions of the light nuclei abundances are governed by the following boltzmann equation : @xmath43_{\\rm sbbn }      - n_n \\sum_{n'}\\int de_\\gamma      \\sigma_{n\\gamma\\rightarrow n'}(e_\\gamma ) f_\\gamma ( e_\\gamma )     \\nonumber \\\\ & &      + \\sum_{n''}n_{n '' } \\int de_\\gamma      \\sigma_{n''\\gamma\\rightarrow n } ( e_\\gamma ) f_\\gamma ( e_\\gamma),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the number density of the nuclei @xmath45 , and @xmath46_{\\rm sbbn}$ ] denotes the sbbn contribution to the boltzmann equation . in table",

    "then they have a relationship @xmath54 . ] in this paper we assume that @xmath33 decays only into photons , i.e. , @xmath55 corresponds to @xmath56 .",
    "then , the photodissociation rates depend on the combination @xmath55 which characterizes the amount of the energy of the injected photons @xmath57 as far as @xmath49 is much larger than 20 mev  @xcite .",
    "as pointed out by jedamzik  @xcite , both @xmath58 and @xmath13 are produced through the photodissociation of @xmath2 , @xmath59 they are still energetic and have kinetic energies enough to produce @xmath1li through the following processes with the background @xmath2 : @xmath60 until they are stopped by the ionization loss through the plasma excitation in the electromagnetic plasma .",

    "@xmath70 denotes the rate of the ionization loss while the charged particle @xmath58 is running a distance @xmath71 in the electromagnetic plasma .",

    "the effect of the process ( [ eq : li6_he3 ] ) is described by replacing the suffix @xmath58 with @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dn6_dt ] ) .",
    "we include the above two processes of the non - thermal @xmath1li production in bbn code and compute the @xmath1li abundance . in the computation we adopt the experimental cross section @xmath80 mb  @xcite commonly for the two processes .",
    "because we have only one data point at the kinetic energy @xmath81 = 28 mev in the laboratory system , we assume that the cross section is constant for whole the energy region and neglect its energy dependence .",
    "then , we integrate the second factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dn6_dt ] ) up to a high energy .",
    "one can easily find that there exists a serious problem in this procedure if it is compared to the case of the original photodissociation where the photodissociation rates steeply decrease as the energy increases .",
    "because we have the experimental data for the @xmath2 photodissociation rates only up to about 100 mev for the photon energy  @xcite , we should interpolate the photodissociation rates in a high energy region because of the mild dumping of the integrand .",
    "then , the integration has a large uncertainty ( @xmath9 20 @xmath82 ) when we change the upper limit of the integration from 500 mev to 1 gev .",
    "therefore , in this situation we adopt 20@xmath82 errors for the non - thermal @xmath1li production rates and perform the monte carlo simulation including them .",
    "decreases at high energy like other nuclear interactions , the @xmath1li production is less important . as shown later , the resultant constraint is not changed even if we neglect the @xmath1li production . ]      in addition to the photodissociation process , there also exists an another constraint .",
    "a radiative decay process releases a net photon energy into the electromagnetic plasma .",
    "the emitted photons should be thermalized soon , otherwise the photon spectrum deviates from the blackbody , which contradicts the observation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite .",
    "this leads to the following constraints : @xmath83 for @xmath84-distortion ( @xmath85 ) , and @xmath86 for @xmath87-distortion ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : pn67 ] we plot the theoretically predicted @xmath1li to @xmath24li ratio ( @xmath89 ) in ( @xmath48 , @xmath90 ) plane .",
    "the solid line represents the model parameters which predict the observational mean value of @xmath91 and the dashed line denotes the observational 2-@xmath92 upper bound .",
    "from the figure , one may think that the mean value of the theoretical prediction constrains @xmath90 severely .",
    "we should bear in mind , however , that the theoretical prediction has a large uncertainty which comes from the errors of the production rates , and in addition the observational constraint also has a large error . to take account of these uncertainties",
    "systematically , we performed the maximum likelihood analysis  @xcite including both the theoretical and the observational errors .",
    "here we assume that the theoretical predictions of ( d / h)@xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 $ ] , @xmath96 , and @xmath91 obey the gaussian probability distribution functions ( p.d.f.s ) with the widths given by the 1-@xmath92 errors . concerning the observational values , ( d / h)@xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 $ ]",

    "the dotted line denotes the upper bound from the cmb constraint . in the figure ,",
    "the region below the lines are consistent with the observations .",
    "the constraint from the cmb is almost always weaker than that from bbn .",
    "the main feature of the difference between high d and low d is that the low d constraint is severer than high d for a relatively long lifetime case ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "that is because high d constraint modestly allows the overproduction of @xmath13 accompanying the @xmath2 photodissociation . on the other hand ,",
    "the high d constraint is more stringent for shorter lifetimes since the d dissociation is more important than the @xmath2 photodissociation .",
    "the obtained upper bound does not change our earlier results so much @xcite .",
    "it became slightly weaker because we included the @xmath47 dependence for the photodissociation rates ( @xmath102 ) in this analysis .",
    "dependence is understood as follows .",
    "the soft photons produced in the electromagnetic cascade scatter off the background electrons and nucleons and lose their energy .",
    "thus the number density of soft photons with energy larger than the threshold decreases as scattering rate which is proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the photodissociation rates are proportional to @xmath103 .",
    "] we find that the non - thermally produced @xmath1li mildly contributes to the bound .",
    "sec , and decays into @xmath13 whose charge is two .",
    "thus , because @xmath13 subjects to stop easier than @xmath58 by the ionization loss , we might overestimate the @xmath104 production in parameter regions where the stopping time @xmath105 is longer than the lifetime of tritium , i.e. , for @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , at a long lifetime @xmath107 , our constraint might become weaker by about factor two .",
    "however , it is expected that the effect would not change the result significantly because the @xmath13 overproduction gives a severer constraint there . ]",
    "the main reason is that both the theoretical computation and observational data have very large uncertainties which amount to about 30",
    " 40 @xmath82 .    assuming that the parent massive particle is the gravitino and that it dominantly decays into a photon and a photino ( @xmath108 ) , the lifetime @xmath109 is related to the gravitino mass @xmath110 as @xmath111 assuming that the gravitino is produced through the thermal scattering in the reheating process after inflation",

    "we can obtain the upper bound on the reheating temperature : @xmath116 at 95@xmath82 c.l .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effects on primordial nucleosynthesis of the radiative decay of a long - lived massive particle @xmath33 using new observational data .",
    "we have also considered the non - thermal @xmath104 production caused by energetic t and @xmath13 produced by the @xmath2 photodissociation .",
    "we obtained the photon spectrum through the electromagnetic cascade process by solving a set of boltzmann equations numerically .",
    "in addition , to estimate the theoretical errors we performed monte carlo simulation including the theoretical uncertainties which come from those of nuclear reaction rates . to obtain the degree of agreements between theory and observation , we performed the maximum likelihood method and the @xmath100 fitting including both the observational and theoretical errors .    as a result",
    "we have obtained the upper bound on the abundance @xmath55 as a function of its lifetime @xmath48 .",
