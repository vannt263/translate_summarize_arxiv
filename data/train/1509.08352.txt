    "the cluster algorithms have been proposed to overcome the critical slowing down . the dynamical critical exponent @xmath4(@xmath5 ) in the local - update algorithms",
    "was reported to be reduced of one order by the cluster algorithms  @xcite . in numerical calculations ,",
    "this exponent was evaluated from size dependence of the correlation time of equilibrium autocorrelation functions of physical quantities at the critical temperature , @xmath6 .",
    "it was gradually revealed that to distinguish power - law behavior with such a small exponent from logarithmic behavior , @xmath7 , is quite difficult  @xcite .",
    "then , larger - scale calculations based on nonequilibrium relaxation ( ner )  @xcite showed  @xcite that a critical relaxation faster than power law ( symbolically represented as @xmath8 ) might exist in the cluster algorithms .",
    "quite recently , the present authors showed that the explicit form of such a nontrivial critical relaxation is given by the stretched - exponential time dependence , initially in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) ising model in the wolff algorithm from the perfectly - ordered state  @xcite , and then in the 3d heisenberg model in the swendsen - wang ( sw ) algorithm from the perfectly - disordered state  @xcite .    in the standard ner based on the local - update algorithms ,",
    "a physical quantity of large enough size shows a power - law critical relaxation @xmath9 , with the critical exponent @xmath10 of the quantity @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the correlation length for decaying ( @xmath13 ) or ordering ( @xmath14 ) processes .",
    "the critical temperature can be evaluated from the power - law behavior ( or linearity of the @xmath15-@xmath15 plot ) , and the critical exponents can be obtained from the mixed exponents of some quantities and scaling relations .",
    "once the functional form of the critical relaxation in the cluster ner is established , analysis similar to that in the standard ner becomes possible , and the critical temperature can be evaluated from the stretched - exponential behavior  @xcite .",
    "however , the critical exponents are not included in the stretched - exponential time dependence , and such information can be obtained only from the nonequilibrium - to - equilibrium scaling  @xcite , a kind of finite - size scaling which couples the short - time critical relaxation and equilibrium size dependence .",
    "although this procedure ensures the nontrivial stretched - exponential behavior in the cluster ner , necessity of multiple sizes is not so favorable as the standard ner , and necessity of relaxation data until the vicinity of equilibrium is also not favorable because numerical merit in comparison with conventional equilibrium simulations becomes obscure .    in the present article",
    "we numerically show that the essential merit of the cluster ner is exhibited in the berezinsky - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) and weak first - order phase transitions .",
    "critical relaxation behaviors in the cluster ner are qualitatively different in the bkt or weak first - order phase transitions and in the second - order phase transition , and nontrivial physical results can be obtained only from initial relaxation behaviors .    the outline of the present article is as follows . in section",

    ", we calculate this time dependence in the 2d , 3d and 4d xy models , and show that the peculiar behavior in 2d characterizes the bkt phase transition . in section iv , critical relaxation in the 2d @xmath1-sate potts models are compared with each other for @xmath16 , and the qualitative difference between @xmath2 ( second - order phase transition ) and @xmath17 ( first - order phase transition ) is displayed .",

    "in the present article the 2d potts models are analyzed with the sw algorithm  @xcite , and the xy models are treated with the  embedded - ising - spin \" scheme proposed by wolff  @xcite , although spin clusters are generated in the whole system after the sw algorithm , not after wolff s single - cluster scheme ( the so - called wolff algorithm )  @xcite . since the purpose of the present article is to exhibit nontrivial critical relaxation in the bkt and weak first - order phase transitions , here we do not intend to evaluate the critical temperature @xmath18 precisely .",
