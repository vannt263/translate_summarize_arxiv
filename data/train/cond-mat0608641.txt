    "dense , gravity - driven granular flows down an inclined plane  @xcite achieved the status of a key model system because of their relevance to many geological and industrial applications .",
    "provided that the surface of the incline is sufficiently rough and the flow height is small compared to the width and length of the chute , such that transients and side - wall effects can be neglected , the flow behavior is controlled by the angle of inclination , @xmath2 , and granular layer thickness @xmath3 . for a given @xmath2",
    "the flow is possible only for @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath1 is often referred to as the deposit function , because it is approximately equal to the thickness of the deposit remaining on the plane once the flow is stopped either due to the decrease of @xmath2 or decrease of @xmath3 .",
    "recent experimental and numerical studies confirmed that for spherical grains , the depth - averaged steady state velocity of the flow @xmath5 can be related to the deposit function through the following relationship , originally proposed by pouliquen  @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the gravitational acceleration and @xmath8 .",
    "this relationship suggests that a single scaling length controls both the deposit function and the rheology .",
    "a potential explanation of this scaling length as arising from correlations in granular motion was advanced by some of us  @xcite , linking a correlation length in the flow to a rheologically defined `` viscosity length scale '' , @xmath9 , defined by the bagnold scaling form  @xcite @xmath10 for a granular system with bulk density @xmath11 , flowing under a shear stress @xmath12 at a shear rate @xmath13 .",
    "alternatively , it has recently been argued  @xcite that for a granular system made of particles of diameter @xmath14 and grain density @xmath15 flowing while subject to a pressure @xmath16 , the rheology is controlled by the local scaling variable @xmath17 which is a generalization of eq.([eq : hstop ] ) . for steady state chute flow",
    ", these two quantities are related through @xmath18 whre @xmath19 is the volume fraction , thus they can be used interchangeably in this case .",
    "the fact that the same rheology can be advanced with or without an assumed fundamental length scale ( a `` correlation length '' ) raises questions about the correct interpretation of this length scale , and the nature of its relationship to flow - induced structures , if any .",
    "pouliquen  @xcite has recently reported experimental measurements of two point velocity correlation functions at the flow surface , and obtained results supporting a possible connection between the observed correlation length and the deposit function .    in this work ,",
    "we repeat and extend the correlation analysis presented by pouliquen  @xcite to layers that are far from the bottom and surface of the flow , where true bulk rheology is observed , by taking advantage of information available from discrete element ( dem ) simulations that is difficult to obtain experimentally .",
    "we are able to reproduce and further analyze the experimental results , and ultimately make the following observations :    * all two - point velocity correlation functions exhibit exponential decay with relative distance , generally with different values of the correlation length @xmath20 for different components @xmath21 of the velocity and @xmath22 of the displacement vector .",
    "* the measured correlation lengths @xmath20 vary with the velocity measurement time @xmath0 used to calculate the velocities from displacements . in order to be able to compare correlation lengths at different depths and between different runs",
    ", it is necessary to adjust the measurement time such that the particles that are being measured experience a fixed , predetermined strain @xmath23",
    ". this yields correlation lengths that are independent of the position of the measured layer in the bulk , or the overall flow height .",
    "* correlation lengths in the bulk are uniquely determined by the incline angle @xmath2 ( or equivalently by @xmath1 or @xmath24 ) .",
    "they increase with decreasing @xmath2 .",
    "* correlation lengths are typically quite small , of the order of a particle diameter , and increase approximately logarithmically with @xmath1 , contrary to the theoretical expectation of a proportional relationship between the two length scales . * for very high piles and angles close to the angle of repose , the flows excite a low frequency `` breathing mode '' with coherent motion normal to the surface layer , previously observed by silbert  @xcite .",
