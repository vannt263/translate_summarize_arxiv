    "bhabha scattering is an important process for extracting physics from experiments at electron - positron colliders primarily because it provides an effective means for determining luminosity .",
    "these measurements depend on having precise theoretical predictions for the bhabha scattering cross sections . as yet , the complete next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) qed corrections needed for reducing theoretical uncertainties have not been computed . in this paper",
    "we present the complete two - loop matrix elements that would enter into such a computation .",
    "this calculation also provides a means for validating techniques that can be applied to physically important but more intricate qcd calculations .",
    "it also provides an additional explicit verification of a general formula due to catani  @xcite for the structure of two - loop infrared divergences , and allows us to determine the process - dependent terms for the processes at hand .",
    "in bhabha scattering there are two distinct kinematic regions : small angle bhabha scattering ( sabs ) , and large angle ( labs ) . in the lep / slc energy range ,",
    "sabs is used to measure the machine luminosity via a dedicated small angle luminosity detector .",
    "sabs has a large cross section  about four times larger than @xmath6 decay in the @xmath7 window  making it particularly effective as a luminosity monitor . at the same time",
    ", sabs is calculable theoretically with high accuracy from known physics ( mainly qed ) , apart from hadronic vacuum polarization corrections that rely upon the experimental data for @xmath8 annihilation into hadrons at low energy  @xcite .",
    "therefore , sabs is an important ingredient in measuring any absolute cross section .",
    "for instance , the measurement of the hadronic cross section at the @xmath6 peak , @xmath9 , which enters several precision observables , is especially dependent on an accurate theoretical understanding of bhabha scattering .    at lep / slc , large angle bhabha scattering interferes with @xmath10 and",
    "so it is needed to disentangle important parameters such as the electroweak mixing angle .",
    "it is also useful for measuring the luminosity at flavor factories such as babar , belle , da@xmath11ne , vepp-2 m , and bepc / bes  @xcite .",
    "a peculiarity of future electron linear colliders is that the luminosity spectrum is not monochromatic because of the beam - beam effect . because of this , measuring the total small angle cross section of bhabha scattering alone is not sufficient , and therefore the angular distribution of labs was proposed for disentangling the luminosity spectrum  @xcite .    due to the experimental importance of this process",
    ", significant effort has been devoted to developing monte carlo event generators  see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview . in order to match the impressive experimental precision , a complete inclusion of nnlo qed quantum effects",
    "has become necessary . on the theoretical side , however , the calculation of two - loop four - point amplitudes has been a roadblock to further progress .    in this article",
    "we present the two - loop virtual qed corrections to the differential cross section for bhabha scattering , i.e. , the two - loop amplitude interfered with the tree amplitude and summed over all spins .",
    "we neglect the small electron mass in comparison to all other kinematic invariants , and use dimensional regularization to handle the ensuing infrared divergences . besides these contributions ,",
    "a number of other virtual and real emission contributions ( discussed in the conclusions ) still need to be obtained before a full monte carlo program for the bhabha scattering cross section can be constructed .",
    "the two - loop qed four - fermion amplitudes are also a useful testing ground for two - loop qcd calculations containing more than one kinematic invariant , which are required for higher - order jet cross sections and other aspects of collider physics . for processes that depend on a single momentum invariant , a number of important quantities have been calculated up to four loops , such as the total cross section for @xmath8 annihilation into hadrons and the qcd @xmath12-function  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the only complete two - loop four - point scattering amplitudes presently known for generic kinematics in massless gauge theory are the @xmath13 super - yang - mills amplitudes  @xcite , and @xmath14 in a single helicity configuration in pure gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "the two - loop amplitudes required for nnlo computations of jet production in hadron colliders , or for nnlo three - jet rates and other event shape variables at @xmath8 colliders , remain uncalculated .",
    "we note in passing that partial results for the leading - color part of two - loop contributions to quark - quark scattering have very recently appeared  @xcite .",
    "two important technical breakthroughs are the calculations of the dimensionally regularized scalar double box integrals with planar  @xcite and non - planar  @xcite topologies and all external legs massless , and the development of reduction algorithms for the same types of integrals with loop momenta in the numerator ( tensor integrals )  @xcite . related integrals , which also arise in the reduction procedure , have been computed in refs .",
    "@xcite . taken together",
    ", these results are sufficient to compute all loop integrals required for @xmath15 massless scattering amplitudes at two loops , thus removing a major obstacle to several types of nnlo calculations .",
    "in this paper we use these techniques to evaluate the integrals encountered in the bhabha calculation .",
    "an even more recent result concerning two - loop planar double box integrals with one massive external leg  @xcite holds promise for the nnlo computation of three - jet rates at @xmath8 colliders",
    ".    there has also been significant progress in developing general formalisms for other aspects of nnlo computations involving massless particles .",
    "the motivation has typically been infrared - safe observables in qcd , but many of the developments can be applied to the bhabha process as well .",
    "the developments include an understanding of the intricate structure of the infrared singularities that arise when more than one particle is unresolved ( i.e. , is soft or collinear with another particle )  @xcite . improved approximations to the nnlo correction to splitting functions",
    "have been constructed recently as well  @xcite .",
    "infrared divergences are a significant complication in all the qcd and qed computations mentioned above . in any suitably `` infrared - safe ''",
    "observable all final - state divergences will cancel  @xcite .",
    "however , divergences occur in individual amplitudes for fixed particle number , and it is very useful to have a general description of such divergences .",
    "catani has presented a general formula for the infrared divergence appearing in any two - loop qcd amplitude  @xcite . by appropriately adjusting group theory factors ,",
    "it is straightforward to convert catani s qcd formula to a qed formula , allowing us to directly verify it .",
    "moreover , we extract the exact form of a process - dependent term in the formula , for the case of qed scattering of four charged fermions . previously , the only process for which this term had been extracted  @xcite was the quark form factor which enters drell - yan production  @xcite .",
    "( it should also now be possible to extract it for @xmath16  higgs using the recent two - loop computation  @xcite . )",
    "interestingly , a simple generalization of the quark form factor term ( converted to qed ) correctly predicts the process - dependent term for the @xmath17 and bhabha amplitudes .",
    "we also use catani s formula to conveniently organize the infrared divergences and to absorb some of the finite terms .",
    "the previously computed non - abelian gauge theory amplitudes  @xcite were obtained via cutting methods .",
    "the low multiplicity and relative simplicity of the @xmath17 and bhabha scattering feynman diagrams makes it relatively easy to directly compute the diagrams , as we do here .",
    "we include here only the pure qed diagrams , neglecting for example the contributions of @xmath6 exchange , and hadronic vacuum polarization effects .",
    "the former are negligible at this order in sabs and in labs at flavor factories .",
    "the hadronic contributions are important , but much of their effect is straightforward to include by introducing a running coupling .",
    "we perform the calculation in dimensional regularization  @xcite with @xmath18 and set the small electron mass to zero , since it is the only form in which the required two - loop momentum integrals are known .",
    "moreover , it provides a powerful method for simultaneously dealing with both the infrared and ultraviolet divergences encountered in gauge theories .",
    "traditionally , dimensional regularization is not used for qed , in part because the infrared divergences are relatively tame compared to non - abelian gauge theories , so photon and electron masses are sufficient for cutting off the theory .",
    "another important reason for using dimensional regularization is to validate techniques that can also be applied to the more complicated case of qcd . in qcd ,",
    "dimensional regularization is the universally utilized method for dealing with divergences .    in the high - energy bhabha process ,",
    "even with an `` infrared - safe '' ( calorimetric ) final - state definition , the electron mass will still appear in large logarithms of the form @xmath19 due to initial - state radiation .",
    "however , in the dimensionally regulated amplitudes these singularities ( like all others ) appear as poles in @xmath20 .",
    "it may therefore be most convenient to handle the initial - state singularities using an electron structure function method  @xcite implemented in the @xmath21 collinear factorization scheme .",
    "in the next section we briefly describe our method for computing the two - loop amplitudes",
    ". then we describe catani s formula for the divergence structure of the amplitudes , followed by a presentation of the finite ( @xmath22 ) terms for both @xmath23 and bhabha scattering . in the final section",
    "we give our conclusions , including some discussion of the remaining ingredients still required for construction of a numerical program for bhabha scattering at this order .",
    "the 16 independent feynman diagram topologies describing the two - loop qed corrections to @xmath17 and bhabha scattering are enumerated in . in this figure",
    "we have suppressed the fermion arrows . after including the fermion arrows and distinct labels for the external legs ,",
    "there are a total of 47 feynman diagrams ; however , many of these diagrams generate identical results . of the 47 diagrams ,",
    "35 contain no fermion loop , 11 contain one fermion loop , and 1 contains two fermion loops",
    ". the bhabha amplitude may be obtained from the @xmath17 amplitude by adding to it the same set of diagrams , but with an exchange of one pair of external legs .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath25 amplitudes may , of course , be obtained by crossing .",
    "4.2 truein    -.2 cm    we have evaluated these diagrams interfered with the tree amplitudes and summed over spins in the conventional dimensional regularization ( cdr ) scheme .",
    "this interference gives directly the two - loop virtual correction to the @xmath26 differential cross section .",
    "the rules for implementing cdr are straightforward because all particle are treated uniformly in all parts of the calculation . in this scheme ,",
    "all momenta and all lorentz indices are taken to be @xmath27 dimensional vectors .",
    "( the @xmath28-matrices remain as @xmath29 matrices ; i.e. , @xmath30 = 4 $ ] . )    after performing all @xmath28-matrix algebra present in the two - loop feynman diagrams , we use the conservation of momenta flowing on the internal lines to express the tensor structure of the diagrams in terms of inverse scalar propagators and a small number of additional scalar invariants containing loop momenta .",
    "the inverse scalar propagators cancel propagators in the denominator to generate simpler `` boundary '' integrals . to handle the integrals containing scalar invariants",
    ", we introduce feynman parameters and interpret the resulting integrals in terms of scalar integrals with multiple propagators , which are then reduced to a set of master integrals with the help of equations in refs .",
    "@xcite .    proceeding in this way",
    ", we obtain an expression for the amplitude in terms of master integrals ( of the type listed in ref .",
    "@xcite , plus a few more for the planar double box topology ) multiplied by coefficient functions .",
    "this expression is in principle valid to an arbitrary order in @xmath20 , assuming that the master integrals could be evaluated to such an order .",
    "however , it is a bit too lengthy to present here , and for nnlo computations only the series expansion in @xmath20 through @xmath22 is required . to carry out this expansion",
    ", we use expansions of the master integrals presented in refs .  @xcite . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is a slight problem with the original choice of basis  @xcite for the two master planar double box integrals .",
    "in that basis , the coefficients for generic tensor integrals contain @xmath31 poles , necessitating an @xmath32 evaluation of the master integrals .",
    "several solutions to this problem have been presented  @xcite .",
    "we have used a slightly different solution , which is simply to use the original pair of master integrals defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , except evaluated in @xmath33 instead of @xmath18 . in @xmath33",
    "the integrals have neither ultraviolet nor infrared divergences , making them simpler to evaluate through @xmath22 than the @xmath18 integrals .",
    "many of the master integral expansions quoted in refs .",
    "@xcite are in terms of nielsen functions  @xcite , @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "we have found it useful to express the results instead in terms of a minimal set of polylogarithms  @xcite , @xmath36 with @xmath37 , using relations such as @xmath38 here @xmath39    the analytic properties of the non - planar double box integrals are somewhat intricate  @xcite , since they are not real in any of the three kinematic channels for the @xmath26 process , @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "therefore we shall present explicit formulae for the finite terms in the amplitude in both the @xmath44- and @xmath45-channels ; those in the @xmath46-channel will be related by symmetries .",
    "dimensionally regulated two - loop amplitudes for four massless fermions contain poles in @xmath47 up to @xmath48 .",
    "the structure of most of these singularities has already been exposed by catani  @xcite , who described the infrared behavior of general two - loop qcd processes .",
    "we shall therefore adopt his notation in presenting our results .",

    "nevertheless , it should be relatively straightforward to obtain , given that it involves only one - loop amplitudes with four - point kinematics .",
    "the required integrals are given to sufficiently high order in @xmath20 in .",
    "the qed one - loop five - point amplitude interfered with the five - point tree is a rather involved object to compute from scratch .",
    "however , the closely related one - loop helicity amplitudes for one photon and two quark pairs are known  @xcite , and it is a relatively simple matter to modify the color factors to obtain the corresponding qed amplitudes .",

    "because of the @xmath181 infrared divergences that are encountered in the phase - space integral , in regions where the photon is soft or collinear , one might seem to require the one - loop five - point amplitude through @xmath117 . however , this is not necessary  @xcite .",
    "instead , one can replace the five - point amplitudes in singular phase - space regions by a combination of four - point amplitudes ( which are given in this paper to the required order in the dimensional regularization parameter ) and splitting amplitudes  @xcite .",

    "@xcite for the case of qcd .",
    "once again the results for qed can be obtained by a conversion of the color factors .",
    "even with all of these matrix element ingredients assembled , it is a nontrivial task to devise a numerically stable method for carrying out the singular phase - space integrations .",
    "nevertheless , this task is very analogous to that required to obtain qcd jet predictions at next - to - next - to - leading order , so it is likely that it will be attacked soon .    besides the obvious application of the present paper to refined theoretical predictions for bhabha scattering and for electron - positron annihilation into muons , it also serves as a further test of methods that can be applied to analogous qcd processes .",
