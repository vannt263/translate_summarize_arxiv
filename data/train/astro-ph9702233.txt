    "finding distant galaxies and analyzing their starlight remains one of the only direct methods of studying the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "in particular , the reddest normal galaxies at high redshifts provide the best constraints on the earliest epochs of galaxy formation and evolution , since their color is most likely due to an aged stellar population .",
    "several photometric and spectroscopic studies of galaxy evolution out to redshifts @xmath16 have discovered that the red galaxy population ( which predominantly consists of early type e / s0 galaxies ) evolves `` passively '' with time , , by the gradual reddening and fading of the integrated starlight ( , driver 1995ab ; lilly 1995 ; rakos & schombert 1995 ; schade 1995 ; stanford 1995 , 1997a ; oke 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , the discovery of @xmath17 cluster galaxies with morphologies and rest frame colors similar to those of nearby ellipticals ( , couch 1994 ; dressler 1995 ; dickinson 1996 ; dickinson 1997 ) suggests a high formation redshift ( @xmath18 ) for the red population and emphasizes the importance of studying these objects at even larger lookback times .",
    "the high - redshift red galaxy population is faint at observed optical ( rest  frame ultraviolet ) wavelengths , and therefore most studies of galaxies at high redshift have concentrated on the luminous , blue , emission line objects ( star  forming and active galaxies ) which are easier to find and relatively easy to study spectroscopically at optical wavelengths ( , cowie 1995 , steidel 1996 ) .",
    "one of the prerequisites to studying old populations at high redshifts is therefore to find distant luminous early type galaxies .",
    "the association of nearby , bright radio sources with low redshift giant elliptical and cd galaxies suggests that a good method of finding such old populations at high redshifts is to search for the optical counterparts of faint radio sources ( kron 1985 ) .",
    "this has been the primary driving force behind several radio source identification and redshift determination programs over the last three decades , and has resulted in several nearly completely identified radio source catalogues ( , 3cr  spinrad & djorgovski 1987 ; molonglo  mccarthy 1996 ; 1jy  lilly 1989 ; parkes  dunlop 1989a ; 2jy  tadhunter 1993 ; mg  stern 1997 ) .",
    "unfortunately , most of these studies , although resulting in a large number of high - redshift objects , are of limited use for studying the evolution of normal galaxies .",
    "this is primarily because the ultraviolet ( uv ) light in most luminous radio galaxies is dominated by scattered light from and photoionization by the active nucleus rather than starlight ( , mccarthy 1987 ; chambers 1987 ; di serego alighieri 1989 ; di serego alighieri 1994 ; jannuzi & elston 1991 ; jannuzi 1995 ; dey & spinrad 1996 ; dey 1996 ; cimatti 1996 ) . nevertheless , there have been several attempts to age - date the underlying stellar population using broad band optical and near  infrared photometry ( , dunlop 1989b ; chambers & charlot 1990 ; mccarthy 1993 ) and a few valiant efforts using moderate signal  to  noise ratio spectroscopy ( , stockton , kellogg & ridgway 1995 ; chambers & mccarthy 1990 ) .",
    "these attempts have been limited by the inherent ambiguities of modelling broad band colors and , in the spectroscopic studies , the problems of subtracting the strong emission lines and uv non - stellar continuum light and correctly decomposing the agn and stellar components .",
    "although radio galaxies have been , thus far , of limited cosmological utility , they are not to be discarded as useful probes of the early epochs of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "first , they are still the highest redshift galaxy - like objects ( , spatially extended and possibly composed of stars ) known ( , lacy 1995 ; spinrad , dey & graham 1995 ; rawlings 1996 ) .",
    "second , there appears to be a good correlation between radio power and the fractional contribution of non - stellar agn light to the uv spectrum ; in particular , weak radio sources ( @xmath19 mjy ) generally have very weak emission lines and , unlike the powerful radio galaxies , do not exhibit uv / radio alignments , suggesting that the contribution of scattered agn emission to their continuum light is small ( , rawlings & saunders 1991 ; dunlop & peacock 1993 ; eales & rawlings 1993 ; vigotti 1996 ) .",
    "hence , _ weak _ radio sources with red optical / ir colors may _ still _ provide us with the ability of studying uncontaminated starlight in nearly normal , luminous elliptical galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the radio source selection above a few mjy almost guarantees an early type host galaxy ( , dunlop , peacock & windhorst 1995 and references therein ) and the near  ir magnitude and color criteria ensure that the galaxy will be at high redshift . for reference ,",
    "a present - day @xmath20 elliptical galaxy observed at a redshift @xmath21 , has a typical magnitude of @xmath22 and color @xmath23 .    in order to further test this hypothesis ,",
    "we have chosen as targets for deep optical spectroscopy a subset of weak radio sources ( 1  mjy @xmath24  mjy ) from the leiden - berkeley deep survey ( hereinafter lbds ; windhorst 1984ab ) which are associated with host galaxies that have faint near  ir magnitudes ( @xmath25 ) and red optical - ir colors ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "photometry is now available for a statistically complete sample of 77 galaxies having @xmath27 photometry to @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( dunlop , peacock , & windhorst 1995 ) . in this paper",
    ", we present our results on lbds  53w091 , a weak radio source ( @xmath30  mjy ) which is among the reddest faint lbds galaxies , suggesting a substantial distance and an aged population .",
    "early results on this galaxy have already been reported by us elsewhere ( dunlop 1996 ) , and the present work includes a more detailed description of our data , spectral analyses , and age - dating techniques . in ",
    "2 we present our optical , ir and radio imaging photometry and optical spectroscopy .",
    "the redshift determination is described in   3 .",
    "the derived age estimates based on spectral synthesis model fitting and the differences between the various models are presented in  4 . in   5 we discuss the cosmological implications of finding such an old galaxy at high redshift .",
    "the optical counterpart of the radio source lbds  53w091 was first identified on images of the field obtained using the palomar 200 \" hale telescope .",
    "the four - shooter ccd - array on the hale telescope was used in 1984  1988 to systematically image those mjy radio sources in the 17@xmath31 + 50@xmath32 lbds field ( windhorst , van heerde , & katgert 1984 ; whk ) that were fainter than @xmath33 mag ( , sources not detected on the deep @xmath34 plates obtained with the kpno 4-m mayall telescope ; windhorst , kron , & koo 1984 ; wkk ) .",
    "the four - shooter imaging was done in gunn @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "each frame consists of four simultaneously exposed 800@xmath37800 ti ccds , and covers @xmath38 .",
    "details of the four - shooter imaging , calibration , and reduction are given by neuschaefer & windhorst ( 1995a , b ; nw95a , nw95b ) .",
    "this includes a careful removal of large scale gradients to within 0.1% of sky , so that aperture magnitudes could be reliably grown to total ( see windhorst et al 1991 ) .",
    "photometric calibration was done measuring standard stars from thuan & gunn ( 1976 ) and kent ( 1985 ) , and correcting for atmospheric extinction as a function of airmass and ( @xmath39 ) color . from overlapping four - shooter regions and multiple exposures during different",
    "observing runs , we could check the internal consistency of the photometry during these runs , which was usually @xmath40 mag ( nw95a ) .",
    "astrometry was done with typically 30 primary standard stars from recent palomar 48 inch schmidt plates , and 68 standard stars in each four - shooter ccd , as described by wkk and nw95a . with",
    "repeated astrometric measurements under different plate orientations , a global astrometric accuracy could be obtained of @xmath41 .",
    "the westerbork radio positions of whk and the vla positions of oort ( 1987 ) ( with typical accuracies of @xmath42 ) were sufficient to find a reliable optical identification for each source .",
    "high resolution radio images of lbds  53w091 at frequencies of 1.56  ghz and 4.86  ghz were obtained using the vla a - array in snapshot mode on 1995 october 29 .",
    "figure  [ vla ] shows the 4.86  ghz map of the radio source , and the radio data are presented in table  [ radiodata ] . the source is a double  lobed frii steep ",

    "its optical fluxes result in magnitudes in gunn @xmath53 ( 2@xmath54 ) and @xmath55 mag ( see nw95a , b for details ) .",
    "its 1.41 ghz radio flux density is 22.4@xmath510.9 mjy from wsrt observations ( with a beamsize of 12  fwhm ) in 19801984 ( windhorst et al .",
    "1984 , oort & van langevelde 1987 ) .",
    "its 0.61  ghz wsrt flux density is 66.0@xmath513.9 mjy , implying a 0.611.41  ghz spectral index of 1.30@xmath510.13 .",
    "the source is resolved at the 1.4  fwhm vla a - array resolution , and has las=@xmath56 ( oort et al .",
    "the 1.490  ghz vla a  array flux density measured in 1985 , transformed back to 1.41  ghz with the measured spectral index , was @xmath57=28.8@xmath511.5  mjy .",
    "the 1995 vla a  array flux density , transformed to 1.41 ghz with the spectral index calculated from those observations , was @xmath57=25.9@xmath511.9  mjy .",
    "the vla a ",
    "array observations were done at @xmath58 higher resolution than the wsrt observations , and therefore may systematically miss flux .",
    "it is therefore curious that the 1985 vla 1.41 ghz flux density is slightly higher ( at the combined 3.7@xmath54 level ) than the 1980 - 1984 wsrt 1.41 ghz flux density , so that the possibility of _ weak _ nuclear variability can not be ruled out . however , given its weak radio flux , steep  spectrum , and small but resolved angular size , the radio properties point at best to a relatively weak agn .",
    "we note that the occurrence of a faint _ red _ identification for a compact weak radio source is quite common in the lbds sample ( kron 1985 , windhorst 1985 ) , but less common in a @xmath59jy sample ( windhorst et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "we obtained an @xmath60-band image of the field of lbds  53w091 using the low - resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke 1995 ) on the w.  m.  keck telescope on ut 1995 july 25 . the lris detector is a tektronix @xmath61 ccd with 24  @xmath59 m pixels corresponding to a scale of 0214 pixel@xmath8 .",

    "near - infrared images of lbds  53w091 were obtained using the 3.9-m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) . on ut 1993 may 16 we obtained a 54-minute @xmath64-band image using the 62 @xmath37 58 pixel insb array camera ircam1 , with the camera operating in the 0.62 arcsec pixel@xmath8 mode .",
    "deep @xmath65-band ( 54 minutes ) and @xmath66-band ( 81 minutes ) images of lbds  53w091 were subsequently obtained on ut 1995 august 19 using the 256 @xmath37 256 pixel insb array camera ircam3 , with an image scale of 0.286 arcsec pixel@xmath8 .",
    "the infrared images were constructed from a mosaic of short - exposure ( @xmath67 3 minutes ) frames which were shifted with respect to each other by between 8 and 15 arcsec .",
    "this procedure meant that the target source fell on a different set of pixels in each frame , and so the frames could be median filtered to provide an accurate sky flat - field for the image concerned .",
    "the reduction procedure was as follows : ( i ) subtraction of a dark / bias frame from each sub - image ; ( ii ) removal of known bad pixels ; ( iii ) scaling of each image to the same median level , followed by median filtering of the stack ; ( iv ) normalization of the resulting flat field ; ( v ) division of each sub - image by the flat - field ; ( vi ) construction of the final mosaic involving accurate registration , subtraction of frame - to - frame dc variations , and averaging of regions of overlap .",

    "we used a 300  line / mm grating ( @xmath75 ) to cover the wavelength region @xmath76  and a 1  slit which resulted in a resolution @xmath77 the data from ut 1995 july 25 , august 31 and september 1 were of the best quality : the galaxy was detected in all these individual spectra and the seeing varied between 08 and 10 during the observations .",
    "these observations were all made with the slit oriented at position angle @xmath78 in order to obtain spectra of the two brightest red objects in the field , lbds  53w091 and galaxy 3a ( , dunlop 1996 ) . on these nights ,",
    "the parallactic angle varied between @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and our relative spectrophotometry should not be adversely affected by atmospheric refraction .",
    "the data were bias - corrected , and flat - fielded using internal quartz flats obtained immediately after each observation .",
    "these observations of lbds  53w091 , galaxy 3@xmath81 and 3@xmath82 ( see figure  [ images ] for nomenclature ) were extracted using apertures of 17 ( 8 pixels ) .",
    "the individual spectra were wavelength calibrated using hgkr and nea lamps obtained after each observation .",
    "flux calibration was performed using , on different nights , observations of the standard stars feige 110 , bd+33@xmath482642 , g191b2b and wolf  1346 .",
    "standard star spectra were obtained both with and without a gg495 order - blocking filter in order to correct for the second order light at long wavelengths .",
    "the flux calibrated spectra of lbds  53w091 from different nights are consistent with each other : the average flux in the wavelength region from 6500  to 8500  showed night - to - night variations of less than 15% .",
    "finally , the individual spectra of lbds  53w091 were corrected for the effects of telluric o@xmath83 absorption using an absorption template determined from the observations of the standard stars and scaled to the appropriate airmass .",
    "the corrected spectra were then coadded to produce the final spectrum shown in figure  [ spectrum ] .",
    "the resultant spectrogram has an effective exposure time of 5.5 hours .",
    "the two red galaxies ( lbds  53w091 and 3a ) have similar spectra and similar @xmath84 colors , although the data for lbds  53w091 are of higher signal  to  noise ratio . in figure  [ galaxy3a ]",
    "we present binned spectra of galaxy 3a and lbds  53w091 to illustrate their similarities ; note , in particular , the continuum discontinuity at 7400 .",
    "the spectra of the two blue galaxies ( `` 1 '' and `` 3b '' ) are shown in figure  [ galaxy1 ] .",
    "galaxy 1 , which lies 55 nw of lbds  53w091 , shows moderately strong [ ] @xmath853727 emission and absorption at @xmath86 ( the absorption is affected by telluric na  d emission ) .",
    "the fainter galaxy 3b has two weak emission lines at 5185  and 6964  which we identify as [ ] @xmath853727 and [ ] @xmath855007 at @xmath87 .",
    "table [ spectroscopy ] lists their emission line identifications , fluxes and redshifts .",
    "the spectrum shown of galaxy 1 represents 1  hour of integration on ut 95 may 27 ; galaxy 3b was observed along the same long slit as lbds  53w091 and thus represents 5.5 hours of total integration .",
    "as mentioned above , the bluer galaxies ( 1 and 3b ) have emission line spectra and are moderately low redshift galaxies similar to those found in deep field surveys ( , lilly 1995 ; cowie 1995 ) .",
    "it is the interpretation of the two _ red _ galaxies with absorption line spectra ( lbds  53w091 and 3a ) that are the crux of this paper , and therefore the remainder of this section describes the determination of their redshifts .",
    "the key to understanding the spectrum of lbds  53w091 is the unique `` tophat''-shaped region that is observed near @xmath88   ( see figure  [ spectrum ] ) .",
    "inspection of the ultraviolet spectra of f and g dwarfs obtained with the _ copernicus _ and _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) satellites clearly show a similarly shaped feature commencing at rest wavelength @xmath89 2640   ( , morton 1977 ; wu 1991 ; figure  [ iuestar ] ) .",
    "this tophat feature is caused by metal line  blanketing on either side : in solar type stars , the short wavelength edge is defined largely by absorption lines , and the continuum depression on the long wavelength side is dominated by the several weak metal lines and two strong absorption features of @xmath90  and @xmath91  ( in individual spectra of g2v stars the equivalent width of the doublet is more than 25 ; morton 1977 , fanelli 1992 ) .",
    "we note that the observed dip in the spectrum of lbds  53w091 at @xmath92  coincides with a blended ( and therefore broad ) telluric oh feature .",
    "the errors in the spectrum in this wavelength region are large and the galaxy faint , and we do not place much weight on this particular narrow absorption feature . however , if this feature is indeed real , it is likely due to @xmath93 absorption arising in a foreground system at @xmath94 rather than a spectral feature associated with lbds  53w091 .",
    "the overall shape of the observed continuum spectrum and the good match of the continuum breaks at @xmath95  and @xmath96  with the known 2640  and 2900  spectral breaks , and the identification of the absorption feature at @xmath97  with the @xmath852800  doublet together suggest that the redshift of lbds  53w091 is @xmath98 .",
    "cross correlation of the lbds  53w091 spectrum in the rest wavelength range @xmath99  with the spectrum of an f6v star from the wu ( 1991 ) _ iue _ spectral atlas results in a more accurate redshift of @xmath100 .",
    "the spectrum of lbds  53w091 is also very similar to the spectra of two nearby elliptical galaxies , m32 and ngc  3610 ( figure  [ m32 ] ) ; this comparison adds further confidence to our redshift determination .",
    "finally , we have discovered several other galaxies with similar rest - frame spectra ( dey 1997 , dickinson 1997 , stanford 1997b ) .",
    "all of these galaxies are at slightly lower redshifts ; in several [ ] @xmath853727 emission and the h&k absorption lines are also detected , reinforcing the redshift determination from the 2640  and 2900  breaks . with the exception of one object",
    ", these other galaxies are not known to be radio sources , supporting the conclusion that these spectral features are due to starlight .",
    "the spectrum of the fainter red galaxy 3a ( figure  [ galaxy3a ] ) is noisy at short wavelengths ; nevertheless we can use the broad  band colors and the observed continuum discontinuity at 7400  ( which is very similar to the rest ",
    "frame 2900  feature observed in lbds  53w091 ) to derive an estimate of its redshift .",
    "the similarity in all the measured broad  band colors ( table  [ photometry ] ) and the detection of the 2900  break suggest similar redshifts for the two galaxies , and we therefore tentatively estimate @xmath101 for galaxy 3a .",
    "we note that galaxy 4 also has similar colors to lbds  53w091 ( although the errors are larger ) , and may therefore also be at a similar redshift .",
    "lbds  53w091 is a double  lobed frii radio source and has a radio power at rest ",
    "frame 1.41  ghz of @xmath102 .",
    "hence , although the radio power of lbds  53w091 is at least 50 times less than that of the 3cr radio galaxies at similar redshifts , it is nevertheless a fairly powerful , steep  spectrum radio source that lies above the break in the radio galaxy luminosity function ( , fanaroff & riley 1974 ) . in this subsection",
    "we discuss lbds  53w091 in the context of two properties of powerful radio galaxies : the alignment effect and the uniformity of the @xmath64 hubble diagram .",
    "both of these properties are relevant to our later discussion on the stellar content and age of lbds  53w091 .",
    "the intriguing aspect of the spectrum of lbds  53w091 is that it appears to be so similar to that of nearby normal early  type galaxies .",
    "most high - redshift powerful radio galaxies have rest - frame uv spectra that are dominated by strong line emission and non - stellar continuum emission .",
    "the spectrum of lbds  53w091 shows no detectable emission lines .",
    "[ ] @xmath853727 , usually the strongest feature in the optical window for galaxies in the redshift range @xmath103 , is redshifted to the very edge of our observed spectral range which is strongly contaminated by telluric oh emission . as a result , no useful limit can be placed on the [ ] line flux .",
    "we searched for possible weak uv emission lines of ] @xmath852326 and ] @xmath851909 ; none were found ( @xmath104 limits are @xmath105},f_{\\rm ciii ] } \\simlt 3.2 \\times 10^{-18}\\ { \\rm erg\\ s^{-1}\\ cm^{-2}}$ ] in the observed frame ) although they would be anticipated if an active nucleus contributed an appreciable flux of ionizing photons at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the lack of strong emission lines in the spectrum of lbds  53w091 may very well be related to its lower radio luminosity .",
    "for example , deep spectroscopy of @xmath17 powerful radio sources ( , stockton 1996 , dey & spinrad 1996 ) has demonstrated the presence of an underlying red stellar population that is veiled by the strong agn - related uv emission in the rest - frame uv and only begins to dominate the spectrum at red rest - frame optical wavelengths . in radio galaxies containing lower luminosity agn",
    ", it is therefore quite reasonable to expect that the diluting agn continuum is lower , and that the starlight is more easily visible , and may even dominate the rest - frame uv spectrum .",
    "the more powerful 3cr radio galaxies at similar redshifts ( @xmath106 ) also show very complex , elongated rest - frame uv morphologies that tend to be aligned with their radio axes , an indication that their morphologies are strongly influenced by the presence of the active nucleus ( mccarthy 1987 , chambers 1987 ) .",
    "the discovery that the extended uv continuum structures in many @xmath107 powerful radio galaxies are polarized has led to the suggestion that the aligned morphologies are caused by anisotropic radiation scattering off dust and electrons in the ambient medium into our line of sight ( , di serego alighieri 1989 ) . however , it has also been suggested that the aligned uv emission is starlight from a young stellar population formed by the expansion of the radio source into the dense ambient medium ( de young 1981 , 1989 , begelman & cioffi 1989 ) .",
    "whichever process is responsible , the relevant issue is whether or not one can consider the optical light from radio galaxies as being unaffected by the presence of the active nucleus , and therefore whether any conclusions regarding the evolution of radio galaxies may be generally extrapolated to the ( luminous ) early  type galaxy population as a whole .",
    "if we consider galaxy 3a to be part of the lbds  53w091 system , then it might be argued that lbds  53w091 exhibits the alignment effect ; i.e. , the position angle of the axis connecting the host galaxy of the radio source to the companion galaxy 3a ( @xmath108 ) is roughly similar to that of the radio axis ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "since the uv spectra of both galaxies appear to be dominated by starlight , it is conceivable that the alignment in this system is the result of radio source triggered star formation .",
    "however , this seems unlikely given that both galaxies appear to be dominated by _ old _",
    ", red populations , whereas the radio source is fairly compact ( @xmath110 kpc ) and therefore likely young [ @xmath111 yr ] .",
    "it is therefore more probable that the observed alignment is a chance coincidence .",
    "we also note that some alignments may result from anisotropic infall along large ",
    "scale filaments and the possible alignments observed between these filaments and radio jet axes ( e.g. , west 1991 ) .    furthermore , the rest ",
    "frame uv spectrum argues against any significant scattered component : the flux is roughly zero at @xmath112  and 2500 , and suggests that any significant scattered agn component would have to be at least as red as the overall galaxy spectrum .",
    "if a reddened agn spectrum is indeed present and dust  scattered as is the case in most of the luminous @xmath113 radio galaxies , we may expect to see a wavelength ",
    "dependent image structure : there is no evidence for this in lbds  53w091 .",
    "finally , as discussed below , the 2640  and 2900  breaks are stellar absorption features and their amplitudes are reddening independent ; the contribution of a highly reddened agn component does not affect the inferences derived from these breaks regarding the age of the underlying stellar population .",

    "lbds  53w091 is therefore a galaxy whose local luminosity approximates that of an @xmath20 galaxy . using the sed of a 3.5  gyr old population ( from the jimenez synthesis models ; see   4.3 ) to calculate the @xmath64-correction , we find rest - frame luminosities of @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( for = 50 , @xmath120 ) .",

    "the similarity of the spectrum of lbds  53w091 to the spectra of f and g stars ( figure  [ iuestar ] ) and , in particular , to the spectra of nearby old elliptical galaxies ( figure  [ m32 ] ) , suggests that this galaxy may serve as a high - redshift benchmark in the study of the evolution of early type galaxies . at a redshift of 1.55 , an = 75 , @xmath126 ,",

    "we employ various methods to estimate the time elapsed since the last major epoch of star formation in lbds  53w091 . for the sake of conciseness",
    ", we refer to this time as the ` age ' of the stellar population .",
    "it is important to note that this age refers to the most recent star formation episode which currently dominates the uv spectrum , and _ not _ the first epoch of star formation in the galaxy .",
    "determination of the age of the uv population therefore provides a _ lower limit _ to the age of the galaxy ; the latter should include an additional time period for the dynamical assembly of the galaxy and the first epoch(s ) of star formation ( necessary to create the observed metals and mix them into the star forming material ) .",
    "it is well known that the various extant evolutionary spectral synthesis models result in different ages when fit to the same optical spectra .",
    "these differences between the models are largely due to the differing treatments of stars in their post ",
    "main  sequence stages ( charlot , worthey , & bressan 1996 ) as well as differing treatments of ( main  sequence ) stellar spectra in the uv .",
    "we therefore begin our analysis of the uv spectrum by deriving simple estimates of the age which are based solely on a determination of the color of the main  sequence turnoff population (   4.1 and 4.3 ) and comparisons to the uv spectra of nearby elliptical galaxies (   4.2 ) .",
    "age estimates based on the evolutionary synthesis models are presented in   4.4 .",
    "we also investigate the robustness of these age estimates by applying the same models to the uv spectrum of m32 . since the present spectrum of lbds  53w091 is of insufficient signal - to - noise ratio for a detailed comparison with the spectral synthesis models , the uv color index @xmath128 and the break amplitudes @xmath129 and @xmath130 defined below provides a better alternative than spectral fitting for estimating the age of the stellar population .",
    "the rest frame uv emission from a simple stellar population which is older than approximately 1  gyr is dominated by starlight from the main  sequence turnoff population ( , charlot & bruzual 1991 ; s.  charlot , personal communication ) .",

    "hence , the determination of the effective spectral type of the integrated uv light from the galaxy provides a fairly straightforward measure of the mean effective temperature of the turnoff population , and therefore an estimate of the time since the last epoch of star formation in the galaxy . in an attempt to derive a purely empirical age estimate for lbds  53w091 in this section ,",
    "we ignore for the present the small contributions to the uv light from evolved stars and stars below the main  sequence turnoff .    in order to evaluate the age of the stellar population of lbds  53w091",

    "the mean spectrum of type f6v provided the best fit to the spectrum of lbds  53w091 and was able to reproduce the overall shape of the spectrum fairly accurately ( figure  [ iuestar ] ) .",
    "this implies a color of @xmath133 for the main  sequence turnoff population .    in order to obtain an independent estimate of the best - matching spectral type which depends",
    "more on the details of the absorption spectrum than on the overall shape , we define two spectral breaks , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , at the 2640  and 2900  continuum discontinuities @xmath134 @xmath135 and a longer wavelength baseline uv color index @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the average flux density ( in @xmath138 ) in the wavelength interval [ @xmath139 .",
    "note that our definition of the break amplitudes differs slightly from that utilized in dunlop ( 1996 ) .    since the @xmath129 and @xmath130 breaks are defined over a narrow spectral range ( as indicated in figure  [ m32 ] ) , they are largely independent of reddening , and are determined primarily by the opacities of the metal absorption lines responsible for the absorption on their violet sides .",
    "table [ breaks ] presents the measured break amplitudes for lbds  53w091 and compares them with those determined from the mean f and g star spectra ( see also figures  [ b2640star ] and [ b2900star ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that the _ iue _ spectra have reseaux marks that contaminate the spectral regions @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( wu 1991 ) .",
    "these contaminate the flux at the blue edge of the tophat feature and the @xmath852852 absorption line .",
    "since the tophat is roughly flat in this region , the @xmath129 break determination remains unaffected .",
    "in addition , our definition of @xmath130 starts just longward of the second affected region , and therefore this break is also fairly well determined .    figures  [ b2640star ] and [ b2900star ] show the variation of the @xmath129 and @xmath130 break amplitudes with color for main sequence stars in the _ iue _ spectral atlas of wu ( 1991 ) .",
    "the @xmath129 break amplitude shows a significant scatter in the spectra of stars with spectral types later than f5v , and therefore can only provide a lower limit to the turnoff color of the uv population in lbds  53w091 of @xmath142 ( , spectral types later than f5v ) .",
    "the @xmath130 break amplitude shows smaller scatter with spectral type or @xmath143 color , and therefore provides a more robust estimate on the color of the turnoff population of @xmath144 ( , spectral types f9v  g8v ) .",
    "we determined stellar age estimates as a function of metallicity and turnoff color using the revised yale isochrones ( green , demarque and king 1987 ) .",
    "the results of this analysis are tabulated in table [ ryiages ] . for solar metallicities ( @xmath145 ) the bluest turnoff color ( @xmath146 )",
    "implies a minimum age around 2.5  gyr .",
    "if the true turnoff color is @xmath147 ( as suggested by @xmath130 ) , then the corresponding turnoff age for a solar abundance population is @xmath148  gyr .",
    "the uv color index @xmath128 also results in a consistent estimate of the turnoff color .",
    "figure  [ iueruv ] shows the variation of the uv color index with @xmath143 color for the stars in the _ iue _ spectral atlas .",
    "the uv color for lbds  53w091 corresponds to a turnoff @xmath143 color between 0.45 and 0.55 ( typical of f5v ",
    "f9v stars ) and implies a minimum age of @xmath149  gyr for solar metallicity populations .",
    "note that the @xmath143 color ( and therefore age ) remains roughly constant for values of the uv color index @xmath150 ( corresponding to ages @xmath151  gyr ) .",
    "this index , along with the spectral breaks , provides a firm lower limit to the age of the composite population .",
    "the breaks and the overall spectrum , considered together , imply a turnoff color of @xmath152 ( spectral type later than f6v ) , with a best fit to the break amplitudes for @xmath153 ( spectral type g0v ) .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath128 is more vulnerable than the spectral breaks to reddening by dust .",
    "the consistent estimates of the turnoff color determined from @xmath128 and the break amplitudes therefore reinforce our assumption that reddening due to dust is minimal .",
    "the @xmath129 and @xmath130 breaks we define above are similar to the 2609/2660 and 2828/2921 spectral breaks defined by fanelli ( 1992 ) . studying the _ iue _ spectra of a small sample of metal rich and metal poor stars , fanelli found that the strengths of these breaks are relatively insensitive to metallicity . for lbds  53w091 , we estimate these breaks ( using the fanelli definition ) to be @xmath154 mag and @xmath155 mag respectively .",
    "these values are typical of stars with @xmath156 ( of spectral type f6v - g0v ) , and imply turnoff ages of @xmath149  gyr for populations with @xmath157 .      as an additional empirical method to estimate the age of lbds  53w091 ,",
    "it is instructive to directly compare the spectrum of lbds  53w091 to the uv spectra of well  studied nearby galaxies in an attempt to determine an age _ relative _ to the local evolved galaxy population .",
    "the youngest stars in a galaxy will be the bluest , and therefore any young or intermediate  age population present will dominate the galaxy s uv spectrum . in figure  [ m32 ]",
    "we plot the normalized rest  frame uv spectral energy distribution of lbds  53w091 along with the _ iue _ spectrum of m32 ( burstein 1988 ) and the _ hst _ spectrum of ngc  3610 ( ferguson , private communication ) .",
    "m32 is a nearby low luminosity galaxy which is believed to contain an intermediate  age stellar population ( @xmath158  gyr old ) in addition to the very old ( @xmath159  gyr ) stars usually present in elliptical galaxies ( , baum 1959 , oconnell 1980 , burstein 1984 , rocca  volmerange & guiderdoni 1987 ) .",
    "early studies of resolved stars in m32 ( freedman 1992 , elston & silva 1992 ) and more recent studies of the integrated optical and ultraviolet spectrum ( bressan 1994 , worthey 1994 ) are in good agreement with this conclusion , and imply that the most recent episode of star formation in m32 occured 4  5 gyr ago .",
    "in contrast , a recent deeper imaging study with _ hst _ by grillmair ( 1996 ) finds that the red giant branch in m32 shows a substantial spread in color , implying that the galaxy also exhibits a substantial range in metallicity which will affect the interpretation of the uv light ( , the age of the younger population ) .",
    "nevertheless , the youngest populations in m32 appear to have an age of @xmath160  gyr .",
    "ngc  3610 is another well  studied nearby elliptical galaxy which shows evidence for the presence of an intermediate  age stellar population .",
    "ngc  3610 has an interesting morphology with twisted isophotes and a kinematically distinct core ( scorza & bender 1990 , rix & white 1992 ) , and shows evidence for a central stellar ring ( silva and bothun 1997 ) .",
    "the galaxy colors are bluer and the nucleus shows stronger h@xmath161 absorption than similar m@xmath162 ellipticals , though the absorption is less than what is observed for e+a galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath163 color increases at the nucleus , a behavior opposite to what one expects from dust extinction , implying an extended agb population because agb stars are redder than rgb stars . taken together",
    ", this evidence convincingly supports the existence of an intermediate  age population in ngc  3610 ( silva & bothun 1997 ) similar to the more extensively studied case of m32 .",
    "a comparison of the break amplitudes and the @xmath128 color index in ngc  3610 and m32 with those of late f and early g stars ( table 4 ) strongly supports the hypothesis that an intermediate  age population dominates the near  uv spectra in these galaxies .    in order to compare the overall shape of the spectra",
    ", we also defined broad spectral bins ( in the ranges @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 ) and determined crude color indices .",
    "we note that although m32 and ngc  3610 have composite stellar populations , the uv light in these galaxies is very likely to be dominated by the youngest turnoff population ; the uv spectra of these galaxies therefore mimic that of a single burst populations , and the comparison to lbds  53w091 is therefore justified .",
    "the spectrum of lbds  53w091 is bluer than the spectra of both m32 and ngc  3610 , suggesting that the last epoch of star formation in lbds  53w091 may be slightly younger than that in these nearby galaxies , or alternatively that lbds  53w091 has an additional source of uv continuum emission ( cf .  ",
    "4.9 ) . although the uv continuum of lbds  53w091 is bluer that that of m32 and ngc  3610 , it is important to note that within the formal errors the amplitudes of the 2640  and 2900  breaks are roughly similar to these systems .",
    "we therefore estimate a minimum age of @xmath1674  gyr for lbds  53w091 based upon comparison with the near  uv spectra of nearby elliptical galaxies .      in   4.1 we fit the uv spectrum of the integrated light from lbds  53w091 with the spectrum of a single star . in this section",
    ", we make an attempt to fit the spectrum with a composite stellar population . in the present approximation",
    ", we synthesize the spectrum using a series of _ main  sequence _ stellar models .",
    "this approach assumes that the uv emission from the galaxy is composed entirely of starlight from main  sequence stars at and below the main  sequence turnoff .",
    "this ignores the contribution of subgiants and giants ( the population just above the turnoff ) , but the impact of these stars on the near  uv spectrum of a fairly old ( @xmath168 ) population should be minimal , with almost all of the @xmath169   light arising near the main  sequence turnoff point ( charlot , personal communication ; see also figure  [ 4gyrstars ] ) .    employing the stellar atmosphere models of kurucz ( 1992 ) and a miller and scalo ( 1979 ) initial mass function ( imf ) , we determined the spectral energy distribution for composite populations of different ages by integrating the light from the total main  sequence population ( , from the turnoff mass to the lower mass cutoff of the imf ) .",
    "we computed the models for three different values of the metallicity , @xmath170 , @xmath145 , and @xmath171 .",
    "we then compared the continuum spectra of the resulting models and lbds  53w091 over the spectral range @xmath172  ( see figure  [ raulmodels ] ) .",
    "since the kurucz model atmospheres incorporate poorly known opacities for the uv metal absorption lines and are known to poorly reproduce some of the details of the uv spectra of f ( and later - type ) stars , the hottest main  sequence star permissible in the composite spectrum is primarily constrained by the general shape of the spectrum and the flux at @xmath173 .",
    "the best fitting composite solar metallicity main  sequence model has a blue limiting ( , `` turnoff '' ) temperature of @xmath174 k which corresponds to a stellar mass of 1.35  m@xmath175 and a main  sequence lifetime of 3.5  gyr .",
    "the stellar ages for main  sequence stars in this mass range are robust , and are not strongly affected by uncertainties in mass loss rates , convective overshooting , mixing length theory , or the equation of state .",
    "the best fitting solar and twice solar metallicity main  sequence models are also able to reproduce the 2640  break amplitude and observed @xmath176 color at an age of @xmath177 3.5  gyr , but do not reproduce the 2900  break or the @xmath178 and @xmath179 colors until ages of @xmath180 5  gyr ( see figures  [ breaksall ] and [ rk ] ) .",
    "the @xmath181 model is unable to reproduce the breaks or the @xmath176 color for ages less than 6  gyr , and the ir colors for ages less than 13  gyr .",
    "we note here that the variation of the break amplitudes with age is very similar for the main  sequence model described here and the `` full '' evolutionary model ( which includes the post ",
    "main sequence stars ) described below in   4.4.4 ; this ratifies our assumption that the breaks are dominated by starlight from the main  sequence population of stars over the relevant range of ages .",
    "the inconsistent ages determined from fitting the rest frame uv spectrum ( including the break amplitudes ) versus those determined using the optical and near  ir broad - band colors most likely result from the absence of post  main  sequence stars in these models .",

    "the minimum age derived from the main  sequence solar metallicity models is @xmath74 3.5  gyr .      in this section",
    "we discuss age estimates derived by fitting the spectrum of lbds  53w091 with the evolutionary population synthesis models of bruzual and charlot ( 1997 ) , worthey ( 1994 ) , guiderdoni and rocca  volmerange ( 1987 ) , and our own synthesis model ( jimenez 1997 ) .",

    "the worthey ( 1994 ) models utilize the kurucz ( 1992 ) theoretical stellar atmospheres as the input uv spectral library , and therefore can be used to determine spectral sythesis ages as a function of metallicity and thereby investigate the age  metallicity degeneracy .",
    "it is important to note that the kurucz model model atmospheres incorporate poorly known opacities for the uv metal absorption lines and therefore do not adequately reproduce some of the details of the uv spectra of f ( and later - type ) stars ; hence , the age of lbds  53w091 determined from these models is primarily constrained by the general shape of the spectrum and the flux at @xmath173 .",

    "as discussed in the previous section , m32 has an intermediate  age stellar population ( @xmath167 4 gyr ) whose radiation should dominate in the near  uv part of the spectrum .",
    "one of the most widely used evolutionary synthesis models is that of bruzual and charlot ( 1993 ; see also charlot & bruzual 1991 , bruzual 1983 ) . in their present version (  bc95 \" ; bruzual and charlot 1997 ) ,",
    "these models only incorporate evolutionary tracks and spectra for stars of solar metallicity .",
    "these models produce very red optical  infrared colors shortly after the initial burst of star  formation : the observed optical  infrared color of lbds  53w091 ( @xmath185 at @xmath3 ) is reproduced at @xmath186  gyr ( depending slightly upon the assumed imf ) after the initial burst ( see figure  [ rk ] ) .",
    "fitting the overall shape of the rest frame uv spectrum results in a best - fit age of 1.3  gyr .",
    "however , to also produce the spectral discontinuities of the strengths observed in lbds  53w091 an age in excess of 3.5  gyr is required .",
    "figure  [ breaksall ] and [ rk ] illustrate the inconsistencies in population ages derived from these evolutionary models , if a single burst is demanded for simplicity .    in table",
    "[ m32ages ] we see a similar quandry when bc95 is used to age  date m32 .",
    "the @xmath128 color index yields an extremely young ages ( @xmath1671.3 gyr ) for m32 , and is inconsistent with the results discussed in   4.2 .",
    "the break amplitudes , however , lead to more reasonable ages of @xmath177 3.5  gyr , suggesting that greater weight should be placed on the bc95 model fits to the spectral breaks , rather than on the fits to the overall spectrum .",
    "this procedure then suggests a large age for lbds  53w091 : the bc95 model fits to the spectral breaks imply ages of @xmath187  gyr .",
    "accounting for the large error ranges in the break amplitude measurements for lbds  53w091 , the bc95 models suggest a minimum age of @xmath188  gyr ( figure  [ breaksall ] ) .",
    "recently , models constructed by g.  worthey have been employed to age  date the populations in elliptical galaxies by using indices determined from the rest frame optical spectrum ( worthey 1994 , worthey 1996 ) .",
    "worthey has kindly computed some uv models with metallicities of @xmath189 = \\pm 0.2 , 0.0 $ ] at various ages ; a good fit to the uv spectrum and the @xmath176 color of lbds  53w091 occurs for the solar metallicity models at an age of @xmath167 1.4  gyr ( figure  [ rk ] ) .",
    "however , as in the case of the bruzual and charlot models , the breaks at 2640 , 2900   are not reproduced at this age . for solar abundance models , the 2640  and 2900  break amplitudes are only reproduced at ages of roughly 1.5  gyr and 4.3  gyr respectively . allowing the metallicity to vary , we find that the break amplitudes increase more ( less ) rapidly for the higher ( lower ) abundance models .",
    "for the three metallicities considered , no models are capable of reproducing both the detailed spectroscopic features of lbds  53w091 and the broad  band colors at the same age .",
    "in fact , these models do not produce self ",
    "consistent age estimates for m32 either and the 2640  break amplitude implies an exceedingly low estimate ( @xmath167 2.2 gyr ) for the age of m32 when compared with the current literature discussed in   4.2 .",
    "we conclude that it is premature to extrapolate these models , which were designed for the study of features in the optical spectra of nearby galaxies , into the rest frame uv .",
    "we also estimated the age of lbds  53w091 using the most recent version of the evolutionary synthesis models of guiderdoni and rocca  volmerange ( 1987 , hereinafter g&rv ) .",
    "these models , like the bc95 models , only incorporate a solar metallicity stellar library , and therefore can not be used to investigate variations in metallicity .",
    "they only reproduce the rest frame uv spectrum at an age of @xmath190  gyr ( see figure  [ paris ] ) .",
    "satisfyingly , the infrared colors [ @xmath191 are also reproduced at roughly the same age , although the break amplitudes imply an even older age ( @xmath192  gyr ) .",
    "the g&rv models are therefore roughly self  consistent and imply a large age for lbds  53w091 .      in order to have an independent check on the model - dependent age estimates ( cf .",
    "charlot 1996 ) , we constructed our own population synthesis code ( jimenez 1997 ) .",
    "the code uses interior stellar models computed using jmstar9 ( james macdonald , personal comm . ) which incorporates the latest opal opacity calculations ( see iglesias & rogers 1996 and references therein ) ; for the low temperature atmospheres we incorporated the opacities from alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) ( alexander , personal comm . ) .",
    "models were computed for three values of metallicity ( @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 ) . since present - day elliptical galaxies show evidence for enhancements in @xmath132-process elements whereas fe - peak elements may be under - enhanced ( worthey , faber & gonzalez 1992 ; weiss , peletier & matteucci 1995 ) , we also computed tracks for @xmath132-enhanced metallicities to study the effects on the integrated spectra . in total , approximately 1000 tracks ( from the contracting hayashi track up to the tp - agb ) were computed for stars in the mass range 0.1 @xmath196 to 120 @xmath196 .",
    "these synthesis models are similar to the main  sequence models described in   4.2 , but they also incorporate the late stages of stellar evolution .",
    "we hereafter refer to these models as the ` full ' models .",
    "the code allows us to control the stellar physics that we input into the integrated population , and it is straightforward to investigate , for example , different mass loss laws , mixing length parameters , or helium abundance . for the late stellar evolutionary stages ( rgb , agb and hb ) , we used the procedure described in jimenez ( 1997 ) to follow the evolution of stars from the base of the rgb to the tp - agb phase .",
    "the mass loss on the rgb and agb was approximated using the empirical parametrizations of reimers ( 1975 ; see also reimers 1977 ) and vassiliades & wood ( 1993 ) respectively .",
    "this procedure allows different scenarios for stellar evolution to be investigated quickly and reliably . since the light from stars in post ",
    "main  sequence stages of stellar evolution contribute little to the total uv emission , the age determination using these models is insensitive to the exact parameters chosen to calculate the late stage evolution .",
    "we were careful not to overpopulate the post ",
    "main  sequence stages , and used the fuel consumption theorem to compute the relative number of stars in main sequence and post main  sequence phases .",
    "the set of kurucz ( 1992 ) atmospheric models was used to computed the integrated stellar spectra of the population .",
    "we calculated integrated spectra for populations spanning ages from 1 to 13 gyr , and estimated the age for lbds  53w091 using spectral fitting .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ raulmodels ] shows the spectrum of lbds  53w091 compared with synthetic spectra at three different model ages ( 1 , 3 and 5  gyr ) .",
    "an age of 2.5  gyr ( for solar metallicity ) gives a best fit to the overall spectrum and also matches the observed ir colors .",
    "the uv light in the ` full ' models at ages @xmath197  4  gyr is almost completely dominated by the main  sequence stars .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that these ages are in good agreement with those derived from main  sequence models .",
    "the effect of using the @xmath132-enhanced tracks was to reduce the estimated age by @xmath198  gyr .",
    "the model fits to the @xmath129 and @xmath130 break amplitudes yield ages of 3.8 and 6.6  gyr for lbds  53w091 .",
    "the situation is similar for m32 , where the fit to the uv color index gives an age of 3.7  gyr , while @xmath130 implies an age @xmath167 5.8  gyr . comparing the model fits to the break amplitudes and the uv color in tables  [ evolages ] and [ m32ages ] , we see",
    "that jimenez s full models imply that lbds  53w091 and m32 are of comparable ages .      in tables",
    "[ evolages ] and [ m32ages ] we compare the age estimates from our various methods .",
    "the `` mean age '' column in table  [ evolages ] lists the average of all the age estimates from a given model .",
    "the different models result in a wide range of ages for lbds  53w091 , partly due to differences in their treatments of the post  main sequence evolutionary phases ( agb , post  agb , horizontal branch , etc ; charlot et al .  1996 )",
    "as well as differing uv spectral libraries ( _ iue _ versus kurucz theoretical spectra ) . as mentioned above ,",
    "the kurucz atmospheric models incorporate poorly known opacities for the uv metal absorption lines and inadequately reproduce the detailed uv spectra of f ( and later - type ) stars .",
    "hence , the ages derived from most of the evolutionary synthesis models described above are primarily constrained by the overall shape of the uv spectrum and the spectral `` bump '' at @xmath199 .",
    "we therefore place the largest weight on the age determinations resulting from the newest models which incorporate the most recent opacity tables ( i.e. , the jimenez `` full '' models ) and those derived from the comparison of the break amplitudes measured in lbds  53w091 with those measured in other objects .",
    "finally , since the predicted @xmath130 break amplitude shows much less scatter among the different models , we believe that this break provides the most reliable age ",
    "estimate ; this is endorsed by the small scatter in @xmath130 exhibited by the main  sequence _ iue _ stars ( figure  [ b2900star ] ) .    ignoring the extrema , the model fitting as a whole suggests a minimum age of @xmath743.5  gyr for the population dominating the uv light from lbds  53w091 .",
    "the @xmath130 break amplitude by itself suggests a lower limit of @xmath744  gyr ; including only the jimenez `` full '' models and the @xmath130 break amplitude results in a lower limit of @xmath743.4  gyr .",
    "it is important to note that none of the age  estimates in table  [ evolages ] that are based on the break amplitudes are discrepant with a minimum age of @xmath1673.5  gyr with the exception of those derived from the worthey models .",
    "the ages based on the @xmath176 color and the @xmath128 index are also slightly lower than those determined from the @xmath130 break ; this is not fully understood , and may be indicative of a mixed population ( , with a spread of ages ; cf .",
    ", gonzlez 1993 ) , or a signature of a diluting uv component , or simply the inadequacy of the input spectral libraries . whatever the cause , it is important to note that any correction for other components to the uv light ( ,   4.9 ) results in even stronger break amplitudes , and therefore larger ages .",
    "the minimum age of 3.5  gyr resulting from the model fitting , is therefore a strong lower limit to the age of lbds  53w091 .    a comparison of the age ",
    "dating results for lbds  53w091 ( table  [ evolages ] ) with a similar analysis for m32 ( table  [ m32ages ] ) suggests that the populations dominating the uv light in these two systems have similar ages . since the overall uv spectrum of lbds  53w091 is slightly bluer than that of m32 , it is likely that the @xmath3 galaxy is slightly younger than m32 .",
    "given the inconsistencies between the various models and the current uncertain age of the uv population in m32 , we will adopt the conservative minimum age estimate of 3.5  gyr for the remainder of this paper .",
    "the age estimates derive in the previous sections depend little on the exact form of the imf , so long as it is smooth and the slope and the upper and lower mass cut - offs are reasonable",
    ". however , the above age estimates are all predicated on the absence of young , hot ( , o , b , and a ) stars in the spectrum of lbds  53w091 .",
    "the possibility therefore exists that the spectrum of lbds  53w091 merely reflects an imf devoid of high mass stars and that the galaxy is young .",
    "no direct evidence exists that the galaxy contains evolved giants .",
    "however , a truncated imf would be a rather contrived explanation for lbds  53w091 s spectrum , requiring an imf that cut off exactly at spectral type f6v to escape the above age estimates . with no stars",
    "@xmath177 1.5 m@xmath175 , the genesis and disbursement of metals within the galaxy becomes problematic , though the effect of these constituents are clearly visible in the 2800 absorption line as well as the spectral breaks at 2640  and 2900 .",
    "furthermore , discussions of truncated imfs usually involve a suppression of the _ low _ mass stars to escape the g  dwarf problem ( , charlot 1993 ) .",
    "starbursts appear to favor high  mass stars .",
    "we therefore find truncating the imf a contrived explanation for lbds  53w091 s spectrum .",
    "the derived age estimates are also predicated on the assumption of an instantaneous burst of star formation .",
    "the implications of this conservative assumption are discussed in   5 , though the possibility exists that the uv spectrum of lbds  53w091 reflects multiple bursts of star formation . in the particular case of double  burst star formation scenarios ,",
    "the uv continuum and uv color are dominated by the youngest stars while the break amplitudes reflect the older stars diluted by the flatter spectrum younger population .",
    "for example , using the bc95 models , the uv continuum slope of lbds  53w091 is reproduced shortly after each burst , but at these young ages the model breaks are always overly suppressed by the hot stars , implying that no simple double  burst scenario can satisfactorily fit all criteria simultaneously .",
    "this is perhaps unsurprising when one considers the ages derived for m32 in table  [ m32ages ] : it is _ highly _ unlikely that m32 has a stellar population younger than 2  gyr , implying that the low ages derived from the uv continuum spectra are more emblematic of the weaknesses of the current generation of uv evolutionary models rather than a complicated star formation history .      as is clear from the spectral synthesis models described in ",
    "4.3 and 4.4 , more metal rich populations can reproduce the rest frame uv spectrum of lbds  53w091 at younger ages .",
    "metal poor populations with metallicities of @xmath181 , on the other hand , can only reproduce the shape of the uv spectrum and the break amplitudes at ages greater than 5  gyr .",
    "this is the well - studied problem of the age - metallicity degeneracy that plagues population synthesis ; in the case of the nearby elliptical galaxies , several optical spectral indices ( involving hydrogen and metal lines ) have been devised to separate the effects of age and metallicity ( , worthey 1994 , gorgas 1993 , jones 1996 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the optical faintness of lbds  53w091 ( @xmath200 ) precludes a direct measurement of the metallicity , especially because the hydrogen balmer and metal line indices commonly used to break the age - metallicity degeneracy are redshifted into the near ",
    "ir for redshifts @xmath201 .",
    "it is possible that future efforts with infrared spectrographs and adaptive optics on large telescopes will permit a measurement of abundances in the integrated light using features that are well - studied in local elliptical galaxies . for the present , the age estimates of lbds  53w091 remain degenerate with metallicity .",
    "however , if we assume that lbds  53w091 is a progenitor of a present - day elliptical galaxy and that no active star formation has taken place over the last @xmath167 11 gyr ( lookback time to @xmath3 for = 50 , @xmath120 ) , then the mean metallicity of lbds  53w091 should be very similar to that found for local @xmath202 elliptical galaxies .",
    "nearby elliptical galaxies with luminosities larger than @xmath20 generally have spatially integrated metallicities ( determined from the integrated spectrum ) that are approximately solar ( worthey 1984 ; kormendy & djorgovski 1989 ; worthey , faber & gonzlez 1992 ; sadler 1992 ) . within the effective radius @xmath203 , the luminosity  averaged metallicity of nearby luminous ellipticals is roughly solar .",
    "for example , the mg index of luminous ellipticals is @xmath74 0.30 in the nuclear regions ( , super  solar metallicity of @xmath204 = + 0.2 $ ] in the core ) , whereas it decreases to @xmath74 0.22 at radii near @xmath203 ( buzzoni 1996 ) , implying sub  solar metallicities , @xmath204 \\sim -0.3~{\\rm to}~-0.4.$ ] gonzalez & gorgas ( 1996 ) present mg index profiles for several giant ellipticals , again suggesting a similar mean mg index of @xmath205 for radii of 0.5 @xmath203 to @xmath206 arimoto ( 1996 ) concludes that a mean metallicity of solar is appropriate for nearby ellipticals based on measurements of the abundance in the hot corona and old stars .    the effective radius , @xmath207 of an @xmath20 galaxy at @xmath208 is @xmath209 ( , dickinson 1995 ) .",
    "hence , our 1  spectroscopic slit samples the galaxian profile to almost @xmath206 it is therefore reasonable to assume that the uv population in lbds  53w091 has a metallicity which is approximately solar within the aperture of our observations . even for twice solar metallicity , the break amplitudes imply an age in excess of 3  gyr for lbds  53w091 ( see dunlop 1996 , figure  2c ) .",
    "thus far , we have avoided the conclusion that dust reddening of a young stellar population is responsible for the red color of lbds  53w091 .",
    "the most important objection to strong dust reddening is that stellar populations younger than @xmath210  gyr fail to reproduce the spectral features observed in the rest frame uv spectrum .",
    "in addition , the @xmath129 and @xmath130 spectral breaks used in the preceding discussion are defined over short , adjacent wavelength intervals of the uv spectrum , and are therefore virtually reddening independent .",
    "we noted earlier that in most cases , the @xmath129 and @xmath130 continuum breaks suggested an age similar to that implied by the broader baseline @xmath128 color index , suggesting that the reddening is negligible . as a test , we dereddened the spectrum using an lmc extinction law and an @xmath211 ( , @xmath212 ) .",
    "the best fitting bruzual and charlot model to this dereddened spectrum has an age of @xmath213  gyr but provides a poor fit to the break amplitudes and the optical - ir colors .    for the remainder of this paper we consider @xmath214  gyr a minimum for galaxy lbds  53w091 .",
    "a similar minimum age is likely to apply to galaxy 3a , by virtue of its spatial proximity to lbds  53w091 and its similar spectral energy distribution .",
    "the implications of finding two very red galaxies in close proximity and at similar redshifts is discussed in   5 .",
    "the agn may contribute to the ultraviolet continuum emission in lbds  53w091 , either directly or by dust and electron scattering as it typically does in more powerful radio galaxies ( , di serego alighieri 1989 ; cimatti 1993 ; jannuzi 1996 ; dey & spinrad 1996 ) .",
    "the agn continuum would tend to dilute the spectral features and the break amplitudes , and hence accounting for this component in the spectrum would make the intrinsic break amplitudes even larger and imply an even older age .",
    "since the breaks at 2640  and 2900  are already strong , are comparable to those in individual stars , and fail to be reproduced by most of the population synthesis models , it is unlikely that the agn contribution is significant at uv wavelengths . a second indication that the agn contribution is likely to be very minimal is the apparent lack of strong emission lines in the uv spectrum : the limits on the ] , ] and emission lines are roughly 10 times fainter than that observed in powerful ( 3cr ) radio galaxies at similar redshifts ( mccarthy 1993 ) .",
    "we can make a rough estimate of the uv contribution from an agn in lbds  53w091 by comparing it with the powerful 3cr radio galaxies .",
    "the radio power at 1.4  ghz of lbds  53w091 is approximately 50 times smaller than that of a typical 3cr radio galaxy at @xmath215 .",
    "if the uv luminosity of the agn is also reduced by this factor , the observed @xmath60 band magnitude ( rest frame @xmath216   ) of lbds  53w091 would be @xmath217 mag , or approximately one third of the observed near  uv flux .",
    "this contribution , if present , would only dilute the break amplitudes , implying an even greater age for lbds  53w091 . since the present age estimate already provides stringent constraints to the cosmological parameters , it is unlikely that the diluting agn contribution is significant .      in old galactic star clusters , blue stragglers ( thought to be hot binary stars or stellar merger remnants ) can contribute significantly to the total short wavelength uv flux from the cluster .",
    "these stars are brighter , and often considerably bluer than the stars near the main  sequence turnoff in cluster color  magnitude diagrams .",
    "most importantly , they are not represented in any of the contemporary theoretical isochrones used by extant spectral synthesis models .",
    "thus , if the integrated spectra of galaxies are similar to those of old galactic clusters and contain a contribution from a blue straggler population , the present synthesis models will underestimate their age .",
    "to examine the situation quantitatively , we utilized color  magnitude arrays ( milone & latham 1994 ) and a luminosity function from m67 ( montgomery 1993 , fan 1996 ) for the clusters listed in table [ bstrags ] .",
    "we crudely estimated the blue straggler contribution to the integrated uv light from clusters ( @xmath218 ) under the assumption that the blue stragglers have uv spectra resembling their main  sequence ( @xmath219 ) analogs and assuming that the mass function determined for m67 ( montgomery 1993 ) is applicable to all clusters . for m67 itself , our most robust blue straggler case , these stars contribute approximately one half of the total light at 2600 . at the other extreme ,",
    "the solitary bright blue straggler star in ngc  752 makes up only 20% of the integrated uv flux from the cluster .",
    "the other clusters listed in table [ bstrags ] lie roughly between these extremes .",
    "hence , if the stellar content of lbds  53w091 is similar to that of the galactic clusters , blue stragglers _ may _ be responsible for as much as @xmath220 of the uv flux .",
    "accounting for this contribution will , as in the case of the agn , increase the age of the turnoff population .",
    "our reliance on the isochrone models described in   4.3 for estimating the age of lbds  53w091 spectrum is undoubtedly naive ; however , most of the substantive uncertainties point toward our mean age of 3.5  gyr ( or _ any _ age determined using these models ) being a lower bound .",
    "the 3.5  gyr minimum age we deduce in   4 is almost certainly a significant under ",
    "estimate of the true age of lbds  53w091 .",
    "first , this age assumes that the fairly large elliptical galaxy was formed in an instantaneous stellar burst after which star formation completely ceased .",
    "more realistically , the initial episode of star formation is likely to last at least one dynamical collapse time , @xmath221 yrs . if one assumes an extended episode of star formation , the derived total age increases in direct agreement with the assumed duration of the star formation burst ; the ages derived in ",
    "4 are actually the time elapsed since the cessation of star formation in the galaxy , since the uv spectrum for old populations is dominated by stars at the main  sequence turnoff .",
    "second , it is rather unlikely that the turnoff population that dominates the uv starlight is a result of the _ first _ episode of star formation .",
    "because the metallicity of the population is almost certainly non - primordial , the gas from which the present uv  dominant population was formed must have been enriched by previous episodes of star formation . the duration of these previous star forming episodes , and the time between the earlier episodes and the present one , must also be added to the age of the galaxy .",
    "future spectroscopic observations of lbds  53w091 in the near and mid  ir may allow us to determine its giant content and thereby constrain the contribution from previous bursts to the integrated spectrum .",
    "therefore , in accounting for the original dynamical collapse time of the galaxy , and multiple , non  instantaneous episodes of star formation , the adopted ` age ' of 3.5  gyr is found to provide a conservative lower bound to the true age of the galaxy .",
    "independent of cosmology , the discovery of a high redshift galaxy with a spectrum nearly identical to that of nearby , old elliptical galaxies has the profound implication that the epoch of formation of these early type systems must be at very high redshifts ( @xmath222 ) . if the other red galaxies which lie nearby ( in projection ) are indeed physically associated with lbds  53w091 , they raise the additional problem of an early epoch for structure formation .",
