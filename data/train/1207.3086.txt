    "in the holographic approach to condensed matter physics there is great freedom in how a bulk theory is constructed .",
    "this has the advantage of allowing the construction of holographic models which capture a wide variety of physical phenomena .",
    "the drawback , of course , is that the detailed phenomenology of such constructions typically depends on the particular model employed .",
    "for this reason a desirable feature of any phenomenological holographic programme is the existence of some ` universal result ' , at least for a particular class of bulk theories .",
    "a celebrated example is the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density for strongly coupled , isotropic holographic plasmas arising from two derivative bulk lagrangians @xcite .",
    "holographic superconductivity on the other hand has no simple universal sector ; in the minimal example of a single @xmath1-charged bulk scalar field there is freedom to specify the potential and gauge field coupling . in a bottom - up approach , whilst the small - field expansion of these functions can be easily parameterised , the behaviour away from the critical temperature depends strongly on their nonlinear characteristics .",
    "turning to a top - down approach one may hope to overcome such difficulties .",
    "however , as observed in @xcite , different consistent sub - truncations of a particular top - down model exhibit radically different results for the behaviour of the superconducting order parameter with temperature . to understand",
    "if there are any generic features for the landscape of consistent holographic superconductors , one must delve deeper into larger families of consistent truncations .",
    "see @xcite for some interesting work along these lines .    in this paper",
    "we take a step in this direction by considering a truncation of @xmath2 @xmath0 gauged supergravity in 5d containing 20 scalars and 15 gauge fields .",
    "the truncation contains a three - charge family of black branes @xcite , dual to a normal phase , about which we look for the emergence of new branches of superconductors .",
    "such branches are indicated by the existence of marginal modes for the various charged scalar fields at finite temperature .",
    "this calculation can be viewed as a first step towards understanding the sequence of preferred phases of the full supergravity theory .",
    "when cooled sufficiently the black branes we employ to model the normal phase become thermodynamically unstable .",
    "of the full 10d theory , this instability corresponds to the one - by - one fragmentation of d3-branes from the rotating stack .",
    "the superconducting branches we seek in this work are local instabilities of the black brane solutions , and whilst they may be subject to arguments vis -  - vis metastability , a study of the critical temperatures and chemical potential dependence is not directly affected by it .",
    "the family of black branes used here represents a convenient local minimum for our purposes . ]",
    "note that in many cases the stable black brane simply ceases to exist at low temperatures , and so the system is largely immune to any @xmath3 test of stability , such as breitenlohner - freedman ( bf ) bound violation for any near horizon @xmath4 .",
    "we focus on superconducting instabilities that occur in the normal phase at sufficiently high temperatures where it is locally thermodynamically stable .",
    "we find that a superconducting black brane branch always exists in this region of the normal phase .",
    "in addition , the black brane solutions we employ for the normal phase have three r - charges , which allows us to explore the dependence of the various superconducting phase transitions on the conjugate chemical potentials .",
    "some modes in the truncation are charged under a single @xmath1 and do not couple to the other gauge fields at the linearised level . as such , turning on an additional chemical potential for another @xmath1 provides an effective holographic description of a state with a density imbalance .",
    "an example in condensed matter physics is an imbalanced fermi mixture in which there is a mismatch of chemical potentials for spin - up and spin - down constituents @xcite .",
    "phenomenological holographic models of such mixtures were investigated in bottom - up bulk and probe brane constructions in @xcite , where the additional @xmath1 plays the role of up - down spin imbalance .",
    "one feature of these models is that the superconducting phase ceases to exist if the imbalance is too great .",
    "here we have an imbalance as a natural consequence of the three chemical potentials . as the imbalance for a given superconducting mode",
    "is increased , its critical temperature decreases until it reaches the threshold of thermodynamic instability , at finite temperature . however , increasing the imbalance for one mode decreases the imbalance for another , and is a consequence of the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "surprisingly there is no set of chemical potentials for which the imbalance is simultaneously too great for all modes .",
    "the paper proceeds as follows . in section [ sec : trunc ] we present the consistent truncation and the three - chemical potential black brane solution we will be employing as the background normal phase . in section [ sec : fluctuations ] we calculate the field equations for homogeneous fluctuations of the other fields in the truncation about this background that do not source gravitational fluctuations .",
    "the structure of the equations for the fluctuations and the instabilities found naturally leads to two different types of mode : modes that are continuously connected to charged modes are discussed in [ sec : minusmodes ] , while those that are continuously connected to neutral modes are discussed in section [ sec : plusmodes ] . in both cases we map out the regions in the space of chemical potentials which are unstable to each mode and",
    "detail their critical temperatures .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in addition to gravity , the bosonic sector of @xmath2 @xmath0 gauged supergravity in 5d @xcite contains 42 scalars , 15 @xmath0 gauge fields as well as twelve 2-form gauge potentials .",
    "the scalars are organised into irreps of @xmath0 which have masses @xmath5 in an @xmath6 vacuum , the lightest of which saturates the bf - bound .",
    "we will employ a further consistent truncation of this theory down to 15 gauge fields and 20 of the bf - bound saturating scalars . in 10d ingredients",
    "this truncation corresponds to retaining only the metric and 5-form @xcite .",
    "this truncation provides a convenient starting point in our search for superconducting black brane branches .",
    "first , the truncation contains a three - parameter family of black brane backgrounds which we may employ as the normal phase .",
    "second , only the lightest scalars remain and these should display a greater susceptibility to forming condensates in the black brane backgrounds . finally , we are able to make contact with special cases studied elsewhere at the nonlinear level .",
    "the 20 scalars and 15 gauge fields can be packaged as a symmetric unimodular @xmath0 tensor @xmath7 and an antisymmetric @xmath0 tensor @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the equations of motion for this consistent truncation may be derived from the following action , with the adjoint @xmath0 indices written in matrix form : [ eq : action ] s = d^5x ( r - t^-1 ( d_t ) t^-1 ( d^t ) + t^-1 f _ t^-1 f^ - v ) we have omitted a chern - simons term that will not be important for the electric , homogeneous superconductors sought here .",

    "these modes satisfy equations and and consequently it is precisely this mode which gives rise to the black line in figure [ fig : slice ] .",
    "it is also the zero mode generated by the thermodynamically unstable directions discussed in section [ sec : branches ] .",
    "we expect that there is also a true instability associated with these fluctuations @xcite but it is not captured by a zero mode analysis .",
    "we also anticipate a true instability away from the lines of equal chemical potentials , provided gravitational fluctuations are included .",
    "we have found new branches of superconducting black branes in @xmath2 @xmath0 gauged supergravity , coming from a truncation involving 20 scalar fields and 15 gauge fields .",
    "superconductivity persists to any values of the chemical potentials conjugate to the three r - charge densities of the background black brane .",
    "the critical temperatures at which these black brane solutions arise is always higher than the temperature at which the three - charge background becomes thermodynamically unstable .",
    "it is known that in some special cases  such as two and three non - zero equal chemical potentials  one has ` retrograde condensation ' , _ i.e. _  the branch of superconducting black branes is thermodynamically subdominant and the condensate exists only above a critical temperature @xcite ( see also @xcite in 4d ) .",
    "the other previously studied case of this system is that of one non - zero chemical potential , where the superconducting black brane is thermodynamically dominant @xcite . here , in all known cases of retrograde condensation",
    ", we find that there is an additional marginal mode with the same critical temperature ( see figure [ fig : highesttc ] ) .",
    "we leave a nonlinear investigation of this branch , and whether it is dominant , to future work .    for a given mode we may interpret dialling the chemical potentials as introducing an imbalanced mixture as initiated in @xcite .",
    "the critical temperature surface can not be extended to arbitrarily low temperatures as the imbalance is dialled , due the presence of a thermodynamic instability in the normal phase at finite temperature . at a given set of chemical potentials , different modes in the consistent truncation experience a different effective imbalance .",
    "interestingly , we find that before a superconducting instability vanishes as a function of its imbalance , another appears to take its place .",
    "the difference of the chemical potentials sets a scale for the system",
    ". it would be interesting to see if this scale sets a value of spatial momentum in this truncation resulting in an inhomogeneous , fflo - like phase @xcite .",
    "see @xcite . ]",
    "it would also be interesting to construct all of the superconducting branches found nonlinearly , away from the critical temperature .",
    "this would allow the direct comparison of the free energy with the normal phase , and consequently the identification of the true phase boundary for the spontaneous breaking of a @xmath1-bulk symmetry .    for many of the linear modes studied in this paper , labelled by @xmath71",
    ", we have found only neutral marginal modes , whose role is to move one infinitesimally within the family of background black branes .",
    "these modes occur precisely at the threshold temperature for thermodynamic instability .",
    "as such the marginal modes do not generate an actual instability of the black brane .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to populate the entire minimum temperature surface ( as a function of chemical potentials ) with zero modes of the background black brane , which can be found analytically and involve gravitational fluctuations in general .",
    "one expects to find a true instability associated with the thermodynamic instability in these cases .",
    "our work was motivated in part by the search for universal features in top - down holographic superconductivity .",
    "we wish to highlight a basic problem we have encountered when using consistent truncations : a subdominant solution in a given theory can appear as the dominant solution in a consistent truncation of that theory .",
    "this is exemplified by the normal phase solutions employed in this paper .    in the case of three equal chemical potentials",
    "the normal phase solution is simply rn at high temperatures .",
    "whilst the rn branch exists at low temperatures too , it is no longer the dominant contribution to the ensemble .",
    "this has important consequences for the equal-@xmath17 consistent truncation where rn is the only normal phase solution remaining . evidently in the equal-@xmath17 truncation rn",
    "appears as the dominant black brane branch at all temperatures , when in fact , at low temperatures in the full theory it is subdominant to a thermodynamically unstable black brane .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank aristomenis donos , jerome gauntlett , mukund rangamani and julian sonner for helpful discussions .",
    "sag is supported by a stfc studentship .",
    "bw is supported by the royal commission for the exhibition of 1851 .",
    "using @xmath135 as a parameter along the branch of solutions and writing @xmath136 we find that @xmath137 are given by q_1 = , q_2 = .",
    "there are therefore up to four solutions coming from the sign choices for @xmath138 and @xmath139 . in these",
    "coordinates the thermodynamic potential density becomes = - and so we see that at some desired grand canonical coordinate , @xmath36 , the dominant configurations live on the @xmath140 branch , provided it exists there .",
    "the temperature is stationary at the threshold for thermodynamic stability : |__1,_2 & = & - + & & 2 and furthermore , on the @xmath140 branch the temperature is a minimum there : @xmath141 .",
    "this shows that there is a branch of black branes which only exists above the threshold temperature for thermodynamic stability , where it dominates the ensemble .",
