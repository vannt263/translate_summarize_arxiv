    "a theory for the description of metastable states was formulated by j. langer long ago@xcite . the formalism and",
    "its quantum extensions@xcite revealed the connection between the decay rate and the free energy of a saddle - point configuration @xmath0 of the euclidean action with a single negative eigenvalue .",
    "in general , @xmath0 interpolates the local minimum ( the false , metastable vaccum ) and the global minimum ( the true vacuum ) of the action .",
    "the decay rate is given by @xmath1 where the pre - factor @xmath2 is formally written in terms of the determinant of ( quantum and thermal ) fluctuations around @xmath0 . in the end , we are led to the problem of calculating the one - loop effective action around @xmath0 .",
    "in this paper , we present a finite - temperature semiclassical procedure to obtain the pre - factor of the decay rate as an alternative to the traditional approach which uses matsubara sums@xcite .",
    "our approach appears more appropriate to be generalized to the case of non - static saddle - point configurations .",
    "semiclassical methods have been successfully applied to quantum statistical mechanics . in this approach , the path - integral expression for the partition function",
    "is calculated using the steepest descent method .",
    "saddle - points of the action are solutions of the euclidean equations of motion , and configurations in the vicinity of these classical solutions dominate the path integral",
    ". the contribution of such configurations can be systematically incorporated , defining a semiclassical series . in the particular case of one - dimensional quantum - mechanical systems",
    ", it is possible to generate all the terms of the series using the semiclassical propagator which , in turn , is determined by the classical solution@xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the first term of the semiclassical series can already produce accurate results .",
    "as an example , let us consider the single - well quartic potential : @xmath3 table [ t1 ] exhibts the ground - state energy for different values of the coupling @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we see that the semiclassical quadratic approximation is in good agreement with numerical techniques that used optimized perturbation theory , even for large values of the coupling .",
    "this serves as a motivation for the application of the semiclassical aproximation to finite - temperature quantum field theory .",

    "indeed , the partition function of a given ( scalar ) system can be cast in the form : @xmath7 \\int\\limits_{\\phi(0,\\x)=\\phi(\\beta,\\x)=\\varphi(\\x)}[d\\phi(\\tau,\\x ) ] \\;\\;\\;\\ ; e^{-s_{_{e}}(\\phi)}\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the euclidean action of the field : @xmath9\\ ; .\\ ] ] we assume that @xmath0 is a saddle - point of the action .",

    ", @xmath0 is a general non - static solution of .",
    "now , we proceed to calculate the contribution to the partition function coming from quadratic fluctuations around @xmath0 .",
    "we write @xmath12 .",
    "the only condition on the fluctuation @xmath13 is that @xmath14 . in practice",
    ", one can restrict the calculation to those configurations with finite action . as an example",
    ", one can think of @xmath0 as being a kink - like static profile .",
    "the finite action condition imposes that @xmath13 goes to zero at spatial infinity .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ilustrates a typical configuration with finite action in the vicinity of the kink at @xmath15 .    a careful expansion of the euclidean action around @xmath0 up to quadratic order produces : @xmath16 where @xmath17_{\\tau=0}^{\\tau=\\beta } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath18_{\\tau=0}^{\\tau=\\beta } \\;+\\;\\frac{1}{2 } \\int ( d^4x)_{_e}\\ ; \\eta(x)\\big[-\\square_{_e}+v^{\\prime\\prime}(\\phi_s(x))\\big]\\eta(x)\\ ; .\\ ] ]",
    "the boundary terms do not vanish because the boundary value of the fluctuation @xmath13 at @xmath19 is not zero . in other words , there are configurations close to @xmath0 whose boundary value is not the same as @xmath20 . in order to integrate ( [ eq : z ] ) over boundary values in the neighborhood of @xmath21 , we can use the techniques of ref .",
    "@xcite , which incorporate fluctuations of boundary conditions .",
    "we write the boundary field as @xmath22 , and expand the action up to quadratic order in @xmath23 . to be consistent with the quadratic approximation",
    ", we introduce a number of important simplifications which make the problem tractable .",
    "it is possible to show that @xmath24 around @xmath0 is given by the following formula : @xmath25 where    [ eq : propagator ] @xmath26 g(x;x^\\prime ) = \\delta^{(4)}(x - x^\\prime)\\\\ g(\\tau,\\x;0,\\x^\\prime)=g(\\tau,\\x;\\beta,\\x^\\prime)=0\\;. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from ( [ eq : z2 ] ) , we obtain the pre - factor defined in ( [ gamma ] ) . in special cases , the green function ( [ eq : propagator ] )",
    "can be analytically calculated .",

    "numerical results will be presented in a future publication@xcite .",
    "we presented a systematic procedure to calculate decay rates of metastable states in finite temperature quantum field theory using semiclassical methods .",
    "decay rates are directly related to the one - loop effective action around a saddle point of the euclidean action .",
