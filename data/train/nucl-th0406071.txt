    "many of the features contained in the few body structure models are essential for a good description of the reaction process .    in this paper , we present a self contained program that provides a solution to a general three body problem where one of the clusters is allowed to excite . in section ii a brief overview of the construction of the three body basis is presented . in section",

    "our intention was to develop a general tool to handle the bound state properties of a nucleus well described as a three body system _ i+j+k _ where one of the particles _ is allowed to excite_. face is based on solving the faddeev equations @xcite with a hyperspherical formulation of the general three body problem @xcite .",
