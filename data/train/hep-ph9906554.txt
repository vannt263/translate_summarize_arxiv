    "in the last few years a great deal of attention has been paid to the study of interacting quantum fields out of equilibrium .",
    "there are , in fact , many interesting physical situations in which the standard s",
    " matrix approach can not give sensible information about the behavior of the system , because it evolves through a series of highly excited states ( i.e. , states of finite energy density ) .",
    "as an example consider any model of cosmological inflation : it is not possible to extract precise predictions on physical observables without including in the treatment the quantum back  reaction of the field on the space  time geometry and on itself @xcite .    on the side of particle physics ,",
    "the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , scheduled in the forthcoming years at cern  sps , bnl  rhic and cern  lhc , are supposed to produce hadron matter at very high densities and temperatures ; in such a regime the usual approach based on particle scattering can not be considered a good interpretative tool at all . to extract sensible information from the theory new computational schemes are necessary , that go beyond the simple feynmann diagram expansion .",
    "the use of resummation schemes , like the hartree  fock ( hf ) @xcite approximation and the large @xmath1 limit ( ln ) @xcite , or the hard thermal loop resummation for systems at finite temperature ( htl ) @xcite , can be considered a first step in this direction .",
    "they , in fact , enforce a sum over an infinite subset of feynmann diagrams that are dominant in a given region of the parameter space , where the simple truncation of the usual perturbative series at finite order can not give sensible answers .",
    "quite recently hf and ln have been used in order to clarify some dynamical aspects of the large @xmath1 @xmath2 theory , reaching the conclusion that the non  perturbative and non  linear evolution of the system might eventually produce the onset of a form of non  equilibrium bose ",
    "einstein condensation of the long  wavelength goldstone bosons usually present in the broken symmetry phase @xcite of the model .",
    "another very interesting result in @xcite concerns the dynamical maxwell construction , which reproduces the flat region of the effective potential in case of broken symmetry as asymptotic fixed points of the background evolution .    in this article we present a detailed study , _ in finite volume _ , of dynamical evolution out of equilibrium for the @xmath3 scalar field .",
    "more precisely , we determine how such dynamics scales with the size of the periodic box containing the system in the case of uniform backgrounds .",
    "this is necessary to address questions like out  of  equilibrium symmetry breaking and dynamical bose ",
    "einstein condensation .",
    "we apply two of the non  perturbative methods mentioned above , namely the hartree ",
    "fock approximation and the large @xmath1 expansion .    in section [ cft ]",
    "we define the model in finite volume , giving all the relevant notations and definitions .",
    "we also stress the convexity of the effective potential as an exact result , valid for the full renormalized theory in any volume .    in section [ ln ]",
    "we derive the large @xmath1 approximation of the @xmath4invariant version of @xmath5 model , according to the general rules of ref . @xcite . in this derivation",
    "it appears evident the essential property of the @xmath6 limit of being a particular type of _ classical _ limit , so that it leads to a classical phase space , a classical hamiltonian with associated hamilton s equations of motion [ see eqs .",
    "( [ sk2 ] ) , ( [ nunbgap ] ) and ( [ nbgap ] ) ] .",
    "we then minimize the hamiltonian function(al ) and determine the conditions when massless goldstone bosons ( i.e. transverse fluctuations of the field ) to form a bose ",
    "einstein condensate , delocalizing the vacuum field expectation value ( cfr . also ref .",
    "this necessarily requires that the width of the zero  mode fluctuations becomes macroscopically large , that is of the order of the volume .",
    "only when the background takes one of the extremal values proper of symmetry breaking the width of the zero  mode fluctuations is of order @xmath7 , as typical of a free massless spectrum .",
    "the study of the lowest energy states of the model is needed for comparison with the results of the numerical simulations , which show that the zero  mode width @xmath8 stays microscopic ( that is such that @xmath9volume@xmath10 when the volume diverges ) whenever it starts from initial conditions in which it is microscopic .",
    "our results , in fact , show clearly the presence of a time scale @xmath11 , proportional to the linear size @xmath12 of the system , at which finite volume effects start to manifest .",
    "the most remarkable consequence of the presence of such a scale is that it prevents the zero mode amplitude to grow macroscopically large .",
    "this result contradicts the interpretation of the linear late  time growth of the zero  mode width as a bose ",
    "einstein condensation of goldstone bosons @xcite .",
    "on the other hand we do find that the size of the low  lying widths at time @xmath11 is of order @xmath12 , to be compared to the equilibrium situation where they would be of order @xmath13 in the massive case or of order @xmath7 in the massless case . perhaps the denomination `` microscopic '' should be reserved to this two possibilities .",
    "therefore , since our initial condition are indeed microscopic in this restricted sense , we do observe in the out  of  equilibrium evolution a rapid transition to a different regime intermediate between the microscopic one and the macroscopic one characteristic of bose ",
    "einstein condensation .    at any rate ,",
    "when one considers microscopic initial conditions for the choice of bare mass which corresponds to broken symmetry , the role itself of symmetry breaking is not very clear in the large @xmath1 description of the out  of  equilibrium dynamics , making equally obscure the issues concerning the so  called quantum phase ordering @xcite .",
    "this is because the limit @xmath6 is completely saturated by gaussian states , which might signal the onset of symmetry breaking only developing macroscopically large fluctuations . since such fluctuations do not appear to be there , the meaning itself of symmetry breaking , as something happening as times goes on and accompanied by some kind of phase ordering , is quite unclear .",
    "of course , in this respect the main limitation of our approach , as well as of those of the references mentioned above , is in the assumption of a uniform background .",
    "nonetheless , phenomena like the asymptotic vanishing of the effective mass and the dynamical maxwell construction , taking place in this contest of a uniform background and large @xmath1 expansion , are certainly very significant manifestations of symmetry breaking and in particular of the goldstone theorem which applies when a continuous symmetry is broken .    to gather more information on these matters , we consider in section [ tdhf ] a more elaborate type of time ",
    "dependent hartree  fock ( tdhf ) approximation , which generalizes the standard gaussian self - consistent approach to non ",
    "gaussian wave  functionals ; in fact , one might envisage the possibility that , while gaussian fluctuations never become of the size of the volume , non  gaussian fluctuations do grow in time to a macroscopic size .",
    "we derive therefore the mean  field coupled time ",
    "dependent schroedinger equations for the modes of the scalar field , under the assumption of a uniform condensate , see eqs ( [ schroedinger ] ) , ( [ h_k ] ) and ( [ omvev ] ) .",
    "a significant difference with respect to previous tdhf approaches @xcite concerns the renormalization of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "in fact , by means of a single proper substitution of the bare coupling constant @xmath14 with the renormalized one @xmath15 in the hartree  fock hamiltonian , we obtain completely cut - off independent equations ( apart from the corrections in inverse power of the cutoff which are there due to the landau pole ) . the substitution is introduced by hand , but is justified by simple diagrammatic considerations .",
    "one advantage of not restricting a priori the self - consistent hf approximation to gaussian wave  functionals , is in the possibility of a better description of the structure of the vacuum in case of broken symmetry .",
    "in fact we can show quite explicitly that , in any finite volume , the ground state the zero  mode of the @xmath16 field is concentrated around the two vacua of the broken symmetry , driving the probability distribution for any sufficiently wide smearing of the field into a two peaks shape .",
    "this is indeed what one would intuitively expect in case of symmetry breaking . on the other hand none of this appears in a dynamical evolution that starts from a distribution localized around a single value of the field in the spinodal region , confirming what already seen in the large @xmath1 approach .",
    "more precisely , within a further controlled gaussian approximation of our tdhf approach , one observe that initially microscopic quantum fluctuations never becomes macroscopic , suggesting that also non ",
    "gaussian fluctuations can not reach macroscopic sizes . as a simple confirmation of this fact ,",
    "consider the completely symmetric initial conditions @xmath17 for the background : in this case we find that the dynamical equations for initially gaussian field fluctuations are identical to those of large @xmath1 [ apart for a rescaling of the coupling constant by a factor of three ; compare eqs .",
    "( [ sk2 ] ) and ( [ emotion ] ) ] , so that we observe the same asymptotic vanishing of the effective mass .",
    "however , this time no interpretation in terms of goldstone theorem is possible , since the broken symmetry is discrete ; rather , if the width of the zero  mode were allowed to evolve into a macroscopic size , then the effective mass would tend to a positive value , since the mass in case of discrete symmetry breaking is indeed larger than zero .    on the other hand , also in the gaussian hf approach , we do find that the size of the low  lying widths at time @xmath11 is of order @xmath12 .",
    "we then discuss why this undermine the self ",
    "consistency of the gaussian approximation , imposing the need of further study , both analytical and numerical .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] we summarize the results presented in this article and we sketch some interesting open problems that we plan to study in forthcoming works .",
    "we consider the scalar field operator @xmath16 in a @xmath18dimensional periodic box of size @xmath12 and write its fourier expansion as customary @xmath19 with the wavevectors @xmath20 naturally quantized : @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the canonically conjugated momentum @xmath23 has a similar expansion @xmath24 with the commutation rules @xmath25=i\\delta^{(d)}_{kk'}$ ] .",
    "the introduction of a finite volume should be regarded as a regularization of the infrared properties of the model , which allows to `` count '' the different field modes and is needed especially in the case of broken symmetry .    to regularize also the ultraviolet behavior ,",
    "we restrict the sums over wavevectors to the points lying within the @xmath18dimensional sphere of radius @xmath26 , that is @xmath27 , with @xmath28 some large integer .",
    "clearly we have reduced the original field ",
    "theoretical problem to a quantum  mechanical framework with finitely many ( of order @xmath29 ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath2 hamiltonian reads @xmath30 = \\\\      & = \\dfrac12\\sum_k\\left[\\pi_k\\pi_{-k } + ( k^2 + \\mbare)\\,\\phi_k\\phi_{-k}\\right ]      + \\dfrac\\l4 \\sum_{k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4}\\phi_{k_1}\\phi_{k_2 }       \\phi_{k_3}\\phi_{k_4}\\,\\delta^{(d)}_{k_1+k_2+k_3+k_4,0 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath14 should depend on the uv cutoff @xmath26 in such a way to guarantee a finite limit @xmath32 for all observable quantities . as is known , this implies triviality ( that is vanishing of renormalized vertex functions with more than two external lines ) for @xmath33 and very likely also for @xmath34 . in the latter case triviality is manifest in the one  loop approximation and in large@xmath35 limit due to the landau pole .",
    "for this reason we shall keep @xmath26 finite and regard the @xmath2 model as an effective low  energy theory ( here low  energy means practically all energies below planck s scale , due to the large value of the landau pole for renormalized coupling constants of order one or less ) .",
    "we shall work in the wavefunction representation where @xmath36 and @xmath37 while for @xmath38 ( in lexicographic sense ) @xmath39 notice that by construction the variables @xmath40 are all real .",
    "of course , when either one of the cutoffs are removed , the wave function @xmath41 acquires infinitely many arguments and becomes what is usually called a _",
    "wavefunctional_.    in practice , the problem of studying the dynamics of the @xmath2 field out of equilibrium consists now in trying to solve the time - dependent schroedinger equation given an initial wavefunction @xmath42 that describes a state of the field far away from the vacuum .",
    "by this we mean a non  stationary state that , in the infinite volume limit @xmath43 , would lay outside the particle fock space constructed upon the vacuum .",
    "this approach could be generalized in a straightforward way to mixtures described by density matrices , as done , for instance , in @xcite . here",
    "we shall restrict to pure states , for sake of simplicity and because all relevant aspects of the problem are already present in this case .",
    "it is by now well known @xcite that perturbation theory is not suitable for the purpose stated above . due to parametric resonances and/or spinodal instabilities",
    "there are modes of the field that grow exponentially in time until they produce non  perturbative effects for any coupling constant , no matter how small . on the other hand ,",
    "only few , by now standard , approximate non  perturbative schemes are available for the @xmath2 theory , and to these we have to resort after all .",
    "we shall consider here the time - dependent hartree ",
    "fock ( tdhf ) approach ( an improved version with respect to what is presented , for instance , in @xcite ) and the large @xmath1 expansion to leading order . in fact these two methods are very closely related , as shown for instance in @xcite , where several techniques to derive reasonable dynamical evolution equations for non ",
    "equilibrium @xmath2 are compared . however , before passing to approximations , we would like to stress that the following rigorous result can be immediately established in this model with both uv and ir cutoffs .",
    "this is a well known fact in statistical mechanics , being directly related to stability requirements .",
    "it would therefore hold also for the field theory in the euclidean functional formulation . in our quantum  mechanical context we may proceed as follow .",
    "suppose the field @xmath16 is coupled to a uniform external source @xmath44 .",
    "then the ground state energy @xmath45 is a concave function of @xmath44 , as can be inferred from the negativity of the second order term in @xmath46 of perturbation around any chosen value of @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , @xmath45 is analytic in a finite neighborhood of @xmath47 , since @xmath48 is a perturbation `` small '' compared to the quadratic and quartic terms of the hamiltonian . as a consequence ,",
    "this effective potential @xmath49 , @xmath50 , that is the legendre transform of @xmath45 , is a convex analytic function in a finite neighborhood of @xmath51 . in the infrared limit @xmath43",
    ", @xmath45 might develop a singularity in @xmath47 and @xmath52 might flatten around @xmath51 . of course this possibility would apply in case of spontaneous symmetry breaking , that is for a double  well classical potential . this is a subtle and important point that will play a crucial role later on , even if the effective potential is relevant for the static properties of the model rather than the dynamical evolution out of equilibrium that interests us here .",
    "in fact such evolution is governed by the ctp effective action @xcite and one might expect that , although non  local in time , it asymptotically reduces to a multiple of the effective potential for trajectories of @xmath53 with a fixed point at infinite time . in such case there should exist a one  to ",
    "one correspondence between fixed points and minima of the effective potential .",
    "this is one of the topics addressed in this paper .",
    "in this section we consider a standard non  perturbative approach to the @xmath2 model which is applicable also out of equilibrium , namely the large @xmath1 method as presented in @xcite .",
    "however we shall follow a different derivation which makes the gaussian nature of the @xmath6 limit more explicit .    in the large @xmath1 method one generalizes the @xmath2 model by promoting the single real scalar field @xmath16 to a @xmath54component vector @xmath55 of scalar fields , in such a way to ensure @xmath56 symmetry .",
    "this corresponds to the hamiltonian @xmath57 = \\\\      & = \\frac12\\sum_k\\left[\\bds\\pi_k \\!\\cdot \\bds\\pi_{-k } + ( k^2 +    \\mbare)\\,\\bds\\phi_k \\!\\cdot \\bds\\phi_{-k}\\right ]      + \\dfrac\\lbare{4l^d } \\sum_{k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4 } ( \\bds\\phi_{k_1}\\!\\!\\cdot    \\bds\\phi_{k_2})(\\bds\\phi_{k_3 } \\!\\!\\cdot \\bds\\phi_{k_4 } )       \\,\\delta^{(d)}_{k_1+k_2+k_3+k_4,0 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where the space integration and the sum over wavevectors are limited by the infrared and ultraviolet cutoff , respectively , according to the general framework presented in section [ cft ] .",
    "it is known that this theory is well behaved for large @xmath1 , provided that the quartic coupling constant @xmath58 is rescaled with @xmath59 .",
    "for example , it is possible to define a perturbation theory , based on the small expansion parameter @xmath59 , in the framework of which one can compute any quantity at any chosen order in @xmath59 . from the diagrammatic point of view , this procedure corresponds to a resummation of the usual perturbative series that automatically collects all the graphs of a given order in @xmath59 together @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been established since the early 80 s that the leading order approximation ( that is the strict limit @xmath6 ) is actually a classical limit @xcite , in the sense that there exists a classical system ( i.e. , a classical phase space , a poisson bracket and a classical hamiltonian ) whose dynamics controls the evolution of all fundamental quantum observables , such as field correlation functions , in the @xmath6 limit .",
    "for instance , from the absolute minimum of the classical hamiltonian one reads the energy of the ground state , while the spectrum is given by the frequencies of small oscillations about this minimum , etc .",
    "etc .. we are here interested in finding an efficient and rapid way to compute the quantum evolution equations for some observables in the @xmath60 limit , and we will see that this task is easily accomplished just by deriving the canonical hamilton equations from the large @xmath1 classical hamiltonian .    following yaffe @xcite , we write the quantum mechanical hamiltonian as @xmath61 in terms of the square matrices @xmath62 , @xmath63 with operator entries ( * @xmath64 * is the canonical momentum conjugated to the real mode * @xmath40 * ) @xmath65 these are example of `` classical '' operators , whose two - point correlation functions factorize in the @xmath6 limit .",
    "this can be shown by considering the coherent states @xmath66 \\label{coh_states}\\ ] ] where the complex symmetric matrix @xmath67 has a positive definite real part while @xmath68 and @xmath69 are real and coincide , respectively , with the coherent state expectation values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "as these parameters take all their possible values , the coherent states form an overcomplete set in the cutoff hilbert space of the model .",
    "the crucial property which ensures factorization is that they become all orthogonal in the @xmath6 limit .",
    "moreover one can show @xcite that the coherent states parameters form a classical phase space with poisson brackets @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 reparametrize @xmath67 as @xmath75 .",
    "it is understood that the dimensionality of the vectors * @xmath76 * and * @xmath77 * is arbitrary but finite [ that is , only a finite number , say @xmath78 , of pairs @xmath79 may take a nonvanishing expectation value as @xmath6 ] .    once applied to the classical operators @xmath81 and @xmath82 the large @xmath1 factorization allow to obtain the classical hamiltonian by simply replacing @xmath62 and @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ hac ] ) by the coherent expectation values @xmath83 in our situation , having assumed a uniform background expectation value for @xmath16 , we have @xmath84 for all @xmath85 ; moreover , translation invariance implies that @xmath73 and @xmath74 are diagonal matrices , so that we may set @xmath86 in term of the canonical couples @xmath87 which satisfy @xmath88 .",
    "notice that the @xmath89 are just the widths ( rescaled by @xmath90 ) of the @xmath56 symmetric and translation invariant gaussian coherent states .",
    "thus we find the classical hamiltonian @xmath91 + \\frac\\lbare{4l^d } \\left(\\bds q_0 ^ 2+\\sum_k\\s_k^2\\right)^2\\ ] ] where by hamilton s equations of motion @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the corresponding conserved energy density @xmath94 may be written @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 is the @xmath4invariant quartic potential regarded as a function of @xmath98 , that is @xmath99 .",
    "it is worth noticing that eq .",
    "( [ elargen ] ) would apply as is to generic @xmath100 .",
    "let us consider first the static aspects embodied in the effective potential @xmath101 , that is the minimum of the potential energy @xmath102 at fixed @xmath103 .",
    "we first define in a precise way the unbroken symmetry phase , in this large @xmath1 context , as the case when @xmath101 has a unique minimum at @xmath104 in the limit of infinite volume . minimizing @xmath102 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath89 yields @xmath105 that is the widths characteristic of a free theory with self  consistent mass @xmath106 fixed by the gap equation . by the assumption of unbroken symmetry , when @xmath104 and at infinite volume @xmath106 coincides with the equilibrium mass @xmath107 of the theory , that may be regarded as independent scale parameter .",
    "since in the limit @xmath43 sums are replaced by integrals @xmath108 we obtain the standard bare mass parameterization @xmath109 and the renormalized gap equation @xmath110_{\\text{finite}}\\ ] ] which implies , when @xmath34 , @xmath111 with a suitable choice of the finite part .",
    "no coupling constant renormalization occurs instead when @xmath112 . the renormalized gap equation ( [ rengapn ] )",
    "may also be written quite concisely @xmath113 in terms of the one ",
    "loop running couplings constant @xmath114^{-1 } \\;,\\quad \\hat\\l(m)=\\l      \\;,\\quad \\hat\\l(2\\lambda\\,e^{-1/2 } ) = \\lbare\\ ] ] it is the landau pole in @xmath115 that actually forbids the limit @xmath32 .",
    "hence we must keep the cutoff finite and smaller than @xmath116 , so that the theory does retain a slight inverse ",
    "power dependence on it . at any rate ,",
    "there exists a very wide window where this dependence is indeed very weak for couplings of order one or less , since @xmath117 .",
    "moreover , we see from eq .",
    "( [ nice ] ) that for @xmath118 much smaller than the landau pole there are two solutions for @xmath106 , one `` physical '' , always larger than @xmath107 and of the same order of @xmath119 , and one `` unphysical '' , close to the landau pole .",
    "one can now easily verify that the effective potential has indeed a unique minimum in @xmath104 , as required .",
    "in fact , if we assign arbitrary @xmath120dependent values to the widths @xmath89 , ( minus ) the effective force reads @xmath121 and reduces to @xmath122 when the widths are extremal as in eq .",
    "( [ massive ] ) ; but @xmath123 is positive for unbroken symmetry and so @xmath104 is the unique minimum .",
    "we define the symmetry as broken whenever the infinite volume @xmath124 has more than one minimum .",
    "of course , as long as @xmath12 is finite , @xmath124 has a unique minimum in @xmath104 , because of the unicity of the ground state in quantum mechanics , as already discussed in section [ nogo ] .",
    "let us therefore proceed more formally and take the limit @xmath43 directly on the potential energy @xmath102 .",
    "it reads @xmath125 where we write for convenience the tree ",
    "level potential @xmath97 in the positive definite form @xmath126 .",
    "@xmath102 is now the sum of two positive definite terms .",
    "suppose there exists a configuration such that @xmath127 and the first term in @xmath102 is at its minimum .",
    "then this is certainly the absolute minimum of @xmath102 .",
    "this configuration indeed exists at infinite volume when @xmath34 : @xmath128\\ ] ] where the nonnegative @xmath74 should be regarded as an independent parameter fixing the scale of the symmetry breaking .",
    "it replaces the mass parameter @xmath107 of the unbroken symmetry case : now the theory is massless in accordance with goldstone theorem . on the contrary , if @xmath112 this configuration is not allowed due to the infrared divergences caused by the massless nature of the width spectrum .",
    "this is just the standard manifestation of mermin  wagner ",
    "coleman theorem that forbids continuous symmetry breaking in a two  dimensional space ",
    "time @xcite .    at finite volumes",
    "we can not minimize the first term in @xmath102 since this requires @xmath8 to diverge , making it impossible to keep @xmath127 .",
    "in fact we know that the unicity of the ground state with finitely many degrees of freedom implies the minimization equations ( [ massive ] ) to hold always true with a @xmath123 strictly positive .",
    "therefore , broken symmetry should manifest itself as the situation in which the equilibrium value of @xmath123 is a positive definite function of @xmath12 which vanishes in the @xmath43 limit .",
    "we can confirm this qualitative conclusion as follows .",
    "we assume that the bare mass has the form given in eq .",
    "( [ minimum ] ) and that @xmath129 too . minimizing",
    "the potential energy leads always to the massive spectrum , eq .",
    "( [ massive ] ) , with the gap equation @xmath130 if @xmath131 does not vanish too fast for large volumes , or stays even finite , then the sum on the modes has a behavior similar to the corresponding infinite volume integral : there is a quadratic divergence that cancels the infinite volume contribution , and a logarithmic one that renormalizes the bare coupling .",
    "the direct computation of the integral would produce a term containing the @xmath132 .",
    "this can be split into @xmath133 $ ] by using @xmath74 as mass scale .",
    "the first term renormalizes the coupling correctly , while the second one vanishes if @xmath123 vanishes in the infinite volume limit .    when @xmath43 , the asymptotic solution of ( [ gapagain ] ) reads @xmath134 that indeed vanishes in the limit .",
    "note also that the exponent is consistent with the assumption made above that @xmath106 vanishes slowly enough to approximate the sum over @xmath85 with an integral with the same @xmath106 .",
    "let us now consider a state whose field expectation value @xmath135 is different from @xmath136 .",
    "if @xmath137 , the minimization equations ( [ massive ] ) leads to a positive squared mass spectrum for the fluctuations , with @xmath123 given self ",
    "consistently by the gap equation . on the contrary ,",
    "as soon as @xmath138 , one immediately see that a positive @xmath123 can not solve the gap equation @xmath139 if we insist on the requirement that @xmath8 not be macroscopic .",
    "in fact , the r.h.s . of the previous equation is negative , no matter which positive value for the effective mass we choose , at least for @xmath12 large enough . but nothing prevent us to consider a static configuration for which the amplitude of the zero mode is macroscopically large ( i.e. it rescales with the volume @xmath140 ) .",
    "actually , if we choose @xmath141 we obtain the same equation as we did before and the same value for the potential , that is the minimum , in the limit @xmath142 .",
    "note that at this level the effective mass @xmath106 needs not to have the same behavior in the @xmath142 limit , but it is free of rescaling with a different power of @xmath12",

    "the initial conditions are chosen in several different ways ( see the appendix for details ) , but correspond to a negative @xmath123 at early times with the initial widths all microscopic , that is at most of order @xmath7 .",
    "this is particularly relevant for the zero  mode width @xmath8 , which is instead macroscopic in the lowest energy state when @xmath163 , as discussed above .",
    "as for the background , the figures are relative to the simplest case @xmath185 , but we have considered also initial conditions with @xmath186 , reproducing the `` dynamical maxwell construction '' observed in ref .",
    "@xcite . at any rate , for the purposes of this work , above all it is important to observe that , due to the quantum back ",
    "reaction , @xmath123 rapidly becomes positive , within the so  called _ spinodal time _",
    "@xcite , and then , for times before @xmath11 , the _ weakly dissipative _ regime takes place where @xmath123 oscillates around zero with amplitude decreasing as @xmath187 and a frequency fixed by the largest spinodal wavevector , in complete agreement with the infinite  volume results @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , after exponential grow until the spinodal time , the width of the zero  mode grows on average linearly with time , reaching a maximum for @xmath188 .",
    "precisely , @xmath8 performs small amplitude oscillations with the same frequency of @xmath123 around a linear function of the form @xmath189 , where @xmath190 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : m0_l ] ) , confirming what already found in refs .",
    "@xcite ; then quite suddenly it turns down and enters long irregular poincar  like cycles . since the spinodal oscillation frequency does not depend appreciably on @xmath12 , the curves of @xmath8 at different values of @xmath12 are practically identical for @xmath191 . after a certain number of complete oscillations , a number that scales linearly with @xmath12 , a small change in the behavior of @xmath123 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : usc_mass ] ) determines an inversion in @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : usc_zm ] ) , evidently because of a phase crossover between the two oscillation patterns . shortly after @xmath11 dissipation practically stops as the oscillations of @xmath123 stop decreasing in amplitude and become more and more irregular , reflecting the same irregularity in the evolution of the widths .",
    "the main consequence of this numerical scenario is that the linear growth of the zero  mode width at infinite volume can not be consistently interpreted as a form of bose ",
    "einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite .",
    "if a macroscopic condensation were really there , the zero mode would develop a @xmath192 function in infinite volume , that would be announced by a width of the zero mode growing to values @xmath193 at any given size @xmath12 .",
    "now , while it is surely true that when we push @xmath12 to infinity , also the time @xmath11 tends to infinity , allowing the zero mode to grow indefinitely , it is also true that , at any fixed though arbitrarily large volume , the zero mode never reaches a width @xmath193 , just because @xmath194 . in other words , if we start from initial conditions where @xmath8 is microscopic , then it never becomes macroscopic later on .",
    "on the other hand , looking at the behavior of the mode functions of momenta @xmath21 for @xmath78 fixed but for different values of @xmath12 , one realizes that they obey a scaling similar to that observed for the zero  mode : they oscillate in time with an amplitude and a period that are @xmath195 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : m1 ] and [ fig : m1_l ] ) .",
    "thus , each mode shows a behavior that is exactly half a way between a macroscopic amplitude [ i.e. @xmath193 ] and a usual microscopic one [ i.e. at most @xmath197 .",
    "this means that the spectrum of the quantum fluctuations at times of the order of the diverging volume can be interpreted as a _ massless _ spectrum of _ interacting _",
    "goldstone modes , because their power spectrum develops in the limit a @xmath198 singularity , rather than the @xmath199 pole typical of free massless modes . as a consequence",
    "the equal  time field correlation function [ see eq .",
    "( [ 2pn ] ) ] will fall off as @xmath200 for large separations smaller only than the diverging elapsed time .",
    "this is in accord with what found in @xcite , where the same conclusion where reached after a study of the correlation function for the scalar field in infinite volume .",
    "the fact that each mode never becomes macroscopic , if it started microscopic , might be regarded as a manifestation of unitarity in the large @xmath1 approximation : an initial gaussian state with only microscopic widths satisfies clustering and clustering can not be spoiled by a unitary time evolution . as a consequence , in the infinite  volume",
    "time dynamics , the zero  mode width @xmath8 does not play any special role and only the behavior of @xmath89 as @xmath201 is relevant .",
    "as already stated above , it turns out from our numerics as well as from refs .",
    "@xcite that this behavior is of a novel type characteristic of the out  of  equilibrium dynamics , with @xmath202 .",
    "the main limitation of the large @xmath1 approximation , as far as the evolution of the widths @xmath89 is concerned , is in its intrinsic gaussian nature .",
    "in fact , one might envisage a scenario in which , while gaussian fluctuations stay microscopic , non  gaussian fluctuations grow in time to a macroscopic size . in this section",
    "we therefore consider a time  dependent hf approximation capable in principle of describing the dynamics of non  gaussian fluctuation of a single scalar field with @xmath2 interaction .",
    "as anticipated in section [ int ] , we examine in this work only states in which the scalar field has a uniform , albeit possibly time ",
    "dependent expectation value . in a tdhf approach",
    "we may then start from a wavefuction of the factorized form ( which would be exact for free fields ) @xmath203 the dependence of @xmath204 on its two arguments can not be assumed to factorize in general since space translations act as @xmath205 rotations on @xmath40 and @xmath206 ( hence in case of translation invariance @xmath204 depends only on @xmath207 ) .",
    "the approximation consists in assuming this form as valid at all times and imposing the stationarity condition on the action @xmath208 with respect to variations of the functions @xmath204 . to enforce a uniform expectation value of @xmath16",
    "we should add a lagrange multiplier term linear in the single modes expectations @xmath209 for @xmath85 .",
    "the multiplier is then fixed at the end to obtain @xmath210 for all @xmath85 .",
    "actually one may verify that this is equivalent to the simpler approach in which @xmath209 is set to vanish for all @xmath85 before any variation .",

    "the last term , where the sum extends to all wavevectors @xmath20 , corresponds instead to the standard mean field replacement @xmath212 .",

    "it should be stressed that in this particular tdhf approximation , beside the mean  field back  reaction term @xmath218 of all other modes on @xmath219 , we keep also the contribution of the _ diagonal _ scattering through the diagonal quartic terms .",
    "in fact this is why @xmath218 has no contribution from the @xmath180mode itself : in a gaussian approximation for the trial wavefunctions @xmath204 the hamiltonians @xmath220 would turn out to be harmonic , the quartic terms being absent in favor of a complete back ",
    "reaction @xmath221 of course the quartic self  interaction of the modes as well as the difference between @xmath181 and @xmath218 are suppressed by a volume effect and could be neglected in the infrared limit , provided all wavefunctions @xmath204 stays concentrated on mode amplitudes @xmath40 of order smaller than @xmath222 .",
    "this is the typical situation when all modes remain microscopic and the volume in the denominators is compensated only through the summation over a number of modes proportional to the volume itself , so that in the limit @xmath43 sums are replaced by integrals @xmath223 indeed we shall apply this picture to all modes with @xmath85 , while we do expect exceptions for the zero  mode wavefunction @xmath224 .",

    "this suggests that , in order to get a finite hamiltonian , we need to introduce in the definition of our model some extra resummation of feynmann diagrams , that is not automatically contained in this self  consistent hf approach .",

    "in fact we have already positively answered this question in the large @xmath1 approach and the hf equations ( [ emotion ] ) do not differ so much to expect the contrary now .",
    "in particular , if we consider the special initial condition @xmath384 , the dynamics of the widths is identical to that in the large @xmath1 approach , apart from the rescaling by a factor of three of the coupling constant .",
    "thus our hf approximation confirms the large @xmath1 approach in the following sense : even if one considers in the variational ansatz the possibility of non  gaussian wavefunctionals , the time evolution from gaussian and microscopic initial conditions is effectively restricted for large volumes to non  macroscopic gaussians .",
    "strictly speaking , however , this might well not be enough , since the infrared fluctuations do grow beyond the microscopic size to become of order @xmath12 .",
    "then the quartic term in the low@xmath385 hamiltonians @xmath220 is of order @xmath12 and therefore it is not negligible by itself in the @xmath43 limit , but only when compared to the quadratic term , which _ for a fixed @xmath219 of order @xmath232 _ would be of order @xmath386 .",
    "but we know that , when @xmath51 , after the spinodal time and before the @xmath11 , the effective squared mass @xmath123 oscillates around zero with amplitude decreasing as @xmath187 and a frequency fixed by the largest spinodal wavevector . in practice it is `` zero on average '' and this reflect itself in the average linear growth of the zero  mode fluctuations and , more generally , in the average harmonic motion of the other widths with non  zero wavevectors .",
    "in particular the modes with small wavevectors of order @xmath387 feel an average harmonic potential with @xmath219 of order @xmath388 .",
    "this completely compensate the amplitude of the mode itself , so that the quadratic term in the low@xmath385 hamiltonians @xmath220 is of order @xmath13 , much smaller than the quartic term that was neglected beforehand in the gaussians approximation .",
    "clearly the approximation itself no longer appear fully justified and a more delicate analysis is required .",
    "we intend to return on this issue in a future work , restricting in the next section our observations on some rather peculiar consequences of the gaussians approximation that provide further evidence for its internal inconsistency .      by definition ,",
    "the gaussian approximation of the effective potential @xmath52 coincides with the infinite  volume limit of the potential energy @xmath389 of eq .",
    "( [ ehf ] ) when the widths are of the @xmath120dependent , energy  minimizing form ( [ inis ] ) with the gap equation for @xmath123 admitting a nonnegative solution .",

    "breaking instead , this agreement holds true only for @xmath390 ; for @xmath391 the gaussian @xmath124 exists but is larger than the hf potential , which is already flat .",

    "its hf counterpart is identical for @xmath390 , while it takes the constant value @xmath397 throughout the internal region @xmath318 . on the other hand",
    "the gaussian @xmath124 can not be defined in the spinodal region @xmath398 , where the gap equation does not admit a nonnegative solution in the physical region far away from the landau pole .",
    "let us first compare this hf situation with that of large @xmath1 .",
    "there the different coupling of the transverse modes , three time smaller than the hf longitudinal coupling , has two main consequences at the static level : the gap equation ( [ nice ] ) does not admit nonnegative solutions for @xmath163 , so that the spinodal region coincides with the region in which the effective potential is flat , and the physical mass vanishes .",
    "the out  of  equilibrium counterpart of this is the dynamical maxwell construction : when the initial conditions are such that @xmath135 has a limit for @xmath399 , all possible asymptotic values exactly span the flatness region ( and the effective mass vanishes in the limit ) . in practice",
    "this means that @xmath400 is not the true dynamical order parameter , whose large time limit coincides with @xmath74 , the equilibrium field expectation value in a pure phase .",
    "rather , one should consider as order parameter the renormalized local ( squared ) width @xmath401 where the last equality follows from the definition itself of the effective mass @xmath106 [ see eq .",

    "let us now examine what happens instead in the dynamics of the hf approximation , where at the static level the spinodal region @xmath398 is smaller than the flatness region @xmath318 .",
    "our ( preliminary ) numerical evidence shows that a dynamical maxwell construction take place as in the large @xmath1 approximation , but it covers only the spinodal region [ see for instance figs .",
    "[ fig : max1 ] and [ fig : max2 ] ] .",
    "if the background @xmath402 starts with zero velocity inside the spinodal interval , then it tends to a limit within the same interval , the asymptotic force vanishing because @xmath403 in the limit [ see eq . ( [ emotion ] ) ] .",
    "hence we find that the order parameter @xmath404 [ the relation ( [ btdgap ] ) was used in the last equality ] tends to @xmath405 not @xmath136 .",
    "it `` stops at the spinodal line '' .",
    "this fact is at the basis of the so  called _ spinodal inflation_@xcite . even without a conspicuous numerical evidence for the full dynamical maxwell construction ,",
    "this results is manifestly true when initially ( and therefore at any time ) @xmath406 , because the equations of motion for the widths are the same as in large @xmath1 and the effective mass only differs by the factor of three in front of the quantum back  reaction @xmath181 . since practically all the back ",
    "reaction takes place during the exponential growth of the unstable spinodal modes , one could say that , in the gaussian hf approximation , this back  reaction is to strong and prevents the quantum fluctuations from sampling the true minima of the classical potential .",
    "a side effect of this is that the effective mass @xmath106 does not tend to its correct equilibrium value @xmath107 as @xmath399 , unlike in the large @xmath1 approach .    in the previous section",
    "we have discussed the possible origin of the problem : in our tdhf approach the initial gaussian wavefunctions are allowed to evolve into non ",
    "gaussian forms , but they simply do not do it in a macroscopic way , within a further harmonic approximation for the evolution , so that in the infinite  volume limit they are indistinguishable from gaussians at all times .",
    "but when @xmath123 is on average not or order @xmath13 , but much less , as it happens for suitable initial conditions , infrared modes of order @xmath12 will be dominated by the quartic term in our schroedinger equations ( [ schroedinger ] ) , showing a possible internal inconsistency of the gaussians approximation .",
    "another interesting point concerns the dynamical maxwell construction itself , within the gaussians approximation .",
    "in fact it is not at all trivial that the effective potential , in any of the approximation previously discussed , does bear relevance on the asymptotic behavior of the infinite  volume system whenever a fixed point is approached .",
    "strictly speaking in fact , even in such a special case the effective potential has little to say on the dynamics , since it is obtained from a static minimization and the energy is not at its minimum at the initial time and is exactly conserved in the evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "if a solution of the equations of motion ( [ emotion ] ) exists in which the background @xmath171 tends to a constant @xmath407 as @xmath399 , one might expect that the effective action ( which however is nonlocal in time ) somehow reduces to a ( infinite ) multiple the effective potential , so that @xmath407 should be an extremal of the effective potential .",
    "this is still an open question that deserve further analytic studies and perhaps some further numerical confirmation .",

    "we have worked in two non  perturbative approximation schemes , namely the large @xmath1 expansion in the leading order and a generalized time dependent hartree  fock approximation .",
    "we have reached two main conclusions .",
    "the first , based on strong numerical evidence , is that the linear growth of the zero  mode quantum fluctuations , observed already in the large @xmath1 approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , can not be consistently interpreted as a new form of bose ",
    "einstein condensation .",
    "in fact , in finite volume , @xmath8 never grows to @xmath193 if it starts from a microscopic value , that is at most of order @xmath7 . on the other hand all long  wavelength fluctuations rapidly become of order @xmath12 , signalling a novel infrared behavior quite different from free massless fields at equilibrium [ recall that the large @xmath1 or hf approximations are of mean field type , with no direct interaction among particle excitations ] .",
    "this is in agreement with the properties of the two  point function determined in @xcite .",
    "the second point concerns the hf approach to the out  of  equilibrium @xmath2 qft .",
    "we have shown that , within a slightly enlarged tdhf approach that allows for non  gaussian wavefunctions , one might recover the usual gaussians hf approximation in a more controlled way , realizing that the growth of long  wavelength fluctuations to order @xmath12 in fact undermines the self  consistency of the gaussians approximation itself .",
    "the first manifestation of this weakness is the curious `` stopping at the spinodal line '' of the width of the gaussian quantum fluctuations .",
    "this does not happen in the large @xmath1 approach because of different coupling of transverse mode ( the only ones that survive in the @xmath6 limit ) with respect to the longitudinal modes of the @xmath164 case in the hf approach .",
    "clearly further study , both analytical and numerical , is needed in our tdhf approach to better understand the dynamical evolution of quantum fluctuations in the broken symmetry phase .",
    "another interesting direction is the investigation , in our hf approximation , of the case of finite @xmath1 , in order to interpolate smoothly the results for @xmath164 to those of the @xmath59 approach .",
    "one first question concerns whether or not the goldstone theorem is respected in the hf approximation @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting also to study the dynamical realization of the goldstone paradigm , namely the asymptotic vanishing of the effective mass in the broken symmetry phases , in different models ; this issue needs further study in the @xmath409 case @xcite , where it is known that the goldstone theorem is not valid .",
    "another open question concerns the connection between the minima of the effective potential and the asymptotic values for the evolution of the background , within the simplest gaussian approximation .",
    "as already pointed out in @xcite , a dynamical maxwell construction occurs for the @xmath56 model in infinite volume and at leading order in @xmath59 in case of broken symmetry , in the sense that any value of the background within the spinodal region can be obtained as large time limit of the evolution starting from suitable initial conditions .",

    "reaction @xmath181 reads , in the notations of this appendix @xmath423 technically it is simpler to treat an equivalent set of equations , which are formally linear and do not contain the singular heisenberg term @xmath424 .",
    "this is done by introducing the complex mode amplitudes @xmath425 , where the phases @xmath426 satisfy @xmath427 .",
    "then we find a discrete version of the equations studied for instance in ref @xcite , @xmath428 z_n=0 \\;,\\quad   \\sigma = \\frac{1}{l^d } \\sum_{n=0}^{{\\cal n}^2 } g_n |z_n| ^2\\ ] ] subject to the wronskian condition @xmath429 one realizes that the heisenberg term in @xmath430 corresponds to the centrifugal potential for the motion in the complex plane of @xmath431 .",
    "let us now come back to the equations ( [ numeq ] ) . to solve these evolution equations",
    ", we have to choose suitable initial conditions respecting the wronskian condition . in case of unbroken symmetry , once we have fixed the value of @xmath16 and its first time derivative at initial time , the most natural way of fixing the initial conditions for the @xmath431 is to require that they minimize the energy at @xmath432 .",
    "we can obviously fix the arbitrary phase in such a way to have a real initial value for the complex mode functions @xmath433 where @xmath434 .",
    "the initial squared effective mass @xmath435 , has to be determined self - consistently , by means of its definition ( [ nunbgap ] ) .    in case of broken symmetry ,",
    "the gap equation is a viable mean for fixing the initial conditions only when @xmath16 lies outside the spinodal region [ cfr .",
    "eq ( [ nicen ] ) ] ; otherwise , the gap equation does not admit a positive solution for the squared effective mass . in that case",
    ", we have to resort to other methods , in order to choose the initial conditions . following the discussion presented in [ ooedn ] , one possible choice is to set @xmath436 for @xmath175 in eq .",
    "( [ newgap ] ) and then solve the corresponding gap equation ( [ newgap ] ) . an other acceptable choice would be to solve the gap equation ( [ newgap ] ) , once we have set a massless spectrum for all the spinodal modes but the zero mode , which is started from an arbitrary , albeit microscopic , value .",
    "there is actually a third possibility , that is in some sense half a way between the unbroken and broken symmetry case .",
    "we could allow for a time dependent bare mass , in such a way to simulate a sort of _ cooling down _ of the system . in order to do that",
    ", we could start with a unbroken symmetry bare potential ( which fixes initial conditions naturally via the gap equation ) and then turn to a broken symmetry one after a short interval of time .",
    "this evolution is achieved by a proper interpolation in time of the two inequivalent parameterizations of the bare mass , eqs .",
    "( [ nm2ren ] ) and ( [ minimum ] ) .      as far as the numerical algorithm is concerned , we used a @xmath437th order runge - kutta algorithm to solve the coupled differential equations ( [ numeq ] ) , performing the computations in boxes of linear size ranging from @xmath438 to @xmath439 and verifying the conservation of the wronskian to order @xmath440 . typically , we have chosen values of @xmath441 corresponding to the uv cutoff @xmath26 equal to small multiples of @xmath107 for unbroken symmetry and of @xmath442 for broken symmetry .",
    "in fact , the dynamics is very weakly sensitive to the presence of the ultraviolet modes , once the proper subtractions are performed .",
    "this is because only the modes inside the unstable ( forbidden or spinodal ) band grow exponentially fast , reaching soon non perturbative amplitudes ( i.e. @xmath443 ) , while the modes lying outside the unstable band remains perturbative , contributing very little to the quantum back ",
    "reaction @xcite and weakly affecting the overall dynamics .",
    "the unique precaution to take is that the initial conditions be such that the unstable band lay well within the cutoff .",
