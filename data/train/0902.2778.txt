    "it is generally believed that the galactic diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) has three major phases to a large extent regulated by supernova explosions ( sne ) : cold / warm neutral , cold / warm ionized , and hot ionized ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the neutral phase , as traced by ly@xmath0 and 21 cm emission of , is mainly concentrated in the galactic plane within a height of no more than several hundred parsec ( pc , e.g. , lockman et al .",
    "the distribution of the diffuse warm ionized gas , which is traced by h@xmath0 emission and pulsar dispersion measures , can be characterized as an exponential decay with a vertical scale height of @xmath6 kpc ( e.g. , berkhuijsen et al .",
    "the hot gas at temperatures of @xmath7 k is presumably sustained by sne and massive stellar winds and is traced by highly ionized absorption lines and soft x - ray background emission .",
    "it can extend vertically as far as several kpc from the galactic plane ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the chemical and physical properties of interstellar media in the various phases carry important information about formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "stars are formed out of the ism , and metals are all produced in stars and released back to the ism through various forms of stellar feedback .",
    "it is believed that massive galaxies like our own are still evolving by accreting intergalactic matter to replenish the fuel for star formation activity .",
    "the accreted material , which is presumably primordial or metal poor , is further altering the composition in the ism phases .",
    "therefore , the similarities and dissimilarities of the chemical abundances between stars and the ism provide us with information about the interplay among the different phases of the ism as well as the star formation and evolution history .",
    "characterizing the spatial distribution of the hot ism in spiral galaxies is also a vital step to distinguish the small scale ( @xmath8 kpc ) disk component from the large scale ( @xmath920 kpc ) halo hot gas ; the latter is presumably a reservoir of the shock - heated in - falling gas during the galaxy formation / evolution and is believed to provide one possible solution to the `` missing baryon '' problem for an individual dark matter halo (   [ sec : halo ] ; e.g. , sommer - larsen 2006 and references therein ; yao et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy can provide a powerful diagnostic of the physical and chemical properties of the multiphase ism , not only because the k - shell transitions of carbon to iron and the l - shell transitions of silicon to iron are accessible in the x - ray band ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but also because the multiphase ism can be probed by a single abundant metal element at different charge states ( e.g. , yao & wang 2006 ; juett et al .",
    "the latter is particularly striking , and can be utilized to infer ionization states and thus thermal properties of the ism without any confusion of the relative abundances between different elements .",
    "x - rays interact with the ism via scattering and absorption . scattered photons by dust grains are detected as a diffuse x - ray halo around the emitting source which carries information of chemical compositions , the size and the spatial distributions of dust grains , as well as the distance of the x - ray source ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although a detailed study of dust scattering is beyond the scope of this work , its importance towards inferring the chemical abundances of the ism has been recognized ( e.g. , juett et al .",
    "x - rays absorbed by the ism imprint absorption lines and/or edges in the x - ray spectrum of the background source ; the ism at different phases produces absorption features for different charge states .",
    "these features can be used to determine the average chemical abundances and ionization states of the responsible elements in the ism .",
    "@xcite first demonstrated the potential of high resolution x - ray spectroscopy for studies of the ism by presenting a prominent oxygen k absorption edge and a marginal narrow atomic oxygen @xmath10 absorption transition at the expected wavelength in a crab spectrum .",
    "however , because of the limited sensitivity of the previous x - ray instruments , _ einstein observatory _ for example , @xmath11 across the wavelength of 746  , the power of the x - ray spectroscopy has not been extensively explored until recently .",
    "the launches of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ opened a new era in the study of the ism via high resolution x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "the diffraction grating instruments aboard these two observatories offer a resolving power of @xmath12 across most of the soft x - ray band , which , for the first time allows us to resolve the absorption features in great detail and enables us to systematically study the multiple phase ism via detections of multiple absorption edges / lines of ions at different ionization states @xcite .",
    "in addition , these high spectral resolution spectrometers , especially the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ; canizares et al .",
    "2005 ) aboard _ chandra _ with a spectral resolution of @xmath13 , have pushed the detections to the systematic uncertainties of atomic databases .",
    "for instance , in a systematic study of the o k absorption structures , @xcite found that the centroid wavelength of the interstellar  1s1p line is @xmath14 m  offset from that predicted from the theoretical calculations .",
    "clearly , accurate measurements of interstellar absorption features , which are supposed to be at the rest frame wavelengths , will provide valuable references for theoretical calculations and laboratory measurements .    in this work ,",
    "we report high - quality detections of multiple absorption lines and edges in a grating spectrum of the low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) cyg  x-2 obtained with the hetgs .",
    "the source is well suited as a background source to study ism absorption .",
    "its galactic coordinates @xmath15 and distance @xmath16 kpc mean that it is located @xmath17 kpc above the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "therefore its pathlength samples a bulk of the galactic disk gas with very little confusion from the central region of the galaxy where the diffuse emission is greatly enhanced .",
    "the radial velocity of its optical companion suggests a systematic velocity about @xmath18 @xcite of the binary system , which is essential for distinguishing any absorptions produced in the circumstellar material of the source from that in the ism (   [ sec : origin ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : atomic ] , we list the atomic data we are referencing and also briefly introduce the absorption line model utilized in this work . in   [ sec : observation ] , we describe the observations , data reduction , line identifications , as well as measure equivalent widths ( ew ) and optical depths of absorption features . in   [ sec : results ] , we determine the ionic column densities and discuss the properties of the ism in the cold / warm (   [ sec : cism ] ) and hot phases (   [ sec : hism ] ) separately .",
    "we then discuss the location of these absorption features (   [ sec : origin ] ) , estimate the systematic uncertainties of their centroid wavelengths (   [ sec : restframe ] ) , explore the mystery of the undetected  k@xmath0 line (   [ sec : oviimis ] ) , compare the chemical abundances in different phases (   [ sec : chemical ] ) , and estimate the contribution of the galactic disk hot gas to the absorption observed toward the extragalactic sources (   [ sec : halo ] ) .",
    "final results are summarized in ",
    "[ sec : sum ] .    throughout this paper , we reference the solar chemical abundances from @xcite , and quote the uncertainty of a single floating parameter at 1@xmath19 significance levels unless otherwise specified .",
    "we also assume that collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ; sutherland & dopita 1993 ) is reached in the hot phase ism .",
    "@xcite and nist are two commonly referenced databases for atomic lines in the x - ray .",
    "however , neither of the two has included the k transitions of the neutral and mildly ionized metal elements like oxygen and neon , from which the interstellar lines have now been commonly observed ( e.g. , juett et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "recently , several groups have calculated and updated these databases ( e.g. , behar & netzer 2002 ; garcia et al .  2005 ) , but the atomic data for some transitions are still missing and/or not available in proper formats ( table  [ tab : lineparameters ] ) . to this regard , we used the flexible atomic code ( fac ; gu 2003 ) to calculate the k transitions of all charge states for oxygen , neon , and magnesium . for he - like ions , we calculated transitions from the @xmath10 to @xmath20 , whereas for h - like ones we calculated up to the @xmath21 .",
    "for all the lines detected or used in this work (   [ sec : observation ] ) , table  [ tab : lineparameters ] lists the basic parameters of the transitions , which include the line centroid wavelength ( @xmath22 ) , transition oscillation strength ( @xmath23 ) , and the natural width ( @xmath24 ; including radiative and auger decay rates ) . for those transitions with a cluster of lines that can not be resolved with the hetgs resolution",
    ", we take a summation of their @xmath23 and average the @xmath22 and the @xmath24 values with respect to the corresponding @xmath23 values . for a comparison",
    ", we also list the parameters from several other references when they are available .",
    "the measured line centroids in this work are also listed in the last column ( table  [ tab : lineparameters ] ) .",
    "it is important to point out that these parameters can also be extracted from xstar @xcite and aped @xcite with some calculations .",

    "furthermore , the consistent measurements of the  column density ( fig .  [ fig : neix ] ) , for example , indicate a lack of ionization variation that could be expected at different source flux levels in a photoionized scenario .",
    "the above arguments suggest that all the absorption features are consistent with an ism in origin , although the circumstellar scenario with some specific geometric effects can not be completely ruled out .",

    "there are two main systematic uncertainties that affect the measurement of the line centroids presented in this work .",
    "the first comes from the instrumental calibrations . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : observation ] , the first step in our data reduction is to determine the zeroth order source position ; any uncertainty of the position will be linearly propagated to the whole wavelength scale .",

    ", we compare the positive and the negative arms in measuring the  k@xmath0 line , the longest wavelength line of our interest ( table  [ tab : linedetection ] ) .",
    "we find that except for the short observation ( obsid 1016 ) in which there is not enough counts near the line , the difference in the other three individual observations is less than 6.6 m .",
    "since we measured the averaged value of the two arms in our final data analysis , we then take the systematic error due to the calibration to be @xmath179 ( @xmath180 ) m .",
    "the other source of the systematic bias is due to the differential rotation of the ism toward the cyg  x-2 sight line .",
    "gas in the galactic disk at different radii is rotating at different velocities around the galactic center ( gc ) in near circular orbits ; gas close to the gc has a shorter period than that further out . for gas at radius @xmath181 and with a rotational velocity @xmath182 moves with respect to the local standard rest frame ( lsr ) at a speed of @xmath183 where @xmath184 and @xmath185 are the radius of the lsr and its rotation velocity , respectively @xcite .",
    "the observed differential velocity is then the integral of all @xmath181s and @xmath182s along the pathlength to cyg  x-2 .",
    "the velocity shift due to the differential rotation is very small . for low ionization ions ,",
    "this effect can be revealed from the 21 cm   emission .",

    "we here assume that , ( 1 ) the density of the hot gas decreases exponentially along the vertical distance away from the galactic plane with a scale height of 3 kpc ( e.g. , bowen et al .",
    "2008 ; yao et al .",
    "2008 ) ; ( 2 ) the rotation velocity linearly decreases from @xmath185 and @xmath182 at the galactic plane to zero at a height @xmath187 above the galactic plane ; and ( 3 ) the velocity at radii between @xmath184 and @xmath181 can be linearly interpolated from @xmath185 and @xmath182 . for the lsr , we take @xmath188 kpc and @xmath189 , and for the galactic radius of cyg  x-2 , @xmath190 kpc .",

    "if assuming a more reasonable @xmath187 = 8 kpc , we then obtain @xmath195 , which corresponds to an uncertainty of 4.4 , 4.1 , and 1.7 m  at wavelength of 23.5 , 22 , and 9  , respectively .",
    "it is worth pointing out that besides the absorption lines presented in this work , the highly ionized emission lines observed in stellar coronae ( e.g. , @xcite ) also provide complementary references for the rest frame wavelengths of the atomic transitions .",
    "the wavelengths measured in this work are remarkably consistent with those detected in stellar coronae .    for transitions of the low ionization ions , the absorption line centroids and the edge wavelengths reported in @xcite , though with larger statistical errors due to the lower counting statistics in their used spectra , are consistent with the values obtained in this work .",
    "in our high quality spectrum , we did not detect the  k@xmath0 absorption line , which however , is expected to be one of the most prominent lines because of the high abundance of oxygen , the high ionization fraction of  in a broad temperature range @xcite , and the large absorption oscillation strength of the transition ( table  [ tab : lineparameters ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : oviika ] exhibits the expected  k@xmath0 absorption based on the measurement of the detected  k@xmath157 and non - detected  k@xmath24 lines ( table  [ tab : linedetection ] ) .",
    "the absence of the  k@xmath0 absorption is puzzling .",
    "one obvious possibility would be that there is an  resonance emission line with a flux compensating for the line absorption .",
    "if this is the case , it requires a line flux of @xmath196 .",
    "emission lines tracing the photoionized accretion - disk - corona ( adc ) have been observed in this source , but the lines are generally very broad with a minimum fwhm of @xmath197 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : oviika ] demonstrates such a local broad emission line at the systematic velocity of cyg  x-2 ( @xmath18 ;   [ sec : intro ] ) on top of the continuum ; its flux is scaled to that of the missing  k@xmath0 at the corresponding wavelength .",
    "although such a line has the power to compensate for the absorption , the slight offset as well as the stark difference in line broadening has to leave a significant residual with respect to the line absorption .",
    "the adc region is also expected to have a very high density , and the intercombination line usually dominates the triplet emission for the he - like ions @xcite .",
    "if it is the intercombination rather than the resonance transition that fills in the absorption , besides its broadening , it is also expected to be blue - shifted at @xmath198 for .",
    "such a velocity shift was not observed in other detected emission lines @xcite .",
    "also , the intercombination line will be slightly broader than the resonance and should leave a similar residual .",
    "the ionization parameters derived from the emission lines are also too high to expect the emission from the oxygen ions @xcite .",
    "another source that could fill the expected  k@xmath0 line absorption is the scattered resonance line emission of the hot ism . but",
    "this diffuse emission presumably uniformly fills the _ chandra _ field of view , and thus would only produce a very broad rather than a narrow emission enhancement in the grating spectrum .",
    "futhermore , the intinsic  intensity of the diffuse ism along the cyg  x-2 sight line is expected to be @xmath199 @xmath200 @xcite , and the foreground cool ism will attenuate this emission to be @xmath201 ( taking @xmath202 ; table  [ tab : hydrogen ] ) before the emission reaches detectors .",
    "the small field of view ( @xmath203 , the full field of view of two acis chips ) of _ chandra _ thus could only yield a line flux of @xmath204 at most , which is much less than the missing amount .",
    "the consistent measurement of the non - detected  k@xmath0 line between positive and negative grating spetral orders also rules out any possible instrumental effects ( e.g. , an unfortunate set of hot pixels or unrecognized non - x - ray events precisely at the position of the absorption line on the detector ) that could fill the absorption line .",
    "the other detected absorption lines do not seem to be significantly diluted by any peculiar line emission .",
    "the putative adc emission is not expected to affect our absorption measurements in general .",
    "the detected ism lines are nearly unresolved (   [ sec : results ] ) , and their measurements rely on the local continuum in a very narrow wavelength range .",
    "the generally very broad emission lines as observed in the cyg  x-2 binary system can therefore be regarded as continuum and thus will not generate any confusion to the measurements presented in this work .",
    "the only concern with respect to our measurements is a likelihood of the similar peculiar narrow emission lines as may possibly occur in the case of  k@xmath0 . for the h- and he - like oxygen and neon ions , the emissivity ratios between the 1s2p and the 1s3p transitions in the temperature range of @xmath205 k are always larger than the ratios of the corresponding absorption oscillation strengths",
    ". therefore any existing emission will fill more rapidly the 1s2p lines than the 1s3p ones .",
    "we re - fit the individual k@xmath0 and k@xmath157 absorption lines of  and , and find that the column densities derived from the different transitions are consistent within 1@xmath19 for each ion .",
    "in contrast , the 1s3p of  provides a very tight constraint on   column density while the 1s2p only yields an upper limit ( table  [ tab : linedetection ] ) .",
    "this consistent measurement in  and  could only be incidentally reached when the filled - up portions of the lines were proportional to their absorption oscillation strengths plus the saturation effects .",
    "we thus speculate that the chance for the existence of the peculiar emission lines for other ions is small .",
    "limited by the scope of this work , we prefer to leave the mystery of the missing  k@xmath0 absorption line unexplained , and assume that other  transitions ( e.g. , k@xmath157 and k@xmath24 ) still faithfully reflect the  absorption column in the following sections .",
    "the chemical abundances of the cool phase ism presented in table  [ tab : abund ] represent so far the best measurements of the absolute abundances in x - ray . for a comparison , table  [ tab : abund ] also lists several references for the solar / ism abundances commonly used in the literature . in these references , neon is the one of the most uncertain abundances because its value is usually scaled with respect to other relatively well - studied ones like oxygen , due to the lack of suitable spectral lines in modeling the sun s photosphere ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in contrast , because the total hydrogen column density of the cool phase along the cyg  x-2 sight line is available , the measured neon value in this work offers a valuable reference for its abundance in the ism .",
    "our measured oxygen abundance is systematically lower than all the referenced values , indicating an oxygen depletion into dust grains ( see below ) , whereas the magnesium value suggests a mild or no depletion ( table  [ tab : abund ] ) .    for the hot phase ism ,",
    "since the hydrogen is expected to be fully ionized at temperatures @xmath160 k , there is no usable atomic transition to measure its column density .",
    "however , assuming that the neon abundance remains the same in both cool and hot phases , we can utilize the established neon abundance in the cool phase to derive the absolute abundances of oxygen , magnesium , and iron in the hot phase based on their measured relative abundances (   [ sec : hism ] ; tables  [ tab : abund ] and [ tab : absline ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the abundance difference between the cool and hot phases ( table  [ tab : abund ] ) .",
    "the oxygen abundance in the hot phase is remarkably lower than the old solar value of @xcite , but is consistent with the recently revised solar value @xcite and the expected value in the ism @xcite .",
    "however , it is apparently higher than that in the cool phase , which indicates dust grain sputtering and/or recent metal enrichment of the hot phase .",
    "if the dust grains were totally destroyed in the hot phase , the difference indicates that @xmath17830% of the total oxygen is likely depleted into dust grains in the cool phase .",
    "the consistent measurement of the magnesium abundance in both phases further confirms that very little or no magnesium is depleted into dust grains .    if @xmath206 ( @xmath207 ) of oxgyen is indeed depleted into dust grains , its 1s2p transition that is analog to that of the atomic form at 23.51 would also imprint a significant absorption feature near the position of the instrumental oxide resonance at 23.35 ",
    "however , visual inspectation does not reveal any absorption line other than the one at 23.35   between 22.81   ( the atomic oxygen edge position ) and 23.51   ( fig .  [ fig : counts ] ) .",
    "several previous works actually attributed the absorption feature at 23.35   to oxygen in compound forms rather than to its atomic  1s2p transition ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , such a attribution would further exacerbate the already deficit of the  column density (   [ sec : cism ] ) .",
    "one possible explanation is that the 1s2p transition of oxygen in dust grains is completely suppressed due to the effectively filled l ( n=2 ) shell and/or that the transition oscillation strength ( @xmath208 ) for oxygen in compound forms is so small ( @xmath209 ) that the absorption feature is too weak to be visible .",

    ", the population of  peaks at intermediate temperatures at which the hot gas cools very efficiently ; a bulk of the observed  is believed to exist at interfaces of the cool and hot gases ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the  thus traces more directly to the embedded cool gas clouds rather than to the hot gas itself .",
    "the smooth distributions of the diffuse soft x - ray emission intensity in our galaxy ( again , except for the known emission enhancement regions like the north polar spur , the galactic center , the cygnus loop , etc . ;",
    "@xcite ) and around the extragalactic disk galaxies @xcite in fact suggest that the galactic disk gas is likely to be homogeneous in general .",
    "we now compare the highly ionized absorption lines between the cyg  x-2 sight line and the extragalactic sight line mrk  421 .",
    "the latter presents to date the best constrained highly ionized absorptions toward extragalactic sight lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) . with respect to the galactic x - ray binary 4u  1957 + 11 ( galactic coordinates @xmath220 ) used in @xcite , cyg  x-2 is located further away from the galactic center region and thus the observed absorption should be less affected by the galactic bulge gas .",
    "we jointly analyze the absorption lines toward these two sources by assuming the common disk hot gas has the same thermal properties .",
    "we normalize the absorption toward the cyg  x-2 sight line to that toward the mrk  421 direction by assuming that the absorbing gas is slab - like distributed ( e.g. , by multiplying a factor of @xmath221 ) , and obtain the `` net '' absorption beyond the cyg  x-2 as @xmath222 , and @xmath223 , i.e. , the pathlength of cyg  x-2 can account for @xmath224 of the total absorption toward mrk  421 sight line . if we further consider the location of cyg  x-2 and assume that its pathlength only samples @xmath225 of the disk hot gas in the vertical direction ( taking its distance of @xmath226 kpc and an exponential scale height of 3 kpc ;   [ sec : intro ] and @xcite ) , we find that all the x - ray absorption toward the mrk  421 can be attributed to the galactic disk hot gas , and obtain upper limits to the `` net '' absorption beyond the disk as @xmath227 and @xmath228 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mrkcyg ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the limits derived by @xcite .",
    "a large amount of far - uv absorption and emission is expected to arise from the observed -bearing gas .",
    "the detected  along the cyg  x-2 sight line ( @xmath229}=15.73^{+0.17}_{-0.13}$ ] ; table  [ tab : linedetection ] ) is the largest  column density observed so far .",
    "if assuming the solar abundance ratios of n / o and c / o , we can estimate the expected  and  column densities ( and thus the corresponding ews of their l transition lines ) associated with the -bearing gas for the isothermal assumption (   [ sec : hism ] ) . unlike the lmc  x-3 sight line toward which the hot -bearing gas can explain all the observed  absorptions @xcite , the hot ( @xmath230 k ) gas toward the cyg  x-2 sight line accounts for only a tiny portion of the observed  (   [ sec : hism ] ) , leaving much of the  to arise from the conductive interfaces ( e.g. , @xcite ) . @xcite recently derived an electron density of @xmath231 at the interfaces by comparing the  emission and absorption along the same sight line .",
    "if taking this density and also assuming the solar abundance ratios , we can estimate the expected , , and  emission line intensities from the interfaces . note that if assuming 55% (   [ sec : hism ] ) of the observed  arise from the interfaces , the adopted electron density yields an -gas size of 34 pc or a filling factor of 4% for  at its peak ionization fraction .",
    "figure  [ fig : intensi ] shows the expected  and  column densities and the predicted intrinsic and attenuated line intensities by taking the reddening @xmath232 @xcite and the extinction from @xcite .",
    "these absorption and emission lines ,  and  in particular , are measurable and thus can be tested with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) and the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) installed on _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) with reasonably long exposures .",
    "we presented a high resolution x - ray spectroscopy study of the multiphase interstellar medium based on four observations of cyg  x-2 with the _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating spectrometer .",
    "our main results and conclusion can be summarized as follows :      \\2 .",
    "we demonstrate that these absorption features trace the various phases of the interstellar medium rather than circumstellar material dynamically associated with the cyg  x-2 system .",
    "the well constrained centroids of the absorption features provide a good reference for the rest frame wavelengths of the corresponding atomic transitions .",
    "comparison between absorption edges and absroption lines of  and  constrains velocity dispersion in cool phase ism to be @xmath233 , and joint analysis of multiple high ionization absorption lines ( - , , and ) yields @xmath234 in hot phase ism to be @xmath235 .",
    "\\4 . complementing the absorption data with  21 cm , h@xmath0 , and co emission data",
    ", we derive absolute abundances of neon , oxygen , and magnesium in the cool phase ism to @xmath236 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , respectively . by jointly analyzing the multiple high ionized absorption lines we also derive the abundances of oxygen and magnesium in the hot phase as @xmath237 and @xmath238 , which are robust against different assumed temperature distributions of the absorbing gas . in the cool phase , while about 30% of the oxygen is depleted into dust grains , there is no evidence for magnesium depletion .",
    "the observed  and  absorptions toward cyg  x-2 can already account for @xmath224 of the high ionization absorptions observed toward the mrk  421 sight line . by considering the location of cyg  x-2 and the spatial distribution of the galactic hot gas ,",
    "this means that all the high ionization absorptions observed toward the extragalactic sight line can be attributed to the extended galactic disk .",
    "a large amount of far - uv absorption and emission is expected to arise from the -bearing gas .",
