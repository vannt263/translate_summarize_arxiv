    "the notion of nonclassicality describes the difference between classical and quantum physics . for the harmonic oscillator",
    ", its formal definition is based on the coherent states @xmath0 , which are the closest analogues to the classical oscillation  @xcite .",
    "any quantum state @xmath1 can be formally written as a statistical mixture of ( classical ) coherent states  @xcite , @xmath2 the function @xmath3 is the so - called glauber sudarshan @xmath4  function .",
    "if it is a classical probability density , the state @xmath1 is a classical mixture of coherent states . in many cases , however , the @xmath4  function is a quasiprobability , violating properties of a probability .",
    "then the state is called nonclassical  @xcite .",
    "in general this definition can not be applied in most practical situations , since the @xmath4  function may have strong singularities .",
    "therefore , several criteria for nonclassicality have been developed , which can be distinguished in two major categories .",
    "first , one can examine the expectation value of a so - called nonclassicality witness @xmath5 for a given quantum state  @xcite . without loss of generality ,",
    "this operator has a nonnegative expectation value for all classical states @xmath6 , @xmath7 conversely , if this inequality is violated for a quantum state @xmath8 , then this state must be a nonclassical one : @xmath9 based on nonclassicality witnesses , one may formulate conditions for matrices of characteristic functions  @xcite , moments  @xcite , or outcome probabilities  @xcite .    on the other hand , one may examine phase - space representations of a quantum state , which play the role of a probability density in some sense . besides the @xmath4 function , the wigner function is frequently used in experiments since it is always regular . for nonclassical states ,",
    "the wigner function may become negative for some points in phase space .",
    "these negativities indicate the nonclassicality of the quantum state . however , nonnegativity of the wigner function does not prove classicality , and negative values of the wigner function are only sufficient for nonclassicality .",
    "the recently developed concept of nonclassicality filters and quasiprobabilities provides a complete characterization of nonclassical effects  @xcite in terms of regular phase - space distributions .    in the present paper",
    "we show that generally applicable nonclassicality witnesses can be constructed from any nonclassicality filter . in sec .",
    "ii , we elaborate the connection to the previously known nonclassicality witnesses and provide an explicit analytical expression of a universal witness .",
    "experimental applications are briefly discussed in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv , the usefulness of our method is illustrated for an example of a quantum state , under conditions when many other tests fail .",
    "let us start from the characteristic function of the @xmath4  function of the state @xmath1 , @xmath10 we choose a function of a complex argument @xmath11 , @xmath12 , satisfying the conditions  @xcite :    1 .",
    "@xmath13 is integrable for all positive @xmath14 .",
    "2 .   @xmath15 has a nonnegative fourier transform .",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 , for all @xmath11 .",
    "then , @xmath15 is a family of nonclassicality filters , parameterized by the real number @xmath14 .",
    "the fourier transform of the filtered characteristic function , @xmath18 is a filtered @xmath4 function of the state .",
    "since the filter is designed for the requirements of nonclassicality tests , @xmath19 is denoted as nonclassicality - filtered @xmath4 function ( nfp ) .",
    "the nfp is nonnegative for all classical states . for all nonclassical states ,",
    "its negativities uncover nonclassicality for properly chosen @xmath14 and @xmath20 .",
    "when the nfps contain the full information about the quantum state , they are called nonclassicality quasiprobabilities  @xcite . their experimental reconstruction has been demonstrated  @xcite . in the following",
    "we renounce this additional constraint and consider general nfps .      in the following , we rewrite the nfp as the expectation value of an hermitian operator with finite trace .",
    "for this purpose , we insert eq .",
    "( [ eq : def : phi ] ) into the definition of the nfp  ( [ eq : def : p : omega ] ) and obtain @xmath21 with the operator @xmath22 the complex argument @xmath20 plays the role of a coherent displacement of the operator @xmath23 , it can be expressed with the unitary displacement operator @xmath24 by @xmath25 let us consider the operator @xmath26 first .",
    "because @xmath15 has a real fourier transform , we have @xmath27 , which implies that @xmath26 is hermitian .",
    "furthermore , the expectation value for any coherent state is given by the fourier transform of @xmath15 , @xmath28 which is nonnegative by definition of a nonclassicality filter . in consequence ,",
    "the same holds not only for coherent states , but for all classical states .",
    "last , @xmath29 is a trace class operator , since @xmath30 and @xmath16 : @xmath31 since the coherent displacement does not affect these properties , we conclude that @xmath32 has the same features for all  @xmath20 .",
    "this gives rise to the interpretation of the hermitian operator @xmath29 as a _",
    "nonclassicality witness _ : its expectation value is nonnegative for all classical states .",
    "hence , states with negative expectation values are clearly identified as being nonclassical . in this sense",
    ", we have proved that any nonclassicality filter @xmath15 can be used to define a nonclassical witness @xmath29 by eq .",
    "( [ eq : def : witness ] ) .",
    "its expectation value is the nfp @xmath19 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : link : p_omega : and : witness ] ) . finally , by adapting the results in  @xcite , we know that for any nonclassical state and any nonclassicality witness @xmath29 as defined above , there exists a real width parameter @xmath14 and a complex number @xmath20 such that the expectation value of @xmath29 is negative .",
    "therefore , we constructed a set of nonclassicality witnesses , parameterized by only three real numbers , which is sufficient for the detection of nonclassicality of an arbitrary quantum state . in this sense ,",
    "any witness constructed in this way is universal .    in order to demonstrate the equivalence of witnesses and filters",
    ", we still have to show the converse statement : whenever one has a nonclassicality witness @xmath5 with @xmath33 , as will be assumed in the following , one may construct a nonclassicality filter from it . for this purpose ,",
    "let us represent the witness @xmath5 by its characteristic function @xmath34 of the @xmath35 function  @xcite , @xmath36 now , one easily sees from eq .   that the characteristic function can be directly connected to a nonclassicality filter : @xmath37 and the corresponding nfp is given by eq .  .",
    "because of its bounded trace , the expectation value of @xmath5 is always finite .",
    "hence the nfp is always a regular function , and may be accessible to experiments .",
    "still , the width parameter @xmath14 is not implemented , since the right hand side of  eq .",
    "does not depend on a real parameter @xmath14 .",
    "however , in appendix a we show how this can be achieved .",
    "let us consider the nonnegativity of the fourier transform of the filter @xmath15 more in detail .",
    "this condition can by written with the help of eq .",
    "as @xmath38 with some suitable function @xmath39 . here , we write the arguments @xmath20 and @xmath40 explicitly in order to have a clear notation of corresponding operators which will be defined below .",
    "the nonclassicality filter is the autocorrelation function @xmath41 of the fourier transform of @xmath39 , @xmath42 note that @xmath16 sets a normalization condition on @xmath39 .",
    "however , it is not needed for nonclassicality tests , but only for the correct normalization of quasiprobabilities .",
    "furthermore , since we consider @xmath43 , the width parameter enters into @xmath44 as @xmath45 most importantly , @xmath46 has to be chosen such that the function @xmath15 still fulfills condition c1 .",
    "it has been shown to be sufficient that @xmath47 itself fulfils this requirement  @xcite , i.e.  @xmath48 is integrable for all @xmath14 .    from eq .",
    ", we easily find the normally - ordered form of the nonclassicality witness @xmath26 .",
    "it is obtained by replacing the c - numbers @xmath49 by the operators @xmath50 : @xmath51 the notation @xmath52 indicates that all products of the operators @xmath53 have to be written in normal order .",
    "furthermore , by defining the displaced operator @xmath54 the relation   leads us to @xmath55 this is a remarkable result .",
    "first , we can construct nonclassicality witnesses easily by properly choosing the function @xmath39 .",
    "it has to satisfy some weak conditions , in particular its fourier transform obeys the condition c1 .",
    "the other two conditions are then trivially satisfied by construction .",
    "second , it states that any nonclassicality witness , which can be constructed by a nonclassicality filter , can be written in such a form .",
    "the operator @xmath56 can be found from eqs .",
    ", , , and only depends on three real parameters . as already discussed , one particular operator @xmath56 , equipped with these three parameters , is sufficient to completely determine nonclassicality of an arbitrary state .",
    "here we consider a witness that can be given explicitly .",
    "we fix @xmath57 by choosing its fourier transform as the disc function @xmath58 the corresponding nonclassicality filter does not preserve all information about a quantum state , since it has bounded support .",
    "furthermore , it is not appropriately normalized .",
    "however , it is suitable for the construction of a universal set of nonclassicality witnesses .    from the inverse relation of   and eqs .",
    ", , , we find the nonclassicality witness : @xmath59 ^ 2}{4(\\hat a^\\dagger-\\alpha^*)(\\hat a-\\alpha ) } : , \\label{witn - expl}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the bessel function of first order .",
    "equation   represents a complete family of witness operators in a closed analytic form , which is an important finding of our paper .",
    "it is suited to identify all the nonclassical effects of any quantum state of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "this expression is well - defined in general .",
    "it can be expanded into a normally ordered power series of the displaced photon number operator @xmath61 , @xmath62 ^ 2}\\binom{2m+2}{m } : \\hat n(\\alpha)^m\\!:.\\label{eq : triangular : witness}\\ ] ] it is noteworthy that this form of the witness is not unique .",
    "as we have shown , different witnesses can be constructed from different nonclassicality filters , defined by different functions @xmath63 .",
    "all these witnesses are equivalent for the task to uncover nonclassical effects completely .",
    "nonclassicality witnesses of a form similar to   have already been examined in  @xcite .",
    "they have been constructed as normally ordered squares of some operator @xmath64 , @xmath65 using the @xmath4 function , its expectation value is given by @xmath66 clearly , negative expectation values can only be achieved by negativities of the @xmath4 function , i.e.  by nonclassical states .",
    "simple examples lead to well known nonclassicality conditions .",
    "choosing @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the quadrature operator , we may identify squeezing  @xcite . for @xmath69 , @xmath70 , we uncover sub - poissonian photon number statistics  @xcite .",
    "more general nonclassicality tests can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : witness : f2 ] ) .",
    "one may derive a complete hierarchy of conditions in terms of characteristic functions  @xcite , which directly follows via fourier representation of the operator @xmath71 , cf .  @xcite . via taylor",
    "series expansion of @xmath71 one obtains criteria in terms of matrices of moments  @xcite .",
    "the former method can be applied to any quantum state . in general , however , such a nonclassicality test may become rather complex .",
    "the latter method is only applicable provided that the needed moments exist .",
    "it also becomes complex , in particular if large matrices are needed to detect the nonclassical effects .",
    "if all moments of a quantum state exist , the test operators @xmath72 can be restricted to polynomials in @xmath50  @xcite , which , however , still form an infinite dimensional space .",
    "in contrast , our approach is much simpler , since it requires only control of three real parameters , in order to perform complete nonclassicality tests .",
    "they enter into the operator @xmath56 simply as a displacement and rescaling . on the other hand , our method does not rely on the assumption that all moments of the quantum state exist .",
    "this is due to the requirement c1 for the nonclassicality filter , which guarantees the existence of the quasiprobabilities and expectation values of the witnesses .",
    "remarkably , this condition is much more fundamental as it might look at first sight .",
    "it is also necessary for a complete test of nonclassicality of states , for which _ all _ moments exist .",
    "for instance , if we choose @xmath73 , it has the same structure as our @xmath56 in eq .  , but can not be used to construct a nonclassicality filter which fulfils the condition c1 . as a witness , with @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : witness : f2 ] ) , it requires the existence of the first and second moments of @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "however , this does not provide a nonclassicality test , even for a single quantum state !",
    "from eq .  ( [ eq : link : p_omega : and : witness ] ) , it is clear that one may calculate the expectation value of the witness @xmath29 by reconstruction of the nfp @xmath19 , analogously to the work in  @xcite .",
    "however , this procedure requires full quantum tomography of the state .",
    "the question arises if one can estimate the expectation value directly .",
    "let us restrict to the case of phase - independent nonclassicality filters , i.e.  @xmath77 .",
    "the resulting nonclassicality witness @xmath26 is diagonal in photon number basis , cf .",
    "e.g. eq .  ( [ eq : triangular : witness ] ) .",
    "its expectation value can be written as @xmath78 with @xmath79 being the photon number statistics of the quantum state . since the latter can be measured by photon - number resolving detectors  @xcite , and the matrix elements of @xmath26",
    "can be calculated theoretically for arbitrary @xmath14 , one can determine this expectation value with standard experimental techniques .",
    "of course , practically one is restricted to a finite number of photons , approximating the series in eq .   by a finite sum .",
    "the smaller the width parameter , the better the approximation will be , since the matrix elements @xmath80 are polynomials in @xmath81 , cf .",
    "eq .  . for larger @xmath14  parameter",
    ", a larger number of photons must be resolved , which can be difficult in practice .",
    "this problem is similar to the practical limitation of the @xmath14  parameter as discussed in the context of nonclassicality quasiprobabilities  @xcite . in such cases",
    "one may estimate a systematic error due to the truncation of the series  . in order to measure the expectation value of @xmath29",
    ", we still have to include the coherent displacement in eq .  .",
    "for this purpose , it is indifferent if we displace the witness operator by the amplitude @xmath20 or the quantum state by the amplitude @xmath82 , @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this can be done by methods considered in  @xcite : a highly transparent beamsplitter is used to displace the original state by a coherent one and a photon - number resolving detector measures the signal , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bs ] .",
    "then , the expectation value of the phase - independent nonclassicality witness @xmath26 is determined for the displaced state , which equals to the expectation value of @xmath29 for the original state . in this way",
    ", one can choose @xmath20 by the experimental setup , while the width parameter is included in the fock matrix elements of @xmath26 .",
    "the variation of these three real parameters enables one to perform a complete nonclassicality test for an arbitrary quantum state .",
    "note that the practical determination of @xmath86 can also be based on direct sampling of the photon number statistics from phase - randomized quadrature measurements , as done in  @xcite .",
    "let us consider a single photon added thermal state ( spats )  @xcite , characterized by the mean photon number of the thermal background , @xmath87 , and a quantum efficiency @xmath88 .",
    "it is known that for @xmath89 , this state does exhibit neither squeezing nor sub - poissonian statistics , arising from eq .",
    "( [ eq : witness : f2 ] ) with @xmath67 and @xmath69 respectively  @xcite . furthermore , for @xmath90 , the characteristic function does not show nonclassicality of first order  @xcite . therefore ,",
    "these well - known nonclassicality witnesses are not able to verify nonclassicality of this particular state .",
    "it is also important that for @xmath91 , the wigner function is positive semidefinite  @xcite .",
    "hence , by setting the quantum efficiency @xmath92 and choosing @xmath89 , it is a nontrivial task to witness the nonclassicality of the state under study .    for our examinations ,",
    "we choose the nonclassicality filter given in eq .  .",
    "since spats are phase symmetric and similar to the photon , we may test the witness at the origin of phase space , i.e.  @xmath93 .",
    "figure  [ fig : p : omega:0 ] shows the dependence of the expectation value of the nonclassicality witness @xmath94 on the filter width @xmath14 for states with different mean thermal photon number @xmath87 .",
    "it is clearly seen that for sufficiently large @xmath14 , nonclassicality of all states is verified by negativity of the expectation value of the witness . the lower the mean thermal photon number , i.e.  the closer the state is to the photon , the more pronounced is the effect .",
    "on the filter width , for spatss of different mean thermal photon number @xmath87 and quantum efficiency @xmath95 .",
    "nonclassicality is indicated by negative expectation values , which appear for sufficiently large @xmath14 for all states . ]",
    "we provide universal nonclassicality witnesses , which identify the quantum effects of any quantum state of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "our witness operators are controlled by only three real parameters , compared to the dependence of previously known witnesses on an infinite number of parameters .",
    "the detection of a witness requires a controlled coherent displacement of the quantum state and the determination of the photon number statistics .",
    "we demonstrate the witnessing of a photon on a thermal background , which works very well even when other methods fail .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft through sfb 652 .",
    "in the main article , we have already shown that any nonclassicality witness @xmath5 with @xmath33 can be used to define a nonclassicality filter @xmath96 . here , we construct a complete family of nonclassicality filters @xmath15 , which can be used for a complete nonclassicality test . in order to do so",
    ", we have to find a filter , equipped with a parameter @xmath14 , and with the following requirements :      we have already seen that @xmath34 fulfills two conditions for a nonclassicality filter : the corresponding nfp is always finite for all @xmath20 , as we required by condition c1 , and its negativities clearly indicate nonclassical effects , see condition  c2 .    the task is to introduce a width parameter @xmath14 to the function @xmath34 , such that the constructed family of functions satisfies all properties of a nonclassicality filter . for this purpose , we need an additional nonclassicality filter @xmath99 , which can be constructed by an autocorrelation function as proposed in  @xcite .",
    "now , we look for suitable functions @xmath100 such that @xmath101 is a nonclassicality filter and @xmath98 .    the function @xmath102 shall be a weight function , i.e.  @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath97 , we want to return to the original nonclassicality witness , cf .",
    "condition ( b ) .",
    "this requires @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath106 is an appropriate choice .    in order to have a nonnegative fourier transform of @xmath15 ,",
    "it is sufficient that each summand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : construct : filter : from : w ] ) has this property .",
    "since @xmath99 is a nonclassicality filter itself , the statement is clear for the second term .",
    "furthermore , the fourier transform of @xmath34 is nonnegative , since @xmath107 equals to the expectation value of the nonclassicality witness for the classical coherent states .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient that the remaining factor @xmath108 has a nonnegative fourier transform , which can be achieved by requiring @xmath109 .",
    "last , we require that @xmath13 is integrable for any real @xmath110 , see condition c1 . while the second term in eq .",
    "fulfills this condition by its definition , the first term has to be examined more carefully .",
    "we already know that @xmath111 is integrable , since @xmath34 fulfills condition c1 .",
    "therefore , we split the term as follows : @xmath112 e^{(1-g({{\\rm{\\textit w}}})-1/{{\\rm{\\textit w}}}^2 ) |\\beta|^2/2}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the factor in square brackets is integrable , the remaining factor must be bounded by one , which means @xmath113 .",
    "altogether , the function @xmath114 is a good choice , such that @xmath15 defines a nonclassicality filter .",
    "this concludes our construction .",
