    "a wide set of cosmological observations suggests that the dynamics of the universe are currently dominated by some form of ` dark energy ' , which in standard friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models is propelling an acceleration in late - time cosmic expansion .",
    "however , the physical nature of dark energy is not yet understood , and its effects are subject to intense observational scrutiny .",
    "efforts in this area to date have focused on mapping out the cosmic expansion history using baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) as a standard ruler ( e.g.  beutler et al .",

    "2012 , betoule et al .",
    "these probes have yielded important constraints on the ` homogeneous expanding universe ' , including @xmath11 distance measurements and a @xmath12 determination of the value of the equation - of - state of dark energy , @xmath13 .",
    "however , measurements of the laws of gravity that describe the ` clumpy universe ' are currently less advanced , and only a combination of complementary observations of expansion and gravitational growth will discriminate between the different possible physical manifestations of dark energy .",
    "efforts have focused on establishing whether the laws of general relativity ( gr ) , well - tested on solar - system scales , are a good description of gravity on cosmological scales 14 orders of magnitude larger .",
    "there are two particularly important observable signatures of gravitational physics that can be used for this purpose , and these two methods gain considerable leverage when combined .",
    "the first observable is the peculiar motions of galaxies as they fall toward overdense regions as non - relativistic test particles .",
    "these motions produce correlated doppler shifts in galaxy redshifts that create an overall clustering anisotropy as a function of the angle to the line - of - sight , known as redshift - space distortion ( rsd ) .",
    "this pattern has been measured by a number of galaxy redshift surveys ( e.g.  blake et al .",
    "2011a , beutler et al .",
    "2012 , de la torre et al .",

    "2016 ) and has permitted the growth rate of cosmic structure to be measured with @xmath14 accuracy at some epochs . the second gravitational probe is the patterns of weak lensing imprinted by the deflections of light rays from distant galaxies as they travel through the intervening large - scale structure as relativistic test particles .",
    "this signal may be measured using correlations in the apparent shapes of background galaxies in deep imaging surveys ( e.g.  heymans et al .",

    "whilst the cosmological parameter constraints possible from gravitational lensing statistics are still improving , the measurement offers several key advantages such as its insensitivity to galaxy bias .",
    "velocities and lensing are complementary because only their combination allows general deviations to the einstein field equations to be constrained ( zhang et al .  2007 , song et al .",
    "modern theories of gravity may be classified by the manner in which they warp or perturb the spacetime metric ( and the way this warping is generated by matter ) .",
    "in general two types of perturbations are possible : spacelike and timelike . in gr",
    "these perturbations are equal and opposite , but in ` modified gravity ' scenarios a difference is predicted .",
    "examples of such frameworks include generalizing the ` action ' of gr as a function of the ricci curvature , such as in @xmath15 gravity models ( sotiriou & faraoni 2010 ) , or embedding ordinary 3 + 1 dimensional space into a higher - dimensional manifold such as ` cascading gravity ' ( de rham et al .  2008 ) or ` galileon gravity ' ( chow & khoury 2009 ) .",
    "these scenarios make different observable predictions .",
    "joint cosmological fits to weak gravitational lensing and galaxy redshift - space distortion statistics can be performed using datasets without sky overlap ( e.g.  simpson et al .",
    "however , the availablity of overlapping imaging and spectroscopic surveys yields several scientific benefits .",
    "first , since the same density fluctuations source both the lensing and galaxy velocity signals , the partially - shared sample variance reduces the uncertainty in the gravity fits ( mcdonald & seljak 2009 ) , and the addition of the shape - density correlation statistics ( ` galaxy - galaxy lensing ' ) enables new measurements to be constructed such as the ` gravitational slip ' ( zhang et al .  2007 ) . a series of authors ( gaztanaga et al .  2012 ;",
    "cai & bernstein 2012 ; de putter , dore & das 2014 ; kirk et al .",
    "2015 ; eriksen & gaztanaga 2015 ) have predicted statistical improvements resulting from overlapping surveys , although the degree of this improvement depends on assumptions and survey configuration ( font - ribera et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the actual benefit of overlapping surveys exceeds statistical forecasts because weak lensing measurements are limited by a number of sources of systematic error which may be mitigated using same - sky spectroscopic - redshift observations .",
    "one of the most significant systematic errors is the calibration of the source photometric redshifts which are required for cosmic shear tomography ( ma , hu & huterer 2006 ) .",
    "overlapping spectroscopic surveys are a powerful means of performing this calibration ( newman et al .",
    "2015 ) , using approaches including both observation of complete spectroscopic sub - samples and analysis of cross - correlation statistics ( mcquinn & white 2013 , de putter , dore & das 2014 ) .",
    "conversely , the gravitational lensing imprint allows independent calibration of the galaxy bias parameters that are a key systematic limitation to redshift - space distortion analysis ( e.g.  buddendiek et al .",
    "finally , overlapping imaging and spectroscopy enables a wide range of other science including studies of galaxy clusters , strong lensing systems and galaxy evolution .",
    "the first wide - area overlapping spectroscopic and cosmic shear surveys only recently became available and currently span a shared area of @xmath16 deg@xmath3 , consisting of an overlap between two lensing imaging surveys  the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ; gwyn 2012 , heymans et al .",

    "approximately 500 deg@xmath3 of the kids ngc survey region is already covered by deep spectroscopic data provided by the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; dawson et al .",
    "the remaining kids area lacks deep , wide - area spectroscopic coverage , although two shallower redshift surveys have performed overlapping observations : the galaxy and mass assembly survey ( gama ; driver et al .",

    "the selection function of a galaxy redshift survey describes the variation in the expected mean number density of galaxies , at 3d co - moving co - ordinate @xmath26 , in the absence of clustering .",
    "an accurate determination of the selection function is essential for estimating the galaxy clustering statistics , which quantify fluctuations relative to the mean density .",
    "our model for the selection function of the 2dflens lrg samples considers angular fluctuations in the density of the parent target catalogue on the sky , the variation of the spectroscopic redshift completeness of each aaomega pointing with observing conditions , and the redshift distribution of each target class together with its coupling to the completeness .",
    "we derived selection functions and performed clustering measurements for two survey regions whose coverage is illustrated in figure [ figprogress ] : kids - south ( kids - s ) and kids - north ( kids - n ) .",
    "the kids - s analysis region is delineated by the boundaries listed in table [ tabregions ] , and the kids - n region includes both the stripe of 2dflens pointings in the ngc area visible in figure [ figprogress ] and the rcs1111 region , but excludes cfhtls w1 .        as described in section [ secphotsys ] , field - to - field variations in the photometric accuracy of our atlas data reductions , of the order @xmath27 magnitudes , imprint significant systematic fluctuations in the number of selected lrg targets .",
    "the situation is illustrated by figure [ figntarsys ] , which displays the variation in the 1 deg fields of the number density of the three 2dflens lrg samples in the kids - s region .",
    "if left uncorrected , these fluctuations would cause significant systematic errors in the measured clustering .",
    "similar effects are observed in the kids - n region .    in order to mitigate this effect we adopted a conservative approach to the clustering analysis in which we marginalized over the unknown mean ( unclustered ) number density in each field , constrained by the observed number . for each clustering statistic",
    "we generated an ensemble of measurements corresponding to different angular selection functions .",
    "each realization of the selection function was produced by sampling the density @xmath28 in each atlas field from a probability distribution determined by the observed number of targets @xmath29 in that field .",
    "assuming poisson statistics the probability distribution is given by @xmath30 for large @xmath29 , this distribution is approximated by a gaussian with mean and variance equal to @xmath29 .",
    "we further increased the variance of @xmath31 by adding in quadrature the contribution from angular clustering .",
    "the variance of galaxy counts - in - cells can be related to an integral of the galaxy angular correlation function @xmath32 over the cell area @xmath33 through @xmath34 we used the moments of boss galaxy counts in 1 deg@xmath3 cells to calibrate the final fraction in equation [ eqcountcell ] , which has the value @xmath35 , although varying this value does not significantly affect our results .",
    "the clustering contribution agrees with that calculated from our own final @xmath32 measurements ( using equations 1 and 2 in blake & wall 2002 ) .    with this ensemble of selection functions and",
    "derived clustering measurements in place , we used their mean as our final determination of each statistic , and added their covariance as a systematic error contribution .",
    "this process is illustrated by figure [ figxisys ] for the case of the 2-point correlation function @xmath36 in the kids - s region .",
    "measurements assuming a uniform selection function , neglecting the systematic variations apparent in figure [ figntarsys ] , contain systematic error on large scales , which may be corrected using the observed number density distribution as the angular selection .",
    "marginalizing over the unknown mean density in each field produces an ensemble of clustering measurements whose variation defines a systematic error contribution .",
    "_ importantly , we note that the magnitude of this systematic error is significantly less than the statistical error  by typically an order of magnitude  for all the clustering measurements considered in this paper . _ therefore , whilst we always perform this marginalization process , it does not have a significant impact on our results .",
    "lrg targets were uniquely assigned to the closest aat field centre in our pointing grid , producing a set of hexagonal survey sectors .",
    "we modelled the variation in the angular selection function due to incompleteness in redshift determination using the ratio of good - quality redshifts to targets within each of these sectors .",
    "these redshift completeness maps are displayed in figure [ figredcompang ] for the low-@xmath21 , mid-@xmath21 and high-@xmath21 lrg samples within the kids - s and kids - n survey regions .",
    "the low-@xmath21 lrg follow - up is highly complete , but the mid-@xmath21 and high-@xmath21 samples are imprinted with significant completeness variations driven by aat observing conditions .",
    "we neglected any variation in the redshift completeness across the 2-degree field - of - view ( which may be imprinted by either rotational mis - alignments in acquistion or enhanced chromatic aberrations towards the edges of the field ) .",
    "this variation was lower than @xmath14 for 2dflens observations .",
    "we determined the redshift dependence of the selection function by fitting parametric models ( using chebyshev polynomials ) to the empirical redshift distributions @xmath37 of each lrg sample .",
    "we determined the order of the polynomial via a combination of information criteria considerations and visual inspection .",
    "our model included the coupling between @xmath37 and the angular redshift completeness , such that our selection function is not separable into angular and radial pieces .",
    "this coupling arises because in poorer observing conditions , corresponding to areas of lower total redshift completeness , successful redshifts are preferentially obtained for sources with brighter magnitudes ( see figure [ figredcompmag ] ) , which are preferentially located at lower redshifts . in detail , we fitted @xmath37 functions for lrg samples in bands of apparent magnitude , and constructed the model @xmath37 within each survey pointing using the magnitude distribution of galaxies with successful redshifts within that pointing .",
    "figure [ fignzmag ] shows example @xmath37 fits for the mid-@xmath21 lrg sample .",
    "the low-@xmath21 , mid-@xmath21 and high-@xmath21 2dflens lrg samples overlap in redshift , as illustrated by figure [ fignztype ] .",
    "we combined the lrg samples into two independent redshift bins : @xmath7 and @xmath8 , weighting the selection function of each sample by the relative target numbers .",
    "the choice of these bins was motivated by intended comparisons and combinations with the lowz and cmass samples of boss ( dawson et al .",
    "2013 ) , for example , to extend the analysis of @xmath38 presented by blake et al .",
    "( 2016 ) in these redshift bins .",
    "clustering measurements for 2dflens lrgs in these two redshift bins will be presented in section [ secclus ] .",
    "we computed the effective redshift of the selection functions in each redshift bin as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mean galaxy number density in each grid cell @xmath26 and @xmath41 is the characteristic galaxy power spectrum amplitude , which we evaluated at a scale @xmath42 mpc@xmath43 using the fiducial matter power spectrum and galaxy bias factors specified in section [ secclus ] .",
    "we obtained effective redshifts @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the two bins @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the minimum separation of the optical fibres of the 2df spectrograph is 30 arcsec , and there is a diminishing probability of observing in a single pointing both members of a close pair of parent galaxies separated by an angular distance of less than 2 arcmin .",
    "this deficit of close angular pairs in the redshift catalogue , known as ` fibre collisions ' , artificially suppresses the measured galaxy correlation function on small scales .",
    "we assess the deficit of close angular pairs in figure [ figfibcol ] by plotting the ratio @xmath46 as a function of angular separation @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the angular correlation functions of the redshift and parent catalogues , respectively .",
    "we measured the angular correlation functions by applying the landy - szalay estimator ( landy & szalay 1993 ) to the positions of the data sources @xmath50 and a catalogue of random sources @xmath51 which sample the survey selection function : @xmath52 significant effects are only detectable at the very smallest scales @xmath53 arcmin , and we do not correct for them in our analysis .",
    "we determined the covariance of our 2dflens clustering statistics , and their joint covariance with overlapping measurements of galaxy - galaxy lensing and cosmic shear , using a set of mock catalogues created from a large suite of n - body simulations which included a self - consistent computation of gravitational lensing .",

    "the gravitational lensing shear and convergence is computed at these multiple lens planes using the flat - sky born approximation , and a survey cone spanning 60 deg@xmath3 is constructed by pasting together these snapshots . in this process , the planes were randomly shifted and the direction of the collapsed dimension was changed in order to minimize residual correlations ( see harnois - deraps & van waerbeke 2015 for a complete description of the light cone construction ) .",
    "a spherical over - density halo finder was executed on the particle data during the simulation run , producing dark matter halo catalogues containing properties such as the mass , position , center - of - mass velocity and 3-dimensional velocity dispersion .",
    "these were then post - processed in order to select only those that belonged to the light - cone geometry , self - consistently reproducing the rotation and random shift imposed on the lens planes .",
