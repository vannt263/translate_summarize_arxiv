    "recently there has been considerable progress in using the ads / cft correspondence to understand quantum gravity , especially in the form of explicit mappings from certain cft s to their dual semi - classical geometries .",
    "the first such system was the set of llm geometries : an explicit map from states of @xmath0-bps sector of @xmath1 su(@xmath2 ) sym to their dual supergravity solutions @xcite .",
    "this map was further developed and analysed among others in @xcite .",
    "progress in extending this mapping to the @xmath3- and @xmath4-bps sectors has been made in @xcite .",
    "another such map was proposed between the @xmath0-bps sectors of the d1-d5 black hole and its dual field theory in @xcite , and also in @xcite ; while similar mappings were introduced and analysed for the set of lin  maldacena geometries in @xcite .",
    "all of these mappings lend support to the proposal that gravity is thermodynamic in nature .    in all cases",
    "the supergravity analyses were formulated in terms of classical solutions , but any such mapping must also extend to the quantum level .",
    "such an extension for the llm system was proposed in @xcite , and in this note we apply the methods developed in that paper to the d1-d5 system .",
    "we propose a ` metric ' operator in the cft : an operator whose eigenstates are dual to semi - classical geometries via the mapping given in @xcite .",
    "the states that fail to be eigenstates , however , can not be mapped to spacetimes with unique metrics .",
    "we also analyse how the data characterising the field theory state shows up in the asymptotic form of the spacetime metric .",
    "we find the data to be arranged into a set of multipoles , the first of which was already considered in @xcite as the dipole operator .",
    "we also find that certain terms in the metric only show up if the cft dual state is a superposition of basis states , and demonstrate the measurability of these interference effects .",
    "both of these results are highly analogous to what was found for the llm geometries in @xcite .    finally , we point out that the thermal ensemble , consisting of a sum over all states with the total twist @xmath2 fixed using a lagrange multiplier @xmath5 , is not an eigenstate of the metric operator due to the large fluctuations inherent in the ensemble .",
    "this is again highly analogous to what was found for the llm case in @xcite , but we show that the method used there to restrict the ensemble is incapable of sufficiently constraining the ensemble in the d1-d5 case .    the paper is structured as follows . in section [ review ]",
    "we present a brief review of the d1-d5 system and the map proposed in @xcite . in section [ sec : asymp1 ] we construct the asymptotic expansion of the metric and find a set of multipoles . in section [ metop ]",

    "unfortunately , in our case this method fails to sufficiently stabilize the ensemble , though we feel it is still interesting to present the analysis and investigate why this is so .",
    "thus we begin by fixing @xmath161 so that the the density matrix reduces to @xmath162 using this density matrix it is clear that the first @xmath64 excitation numbers do not fluctuate at all , and the fluctuations of the higher @xmath163 s are as in the unrestricted ensemble . using the results from the previous subsection",
    "it is easy to compute the functional ( [ functional ] ) , which gives @xmath107 = \\left [ m(k ) - \\left ( \\sum_{m=1}^{p } \\frac{(n_c^{(m)})^k}{m^k } + \\sum_{m = p+1}^{\\infty } \\frac{k!}{\\beta^k m^{2k } } \\right ) \\right]^2 + \\sum_{m = p+1}^{\\infty } \\frac{(2k )",

    "using ( [ zetaestimate ] ) it can be shown that for the fluctuations to be small , one needs to choose @xmath173 ; a value so high that almost all the states are projected out of the ensemble , invalidating the statistical treatment of the system .",
    "we have been unable to find a better method of stabilising the multipoles in the canonical ensemble , as the fluctuations in the excitation numbers are quite severe .",
    "however , one possible resolution to this problem might be that , although naively an observer is able to measure multipoles up to order @xmath174 , this might not hold after a more thorough analysis .",
    "the reason for this is that when an observer measures high multipoles , high energies are needed and the backreaction of these should not be neglected .",
    "also , for low energies it is safe to work within the @xmath0-bps sector , but for large energies one expects @xmath93 and @xmath92 corrections , which might induce a much stricter limit than @xmath175 for the measurable multipoles .",
    "if this was the case , the method of restricting the fluctuations described here could be enough to stabilise the ensemble sufficiently ; a possibility we shall not analyse in more detail in this note .",
    "in this note we proposed a criterion that a ramond ground state in the d1d5 cft has to satisfy in order to have a semi - classical gravity dual .",
    "this proposal was based on the observation that the data characterizing the cft state manifests itself as a set of multipoles in the gravity side .",
    "thus any cft state having a semi - classical gravity dual has to be such that the multipoles associated to it do not have a large quantum variance .",
    "in particular , we showed that the density matrix associated to the canonical ensemble is not ` sufficiently classical ' to admit a semi - classical description , and analysed a possible way of modifying the ensemble to curb these fluctuations .",
    "furthermore we showed that while our criterion restricts the states that can have semi - classical duals , certain purely quantum mechanical aspects can be manifest in the semi - classical gravity dual .",
    "an example of this is the observation that quantum interference in the cft can give rise to new , measurable , terms in the asymptotic expansion of the metric .",
    "[ [ comparison - with - llm ] ] comparison with llm : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    since the story proposed in this note closely parallels the one developed in @xcite for the llm system , it is interesting to analyse the similarities and differences in these systems .    in both cases the relevant states in the cft s can be described in terms of excitations in a harmonic potential ; only in the llm case the excitations are fermionic .",
    "thus a basis state is specified by an ordered set of excitation numbers : @xmath176 , and in @xcite we showed that in the expansion of the metric these integers appear in moments @xmath177 , which should be compared with the multipoles ( [ multipoles ] ) found here .",
    "thus in the llm case it is the highest excitations that contribute the most , while in our case the lowest twists are most strongly manifest in the gravity side .",
    "this difference is presumably due to the fractionalization present in the d1d5 system .",
    "in both cases , however , the cft data is arranged into a set of moments / multipoles in the gravity side .",
    "this analogy extends to superpositions ; in both cases interference terms can be measurable for an asymptotic observer , and some terms in the metric expansion only appear for states that are superpositions of occupation number eigenstates .",
    "another similarity between the two systems is apparent in the treatment of the canonical ensemble .",
    "in the llm case it was found that states with a few highly excited particles , though few in number , contributed disproportionably to the ensemble .",
    "therefore the ensemble was modified by fixing the highest excitation to be a given number @xmath178 @xcite , and the fluctuations in this modified ensemble were sufficiently constrained to yield the correct stretched horizon for the superstar geometry of @xcite . in our case , we found that the fluctuations in the first excitation numbers rendered the ensemble ill - suited for use with the cft - to - gravity mapping , and tried to solve this by fixing the first excitation numbers .",
    "unfortunately , we found that to stabilise the high multipoles , one has to fix so many excitations that one loses the statistical description of the system .",
    "one final difference between the two systems is that , owing to the fact that in llm one has a two dimensional phase space and fermionic excitations , in llm one can compute the entropy of any spacetime geometry in a very elegant manner .",
    "it is not clear if this can be done in our case , though it would be very interesting if it could be done .",
