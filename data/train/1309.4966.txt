    "<S> following the recent work by braguta _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> , we perform an indirect calculation of the chiral vortical conductivity @xmath0 with free lattice overlap fermions by measuring the response of the energy flow to the constant axial magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the measurements are contaminated by very large finite - volume artifacts . </S>",
    "<S> however , the continuum result for finite - temperature contribution to the chiral vortical conductivity @xmath1 is still reproduced in the limit of infinite volume at fixed temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> transport phenomena in chirally imbalanced medium have become a subject of intense research in recent years . </S>",
    "<S> these phenomena are closely related to quantum anomalies and for that reason are extremely interesting from theoretical point of view . </S>",
    "<S> it has been also argued that they might manifest themselves in heavy - ion collision experiments ( see @xcite for an extensive collection of reviews ) . </S>",
    "<S> very recently , these arguments have been supported by fully nonlinear simulations of the anomalous hydrodynamics @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one of such anomalous transport phenomena is the chiral vortical effect ( cve ) - the generation of axial current @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 labels spatial coordinates ) in the direction of the medium vorticity @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the medium velocity @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath0 is the so - called chiral vortical conductivity , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the chiral and the baryon chemical potentials and @xmath9 is the medium temperature . in other words , vortices in a chiral liquid create chirality imbalance . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , this effect exists even in a neutral medium at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it also turns out that the chiral vortical conductivity ( [ chiralvorticalconductivity ] ) might receive nontrivial contributions due to gauge interactions between fermions @xcite .    in the linear response approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the chiral vortical conductivity @xmath0 is expressed in terms of the static correlator of the axial current density @xmath2 and the energy flow vector @xmath10 @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the components of the fermionic energy - momentum tensor which are responsible for the energy flow in the @xmath13-th direction .    </S>",
    "<S> while it is conceptually very difficult to implement matter rotation on the lattice mainly due to problems with periodic boundary conditions ( see @xcite for some work in this direction ) , the correlator ( [ cvelinearresponse ] ) is quite easy to measure on the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> one can simplify the problem even further by noticing that the expression ( [ cvelinearresponse ] ) in fact also describes another anomalous transport phenomenon ( sometimes termed axial magnetic effect ) - the generation of nonzero energy flow @xmath10 in the direction of the axial magnetic field @xmath14 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 is the axial gauge field which couples to dirac fermions as @xmath16 . in close analogy with the lattice studies of the chiral magnetic effect ( see e.g. @xcite ) one can then introduce a constant axial magnetic field on the lattice and measure the energy flow along it . </S>",
    "<S> technically , an advantage of the approach of @xcite is that only the expectation value of a single fermionic bilinear operator should be measured , rather than the correlator of two operators in ( [ cvelinearresponse ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this significantly simplifies algorithms and improves the signal - to - noise ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the results of such measurements in @xmath17 quenched lattice gauge theory with zero chiral and baryonic chemical potentials were reported recently in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the chiral vortical conductivity is equal to zero within statistical errors in the confinement phase and is almost by an order of magnitude smaller than the result ( [ chiralvorticalconductivity ] ) in the deconfinement phase at the temperature @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can expect that by virtue of asymptotic freedom in the limit of very high temperatures the chiral vortical conductivity approaches its value ( [ chiralvorticalconductivity ] ) for free fermions .    on the other hand , in the recent work @xcite it was demonstrated that anomalous transport phenomena such as chiral magnetic effect are extremely sensitive to finite volume and finite temperature effects . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it was found that lattice measurements of cme with free chiral lattice fermions in the background of a constant magnetic field in a finite volume yield only half of the result which one can obtain from anomaly - based arguments . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary studies have also indicated that the value of the chiral magnetic conductivity is also extremely sensitive to lattice artifacts which lead to the non - conservation of the vector current . </S>",
    "<S> such artifacts are also present in the measurements of @xcite , since the naive discretization of the energy flow vector used in this work is in general not conserved . in view of these considerations , it is reasonable to ask whether the discrepancy between the lattice results of @xcite in the deconfinement phase and the free - fermion result ( [ chiralvorticalconductivity ] ) is due to the lattice or finite - volume artifacts or due to the genuinely strong - coupling nature of the quark - gluon plasma state .    in these proceedings </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the chiral vortical conductivity for free overlap fermions on the lattice and check the validity of the result ( [ chiralvorticalconductivity ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use the same lattice setup as in @xcite and study the naively discretized energy flow along the direction of the constant axial magnetic field .    as demonstrated in @xcite , overlap dirac operator in the presence of both vector and axial gauge fields @xmath19 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 should satisfy the following functional equation : @xmath21 }    =    \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_{\\mu } { \\left ( x \\right ) } } \\mathcal{d}_{ov } { \\left [ v_{\\mu } { \\left ( x \\right ) } , a_{\\mu } { \\left ( x \\right ) } \\right ] }    \\gamma_5 { \\left ( 1 - \\mathcal{d}_{ov } { \\left [ v_{\\mu } { \\left ( x \\right ) } , a_{\\mu } { \\left ( x \\right ) } \\right ] } \\right ) } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation drastically simplifies if one formulates it in terms of the overlap dirac propagator @xmath22 : @xmath23 where in the last line we have used the ginsparg - wilson relation and the arguments of @xmath24 were not shown for the sake of brevity . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus arrived at the linear equation , which has a straightforward solution in terms of the chiral projectors @xmath25 : @xmath26 } =   \\mathcal{p}_{+ } \\mathcal{d}_{ov}^{-1 } { \\left [ v_{\\mu } + a_{\\mu } \\right ] } \\mathcal{p}_{- }   +   \\mathcal{p}_{- } \\mathcal{d}_{ov}^{-1 } { \\left [ v_{\\mu } - a_{\\mu } \\right ] } \\mathcal{p}_{+ }   + 1/2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the propagators @xmath27 } $ ] are obtained from the overlap dirac operators @xmath28 } $ ] in the background of the vector gauge fields @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are coupled to fermions in a standard way by including the corresponding link factors into finite difference operators entering the dirac - wilson operator which is used to define the overlap dirac operator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the integration constant @xmath30 in ( [ propagatorsolution ] ) is fixed by the requirement that at @xmath31 one obtains the conventional overlap propagator in the background of the vector field @xmath19 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar construction for the overlap dirac propagator in the presence of an axial gauge field was also used in @xcite , however , an integration constant of @xmath30 was not taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> it is indeed irrelevant for the chiral vortical effect . </S>",
    "<S> however , this constant in fact incorporates the effect of axial anomaly on the lattice @xcite and can be extremely important for other anomalous transport phenomena such as chiral magnetic effect or chiral separation effect .    in order to implement the constant axial magnetic field on the lattice </S>",
    "<S> , we use the configuration of @xmath20 which yields the constant lattice field strength @xmath32 in ( [ propagatorsolution ] ) and set @xmath33 . due to flux quantization , possible values of field strength are @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the spatial lattice size and @xmath36 is an integer . </S>",
    "<S> chiral and baryon chemical potentials are set to zero . </S>",
    "<S> overlap dirac operator is calculated and inverted using ` lapack ` . </S>",
    "<S> the energy flow along the axial magnetic field @xmath37 ( [ energymomentumtensor ] ) is then calculated as in @xcite .     +    on figure [ fig : cve_vs_nb5 ] we plot the energy flow @xmath38 along the direction of the axial magnetic field as a function of field strength for different temperatures and different spatial lattice sizes . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that lattice spacing is equal to unity . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that in accordance with ( [ cveclassical ] ) the energy flow is almost a linear function of @xmath39 with a slight tendency for saturation at large values of @xmath39 .     </S>",
    "<S> +    in order to extract the value of the chiral vortical conductivity , we perform the linear fits of the energy flow as a function of @xmath39 , using data points with three smallest values of @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are illustrated on fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cve_finite_volume ] for different temperatures and different lattice sizes . </S>",
    "<S> an immediate conclusion is that the finite - volume effects are very strong , several times stronger than the continuum , infinite - volume result ( [ chiralvorticalconductivity ] ) . however , from the right plot on fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cve_finite_volume ] one can also see that if one increases the lattice size at fixed temperature , the chiral vortical conductivity indeed tends to the continuum result ( [ chiralvorticalconductivity ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller is the temperature , the larger should be the lattice size .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the continuum result ( [ chiralvorticalconductivity ] ) is indeed reproduced for free overlap lattice fermions , however , finite - volume effects are very strong and one should perform a very careful extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit . </S>"
