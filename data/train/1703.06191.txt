    "the central region of the orion nebula ( ngc1976 ) is arguably the best studied hii  region @xcite . as the exemplar of its class of gaseous nebulae it has also been subject to many attempts at modeling the physics that occurs and the 3-d structure .",
    "we understand that it is basically an irregular concave thin layer of ionized gas lying nearer the observer than the main ionization front ( mif ) that marks the boundary with the host background molecular cloud .",
    "there is also a nearby foreground thin layer ( the veil ) of partially ionized gas .",
    "the usual assumption is that ionization in this region is dominated by the brightest star in the compact trapezium group , the complex hot star @xmath0  ori  c , whose spectral type is usually assigned as about o6 .",
    "the next hottest and most luminous star is @xmath1  ori  a , which lies 135  southeast of @xmath0  ori  c. as one moves further from the trapezium the degree of ionization decreases , consistent with the ionizing star or stars being in the central nebula @xcite .",
    "it is important in interpreting the nebula s spectra to understand if a secondary star or stars play a role in ionization of the nebula .",
    "the inner ionized nebula is actually very complex in structure , there being irregular features in the concave surface , the most famous of which is the bright bar , and there is a neutral cloud of material containing very young stars known as the orion - south cloud ( hereafter orion - s ) lying 55  to the southwest of @xmath0  ori  c. interpreting the spectra and emission - line images of the nebula demands knowing the source of ionization for each region .",
    "that is the goal of this study .",
    "two approaches are adopted . in section  [ sec :",
    "ionization ] we utilize the predictions of key tracers of different degrees of ionization . in section  [ sec : proplyds ] we utilize resolved ionization fronts formed around gas surrounding many of orion s proplyds .",
    "numerous assumptions have been made in this study .",
    "there are many similar values for the distance to the orion nebula , but in this study we have adopted 388@xmath28 pc from the recent radio results of @xcite . for @xmath0  ori  c ,",
    "we have adopted a temperature ( t@xmath3 ) of 38950 k and total luminosity in photons capable of ionizing hydrogen ( @xmath4 ) of 7.35@xmath510@xmath6 photons s@xmath7 @xcite . for @xmath1",
    "ori  a  at o9.5  v @xcite , we use values from table 2.3 of @xcite of t@xmath3  =  34600 k and @xmath4  =  3.63@xmath510@xmath6 photons s@xmath7 .",
    "we express distances in the plane of the sky in parsecs , using the adopted distance .",
    "the ionized layer on the observer s side of the mif is stratified into layers according to the varying ionization .",
    "these layers are determined by the energy of the stellar photons reaching them and this energy distribution is controlled by the absorption of the ions of the most common elements , hydrogen and helium .",
    "close to the ionizing star hydrogen is ionized and oxygen is doubly ionized ( easily traced by the [ o  iii ]  500.7 nm line ) .",
    "helium is singly ionized ( easily traced by the hei  667.8 nm line ) .",
    "this is the he@xmath8+h@xmath8  zone . for the relatively cool orion nebula stars there is no higher ionization zone ( where helium would be doubly ionized ) .",
    "further from the ionizing star and closer to the mif is the narrow he@xmath9+h@xmath8  zone , where helium is neutral and hydrogen is ionized .",
    "nitrogen is singly ionized and is most visible in the [ n  ii ]  658.3 nm line .",
    "the easily visible balmer h@xmath10  and h@xmath11  lines arise from both ionization zones .",
    "we selected seven regions that were expected to illuminate the question of the ionizing star in various parts of the orion nebula .",
    "these all fall within the region of calibrated monochromatic images obtained with the muse @xcite multi - aperture spectrograph .",
    "reddening corrected line ratios from the muse data - base are used throughout this study .",
    "figure  [ fig : mosaic ] shows the location and sizes of these samples .",
    "they include regions near @xmath0  ori  c  and others on both sides of the bright bar .    the ratio of lines f([o",
    "iii])/f(h@xmath11 ) and f(hei)/f(h@xmath10 ) within the he@xmath8+h@xmath8  zone and f([n  ii])/f(h@xmath10 ) within the he@xmath9+h@xmath8  zone are dependent on the temperature of the ionizing star and a quantity defined as the ionization parameter * u *   @xcite , which is the ratio of the density of photons that can ionize hydrogen to the local hydrogen density ( n@xmath12 ) .",
    "we can approximate the local hydrogen density as the electron density ( n@xmath13 ) since hydrogen is essentially completely ionized and the @xmath14 contribution from hei  is small .",
    "we can calculate the photon density ( @xmath15 ) from the total ionizing photon luminosity of the ionizing star ( @xmath4 ) and the true distance to the emitting layer ( * r * ) , and this leads to the relation    @xmath16    where c is the velocity of light .      in this section we present a series of new ionization simulations of the orion h  ii region .",
    "we use version c17.00 of cloudy , the spectral simulation code last described by @xcite .",
    "the geometry is that used by @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the physical thickness of the h@xmath17 layer that constitutes the h  ii region is much thinner than the separation to the ionizing stars .",
    "the geometry is plane parallel .",
    "the layer is assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium with the h@xmath17 layer held back against the molecular cloud by the combination of gas pressure in the x - ray emitting hot gas surrounding the star cluster , and the absorbed outward momentum in the starlight .",
    "this model was originally applied to central regions of the nebula , close to the trapezium , where we are most likely viewing the h@xmath17 layer nearly face on . however , the bright huygens region is most likely bowl shaped , as described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the observed surface brightness of the layer is affected by two things .",
    "first , as the distance of the star increases , the flux of ionizing photons , which sets the surface brightness , falls as * r*@xmath18 .",
    "this causes the surface brightness to decrease with increasing radius . at the same time , the `` tilt '' of the h@xmath19 layer to our line of sight increases ( see fig 3 of @xcite ) which causes the surface brightness to _ increase _ by a factor @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the viewing angle measured relative to the normal to the layer , as long as our line of sight passes through the entire layer , the relative emission - line intensities _ do not _ change , only their total surface brightness .",
    "this simple geometry breaks down when the viewing angle approaches edge - on , since we then see successive regions projected on the plane of the sky , resolving the ionization structure .",
    "this occurs within the bar @xcite or near edges of proplyds . in this case",
    "a more complex model can be developed @xcite . for simplicity , in this study",
    "we use the @xcite approach and remain mindful that it will break down in edge - on cases .",
    "we calculated the line ratios f([o  iii],500.7 nm)/f(h@xmath11 ) , f(hei,667.8 nm)/f(h@xmath10 ) , and f([n  ii],658.3 nm)/f(h@xmath10 ) for a variety of conditions .",
    "the models adopted a progression of values of the ionizing star temperature and the ionization parameter .",
    "we used the stellar sed described in @xcite . in both figures the predicted values of the line ratios are plotted as contour lines .",
    "the lines in these ratios are at close wavelengths and relatively insensitive to reddening by foreground dust .",
    "furthermore , the models were compared with reddening corrected line ratios .      by comparing the derived data for each sample with the expected values for the candidate ionizing star , we can identify that star .",
    "the apparent value of * u *   ( * u*@xmath22 ) was calculated from the equation    @xmath23    where @xmath24  is the separation of the sample and the candidate ionizing star and we have adopted the n@xmath13  value derived from the red [ s  ii ]  ratio . this calculation was done for both @xmath0  ori  c  and @xmath1  ori  a. this means that a given sample is represented twice , once in figure  [ fig : ratios1c ] and again in figure  [ fig : ratios2a ] , the first using * u*@xmath22  for @xmath0  ori  c  and the second using *",
    "u*@xmath22  for @xmath1  ori  a , but the same line ratio for the sample .",
    "we do not know * r * , but we do know a lower limit , @xmath24 . therefore an ionization parameter calculated using @xmath24  ( * u*@xmath22 ) is an upper limit .",
    "if the assumed ionizing star is correct , then each derived point will lie on the intersection of the observed line ratio and t@xmath3  or to the upper left .",
    "a greater separation means a larger difference between * r *  and @xmath24 , that is , there must be a greater distance correction .",
    "if the observed point lies to the right of the intersection or if a projection along a constant line ratio does not reach the t@xmath3   value , then that sample is not ionized by the assumed star .",
    "we do see two points ( c and f ) in the f([n  ii])/f(h@xmath10 ) panel of figure  [ fig : ratios1c ] that lie to the right of the intersection with t@xmath3  for @xmath0  ori  c. these fall in a very flat region for the predicted flux ratio .",
    "if we had adopted a smaller distance to the orion nebula , then the values of * u*@xmath22  would be larger for all points , and samples c and f would have shifted to near the intersection . however , our adopted value for the distance is already smaller than many modern determinations , as summarized in @xcite .",
    "it is more likely that the cloudy model that we adopt is beginning to break - down in sample c and sample f due to the large viewing angle .",
    "our model assumes that we are observing along a line - of - sight that goes through the entire h@xmath17 layer .",
    "when the mif is highly tilted we resolve the ionization structure on the plane of the sky , and so sample along layers within the column .",
    "this compromises a comparison of a line - of - sight models against observations of a highly tilted region .",
    "we would expect that the results for the f([n  ii])/f(h@xmath10 ) ratio would be affected the most since the [ n ii ] line forms in a small part of the h@xmath17 layer .",
    "although the peak of the tilt of the mif is a maximum at the nearby bright bar , @xcite establish that the region near our sample c and sample f is already highly tilted .      in figure",
    "[ fig : ratios1c ] we compare our observations with the brightest star in the orion nebula , @xmath0  ori  c. figure  [ fig : ratios2a ] is similar , but assumes that the isolated bright star @xmath1  ori  a  is the source .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ratios1c ] we see that samples a , b , c , f , and g are all ionized by @xmath0  ori  c , although the f([n  ii])/f(h@xmath10 ) ratios for samples c and f fall to the right of t@xmath3(@xmath0  ori  c ) . in f([o",
    "iii])/f(h@xmath11 ) and f(hei)/f(h@xmath10 ) we see that all samples are consistent with ionization by @xmath0  ori  c , with the caveat of the remarks in section  [ sec : methodology ] about the high t@xmath3  values for samples c and f. taken at face value f([o  iii])/f(h@xmath11 ) and f(hei)/f(h@xmath10 ) indicate that samples c and f have spatial distances about equal to @xmath24  while samples g , a , and b demand progressively larger corrections to the true distance . in the left and right",
    "panels it appears that sample d could also be associated with @xmath0  ori  c , but in the middle panel we see that no plausible correction for distance would make the line ratio compatible with t@xmath3  for @xmath0  ori  c. all of the @xmath0  ori  c  associated samples fall within the central cavity of the nebula .",
    "sample e can be associated with ionization by @xmath0  ori  c  with a small adjustment in u , which is allowable even though it is much further on the sky than either of the difficult to interpret sample c or sample f.    in figure  [ fig : ratios2a ] we note that only sample d agrees with ionization by @xmath1  ori  a  with similar distance corrections in all ratios .",
    "the appearance of the ionized edge of the nearby proplyd 244.3 - 439.8 indicates dominant ionization by @xmath1  ori  a  but with some possible contribution by @xmath0  ori  c  ( section  [ sec : proplyds ] ) . clearly samples a , b , c , f , and g",
    "are not associated with @xmath1  ori  a. those samples lie on the @xmath0  ori  c  side of the bright bar and have already been associated with that star .",
    "sample e agrees with an association with @xmath1  ori  a   in the f([o  iii])/(h@xmath11 ) without a distance correction ; but , in the f(hei)/f(h@xmath10 ) and f([n  ii])/f(h@xmath10 ) ratios it lies too far to the right of t@xmath3  for @xmath1  ori  a , which rules out @xmath1  ori  a.    the identification of the inner five samples as being ionized by @xmath0  ori  c  falls within the accepted model of this region of the orion nebula , i.e. that it is a concave irregular surface.the sample apparently ionized by @xmath1  ori  a  is consistent with the bright bar and the regions southeast from there being ionized by the nearest hot star .",

    "there is a completely independent method of identifying the dominant source of ionization using high resolution images of the orion nebula proplyds . these are young stars with circum - stellar material in or projected upon hii  regions . under favorable orientations and locations",

    "more relevant here , these disks are surrounded by much larger envelopes of gas and dust .",

    "[ fig : mosaic ] we have added white arrows on a representative sample of the proplyds . the arrows point in the direction of the bright arc pointing towards that proplyd s ionizing star .",

    "were made at eleven locations to the southeast of the central orion nebula .",

    "sample v2 falls near the edge of the sharp southeast boundary of the eon and sample v3 falls on this boundary .",
    "these samples do not agree with the results from the others because sample v3 is certainly an ionization front viewed edge - on and sample v2 is probably a region that is rising towards that feature @xcite and thus our cloudy models do not provide a guide to the conditions ( section  [ sec : methodology ] ) .",
    "they are not similar to the other samples and are not included in our discussion of the general properties of the spitzer samples .",

    "the comparison with the results assuming @xmath1  ori  a  ( red labels ) are fully consistent with that star as the dominant ionizing star , since sample i4 is closest to @xmath1  ori  a  and our sample d in the plane of the sky and the i3 , i2 , and i1 samples progress further away .",
    "their locations in figure  [ fig : neon ] indicate a succession of corrections for projection effects and at large distances the samples are close to t@xmath3  for @xmath1  ori  a.",
    "the results of section  [ sec : ionization ] and section  [ sec : proplyds ] show similar but not identical results . some of the differences may be explained by the methodology .    the f([o  iii])/f(h@xmath11 ) and f(hei)/f(h@xmath10 ) line ratios are indicators of the conditions in the he@xmath8+h@xmath8  zone as [ o  iii ]  and hei  emission arise only there as does most of the h@xmath10  emission .",
    "the gas density decreases @xcite with increasing distance from the mif , therefore most of the emission used in the f([o  iii])/f(h@xmath11 ) and f(hei)/f(h@xmath10 ) line ratios method occurs near the onset of the he@xmath8+h@xmath8  zone , with a lesser h@xmath10  contribution from the narrower he@xmath9+h@xmath8  zone .",
    "the distributions of doubly ionized oxygen ( producing the [ o  iii ]  emission ) and hei  ions ( producing the 667.8 nm emission ) are slightly different within the he@xmath8+h@xmath8  zone .",
    "this means that the ratios using these two ions will give slightly different results . in the he@xmath9+h@xmath8  zone the [ n  ii ]  emission",
    "is well constrained , but the fact that the h@xmath10  emission comes mostly from the he@xmath8+h@xmath8  zone , means that the f([n  ii])/f(h@xmath10 ) ratio is intrinsically not as good a diagnostic .",
    "in contrast , the proplyds give an indication of the ionization of objects located somewhere along the line of sight from the foreground veil and the mif .",
    "the orion nebula cluster is centered near the trapezium and monotonically decreases in stellar density with increasing distance in all directions .",
    "this means that a proplyd lying in the same direction as a ratios sample can lie well displaced towards the observer .",
    "this difference of sampling can explain the similarities and differences in the results .",
    "we can , however , approximately determine the position of the mif samples with respect to the plane in the sky of the ionizing star .",
    "for each observed sample we can compare the  observed \" * u*@xmath22  with the value where the same line ratio intersects t@xmath3 .",
    "the shift in * u *  gives us the square of * r*/@xmath24 , hence that ratio .",
    "for example , if the * u*@xmath22  is four times larger than where that line ratio intersects t@xmath3 , then * u*@xmath22  is four times too large and the true distance ( * r * ) is twice the separation in the plane of the sky ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "it follows that the angle of * r *  with respect to the plane of the sky ( @xmath25 ) will be arccos(@xmath24/*r * ) and the distance along the line of sight ( z ) is z  =  @xmath24@xmath5tan  @xmath25 .",
    "what we actually determine is @xmath26 and @xmath2z",
    ".    assignment to positive ( towards the observer ) or negative can usually be determined by comparing the z values with respect to the quantitative models of the orion nebula . from the ratio of the surface brightness in the radio continuum with that expected from ionization by @xmath0  ori  c , both @xcite and @xcite derived a model of a concave surface with ridges ( e.g. the one producing the bright bar ) .",
    "the former presumed a distance to the nebula of 500 pc and the latter 430 pc .",
    "their derived separation ( z ) values were -0.2 pc and about -0.15 pc . in their study of the spectrum of the substellar point using cloudy , @xcite used 0.10 pc .",
    "we assume in our discussion that the sub-@xmath0  ori  c  distance is -0.15 pc",

    "this agrees with the rapid increase of surface brightness west of @xmath0  ori  c.    if the values for samples c , f , and g @xmath25 were negative , then this would imply that the nebula is basically flat to the southeast from @xmath0  ori  c. this is incompatible with the fact that the surface brightness in h@xmath10  is nearly constant ( which requires that the surface curves towards the observer because the ionizing flux from @xmath0  ori  c  falls with * r * ) .",

    "this transition is illustrated well in an f([n  ii])/f(h@xmath10 ) image such as figure  24 of @xcite .",
    "the southwest high ionization region is marked by numerous crenellations lying immediately southeast of the bright bar .",
    "these features have sharp boundaries and are likely to be shocks driven by a series of outflows from the orion - s star formation region @xcite .",

    "the region between sample d and @xmath1  ori  a   is relatively smooth and structure - free ( except for the overlying shocks of hh  203 and hh  204 ) .",
    "this means that the sample must lie away from the observer relative to the plane of @xmath1  ori  a. the progression of decreasing displacements of the neon line ratios in going from sample i4 to sample i1 indicates that sample i4 is well beyond @xmath1  ori  a  but by position i1 the ionization front is close to the same plane as @xmath1  ori  a.    this result is quite different from that in @xcite . in that study",
    "they argue in a qualitative way that all of the region along their samples ( to the southeast , beyond the bright bar ) is ionized by @xmath0  ori  c , under the assumption that @xmath1  ori  a  is incapable of creating local [ ne  iii ]  emission .",
    "our cloudy models indicate that this is not the case and our examination of the variations of the f([ne  iii])/f([ne  ii ] ) ratio firmly establish that @xmath1  ori  a  is the dominant ionizing star in this region .",
    "in section  [ sec : comparison ] we established that sample e , which lies outside the bright bar , is dominantly ionized by @xmath0  ori  c. however , this identification was good only for the f([o  iii])/f(h@xmath11 ) and f(hei)/f(h@xmath10 ) ratios with a surprisingly large distance correction , while f([n  ii])/f(h@xmath10 ) indicated that no distance correction was required . in the comparison with line ratios predicated on ionization by @xmath1  ori  a , the observed points were close to t@xmath3  for that star , but always slightly hotter .",
    "it is most likely that sample e is ionized by both @xmath0  ori  c  and @xmath1  ori  a.",
    "we have confirmed the usual assumption that the bright portion of the orion nebula lying within the boundary of the southeast bright bar is dominantly ionized by the hottest star in the trapezium grouping ( @xmath0  ori  c ) . with the exception of a single region ( sample e ) ,",
