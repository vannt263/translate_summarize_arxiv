    "despite the rapid development of computational techniques in the last decades , a first principles investigation of strongly correlated disordered alloys is still very challenging . nowadays ,",
    "substitutional alloys are mainly studied by two different approaches ( for recent reviews see  @xcite or @xcite and references therein ) . in the first approach , a large supercell with randomly distributed atoms of different types is employed .",
    "this strategy is easy to implement and allows one to investigate the properties related to local geometry .",
    "the main drawbacks of this approach are the high computational costs and discrete set of concentrations .",
    "the second approach involves the mean - field ideology for description of substitutional alloys .",
    "this ideology is commonly implemented using the coherent potential approximation  @xcite ( cpa ) .",
    "the main idea of the cpa is to provide the same physical properties of one component effective medium as an average of alloy species , embedded in this effective medium . at present , the cpa implementation with the so - called diagonal type of disorder is considered to be the best local approximation for alloys  @xcite . at the same time , it is clear that the cpa can not be used to study short - range order effects in alloys , and extensions are needed .    in order to describe the properties of actual alloys from first principles , the density functional theory ( dft )",
    "uses both above mentioned approaches , which suffer from all dft problems .",
    "in particular , the paramagnetic state can not be properly simulated by the nonmagnetic dft calculations , and the dft alone usually fails to reproduce the properties of strongly correlated systems . for solution of the former problem",
    ", the disordered local moment ( dlm ) method is widely used  @xcite . in this method",
    "the paramagnetic state is modeled by randomly distributed magnetic moments in a supercell with a condition of zero net magnetization .",
    "the later problem is usually solved using the so - called lda+@xmath2 method  @xcite , where the strong electronic correlations are treated in a static way .",
    "application of these methods in combination with cpa gives good results  @xcite . at the same time , the lda+@xmath2 works well for insulators with long - range magnetic order , while it is less suitable for metallic systems .",
    "also additional approximations are required to describe finite temperature effects .",
    "the dynamical mean - field theory  @xcite ( dmft ) was developed two decades ago , and presently it is regarded as a very powerful tool for the description of strongly correlated systems . in this theory a lattice problem with many degrees of freedom is replaced by a correlated atom ( or ion ) embedded in the energy - dependent effective medium which has to be determined self - consistently .",
    "the finite temperature green s function formalism is employed for the solution of impurity problem .",
    "it allows one to treat properly both the temperature effects and paramagnetic state .",
    "the combination of the dmft with density functional theory ( dft+dmft or lda+dmft ) resulted in a good description of the spectral properties of strongly correlated paramagnetic compounds  @xcite .",
    "afterwards , the dft+dmft method was successfully applied to study different properties of real materials ( for review see  @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the cpa and dmft methods share the effective medium or mean - field interpretation , and thus they can be easily combined .",
    "the first application of the dmft to the anderson - hubbard model ( hubbard model with disorder ) was done by jani  @xcite who investigated thermodynamic properties and constructed a phase diagram .",
    "later , many authors studied the magnetic  @xcite , spectral  @xcite , and thermodynamical properties  @xcite of disordered hubbard model .",
    "particularly , they found that the metal - insulator transition can occur in a correlated alloy at non - integer filling  @xcite , and a system can be driven from weakly to strongly correlated regime by change of disorder strength or concentration  @xcite . in the framework of",
    "_ ab  initio _ calculations , the cpa+dmft method was used to study the spectral and magnetic properties of binary alloys  @xcite and heusler alloys  @xcite .",

    ", we propose a computational scheme for total energy calculations of substitutional alloys with strong electronic correlations .",
    "the scheme is implemented within the cpa+dmft approach and applied to study the structural transition in fe - mn alloys with manganese content from 10 to 20 at .",

    "% of mn , this transition occurs in the paramagnetic region  @xcite , which significantly complicates the use of most electronic structure calculation methods .",
    "the previous first principles studies of fe - mn alloys were performed using the cpa approach implemented within emto formalism  @xcite and supercell approach  @xcite .",
    "the paramagnetic state was simulated by means of the dlm model . in these studies ,",
    "the elastic properties  @xcite , magnetic properties  @xcite , lattice stability  @xcite , and stacking fault energy  @xcite were investigated .",

    "the influence of al and si additions on the elastic properties and lattice stability was investigated in  @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in all previous studies of fe - mn alloys",
    "the coulomb correlations were considered in some average sense within dft , while they were demonstrated to play a crucial role in pure iron  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : method ] we present a computational scheme of the cpa+dmft method for real alloys implemented for total energy calculations . in section  [ sec : results ] we employ this technique to study the phase stability and magnetic properties of fe - mn alloys .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "let us consider a binary alloy a@xmath9b@xmath3 with substitutional type of disorder .",
    "it can be described by the anderson - hubbard hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin  @xmath13 at orbital  @xmath14 of site  @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the chemical potential , @xmath18 is the hopping amplitude , @xmath19 is the on - site energy , @xmath20 denotes the hermitian conjugate of the preceding term .",
    "the last term in hamiltonian  ( [ ham_cpa+dmft ] ) corresponds to the on - site coulomb interaction , which is considered in the density - density form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an element of the coulomb interaction matrix .",
    "the on - site potential @xmath19 and coulomb matrix @xmath22 depend on the site index @xmath15 and are different for different atomic species . at the same time",
    ", each site can be occupied by atom of type  a with probability @xmath23 or of type  b with probability  @xmath24 .",
    "the hopping amplitudes are assumed to be site - independent , which implies similar shapes of band structures for constituents a and b. this approximation is reasonable for constituents with similar electronic structures , when the on - site local potentials are close in energy relative to the bandwidth  @xcite .    for material specific calculations all parameters of hamiltonian  ( [ ham_cpa+dmft ] ) are to be determined , and we follow the conventional lda+dmft prescription  @xcite .",
    "in this case , the hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath25 here , the kinetic contribution is replaced by the dft hamiltonian @xmath26 calculated in a basis of wannier functions or other localized orbitals .",
    "the on - site local potential @xmath19 can also be found from dft results as a center of gravity of orbital @xmath14 at site @xmath15 in a supercell calculation .",
    "the following disorder parameter can be introduced as a difference between centers of gravity for different atomic species : @xmath27 the constrained dft method  @xcite can be used to determine elements of the screened coulomb interaction matrix @xmath22 .",
    "the last term in equation  ( [ ham_dft ] ) , @xmath28 , is introduced to avoid double counting of the coulomb interaction already present in @xmath26 .",
    "the fully localized limit is taken , and @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the average coulomb interaction , and @xmath31 .    within the cpa+dmft approach a real alloy",
    "is replaced by an effective medium with local green function @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the fermionic matsubara frequencies , @xmath34 denote the inverse temperature , @xmath35 is the unit matrix , @xmath36 is the local effective potential or self - energy , which has to be determined self - consistently .",
    "the integration is performed over the first brillouin zone of volume  @xmath37 .",
    "in contrast to the conventional cpa approach , the self - energy now contains information not only about disorder , but also about electronic correlations . using the dyson equation",
    "one can obtain the bath green function @xmath38 which is required to calculate the impurity green functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the action of impurity embedded in the effective medium is @xmath41 \\c_{m\\s}(\\wn )   \\\\         &    & + \\int_0^{\\beta } d\\tau\\ , u^i_{mm'\\s\\s ' } \\hat n^i_{m\\s}(\\tau ) \\hat n^i_{m'\\s'}(\\tau),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the hybridization function .",
    "the corresponding impurity green function can be expressed as @xmath43 according to the cpa ideology , the local green function of effective medium is interpreted as a weighted sum of impurity green functions : @xmath44 having obtained @xmath45 by equation  ( [ gf33 ] ) , one can easily compute the new self - energy from the dyson equation : @xmath46 this new effective potential is then used in equation  ( [ gloc ] ) to calculate the local green function of effective medium .",
    "the above equations are iteratively solved until the convergence with respect to the self - energy is achieved .    in the orbital space , the above green functions ,",
    "self - energies and other quantities are matrices of the same size as @xmath26 . at the same time",
    ", they have a block diagonal structure in the orbital space , and hence solution for different types of orbitals can be performed separately . for the uncorrelated subspace ( wannier functions of @xmath47  character ) ,",
    "the impurity action in equation  ( [ eq : action ] ) becomes gaussian , and the impurity green function can be evaluated straightforwardly : @xmath48 to calculate the impurity green functions in the correlated subspace ( the wannier functions of @xmath49 character ) , the equation  ( [ eq : g_a ] ) is to be solved .",
    "the continuous - time quantum monte - carlo method  @xcite was used for the above purpose .    the calculation of total energy has been thoroughly discussed for the lda+dmft method  @xcite and for a single band model of disordered system  @xcite . following the same way , the total energy in the cpa+dmft method can be defined as @xmath50 here , the first term is the total energy obtained in self - consistent dft calculations .",

    "the third term in equation  ( [ tot_en ] ) corresponds to the coulomb energy in cpa+dmft and can be expressed via double occupancies : @xmath52 the fourth term on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ tot_en ] ) is the sum of dft valence - state eigenvalues which is evaluated as the thermal average of dft hamiltonian with the noninteracting dft green function : @xmath53e^{i\\omega_n0^+},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last term in equation  ( [ tot_en ] ) corresponds to the double - counting energy which can be written in the fully localized limit as @xmath55 it should be noted , that the above described cpa+dmft scheme as well as the expression for total energy behave correctly in different limiting cases .",
    "namely , if there is one type of atomic species ( @xmath56 or @xmath57 ) or atomic species are identical ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) all equations reduce to the conventional lda+dmft ones . in the non - interacting limit ( @xmath60 ) , the equations transform to those of classical cpa .    as discussed in the introduction section , the dmft together with cpa",
    "have already been used to study single - band models and real alloys .",
    "in contrast to studies  @xcite where the cpa+dmft approach was implemented within the korringa - kohn - rostoker method , in our computational scheme we first calculate material specific parameters for hamiltonian ( 1 ) and then solve it using cpa+dmft set of equations .",
    "our scheme is similar to that used in  @xcite where the on - site potential was introduced to mimic the na potential in na@xmath3coo@xmath4 .",
    "to perform calculations within dft , we employed the full - potential linearized augmented - plane wave method implemented in the exciting - plus code ( a fork of elk code with wannier function projection procedure  @xcite ) .",

    "the ground state of @xmath8-fe is 99 mev / at lower in energy than the ground state of @xmath7-fe .",
    "the supercells with 8 atoms were constructed by doubling all primitive vectors for fcc structure and two vectors in hexagonal plane for hcp structure . in each supercell",
    ", one atom of fe was substituted by mn atom .",
    "the distances between mn and its nearest periodic image are equal to 5.065    and 4.086    for the fcc and hcp structures , respectively .",
    "we note that the local relaxation effects are neglected within our scheme . in the case of fe - mn alloy",
    ", they are expected to be insignificant , since fe and mn are neighbours in the periodic table and have close atomic radii ( 1.26    and 1.27   , respectively ) .",
    "a detailed comparison of cpa results with those obtained using large supercells can be found in  @xcite .    for cpa+dmft calculations",
    "a localized basis is required , and to this aim , effective hamiltonians were constructed for each phase in the basis of wannier functions .",
    "from converged plane wave data the wannier functions were built as a projection of the original kohn - sham states to site - centered localized functions of @xmath67 character as described in  @xcite .",
    "we note that the obtained wannier functions are not maximally localized , that is in fact not necessary for the calculations .",
    "figure  [ fig : bands ] shows the original band structure ( black lines ) for pure fcc fe ( top panel ) and fcc supercell structure ( bottom panel ) in comparison with bands corresponding to the constructed wannier hamiltonians ( red dotes ) .",

    "the manganese ions are cited as impurities . in this terminology , @xmath26 from equation  ( [ ham_dft ] )",
    "is the host hamiltonian , and @xmath68 is already included in @xmath26 .",

    "one can see that the energy bands of mn can be described as those of fe shifted by a constant value .",
    "this value can be regarded as an upper limit for disorder parameter and is about 0.5  ev for @xmath49 states at @xmath73 point .",
    "comparing the band structures of pure elements and constructed supercells ( central panels of figure  [ fig : bands+dos ] ) , one can note a shrinking of the mn @xmath74 bandwidth in the supercells with respect to pure mn .",
    "this is supported by the local densities of states ( figure  [ fig : bands+dos ] , right panels ) for mn and the most distant fe atom in the supercells .",
    "the disorder parameters evaluated for different orbitals as the difference between centers of gravity of corresponding doses are presented in table  [ tab : model ] . since the @xmath75 and @xmath76 bands extend beyond the region where they are well described by the constructed wannier functions ( see figure  [ fig : bands ] ) , the centers of gravity were calculated using energy window of 15  ev .",

    "the proposed computational scheme can be used to study correlation - induced structural and/or magnetic transitions as well as related properties in paramagnetic and magnetically ordered phases of disordered systems . in particular",
    ", we applied it to study the structural transition in paramagnetic fe@xmath9mn@xmath128 alloys with @xmath24 from 0.1 to 0.2 .",
    "the calculated transition temperature is in a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the local magnetic moment on mn was found to have more pronounced temperature dependence in phase than in phase . upon cooling ,",
    "this leads to the lowering the energy of phase with respect to phase due to magnetic correlation energy .",
    "both the coulomb and kinetic energies were demonstrated to contribute to the transition .",
    "this is in contrast to the transition in pure fe , where the magnetic correlation energy alone was shown to be responsible for the structural transformation  @xcite .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the kinetic energy in cpa+dmft approach includes both the electronic correlations and disorder effects which can not be separated .    considering the alloys with mn content from 10 to 20  at .",
    "% , we found that the decrease of the transition temperature is caused by the coulomb energy .",
    "this agrees well with the above mentioned finding that the magnetic correlation energy of mn favours the stabilization of phase at low temperatures .",
    "the obtained results indicate that the cpa+dmft approach is a promising tool for studying the real substitutional alloys with strong electronic correlations .",
    "the authors are grateful to m a korotin and yu n gornostyrev for useful discussions .",
