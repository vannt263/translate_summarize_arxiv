    "these manifolds enable one to define the _ slow _ part of the evolution of the trajectory curve of such systems . until now",
    ", it seems that , except for the works of @xcite , no one has investigated the problem of _ one - dimensional sets _ which play a very important role in the structure of chaotic attractors by connecting their fixed points .",
    "the aim of this work is to define and present methods for constructing such one - dimensional sets .",

    "the first attempt to study one - dimensional sets has been made in the context of fluid mechanics by roth and peikert @xcite .",
    "the idea of transporting the concept of `` vortex core curves '' to the phase space of dynamical systems is due to one of us ( r.g . ) , who applied it to three - dimensional dynamical systems and then to higher - dimensional dynamical systems . in the context of classical differential geometry ,",

    "iii we introduce the idea of the vortex core curve through an eigenvalue - like equation derived from the condition that one of the eigendirections of the jacobian of the velocity vector field is colinear with the velocity vector field .",
