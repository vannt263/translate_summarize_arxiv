    "in his 1866 memoir @xcite , de jonquires computed the number of divisors with prescribed multiplicities that are contained in a fixed linear series on a given plane algebraic curve .",
    "almost a century later , and using modern techniques of topology and intersection theory of cycles on the symmetric product on a curve , macdonald @xcite and mattuck @xcite recovered the original formula in characteristic zero and arbitrary characteristic , respectively and generalised it to linear series of any dimension .",
    "however , their work does not address the vagueness of the classical statements , assuming either that the linear series in question is sufficiently generic , or that the multiplicities are counted correctly . to address this issue ,",
    "vainsencher @xcite described the locus of divisors with prescribed multiplicities as the vanishing locus of a section of a bundle of the appropriate rank . using a natural filtration of this bundle , he computed its chern classes without making use of the grothendieck - riemann - roch theorem , and established the enumerative validity of the de jonquires formula for plane curves and for some higher dimensional cases .",
    "this paper represents a first step towards settling the issue of the validity of the de jonquires formula for arbitrary @xmath0 using a variational approach . in other words",
    "our aim is to specify the conditions under which linear series on a curve are allowed to contain a divisor with given multiplicities .",
    "we fix the notation .",

    "we call the corresponding divisor @xmath15 a _ de jonquires divisor of length _ @xmath16 and we denote by @xmath17 the space of de jonquires divisors of length @xmath16 corresponding to the linear series @xmath10 .    the de jonquires formula ( cf",
    ".  @xcite chapter viii , ",
    "5 ) states that , if we expect there to be a finite number of de jonquires divisors of length @xmath16 , then this virtual number is given by the coefficient of the monomial @xmath18 in @xmath19    our main result is the following    let @xmath1 be a general curve and consider a triple @xmath20 of positive integers with @xmath21 . then a general linear series @xmath22 does not admit a de jonquires divisor of length @xmath16 . in other words , @xmath17 is empty .",
    "we make a simple observation , which provides the first piece of evidence towards the validity of our result .",
    "eisenbud and harris prove in @xcite that a general linear series of any degree and dimension on a general curve may have only ordinary ramification . as a direct consequence",
    ", we can immediately exclude the existence of any de jonquires divisors where @xmath23 for some @xmath24 . if this is the case , then clearly @xmath25 , which agrees with our statement .    note that theorem 1 holds trivially for rational normal curves and normal elliptic curves .",
    "indeed , in the case of the rational normal curve @xmath26 , while for an elliptic curve @xmath27 .",
    "clearly , if @xmath28 or @xmath29 , respectively , there are no de jonquires divisors of length @xmath16 with positive degree , and hence no general linear series admitting de jonquires divisors of length @xmath16 .    in the particular case of the canonical linear series , our problem is naturally related to that of strata of abelian differentials which have recently received a lot of attention , for example in the work of farkas and pandharipande @xcite in the algebro - geometric context , or that of bainbridge , chen , gendron , grushevsky , and mller @xcite in the teichmller dynamics and flat surfaces context .",
    "in fact , the result of polishchuk @xcite concerning the dimension of the strata turns out to be a crucial ingredient in the proof of our theorem in the case of linear series with index of speciality @xmath30 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the space of de jonquires divisors as a degeneracy locus of vector bundles and thus obtain a lower bound for its dimension , while section 3 is dedicated to the proof of theorem 1 .",

    "i would like to thank my advisor gavril farkas for introducing me to this circle of ideas and for his helpful suggestions to approaching this problem .",
    "i am also grateful to daniele agostini , ignacio barros , and especially irfan kadikyl for many useful discussions .",
    "the space @xmath17 can be described as a degeneracy locus of vector bundles on @xmath31 as follows .",
    "the idea is that the condition @xmath32 is equivalent to the condition that the natural restriction map @xmath33 has non - zero kernel .",
    "these maps constitute a morphism @xmath34 over @xmath31 , where @xmath35 is the trivial bundle .",
    "to construct @xmath36 , consider the diagram        where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the usual projections and @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 set @xmath41 , which is indeed a vector bundle by the cohomology and base change theorem .",

    ", one has @xmath45 .    from the description of @xmath17 as a degeneracy locus",
    ", we get that its codimension in @xmath31 is at most @xmath46",
    "in this section we prove theorem 1 . the plan of the proof is as follows .",
    "the case @xmath47 follows immediately from previously known results , which we summarise below . for @xmath48 , let @xmath49 .",
    "we first prove the statement for non - special linear series ( i.e. @xmath50 ) via an easy argument using an abel - jacobi - type map and for linear series with @xmath30 using a result of polishchuk @xcite .",
    "for the proof in the case of non - complete linear series ( corresponding to @xmath51 ) and in the case of series with @xmath52 we use an induction argument based on degenerations of curves embedded in projective space .      a kodaira - spencer deformation theoretic argument ( cf .",
