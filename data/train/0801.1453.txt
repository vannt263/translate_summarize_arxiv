    "two - component mixtures in general exhibit much richer crystallization phenomena and polymorphism than their one - component counterparts @xcite as witnessed by a huge variety of possible stable binary crystals , e.g. for binary hard sphere systems @xcite .",
    "how the whole crystal phase behavior in mixtures depends on the interparticle interactions is far from being understood even in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this is true also in two spatial dimensions where the number of bravais lattices is smaller than in three dimensions .",
    "binary mixtures in two dimensions have been studied for hard disks @xcite and a complex diagram of close packing was obtained as a function of their diameter ratio .",
    "more recently , a two - dimensional binary mixture with soft interactions was considered @xcite , namely that for parallel dipoles where the pair potential scales with the inverse cube of the interparticle separation .",
    "a variant of this model has been considered in ref . @xcite .",
    "such systems can be realized in granular matter @xcite and in magnetic colloidal suspensions confined to a air - water interface @xcite .",
    "again , as a function of the ratio of dipole moments of the two species , a complex stability phase diagram of stable binary crystals was obtained that qualitatively differs from the hard disk case @xcite . in particular for low asymmetries ,",
    "the hard disk system shows a complete separation into pure @xmath1 and @xmath3 triangular crystals @xcite while the soft dipolar systems possesses two stable mixed crystals as well with stoechiometric ratio @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these differences show that the topology of the phase diagrams depend on details of the interactions and there is certainly a need to understand this dependence in more detail .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a two - dimensional binary system of yukawa particles , i.e. the pair interaction potential @xmath6 between the particles is a screened coulomb interaction @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the screening constant ( or the inverse screening length ) .",
    "this potential interpolates between the case of hard disks ( as obtained in the limit of high @xmath8 ) and the unscreened coulomb case ( as obtained for @xmath9 ) . the latter limit , @xmath10 is even softer than the dipolar case where @xmath11 .",
    "the two components are defined by two different charges , i.e.  different prefactors in front of the yukawa interaction . in previous works ,",
    "such a classical binary mixture with yukawa interactions in three - dimensions has been used as a model to study mixing rules @xcite , effective forces @xcite , fluid - fluid phase separation @xcite , dynamical correlations @xcite and transport properties @xcite .",
    "likewise the pure ( one - component ) yukawa system was also studied in two - spatial dimensions for fluid structure @xcite , dynamics @xcite and transport properties @xcite . binary mixtures of yukawa particles in two dimensions have also been studied for fluid structure @xcite , adsorption @xcite , interfaces @xcite and transport @xcite .",
    "however , the crystallization issue was only addressed in one - component yukawa systems ( for a recent work , see e.g. @xcite ) but never in binary mixtures .",

    "the debye - hckel screened coulomb interaction is a reasonable model for confined charged colloids @xcite .",
    "crystallization of binary charged colloids has been studied experimentally in the bulk . however , a monolayer of a confined binary mixture of charged colloids has not yet been realized although this is in principle possible as has been shown for sterically - stabilized @xcite and magnetic colloids @xcite . on the other hand , sheets of highly charged dust particles in plasmas ( so - called complex plasmas )",
    "can also be confined to two dimensions , e.g.   by levitating electric fields .",
    "the interaction between the dust particles is again screened such that a yukawa model is appropriate @xcite .",
    "highly charged microspheres suspended in a plasma settled in a horizontal monolayer were studied experimentally and compared to a two - dimensional yukawa model @xcite .",
    "there is no principle problem in studying binary mixtures of dust particles but a concrete realization in an experiments still has to be performed as well .    apart from its important realizations , our major motivation for our studies is to understand the interplay between the interparticle interaction and the stability of different two - dimensional crystal lattices . a control of colloidal composite lattices may lead to new photonic crystals @xcite to molecular - sieves @xcite and to micro- and nano - filters with desired porosity @xcite .",
    "the electric properties of a nanocrystal depend on its superlattice structure @xcite . for these type of applications , it is crucial to understand the various stable lattice types in binary mixtures .",

    "furthermore , in contrast to situations where the pair potential can be described as a power low of the separation distance ( as it was the case in our previous work on dipolar mixtures @xcite ) , the phase diagram becomes pressure dependent for yukawa systems . to capture this feature , we present results at three well distinct pressures , namely @xmath67 and 100 .",

    "[ fig : pd_yuk](c ) . given the fact that at weak screening the yukawa pair potential is well approximated by a @xmath84 dependence , which is even softer than @xmath83 , it is legitimate to expect stable mixtures in the regime of weak screening and charge asymmetry . in order to check this idea",
    "we have performed additional calculations at @xmath85 with @xmath86 leading to reduced screening strengths of the order of @xmath87 .",
    "those values for @xmath88 turn out to be still too large to recover the phase behavior found at @xmath83-pair interactions @xcite . the consideration of even much smaller screening strengths ( say roughly of the order of @xmath89 ) are numerically not tractable within reasonable cpu time .",
    "unfortunately , the implementation of a direct lekner and/or ewald sum for the @xmath84-pair interactions is delicate at _ prescribed pressure _ , since the lack of electroneutrality involves the presence of an artificial homogeneous neutralizing background which is thermodynamically only consistent at _ prescribed density _ @xcite . consequently , although we have a strong intuition about the stability of mixtures at weak charge asymmetry and screening , we can not prove it here on computational basis .",
