    "in recent years , various constituent quark potential models have been proposed to describe the intrinsic structure of baryons .",
    "typical examples of the models are the igsur - karl model @xcite , the capstic and isgur relativized model @xcite , the chiral model @xcite and the hypercentral constituent quark model ( hcqm ) @xcite . various baryon properties , such as baryon spectroscopy , nucleon form factors and the transverse and the longitudinal electromagnetic transition amplitudes of @xmath7 and @xmath8 stars resonances , have been systematically calculated with the hcqm @xcite . in this work",
    ", we will present calculations of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors and nucleon-@xmath0 electromagnetic transition amplitudes based on the framework of the hypercentral constituent quark model with a meson cloud .",
    "particularly , we shall stress the corrections due to the pion meson cloud . in our calculation ,",
    "a baryon is considered as a three - quark core surrounded by the pion meson cloud .",
    "thus , we have new degrees of freedom in addition to the conventional three constituent quarks .",
    "the hypercentral constituent quark model @xcite contains a linear plus a coulomb - like potential @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hyperradius defined in terms of the standard jacobi coordinates and .",
    "it should be mentioned that this hypercentral potential has the following features .",
    "first of all , it contains three - body force effects .",
    "secondly , it can be considered as the hypercentral approximation of a two - body potential of the form linear plus coulomb , as suggested by lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "thirdly , its predictions of the proton form factors decrease as powers of the virtual photon momentum , while the form factors of the conventional harmonic oscillator potential decrease as gaussians .",
    "finally , its predictions for the transition amplitudes @xmath11 of @xmath12 and @xmath13 resonances @xcite agree with the data , particularly in the momentum transfer region of @xmath14 .",
    "the hypercentral model contains also a standard hyperfine interaction fitted to the @xmath15 mass difference and in this form it has been employed for the calculation of various baryon properties @xcite .",
    "however it has been shown that a good description of the lower part of the spectrum and of the transition amplitudes can be obtained also using simply the hyper - coulomb ( hyc ) potential to which a linear and a spin - dependent interactions are added as perturbations @xcite .",
    "thus , for the low - lying resonance states it is a good approximation to simply take the space wave functions of the hyc potential instead of the ones coming from the numerical solution of the linear plus coulomb potentials with hyperfine interaction .",
    "to take the pion meson cloud effects into account , one may consider the following lagrangian density with a @xmath16 coupling ( similar to the @xmath17 case ) @xcite @xmath18 from eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) the conserved local electromagnetic current can be derived using the principle of minimal coupling @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the charge carried by the field upon which the derivative operator acts .",
    "the total electromagnetic current @xmath21 is then @xmath22 where @xmath23.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because of the @xmath16 coupling , a physical baryon state can be described as a superposition of a three - quark core and its surrounding pion cloud ,    @xmath24 \\left|a_0\\right > , \\label{z2a }     \\ ] ]    where @xmath25 is the bare baryon probability in the physical baryon state , @xmath26 is the projection operator projecting out all the components of @xmath27 with at least one pion , and @xmath28 is the interaction hamiltonian which describes the process of emission and absorption of pions , which can be obtained from the lagrangian density with the @xmath16 coupling , eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) @xcite .",
    "our numerical calculations of the elastic nucleon form factors and of the @xmath15 electromagnetic transition amplitudes are performed with the analytical model of ref . @xcite without the spin - spin interaction and with the explicit inclusion of the pion cloud corrections .",
    "we set the parameters for the hcqm potential as @xmath29 , @xmath30 @xcite and @xmath31 ( corresponding to the usual @xmath17 coupling constant @xmath32 ) .",
    "moreover , we also take the results of the conventional harmonic oscillator potential with @xmath33 ( corresponding to a wave function with radius of the order of @xmath34 ) for a comparison . to calculate the electromagnetic interaction between the photon and the nucleon with the pion meson cloud",
    ", we consider the following couplings : photon - quark , photon - quark with the pion meson cloud in flight , and photon - charged pion . fig . 1 illustrates the three couplings between the photon and the nucleon or the @xmath35 with the pion meson cloud .     and",
    "@xmath36 are here restricted to the @xmath37 and @xmath35.,width=566 ]     for the hyc case.,title=\"fig:\",width=283,height=283 ]   for the hyc case.,title=\"fig:\",width=283,height=283 ]",
    "as shown in eq . [ z2a ] , a baryon wave function contains a three - quark core component and a three - quark core plus a pion meson cloud component .",
    "one can directly calculate the three - quark core probability @xmath25@xcite . for the nucleon",
    ", we have @xmath38 in the hyc potential and @xmath39 in the classical ho potential .",
    "our result for @xmath40 is @xmath41 in hyc potential and @xmath42 in the ho potential .",
    "the probability of the pion meson in the ho potential is larger than that in the hyc potential .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the pionic contribution is competing with that of the quark core and a smaller r.m.s radius means a stronger pion coupling .",
    "figure [ pf ] shows the obtained proton electromagnetic form factors compared with the experimental data .",
    "we use the hyc wave function as the wave function of the nucleon .",
    "figure [ pf ] also shows different contributions from fig . 1 to the proton form factors ( see the insets in the top right corner of figs.(2a ) and ( 2b ) ) .",
    "in the small @xmath43 region , the contribution of the @xmath44 interaction is more than @xmath45 and as @xmath43 increases it decreases quickly .",
    "when @xmath43 is beyond @xmath46 the contribution nearly vanishes .",
    "one finds that the contribution of the pion meson cloud is important especially in the low @xmath43 region and also one can draw the conclusion that for the proton form factors the hypercentral constituent quark model can give a better prediction than that of the ho model .    .",
    "[ nf ]    our results for the neutron electromagnetic form factors are shown in figure [ nf ] . for the magnetic form factor",
    "the hyc gives a better prediction , however for the electric form factor the result of the hyc wave function is smaller than the experimental data .",
    "it is also smaller than that of ho potential since the pionic contribution in the hyc potential is smaller and the non - zero value of the neutron charge distribution in the present calculation results from the pionic contribution .",
    "it should be stressed that here we have not considered the hyperfine mixing .",
    "we know that spin - spin forces lead to configuration mixing ; for example , the octet wave function @xmath47 not only gets contribution from the octet @xmath48 but also from @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this mixing gives rise to a non - zero electric form factor of the neutron .",
    "it is expected that the mixing effect has to be taken into account for a further analysis of the neutron charge form factor in order to get a better result in comparison with the experimental data     and ( b ) @xmath51 ( b ) of the @xmath0 resonance with the different contributions of fig .",
    "[ feynman ] .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=283,height=283 ]   and ( b ) @xmath51 ( b ) of the @xmath0 resonance with the different contributions of fig .",
    "[ feynman ] .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=283,height=283 ]    figures [ helicity ] ( a ) and [ helicity](b ) show the real part of the individual contribution to the helicity amplitudes @xmath52 and @xmath11 of the @xmath0 resonance respectively . as @xmath53 ,",
    "the hyc prediction of @xmath54 ( @xmath51 ) is @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) . comparing it to the result @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) without the pion meson cloud",
    ", we clearly see that the results with the pion meson cloud effects reproduce the experimental data @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) @xcite much better .",
    "it is clear that the contributions from the pion cloud are significant in the real photon point .",
    "another important observable in the @xmath15 transition is the ratio of @xmath61 .",
    "our result for it is -0.012",
    ". it reasonably agrees with the experimental value reported in particle data group @xmath62@xcite . if no meson cloud is considered , the ratio of the simple hcqm ( without the configuration mixing ) vanishes .",
    "our results show that the meson cloud effect also plays a role on this ratio .",
    "thus , we conclude that we are able to reproduce , at least partially , the experimental data of the @xmath15 transition in the low @xmath43 region with hcqm and with the pion meson cloud .",
    "in this work , we have studied the nucleon form factors and the form factors of @xmath63 transitions based on a hcqm with hyc wave function .",
    "the pion meson cloud effects are explicitly included and discussed . from our numerical results , one may conclude that the pion cloud contribution is crucial for a reasonable explanation of the measured nucleon form factors as well as of the helicity amplitudes of the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "certainly , the pion meson cloud mainly affects the observables in the low momentum transfer region . in the large momentum transfer region , we need the hypercentral constituent quark model in the relativized version @xcite , in addition to the inclusion of a perturbative pion cloud .",
    "it will also be important to explore the effect of @xmath64 violating admixtures in the baryon wave functions @xcite simultaneously , since the deformations of the nucleon and @xmath35 wave functions can also provide part of the e2/m1 ratio and part of the neutron charge form factor .",
    "finally , from the analysis of our results , we see that a hypercentral constituent quark potential model ( with a hyper - coulomb plus a linear confinement term and the hyperfine term ) together with the pion cloud corrections might be able to give a more reasonable description of the form factors of the nucleon and of the transition form factors of the @xmath0 .",
    "it is of great interest to see the pion meson cloud effects on the roper resonance and on the resonances @xmath12 and @xmath13 since the transition amplitude to the @xmath12 resonance can be well explained by the hypercentral constituent quark model in a large @xmath65 region .",
