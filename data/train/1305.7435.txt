    "positron emission tomography ( pet ) @xcite is an imaging technique capable of detecting picomolar quantities of a labelled tracer with temporal resolution of the order of seconds .",
    "fdg - pet is a pet modality in which [ @xmath0f]fluoro-2-deoxy - d - glucose ( fdg ) is used as a tracer to evaluate glucose metabolism and to detect diseases in many different organs @xcite . from a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "pet ( and , specifically , fdg - pet ) experiments involve two kinds of problems .",
    "first , signal processing techniques are applied to reconstruct the time dependence of location and concentration of tracer from the measured radioactivity .",
    "second , these dynamic pet data can be processed to estimate physiological parameters that describe the functional behaviour of the inspected tissues .",
    "the present paper focuses on this second aspect and , specifically , examines fdg - pet data from liver ( and gut ) , corrected for radioactive decay , to recover information on glucose metabolism .",
    "the synthetic data processed within the paper have been created mimicking the acquisition of a pet device for small animals ( mice ) .",
    "the analysis of tracer kinetics in the hepatic system , as in general in tissues whose activities have been measured with fdg - pet , is based on compartmental models @xcite .",
    "this conceptual framework identifies different compartments in the physiological system of interest , each one characterized by a specific ( and homogeneous ) functional role . as any other tracer ,",
    "fdg is injected into the system with a concentration mathematically modeled by the so - called time activity curve ( tac ) . the time dependent concentrations of tracer in each compartment constitute the state variables that can be determined from pet data .",
    "the time evolution of the state variables ( the kinetics of the system ) is modeled by a linear system of ordinary differential equations for the concentrations , expressing the conservation of tracer during flow between compartments .",
    "the ( constant ) micro - parameters describing the input / output rates of tracer for each compartment are called _ exchange coefficients _ or _ rate constants _ , represent the physiological parameters describing the system s metabolism , and are the unknowns to be estimated .    under the assumption",
    "that the exchange coefficients are given , the differential equations for the state variables in each compartment can be solved straightforwardly . if instead the exchange coefficients are unknown , we consider the formal expressions for the concentration time dependence involving the rate coefficients , and we compare them with the experimental data in order to optimize the unknown parameters .",
    "the data are given as total concentrations ( e.g. , inside liver ) which are obtained by on drawing regions of interest ( rois ) of the organ of interest at different time points and dividing the total activity by the corresponding volume .",
    "in addition to such general features , modelling of tracer flow inside liver implies a second difficulty , arising from physiology , in that the blood supply ( and hence the tracer supply ) comes from both hepatic artery and portal vein .",
    "while tracer concentration in the hepatic artery can be estimated by drawing rois on the left ventricle at different times , the portal vein is not accessible to rois . in the literature",
    "there have been many attempts to deal with this dual input problem @xcite . in this paper the input of tracer through the hepatic vein is estimated by the analysis of tracer flow in gut which is performed by means of an appropriate compartment modelling , where trapping of tracer is explicitly considered .",
    "the related experimental data are obtained from measurements of activity on rois drawn on the gut .",
    "once the exchange coefficients have been determined , tracer concentrations in compartments inside gut are reconstructed , and the concentration of outgoing tracer through the hepatic vein is evaluated by application of a related balance equation .    from a methodological viewpoint ,",
    "the inverse problem of determining the unknown exchange coefficients is solved by applying an ant colony optimization ( aco ) technique @xcite , which is a statistical optimization algorithm inspired by evolutionary strategies . in our application",
    "we minimize the discrepancy between the experimental concentrations and the already mentioned analytical forms provided by the solutions of the forward problems , taking also into account the blood fraction with which the vascular system of the liver is fed up .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the systems of differential equations modelling the tracer flow",
    "inside gut and liver are described and formally solved for the concentrations in terms of the rate constants .",
    "section 3 describes aco . in section 4",
    "the exchange coefficients are determined starting from synthetic data .",
    "our conclusions are offered in section 5 .",
    "the compartmental models used in this paper are described in figure [ fig : gut - liver ] .",
    "tracer from arterial compartment enters the gut and the liver systems .",
    "it leaves the gut system , goes first into the portal vein and then into the liver .",
    "capital @xmath1 denotes each concentration ( bq min@xmath2 ) and the related suffixes identify the corresponding compartment .",
    "in particular @xmath3 and @xmath4 refer to arterial and venous compartment .",
    "gut includes the two compartments of concentration @xmath5 and @xmath6 of free and trapped tracer , while liver contains the two compartments of concentration @xmath7 and @xmath8 of free and metabolized tracer , respectively .",
    "the constant exchange coefficients between compartments in contact are denoted as @xmath9 ( min@xmath2 ) , where the suffixes @xmath3 and @xmath10 denote the target and source compartment , respectively . for example , @xmath11 is the rate constant of tracer carried `` to '' the free gut tissue @xmath12 `` from '' the arterial blood @xmath3 .",
    "we assume @xmath13 for all cases .",
    "the usual conditions for compartmental analysis hold , e.g. , tracer is uniformly distributed in each compartment at each instant , diffusive effects are neglected and physiological processes are in a steady state",
    ". moreover , the kinetic process in the system is initialized by the tac @xmath14 representing the tracer concentration in arterial blood .",
    "accordingly , the initial values of the remaining concentrations vanish . in the following subsections",
    "we analyze tracer flow from gut , portal vein and the liver .",
    "the output from gut is the input for @xmath15 and @xmath15 is one of the two inputs of the liver .",
    "the state variables of the two - compartment model adopted for the gut in this paper are the free tracer concentration in tissue ( @xmath16 ) and the trapped tracer concentration ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "conservation of tracer exchanged between compartments leads to the following system of linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients : @xmath18 with initial conditions @xmath19 and where the dependence on time is implicit .",
    "+ let us define @xmath20 then the solution of the cauchy problem ( [ eq : system_gut ] ) is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 @xmath23 denotes the convolution operator , @xmath24 are the eigenvalues of the coefficients matrix , and the constants @xmath25 and @xmath26 are defined as @xmath27 under the assumption of non vanishing denominator .",
    "we represent the portal vein as a compartment with tracer concentration @xmath15 and volume @xmath28 placed between the gut and liver systems .",
    "the input flow from gut is described as @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the flow of carrier fluid per unit time , in analogy with the notation for the exchange coefficients .",
    "the outgoing flow of tracer towards liver is @xmath31 where conservation of the carried fluid is explicitly considered .",
    "the balance equation for tracer takes the form @xmath32 division by @xmath28 yields @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 . solving the differential equation ( [ eq : cons_tr ] ) for vanishing initial value of @xmath15 leads to @xmath36 this provides tracer concentration of portal vein .",
    "+      we refer to figure [ fig : gut - liver ] , with the observation that there is no flow of tracer from the metabolized compartment to the blood circulation out of the liver , that is @xmath37 . following the analogy with the analysis of the gut system , we find that the concentrations @xmath7 and @xmath8 inside the liver solve the system of linear ordinary differential equations @xmath38 where @xmath39=@xmath40+@xmath41 is known .",
    "+ the solution of the cauchy problem with the vanishing initial conditions takes the form @xmath42 with @xmath43      the model equations ( [ eq : gut_sol ] ) and ( [ eq : liver_sol ] ) describe the time behavior of the tracer concentration in the gut and the liver systems in terms of the tac of the arterial concentration and exchange coefficients .",
    "given such equations we have to determine the tracer coefficients by utilizing measuraments of the total tracer concentrations in gut and liver provided by nuclear imaging and applying an optimization scheme for the solution of the inverse problem .",
    "analysis of pet images on gut rois provides the total tracer concentration @xmath44 in gut at different time points .",
    "similarly , rois on the liver provide the total tracer concentration @xmath45 in liver at the same time points .",
    "the optimization problems we have to solve are the ones to minimize @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the blood volume fractions inside gut and liver respectively ( in the following we will assume @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "we have also taken the estimate that the ingoing flux of venous blood is about 3/4 of total flux while arterious blood is the remaining 1/4 @xcite .",
    "the minimization of the functionals @xmath52 and @xmath53 is realized by means of an ant colony optimization ( aco ) scheme @xcite .",
    "aco is a statistical - based optimization method developed in the 1990s with the aim of providing a reliable although not optimal solution to some non - deterministic polynomial - time hard combinatorial optimization problems . while an ant is going back to the nest",
    "after having taken some food , it releases a pheromone trace that serves as a trail for next ants , which are able to reach food detecting pheromone . since the pheromone decays in time , its density is higher if the path to food is shorter and more crowded ; on the other hand , more pheromone attracts more ants and at the end all ants follow the same trail .",
    "this behavior is paraphrased in aco identifying the cost functional with the length of the path to food , and the pheromone traces with a probability density which is updated at each iteration depending on the value of the cost function for a set of states .    in practice , at each iteration , the cost function is evaluated on a set of @xmath54 admissible states , and the states are ordered according to increasing values of the cost function .",
    "then aco defines a probability distribution which is more dense in correspondence with the cheaper states and , on its basis , @xmath55 new states are extracted .",
    "a comparison procedure identifies the new best @xmath54 states which form the next set of states .",
    "formally the starting point of the algorithm is a set of @xmath54 states @xmath56 such that @xmath57 that are ordered in terms of growing cost , namely , @xmath58 .",

    "the procedure generates @xmath55 new states @xmath67 , enlarging the set @xmath68 to @xmath69 if @xmath70 are the @xmath55 states of @xmath71 of greater cost , the updated @xmath68 is defined as @xmath72 this procedure converges to an optimal solution of the problem by exploiting the fact that the presence of the weights @xmath73 , in the definition of @xmath66 , gives emphasis to solutions of lower costs since @xmath74 this fact , associated with the influence that a proper choice of parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 has on the shape of the gaussian functions , determines the way in which the method tunes the impact of the worse and best solutions .",
    "the algorithm ends when the difference between any two states of @xmath68 is less than a pre - defined quantity or when the maximum allowable number of iterations is reached .",
    "the initial set @xmath68 of trial states is chosen by sampling a uniform probability distribution .",
    "the implementation of aco for the optimization of the exchange coefficients in @xmath77 and @xmath78 is based on the following steps :    1 .",
    "the four aco parameters are fixed as follows .",

    "the values of the tracer coefficients are initialized to six random numbers picked up in the interval @xmath81 .    in the following section",
    "we show how this statistics - based compartmental analysis works in the case of synthetic data . in this specific application",
    "the advantages of aco with respect to deterministic optimization are that it does not suffer local minima and singularities in the functional gradient .",
    "in order to validate the compartmental model described in section 2 and the numerical method for its reduction described in section 3 we have utilized synthetic data simulated by mimicking the behavior of a real micro - pet system ( see picture in figure [ fig : mouse ] ) .    1 .",
    "the input function @xmath82 has been constructed by using the golish function @xcite @xmath83 where the parameters @xmath84 have been determined by fitting this model against experimental values obtained by means of a real experiment performed under very controlled conditions ; 2 .",
