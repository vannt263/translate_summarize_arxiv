    "a treatment of disorder is an essential part of the theory of superconductivity .",
    "after all , one must explain why impurity scattering does not cause resistance .",
    "thus it is natural that as evidence for novel superconducting states multiplies the foundations of the subject , due mainly to anderson @xcite and abrikosov and gorkov@xcite , are being re - examined .",
    "the experiments which stimulate most strongly the current revival of interest in the problem are those on the high temperature superconductors@xcite , which are now universally regarded as ` @xmath1wave superconductors'@xcite , and those involving some of the heavy fermion systems which display signs of ` @xmath5wave ' pairing@xcite . in what follows",
    "we wish to contribute to the theoretical discussion @xcite of the issues raised by these very interesting developments .",
    "the case of classic , ` @xmath0wave ' , superconductors is by now well understood .",
    "if the perturbation does not break time reversal symmetry and the coherence length is sufficiently long , so that the pairing potential @xmath6 does not fluctuate , the anderson theorem@xcite guarantees that there is an absolute gap in the quasi - particle spectrum and the main effect of disorder is that the density of normal states in the gap equation is replaced by its average over configurations@xcite . on the other hand",
    "if the perturbation breaks time reversal invariance , as is the case with paramagnetic impurities , the effect is more dramatic .",
    "for instance , the transition temperature @xmath7 is reduced from its clean limit value @xmath8 , according to the well known pair - breaking formula :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the digamma function and @xmath11 is a measure of the strength of the scattering and @xmath12 is the scattering rate@xcite .",
    "by contrast in the case of superconductors whose cooper pairs are of exotic ` @xmath5wave ' or ` @xmath1wave ' character even simple potential scattering , which does not break time reversal symmetry , causes pair breaking@xcite .",
    "this fact was noted already in the early contributions to the field@xcite , but has become a subject of intense scrutiny only recently@xcite .",
    "of particular interest are two dimensional models featuring ` @xmath1wave ' pairing as these may be relevant to experiments on high @xmath3 superconductors .",
    "notably , for cuprates many experiments have explored the variation of @xmath3 , the density of states and other properties as a function of ni and zn substitutions on the copper sites@xcite or irradiation damage@xcite .",
    "although a wide variety of theoretical ideas@xcite and methods@xcite have been applied to interpret the experiments a comprehensive picture of the role of disorder is far from complete . on a more formal level",
    ", an intriguing problem arises from the observation of gorkov and kalugin@xcite that the scattering in models where the order parameter has a line of zeros on the fermi surface is highly singular and this may be a manifestation of interesting new physics . indeed in 2-d ,",
    "et al._@xcite predict that the quasi particle density of states n(e ) approaches zero , even in the disordered state , as power low , @xmath13 , with positive exponent @xmath14 , instead of going to a finite value    @xmath15    where @xmath16 measures strength of the interaction , as was found by gorkov and kalugin@xcite .",
    "another interesting and controversial issue is the relative importance of the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) and resonant scattering in the unitarity limit@xcite .",
    "our aim here is to explore the subject systematically on the bases of explicit calculations , albeit for a simple , extended hubbard model with attractive interactions and site diagonal randomness only .    in short",
    "we will examine the problem of disordered unconventional superconductors making use of the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) .",
    "the cpa is the most reliable approximation developed for the theory of electronic structure of random metallic alloys in the normal state@xcite .",
    "notably it has been shown to be exact in both the weak and the strong scattering limits , and applicable to systems with low as well as high concentration of impurities .",
    "significantly , the cpa reduces to the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) for weak scattering impurities , and agrees with the self - consistent t - matrix approximation ( scta ) results for strongly scattering impurities of low concentrations .",
    "indeed it remains a good approximation in the unitarity limit of resonant scattering@xcite . finally , on account of the fact that it becomes exact as the number of nearest neighbors goes to infinity ,",
    "the cpa is often referred to as a mean field theory of disorder@xcite .",
    "given these desirable features it is clearly worthwhile to explore the consequences of the cpa for disordered superconductors .",
    "for the case of conventional @xmath0wave pairing this has already been done , generating many useful results@xcite . apart from our earlier brief report@xcite and the limited discussion in ref . , the case of superconductors with cooper pairs of @xmath1 symmetry will be treated here , within cpa , for the first time .",
    "we will describe fully our numerical method , demonstrate that in various limits our formalism reproduces many of the well known results for disordered superconductors , and examine in detail the phase diagram of the local and non - local attractive two - dimensional hubbard models .",
    "in particular we study the variations of @xmath3 with impurity scattering strength and with impurity concentration for the case of local @xmath0wave pairing as well as non - local ( extended ) @xmath0wave and @xmath1wave pairing .",
    "we also contrast the cases for a binary alloy , a - b type , disorder with the case of uniformly distributed scattering potentials on each site .",
    "finally , we investigate the dos , @xmath17 , at low energies and its consequences for measurements of the specific heat , comparing our results with those of kalugin and gorkov@xcite , eq .",
    "[ eqwenger ] , and of nereseyan , tsvelik and wenger @xcite .",
    "our starting point is the single band hubbard model with an attractive extended interaction which is described by the following hamiltonian    @xmath18    where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are , respectively , the usual creation and annihilation operators for electrons on site @xmath21 with spin @xmath22 , and the local charge operator is @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",

    "( [ eq : h ] ) we apply the hartree - fock - gorkov @xcite approximation , which results in the following bogoliubov de gennes equation :    @xmath32    for the greens function matrix @xmath33 at the mastusbara frequency , @xmath34 . for computational convenience",
    "we shall take the hopping integral @xmath26 to be non zero only when the sites @xmath21 and @xmath35 are nearest neighbors .",
    "the mean field pairing potential @xmath36 can either be local ( @xmath37 ) or nearest neighbor non - local , see fig . 1 , and couples particle and hole amplitudes between sites @xmath21 and @xmath35 .",
    "of course , the above equations are completed by the self - consistency condition that    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is a positive infinitesimal . to simplify matters",
    "we have assumed that the normal hartree and exchange terms can be absorbed into the definitions of the chemical potential , @xmath25 , or the hopping integrals @xmath26 . as usual , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bdge1 ] ) and ( [ eq : selfcon1 ] ) are to be solved subject to the requirement on the chemical potential that    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the average number of electrons per unit cell . clearly , the greens function matrix @xmath42 determined by the above equations depends on the set of site energies @xmath43 .",
    "our task is to find the configurationally averaged greens function matrix @xmath44 .",
    "evidently , this is made much easier if we assume that the pairing potential does not fluctuate from configuration to configuration . as was argued by gyorffy _",
    "et al._@xcite this is a good approximation when the t=0 coherence length @xmath45 is large .",
    "thus our results will have to be treated with appropriate care when applied to superconductors with short coherence length such as superconducting cuprates .",
    "let us now proceed to deploy the cpa strategy for calculating the averaged greens function matrix @xmath44 subject to the self consistency conditions :    @xmath46    @xmath47    the first move in deriving the fundamental equations of the coherent potential approximation is to define a coherent medium greens function matrix @xmath48 by    @xmath49    as will be clear latter @xmath50 and hence @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the diagonal components of the usual self - energy .",
    "note that we did not introduce any off diagonal self - energies such as @xmath53 and @xmath54 because for the single site perturbations of our model they are zero .",
    "the next step is to consider the scattering of the quasi - particles , propagating according to @xmath48 by the defects described by the potentials : @xmath55 where @xmath56 labels one of the @xmath57 different site energies we wish to consider .    in a straightforward application of the cpa principles,@xcite @xmath58 and therefore @xmath48",

    "the numerical methodology for calculating @xmath48 and @xmath58 closely follows that in ref . and",
    "is outlined in appendix a.    a number of recent studies of superconductors with unconventional pairing suggest that the consequences of disorder depend sensitively on the models used to describe the randomness.@xcite thus we are going to investigate two different models .",
    "the first corresponds to binary alloy disorder , where @xmath62 .",
    "namely we consider two _ types _ of sites with site energies @xmath63 and @xmath64 and concentrations of @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively .",
    "the second model is described by a uniform distribution of site energies . here",
    "we shall have in mind the limit where @xmath67 with @xmath68 $ ] .",

    "( [ eqkalugin ] ) . as is well known@xcite the pair breaking formula",
    "was first derived for magnetic impurities in @xmath0wave superconductors@xcite but it also applies in many other interesting circumstances such as our present concern , namely the case of non - magnetic impurities in @xmath1wave superconductors@xcite .    to derive it within the cpa",
    "let us start with the gap equation @xmath76    as a motivation for our argument we recall the method of abrikosov and gorkov@xcite for solving the gap equation at @xmath3 for a clean superconductor . in that case , to find @xmath3 we linearize the analogue of eq.([eq : gap1 ] ) by approximating the off diagonal greens function @xmath77 as follows :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 , and for our tight binding model with a square lattice @xmath80 .",

    "in the above equation the integral and the sum are divergent , so we need to introduce a cut - off , @xmath93 . in the usual way we assume the density of states @xmath94 is slowly varying up to the cut off energy ,",

    "we have compared and contrasted the effect of disorder on conventional @xmath0 and @xmath1wave superconductors on the bases of an extended , negative @xmath165 hubbard model and a mean field , cpa , treatment of disorder . on the one hand",

    "the use of cpa in describing disordered @xmath1wave superconductors is an advance in this very active field @xcite because it allows us to avoid the usually delicate choice between methods , sets of diagrams , designed to deal with either weakly or strongly scattering perturbations .",
    "the cpa treats both kinds of problems equally accurately and it is known to provide a very credible interpolation between the two@xcite .",
    "as an example where above feature of cpa may have a crucial role to play we recall the use of the resonant scatterer model in interpreting experimental data both on the cuprates @xcite and some heavy fermion systems.@xcite in short , note that in the impurity , @xmath246 , limit the self energy for the greens function describing an electron moving on a lattice , is given by @xmath247 where the @xmath2matrix is defined , in terms of the impurity ` potential ' @xmath248 , a real local shift in the site energy , as @xmath249 evidently @xmath250 is complex number with an amplitude :    @xmath251 and a phase , the phase shift @xmath252 , given by @xmath253    now , observe that while for weak scatterers @xmath254 for a resonant scatterer in the unitary limit , defined by @xmath255 , @xmath256 where @xmath257 .",
    "it is the above dramatic difference in the dependence of @xmath258 and @xmath259 on the density of states @xmath17 that the cited authors rely on in interpreting the relevant experimental data .",
    "evidently , since the individual scattering events described by the local @xmath2matrices are always treated exactly in the cpa , the cpa describes weak scatterers and resonant scatterers equally well .",
    "moreover , since it is a reliable approximation not only in the impurity limit , @xmath260 , but also for arbitrary concentrations it deals with resonance scatterers even when eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma_r ] ) no longer holds .",

    "although we have not specifically concentrated on this aspect of the method , the principle feature of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sigma_b ] ) and ( [ eq : sigma_r ] ) , namely the dependence of @xmath261 on @xmath262 , can be seen to be at work in our calculations of the previous section . to demonstrate this we have calculated @xmath170 and n(0 ) as functions of band filling , @xmath41 , in the most interesting region @xmath263 , and compared in fig .",
    "23 their relationships for weak and strong scatterers at @xmath127 . clearly , for weak scatterers @xmath264 , @xmath265 is a more or less linear function of @xmath100 as in eq .",

    "thus we conclude that the cpa employed in the calculation gives a reliable account of disorder in both the weak and strong scattering regimes .",
    "having listed the above desirable properties of the cpa we hasten to emphasize that it is a ` mean  field ' theory of disorder and , hence , does not describe such interesting phenomena as localization @xcite even in the normal state .",
    "@xcite consequently , our result that @xmath100 is finite for the smallest amount of disorder can not be taken as evidence against the conclusion that @xmath268 of nersesyan _",
    "et al._. @xcite as this originates from the divergence of the vertex corrections in perturbation series for @xmath168 we may conjecture that it has to do with localization effects not described by cpa .",

    "the recursion method@xcite was first used for solving the bogoliubov de gennes equation by annett and goldenfeld@xcite and litak _",
    "et al_@xcite . its use to implement cpa calculations was advocated by julien and mayo@xcite . here , as in reference,@xcite we made a combined use of these powerful methods to calculate the greens function matrix @xmath269 where the indices @xmath21 and @xmath35 denote sites , while @xmath14 and @xmath270 represent the particle or hole degree of freedom on each site .",

    "( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ eq:9 ] ) we have a formally exact representation of the greens functions .",
    "however in general both the tridiagonal representation of the hamiltonian , and the matrix continued fraction ( [ eq:7 ] ) will be infinite .",
    "in practice one can only calculate a finite number of terms in the continued fraction exactly . in the terminology of the recursion method it is necessary to _ terminate _ the continued fraction .",
    "@xcite    if we were to calculate up to and including @xmath275 and @xmath282 and then simply set subsequent coefficients to zero then the greens function would have @xmath283 poles along the real axis .",
    "the density of states would then correspond to a set of @xmath283 delta functions . in order to obtain accurate results it would be necessary to calculate a large number of exact levels , which would be expensive in terms of both computer time and memory .    as a more efficient alternative we choose to terminate the continued fraction using the extrapolation method , as used previously by litak , miller and gyrffy.@xcite we calculate the values for @xmath275 and @xmath276 exactly up to the first @xmath57 coefficients using the recursion method .",
    "then , noting the fact that the elements of the matrices @xmath275 and @xmath276 vary in a predictable manner,@xcite we extrapolate the elements of the matrices for a further @xmath146 iterations , where @xmath146 is usually very much greater than @xmath57 .",

    "we also need @xmath291 .    in performing our self - consistency calculation",
    "we can make use of the fact that @xmath292 just acts as a renormalization to @xmath293 ( see sec .",
