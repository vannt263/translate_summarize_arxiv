    "while extremely successful as a phenomenological model , cosmological inflation @xcite still lacks a microphysical description within a fundamental theory of quantum gravity , a crucial feature given its large sensitivity to physical effects close to the planck scale .",
    "this has motivated the search for inflaton candidates amongst the plethora of scalar fields present in string theory compactifications ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "brane - antibrane inflation @xcite is one of the most attractive scenarios in this context , given the geometrical origin of the inflaton as the interbrane separation and the possibility of computing its potential for a broad class of background spacetimes .",
    "inflation , however , does not seem to be generic in these systems .",
    "in flat space , for example , the interbrane separation required for achieving a sufficient number of e - folds exceeds the average size of the compact space @xcite . in more realistic scenarios ,",
    "brane interactions are considerably weakened by the strong warping produced by fluxes and other nonperturbative effects required to stabilize the extra - dimensional moduli @xcite .",
    "however , this typically leads to hubble scale inflaton masses , a symptom of the generic @xmath0-problem in supergravity models with f - term susy breaking .",
    "the inflaton potential receives nevertheless a variety of additional contributions from susy breaking effects in the overall compactification that may cancel this large mass and improve its flatness , although typically at the expense of some fine - tuning @xcite .",
    "warm inflation scenarios are generically free of the @xmath0-problem @xcite , with significant dissipative effects slowing down the inflaton s motion and leading to the production of radiation during inflation , in many cases avoiding the need to reheat the system @xcite .",
    "dissipation may be achieved in a two - stage mechanism , with the inflaton coupling to heavy fields that in turn decay into light degrees of freedom , sustaining a nearly - thermal radiation bath at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "this dissipation damps the inflaton s motion without spoiling the flatness of the potential through neither radiative nor thermal corrections if susy is softly broken and the temperature lies below the heavy mass threshold , with a sufficient number of e - folds requiring only moderately large multiplicities @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we show that warm inflation scenarios can be easily implemented in more realistic d@xmath5-brane constructions with additional branes of different dimensionality intersecting both the brane and the antibrane stacks .",
    "this introduces light matter at the intersections that may be copiously produced during inflation , damping the d - brane motion , through interactions which are mediated by heavy strings stretching between the brane and antibrane stacks , naturally implementing the two - stage dissipation mechanism .",
    "we illustrate this for a d3-@xmath6 system with additional d7-branes , which has been extensively studied in the context of the ads / cft correspondence ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a particular feature of these systems is the large field multiplicity that may be present during inflation , as brane - antibrane annihilation will naturally reduce the degrees of freedom to , for example , those found in the mssm or its grand unified theory ( gut ) extensions .",
    "although we restrict our analysis to flat space , where dissipation effects can be easily computed , we consider the potentials for which the @xmath0-problem is more severe , with additional effects typically flattening the potential , thus showing that warm inflation gives a robust solution to the @xmath0-problem in brane - antibrane inflationary scenarios .",
    "furthermore , this constitutes the first explicit implementation of warm inflation in the context of a uv - complete theory @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the basic dynamical mechanisms leading to warm inflation scenarios , outlining the main features of the two - stage dissipation mechanism . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe the inflationary dynamics in d3-@xmath6 systems , in particular discussing the effects of additional d7-branes .",
    "we describe the associated field content and interactions in sec .",
    "iv , where the corresponding dissipative coefficient is also computed . in sec .",
    "v we present our main results for warm brane - antibrane inflation in flat space . finally , in sec .",
    "vi , we discuss possible extensions to more realistic constructions and summarize the main conclusions of this work .",
    "warm inflation scenarios @xcite revisit an old proposal by l.  z.  fang @xcite that particle production may have significant effects in inflationary expansion . as later proposed by moss @xcite and yokoyama and maeda @xcite , this may be effectively implemented by introducing a friction term in the classical evolution of the inflaton field , @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the hubble parameter and @xmath10 the first derivative of the inflationary potential with respect to the inflaton field .",
    "encoding the interactions between the inflaton and light particles that may be produced and subsequently thermalized , such term acts as a source of radiation production : @xmath11 while inflation may only occur when radiation gives a subdominant contribution to the energy balance of the universe , i.e. @xmath12 , its effects on the inflationary dynamics may be significant when @xmath13 , which roughly translates into @xmath4 , assuming that thermalization occurs . in conventional or _",
    "supercooled _ scenarios , interactions are assumed to be sufficiently feeble so that the friction term only becomes significant after slow - roll inflation , as the inflaton field starts to oscillate quickly about the minimum of its potential , with particle production reheating the universe and providing a rapid transition to a radiation - dominated era . in warm inflationary scenarios , on the other hand , such a term may concur with hubble friction to permit slow - roll solutions and allow for a smooth transition to a radiation - dominated phase , offering solutions to both the @xmath0- and the graceful exit problems .",
    "in particular , in the slow - roll regime @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 , leading to the slow - roll conditions @xcite : @xmath16 where besides the conventional slow - roll parameters , one introduces @xmath17 to account for the field dependence of the dissipative coefficient . strong dissipation may then allow for a sufficiently large period of accelerated expansion with potentials that would otherwise be too steep .",
    "one must also ensure that radiation is produced at a rate that compensates for the inflationary redshift @xmath18 and also that thermal effects do not induce a large inflaton mass , which translates into the condition : @xmath19    in @xcite , berera and fang further suggested that the dynamics of the inflaton should be governed by a langevin equation including not only the dissipative term but also a noise force term that would drive inflaton fluctuations , specified uniquely by a fluctuation - dissipation theorem . the primordial spectrum seeding the large scale structure of the observed universe is then dominated by _",
    "thermal _ rather than vacuum fluctuations of the inflaton field , due to the interplay with the thermal bath at @xmath4 , giving @xcite @xmath20 where all quantities are evaluated at horizon crossing .",
    "the microscopical basis for warm inflation has been the focus of many studies in the literature , being first examined by berera , gleiser and ramos @xcite , which set the adiabatic approach to dissipation within quantum field theory that has been used in all subsequent studies .",
    "most models initially proposed considered all fields to be in a high - temperature phase , which raised some concerns on the models possible realizations within quantum field theory in @xcite and by yokoyama and linde @xcite , namely due to thermal effects spoiling the required flatness of the inflaton potential .",
    "successful models have , however , been constructed based on the two - stage dissipation mechanism proposed by berera and ramos @xcite , in which the inflaton is coupled to heavy mediator bosonic and fermionic fields , much heavier than the temperature of the universe during inflation , which could in turn decay into light degrees of freedom .",
    "the production of the heavy particles is thus boltzmann - suppressed , so that the particles are effectively in a zero - temperature state . in supersymmetric models , the leading quantum corrections",
    "will then cancel and hence maintain the flatness of the classical inflaton potential .",
    "supersymmetry is , however , ineffective in cancelling time nonlocal processes , thereby allowing for strong dissipative effects while suppressing dangerous radiative and thermal corrections . a generic superpotential realizing this two - stage mechanism is given by @xcite @xmath21 where the inflaton corresponds to the scalar component of the superfield @xmath22 , while the heavy mediators and the light radiation degrees of freedom are encoded in the bosonic and fermionic components of the superfields @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ warm_superpotential ] ) then leads to scalar masses @xmath25 , discarding the mass shifts induced by soft susy breaking during inflation , and couples the inflaton fluctuations to the heavy mediators .",
    "the cross term in @xmath26 then allows for the decay of the heavy fields into the light degrees of freedom .",
    "note that this precludes a direct decay of the inflaton into the light fields , which is crucial in keeping radiative corrections under control .",
    "thermal corrections in this setup were computed in @xcite and shown to give subleading contributions to the inflaton potential .",
    "the interactions arising from this type of superpotential yield , in the low - temperature regime @xmath27 , a leading dissipative coefficient of the form @xmath28 , with the constant parameter enhanced by the multiplicity of the heavy mediators and number of available decay channels , @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the simplest example of brane - antibrane inflation in type iib string theory corresponds to two stacks of @xmath30 d3-branes and @xmath31 @xmath6-branes spanning the noncompact directions 0123 and separated by a distance @xmath32 in a six - dimensional flat torus of volume @xmath33 . at large distances ,",
    "the two stacks interact mainly via the exchange of bulk massless modes , yielding a coulomb - like potential that can be computed e.g.  by treating the antibrane stack as a probe of the geometry produced by the d3-branes at the origin of the compact space , giving to leading order : @xmath34~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the string coupling , @xmath38 is the fundamental string length , @xmath39 is the reduced planck mass and @xmath40 is the inflaton field , with @xmath41 denoting the d3-brane tension . the @xmath6-branes backreaction may be neglected if @xmath42 for slowly moving branes @xcite , while the supergravity approximation holds for weak curvatures , @xmath43 , with the near - horizon curvature scale @xmath44 in the regime of interest to our discussion @xcite .",
    "this potential is characterized by a slow - roll parameter @xmath45 so that a sufficient number of e - folds can not be obtained in a supercooled scenario , given that @xmath46 in a compact space .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath47-brane s motion is conformally coupled @xcite , yielding a mass term @xmath48 that may dominate over the coulomb term .",
    "this leads to a hybrid potential with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , also precluding a large number of e - folds in a particular manifestation of the generic supergravity @xmath0-problem .",
    "as described in the previous section , successful realizations of warm inflation that could overcome the steepness of the inflaton potential require the existence of heavy mediatiors that catalyze the dissipative processes .",
    "this simple setup in fact includes heavy states coupled to the inflaton field , corresponding to massive strings stretched between the d3- and @xmath6-brane stacks and the mass of which is proportional to the interbrane distance .",
    "there are , however , no light matter particles into which these states may decay , being the lightest states charged under the gauge group of both branes .",
    "the existence of such light states is nevertheless required if one aims to incorporate the standard model or any of its extensions in the d3-branes that survive annihilation , once the brane - antibrane tachyonic instability @xcite ends inflation in a hybridlike fashion @xcite .",
    "this can be implemented , for example , by placing the stack of d3-branes at orbifold singularities and/or by including additional branes of different dimensionality @xcite .",
    "a simple extension of the d3-@xmath6 inflationary scenario is given by the inclusion of @xmath51 d7-branes wrapping e.g.  the 4567 compact directions , which introduces light matter particles corresponding to open strings attached to the latter and to each of the two d3-stacks . before analyzing the field content and interactions in this extended setup and how these may lead to realizations of warm inflation",
    ", one should first examine how the inflaton trajectory is modified in this setup .",
    "d7-branes source the type iib axio - dilaton field , so that one expects them to modify the constant dilaton profile of the d3-brane geometry .",
    "in fact , supergravity solutions combining d3- and d7-branes have been shown to exhibit a logarithmic dilaton profile near the d7-branes horizon , yielding a local string coupling @xcite : @xmath52^{-1}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 denotes the radial direction in the plane transverse to the d7-branes , with the d3-branes located at @xmath54 , with @xmath55 , and the d7-branes at @xmath56 , where the coupling vanishes .",
    "this modifies the potential energy of a mobile @xmath6-brane probing this geometry .",
    "in particular , as the brane tension is inversely proportional to the local string coupling , when placed randomly in the compact dimensions it will quickly move towards the origin along the @xmath53 direction in order to minimize its energy .",
    "the presence of the d7-branes thus selects a particular inflationary trajectory with both d3- and @xmath6-brane stacks separated along the d7-branes worldvolume at a distance @xmath57 from the latter . the potential is nevertheless given by eq .",
    "( [ inflaton_potential ] ) , with the inflaton field now corresponding to the interbrane separation @xmath32 along the compact directions wrapped by the d7-branes .",
    "let us first consider a setup with two concident d3-branes and @xmath51 d7-branes .",
    "this yields an @xmath58 worldvolume theory , described by a @xmath59 @xmath60 vector multiplet and an @xmath58 hypermultiplet . in @xmath61 language ,",
    "these include adjoint chiral multiplets @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath51 ( anti)fundamental chiral superfields @xmath64 corresponding to oriented open strings at the d3-d7 intersections , with a superpotential @xcite @xmath65+\\sqrt2g_{ym}\\tilde{q}\\phi_3q~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 correspond to the ( 45 ) , ( 67 ) and ( 89 ) coordinates , respectively , and @xmath67 @xcite . notice that , in particular , the scalar vacuum expectation value of @xmath68 determines the d3-d7 separation , which justifies its coupling to the ( anti)fundamental superfields .",
    "the gauge coupling on the d7-branes is suppressed by the volume of the compact cycle wrapped by the branes , so that d7-d7 strings will be irrelevant to our discussion .",
    "when the d3-branes , denoted by a and b , are separated along the compact directions , i.e.  by turning on a scalar vacuum expectation value for a linear combination of the @xmath62 fields , the gauge theory is broken to @xmath69 , under which the superfields may be decomposed as @xmath70 in this notation , the superfields @xmath71 correspond to the positions of each d3-brane in the compact space , while @xmath72 and @xmath73 correspond to both longitudinal and transverse excitations of the bifundamental strings stretched between the two branes , with both orientations .",

    "the @xmath83-term scalar potential then yields @xmath84 for the @xmath85 and @xmath86 scalar states , which as expected corresponds to the mass of open strings stretched between the d3-branes .",
    "these strings also describe the massive vector bosons of the broken gauge symmetry , which acquire an equal mass by incorporating the linear combination of the @xmath87 and @xmath88 scalar components that corresponds to longitudinal excitations of the open strings .",
    "the orthogonal linear combination also obtains a mass @xmath89 from d - terms in the scalar potential , completing the massive vector multiplet resulting from the supersymmetric higgs mechanism .",
    "notice that an inflationary scenario requires one of the d3-branes to be replaced with an antibrane so that supersymmetry is softly broken , which translates into shifting the @xmath72 and @xmath73 scalar masses in opposite directions , while keeping the corresponding fermion masses unchanged , with @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "this shift is negligible for large brane separations and only becomes significant at the end of inflation as @xmath91 .",
    "it is thus clear that the interactions in eq .",

    "the latter couple to the @xmath95 fields but not to the inflaton , and remain light for @xmath96 .",
    "field multiplicities are enhanced in the non - abelian case , with @xmath97 and @xmath98 , thus allowing for strong dissipative effects .",

    "although this precludes a perturbative treatment of the radiation fluid in both the d3 and @xmath6 sectors , we expect interactions to be strong enough to sustain the required near - thermal equilibrium at @xmath4 .",

    "one could alternatively envisage multistage scenarios with a few smaller d3-@xmath6 stacks yielding smaller dissipative effects , such that each pair provides only a fraction of the total number of e - folds .",
    "this would , for example , relax the need for @xmath125 coincident d3-branes with a dominant coulomb - like potential , although a smaller number of branes is nevertheless expected in more realistic scenarios .    as some amount of radiation is produced during inflation , warm scenarios",
    "may avoid the need for an efficient reheating through tachyon condensation , which may also be delayed by finite temperature effects @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dissipative @xmath23 fields that become tachyonic at the end of inflation are naturally coupled to radiation and one expects a significant fraction of the inflaton s energy density to be transferred into the surviving branes , so that the reheating temperature is not necessarily the same as the temperature during warm inflation .",
    "our analysis shows that dissipative effects are a natural feature of intersecting brane models that greatly alleviates the @xmath0-problem in brane - antibrane inflation .",
    "we expect this to significantly reduce the fine - tuning of geometrical parameters and initial conditions in stabilized compactifications , a topic we will explore in future work .",
