    "the actinide series of elements and their compounds  @xcite exhibit unusual but similar properties related to the collective states of their strongly correlated electrons .",
    "as one moves across this row of the periodic table , electron - electron correlations increase until , at am , the 5@xmath0 electrons localize .",
    "uranium is interesting , since it is believed to be in the normal itinerant ( band - structure - like ) limit , where correlations may be slightly larger than usual , but do not change the fundamental metallic nature of the material .",
    "nonetheless , there are tantalizing hints ( anomalies ) that correlations are still playing an important role in this material . for example , the specific heat enhancements are significantly large compared with band - structure calculations ( see below ) , and the phonon spectra is strongly and anomalously softened at high temperatures  @xcite .",
    "for this reason it is important to explore the experimental electronic structure of u in detail and to compare with band - structure calculations in order to assess exactly how correlated u is with respect to other actinide metals . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the correlations of u , while somewhat strong , may yet be weak enough to be tractable by modern many - body techniques such as dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite and may be far easier to understand than more strongly correlated materials like pu .",
    "however , the first step in this process is to establish high - quality photoemission spectra for very good single crystals and compare these results with band - structure calculations in order to provide a reliable baseline for whatever correlations are present .",
    "this paper provides preliminary results in this direction .",
    "uranium , the heaviest natural element , exists in three allotropes and has a complex phonon spectrum  @xcite and electronic structure .",
    "unusual properties of uranium also include anisotropic thermal expansion  @xcite , the occurrence of three charge - density wave ( cdw ) transitions  @xcite below 43  k , and strongly temperature - dependent elastic moduli  @xcite .",
    "aside from the low - temperature cdw transitions , the ground - state structure for uranium is orthorhombic ( @xmath1-u ) . upon heating",
    ", @xmath1-u transforms into a tetragonal structure ( _ _ t__@xmath2 = 935  k ) and finally crystallizes to a body - centered cubic phase ( _ _ t__@xmath3 = 1045  k ) prior to melting at 1406  k , all at ambient pressure  @xcite .",
    "many of the unusual properties found in uranium , as with the other light actinides ( th - pu )  @xcite , are thought to be related to the delocalization of the partially filled u5f electronic states and their hybridization with the u6d-7s electronic states  @xcite .",
    "the u5f electrons participating in bonding have been shown in uranium intermetallics to exhibit magnetism and superconductivity  @xcite and show similar bonding behavior to the @xmath4 electrons in lanthanide and transition metals  @xcite .",
    "several photoemission experiments have been carried out on uranium  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these experimental studies often suffer from poor spectral resolution caused by either oxygen contamination or the use of samples created by metal deposition upon a substrate .",
    "thin - film deposition studies , although valuable , might not be truly representative of a bulk material .",
    "the electronic structure of thin films is influenced by the chemical interaction between the overlayer and the substrate . using large u single crystals and a thorough sputter - anneal regimen",
    ", we have overcome these difficulties .    in this paper",
    "we present valence - band photoemission spectra at hei and heii energy excitations for a very high - quality single crystal of u at 173k and compare these with the results of first principles calculation of the electronic structure using the generalized gradient approximation approach ( gga ) in the full - potential linearized - augmented - plane - wave ( flapw ) method , which includes local 6p orbitals to accommodate the low - lying 6p semicore states  @xcite . using xps",

    "this procedure grows the crystals directly in the @xmath1-phase and avoids the formation of high - temperature structures .",
    "the crystals ( as large as 10@xmath910@xmath91  mm@xmath10 ) collect on a stainless steel cathode as dendrites or thin parallelogram - shaped platelets .",
    "to remove any residual salt , the u crystals were cleaned with water and electropolished in h@xmath11po@xmath12 prior to the experiment .",
    "chemical analysis reports 40 ( atomic )  ppm c and 167 ( atomic )  ppm si as the only detectable impurities .    unlike previous u samples@xcite ,",
    "these crystals are easily bent , and small cross - section pieces can be deformed by rotating a necked region by hand through several turns without work hardening or weakening . because these crystals have no grain boundaries and few impurities , we suggest that this unique ductility is the result of a large number of potential twin planes of the orthorhombic structure , and the ability of the twin to move over millimeters  @xcite .",

    "the crystals were found to have a residual resistivity ratio of up to 315 , eight times higher than previously reported values  @xcite .",
    "we take the above as evidence that these are the highest quality single @xmath1-u crystals yet produced , and that they possess extremely low impurity concentration and minimal micro - structural defects .",
    "ultraviolet photoelectron spectra were recorded with a resolution of 28.5  mev using a perkin - elmer / physical electronics model 5600 esca system equipped with a monochromated al  _ _ k__@xmath1 ( 1486.6  ev ) , a specs uvs 300 ultraviolet lamp ( hei , @xmath13 = 21.21  ev , heii , @xmath13 = 40.81  ev ) , and a spherical capacitor analyzer .",

    "surface preparation for both spectroscopic and leed measurements consisted of repeated cycles of ar ion sputtering and annealing at 873  k. after preparation , the oxygen ( o1s ) and carbon ( c1s ) signals in the xps spectra , major contaminant indicators on metallic actinide surfaces , were below the detection limit ( @xmath16  1  at .",

    "[ fig:3 m ] we also present results from first - principles gga  wien2k@xcite electronic band - structure calculations .",
    "the theory is based upon the simple notion that only @xmath19 is conserved , and hence for normal photoemission all electronic states along the direction @xmath20 to z are present ( @xmath21 is not conserved ) .",
    "hence , the theoretical curve is a directional density of states ( ddos ) as a function of energy @xmath22 , which is calculated from @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the energy eigenvalue for @xmath25 , band - index @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the fermi function for electron occupancy , and @xmath18 is the fermi energy . in this formula we have used a dirac delta function for the contribution to the ddos for each band state . since we have only summed over 21 @xmath25-points between @xmath20 to z , it was necessary to broaden the delta function into a finite gaussian in order to draw a smooth curve .",
    "we used a full - width at half max of 28.5 mev for the gaussian ( the instrumental resolution of the experiment ) .",
    "the wiggles between -3.5 to -4.5 ev show the coarseness of our @xmath25-point grid versus gaussian width .",
    "if we wished to smooth out this part of the ddos , we could either increase the width of the gaussian or the number of @xmath25-points .    besides spectrometer resolution effects , each eigenvalue @xmath28-function should actually have a width representative of the lifetime of the hole state ( due to radiative and auger decay ) .",
    "the lifetime , which is of the order of @xmath29/width , should be increasingly shorter for higher binding energy ; a simple free - electron argument would give a gaussian width for each state of energy e proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "since it is very difficult to calculate hole lifetimes from first principles , we have not included this effect in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 m ] .",
    "the net effect of including lifetimes would be to progressively smear out all the theoretical features as one moved to higher binding energy ( below the fermi energy ) .",

    "we expect that these types of states ( especially near @xmath18 ) should show the largest effects due to electron - electron correlations that go beyond those included in lda ( or gga ) band - structure calculations . therefore , we argue that the theoretical peak near -0.6 ev likely corresponds to the experimental peak near -0.3 ev , and that the shift is likely a quasi - particle effect due to these additional electronic correlations .",
    "( this effect will be the subject of a forthcoming study in the dmft framework . ) the two remaining peaks ( at -0.1 and -2.2 ev ) appear at gaps in the conventional band structure ( see the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig:3n ] ) , and therefore are likely surface states of mainly @xmath0 and @xmath4 character , respectively .    to understand the relative intensities of the various peaks between the hei and heii spectra",
    "is somewhat complicated .",
    "according to band theory , the peaks in the spectra come from high projected densities of states , which arise from flat regions of the bands ( the flatter the bands the sharper the peak ) .",
    "in addition , because of cross section effects ( see below ) , any @xmath4-electron feature will be enhanced in the hei spectra and any @xmath0-electron feature will be enhanced in the heii spectra .",
    "in addition , we estimate that the electronic mean - free path is probably close to its minimum value for the heii spectra , and hence any surface state will be enhanced relative to bulk states for the heii spectra .",
    "since both spectra are normalized to the maximum intensity in the fermi - energy region and not absolute values , only relative peak heights within each spectra have meaning , and we can not compare absolute values between the two spectra . in addition , as discussed above , peaks at higher binding energy are due to electronic energy states that have much shorter lifetimes ( due to radiative decay and auger mechanisms ) , which broaden these states and lower the intensity of the peaks .    given the large number of factors in determining the relative height of each peak , only qualitative statements can be made : the peaks below -1.0 ev show up much more prominently in the hei spectra relative to the heii spectra , because the @xmath4 electron photoemission is enhanced .",
    "this can be seen from the atomic photoionization cross - sections  @xcite , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "note that the hei data strongly emphasize the @xmath4 electrons and the heii data the @xmath0 electrons .",
    "the -0.1 ev peak in the heii spectra is very enhanced . because this is likely a @xmath0-character surface state",
    ", there are several possible contributing factors to its strength : first , an @xmath0-electron surface state will have reduced hybridization and a high one - electron density of states .",
    "surface atoms have a smaller number of near neighbors , which causes a higher local dos for these atoms .",
    "correlation effects are likely to increase this dos . also , the @xmath0-electron cross sections are very strong for the heii spectra . secondly ,",
    "according to estimates for escape depth as a function of excited electron energy based on the universal curve@xcite , we believe that the inelastic mean free path of the excited electrons for the heii spectra should be near an absolute minimum and should thus be smaller than for the hei spectra , which should enhance surface state features in the heii spectrum .",
    "in contrast , the peak at -2.2 ev is likely a surface state with @xmath4 character . due to the interplay of the photoionization cross - sections ,",
    "the peak is emphasized in the hei spectrum and suppressed in the heii , the latter effect being enhanced by the fact that the spectra are normalized at the maximum intensity .    from our band - structure results for the total dos at the fermi energy , we can estimate the effective mass enhancement @xmath26 by comparing to specific - heat measurements .",
    "we find @xmath36 to be 0.55 , consistent with a previous calculation by skriver et al .",
    "our dos calculation is similar to those previously computed for @xmath1-u by wills and eriksson  @xcite , and pnicaud  @xcite .",
    "there are two general contributions to the effective - mass enhancement : electron - phonon and electron - electron .",

    "hybridization between 6p and 6d electrons is allowed via j - j coupling and is supported by applicable symmetry rules.@xcite studies involving density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite argue persuasively to include u6p electrons in the valence band , and the clear overlap of radial distribution functions for light actinides may increase the likelihood of such hybridization  @xcite .",
