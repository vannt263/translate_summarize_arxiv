    "_ kepler _ has provided incredible results on extrasolar planets and planetary systems , as well as on stellar astrophysics . after analyzing main - belt asteroids @xcite , here",
    "we continue the exploration of our own solar system by pushing the limits of the spacecraft and observing faint , trans - neptunian objects .",
    "the _ kepler _ spacecraft is equipped with a 0.95-m schmidt telescope and 42 imaging ccds , from which 38 are currently in operation . _ kepler _ was designed to be the most precise photometer in order to detect the transits of numerous small planets @xcite .",
    "it monitored approximately 170  000 targets in the lyra - cygnus field , at high ecliptic latitudes , almost continuously for four years during its primary mission .",
    "but after the failure of two reaction wheels the telescope permanently lost its ability to maintain that attitude . soon a new mission , called k2 , was initiated to save the otherwise healthy and capable space telescope @xcite .",
    "since then , _ kepler _ has been observing in shorter , 75-day - long campaigns along the ecliptic to balance the radiation pressure from the sun .",
    "the ecliptic fields include innumerable solar system objects , although most asteroids and planets cross the field - of - view quite quickly .",
    "tnos , in contrast , appear to move slowly around their stationary points , and can be observed for extended periods of time .",
    "the @xmath4 resolution of the ccds is sufficient to avoid confusion even for faint targets .",
    "but the observations posed various challenges for _ kepler_. even the brighter tnos are at the detection limit of the telescope ( @xmath5 ) , with an expected precision of a few tenths of a magnitude for a single long - cadence ( 30-min ) observation .",
    "moreover , tnos exhibit quadratically increasing proper motions away from the stationary points .",
    "since the pixel mask allocation is fixed for an entire campaign , the whole length of the orbital arc has to be observed continuously . despite these challenges ,",
    "the k2 mission is in a unique position to gather continuous tno light curves in white light .",
    "the rotational light curve of small bodies in the solar system is determined by the shape and albedo variegations on the surface of the target , and provides information on these important characteristics .",
    "in addition , the collisional history of these bodies is stored in the spin state of the objects , probing different eras of the solar systems s debris disk evolution depending on the size .",
    "the largest objects ( @xmath6 or larger in diameter ) decoupled early from collisional evolution of the debris disks , therefore their rotation should reflect the cumulative effect of collisions during the formation period .",
    "medium size objects ( @xmath7 ) likely avoided catastrophic impacts with a rotation affected by smaller past events , while the smallest bodies ( @xmath8 ) are probably remnants of several collisions during the evolution of the solar system s debris disc ( for more details , see also * ? ? ? * ) .    in order to study the rotational properties of tnos we proposed a pilot study for k2 campaign  1 to observe the object ( @xmath9 ) with a small pixel mask for a limited time around the stationary point ( proposal i d : go1064 )",
    "the field of campaign  2 included multiple moderately bright targets from which ultimately only ( @xmath10 mag ) was selected for observation ( proposal ids go2066 and go3053 ) .",
    "for a rectangular , @xmath11-pixel mask was allocated by the guest observer office that included the object for 16  days around its stationary point , but 2.8  days were lost to a mid - campaign data download period . in contrast , was covered with a long arc constructed from a mosaic of 661 small ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) pixel masks , but the region of the stationary point itself fell off silicon .",
    "this caused a @xmath14 long gap in the observations , separating the data into a @xmath15 and a @xmath16 long section .",
    "the elongation of the object decreased from 135 to 60 degrees during the campaign .",
    "the public target pixel time series files from the c1 and c2 fields were retrieved from the mast archive for the respective observations .    without stabilization around the third axis ,",
    "the _ kepler _ space telescope slowly rolls about the optical axis .",
    "this movement causes the field - of - view to rotate slightly and it is corrected by the on - board thrusters at every @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the spacecraft stores the pixels of pre - selected targets only , similarly to the primary mission , but larger target pixel masks are allocated for less targets in the k2 fields to accommodate the larger pointing jitter and less frequent data download periods .",
    "hence , the data acquisition principles are exactly similar to the stellar targets , only the combination of the small pixel masks of required additional steps during analysis .",
    "the attitude of the spacecraft was adjusted by a few pixels shortly after the start of both campaigns .",
    "this did not affect the data of but in the first 49 frames of campaign  2 , was too close to the edge of the mask and those were discarded .",
    "apart from these adjustments , the largest correction movements were always smaller than a pixel and the root mean squre of image shift offsets were @xmath19pixels for both campaigns .",
    "a closer inspection of the field - of - view movements revealed that the direction of motion reversed at the middle of the campaign and in some cases the correction maneuver did not occur and the telescope drifted for @xmath20 ( instead of @xmath17 ) .",
    ", @xmath21 and cover the @xmath22 _ kepler _ pixels , yielding a field - of - view of nearly @xmath23 .",
    "the image orientation is related to _ kepler _",
    "sensors during these observations , i.e. north is roughly to the left while east is downwards.,width=321 ]    while in the case of , the target pixel file contained a single stamp of @xmath22 pixels , the data extraction was much complex in the case of . here , the total mask related to this object has been splitted to individual target stamps containing only @xmath24 or @xmath25 pixels . hence , the first step of the reduction was the reconstruction of the effective section of the target ccd areas and the marking of the outlier pixels ( in order to exclude them from the further data processing ) . in the case of",
    ", we employed the pyke package @xcite to create individual fits frames for each timestamp while the combined and marked frame series for was created using the utilities of the fitsh package @xcite .",
    "prior to the light curve analysis ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : analysis ] ) , for the subsequent data processing steps we employed various tasks of the fitsh package ( esp . `",
    "fiign ` , ` fitrans ` , ` grtrans ` , ` grmatch ` , ` fiphot ` , ` fistar ` ) .    since the target pixel time series do not contain information regarding to the time variation of the astrometric solutions of the individual smaller stamps , frame registration had to be based on purely imaging data .",
    "due to the fairly strange shape of the field containing the apparent path of ( see .",
    "[ fig : traj ] ) , automatic source identification and cross - matching algorithms based on triangulation matching ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were not found to be effective .",
    "therefore , we manually selected seven prominent stars distributed nearly uniformly in the field .",
    "namely , we picked four stars located in the northern stripe and three stars in the southern stripe .",
    "initial pixel coordinates for these stars have been acquired using the ` imexam ` tool of iraf on adjacent frame pairs belonging to events where the pointing of _ kepler _ was changed abruptly .",
    "we found that this kind of manual analysis of @xmath26 images were sufficient in order to bootstrap the astrometry and for the cross - identification procedure for all of the @xmath27 individual images .",
    "after the cross - identification and the derivation of the differential transformations were performed , we used these transformations to register the images to the same system .",
    "then , we stacked every tenth of the images after correcting of the background variations in order to obtain a master frame .",
    "this master image was created using a median averaging to exclude the effects of the cosmic hits , as well as to safely rule out the contribution of other moving objects .",

    "the instrumental aperture was chosen to be relatively small due to the faintness of the object . despite the usage of differential images ,",
    "the residual structures were significant due to the undersampled property of the _ kepler _ camera .",
    "namely , the spline - based interpolation throughout the registration process always introduces undershootings in case of stellar profiles with small fwhms yielding characteristic features on the residual images ( see e.g. fig . 4 in * ?",
    "photometric uncertainties have been estimated considering photon noise and measured background scatter in the aperture annuli .",
    "for the photon noise estimation , we used the gain values reported in the original fits header , namely @xmath28 . as we will discuss later on ( sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] ) , this estimation was found to be reliable .    in the case of",
    ", we followed a similar data flow for image reduction , with the exception that the frame registration was much easier due to the smaller size and the fewer number of stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gvimage ] ) .",
    "namely , the number of unambiguously identified background stars was three and the mean of the centroid shifts ( in both directions ) was used to obtain the offset values for the image registration . in addition , we binned the images into intervals of @xmath29 in order to increase the signal in the frames .",
    "hence , each frame on which photometry is performed were derived from @xmath30 individual downlinked measurements . in all other aspects ,",
    "the photometry was performed identically for the two objects .    for both objects",
    ", photometric magnitudes have been transformed into usno - b1.0 @xmath31 system @xcite . in the case of",
    ", we found that the unbiased residual of the the photometric transformation between usno and _ kepler _ unfiltered magnitudes was @xmath32 , while for it was found to be @xmath33 .",
    "stars used for both objects have magnitudes spanning nearly homogeneously between @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",

    "coordinate of the centroid .",
    "the variations from the tno rotation and the spacecraft pointing adjustment are clearly separated.,width=207 ]",
    "the data produced from the baseline photometry consisted of time instance , magnitude and magnitude errors .",
    "2224 data points belonged to , and 129 points to , respectively .",
    "we tested that the photometric error estimates by the reduction pipeline are quite realistic .",
    "the mean determined photometric error of the entire dataset is @xmath36 magnitudes , while the mean of the standard deviation of data points in the boxcar is @xmath37 magnitudes .",
    "these values are comparable to each other within 30% accuracy . for later processing ,",
    "the weights of the photometric data were set to be proportional to @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the formal photometric error of each data points .",
    "we also observed that this approach overweights the outliers on the bright side , and may introduce a distortion in the shape of the light curve .",
    "this is because error sources , such as residuals after image subtraction , scatter toward both directions ( too faint and too bright ) , but the mean brightness is biased here , because the formal errors of bright - looking objects are much smaller , and they are given larger weights .",
    "therefore at the bright wing of data distribution , the weights were downscaled by a function of the shape    @xmath40 + 0.3\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 , the deviation of the measured @xmath42 magnitudes from the mean value .",
    "we selected @xmath43 times the peak of the fourier spectrum at the rotational period ( @xmath44 for and @xmath45 for , respectively ) . here",
    "the peak of the gaussian curve is damped by the @xmath46 function acting on it , leading to a flat plateau around the center of the shape .",
    "we are convinced that this rescaling leads to more realistic weights than the crude estimates making use of the measured flux values .",
    "however , in order to avoid biasing the results in any way , we compared the results with and without weighting , and we experienced that they were practically identical  so the modified weights supported merely the better visualization .",
    "the rotation periods were found by a fourier analysis .",
    "the fourier transform of the light curves were calculated by the period04 code @xcite . to exclude the light variation introduced by periodic systematics",
    ", we also calculated the periodograms of the pointing position of the telescope , the actual and the measured subpixel positions of the tnos in each frames .",
    "we did not find periodic signals resulting from the sampling effects ( therefore subpixel positions ) , but we identified the peak due to the pointing corrections with @xmath47 frequency ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fourier ] ) .",
    "this is close to the frequency peak belonging to a half rotation of , but they are still well separated , proving that the periodograms of the tnos reflect the rotation .",

    "based on its absolute magnitude at discovery ( @xmath49 ) and the cluster average geometric albedo of @xmath50 for objects in the outer kuiper belt @xcite , its likely effective diameter is @xmath51 .",
    "was also detected by the southern sky and galactic plane survey for bright kuiper belt objects @xcite , and an r - band absolute magnitude of @xmath52 was associated to the object .",
    "@xcite detected a light curve of , with a peak - to - peak amplitude of @xmath53 in the sloan _",
    "r _ band .",
    "the most likely light curve ( rotation ) period they found was @xmath54 , or similarly likely its double period , @xmath55 . however , other periods ( @xmath56 ) were also possible .",
    "the light curve was clearly non - sinusoidal .",
    "the absolute magnitude in this band was found to be @xmath57 .",
    "the period analysis confirmed the most likely solution of @xcite , namely @xmath58 .",
    "this is clearly the half of the rotation period , confirmed by the asymmetry of the phased light curve with @xmath59 period ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) . weighted means of the magnitude and corresponding phases",
    "were calculated in a boxcar of 68 data points .",
    "the standard deviation and the number of points in each bins resulted in an expected standard deviation ( error bars ) of @xmath60 magnitudes for the binned points .",
    "the smoothed light curve shows two humps with equivalent minima and slightly different peaks .",
    "the full amplitude is @xmath61 magnitude , the difference between the minima is @xmath62 magnitudes .",
    "the asymmetry and the non - sinusoidal shape of the light curve reflects the uneven surface structures .",
    "these features are quite common for solar system objects , e.g. a very similar light curve shape is observed for the main belt asteroid ( 52 )  europa at certain observing circumstances ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we can also conclude that the presented k2 measurement and the previous photometry of in @xcite shows similar characteristics since in the case of tnos , the phase and aspect angles varies rather slowly on the timescale of these observations .",

'' open time key program @xcite . using the upper limits set by the non - detections , a modelling of the thermal emission of the target resulted in an upper limit of its size ( @xmath65 ) , and a lower limit on its geometric albedo ( @xmath66 ,",

    "no light curve information is available for this target .",
    "the first light curve of this object is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] , phased with the most likely rotation period of @xmath67 and showing a double peak .",
    "since we had @xmath68 photometric points from k2 in this case , they were binned into @xmath69 points during one rotation , and the error bar of the binned points resulted to be @xmath70 magnitudes .",
    "the full amplitude of the light variation is @xmath3 magnitudes , which can be a sign of a more exposed asphericity than for .",
    "the most interesting feature of this tno is its long rotation period , as most tnos and centaurs have rotation periods shorter then a day @xcite .",
    "longer periods are expected from synchronously locked , tidally evolved binary systems ( see pluto / charon or sila / nunam , * ? ? ?",
    "it can explain the slow rotation of @xcite and can be plausible for either .",
    "moreover , observational statistics can explain binarity more likely for dynamically cold tnos @xcite .",
    "in addition , statistics seem to prefer close orbits ( fig . 4 in * ?",
    "* ) which can also yield mutual events and hence strong light curve variations .",
    "we clearly detected the rotational signal of two tnos with _ kepler _ during the k2 extended ecliptic survey mission . since these objects are moving through the field - of - view , photometric data reduction requires special care in order to retrieve accurate flux information .",
    "although the image processing needs complex steps , our results clearly show that the moving nature of these targets are also advantageous .",
    "namely , differential photometric techniques strenuously reduce the effects of background sources , even in the crowdness of _ kepler _ fields and in the case of lower imaging resolution and undersampled stellar profiles .",
    "in addition , the employment of moving apertures removes the frequency aliases caused by the pointing corrections of the spacecraft in every @xmath71 hours .",
    "all in all , we successfully demonstrated that it is feasible to observe faint tnos around their stationary points with _ kepler_/k2 and this mission provides a unique way to monitor them continuously for many weeks .",
    "the scientific benefit of observing tnos is the opportunity to provide an unbiased sample of rotational light curves  and hence data about shape , albedo and surface characteristics .",
    "this kind of information aids us to understand the nature and evolution of the outer solar system .",
