    "_ when did the cosmic dark ages end ?",
    "_ in the context of popular cold dark matter ( cdm ) models of hierarchical structure formation , the first stars are predicted to have formed in dark matter halos of mass @xmath0 that collapsed at redshifts @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the first quasars , on the other hand , are likely to have formed in more massive host systems , at redshifts @xmath2 @xcite , and certainly before @xmath3 , the redshift of the most distant quasar known @xcite .",
    "results from recent numerical simulations of the collapse and fragmentation of primordial clouds suggest that the first stars were predominantly very massive , with typical masses @xmath4 @xcite . despite the progress already made ,",
    "many important questions remain unanswered ; the purpose of this brief review is to discuss these open questions and to put them in perspective .",
    "an example for an open question is : _ how does the primordial initial mass function ( imf ) look like ? _ having constrained the characteristic mass scale , still leaves undetermined the overall range of stellar masses and the power - law slope which is likely to be a function of mass .",
    "in addition , it is presently unknown whether binaries or , more generally , clusters of zero - metallicity stars , can form . evidently , the observational signature as well as the fate of the first stars depend sensitively on whether primordial star formation is predominantly clustered or isolated .",
    "this in turn is affected by the nature of the feedback that the first stars exert on their surroundings .",
    "the first stars are expected to produce copious amounts of uv photons and to possibly explode as energetic hypernovae .",
    "_ how effective will their negative feedback be in suppressing star formation in neighboring high - density clumps ? _",
    "predicting the properties of the first stars is important for the design of upcoming instruments , such as the _ james webb space telescope _",
    "( jwst ) , or the next generation of large ( @xmath5 m ) ground - based telescopes .",
    "the hope is that over the upcoming decade , it will become possible to confront current theoretical predictions about the properties of the first sources of light with direct observational data .",
    "the increasing volume of new data on high redshift galaxies and quasars from existing ground - based telescopes , signals the emergence of this new frontier in cosmology .",
    "currently , we do not have direct observational constraints on how the first stars , the so - called population  iii stars , formed at the end of the cosmic dark ages .",
    "it is , therefore , instructive to briefly summarize what we have learned about star formation in the present - day universe , where theoretical reasoning is guided by a wealth of observational data ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "population  i stars form out of cold , dense molecular gas that is structured in a complex , highly inhomogeneous way .",
    "the molecular clouds are supported against gravity by turbulent velocity fields and pervaded on large scales by magnetic fields .",
    "stars tend to form in clusters , ranging from a few hundred up to @xmath6 stars .",
    "it appears likely that the clustered nature of star formation leads to complicated dynamics and tidal interactions that transport angular momentum , thus allowing the collapsing gas to overcome the classical centrifugal barrier @xcite .",
    "the imf of pop  i stars is observed to have the approximate salpeter form ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 the lower cutoff in mass corresponds roughly to the opacity limit for fragmentation .",
    "this limit reflects the minimum fragment mass , set when the rate at which gravitational energy is released during the collapse exceeds the rate at which the gas can cool ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the most important feature of the observed imf is that @xmath9 is the characteristic mass scale of pop  i star formation , in the sense that most of the mass goes into stars with masses close to this value . in figure 1 , we show the result from a recent hydrodynamical simulation of the collapse and fragmentation of a molecular cloud core @xcite .",
    "this simulation illustrates the highly dynamic and chaotic nature of the star formation process .    .",

    "star formation in the high redshift universe , on the other hand , poses a theoretically more tractable problem due to a number of simplifying features , such as : ( i ) the initial absence of heavy metals and therefore of dust ; and ( ii ) the absence of dynamically - significant magnetic fields , in the pristine gas left over from the big bang .",
    "the cooling of the primordial gas does then only depend on hydrogen in its atomic and molecular form .",
    "whereas in the present - day interstellar medium , the initial state of the star forming cloud is poorly constrained , the corresponding initial conditions for primordial star formation are simple , given by the popular @xmath13cdm model of cosmological structure formation .",
    "we now turn to a discussion of this theoretically attractive and important problem .",
    "_ how did the first stars form ?",
    "_ a complete answer to this question would entail a theoretical prediction for the population  iii imf , which is rather challenging .",
    "let us start by addressing the simpler problem of estimating the characteristic mass scale of the first stars . as mentioned before , this mass scale",
    "is observed to be @xmath9 in the present - day universe . to investigate the collapse and fragmentation of primordial gas ,",
    "we have carried out numerical simulations , using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) method .",
    "we have included the chemistry and cooling physics relevant for the evolution of metal - free gas ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "improving on earlier work @xcite by initializing our simulation according to the @xmath13cdm model , we focus here on an isolated overdense region that corresponds to a 3@xmath14peak : a halo containing a total mass of @xmath15 , and collapsing at a redshift @xmath16 .    in figure  2 ( _ left panel _",
    ") , we show the gas density within the central @xmath17  pc , briefly after the first high - density clump has formed as a result of gravitational runaway collapse . once the gas has exceeded a threshold density of @xmath18 @xmath19 , a sink particle is inserted into the simulation to replace it .",
    "this choice for the density threshold ensures that the local jeans mass is resolved throughout the simulation .",
    "the clump ( i.e. , sink particle ) has an initial mass of @xmath20 , and grows subsequently by ongoing accretion of surrounding gas .",

    "_ right panel _ ) , we show the gas density on a scale of 0.5  pc , which is two orders of magnitude smaller than before .",
    "several features are evident in this plot .",

    "second , a companion clump is visible at a distance of @xmath33  pc .",

    "this timescale is comparable to the lifetime of a very massive star ( vms)@xcite .",
    "if the second clump was able to survive the intense radiative heating from its neighbor , it could become a star before the first one explodes as a supernova ( sn ) .",
    "whether more than one star can form in a low - mass halo thus crucially depends on the degree of synchronization of clump formation . finally , the non - axisymmetric disturbance induced by the companion clump , as well as the angular momentum stored in the orbital motion of the binary system , allow the system to overcome the angular momentum barrier for the collapse of the central clump ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the recent discovery of the star he0107 - 5240 with a mass of @xmath35 and an iron abundance of @xmath36 } = -5.3 $ ] @xcite shows that at least some low mass stars could have formed out of extremely low - metallicity gas .",
    "our simulations show that although the majority of clumps are very massive , a few of them , like the secondary clump in fig .  2 , are significantly less massive . alternatively",
    ", low - mass fragments could form in the dense , shock - compressed shells that surround the first hypernovae @xcite .    _",
    "how massive were the first stars ?",
    "_ star formation typically proceeds from the ` inside - out ' , through the accretion of gas onto a central hydrostatic core . whereas the initial mass of the hydrostatic core is very similar for primordial and present - day star formation @xcite , the accretion process  ultimately responsible for setting the final stellar mass ,",
    "is expected to be rather different . on dimensional grounds , the accretion rate",
    "is simply related to the sound speed cubed over newton s constant ( or equivalently given by the ratio of the jeans mass and the free - fall time ) : @xmath37 .",
    "a simple comparison of the temperatures in present - day star forming regions ( @xmath38  k ) with those in primordial ones ( @xmath39  k ) already indicates a difference in the accretion rate of more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "our refined simulation enables us to study the three - dimensional accretion flow around the protostar ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we now allow the gas to reach densities of @xmath40 @xmath19 before being incorporated into a central sink particle . at these high densities , three - body reactions",
    "@xcite have converted the gas into a fully molecular form . in figure  3",
    ", we show how the molecular core grows in mass over the first @xmath41  yr after its formation .",
    "the accretion rate ( _ left panel _ ) is initially very high , @xmath42  yr@xmath26 , and subsequently declines according to a power law , with a possible break at @xmath43  yr . the mass of the molecular core ( _ right panel _ ) , taken as an estimator of the proto - stellar mass , grows approximately as : @xmath44 .",
    "a rough upper limit for the final mass of the star is then : @xmath45 .",
    "in deriving this upper bound , we have conservatively assumed that accretion can not go on for longer than the total lifetime of a vms .",
    "_ can a population  iii star ever reach this asymptotic mass limit ? _ the answer to this question is not yet known with any certainty , and it depends on whether the accretion from a dust - free envelope is eventually terminated by feedback from the star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the standard mechanism by which accretion may be terminated in metal - rich gas , namely radiation pressure on dust grains @xcite , is evidently not effective for gas with a primordial composition .",
    "recently , it has been speculated that accretion could instead be turned off through the formation of an h  ii region @xcite , or through the radiation pressure exerted by trapped ly@xmath46 photons @xcite .",
    "the termination of the accretion process defines the current unsolved frontier in studies of population  iii star formation .",
    "current simulations indicate that the first stars were predominantly very massive , and consequently rather different from present - day stellar populations .",
    "the crucial question then arises : _ how and when did the transition take place from the early formation of massive stars to that of low - mass stars at later times ?",
    "_ we address this problem next .",
    "the very first stars , marking the cosmic renaissance of structure formation , formed under conditions that were much simpler than the highly complex environment in present - day molecular clouds .",
    "subsequently , however , the situation rapidly became more complicated again due to the feedback from the first stars on the igm .",
    "supernova explosions dispersed the nucleosynthetic products from the first generation of stars into the surrounding gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) , including also dust grains produced in the explosion itself @xcite .",
    "atomic and molecular cooling became much more efficient after the addition of these metals .",
    "moreover , the presence of ionizing cosmic rays , as well as of uv and x - ray background photons , modified the thermal and chemical behavior of the gas in important ways ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "early metal enrichment was likely the dominant effect that brought about the transition from population  iii to population  ii star formation .",
    "recent numerical simulations of collapsing primordial objects with overall masses of @xmath0 , have shown that the gas has to be enriched with heavy elements to a minimum level of @xmath47 , in order to have any effect on the dynamics and fragmentation properties of the system @xcite .",
    "normal , low - mass ( population  ii ) stars are hypothesized to only form out of gas with metallicity @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the characteristic mass scale for star formation is expected to be a function of metallicity , with a discontinuity at @xmath49 where the mass scale changes by @xmath50 two orders of magnitude .",
    "the redshift where this transition occurs has important implications for the early growth of cosmic structure , and the resulting observational signature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "important caveats , however , remain .",
    "the determination of the critical metallicity mentioned above @xcite implicitly assumes that the gas at temperatures below @xmath51  k is maintained in ionization equilibrium by cosmic rays , with an ionization rate that is scaled from the galactic value by the factor @xmath52 . the cosmic - ray flux in the early universe",
    "might well have not obeyed this simple relation , and it is not clear whether cosmic rays could have successfully ` activated ' the metals .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the brightest electromagnetic explosions in the universe , and they should be detectable out to redshifts @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "although the nature of the central engine that powers the relativistic jets is still debated , recent evidence indicates that grbs trace the formation of massive stars @xcite .",
    "since the first stars are predicted to be predominantly very massive , their death might possibly give rise to grbs at very high redshifts .",
    "a detection of the highest - redshift grbs would probe the earliest epochs of star formation , one massive star at a time .",
    "the upcoming _ swift _ satellite , planned for launch in late 2003 , is expected to detect about a hundred grbs per year .",
    "the redshifts of high-@xmath54 grbs can be easily measured through infrared photometry , based on the gunn - peterson trough in their spectra due to ly@xmath46 absorption by neutral intergalactic hydrogen along the line of sight .",
    "_ which fraction of the detected bursts will originate at redshifts @xmath55 ? _    to assess the utility of grbs as probes of the first stars , we have calculated the expected redshift distribution of grbs @xcite . under the assumption that the grb rate is simply proportional to the star formation rate , we find that about a quarter of all grbs detected by _ swift _ , will originate from a redshift @xmath55 ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "this estimate is rather uncertain because of the poorly determined grb luminosity function .",
    "we caution that the rate of high - redshift grbs may be significantly suppressed if the early massive stars fail to launch a relativistic outflow .",
    "this is conceivable , as metal - free stars may experience negligible mass loss before exploding as a supernova .",
    "they would then retain their massive hydrogen envelope , and any relativistic jet might be quenched before escaping from the star @xcite .",

    "if high - redshift grbs exist , the launch of _ swift _ later this year will open up an exciting new window into the cosmic dark ages . in difference from quasars or galaxies that fade with increasing redshift",
    ", grb afterglows maintain a roughly constant observed flux at different redshifts for a fixed observed time lag after the @xmath58-ray trigger @xcite .",
    "the increase in the luminosity distance at higher redshifts is compensated by the fact that a fixed observed time lag corresponds to an intrinsic time shorter by a factor of @xmath57 in the source rest - frame , during which the grb afterglow emission is brighter .",
    "this quality makes grb afterglows the best probes of the metallicity and ionization state of the intervening igm during the epoch of reionization . in difference from quasars ,",
    "the uv emission from grbs has a negligible effect on the surrounding igm ( since @xmath59 ergs can only ionize @xmath60 of hydrogen ) .",
    "moreover , the host galaxies of grbs induce a much weaker perturbation to the hubble flow in the surrounding igm , compared to the massive hosts of the brightest quasars @xcite .",
    "hence , grb afterglows offer the ideal probe ( much better than quasars or bright galaxies ) of the damping wing of the gunn - peterson trough @xcite that signals the neutral fraction of the igm as a function of redshift during the epoch of reionization .     with different initial spins and no h@xmath61 molecules ( from @xcite ) .",

    "the existence of smbhs with inferred masses of @xmath68 , less than a billion years after the big bang , as implied by the recent discovery of quasars at redshifs @xmath69 @xcite , provides important constraints on the smbh formation scenario @xcite .",

    "_ can the seeds of smbhs form through the direct collapse of primordial gas clouds at high redshifts ? _",
    "previous work @xcite has shown that without a pre - existing central point mass , this is rendered difficult by the negative feedback resulting from star formation in the collapsing cloud .",
    "the input of kinetic energy due to supernova explosions prevents the gas from assembling in the center of the dark matter potential well , thus precluding the direct formation of a smbh .",

    "the virial temperature of these dwarf galaxies exceeds @xmath73k , so as to allow collapse of their gas through cooling by atomic hydrogen transitions @xcite . since structure formation proceeds in a bottom - up fashion , such a system would encompass lower - mass halos that would have collapsed earlier on .",
    "these sub - systems have virial temperatures below @xmath74  k , and consequently rely on the presence of h@xmath21 for their cooling . molecular hydrogen , however , is fragile and readily destroyed by photons in the lyman - werner bands with energies ( @xmath75  ev ) just below the lyman limit @xcite .",
    "these photons are able to penetrate a predominantly neutral igm .",
    "we first consider the limiting case in which h@xmath21 destruction is complete .",

    "what is the further fate of the central object ? once the gas has collapsed to densities above @xmath77  @xmath19 and radii @xmath78  cm , thomson scattering traps the photons , and the cooling time consequently becomes much larger than both the free - fall and viscous timescales ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the gas is therefore likely to settle into a radiation - pressure supported configuration resembling a rotating supermassive star .",

    "<S> we review recent theoretical results on the formation of the first stars and quasars in the universe , and emphasize related open questions . in particular , we list important differences between the star formation process at high redshifts and in the present - day universe . </S>",
    "<S> we address the importance of heavy elements in bringing about the transition from an early star formation mode dominated by massive stars , to the familiar mode dominated by low mass stars , at later times . </S>",
    "<S> we show how gamma - ray bursts can be utilized to probe the first epoch of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss how the first supermassive black holes could have formed through the direct collapse of primordial gas clouds .    </S>",
