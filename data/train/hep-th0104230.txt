    "in a couple of years , sen s conjectures on the tachyon condensation have successfully been examined using various types of open string field theories . in witten s cubic string field theory ( csft)@xcite , not only have the ( approximate ) tachyon potential  @xcite and lower dimensional d - branes as tachyonic lump solutions been constructed  @xcite , but also the absence of physical open string excitations ( more precisely , the triviality of the cohomology classes ) at the minimum of the tachyon potential has recently been verified in  @xcite . in boundary string field theory ( bsft )",
    "@xcite , the exact tachyon potential and lower dimensional d - branes have been worked out both in bosonic string theory  @xcite and in superstring theory ( @xcite for non - bps d - branes and @xcite for the brane - antibrane system ) . however",
    ", only a limited amount of works have been done using berkovits wess - zumino - witten  like open superstring field theory  @xcite .",
    "so far , the universal tachyon potential  @xcite , the effective potential for marginal deformation parameter of string field theory  @xcite and the tachyon potential in the d0/d4 system with a neveu - schwarz @xmath0-field  @xcite have been obtained .",
    "one of our aims of this paper is to provide this theory with a new piece of evidence that it correctly describes the dynamics of open superstrings by constructing tachyonic soliton solutions on a non - bps d@xmath1-brane which can be identified with bps d(@xmath2)-branes . in more detail",
    ", we find a kink solution whose tension is 94.9% of that of a bps d@xmath3-brane and a kink - antikink solution with its tension being 98.8% of the sum of the tensions of a bps d@xmath3-brane and a bps anti - d@xmath3-brane , in the level truncation scheme .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , after reviewing the formalism of berkovits superstring field theory , we prepare the level - expanded string field for the calculation of the action . in section 3 , we describe the construction of the solitonic solutions and then compare their tensions with the expected results . in section 4",
    "we briefly summarize our results .",
    "some of the details about the calculations are collected in appendices .",
    "in this section we describe only the relevant parts of the structure of the theory for later calculations . for more details , see  @xcite and chapter 3 of  @xcite .",
    "the wess - zumino - witten  like action for the neveu - schwarz sector string field @xmath4 on a non - bps d@xmath1-brane of type ii superstring theory is written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 the brst charge @xmath7 was decomposed into three parts according to the @xmath8-charge of each term .",
    "@xmath9 is the _ internal chan - paton _ matrix explained below . and @xmath10 are the bosonized superconformal ghosts defined as @xmath11 notice the _ orderings _ of the factors above because @xmath12 are all fermionic .",
    "some basic properties of world - sheet fields are summarized in table  [ tab : a ] .",
    ".some properties of the fields on an @xmath13 superstring world - sheet . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     notice that @xmath14 is in fact equal to the distance between the kink and the antikink due to the symmetry @xmath15 . for the same reason ,",
    "a configuration for a negative value of @xmath16 is equivalent to that for @xmath17 , so we wrote the results only for @xmath18 in table  [ tab : b ] .",
    "our numerical algorithm ceased to converge when we chose the value equal to or more than 0.12 for @xmath16 . from this table",
    ", one can find that the tension of the kink - antikink system gets _ lowered _ as the kink and the antikink come closer . in order to find out more detailed relation between the tension @xmath19 and the distance @xmath20 , we have plotted @xmath21 versus @xmath22 in figure  [ fig : fitting ] and fitted these data with a straight line .",
    "the result is @xmath23 or @xmath24     and the half - distance @xmath20 .",
    "the horizontal axis represents the value of @xmath21 , while the vertical axis @xmath22 .",
    "the dots are taken from table  [ tab : b ] , and the solid line shows the plot of the best fit  ( [ eq : cb ] ) . ]    as is seen from figure  [ fig : fitting ] , it nicely interpolates the data .",
    "we can read from the relation  ( [ eq : cc ] ) that the tension of the system almost quadratically depends on the ` co - distance ' @xmath25 between the kink and the antikink . though we do not understand the precise meaning of the exponent ` 2 ' appearing in eq.([eq : cc ] ) , it might have some physical meaning since the data points are well approximated by a straight line .",
    "one may possibly think that it is a manifestation of the attractive force between a brane and an antibrane .",
    "however , we do not think this to be the case .",
    "in addition to our claim made at the beginning of this sub - subsection , if the lifting of the potential originated from the attractive force , the @xmath20-dependence  ( [ eq : cc ] ) of the potential would depend on the dimensionality @xmath3 of the branes which interact via the exchange of closed strings . the fact that the formula  ( [ eq : cc ] ) does not contain the dimensionality at all implies that the lifting of the potential has nothing to do with the attractive force carried by the closed strings and is presumably an artifact of our level truncation approximation . in any case , what we have learned from the above analysis are :    * a kink and an antikink are automatically placed at diametrically opposite points of the circle if we solve the full set of equations of motion . * by setting @xmath16 to some fixed values and solving the equations of motion with respect to the other variables , we can deform the above kink - antikink solution along the quasi - flat direction of the potential representing the relative motion of the branes .",
    "* it seems that the tension of the kink - antikink system is lowered as the kink approaches the antikink .",
    "in this paper we have constructed a kink solution and a kink - antikink solution by applying the level truncation method to the berkovits version of open superstring field theory .",
    "the tensions of the solutions have agreed with those of the expected bps d - branes with a remarkable precision ( 95% and 99% respectively ) .",
    "we have also tried to see the quasi - flat direction of the potential corresponding to the relative motion of the kink and the antikink , with some questions unanswered .",
    "we have focused our attention only on the classical configurations of the string field on a non - bps d - brane .",
    "it would be interesting to study the fluctuation spectra around these solutions , as well as to construct a vortex solution after the tachyon condensation on a coincident brane - antibrane pair .",
    "i am grateful to prof .",
    "tohru eguchi for his insightful comments and careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "i would also like to thank teruhiko kawano , seiji terashima , tadashi takayanagi , tadaoki uesugi , kent ichikawa and kazuhiro sakai for valuable discussions .",
    "@xmath26    in the above lines , we used ( [ eq : m1 ] ) , ( [ eq : m2 ] ) so that @xmath27      @xmath28",
    "in this section we exhibit some computations of the action .",
    "firstly , at the level of approximation used in this paper , it is sufficient to keep only those terms with up to six string fields in the action  ( [ eq : a ] ) due to the conservation of @xmath8-charge and the level truncation  @xcite .",
    "we can further simplify the action by appealing to the twist symmetry and cyclicity properties  ( [ eq : q ] ) , the result being @xmath29 at the purely tachyonic level , @xmath30 , the nonvanishing terms are @xmath31 where we have taken the trace and used the decomposition  ( [ eq : b ] ) of the brst charge .",
    "let us show how to calculate them .",
    "since the brst charge @xmath7 and @xmath32 commute with the virasoro generators @xmath33 , we can conformally transform @xmath34 in advance , namely @xmath35 using the definition  ( [ eq : z ] ) of @xmath34 and the partial integration  ( [ eq : r ] ) , the 2-point correlator becomes @xmath36 where we have used the conformal transformation  ( [ eq : aa ] ) for @xmath37 , and defined @xmath38 the correlator in ( [ eq : ci ] ) is calculated as @xmath39 where we have used the action  ( [ eq : ah ] ) of @xmath40 on @xmath34 , the opes  ( [ eq : e6 ] ) , ( [ eq : e1 ] ) , the normalization  ( [ eq : p ] ) and @xmath41 on a d@xmath1-brane .",
    "multiplying it by the prefactors of  ( [ eq : ci ] ) , we finally obtain the expression for the quadratic term in @xmath42 as @xmath43 now we turn to the quartic terms .",
    "we need to calculate @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the subscript of the field denotes its position : _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath46 .",
    "the ghost correlator can be evaluated as @xmath47 using the relevant opes .",
    "then we find @xmath48 the quartic terms in the action can be written as @xmath49 where the exponent was put to the above form using the momentum conservation .",
    "combining eq.([eq : cg ] ) and ( [ eq : ch ] ) , we finally get the purely tachyonic string field theory action  ( [ eq : bh ] ) .    of course",
    ", we must also calculate a large number of correlators which contain non - tachyonic modes , even though only those terms with @xmath50 units of total @xmath8-charge will survive . as an example",
    ", we will illustrate the calculations with the following quartic coupling @xmath51 using the conformal transformation laws  ( [ eq : aa]),([eq : ab]),([eq : ag ] ) and the action  ( [ eq : ai ] ) of @xmath52 on @xmath34 , it can be calculated as @xmath53 where we have arranged the phase factor in the above way using the fact @xmath54 .",
    "( @xmath55 is a permutation of @xmath56 . )",
    "taking care not to forget the minus signs when fermionic fields pass each other , the ghost- and @xmath57-part becomes @xmath58 for the @xmath59-part , the ope  ( [ eq : e2 ] ) gives @xmath60 collecting these factors , we finally obtain @xmath61 repeating the computations this way , one could write down the component form of the action . concerning our result ,    1 .",
    "our action reproduces the level @xmath62 tachyon potential found in  @xcite when we restrict all fields in the action to zero momentum @xmath63 sector , and 2 .",
    "our action is manifestly real if the component fields defined in  ( [ eq : z ] ) are real .",
    "these features suggest that our action is correct .",
    "in particular , the fact ( 1 ) strongly supports the correctness of our calculations in the ghost sector .",
    "in ref.@xcite , a convenient computational scheme , using the conservation laws , for string field theory has been developed .",
    "although the authors of  @xcite made a brief comment on the applicability of the conservation laws to superstring field theory , we have judged that it is not very advantageous to use the conservation laws for calculating the string vertices in berkovits superstring field theory for the following reasons .",
    "the first point , though not so problematic , is that every string vertex contains the insertion of the brst charge @xmath7 , as opposed to the cubic vertex in bosonic cubic string field theory  @xcite . since it takes the complicated form @xmath64+a^{\\mathrm{g}}c_0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the operator representation ,",
    "we want to avoid making explicit use of it .",
    "the second point is the problem of dealing with the states in the  large \" hilbert space .",
    "if we were working in the  small \" hilbert space , it would be most convenient to write down the relevant conservation laws for the @xmath65 oscillators . however ,",
    "once we carry out the bosonization  ( [ eq : d ] ) of the @xmath65 ghosts in order to incorporate the zero mode of @xmath66 , we will be confronted with the treatment of the factor @xmath67 .",
    "since we are not given an oscillator form of it , we have to handle it in a similar way as the momentum factor @xmath68 .",
    "we are not familiar with such a formulation .",
    "the third problem consists in the way of finding the conservation laws . in the case of bosonic cubic string field theory , the virasoro conservation laws of the general form",
    "@xmath69 have been derived in  @xcite by introducing a holomorphic vector field @xmath70 . to obtain the virasoro conservation law for the @xmath71 case , we had to choose the vector field to be @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the insertion point of the @xmath74-th vertex operator on the boundary of the global disk .",
    "that is , @xmath70 has zeroes at punctures 1 and 3 , and has a simple pole at puncture 2 . if we wish to extend the conservation law  ( [ eq : ce ] ) for @xmath71 to , say , the 5-point vertex @xmath75 , it is expected that the holomorphic vector field must be of the form @xmath76 however , it does not respect the holomorphicity at infinity , which is expressed as @xmath77 hence it seems that it is impossible to write down virasoro conservation laws with a small value of @xmath78 for the string vertices of sufficiently high order .",
