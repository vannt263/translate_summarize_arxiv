    "dynamical systems of three or more bodies typically include physical phenomena known as _ mean motion resonances _ and _ secular perturbations_. the former occur when pairs of bodies have orbital periods whose ratio can be approximately expressed as a ratio of two small integers .",
    "otherwise , secular perturbations dominate the system s long - term evolution .",
    "each phenomenon can be described by particular terms in a gravitational potential which has become commonly known as a `` disturbing function '' @xcite , a dynamically rich segment of the hamiltonian of the system @xcite .",

    "classical ll theory remains useful @xcite in order to , qualitatively at least , describe secular motion .",
    "the formulation of the theory admits some compact analytical results @xcite and allows one to circumvent singularities present in lagrange s planetary equations , which explicitly describe the time evolution of orbital elements of a secondary .",
    "here we extend the planar theory to fourth order , and demonstrate the physical consequences of this extension . in doing so , we help remove a major assumption ( that requiring small eccentricities ) of the standard theory , and address the limits of the theory s applicability , even in its more general state .",

    "the orbital periods for several pairs of the planets in these @xmath4 systems are in a high - order mean motion commensurability , the effects of which typically dominate the long - term motion . however , other pairs of planets are near no such commensurability , and hence are described by orbital elements which vary primarily according to secular perturbations .",

    "interior _ to a massive object will precess at a slower rate given a greater initial eccentricity .",
    "such dependencies are not present in the traditional laplace - lagrange secular theory , which predicts ( under the assumption of a massive central body ) , the rates to be equal .    furthermore , by making use of the critical planetary separation needed to achieve hill stability @xcite",

    "as observed by @xcite , the definition of  resonance \" has been multiply - defined in the literature .",

    "if the bodies are too close to each other , the system will become unstable due to the saturation of mean motion resonances .",
    "wisdom ( 1980 ) provides an approximate criterion for this critical distance , which is proportional to the 2/7ths power of the primary - secondary mass ratio . if @xmath50 lies between these two extremes , _ and _ is sufficiently far from any sufficiently strong mean motion resonance , then standard ll theory predicts apsidal libration will occur .    in the fourth - order theory",
    ", many more terms are included in the disturbing function .",

    "quantitatively accurate secular solutions are difficult to obtain , even on a @xmath124 myr timescale , as both stable and chaotic long - term ( @xmath125 gyr ) solutions exist for the solar system within the uncertainties of current measurements @xcite . therefore , analytical results such as those from eqs .",
    "( [ rate1])-([rate2 ] ) , ( [ hill ] ) and ( [ threephi1])-([threephi3 ] ) may give representative _ qualitative _ descriptions of the dynamical state of the system on timescales shorter than those which may give rise to destructive stochasticity .    a purely secular theory , by definition ,",
    "does not incorporate the effects from the resonant terms which may cause the theory to fail .",
    "the true disturbing function includes an infinite number of terms , and depending on the orbital parameters of both resonant bodies , each term containing mean longitudes has a particular `` strength '' .",
    "in essence , a secular theory eliminates all of these terms , and justifies this neglect by appealing to how the combined strength of these terms should not match the strength of those terms without mean longitudes .",
    "in reality , however , resonant terms play a non - negligible role in the evolution of seemingly secular planetary and satellite systems .",
    "@xcite presented a way to incorporate `` near - resonant '' terms into laplace - lagrange secular theory , significantly improving their results .",
    "a similar approach could be invoked for fourth - order ll theory in order to improve its current general lack of agreement with the actual evolution of multi - planet exosystems .",
    "if the strong `` near - resonant '' term in question is a low - order resonance , then only one or two resonant terms might significantly impact the motion . with assumptions about the period of these terms , their tendency to circulate instead of librate at near - commensurabilities , the constancy of their coefficients , and their decoupled states",
    ", one can model each term as a pendulum , the paradigm for single - resonance models .",
    "the pendulum model allows one to define an energy and compute a circulation period for each resonant term , and ultimately to include the relevant averaged effects into the disturbing function .",
    "@xcite perform this task for first - order near - resonances . as per their discussion , expanding their theory in order to encompass a treatment such as ours would involve deriving the corrections due to second - order near - resonances and possibly dealing with the corrections introduced from coupling between resonant terms .    because secular eigenfrequencies are proportional to the resonant mass / central mass ratio and to the mean motion of the resonant masses , the utility of ll theory largely hinges on the values of the masses and semimajor axes of the resonant objects . unlike for secular satellite systems @xcite , the mass ratio in extrasolar systems is orders of magnitude larger .",
    "the result is that the quality of the results obtained from ll theory is sensitive to this ratio , a result also suggested by our numerical investigations .",
    "the planets in hd 108873 are close to a @xmath126:@xmath112 mmr . using the parameters for the planets from table 1 ,",
    "we find that the system s properties are sensitively dependent on the exoplanet masses and semimajor axis ratio , but are more robust to changes in initial eccentricity . a possible ( but speculative ) reason for this characterization is that eccentricities appear in the expressions for coefficients of resonant terms , but are not included in the expressions for the secular eignefrequencies .",
    "the neglect of inclination in our fourth - order theory ",
    "although already justified by the 1 ) unknown inclinations of the vast majority of extrasolar planets , 2 ) near - coplanarity of several dynamical subsystems in the solar system , and 3 ) complexities arising from the coupling of eccentricity and inclination in fourth - order ll theory  may not be of significant consequence given the marginal improvement afforded by expanding the theory to include eccentricity terms up to fourth - order .",
    "however , such coupled terms might introduce important nonlinearities in the solution of ll theory for fully three - dimensional problems , and deserve consideration in future studies .    a subsequent planar expansion to arbitrary order",
    "is possible and may proceed along the same lines as the method outlined here .",
    "expansion to @xmath5th order will involve terms in the disturbing function of the form @xmath127}$ ] , which can be expressed as polynomials in @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the differential equations representing the motion will contain @xmath31 , @xmath41 , @xmath32 and @xmath42 terms of all odd orders up to @xmath130th order",
    ". however , such an expansion may only be useful when seeking a highly accurate solution in systems where effects from barycentric drifts , short - period terms and mmrs may all be safely neglected .",
    "one may also generalize ll theory to fourth - order in the inclinations but not the eccentricities when modeling inclined circular orbits . under the small angle approximation , @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the inclination of body @xmath54 , the equations of motions and criteria for nodal libration will have exactly the same form as those of the planar case , except that the constants will not depend on the relative locations of the bodies being perturbed ( i.e. no delta functions would appear in the analog of eq . [ general ] ) as there is no preferred reference plane .",
    "a consequence is that the nodal rate of an inclined massless particle interior to a giant planet on a circular coplanar orbit would remain unchanged if the bodies switched semimajor axes . to fourth order ,",
    "this rate would be dependent on the massless particle s inclination , and be equal to :    @xmath133 \\nonumber\\\\ \\approx & & c_{a}^{(j ) } \\bigg [ -\\frac{3}{4 } \\alpha \\left ( 1 - \\frac{1}{2 } i_{j}^2   \\right ) + \\frac{153}{128 } \\alpha^2 i_{j}^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{45}{32 } \\alpha^3 \\left ( 1 - \\frac{1}{2 } i_{j}^2 \\right ) + \\mathcal{o } \\left ( \\alpha^4 \\right ) \\bigg ] \\label{inc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    comparison with eq .",
    "( [ rate2 ] ) demonstrates a difference of sign , but a remarkable similarity of coefficients .",
    "in fact , reduction to the traditional ll theory and to second order in @xmath50 demonstrates that the nodal rate exceeds the apsidal rate by exactly a factor of @xmath50 .",
    "the differences in the presence of powers of @xmath50 in eqs .",
    "( [ rate2 ] ) and ( [ inc ] ) are due to the different functions of the laplace coefficients which arise naturally from the expansion of kaula s disturbing function about zero eccentricities and inclinations .",
    "we have presented an analytical planar fourth - order ( in eccentricity ) formulation of traditional laplace - lagrange theory for two non - central bodies ( eqs .",

    "we have surveyed the prospects for secular resonance in multi - planet extrasolar systems , and , where appropriate , applied the traditional and generalized versions of ll theory and octupole - level theory to the systems .",
    "we conclude that expansion to high - eccentricity orders fails to compensate for the inherent drawbacks of the traditional theory when applied to extrasolar planetary systems , and is best utilized in dynamical systems with more restrictive orbital parameters .",
