    "our universe is organized in a cosmic web on megaparsec ( mpc ) scales , with filaments , voids and massive over - densities of matter .",
    "these most massive peaks in the large scale matter density are traced by galaxy clusters , the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "large samples of clusters together with subsequent mass and redshift estimates , allow us to constrain the cluster mass function and thus place improved constraints on important cosmological parameters such as @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ( see allen  et  al .",
    "2011 for a recent review ) as well as studying cluster evolution across cosmic time .",
    "several methods are employed to discover galaxy clusters .",
    "optical identification produces the largest cluster catalogs by far , and different algorithms focus on different aspects of optical properties , such as spatial galaxy over - densities ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the red sequence ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "optical identification schemes usually suffer from projection effects created by observing a three - dimensional object in a two - dimensional plane .",
    "however , optical surveys play a crucial role in measuring cluster redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "more recent methods include the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect and gravitational lensing .",
    "the sz effect is caused by cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons inverse compton scattering off the high energy electrons of the intracluster medium ( icm ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this can be seen as a distortion in the shape of the cmb spectrum and is used to follow - up known clusters as well as for new cluster surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "gravitational lensing provides a direct measure of the mass of a cluster and is observable through the deflection , shearing , and magnification of background sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "lensing and cosmic shear surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) trace the large scale structure ( lss ) , provide independent cluster mass estimates , map the dark matter within , and place independent constraints with improved calibration on cosmological parameters ( e.g. @xcite ) and potentially could be a useful detection method in future surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as demonstrated by the deep lens survey @xcite .",
    "galaxy clusters also appear as extended sources in the x - ray sky .",
    "hot electrons in the icm interact with protons and atomic nuclei to cause plasma emission in the x - ray regime ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray selected cluster surveys have been performed with many different combinations of survey depth and area , such as noras ( northern rosat all - sky survey , @xcite ) , 400sd ( 400 square degree survey , @xcite ) , and reflex ( rosat - eso flux - limited x - ray survey , @xcite ) . these studies and more",
    "are included in the mcxc catalog @xcite , a compilation of x - ray selected galaxy clusters and their characteristics .",
    "the mcxc catalog includes catalogs based on publicly available rosat all sky survey and serendipitous observations .",
    "recent examples of _ xmm - newton _  and/or _",
    "chandra _  selected cluster and group surveys include the champ ( _ chandra _  multiwavelength project ) serendipitous galaxy cluster survey @xcite , galaxy groups in the extended _ chandra _  deep field south @xcite , the _ xmm _ cluster survey @xcite , and the _ xmm - newton _  wide - field survey in the cosmos field @xcite .",
    "x - ray identification has several advantages over optical .",
    "first , x - ray observations of clusters suffer less from the projection effects that limit most optical surveys .",
    "because the x - ray emissivity is proportional to the square of the electron density , it provides good contrast over any background ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , there are several scaling relations based on x - ray data that galaxy clusters are known to follow . for example",
    ", the x - ray luminosity versus mass ( @xmath6@xmath7 ) relation is much tighter than the optical richness to mass relation and is a more accurate mass determination method ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one disadvantage to the x - ray identification of galaxy clusters is that it is difficult to detect high redshift clusters because of the @xmath8 dependence of surface brightness on redshift .",
    "thus , shallow x - ray surveys only detect the core region of high redshift clusters , which increasingly resemble point - like sources .",
    "also , low redshift galaxies can be extended x - ray sources and may appear as false positives in x - ray cluster surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is also difficult to get accurate measurements of redshifts from x - ray data alone .    therefore using x - ray and optical data in a combined program , like the one presented in this paper , is ideal for determining cluster characteristics .",
    "since the mass of a galaxy cluster is dominated by dark matter , their total masses are difficult to measure directly .",
    "thus , mass estimates are obtained by correlating cluster mass with easily observable quantities that include x - ray luminosity , richness ( number of member galaxies ) , temperature and velocity dispersions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "proving good correlations between independent mass estimates and further constraining them is imperative so that reliable measurements of the cluster mass function can be obtained .",
    "this allows us to investigate its evolution in time and thus better study the formation and evolution of structures and improve constraints on cosmological parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in this combined program we correlate the x - ray bolometric luminosity and the optical richness ( @xmath9 ) , comparing our results with other studies ( see section [ subsec : xlumvsopt ] ) .",
    "the _ swift _  gamma - ray burst ( grb ) fields provide 125 deg@xmath10 of serendipitous soft x - ray observations .",
    "several other groups are working with this dataset but with different focuses than this study @xcite , and we made comparisons to most of these works in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we compare our results to the more recent _ swift _  xrt cluster survey ( swxcs ) @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we detected 442 extended sources in these grb fields .",
    "of these , 209 lie in the footprint of the sdss dr8 @xcite .",
    "we can use this sdss data to look for over - densities in the photometric redshift distribution of the galaxies near the x - ray source . using the galaxy over - density detection method described in this paper , we confirm 104 of these candidates as galaxy clusters .",
    "our own optical observational data , extending to deeper magnitudes , will be presented in future works .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows",
    ". sections [ sec : swift ] and [ sec : sdss ] introduce the _ swift _  and sdss data , respectively .",
    "section [ sec : method ] describes the method employed to detect clusters .",
    "special cases are discussed in detail in section [ sec : cases ] .",
    "we discuss the properties of the cluster candidates with confirmed sdss galaxy over - densities in section [ sec : properties ] , including the overall redshift distribution (  [ subsec : overall ] ) , a comparison of the x - ray luminosity to the optical properties (  [ subsec : xlum ]  [ subsec : xlumvsopt ] ) , and the red sequence feature common amongst galaxy clusters (  [ subsec : redseq ] ) .",
    "we also compare our results to the literature . in section [ subsec :",
    "match ] , we match our catalog to other cluster surveys with large footprints on the sky .",
    "we briefly discuss cases found in a previous iteration of our x - ray source selection algorithm that are not in our current catalog (  [ sec : notcatalog ] ) . in section [ sec : discussion ] , we conclude with a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "we assume a cosmological model with @xmath11 kms@xmath12mpc@xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "the _ swift _  x - ray telescope ( xrt ) observations of grb fields provide a serendipitous x - ray survey . in @xcite , we describe in detail the data reduction and methods used in producing the x - ray cluster catalog . here",
    ", we briefly describe the reduction process and source extraction procedures .",
    "the _ swift _  xrt has a relatively large field of view ( 23.4@xmath1523.4 arcmin@xmath10 ) and is sensitive in the energy range of 0.210 kev .",
    "these grb observations are of medium - depth , and randomly distributed on the sky for a total area of @xmath16 deg@xmath10 with a median flux limit of 4@xmath1510@xmath17 .",
    "these data are ideal for finding galaxy clusters .",
    "we downloaded all xrt `` grb '' observations before 2013 - 07 - 27 , and reprocessed the data as described in @xcite . from this , we made images and corresponding exposure maps in different energy ranges : total ( 0.210 kev ) , soft ( 0.52 kev ) , and hard ( 210 kev ) .",
    "sources were detected in the images using the ciao tool ` wavdetect ` using a significance of detection threshold of 10@xmath18 .",
    "we excluded grbs by matching the known grb positions . to distinguish clusters from agns , we modeled the surface brightness profiles and compared to @xmath19-models representing a range of cluster masses and redshifts .",
    "we defined an extended source to be a cluster candidate if it had a s / n ratio @xmath20 , a minimum net photon count of 20 , and a size that is at least 3@xmath21 above the mean size of corresponding point sources at the same off axis angle . since our cluster detection criteria require a minimum of 20 photons , all the cluster candidates should be real astrophysical sources .",
    "false positives should arise only from confusing point agn with extended sources .",
    "the catalog of these 442 cluster candidates is given in table  4 of @xcite .",
    "sdss dr8 provides the optical data for this study .",
    "the publicly available data covers 14,555 deg@xmath10 and has magnitude limits of @xmath22 22.0 , 22.2 , 22.2 , 21.3 and 20.5 mag for the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 bands respectively @xcite . of the 442 cluster candidates , 209 are nominally in the sdss dr8 footprint .",
    "however , six candidates lie too close to the survey edges and were not considered further ( see figure [ fig : incsource ] ) , to leave us with 203 candidates in the sample .",
    "we downloaded catalogs of the positions , magnitudes , photometric redshifts , and available spectroscopic redshifts for all galaxies within a 40  radius of the cluster candidate centers to provide both source and background regions .",
    "a small fraction of these regions are incomplete in coverage due to either being on the edge of the sdss sky coverage , bright object masks or cosmic ray masks ( we discuss these in detail in section [ subsec : incomplete ] ) .",
    "we searched for galaxy over - densities in three - dimensional space using the galaxy positions and photometric redshifts provided by sdss dr8 . where available , spectroscopic redshifts are used in place of the photometric redshifts . for each cluster candidate",
    ", we considered source regions with radii of 2  and 3  centered on the x - ray centroid .",
    "we then selected the galaxies within the prescribed source regions and separated them into redshift bins of width @xmath28 .",
    "the sdss photometric redshifts include uncertainties , which have an average of @xmath29 @xcite , larger than this binsize ; however , the accuracy of the cluster redshift is improved by @xmath30 and is typically smaller than @xmath28 , where @xmath31 is the number of galaxies above the background in the 2  or 3  source region and within the redshift bin .",
    "we search for over - densities by comparing this redshift distribution to that of the local background .",
    "we measured the local background in an annulus extending from 25  to 40  and centered on the _ swift _  sources , where the inner radius was chosen to be sufficiently distant from the cluster regions to avoid contamination from the cluster .",
    "local backgrounds are needed in our analysis due to cosmic variance and any non - uniformity in the exposure depth .",
    "an example of this variability can be seen in figure [ fig : incsource ] where there is a distinct difference in the galaxy density between swcl j215423.1 ( top left ) and swcl j015021.7 ( top right ) . from the background annulus of each source , we chose 100 random regions equal in size to the source region ( so with radii of 2  or 3 ) and calculated the mean and standard deviation of the galaxy count in each redshift bin .",
    "this monte - carlo approach is more general because it does not assume background distributions simply described by poisson fluctuations .",
    "we compare the average background count and its standard deviation per redshift bin to the redshift distribution of the source region .",
    "we consider an over - density peak significant if the number of galaxies in a redshift bin is 3@xmath21 above the averaged background and if the galaxy count is at least seven . setting a minimum galaxy count is important to reduce the false positives for higher redshift clusters ( @xmath32 ) , where the number of detected galaxies is low so that the standard deviation is rather small , and the 3@xmath21 cut can be affected more by systematic uncertainties , such as the incompleteness of galaxies in sdss for higher redshifts . for potential clusters with multiple over - density peaks ,",
    "we select the most significant redshift bin for that candidate .",
    "if the original distribution did not pick up a significant over - density peak , we shift all of the distribution bins to the left by 0.025 and search for over - density peaks as before . using this method",
    ", we search at most 40 redshift bins of width @xmath28 for each cluster candidate .",
    "since all of our optically confirmed clusters are below @xmath33 , we essentially have at most 32 redshift bins for detection . for the 203 cluster candidates , the expected number of @xmath34 false positives is @xmath35 or approximately 9% of the identifications .",
    "the cluster redshift is determined by averaging the galaxy redshifts in the over - density bin . however , this includes foreground and background galaxies in the bin so the cluster redshifts determined favor the center of the over - density bin . to measure a more accurate cluster redshift",
    ", we shift the center of the bin @xmath36 using increments of 0.001 . for each case",
    ", we perform the same method as before .",
    "we keep the most significant over - density as the best redshift estimate and report cluster details in table [ tab : confz ] .",
    "this maximizes the likelihood of our method measuring accurate redshifts while maintaining a low number of tests to minimize the number of false positives .",
    "our results are listed in table [ tab : confz ] , where  ...  indicates cases where no 3@xmath21 peak was detected for either the 2  or 3  source region sizes .",
    "we confirm sdss over - density peaks for 104 of the 203 cluster candidates in the sdss footprint .",
    "this does not mean that the remaining 105 are not clusters because the sdss data are only deep enough to confirm @xmath37 clusters consistently .",
    "examples of our sdss cluster confirmation for two _ swift _  xrt images of grb060204b and grb061110a are shown in figures [ fig : sw1 ] and [ fig : sw2 ] , respectively .",
    "the blue circles mark the positions of the extended x - ray sources , and the galaxy redshift distributions for the _ swift _  cluster candidates ( red dashed lines ) are shown in separate panels together with the local mean redshift distribution and the @xmath34 level above the local mean .    for each candidate with a confirmed over - density peak , we measure the distance between the bcg and the x - ray source center , and calculate the distribution of the physical offsets ( in mpc ) between the bcg and the x - ray source center ( figure [ fig : bcg ] ) .",
    "we select the bcg as the galaxy with the brightest sdss @xmath38band magnitude in the source region and the @xmath28 redshift bin . in table",
    "[ tab : confz ] , we list the sdss @xmath38band apparent and absolute magnitudes of the bcgs and their physical offsets to their corresponding x - ray centers . it is often assumed that both bcgs and x - ray centroids define the center of the cluster potential wells and thus , their locations should overlap .",
    "however , in studies of optically selected galaxy groups it has been found that the brightest halo galaxies can be satellite galaxies instead of central galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also found that the number of brightest halo galaxies that were not central increased when studying a higher group mass bin .",
    "we show our calculated mass ( details in section [ subsec : xlum ] ) versus bcg - to - x - ray offset in figure [ fig : massvsbcg ] and find the opposite to be true for our sample , that higher mass clusters have low bcg offsets .",
    "the bcg - to - x - ray centroid distance distribution exhibits a broad tail extending from a compact core ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we compare our offset distribution with that of 2mass clusters @xcite , which is normalized to match our sample count , and find that the distributions are similar .    of the 104 confirmed clusters ,",
    "there are 73 cases where our method found sdss galaxy over - densities for both the 2  and 3  regions .",
    "70% of these cases agree within the redshift range @xmath39 , where we assigned the more significant peak as the redshift of the cluster .",
    "the twenty - four cases where the 2  and 3  regions both detect an over - density peak but the peaks are located in different redshift bins are listed in table [ tab : cases ] .",
    "we compared both the significance of the over - density peak and the bcg - to - x - ray center offset ( in mpc ) for both possibilities and assign a score as @xmath40mpc for each cluster in table  [ tab : cases ] .",
    "if the score is positive ( negative ) then we assign the redshift to that measured by the 2  ( 3 ) region .",
    "the final assigned redshifts are shown in bold in table [ tab : cases ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss the situation where multiple _ swift _  cluster candidates",
    "are closely located in angular position and redshift space and check for complications in the sdss confirmation method .",
    "we also discuss how we treat clusters with incomplete sdss coverage of either the source or background areas .",
    "we found four cases with _ swift _",
    "cluster candidate pairs within 6  of each other and with similar redshifts ( @xmath41 ) . with the possibility of overlapping source regions , these could result in false positive detections or redshift mis - assignments and thus require a closer examination . for each case , we compare the following for the cluster properties in question : the significance of the over - density peak , confirmation using the other source region size ( so either 2  or 3 ) , the bcg@xmath42to@xmath42x - ray offset , any other redshift peaks over @xmath34 ( i.e.  multiple peaks ) , and both x - ray images and galaxy positions .",
    "we list the conclusions of our analysis in table  [ tab : close ] , and show two examples in figures [ fig : nearbycont ] and [ fig : nearbycont2 ] , where we also include a discussion of our conclusions in the figure captions .",
    "swcl j215423.1 and swcl j215413.2 are separated by a distance of 2@xmath437 and both have a high significance peak ( @xmath44 ) around @xmath45 , and swcl j215413.2 has a second galaxy over - density peak at @xmath46 ( with significance @xmath47 ) .",

    ", we detected over density peaks at @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) using 2  ( 3 ) source size regions for swcl j092719.6 , but only a peak at @xmath55 using 2  region for swcl j092730.1 . further examining the bcg offsets , significance of the peaks and the x - ray images , we determine that both are clusters , possibly merging .",
    "we reach a similar conclusion for the swcl j085552.1 and swcl j085619.7 pair ( figure [ fig : nearbycont2 ] ) .",
    "if a cluster candidate is close to the edge of the sdss footprint , then the 40  region surrounding the x - ray source s center will appear to be artificially devoid of galaxies .",
    "in addition , there are masking regions associated with bright sources and cosmic rays in the images . to check for coverage completeness for each candidate cluster",
    ", the galaxy distribution within 40  of x - ray source center was visually inspected .",

    "for example , @xcite discuss two methods of linear regression solutions , the ordinary least - squares ( ols ) bisector and orthogonal regression ( e.g. , @xcite , where the ols bisector is the line that bisects the ols solution minimized in the y direction ( ols(y|x ) ) and the ols solution minimized in the x direction ( ols(x|y ) ) .",
    "@xcite found that the orthogonal regression line was better suited for this fit , especially in cases of large scatter .",
    "for ease of comparison and based on their results , we choose to use the orthogonal regression method .",
    "we find our slope is on the shallow end of those seen in @xcite .",
    "here we mention a few potential reasons for this difference .",
    "we define optical richness in section [ subsec : opticalprop ] , and @xcite use a definition based on a physical aperture and apparent magnitude of member galaxies .",
    "furthermore , we use a bolometric x - ray luminosity and they use @xmath6 in the [ 0.1@xmath422.4 kev ] energy band .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite use bolometric x - rayluminosities and report slopes of 1.56 and 3.60 , respectively .",
    "since clusters are virialized objects , the predicted scaling relation between @xmath6 and mass is @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 ( e.g. , kaiser 1991 ) .",
    "however , with the presence of non - gravitational effects , the scaling relations deviate from the above predictions .",
    "one of the recent measurement between @xmath6 and total mass and stellar mass yields @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( anderson et al .",
    "2015 ) and our measured slope * @xmath99 agrees with the @xmath6@xmath73 relation but deviates from the @xmath6@xmath100 relation of anderson et al .",
    "( 2015 ) . and",
    "our measured slope of @xmath101 , using a fit without error dependent weights , agrees with the @xmath6@xmath100 relation .",
    "* since all of these measurements have their own systematic uncertainties , we do not expect an exact match in the slopes at this stage . however , those studies that measured extreme steep slopes , 45 , for the @xmath6@xmath9 relation were subject to more severe systematic uncertainties .",
    "we show @xmath6 as a function of bcg @xmath102 in figure [ fig : xlumvsbcgmag ] . here",
    "we test the correlation of luminosity and mass of the icm with the luminosity of the bcg .",
    "although there is a large scatter , we observe a general positive correlation when we fit the data with the orthogonal regression method ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the data is well correlated , with a spearman s correlation coefficient of @xmath103 and a probability of 0.03 .",
    "points shown in red indicate the bcgs with smallest bcg - to - x - ray center offsets .",
    "these clusters show less scatter than clusters with greater bcg - to - x - ray offsets , with correlation coefficients of @xmath104 and @xmath105 and probabilities of 0.04 and 0.27 , respectively .",
    "we examined the color distributions for each candidate with a confirmed sdss galaxy over - density to search for the red sequence feature seen in galaxy clusters .",
    "in general , cluster members and the surrounding background form a bimodal color distribution that is well represented by a two gaussian fit , as seen in figure [ fig : colorplot ] ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the narrow , taller gaussian is the red sequence feature , prominent in galaxy clusters .",
    "the distribution of background and/or foreground field galaxies can generally be approximated with a shallower , wider gaussian , because the background galaxies are from different redshifts and the weak color bimodality is smoothed by redshifts .",
    "following @xcite , we shifted between the @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 colors to follow the shifting location of the balmer break with redshift .",
    "the redshift ranges used for each color are listed in table [ tab : colredrange ] .    for each cluster candidate with a confirmed sdss galaxy over - density , we examine the color distribution using galaxies within 3  of the cluster center and within redshifts @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is our measured cluster redshift .",
    "we fit the color distribution to a two gaussian model where we allow the normalization , mean , and width of both gaussians to vary and minimize the @xmath111 statistic . for the lower redshift clusters , @xmath112",
    ", we use a single gaussian model with one prior for the expected color . for these cases , we do not observe color contribution from the background galaxies , likely due to the extent of the clusters on the sky .",
    "our two gaussian model includes priors that constrain the width of the red sequence compared to that of the background and constrain the mean of the red sequence to favor the colors used by @xcite in their catalog of gaussian mixture brightest cluster galaxy ( gmbcg ) clusters .",
    "we use the second prior because we know from @xcite how the red sequence evolves with redshift ( see figure [ fig : meancolorplot ] ) .",
    "we calculate the second prior by averaging the color of gmbcg clusters in redshift bins of width @xmath28 .",
    "these are shown by green diamonds in figure [ fig : meancolorplot ] and by the vertical lines in figure [ fig : colorplot ] .",
    "we find the red sequence feature in @xmath11385% of the confirmed clusters .",
    "the cluster galaxies ( red dots in figure [ fig : colorplot ] , right ) , are the galaxies with color within 2@xmath21 of the red sequence mean .",
    "two examples are shown in figure [ fig : colorplot ] , along with corresponding color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) . here",
    "we can observe the red sequence feature clearly both in the narrow histogram and in the clustering of galaxies in color - magnitude space .",
    "we also show the mean red sequence color as a function of redshift in figure [ fig : meancolorplot ] .",
    "although there is a significant amount of scatter , figure [ fig : meancolorplot ] shows a general positive trend for the g @xmath42 r and r @xmath42 i colors as redshift increases , as expected .",
    "we include gmbcg cluster colors from @xcite ( dots ) in figure [ fig : meancolorplot ] as well as the color priors used for our two gaussian fit ( green diamonds ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : massredseq ] , we plot the mass of clusters with confirmed redshifts , denoting clusters with a detected red sequence with red triangles and clusters without with black crosses ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we see that in general there is no difference in mass dependence .",
    "we performed a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test to determine whether the two mass distributions are in fact different .",
    "we find there is a 0.56 probability that the distributions are drawn from the same distribution , signifying that the mass distribution of clusters with a detected red sequence is not significantly different than those without a detected red sequence .",
    "however , we do detect the red sequence in the six most massive clusters , so clusters with mass greater than @xmath114 . also , we find that the redshift distributions for detected red sequences versus undetected are significantly different , with a k - s test probability of 0.03 .",
    "the non - detections of the red sequence in our survey has several origins .",
    "the principle problem is that many of the galaxies are relatively faint , potentially leading to large color errors compared to the width of the red sequence .",
    "galaxies fainter than the magnitude limit of sdss will not be included in the color distributions , so that the distribution may not fit the two gaussian model .",
    "this is especially true for more distant clusters where the observed flux is lower . at low redshifts , the x - ray data is also sensitive enough to include lower mass groups , which lack the well - defined red sequences of rich clusters .",
    "@xcite had similar issues in their study of low x - ray luminosity galaxy clusters .",
    "we compare our catalog to other studies across multiple wavelengths to test for accuracy and completeness .",
    "we chose to compare to catalogs with large footprints since our _ swift _  targets are scattered over a large fraction of the sky .",
    "first , we compare with optical catalogs , starting with the 132,684 galaxy clusters in the catalog from @xcite .",
    "their method uses a friend - of - friend algorithm incorporating sdss iii galaxies to identify clusters and their bcgs .",
    "we used a matching angular radius of up to 1 .",
    "out of 44 position matches , 41 agree in redshift within @xmath115 with an average redshift difference of 0.026 .",
    "these are listed in table [ tab : gmbcg ] .",
    "of the 41 redshift matches , @xmath116% have mass greater than the median mass of our sample , showing that in general we are matching our more massive clusters to the optically selected catalog .",
    "@xcite claimed their catalog is 95% complete for @xmath117 and for the redshift range @xmath118 , and our sample is complete for @xmath117 and @xmath119 0.3 .",
    "the number of clusters per survey area for the overlapping conditions @xmath117 and 0.05 @xmath120 0.3 are equal ( @xmath121 ) and thus , the completeness statements for both samples are in agreement .",
    "we also compare our confirmed cluster redshifts to the gmbcg clusters @xcite . using the above matching procedure , there are 18 position matches and 15 that agree in position as well as redshift , 14 of which are in the @xcite catalog .",
    "swcl j121628.2 is not in the @xcite catalog , so the right ascension , declination and separation reported in table [ tab : gmbcg ] refer to the gmbcg catalog .",
    "the differences in redshift and position between our catalog and these optical catalogs could arise from the fact that our clusters are x - ray selected and thus centered on the x - ray emission from the clusters as opposed to their optically selected clusters",
    ". however , some of the matches with large angular match radii ( @xmath122@xmath43@xmath123 ) might be spurious associations .",
    "here we compare to catalogs with selections based on x - ray , sz and lensing data .",
    "these trace the location of the gas in the cluster ( e.g. , @xcite ) and should align with our sources better than optically selected surveys , so we use a smaller matching radius of 30 .",
    "we search for matches to x - ray selected clusters using the meta - catalog of x - ray detected clusters of galaxies ( mcxc , @xcite ) .",
    "mcxc comprises of 1743 clusters and combines the rosat all sky survey with cluster surveys based on serendipitous observations .",
    "we find only two previously detected clusters , mcxc_j1557.7 + 3530 at redshift @xmath124 and mcxc_j1557.7 + 3530 at @xmath125 . these match to our clusters swcl j155743.3 at @xmath126 and swcl j025630.7 at @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "swcl j025630.7 is also detected with the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) @xcite using the sz effect .",
    "this is the only cluster match when compared to the 148 ghz observations by act of 68 galaxy clusters .",
    "we also compared our survey to the first release of sz sources observed by planck @xcite and found that swcl j084749.4 at @xmath128 is a match to psz1_g213.43 + 31.78 at @xmath129 .",
    "finally , we compared our confirmed galaxy clusters to the deep lensing survey @xcite but found no matches .    in @xcite , we compared our catalog of extended sources to the _ swift _  xrt cluster survey ( swxcs ) @xcite , and found 55 of 72 sources agreed in position to within 30 .",
    "@xcite expanded the analysis from using only grb fields in @xcite to also including non - grb fields , increasing the number of fields to @xmath130 and finding 263 cluster candidates in a total solid angle of @xmath131 deg@xmath10 .",
    "they cross - correlated their catalog with optical , x - ray , and sz catalogs to match known galaxy and galaxy cluster redshifts that have similar positions .",
    "of the 442 extended sources in @xcite , 88 agree within 30  and 68 agree within 10 .",
    "although the number of swxcs cluster candidates increases from 72 to 263 @xcite , we do not see a comparative increase in matches because , like @xcite , our analysis includes only _ swift _",
    "grb fields .",
    "we compared the positions of our sdss confirmed galaxy clusters to their updated catalog and found 37 position matches in the sdss footprint using a matching radius of 10 .",
    "these are shown in table [ tab : liu ] . in @xcite , there are clusters with multiple reported redshifts that come from comparing the swxcs to other studies . for these cases , we report the average of those redshifts in table [ tab : liu ] . of those 37 matches ,",
    "23 have redshifts in both catalogs , 22 agree within @xmath115 and 19 agree within @xmath132 with an average redshift difference of @xmath133 .",
    "furthermore , 17 of the 37 position matches were also matched to the @xcite catalog and thus are also presented in table [ tab : gmbcg ] .",
    "we went through various iterations of the x - ray source selection method before using the latest one discussed in @xcite .",
    "there are 10 x - ray sources selected using a previous version of our algorithm that were confirmed as galaxy clusters using sdss data and the method described above .",
    "these are listed in table [ tab : notcatalog ] . due to slight changes in the x - ray source selection algorithm ,",
    "the significances of these sources changed to be below the significance threshold and so are not included in the current catalog or in table [ tab : confz ] .",
    "these clusters are worth mentioning for researchers interested in these individual clusters in future studies .",
    "in this paper , we present sdss identifications ( table [ tab : confz ] ) , including estimated redshifts , x - ray and optical properties , for the x - ray selected galaxy clusters we identified in @xcite .",
    "we confirmed 104 of the 203 cluster candidates in the sdss footprint and estimate that the catalog is 80% complete up to @xmath134 .",
    "most of the remaining cluster candidates are expected to be at higher redshifts where the member galaxies are too faint to use sdss for confirmations .",
    "this sample significantly increases the number of x - ray selected clusters with confirmed redshifts and it is one of the largest uniformly - selected cluster samples , covering a total sky area of 125 deg@xmath10 .",
    "we observe clear red sequences and clustering of galaxies in color - magnitude space in @xmath11385% of the clusters .",
    "x - ray source centers and bcg locations show good agreement , with small offsets and distributions similar to other studies .",
    "we find clear matches with previously observed clusters .",
    "our x - ray luminosities correlate well with optical properties and our @xmath93 slope agrees with other estimates .",
    "thus , it is clear the _ swift _  cluster detection technique presented in @xcite is successfully identifying extended x - ray sources that are in fact galaxy clusters . in future studies",
    ", we will look at changing the significance threshold of the x - ray source detection @xcite as it may be too stringent currently .",
    "for example , we list 10 clusters in table [ tab : notcatalog ] that were confirmed by the sdss data but removed from the current x - ray catalog based on the final choice for the significance threshold .",
    "our method combines x - ray and optical techniques and properties to confirm galaxy cluster candidates and can be used for similar studies . in this way we find 63 new galaxy clusters in the sdss footprint that were not detected using the optical cluster finding methods of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the next step is to look deeper in magnitude and beyond the footprint of sdss .",
    "although sdss was a good start , the data is too shallow for higher redshift clusters and has incomplete sky coverage .",
    "there are @xmath135 undetected _ swift _  extended sources in the sdss footprint , and still @xmath136 outside , for a total of @xmath137 .",
    "we have been performing our own followup observations with observing programs taking photometric data at the mdm 2.4 m , kitt peak 4 m , and ctio ( cerro tololo inter - american observatory ) 4 m .",
    "we have also observed candidates with redshifts of @xmath138 at the magellan 6.5 m and mdm 2.4 m using multi - slit spectroscopic masks .",
    "once we derive galaxy redshifts from our data we will use the method outlined in this paper to confirm additional clusters at higher redshifts .",
    "furthermore , our sample will be more statistically significant when it is more complete , which will lead to better constraints on the cluster mass function .",
    "funding for the creation and distribution of the sdss archive has been provided by the alfred p. sloan foundation , the participating institutions , the national aeronautics and space administration , the national science foundation , the us department of energy , the japanese monbukagakusho , and the max planck society .",
