    "<S> the inner crust of a neutron star consists of nuclei immersed in a superfluid neutron liquid . as these nuclei move through the fermionic medium they bring it into motion as well . </S>",
    "<S> as a result their mass is strongly renormalized and the spectrum of the ion lattice vibrations is significantly affected . </S>",
    "<S> consequently we predict that the specific heat and the lattice thermal energy of the coulomb crystal at these densities are noticeably modified .    in the standard picture </S>",
    "<S> the inner crust of a neutron star consists of neutrons , protons and electrons . at low temperatures ( @xmath0 mev ) </S>",
    "<S> one expects the presence of atomic nuclei ( ions ) immersed in a neutron gas . at the densities : @xmath1 g/@xmath2 g/@xmath3 they form a crystal lattice stabilized by the coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the electrons which are ultrarelativistic at these densities form a strongly degenerate , uniform gas . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed structure of this part of the star has been the subject of a considerable theoretical effort ( .@xcite and references therein ) . at the bottom of the crust </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of non - spherical nuclei , forming exotic structures , has been predicted . in this region besides the coulomb interaction also the quantum effects , associated with a neutron scattering on nuclear inhomogeneities , play an important role , leading eventually to a disordered phase .@xcite .    in order to understand various processes associated with thermal evolution of a neutron star , </S>",
    "<S> the properties of coulomb crystals in the inner crust have been studied by many authors ( see e.g. .@xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma frequency of the system reads : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the ion density , @xmath6 is the proton number of an ion , and @xmath7 is the ion mass . since @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the wigner - seitz cell radius then : </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 the quantities : @xmath6 and @xmath9 , in the above equation , can be obtained from calculations based on a density functional method . </S>",
    "<S> however , the determination of the ion mass @xmath7 requires a certain caution , since the nucleus is immersed in the fermionic environment and its bare mass has to be renormalized to take into account the interaction with surrounding neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> if the neutrons outside a nucleus have formed a normal fermi gas the problem would have been rather complicated.@xcite . in the inner crust </S>",
    "<S> , however , it simplifies due to the fact that at low temperatures , @xmath11 mev , the neutron gas is predicted to be strongly paired . in this case </S>",
    "<S> one may apply the hydrodynamic approximation which describe the system by an irrotational velocity field . </S>",
    "<S> although at finite temperatures there always exists a gas of quasiparticle excitations which form a normal flow , at temperatures much lower than the critical temperature its influence can be neglected .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume in the following that the nucleus has a uniform nucleon density @xmath12 and fills a sphere of radius @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron gas is characterized by the density @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume moreover that the flow velocity is below the critical velocity for loss of superfluidity .    in order to calculate the mass @xmath7 of an ion , </S>",
    "<S> the poisson equation for the velocity field has to be solved , both inside and outside a nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary conditions read : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 stand for the velocity field inside and outside a nucleus , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the vector @xmath18 is an outward normal to the surface of a spherical nucleus and @xmath19 is a radial coordinate ( the center of a nucleus is placed at @xmath20 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of the surface element was denoted by @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the first equation stems from the requirement that the phase of the wave function of the superfluid system is continuous , the second one is a conservation of mass in radial flow , and finally the third one ensures that the correct asymptotic behavior for the velocity field is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge of the velocity field allows us to determine the kinetic energy and corresponding effective ion mass . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the following expression for the mass of an ion being a subject of a translational motion can be derived : @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a nucleon mass .    </S>",
    "<S> the above expression relates the mass of an ion to the density of the neutron gas . </S>",
    "<S> note , that for a uniform system , i.e. @xmath25 the ion mass is equal to zero . </S>",
    "<S> since the nucleon density vary substantially across the inner crust , one expects that the properties of the coulomb crystal will be noticeably modified . indeed , the plasma frequency in the inner crust changes as compared to the value calculated for the case : @xmath26 ( ion in the vacuum ) . </S>",
    "<S> namely , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 corresponds to the plasma frequency for the system with renormalized ion masses .    in the fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 we have plotted @xmath29 and @xmath30 as a function of the nucleon density . </S>",
    "<S> one can notice large discrepancies between the value obtained using the bare nuclear mass and the renormalized one . </S>",
    "<S> it clearly indicates that the coulomb crystal becomes more stiff at the bottom of the crust . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the density of the phonon spectrum is also modified as compared to the case of bare ion masses . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamic functions : the lattice thermal energy and the specific heat have been shown in the fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . one can notice that the renormalized values at a given density and temperature are smaller . </S>",
    "<S> in the limit of @xmath31 the analytic expressions for the ratios of lattice thermal energy @xmath32 and specific heat @xmath33 can be derived . applying the phenomenological relations from the ref.@xcite one </S>",
    "<S> gets : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the renormalized values of lattice energy and specific heat , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the following conclusions can be drawn from the presented results :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> there is a substantial renormalization effect of a nuclear / ion mass in the inner crust of a neutron star , due to the presence of a superfluid neutron liquid . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   consequently , the phonon spectrum and thermodynamic functions of the coulomb crystal are significantly altered . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> thermal and electric conductivities of the inner crust , governed by the electron - phonon scattering are expected to be modified . in particular , the contributions coming from umklapp processes have to be recalculated using the renormalized ion masses . </S>",
    "<S> 4 .   there is clearly a need for consideration of other nuclear degrees of freedom like e.g. shape vibrations , which may significantly modify the electron transport properties . </S>"
