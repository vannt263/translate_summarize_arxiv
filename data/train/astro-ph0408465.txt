    "the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation describes the strong correlation between luminosity and maximum rotation velocity for disc galaxies ( tully & fisher 1977 ) .",
    "this reflects a fundamental relationship between the total mass of the galaxy and the mass contained in stars .",
    "the redshift evolution of this scaling relation provides a powerful test of galaxy formation models .",
    "hierarchical models of galaxy formation predict that the ratio of stellar mass to total mass would be similar at all redshifts i.e. massive galaxies assembled through mergers of smaller galaxies .",
    "the ` classical ' galaxy formation models ( e.g. monolithic collapse ; eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ) predict a higher mass to light ratio at higher redshift , since the gas is still being converted to stars within the fully - formed dark matter halo .",
    "however , stellar population evolution might produce an offset in the opposite sense ( when based on observations at short rest - frame wavelength ) , since at high redshift a stellar population of identical mass is likely to be younger and therefore bluer than an equivalent population at low redshift .",
    "investigation of the evolution of the rest frame @xmath7-band tf relation at @xmath9 has to date produced discrepant results with observations of only moderate luminosity evolution of @xmath10 mag out to @xmath1 ( vogt et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) compared with claims of much stronger evolution of @xmath11 mag at @xmath12 ( simard & pritchet 1997 ; rix et al .",
    "previous high-@xmath13 work has so far been limited to long - slit spectroscopy , which has inherent problems - missing light through slit losses and possible misalignment of the slit , potentially leading to erroneous results for the rotation velocity if not addressed properly .",
    "however , the relatively new technique of 3d spectroscopy , used by andersen & bershady ( 2003 ) at low redshift , overcomes these difficulties . using an integral field unit ( ifu )",
    "we can efficiently obtain a complete census of the spatially extended line emission .",
    "we can potentially map disc kinematics at @xmath14 out to sufficiently large galactocentric radii to measure @xmath15 ( without need for correction ) , as well as obtaining more detailed information on the spatial distribution of emission line regions .    in this letter",
    "we present the first demonstration of near - ir integral field spectroscopy of a @xmath1 field galaxy , using our new cirpass instrument ( cambridge ir panoramic survey spectrograph , parry et al .",
    "2000 ) on gemini - south . by moving into the near - ir we were able to study the star formation in the @xmath8 galaxy cfrs 22.1313 ( lilly et al .",
    "1995b ) using the rest - optical h@xmath0 @xmath16 6563   emission line , the same reliable tracer of star formation as used at low redshift .",
    "we investigate the disc kinematics through the h@xmath0 line and compare the results found here using an ifu to previous work using traditional long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "the layout of this letter is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our target galaxy , the cirpass ifu observations and archival hst imaging . in section 3",
    "we discuss the distribution of star formation and the large - scale kinematics of the galaxy .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "we assume @xmath17 km s@xmath4mpc@xmath4 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 throughout this letter , unless otherwise stated .",
    "an angular scale of @xmath20 arcsec corresponds to a physical distance of 7.57 kpc at @xmath2 using the above cosmology .",
    "our target is the disc galaxy cfrs 22.1313 ( part of the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) - lilly et al .",
    "1995a ) and was specifically chosen for ifu study as it is spatially extended and has an accurately known redshift ( @xmath2 ) , for which h@xmath0 appears between sky lines .",
    "it also has strong [ oii ] @xmath16 3727  flux , which should imply detectable h@xmath0 emission ( kennicutt 1992 ) , and benefits from deep hst imaging from which the disc structural parameters may be derived . near - infrared integral field spectroscopy of cfrs 22.1313 was obtained with cirpass on gemini - south on the night of 2002 august 13 .",
    "cirpass is a fibre - fed spectrograph with a 490 lenslet array with a variable lenslet scale and operates in the @xmath21- and @xmath22-band ( @xmath20@xmath23 m ) .",
    "using the @xmath24 arcsec diameter lenslet scale for these observations the array covered an area of @xmath25 by @xmath26 arcsec .",
    "the detector is a 1k@xmath271k hawaii - i hgcdte rockwell array .",
    "the cirpass observations comprised eight separate 1800s integrations with a seeing of about @xmath28 arcsec .",
    "an eight - point dither pattern was used to facilitate sky subtraction and the removal of bad pixels .",
    "the spectra were taken using a 400 l mm@xmath4 grating with resolving power @xmath29 and dispersion 2.28  pix@xmath4 .",
    "the wavelength coverage was @xmath20@xmath30 m , targeting the redshifted h@xmath0 emission line , which appeared in a region free of oh sky emission lines .",
    "the data were reduced using the cirpass iraf packageoptics / cirpass / docs.html ] . for each 1800s integration",
    "the detector was read out non - destructively 20 times at the start of the integration and at 600s , 1200s and 1800s .",
    "the 20 multiple array reads are averaged for each loop to reduce read noise and adjacent loop averages are used to identify and reject cosmic rays .",
    "bias subtraction was also performed at this stage . since the target was stepped across different lenslets in the ifu for each of the eight observations , a sky frame was created for each exposure from the seven other integrations and this was used to perform first order sky subtraction .",
    "the spectra were then extracted using an optimal extraction algorithm ( johnson , dean & parry 2002 ) to account for crosstalk between adjacent spectra on the detector and to trace the curvature of the spectra from each fibre .",
    "the extracted spectra were flat - fielded using a dome flat , in order to remove the variation in throughput between fibres and the variation in sensitivity between pixels .",
    "the dome flat had previously been read - averaged , bias - subtracted and extracted .",
    "the data were wavelength calibrated using an argon lamp exposure , processed in the same way as the science data , again using optimal extraction .",
    "we used 17 argon lines and a quadratic fit to the dispersion , producing _ rms _ residuals of 0.2   ( 0.1 pix ) .",
    "residual sky - lines were removed by fitting a low - order polynomial function to the wavelength - rectified data frames .",
    "finally 3d ( x , y,@xmath16 ) data cubes were constructed for each integration before combining the eight individual exposures using the known telescope offsets .",
    "we observed two standard stars hip257 and hip106522 ( @xmath31 mag ) to determine the flux calibration ( these produced consistent calibrations ) .",
    "the observations of the standard stars were processed in the same way and used to flux calibrate the data cube .",
    "hst wfpc2 imaging was obtained from the archive ( programme go5996 , the cfrs survey ) .",
    "there were five @xmath32-band f814w exposures with a total exposure time of 6700s .",
    "we re - reduced the data from the archive starting with the pipeline processed ( flat - fielded and dark - subtracted ) individual exposures .",
    "these were then combined with integer pixel shifts determined from the world coordinate system and with cosmic ray rejection at the 3@xmath33 level .    the gim2d software package ( simard 1998 ; simard et al .",
    "1999 ) was used to determine an accurate inclination , flux and scale length for the galactic disc in the hst f814w image .",
    "the approach of gim2d is to convolve idealized two - dimensional galaxy models with the instrumental point spread function ( psf ) and to subtract this from the original two - dimensional ): as we are working in the rest - frame @xmath7-band at @xmath8 , the red bulge should produce negligible deviations from the fit of the exponential disc to the wfpc2 f814w @xmath32-band data .",
    "we excluded the two h  ii regions which were bright in the rest-@xmath7 ( section  [ sec : hiiregions ] ) from the gim2d fit to the surface brightness profile , by masking regions of width 0.5 arcsec centred on the two knots .",
    "we experimented with different mask sizes and found this did not significantly affect the disc parameters and these errors are included in the uncertainty in the rotation velocity .",
    "the galaxy centre , position angle on the sky , disc scale length , inclination and total flux were free parameters in the model .",
    "the best - fitting disc model from gim2d had a half - light radius of @xmath34 arcsec ( 10 kpc ) : the disc itself had a position angle on the sky of 74@xmath35 , the inclination to the line of sight was measured to be 78@xmath35 ( sin @xmath36 ) .",
    "the exponential disc scale length was 0.75@xmath37 arcsec ( 5.7@xmath38 kpc ) .",
    "nicmos nic2 imaging for this galaxy also exists .",
    "we have examined this and find that the centre determined from the @xmath22-band imaging ( which traces the older starlight ) agrees with the centre presented here .",
    "using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) the galaxy was found to have @xmath39 with the h  ii regions contributing @xmath6 25 per cent of the total flux .",
    "galactic extinction was determined using reddening @xmath400.05 from burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) .",
    "a correction of 0.88mag was made for the inclination - dependent internal extinction , including the residual absorption of a face - on galaxy ( 0.27mag ) , using the prescription of tully & fouqu ( 1985 ) with an optical depth @xmath410.55 .",
    "the magnitudes were adjusted by a small k - correction ( a dimming of 0.02mag for a sbc spiral template spectrum from coleman , wu & weedman 1980 ) to match the observed @xmath32-band to the rest - frame @xmath7-band .",

    "we note that the rest frame @xmath7 flux densities ( table [ table : hii ] ) would underestimate these star formation rates ( for the same imf ) by a factor of @xmath11 , which we attribute to the differential dust reddening between 4400 and 6563   or to the fact that the @xmath7-band flux , unlike h@xmath0 , is not a direct measurement of current star formation rate .",
