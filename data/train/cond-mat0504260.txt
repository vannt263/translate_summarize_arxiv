    "@xcite have studied percolation in the context of gauge theory .",
    "they considered the question of whether closed paths in three - dimensional percolation clusters are linked topologically to given closed loops , the so - called wilson loops . studying this problem for rectangular planar loops , and in comparison to percolation in three - dimensional slabs which they relate to the problem of deconfinement",
    ", the authors find a new universal amplitude ratio .",
    "this work provides an example where the percolation model possesses connections to fundamental problems in theoretical particle physics .",
    "gliozzi et al.s numerical results for rectangular loops of dimensions @xmath0 confirmed the expected behavior for @xmath1 @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the average probability that there is no path in any cluster linked to the wilson loop , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are constants that depend upon the percolation probability @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the dedekind function @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath10 , one expects @xmath11 because the linking probability should depend only upon the perimeter of the loop , while for @xmath12 , the linking probability is expected to decay exponentially with the area of the loop ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "taking @xmath6 somewhat above @xmath14 , gliozzi et al",
    ".  found that the dependence of @xmath5 upon @xmath6 behaves as @xmath15 similar to the behavior of a surface tension , where @xmath16 is the correlation - length exponent of 3-d percolation @xcite , and @xmath17 is a constant .",
    "they also determined the percolation threshold @xmath18 for slabs of thickness @xmath19 in the range 3  8 .",
    "one expects @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a constant , and indeed they find @xmath22 is a universal amplitude ratio with a value of about 1.50 .    in this note , we discuss two points related to the work of gliozzi et al . :",
    "( 1 ) we describe an epidemic or burning @xcite type of algorithm that may be simpler than the algorithm described by gliozzi et al . , and",
    "( 2 ) we apply it to study the linking probability exactly at @xmath14 ( a point that gliozzi et al .",
    "did not consider ) for 2-d and 3-d systems .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ weq ] ) and its 2-d analog are not necessarily expected to be valid at @xmath14 .",
    "gliozzi et al .  describe an algorithm that involves successive removal of dangling ends and reduction to an auxiliary graph that represents the connections between clusters on either side of the flat region enclosed by the loop .",
    "this graph is used to determine whether a cluster is linked to the loop .    here",
    "we describe a cluster burning type of algorithm that accomplishes the same test . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider the loop @xmath23 to be on the dual lattice , so effectively the problem is to find if there are clusters that simultaneously pass through the plane @xmath24 of vertical bonds enclosed by @xmath23 and through bonds in the same plane outside of @xmath23 .",
    "we are thinking of a simple cubic lattice to be specific .    to begin the process ,",
    "all of the sites are set to the  unvisited \" state and bonds to the  undetermined \" state",
    ". then we pick one of the ( unvisited ) sites @xmath25 directly above @xmath24 , and label that site as  visited \" with an arbitrary index @xmath26 .",
    "we check the six bonds that emanate from @xmath25 ; the undetermined bonds are made  occupied \" with probability @xmath6 and  vacant \" otherwise .",
    "for the bonds that are occupied , we check the adjacent site ; if that site is unvisited , we label it as visited ( with a value of the label described below ) and put its coordinates on a queue for future checking . after finishing checking all bonds connected to the site being studied",
    ", we consider the next site on the queue , continuing this process until the queue is empty .",
    "this is the normal burning or epidemic type of algorithm to identify a cluster connected to a site in bond percolation ; here we also decide whether a bond is occupied or not as we go along .",
    "we repeat this process for all remaining unvisited sites in the plane above @xmath24 .",
    "what we now do differently for the loop - linking problem is that we assign an index @xmath26 to each visited site in a cluster . when we transverse one of the occupied bonds that intersects @xmath24 , we increment @xmath26 by one when going downward or decrement it by one when going upwards . in this way",
    ", every site of the cluster will be labelled by @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( if a path of the growing cluster goes once through @xmath24 ) , @xmath28 ( if a path of the growing cluster winds twice through @xmath24 ) , etc .    now",
    ", if during the growing process a new bond is found to connect two visited sites with different labels @xmath29 , then the cluster must have wrapped around @xmath23 and is therefore linked to it .",
    "an occupied bond of course will not connect to sites of two different clusters , by definition , so therefore one does not have to worry about interference between clusters in this algorithm .",
    "here we have not dealt with the system boundaries .",
    "if open boundaries are used , care must be taken so that the boundary bonds are not mistaken for wrap - arounds . to eliminate this problem and to lessen the effects of the boundary",
    ", we considered periodic boundary conditions in all directions .",
    "this makes the problem slightly different , because periodic wraparounds through the wilson loop will also contribute to linking events , but if the lattice dimension @xmath30 , this difference should not be too significant . indeed , a moment s reflection shows that it is very unlikely that there will be wraparound without linking , since a cluster that wraps around the lattice it is usually a ubiquitous one and most likely will link the wilson loop also .",
    "the idea of adding a label to sites in percolation to test for a crossing criterion has been used previously in relation to wrapping a periodic system in a given direction @xcite .",
    "logarithm of @xmath31 (= the probability that no cluster encircles just one of the two points ) , vs.  the logarithm of the points separation @xmath32.,width=384 ]",
    "for the 2-d system , the question that is studied is whether there exists a closed path in a cluster that encircles one ( but not both ) of two points on the dual lattice , separated by a distance @xmath32 . in this case",
    "we can make a simple theoretical prediction for @xmath31 , since the condition of a path not encircling either of the two points individually is equivalent to the existence of a continuous path between the two points on the dual lattice  that is , a cluster that connects the two points .",
    "the density drop - off from any point on a given cluster goes as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the fractal dimension and @xmath35 is the spatial ( euclidean ) dimension . to find the probability that two given points are connected , the above factor must be multiplied by the probability the size of a cluster connected to one of the points is at least large enough to reach the other point . at criticality ,",
    "the probability that the number of sites connected to a point is equal to or greater than @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the size distribution exponent , and this implies that the probability that the radius is greater than or equal to @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 , since @xmath41 .",
    "then , by the hyperscaling relation @xmath42 , we have @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the net probability that two points separated by @xmath39 are connected by a cluster at @xmath14 is given by @xmath44 , implying that @xmath45 in @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we carried out simulations for this system using the algorithm described above .",
    "we considered bond percolation on the square lattice at @xmath49 , on a system with a square boundary of dimensions @xmath50 , and considered separations of the two points ranging between 10 and 100 .",
    "1 shows the results for a plot of @xmath51 vs.  @xmath52 , for a relatively small number of runs ( 100000 each ) .",
    "the slope is about @xmath53 , consistent with the theoretical prediction above . to make this work more precise",
    ", one would have to consider different size systems to study the finite size corrections , and perhaps also consider systems with open boundary conditions for comparison .",
    "upper ( @xmath54 ) : @xmath55 ) vs.  @xmath32 .",
    "lower ( @xmath56 ) : @xmath57 vs.  @xmath32 , which shows a good fit to a straight line for @xmath58 .",
    "the equation of the linear fit is given.,width=384 ]",
    "for the 3-d problem , we consider bond percolation on the simple cubic lattice , and take @xmath59 , which is an estimate for @xmath14 believed to be within about @xmath60 of the actual value @xcite .",
    "we consider a lattice of size @xmath61 , and square wilson loops containing @xmath62 vertical bonds , with @xmath63 . between 300,000 ( smaller @xmath32 ) and 13,000,000 samples ( larger @xmath32 )",
    "were generated for the different values of @xmath32 .    in fig .  2",
    ", the lower curve represents @xmath64 as a function of @xmath32 .",
    "the data shows quite linear behavior up to @xmath65 . evidently , the perimeter term proportional to @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ weq ] ) dominates ; as expected , there is no term proportional to the area .",
    "we do not see evidence of the @xmath67 term in eq .",
    "( [ weq ] ) .",
    "the data marked by circles in fig .  2 represents @xmath68 vs.  @xmath32 , and the fit to a straight line is much worse than for the case without the factor of @xmath69 .",
    "this factor would show up as a logarithmic term in the plot of fig .  2 .",
    "@xmath70 vs. @xmath32 for the 3-d data , showing deviations from simple exponential behavior .",
    "error bars show two standard deviations of statistical error.,width=384 ]    to check further for logarithmic terms , we plot in fig .",
    "3 the quantity @xmath70 , where the constant 0.0765 was adjusted to get the best horizontal region in the center , along with general monotonic behavior .",
    "we see two corrections to the straight line : for small @xmath32 , there is a small decrease , which could be fit to a very small logarithmic term , @xmath71 , much smaller than the @xmath72 term that would appear for @xmath12 according to eq .",
    "( [ weq ] ) .",
    "the coefficient is so small that the existence of a logarithmic term seems unlikely .    for large @xmath32 ,",
    "the deviations from linearity are also small , which is surprising given that we went up to @xmath73 in a system of size @xmath74 .",
    "when @xmath32 approaches @xmath75 it should be more difficult to create a linking clusters , because there is a smaller region external to the loop ( also taking into account the periodic b.c . ) , but this may be balanced by the increase in vertical wraparounds ( which our algorithm takes to be linkages ) through the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "note that at @xmath65 , @xmath76  that is , only 3434 of the 12,000,000 samples did not have a linkage to the wilson loop .",
    "thus , ignoring the possible small logarithmic term , the data for 3-d ( in the central range ) yields @xmath77 , implying @xmath78 or @xmath79 for bond percolation on the simple cubic lattice at criticality .",
    "note the linear fit for @xmath80 above is somewhat different than that given in fig .  2 , which is just a simple linear fit through all the data points .",
    "we see that a simple burning type of algorithm can be constructed to find the loop linking probability studied by gliozzi et al . we have checked it in two dimensions at the critical threshold , where the linking probability is known exactly by virtue of its being dual to the two point probability .",
    "of course , in 2d one can easily simulate the dual problem of connecting the two points .",
    "however , in 3d , where a dual - lattice procedure would be much more complicated , a direct determination is preferable and the algorithm presented here is efficient and simple . for 3d",
    ", we find a simple exponential relation between @xmath81 and @xmath32 reflecting a perimeter effect ; there is no evidence of a logarithmic correction implied by the @xmath67 term in eq .",
    "( [ weq ] ) ( which is not necessarily expected to be valid at @xmath14 ) or as suggested by the behavior in 2d .",
