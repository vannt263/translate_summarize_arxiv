    "the large area telescope ( lat , * ? ? ? * ) of the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ has now detected more than 150 pulsars , extending over six orders of magnitude in spin - down luminosity and divided roughly evenly between young ` normal ' pulsars and ` recycled ' millisecond pulsars ( msps ) .",
    "the ` normal ' population is further roughly equally divided into radio - loud and radio - quiet / radio - faint pulsars .",
    "see the 2nd pulsar catalog ( 2pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for a detailed analysis .",
    "this bonanza both probes the high - energy emission mechanism and offers selection effects appreciably different to those of radio surveys .",
    "e.g. , the sensitivity of ` blind searches'efforts to detect @xmath5-ray pulsations without _ a priori _ information about the period  for young pulsars suffers in the bright diffuse background of the galactic plane @xcite , while is particularly good at selecting msp candidates whose pulsations can be detected with deep radio telescopes searches ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "important properties of pulsars , such as their frequency @xmath0 , their spin - down rate , their position and proper motion , and their orbital parameters , can be determined through pulsar timing .",
    "this procedure  as old as pulsars themselves @xcite  both measures pulse times of arrival ( toas ) and models their generation and propagation so as to coherently account for every rotation of the neutron star .",
    "measuring these parameters is key to understanding the distribution of pulsars within the galaxy .",
    "moreover , deviations from expectations often yield new insights , e.g. pulse nulling over very long time - scales ( intermittency ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , correlated shifts in pulse profile and spin - down luminosity @xcite , and dramatic , rapid shifts in magnetospheric configuration @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented the discovery of the first state switch observed in -rays , in which an abrupt increase of the spin - down rate of psr  j2021@xmath64026 was accompanied by both a decrease in total flux and change in pulse shape .",
    "the efficacy of pulsar timing is reduced by timing noise ( tn ) , a red noise process first recognized by @xcite .",
    "tn is intrinsic to pulsar rotation and operates over a broad range of time - scales .",
    "it is generally strongest in young pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with noise processes whose amplitudes can be far larger than the pulsar period ( @xmath71s ) , while tn in msps is much weaker , with amplitudes of order 1@xmath8s . because tn can not be modelled _ a priori _ , it confuses the deterministic signature of other parameters of interest . on the other hand , if tn can be definitely related to a particular physical mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it provides another means of understanding neutron stars and their magnetospheres .    for pulsars ,",
    "tn is the primary obstacle to identifying counterparts at other wavelengths . because the angular resolution of the lat is coarse compared to focusing telescopes",
    ", determining the counterpart of a -ray source typically requires the detection of correlated temporal variability @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "pulsar timing offers an essentially interferometric localization with a baseline of up to 1au , with position errors inducing an annual sinusoidal modulation in the pulse toas .",
    "tn obscures and corrupts this signal , but a data set spanning years has multiple realizations of both the sinusoid and the annual - scale fluctuations of the noise process , allowing the signals to be disentangled .",
    "thus , it behooves us to collect long sets of precise toas for each detected -ray pulsar .",
    "as with modelling tn , measuring toas with also presents challenges .",
    "the lat only collects a few photons per day from a typical -ray pulsar , and measurement of a single toa requires integrations ranging from hours to months .",
    "sources are embedded in the strong diffuse background and are sometimes confused with bright neighboring sources ; both situations require sophisticated spectral modelling to optimize the pulsar signal .",
    "finally , the lat pulsar sample includes many young , energetic pulsars with strong tn and glitches .",
    "glitches are sudden step changes in @xmath0 and , often with a transient component in which the increased spin - down rate `` recovers '' nearly to the pre - glitch value ; see e.g. @xcite for a large sample of examples .",
    "all told , during the time required to obtain a single toa , the phase of the neutron star may have drifted considerably , and one finds oneself in the unenviable position of needing the timing model to measure the timing model !    with the large pulsar population and the steady acquisition of more than five years of all - sky data , we are now in a position to better address both tn and toa measurements . building on the work of @xcite , we have developed a suite of techniques for reliably measuring toas from data with maximum likelihood . by applying a relatively new approach ,",
    "in which tn is modelled as correlations among toas ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter c11 ) , we are able to accurately measure the tn component and obtain unbiased estimates for pulsar timing parameters .",
    "we have incorporated these techniques into a pipeline which provides updated timing solutions and toas for all -ray pulsars above a nominal flux threshold .",
    "these products  including , for the first time , toas  are freely available to the community .",
    "we expect them to be of interest to researchers for a variety of topics , including the construction of detailed folded light curves , population analyses , and searches for state changes .",
    "we introduce the timing sample and the reduction of -ray and radio data in  [ sec : sample ] , [ sec : lat_reduction ] , and [ sec : radio_reduction ] , respectively .",
    "we describe the maximum likelihood - based timing pipeline and resulting data products in  [ sec : pulsar_timing ] and  [ sec : pipeline ] . in ",
    "[ sec : ml ] , we discuss in detail our approach to measuring tn . with those results , we present an analysis of tn in the -ray pulsar population (  [ sec : model_selection ] and  [ sec : measurements ] ) , in particular characterizing the strength and shape of the tn spectrum . finally , we demonstrate the power of our method by determining reliable , precise timing positions for the sample in  [ sec : astrometry ] . where appropriate",
    ", we discuss results _ in situ_.",
    "our approximately flux - limited sample comprises pulsars , including 36 radio - quiet or radio - faint pulsars which are too dim to time with modern radio telescopes , viz .",
    "psrs  j1124@xmath45916 and j1907@xmath60602 .",
    "this sample represents a marked increase over the 16 pulsars characterized in @xcite , with gains coming from both a larger pool of detected -ray pulsars and a flux threshold lower by a factor of about five .",
    "the basic criterion for selection is that the pulse is reliably detected in the toa integration interval .",
    "we selected as our maximum interval a span of 56 days which is approximately the precessional period of the spacecraft , on which the exposure to a source cycles .",
    "because sharp pulses are more easily detected than broad ones , this detectability criterion does not translate directly into a flux cutoff .",
    "empirically , if a pulsar can generate a weighted @xmath9-test statistic @xcite of @xmath1015 , about 3@xmath11 , during a given interval , it can be timed reliably at that cadence .",
    "we based our thresholds on the 2pc weighted @xmath9-test values , computed with three years of data : for a cadence of 56 days , pulsars reaching @xmath9@xmath10250 in three years satisfy the detection criterion .",
    "we were unable to obtain phase - connected timing solutions for a few pulsars surpassing this threshold , viz .",
    "j1838@xmath40537 , j0554@xmath63107 , j1810@xmath61744 , and j2043@xmath62740 , and these pulsars are excluded from the sample .",
    "these timing solutions may be recovered with unbinned timing techniques , improved event reconstruction , and/or contributions of radio toas .",
    "we conclude with a few remarks on our choice of maximum cadence . as we describe below , extraction of a toa",
    "requires a timing solution valid over the course of the integration period . in the case of young pulsars , both tn and glitches are prohibitive of long integration periods , with our experience leading us to adopt 56 days . on the other hand , msps , with their much more stable rotation ,",
    "can benefit from even longer integration periods , effectively lowering the sample flux threshold .",
    "however , these longer integration periods prohibit timing of short time - scale features , e.g. the orbital period , requiring ancillary observations from radio telescopes to provide initial characterization .",
    "ultimately , these issues demand an unbinned analysis , in which the timing model is fitted directly to photon timestamps .",
    "because pulsar timing machinery is based on the concept of toa , such a switch represents a major task for future workers .",
    "we analyze 5.2 years of source - class pass 7 lat data acquired between 2008 aug 4 ( met 239557418 ) and 2013 oct 21 ( met 404063018 ) .",
    "we note that these data are `` unreprocessed '' ( cf .",
    "* ) , but that the improved properties of the reprocessed data have little benefit for pulsar timing .",
    "the data span nearly the entire period of the uniform all - sky survey , terminating only a month before the switch into a modified survey mode with enhanced exposure to the galactic center and modestly compromised exposure elsewhere .    using _ gtmktime _",
    "( science tools version 09 - 31 - 02 ) , we filtered events lying outside the good time intervals defined by the -lat team , which exclude the regular passages through the south atlantic anomaly and transient events such as bright solar flares .",
    "we also reject events when the rocking angle of the spacecraft exceeds @xmath12 and those with a zenith angle @xmath7100@xmath13 ; these cuts primarily eliminate background from -rays generated along the earth s limb . to further reduce the background , primarily from the bright galactic diffuse emission",
    ", we apply photon weighting @xcite with _",
    "gtsrcprob _ using the ` p7source_v6 ` instrument response function .",
    "the photon weights ( see  [ sec : pulsar_timing ] for application ) are estimates of the probability that a given event arrives from the pulsar instead of the background , and require an estimate for the spectrum of each . for most pulsars ,",
    "we use the 2pc spectral and background models . for four additional pulsars discovered in blind searches , psrs  j0554@xmath63107 , j1422@xmath46138 , j1522@xmath45735 , j1932@xmath61916",
    ", we use the spectral models derived in @xcite .",
    "although spectral models may be derived with different data sets and instrumental representations than those employed here , the photon weights needed for timing analysis do not depend sensitively on the precision of the model @xcite .",
    "finally , we select photons within 2@xmath14 of the pulsar position with reconstructed energies lying between 100mev and 30gev . where required , we make use of the _ fermi _ plugin for tempo2 @xcite to assign pulse phase to these photons .      for a subset of our pulsars",
    ", we have obtained high - quality timing data from radio telescopes , primarily from ongoing programs to monitor high-@xmath15 pulsars in support the mission @xcite .",
    "most data come from the parkes campaign @xcite and were reduced via a pipeline that performs polarimetric calibration and impulsive and narrowband rfi excision ; the raw data are available through the csiro data archive portal @xcite .",
    "two msps ( j1902@xmath45105 and j1514@xmath44946 ) discovered in a parkes survey were monitored for two years and we include the toas , produced and reduced as per @xcite , in our sample .    two young pulsars , j1747@xmath42958 and j1833@xmath41034 , are visible to parkes but too dim to be reliably timed .",
    "these were monitored with the green bank telescope for three years , and we likewise include these data .",

    ", toas can be obtained with observations generally lasting less than an hour , a time - scale on which tn is negligible .",
    "the resulting pulse profiles follow gaussian statistics even in the low s / n case . measuring a toa",
    "is then simply a matter of cross - correlation with a known template .",
    "in contrast , the lat data may comprise only a few source photons atop a strong background .",
    "a proper description of the data requires poisson statistics , and measuring a toa is achieved through analysis of the likelihood profile as we describe below .    in measuring toas",
    ", we follow the method of @xcite with a few refinements .",
    "we use a weighted version of the likelihood , i.e. the probability density to observe a photon with phase @xmath53 given a pulse template @xmath54 is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the photon weight computed above (  [ sec : lat_reduction ] ) . for toas with modest significance ,",
    "the likelihood profile is often asymmetric , indicating the statistical uncertainty on the resulting toa is also asymmetric .",
    "however , standard pulsar timing software , like the tempo2 package we use , is predicated on gaussian statistics and symmetric error bars .",
    "thus , instead of simply using the likelihood maximum to measure a toa , we determine a phase interval bounded by @xmath57 and we use the center of this interval and one - half of its width as estimators for the toa and its uncertainty .",
    "we show an example for psr  j0030@xmath60451 in figure [ fig : logl ] .",
    "further , in order to avoid spurious toa measurements , we require that the absolute value of the log likelihood exceeds five , a threshold we have determined empirically to work well . if there are multiple significant peaks in the likelihood , as is often the case for profiles with peaks separated by about half a rotation , we choose the peak closest to that predicted by the ephemeris",
    ".    we finally note that toa extraction is an iterative process . determing the photon phase @xmath53 over a toa interval",
    "requires a valid timing solution , but this in turn requires a set of toas from which to determine a timing solution .",
    "we begin with an initial ephemeris that accurately tracks the pulsar rotational phase for some span of time ( e.g. over three years from 2pc ) , and we extract toas using the method of @xcite . the integration period for each toa , which is uniform for a particular pulsar , varies from one week for the brightest pulsars in our sample to 56 days for the dimmest ( see tables [ tab : overview_normal ] and [ tab : overview_msp ] ) .    using the initial solution and toas , we jointly fit a new timing solution and a model for timing noise using the cholesky factorization / generalized least squares method of c11 ( see  [ sec : tn ] ) . using the covariance matrix predicted by the best - fit tn model",
    ", we evaluate the tn process in the time domain with critical sampling ( twice the toa cadence ) .",
    "see @xcite for a similar application . with this new timing solution",
    "we extrapolate the pulse phase to the next interval of data and extract a new toa . by repeating this process for each time step , we bootstrap a self consistent timing solution and set of toas .",
    "we model glitches as sudden discontinuities in the spin - down model : @xmath58\\big\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the glitch epoch , @xmath60 is the heaviside function , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are permanent changes in the frequency and spin - down rate and @xmath63 is a transient increase in the frequency exponentially decaying with time - scale @xmath64 .",
    "new glitches are relatively easy to identify , as the pre - glitch timing solution will no longer produce a visible pulse profile when applied to post - glitch data .",
    "when we note such an occurrence , we estimate the epoch and then use unbinned likelihood to estimate the glitch parameters directly from the photon timestamps , fitting data collected for 90d before and 180d after the glitch .",
    "empirically , we find that a subset of these parameters suffice to model the set of glitches",
    ". however , we also note that ( 1 ) generally we can not access transient components with time - scales less than a few days ( 2 ) parameter estimates are affected by tn .",
    "joint fitting of the glitch parameters and the tn model is beyond the current capability of our analysis and we leave this effort for future work , noting that the impact of fitting the glitch parameters independently does not appear to substantially alter the tn properties ( see  [ sec : spectrum ] ) .",
    "once we have a timing solution spanning the full data set , we generate a new pulse profile and fit an analytic pulse template as described in 2pc .",
    "these templates are based on the 2pc models to which we have added minor components to model new features present in our augmented data set . for consistency , we use this new pulse profile to re - extract toas and fit a new timing solution .",
    "although this ` self standarding ' can lead to underestimates of toa uncertainty ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we expect the effect to be minimal here because ( 1 ) we use an analytic template ( 2 ) our fitting is in the time domain .      for each pulsar ,",
    "the principal products of the pipeline are toas at an optimal cadence , a timing solution including a model of tn , and a pulse profile .",
    "these products  along with diagnostic plots  are public@xmath65 and generally updated every few months .",
    "the tn model , discussed below , is characterized by critically sampling its time domain realization ( twice per toa ) .",
    "this sampling is encoded in the timing solution via a set of ` ifunc ` values , which specify the fixed points of a time series between which tempo2 interpolates linearly . to compare these timing solutions with other published ephemerides and light curves , note that @xmath66 in our timing solutions corresponds to the leftmost bin of the corresponding profile .",
    "+    characterization of tn requires some model for the noise process .",
    "historically , these models have included a taylor expansion of the red noise realization through and higher derivatives , and/or through harmonically related sinusoids ( ` fitwaves ` , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with this approach , which models the realization of the noise process in the time domain ,",
    "the measured toas remain statistically independent and maximum likelihood analysis is equivalent to weighted least squares ( i.e. , the covariance matrix is diagonal ) .",
    "unfortunately , c11 established that such ad hoc models of tn heavily bias other timing parameters , and instead those authors propose that the red noise process be modelled as widesense stationary , that is , that the correlations between toas are independent of time .",

    "by which we mean the model reproduces the correlations observed in the toa time series  then the above method provides optimal estimators for the timing parameters .",

    "they employed a spectral analysis of the residuals to the spin - down model to estimate these three parameters .",
    "the corner frequency was to some extent empirical because their fit was to the residuals , from which a quadratic term ( viz .",
    "low frequency power ) had already been removed by fitting @xmath0 and ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we also adopt this model for tn , but as we are interested both in the properties of the tn as well as its impact on other parameters , we choose to fit the tn parameters jointly with the spin - down model .",
    "this requires retaining the normalization term in the gaussian likelihood ; that is , denoting the stochastic tn parameters @xmath75 and the pulsar spin - down parameters @xmath76 , we obtain parameter estimates by minimizing the quantity @xmath77 moreover , we require the covariance matrix for the red noise process to be positive definite , in which case the total covariance matrix is necessarily positive definite , and we apply the cholesky factorization @xmath78 , with @xmath79 a lower triangular matrix .",
    "thus , @xmath80 reduces to @xmath81 , and the `` @xmath82 '' term can be written as @xmath83 . for many pulsars with strong timing noise ,",
    "the condition number of @xmath70 is untenably large and the cholesky factorization greatly aids numerical stability .    to maximize @xmath84 and characterize parameter uncertainties , we use monte carlo markov chain sampling via ` emcee ` @xcite . for each proposed realization of power law parameters",
    "@xmath85 , we compute the covariance matrix for the @xmath86 unique lags by computing the fourier transform of @xmath1 ; see @xcite for an analytic expression of the transform and note that this is essentially the well - known matrn covariance function . if the matrix is positive definite , we factor it as described above .",
    "otherwise we reject the sample .",
    "next , we use the proposed set of spin - down parameters @xmath87 together with tempo2 to compute the residuals @xmath69 . finally , we compute @xmath84 and return it to ` emcee ` to let it determine whether or not to accept the sample .    because we have very little knowledge of the tn model",
    "_ a priori _ , we adopt broad priors on @xmath85 by sowing the ` emcee ` `` walkers '' over a parameter space encompassing a large range of tn strengths and spectral shapes .",
    "specifically , we use a prior uniform in the logarithm of @xmath88 from @xmath89 to @xmath90 , a uniform prior on @xmath73 from 2 to 10 , and a uniform prior on the logarithm of @xmath72 from @xmath91 to @xmath92 , with units on @xmath88 of s@xmath93d and units on @xmath72 of d@xmath94 .",
    "conversely , the timing model parameters are generally highly constrained , and we seed the walkers over a narrow parameter space centered on values from a tempo2 fit with width of order the formal statistical uncertainties from the ordinary least squares fit .",
    "we then allow a lengthy burn - in for the walkers to `` forget '' their initial conditions and explore the covariance between @xmath85 and @xmath87 .",
    "as long as the posterior distribution does not pile up on a boundary , we find our results are insensitive to the volume of the parameter space .",
    "we employ a basic spin - down model , fitting only @xmath0 and , save for the crab pulsar , where is dynamically important and we also allow it to vary . for other pulsars , we fix @xmath95 , i.e. assign a braking index of 3 . for crab , we include @xmath96 likewise fixed by the braking index prescription .",
    "if an arcsecond - precision position is not available from _ chandra _ , optical telescopes , or vlbi measurements ( see  [ sec : astrometry ] ) , or if the implied timing precision is much better than that of the multi - wavelength position , we also allow the position to vary . in figure",
    "[ fig : fitting ] , we show one example where the systematic errors associated with an atca position for psr  j1028@xmath45819 are clearly revealed in the timing analysis . finally , the distribution of samples from ` emcee ` provide estimates of uncertainty on @xmath97 .",
    "if we have included radio toas , we fit an additional arbitrary phase offset between the and radio toas .    after this process , we have likelihood - maximizing parameters for the spin - down and tn model , but we still lack a time - domain realization of the noise process with which to generate a set of whitened residuals and thus an optimal timing solution . @xcite",
    "derive a maximum likelihood estimator for the noise process , but we find the required matrix inversion to be numerically unstable for pulsars with strong tn . instead , we once again adopt an iterative process . according to the karhunen - love theorem ,",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath70 are an optimal basis for an expansion of the noise process , and the coefficients of the expansion can be estimated by ordinary least squares to the timing residuals .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite for an overview of karhunen - love decomposition in an astronomical context . )",
    "we then approximate the noise process as a truncated karhunen - love expansion , adding terms to the expansion until the fit becomes acceptable , i.e. the @xmath82 per degree of freedom is close to 1 .",
    "this procedure is similar to that of fitwaves , but we use a basis optimized to the noise process rather than a general harmonic basis .",
    "this realization of the noise process is included via linear interpolation in the publicly - available ephemerides .",
    "although fitting @xmath0 and suppresses tn at time - scales comparable to the observation length ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is interesting to see if the joint fitting process preserves any evidence in support of noise processes with spectra well - described by power laws .",
    "we explore this by repeating the fitting process described above for a series of nested models in which    1 .",

    "we apply the akaike information criterion @xcite , which requires @xmath105 to accept a model with an additional degree of freedom .",
    "the resulting classification for each pulsar appears in tables [ tab : overview_normal ] and [ tab : overview_msp ] , and in figure [ fig : comp_class_edot ] .",
    "every young pulsar provides evidence for at least some level of tn , and for the vast majority , the preferred model is a broken power law .",
    "curiously , the pulsars for which a pure power law ( case 3 above ) is optimal are mostly energetic , glitching pulsars .",
    "because the glitches are not fit jointly with the tn or other spin parameters , they have a complicated effect on the spectrum .",
    "a data span @xmath106 ( 270d ) is used to determine the glitch parameters , and tn power with frequencies @xmath7@xmath107 will be reduced by the glitch fitting . on the other hand , inaccuracies in the permanent glitch parameters ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 in eq .",
    "[ eq : glitch ] ) appear as a step with asymptoptic spectrum @xmath108 .",
    "since this is much less steep than the intrinsic spectrum , however , the effect on the measured spectrum should be minor .",
    "since pure power laws are preferred for glitching pulsars , this seems to be the case .    with one exception , at most a pure power law with fixed spectral index ( case 2 )",
    "is required to model the tn in msps .",
    "in fact , since the predicted red noise level ( see below ) is largely below the statistical precision of our toas , it is likely most of this `` timing noise '' is simply absorbing deficiencies in our white noise models , e.g. the likelihood asymmetry described in  [ sec : ml ] .",
    "this interpretation is reinforced in the case of psr  j1231@xmath41411 , which is the brightest known msp , and thus least affected by issues with low statistical significance .",
    "its optimal model requires no tn at all ( case 0 ) .",
    "substantial progress has been made in understanding the properties and underlying mechanisms of timing noise through the study of large samples of pulsars timed over many years , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the collection of pulsars timed here is comparable in both size and duration to many of these studies .",
    "moreover , since the beams of -ray pulsars illuminate more of the sky than those of radio pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the lat sample may offer a less biased view of high-@xmath15 pulsars .",
    "both circumstances motivate an analysis and discussion of two key tn metrics , viz its strength and its spectral shape .",
    "the strength of tn is a key parameter , as it sets the physical scale of the underlying noise process(es ) and limits the precision with which deterministic parameters can be measured .",
    "several metrics are available , including the best - fit value of @xmath109 , the rms ( root mean square ) after fitting a low - order polynomial , and the @xmath74 parameter of eq .",
    "[ eq : power_law ] .",
    "because the latter is highly correlated with @xmath72 , we adopt as a proxy for tn strength the integral timing noise @xmath110 or , equivalently , the zero - lag element of the time - domain covariance . to account for the statistical uncertainty in this quantity ,",
    "we compute it using each entry of our markov chain and report the mode and 68% central interval as a function of @xmath15 in figure [ fig : tnedot ] .",
    "as extensively noted in the literature , as well as in our sample , the tn strength is highly correlated with and mildly correlated with @xmath0 , e.g. @xcite , though see also @xcite . for uniformity of presentation",
    ", we use @xmath15 as a proxy for and other combinations of @xmath0 and .",
    "interestingly , the crab pulsar ( j0534@xmath62200 ) shows an anomalously low tn amplitude . among young and energetic pulsars , it is unique in its proclivity for small glitches with complex recoveries @xcite , and it is no surprise its tn properties are out of family .",
    "moreover , the crab is the only pulsar for which we fit @xmath109 .    by examining a large sample of pulsars",
    ", @xcite identified a single relation spanning msps , young pulsars , and magnetars : @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the rms scatter of the toa residuals after fitting for @xmath0 and , with the subscript reminding that the model includes two and only two spin - down terms .",
    "measurements of @xmath112 for the pulsar population and the predictions of @xcite are shown in figure [ fig : rms_plot ] ; observations in agreement with the relation lie along the diagonal dashed line .",
    "these values are obtained by measuring the rms scatter relative to a timing solution with @xmath0 and and for which the best - fit noise process is either included in the model ( `` white rms '' ) or excluded from the model ( `` total rms '' ) .",
    "generally , the total rms ( colored points in figure [ fig : rms_plot ] ) dwarfs the white rms ( white points ) for young pulsars , and the former can be taken as a proxy of the rms due to tn .",
    "however , as measurement noise becomes important , the two quantities approach equality , and we can not reliably estimate the tn contribution . although the values are in reasonable agreement with the fit , the lat sample shows a steeper dependence on , more in keeping with the @xmath113 relation found by @xcite in a fit to only typical unrecycled pulsars . in both cases ,",
    "the white noise level of the msp sample is well above the tn prediction .",
    "it is interesting to compare our model - derived metric ( figure [ fig : tnedot ] ) with the sample rms in the case where we do not model tn .",
    "we expect that the primary difference will be the joint fit of the tn model with @xmath0 and , potentially allowing more noise to be associated with the tn model . indeed , in figure [ fig : comp_rms_ampl ]",
    ", we observe a tight but nonlinear correlation , with the tn predicted by our fit growing more quickly than the sample rms .",
    "the crab pulsar lies more in trend with the @xmath112 metric , which likely reflects the inclusion of a dynamic in the fit with which the tn amplitude is obtained .      the second important property of tn  and the one that offers insight into the physical mechanism(s)is the degree of correlation over long time - scales , or equivalently , the steepness of the power spectrum of the toa residuals .",
    "like the amplitude parameter , @xmath73 is highly correlated with @xmath72 , and we prefer an empirical measure . we adopt the time required for the correlation to drop to one half of its peak ( zero lag ) value , which we call the correlation time - scale , and as before we make use of the monte carlo sampling to estimate values and uncertainties .",
    "these results appear in figure [ fig : comp_corr_tn ] and show a very marked `` redder when stronger '' relation . discounting the msps ,",
    "the relationship is nearly a power law , though there is evidence for a break around 5yr , the length of the data set , @xmath104 .",
    "correlation time - scales @xmath114 are of course extrapolations and can be interpreted as statements that the data exhibit strong correlations over the entire range of observations . because we only have one realization of the data with frequencies @xmath115 , and because this portion of the spectrum dominates the total tn for steep spectra , precise characterization of these quantities at these time - scales is not possible .    interestingly ,",
    "though , this `` saturation '' time - scale is also the time - scale at which most pulsars experience strong glitches , so it is unclear if the saturation is due to glitches or absorption of red noise by @xmath0 and . because the correlation time - scale is so strongly correlated with the tn amplitude , it is likewise strongly correlated with @xmath15 , as seen in figure [ fig : corr_timescale_edot ] .    as with tn strength , it is worth comparing our choice of the correlation time - scale with other metrics of the tn spectrum .",
    "the obvious choice , @xmath73 , is directly comparable to spectral analyses based on fourier transforms , though we note the method employed here is immune to spectral leakage and we easily recover extremely steep spectra : our measurements of @xmath73 appear in figure [ fig : alpha_edot ] .",
    "however , because of the correlation with @xmath72 , @xmath73 does not tell the full story and the strong correlation with @xmath15 has vanished .",
    "indeed , the most energetic pulsars may show a decrease in spectral index ! in the time domain ,",
    "on the other hand , the correlation increases monotonically with @xmath15 .",
    "we thus caution that , in studies of tn of young pulsars , careful attention should be paid to the metric employed .    on the other hand ,",
    "the use of @xmath73 allows us to make better contact with the literature . in the earliest studies of timing noise , it was realized that ( under the assumption that the ` step rate ' is fast enough ) , simple random walk processes would manifest as power law spectra . in particular , for a random walk in phase , @xmath116 ; for @xmath0 , @xmath117 ; and for , @xmath118 . in a famous example",
    ", @xcite determined the spectral index of the crab pulsar , based on two years of timing data , to be @xmath119 , consistent with our results here , and proposed its noise was largely ` frequency jitter ' .",
    "however , the majority of our pulsars show much steeper spectra , with typical values of 67 for the most energetic , glitching pulsars , and a broad range 59 for less energetic glitching and non - glitching young pulsars .",
    "as noted before , the tn properties of the msps in our sample are poorly constrained .",
    "we conclude this section with a few remarks on the interplay between glitches and the ( possibly ) smooth noise process(es ) . in the case of large , resolved glitches",
    ", we expect we may be able to cleanly separate the effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and indeed we observe no systematic differences between the glitching and non - glitching populations save the ` normal ' evolution with @xmath15 and a tendency to favor pure power laws . on the other hand , while @xcite clearly show a minimum threshold for glitch amplitudes of the crab pulsar , there is no corresponding result for the general population , and glitch amplitudes may stretch well into the ` measurement noise ' resulting from both toa precision and cadence .",
    "indeed , @xcite found ` microglitches ' to be an important factor in tn .",
    "these episodic jumps in @xmath0 and were too large to be consistent with high - rate stochastic processes but were too small and with the incorrect sign for @xmath61 to be true glitches .",
    "such events are of particular concern for the lat : they may be the hallmark of mode changes @xcite , but the typical toa precision and cadence are poor for many pulsars .",
    "a thorough analysis of this phenomenon requires new capabilities to jointly model glitches and tn , as well as to determine the sensitvity of to the former .",
    "we leave this challenging task to future work .",
    "pulsar timing can furnish extremely precise positions relative to the dynamical frame of the solar system ephemeris , in this work typically realized by jpl de405 . for psrs",
    "j0437@xmath44715 and j2241@xmath45236 , we use the de414 ephemeris , while for psrs  j1057@xmath45226 and j2043@xmath61711 we make use of the de421 ephemeris . while small errors from frame transfer or from clock drifts are important for msp positions , the dominant source of error for young pulsars is bias from tn ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for multi - wavelength followup  e.g .",
    "deep searches for radio pulsations or x - ray searches for point sources  accurate positions with robust uncertainties are required .    here",
    ", we show that our models of tn , together with monte carlo sampling ( described above ) , provide the needed level of accuracy . to estimate the timing position uncertainties , we compute the monte carlo sample covariance in r.a . and decl",
    ", obtaining the position error ellipse marginalized over all other parameters .",
    "typically , correlation in r.a . and decl . is small , and we simply report the 68% ( `` 1@xmath11 '' ) containment intervals for each coordinate .    to check these uncertainty estimates in the case of normal pulsars ( affected by tn ) ,",
    "we have collected from the literature all available precisely - measured pulsar positions , primarily from _ chandra _ observations , but including some vlbi measurements and optical observations .",
    "we have intentionally excluded positions available from pulsar timing as they are subject to the same potential biases as our analysis .",
    "the positions , along with their provenance and uncertainty , are given in tables [ tab : overview_normal ] and [ tab : overview_msp ] .",
    "position uncertainties , in particular , are heterogeneous , as the level of analysis ranges from none to a careful accounting of uncertainties due to photon counting , pointing aspect solution , and frame tie .",
    "for msps , the only positions with sufficient precision to be useful for comparison are obtained with vlbi , and we do not report positions with lesser precision .    to compare the timing positions with the independent literature positions , we referenced all timing positions to mjd 55555 , while , for sources with reliable proper motions , we advanced the independent positions to the same epoch .",
    "the resulting coordinate differences , scaled to @xmath120 , i.e. the errors added in quadrature , are shown in figure [ fig : pulls ] . the errors cluster within one unit without piling up at the origin , indicating that the timing position ellipse overlaps the multi - wavelength one without being overly conservative .",
    "likewise , the data indicate no additional component of proper motion to within our measurement precision .",
    "the one significant outlier is geminga ( psr  j0633@xmath61746 ) , whose decl . is in agreement but whose r.a . differs by 5@xmath11 . here ,",
    "its absolute r.a .",

    "this differs from the position by @xmath126 , or @xmath127 .",
    "accounting for the discrepancy requires either a 15% systematic error on the measured proper motion , or a systematic error of 300mas in the optical frame tie ; the latter seems more likely .",
    "the statistical uncertainty estimates for our positions are clearly sufficiently accurate .",
    "moreover , we can limit the absolute level of any systematic error within our timing chain itself by comparing the -only timing position of msps with precise vlbi positions . in the case of psr  j0437@xmath44715 ,",
    "the timing position is in perfect agreeement with the 1-mas precision vlbi position of @xcite , limiting any systematic errors to @xmath3010mas .",
    "several -lat msp positions have @xmath10mas precision , e.g. j0614@xmath43329 and j1231@xmath41411 ( and see figure [ fig : comp_rms_raj ] ) , but those sources currently lack vlbi positions for comparison .    although the positions above are unbiased , it is interesting to explore the degree to which tn degrades the possible precision . in figure",
    "[ fig : comp_rms_raj ] , we show the estimated precision in the r.a .",
    "coordinate as a function of both the total and white - only rms .",
    "in general , the msps and a few of the less energetic young pulsars track the ideal relation of @xmath128 .",
    "on the other hand , when tn becomes important , the position precision worsens by orders of magnitude .",
    "interestingly , if we instead examine the precision as a function of the sample rms , which includes the effects of tn , we see that the position uncertainty is still highly correlated with the rms , but with an approximate @xmath129 relation .",
    "essentially , the tn has destroyed the coherence of the position measurement .",
    "thus , in the tn - dominated rgime , we expect the position uncertainty to only improve as @xmath130 , while those pulsars free of tn ( relative to the toa precision ) will enjoy a @xmath131 improvement in localization .",
    "we note that the best - measured positions of young pulsars have precisions of @xmath30100mas , e.g. j1028@xmath45819 , suggesting that proper motion measurements may be feasible with longer data sets .",
    "we conclude with a case study of the power of robust position measurements .",
    "a prior attempt by @xcite to identify the x - ray counterpart of psr  j1418@xmath46058 , a radio - quiet pulsar embedded in the `` rabbit '' pulsar wind nebula , could not discriminate between two _ chandra _ point sources dubbed `` r1 '' and `` r2 '' @xcite .",
    "although their timing position had sufficient formal statistical precision , its centroid was substantially biased by tn and consistent with neither x - ray source . with appreciably more data and a reliable tn model , we achieve a position uncertainty of @xmath301  and can firmly identify `` r1 '' as the x - ray counterpart ( figure [ fig : rabbit ] ) .",
    "we have presented results of timing a large sample of both radio - quiet and radio - loud @xmath5-ray pulsars with a long span of data .",
    "the strong tn in young pulsars required development of a new method in which a model for the stochastic tn process is fit jointly with the pulsar parameters , allowing characterization of the former and unbiased estimation of the latter . by comparing our best - fit timing positions with precise results from the literature , we demonstrated the efficacy of the method and were able to resolve a longstanding ambiguity in the x - ray counterpart of psr  j1418@xmath46058 .",
