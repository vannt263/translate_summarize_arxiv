    "the prospect of creating quantized vortices in trapped bose - einstein condensed gases ( bec s ) has been an intensely discussed and studied subject in the last few years @xcite . despite the considerable interest in this area of bec studies , many of the most fundamental questions have yet to be answered , such as those concerning the stability and lifetime of such a state @xcite . in this article , we study the properties of a vortex in a trapped bec from a hydrodynamic point of view .",
    "we confine the discussion to two - dimensional systems at zero temperature , and furthermore employ the limit of a condensate which is large in comparison with the size of the vortex .",
    "we will thus only be concerned with a system whose properties can be described by a nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the system that we have in mind is the dilute bose gas , which is governed by the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite at temperatures sufficiently low that the system may be described as a superfluid .",
    "it should , however , be noted that this type of equation is applicable to a wider class of systems than just zero - temperature dilute gases @xcite .",
    "the stability of a vortex in a bec is limited by several factors . at finite temperatures",
    ", the vortex may be destroyed due to collisions with thermal excitations .",
    "@xcite this will not be the subject of this study .",
    "second , the vortex may decay spontaneously even at zero temperature through the excitation of modes ( or , equivalently , the emission of phonons ) in the cloud @xcite .",
    "third , deviations from spherical symmetry in the trapping potential will also limit the lifetime of the vortex .",
    "the two latter processes will be the subject of this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sections [ lagrangesec]-[lifetimesec ] are concerned with the motion of an off - center vortex and its decay through phonon emission . in section [ lagrangesec ]",
    "we introduce the model and the trial assumptions for the density and velocity distributions , and analyze the motion of an off - center vortex . in sec .",
    "[ radiationsec ] , the parallel case of a precessing vortex in an infinite , homogeneous system is analyzed , and the power loss due to the radiation of sound is calculated .",
    "this can be thought of as a `` semiclassical '' approximation to the trapped case considered here . in sec .",
    "[ lifetimesec ] , the validity of this approximation is discussed and a lower bound for the lifetime of a vortex is arrived at . in sec .  [ lsec ] , we find the characteristic time for destruction of a vortex due to deviations from cylindrical symmetry in the trapping potential , and finally , in section [ conclusionsec ] , the results are summarized and discussed .",
    "in the case of a harmonic trapping potential , the equation for the condensate wave function @xmath0 , whose squared modulus gives the superfluid density distribution @xmath1 , reads @xmath2\\psi(\\vec{r } ) = \\mu \\psi(\\vec{r } ) , \\label{gp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the chemical potential and @xmath4 is the effective interaction potential , with @xmath5 being the @xmath6-wave scattering length . assuming the kinetic energy to be negligible",

    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath13 the thomas - fermi approximation is a valid one when @xmath14 is large , and in that limit we have for a two - dimensional system @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the oscillator length .",
    "we now turn to the problem of a cloud containing a singly quantized vortex at the position @xmath17 . in the limit of large @xmath14",
    ", the density distribution of the cloud will not be appreciably affected by the presence of a vortex , except in a region whose size is comparable to the healing length @xmath18 , defined as @xmath19 the healing length gives the length scale over which the wave function for a vortex in a homogeneous bose gas increases from zero to its bulk value @xcite .",
    "for an untrapped system , the density @xmath20 is the value of the density far from the vortex core . in the case of a trapped system",
    ", @xmath20 must be taken to be the local thomas - fermi density at the point @xmath17 in the absence of a vortex , @xmath21 , thus defining a local healing length @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the value of the healing length in the center .",
    "the velocity distribution in a bose - condensed system is given by @xmath24 times the gradient of the phase of the wave function .",
    "for a positively oriented vortex in an infinite , uniform system , it is known to be @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the polar angle relative to the position of the vortex , which gives @xmath27 @xmath28 being the unit vector in the @xmath29 direction .",
    "the velocity field is altered due to the boundary of the system and due to the spatially varying density .",
    "the existence of a boundary requires that the normal velocity vanishes there , and for homogeneous systems the recipe is to introduce a negatively oriented image vortex at the point @xmath30 , giving the velocity field is small , while @xmath31 is nonnegligible , which justifies the neglect of the first term in the equation for stationary flow , @xmath32 .",
    "hence the radial velocity has to ( approximately ) vanish at @xmath33 . ]",
    "@xmath34 if the system has a density gradient , as in the present case , the condition for stationary flow , @xmath35 , is not automatically fulfilled .",
    "writing the velocity field as @xmath36 with @xmath37 taken from eq .",
    "( [ velocity0 ] ) , we get an equation for the correction @xmath38 : @xmath39 since the divergence of @xmath37 vanishes .",
    "an approximate solution to this equation , valid close to the center of the system , may be found by treating @xmath40 as small , whereupon @xmath38 can also be expected to be a small correction , and the third term on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ veleq1 ] ) can be discarded .",
    "we then have @xmath41 where @xmath42 with the boundary condition that the normal velocity vanish for @xmath33 .",
    "since we consider a bose condensate , the velocity has to be a potential flow , @xmath43 , and we have the equation for @xmath44 , @xmath45 whose solution is written in terms of the green s function for the neumann problem on a disk of radius @xmath46 @xmath47 as @xmath48 one can easily obtain higher - order velocity terms in @xmath49 , if one writes @xmath50 one immediately finds that @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 . when the density varies over a scale larger than the healing length , higher order corrections are small",
    ". we will be content in this paper to retain only the zeroth - order term .",
    "the energy per unit length of a two - dimensional system described by a nonlinear schrdinger equation is @xmath54 = \\int d^2\\vec{r } \\left (       \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\left|\\nabla\\psi\\right|^2      + \\frac12 m \\omega_t^2 r^2 \\left|\\psi\\right|^2      + \\frac{u_0}{2 } \\left|\\psi\\right|^4    \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have made explicit the dependence of @xmath55 on the vortex coordinate @xmath17 .",
    "the change in energy of the system due to the presence of a vortex only shows up in the kinetic - energy term , as long as its effect on the density profile is neglected .",
    "we shall denote this additional energy by @xmath56 , since one may regard it as an effective potential for the vortex , depending on the vortex position @xmath17 . in terms of the velocity field",
    "@xmath57 it is written @xmath58 using the lowest - order approximation @xmath37 for the velocity , and employing the thomas - fermi wave function ( [ tfwf ] ) , the result is ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath59 .",
    "\\label{ueff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to obtain this result , one needs to exclude the vortex core , of size @xmath60 around the vortex position , from the radial integral for the integrals to converge .",
    "the first term dominates for small @xmath61 and is independent of the details of the model .",
    "the above analysis shows that as long as the system is not subjected to an external rotational constraint , the vortex will experience an effective potential which decreases with the distance from the trap center , except in a small region close to the boundary , where @xmath56 has a local minimum due to the unphysical behaviour of the thomas - fermi wave function at @xmath33 .",
    "this minimum is located a distance @xmath62 from the edge , given by @xmath63 it is interesting to note that the healing length does not set the length scale here .",
    "apart from constants of order unity , this `` boundary thickness '' is the same as the cut - off length @xmath62 of ref .",
    "@xcite , which comes about when computing the kinetic energy of a thomas - fermi cloud .",
    "we now turn to the motion of the vortex in this simple model .",
    "we assume that the vortex coordinate @xmath17 may have a time dependence , but that all other parameters of the system remain stationary . solving the time - dependent counterpart to the equation ( [ gp ] )",
    "is equivalent to minimizing the action obtained from the lagrangian @xcite @xmath64 = t[\\psi,{\\vec{r}_0},\\dot{{\\vec{r}_0 } } ] - e[\\psi,{\\vec{r}_0}],\\ ] ] where the kinetic term @xmath65 = \\int d^2\\vec{r}\\ ,    \\frac{i\\hbar}{2 } \\left [ \\psi^ * \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t }    - \\psi \\frac{\\partial \\psi^*}{\\partial t}\\right].\\ ] ] a straightforward calculation , remembering that the gradient of the phase of @xmath66 is the velocity field , yields @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of particles per unit length inside the circle of radius @xmath61 . the euler - lagrange equation for @xmath17 and @xmath69 will finally yield , for the radial ( @xmath61 ) and azimuthal ( @xmath70 )",

    "we see that in this model , an off - center vortex executes an orbiting motion around the center with an angular frequency @xmath73 .",

    "nevertheless , the above treatment allows a smooth generalization to incorporate the phonon effect .",
    "we now turn to the problem of a vortex in an infinite system , exercising ( e.  g.  under the influence of an external force ) circular motion .",
    "it has previously been shown @xcite how any homogeneous superfluid described by a nonlinear schrdinger - type energy functional is equivalent to ( 2 + 1)-dimensional electrodynamics , with vortices playing the role of charges and sound corresponding to electromagnetic radiation . for a fluid , which in the absence of vortices has the density @xmath80 ( note that the use of this symbol is not the same as in the preceding section ) , with the local fluid velocity @xmath81 and density @xmath82 , and ( possibly ) containing a vortex at the position @xmath83 , moving at a velocity @xmath84",
    ", we define the `` vortex charge '' @xmath85 , `` vortex density '' @xmath86 , and the corresponding `` vortex current '' @xmath87 .",
    "the speed of sound is @xmath88 .",
    "we then have the analogous maxwell equations : @xmath89 where we have defined @xmath90 the `` no magnetic monopole '' law is clear from the definition of @xmath91 ; the coulomb law states how the presence of vortices create a rotational current , the faraday law is equivalent to the continuity equation for the fluid , and the counterpart to ampre s law derives from the josephson - anderson relation implied by the euler equation .",
    "the energy of the system is @xmath92 and correspondingly the poynting vector @xmath93    electromagnetic potentials , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , are defined in the usual way , and within a lorentz gauge we recover the usual wave equations @xmath96 which have the exact solution in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions @xcite @xmath97 the step functions @xmath98 in the numerator is a feature peculiar to two dimensions ; the corresponding three - dimensional expressions contain a delta function .",
    "we wish to use the above formulation of vortex dynamics in order to find the energy dissipated from a circularly moving vortex due to the radiation of sound waves .",
    "our aim is therefore to find the value of the poynting vector @xmath99 at large distances from the vortex .",

    "in sec .  [ lagrangesec ] we found that an off - center vortex performs a circular motion . in the preceding section",
    "we saw how , in an infinite and homogeneous system , such motion excites sound waves , which carry away energy from the vortex . in a trapped cloud , the effect of such radiation would be that the vortex move outward towards regions of lower potential energy @xmath118 , until it finally escapes from the cloud @xcite .",
    "the application of the results of sec .  [ radiationsec ] on the trapped case may be thought of as a semiclassical approximation .",
    "one condition for this approximation to hold is that the precession frequency of the vortex match the attainable excitation frequencies of the cloud , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ asymptoticb ] ) , where the moving vortex excites sound waves which have the same frequency as the precession .",
    "this requirement , however , is not met in the present case . in a harmonically trapped cloud containing a vortex ,",
    "all but one of the mode frequencies are greater than or equal to the trap frequency @xmath119 @xcite ; the single low - lying mode is identical to an off - center displacement of the vortex @xcite .    comparing the precession frequency with the trap frequency , we find , using eq .",
    "( [ tfquantities ] ) , @xmath120 which is always less than one , except very close to the boundary .",
    "we conclude that the semiclassical approximation is never valid for a vortex in a harmonically trapped cloud .",
    "this does not , however , necessarily imply that the vortex is stable ; only that its lifetime is longer than that implied by the semiclassical approximation .",
    "the results of the two preceding sections can therefore be utilized to calculate a lower bound for the vortex lifetime .",
    "the power dissipated from the vortex by phonon emission , eq .",
    "( [ power ] ) , is to be set equal to the rate of motion downhill the potential gradient : @xmath121 we note that @xmath122 and @xmath76 are functions of @xmath61 . rearranging terms",
    ", we obtain the time @xmath123 for the vortex to move from @xmath124 to @xmath125 : @xmath126 this quantity is a lower bound for the lifetime of a vortex originally residing at a distance @xmath18 from the trap center .",
    "the upper cutoff , @xmath127 , is needed in order to avoid unphysical boundary effects , as discussed in connection with eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) .",
    "the subscript @xmath128 is introduced to indicate that this time scale is associated with the radiation of phonons .",
    "inserting eqs .",
    "( [ frequency ] ) , ( [ f ] ) and ( [ power ] ) into ( [ tau ] ) we get @xmath129 where the dimensionless integral @xmath130 equals @xmath131 with @xmath132 given by eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) . an exact result for the integral i",
    "is easily obtained numerically ; the result is shown in fig . 1 , and will be discussed shortly .",
    "an estimate can be obtained by noting that the function @xmath132 for strong coupling is approximately equal to @xmath133 over a large range of values of @xmath108 , and that the lowest - order term in @xmath108 dominates the numerator , whereupon one gets @xmath134 and @xmath135 finally , we insert the thomas - fermi results ( [ tfquantities ] ) , to cast the above result in terms of the parameter @xmath14 : @xmath136    lower - bound estimates for the lifetime of the vortex , multiplied by the trap frequency @xmath119 .",
    "the solid line shows the time scale @xmath123 connected with phonon radiation , integrated numerically , while the dashed line is the quantity @xmath137 connected with broken rotational symmetry , with the parameter @xmath138 set to 0.001 .",
    "the other factor which at zero temperature may limit the lifetime of a vortex is deviations from rotational symmetry of the trapping potential .",
    "even very small irregularities in the magnetic or electric fields used to trap the condensed gases in experiments may affect the possibility to keep a vortex in the system .",
    "we therefore consider a bec in a somewhat deformed trap . the total torque due to inhomogeneities in the density and the trap is @xmath139 where @xmath1 and @xmath140 are the actual ( not exactly cylindrically symmetric ) density and external potential , respectively . a natural unit for measuring",
    "the torque would be the potential energy associated with the trapping potential , which has the same units : @xmath141 whose value for a harmonic - oscillator trap and a thomas - fermi density profile equals @xmath142 writing @xmath143 we can use @xmath144 as a ( approximately independent of coupling strength ) measure of the relative distortion of the trap and the density profile . assuming @xmath144 to be approximately constant over time , the time scale for the destruction of an initially centrally placed vortex is @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the value of the angular momentum for a system with a central vortex ; this is equal to @xmath147 times the number of particles @xmath12 per unit length ; and so the time for the vortex to move out is @xmath148",
    "we have arrived at two estimates for vortex lifetime : one connected with phonon radiation , and one due to broken rotational symmetry .",
    "the former , @xmath123 , is an increasing function of coupling strength @xmath14 , whereas the latter , @xmath137 , decreases with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "this leaves us with a `` window '' at moderate values of coupling strength , where both time scales are reasonably large .",
    "the lower - bound time scales @xmath123 and @xmath137 are plotted as functions of coupling strength in fig .  1 .",
    "both are to be considered as lower bounds , since the assumptions applied in deriving them are very pessimistic .",
    "the parameter @xmath144 is taken to be @xmath149 , which is an upper bound for the trap deformations attainable experimentally @xcite .",
    "trap frequencies are often around 100 s@xmath150 in experiments ; thus @xmath123 will be longer than one second ( wich is a typical order of magnitude for condensate lifetimes ) as long as @xmath14 is greater than unity , and @xmath137 is longer than one second for all @xmath151 .",
    "this leaves us with a large parameter range , easily attainable experimentally , for which a vortex at zero temperature can be considered as long - lived ; considering the conservative assumptions made here , the actual region of vortex stability is probably much larger than this analysis indicates .",
