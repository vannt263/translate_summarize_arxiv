    "we note that absorption in this component is weak or absent in all other lines and its detection is very sensitive to the fit to the intrinsic emission .",
    "additionally , galactic  @xmath261032 absorption may contribute to the observed ly@xmath4 feature ( this will be addressed further in a study of the galactic absorption by mathur et al .  [ in preparation ] ) .",
    "given these uncertainties , we consider component  4 to be a tentative detection of intrinsic absorption .",
    "interstellar absorption lines and detector artifacts are also identified on the top of each spectrum in figure 1 .",
    "the local interstellar absorption includes three kinematic components , at 0 , + 60 , and + 240 km  s@xmath2 with respect to the galactic rest frame @xcite .",
    "we modeled the intrinsic continuum and emission line fluxes at each absorption feature in the following manner ( \" intrinsic  flux here refers to the agn emission before passing through the absorbers ) .",
    "first , we modeled the intrinsic continuum _ plus _ emission - line flux by fitting a cubic spline to unabsorbed regions of the spectrum on either side of the line .",
    "next , to determine the relative contribution of continuum and line emission at each absorption feature , we estimated the _ continuum _ flux levels at each absorption feature by measuring the flux in regions of the spectrum that are not affected by line emission and linearly interpolating between these regions . due to heavy contamination of the ly@xmath3 and spectral regions by galactic absorption , we used the emission - line profile as a template in fitting the intrinsic emission for these lines .",
    "specifically , we subtracted our fit to the continuum flux from our fit to the total emission spectrum to derive its emission - line profile .",
    "we then scaled this profile in flux , preserving its velocity , and added it to the continuum flux for ly@xmath3 and to derive the fit to these lines .",
    "we find that the line template does not fit the emission profile fully ; an additional , narrow emission component is required .",
    "we modeled this with a fwhm  @xmath30  350  km  s@xmath2 gaussian profile centered at the systemic velocity of ngc  3783 .",
    "since this narrow line region component does not appear in the emission - line profiles in the stis spectrum , it likely arises in an extended region that is not fully covered by the 0@xmath252  @xmath13  0@xmath252 stis aperture .",
    "the broad line region ( blr ) emission from ly@xmath4 and higher order lyman lines is negligible in the _ fuse _ spectrum .",
    "we have generated comparison models using the photoionization code cloudy @xcite for typical conditions in blr gas and find this is consistent with the predicted spectrum .",
    "multiple absorptions of the higher order lyman line photons followed by cascade produce an spectrum dominated by ly@xmath3 .",
    "thus , the line emission that is absorbed by ly@xmath4 is high velocity blr emission .",
    "our fits to the total ( dashed line ) and continuum ( dot - dashed line ) fluxes are plotted on the spectra in figure  1 .",
    "we have modeled the galactic h@xmath28 and absorption , using the parameters derived in @xcite for the high velocity cloud component .",

    ", we show the spectra of ly@xmath4 and illustrating the kinematic link betweeen the uv and x - ray absorption .",
    "the profile is a combination of the four strongest lines from that ion in the mean _ chandra _ spectrum ( see figure  10 in paper  i ) .",
    "the velocities of the four intrinsic uv absorption components are marked with tick marks above the spectra .",
    "structure in the x - ray absorption profiles is revealed in the high s / n mean _ chandra _ spectrum . in figure  2 , at least two kinematic components are apparent in the profile , coinciding with uv components  1 and 2 + 3 ( see discussion in  3.5 of paper  i ) .",
    "we can not rule out the presence of absorption in component 4 as well .",
    "we normalized all absorption features by dividing the averaged spectrum by our fits to the intrinsic emission ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "the normalized profiles are plotted as a function of radial velocity in figure  3 .",

    "the blue wing of  @xmath261242 component  1 is blended with the red wing of  @xmath261238 component  2 .    in the _ fuse _ spectrum ,",

    "we detect absorption in the lyman lines up to ly@xmath0 in components 13 .",
    "higher order lyman lines may be present , but suffer from severe blending with galactic absorption . additionally , strong galactic absorption contaminates component  1 in ly@xmath31 and component  2 in ly@xmath0 . in the top window of figure  3a , ly@xmath4 is seen to be deeper than ly@xmath3 in components 1 , 3 , and 4 , despite having an optical depth that is six times smaller .",
    "additionally , the depth of ly@xmath0 in components 1 and 3 indicates ly@xmath4 is saturated in these components since @xmath32/@xmath33  11 , but the residual flux levels in the cores of the ly@xmath4 features are non - zero .",
    "these are signatures of a complex absorption geometry in ngc  3783 , which is addressed further in  3.1 .",
    "both  @xmath26989 and @xmath34991 , which arises from the fine - structure level , are strong in component  1 .",
    "the  @xmath26989 component  1 profile shown in figure  3c exhibits a sharp edge in the blue wing and spiked core blueward of the centroid .",
    "these features are not seen in the profiles of any other lines in this component , most notably the @xmath34991 line .",
    "furthermore , there is a strong galactic h@xmath28 line at this wavelength contaminating the absorption .",
    "thus , this spike is likely due to noise in the deep trough of the h@xmath28 + absorption .",

    "weak  @xmath26977 absorption also appears in components 2 and 3 .",
    "there is a weak feature corresponding to the  @xmath261118 line at the velocity of component  1 .",
    "however , we can not confirm the presence of this component in the other line of the doublet ,  @xmath261128 , due to contamination with galactic absorption .",
    "the  @xmath17933,944 resonance doublet is contaminated with galactic interstellar features for all components and can not be measured .",
    "lines of lower ionization , such as and , are not detectable in the spectrum .",
    "the observed absorption depths are determined by a combination of the effective covering factor and the optical depths of the lines .",
    "the absorption must be properly corrected for @xmath24 before an accurate column density can be measured . in general , the different covering factors of the line and continuum sources , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , must be taken into account . following the method of @xcite , we assume the same column of gas obscures the two emission sources , i.e. , @xmath38 . the observed residual flux in any absorption line is then given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the intrinsic line and continuum fluxes , respectively .",
    "dividing equation  1 by @xmath42 gives the expression for normalized flux , @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which represent the relative contributions of line and continuum emission to the total intrinsic flux .",
    "the lyman lines provide a unique study of the covering factor .",
    "they give a set of lines that ( a ) span a large range in optical depth and ( b ) have substantially different relative contributions from continuum and line emission , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . since they arise from the same atomic energy level , their optical depths scale simply by their @xmath48 ratios , where @xmath49 is the oscillator strength and @xmath26 the laboratory wavelength of the lines . in figure",
    "3a , the strong absorption in the cores of components  1 and 3 in ly@xmath0 , and component  2 in ly@xmath31 ( ly@xmath0 is blended with galactic in this component ) indicates both ly@xmath3 and ly@xmath4 are saturated in these components and , therefore , _ their core absorption depths are determined entirely by the covering factor_. since ly@xmath3 and ly@xmath4 are saturated , @xmath50  0 for these two lines and their normalized flux given by equation  2 reduces to a simple function of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we have combined these simplified equations for ly@xmath3 and ly@xmath4 and solved for @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the cores of the absorption , thereby separating the individual covering factors of the line and continuum sources . in these measurements , we averaged over 50  km  s@xmath2 intervals centered on the centroid velocities of the components .",
    "we note that this analysis assumes the @xmath36 of the emission ( which affects the ly@xmath4 absorption profile ) and the ly@xmath3 emission are identical .    in table  3",
    ", we list the normalized residual flux , @xmath51 , and the fractional contribution of continuum emission to the total intrinsic flux , @xmath46 , measured in the core of each available lyman line , along with our derived values for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the 1  @xmath52 uncertainties quoted in table  3 were computed from repeated measurements using different placements of intrinsic continuum and blr flux levels , and include the uncertainty in the residual flux due to noise .",
    "these results show the discrepancies in the apparent absorption strengths seen in figure  3a are due to different covering factors of the line and continuum sources .",
    "for example , in component  1 where the ly@xmath4 absorption is deeper than ly@xmath3 , @xmath53  0.57 and 0.15 for ly@xmath4 and ly@xmath3 , respectively , indicating @xmath54 in this component",
    ".    a closer look at the lyman profiles in figure  3a reveals the absorption in the higher order lines is resolved in the individual kinematic components , and is deep over several resolution elements in the _ fuse _ data .",
    "thus , we extended the above analysis to derive the line and continuum covering factors as a function of radial velocity .",
    "an exact solution to @xmath36 and @xmath37 is obtained at all radial velocities where ly@xmath4 is saturated .",
    "since the optical depths of the lyman lines scale according to their @xmath48 ratios , this can be determined from the strengths of the higher order lyman lines .",
    "in general , @xmath55 , where the @xmath21 in the relation applies if the covering factor is less than unity .",
    "thus , the velocities where @xmath56@xmath57 equals zero within uncertainties gives a conservative estimate of the regions of saturated ly@xmath4 ( x represents @xmath0 for components  1 and 3 and @xmath31 for component  2 ) . for velocities where ly@xmath4 is not saturated , such as in component  4 and in the outer wings of the absorption in components 13 ,",
    "the solution gives only lower limits to @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in figure  4 ,",
    "the derived covering factor profiles are plotted .",
    "velocities with only lower limits on the covering factors are plotted with a dotted line .",
    "figure  4a shows that the continuum covering factor decreases smoothly in the blue wings of components 1 and 3 , at velocities where the covering factor is well determined ( solid line ) .",
    "thus , the decreased absorption observed in these wings in ly@xmath4 ( figure  3a ) is a result of decreasing coverage of the continuum source , and the profile shape traces out the unocculted flux .",
    "the other absorption wings may also exhibit decreased covering factor , however , only lower limits are available at these velocities . as discussed in @xcite , instrumental smearing can introduce an error into computations of the covering factor profiles , particularly in the wings . to test this effect",
    ", we convolved the observed absorption profiles with the line spread function of _ fuse_. we find that the changes in the profiles are indetectable within the noise of the data , and conclude that instrumental smearing has a negligible effect on our results .",
    "the variable covering factor detected in this analysis indicates there is substructure in the individual absorbers and may provide a constraint on physical models of the absorption gas .",
    "this is addressed further in  4 .",
    "one possible source of error associated with our calculations that is not included in the uncertainties quoted in table  3 is if the covering factor of the and ly@xmath3 blrs are not the same .",
    "the intensive _ iue _ monitoring campaign of ngc  3783 showed the ly@xmath3 blr flux variations lagged the continuum variations by 3.6  days , while the blr flux lag was only 1.3  days @xcite , indicating the higher ionization line emission is located closer to the ionizing source .",
    "if the blr is also more compact than ly@xmath3 , then @xmath36 for ly@xmath4 may be greater than ly@xmath3 , leading to an overestimate of the continuum covering factor .",
    "this may explain the discrepancy in figure  4a , where the continuum covering factor derived at velocities just blueward of the centroid in component  1 and in the core of component  4 is greater than unity .",
    "another possible source of error involves the contribution of light from an extended scattering region to the residuals in the absorption features .",
    "if the scattered light profile underneath the absorption has structure , this will affect the covering factor calculations ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "this has consequences in using limits on the size of the emission sources to constrain the size of the absorbers for cases of partial coverage .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that scattered light can explain all of the non - unity covering factors derived from the absorption .",
    "for example , to account for all of the residual flux in the cores of ly@xmath3 in components  1 and 3 would require that 60% and 50% , respectively , of the intrinsic continuum plus blr flux is scattered light .",
    "we conclude that , at least in these cases , the low derived covering factors represent partial line - of - sight coverage of the emission - line source .",
    "thus , large variations occur in @xmath36 between the cores of the different components , with values decreasing for higher blueshifted radial velocities in components 13 .",
    "we note that unobscured nlr emission can not account for the low line covering factors , since the low @xmath36 values occur at high outflow velocities . at",
    "most , the nlr only affects the red - wing of the lowest velocity component .",
    "furthermore , it is difficult to see how the scattered light profile could explain the dramatic variation in the continuum covering factor derived in the blue wings of components  1 and 3 . in the outer velocities of the wings",
    ", the scattered contribution would have to account for 6070% of the total intrinsic flux .",
    "thus , although we can not rule out that the continuum source is fully occulted by the absorber in the cores of all the components , the decreasing covering factor derived in the _ wings _ of components  1 and 3 implies velocity - dependent , partial coverage of the continuum source .      for doublet line absorption , the effective covering factor , which is a combination of the individual line and continuum covering factors , can be derived directly from the residual fluxes in the two lines using their intrinsic optical depth ratio @xcite . however , many of the doublets in ngc  3783 are too heavily contaminated with other absorption to apply this technique . in these cases and for lines not arising from doublets , another measure of @xmath24 is required that accounts for the individual line and continuum covering factors , as highlighted in our analysis of the lyman lines .",
    "this is evident in component  1 , in which @xmath58  0.63 is measured in the core of using the doublet method , but and have only one measurable line .",
    "figure  3 shows the , , and ly@xmath3 absorption depths are all relatively shallow compared to in this component .",
    "our fits to the continuum and line emission reveal they also have a stronger relative contribution of blr emission at the wavelengths of component  1 absorption ( @xmath59  0.74 , 0.82 , and 0.85 for , , and ly@xmath3 , respectively , compared to @xmath59  0.58 for ) . in   3.1 , we found the ly@xmath3 absorption is saturated but it appears weak because of a low covering factor of the blr .",
    "similarly , the shallow absorption observed in and may also be the result of relatively low effective covering factors rather than low column densities .",
    "this was suggested by the photoionization modeling results of @xcite , which showed that substantial columns of and/or should always accompany a large column .",
    "motivated by these results , we used the covering factors for to derive effective covering factors and column densities for all intrinsic absorption lines . following @xcite ,",
    "the effective covering factor is defined in terms of the individual line and continuum covering factors , @xmath60 for each line , we computed @xmath24 as a function of radial velocity from the @xmath37 and @xmath36 profiles derived for and our fits to the intrinsic continuum and line fluxes .",
    "the effective covering factors , averaged over 50  km  s@xmath2 intervals in the cores of the absorption components , are listed in table  4 .",
    "uncertainties were derived by propagating the errors associated with @xmath37 and @xmath36 . for the doublet absorption in which the cores of both lines are uncontaminated with other absorption ,",
    "i.e. , component  1 and components  13 , we also computed the effective covering factors in the cores of the absorption directly using the doublet method as described in @xcite .",
    "these values , and associated uncertainties , are listed in parentheses in table  4 .",
    "these results show the effective covering factor derived for in component  1 is equivalent to that determined for , but is larger than the covering factor by more than a factor of two .",
    "_ this provides the only evidence for a covering factor within an individual kinematic component that is a function of ionization .",
    "_ we note this may indeed be the case since component  1 likely consists of at least two distinct subcomponents , one of which is lower ionization and responsible for all of the absorption ( see * ? ? ?",
    "comparison of the line widths in this component reveals further evidence of substructure . in table  5",
    ", we give the fwhm and centroid velocities measured directly from the normalized absorption profiles for each line in component  1 .",
    "the and @xmath15 lines are significantly narrower than the higher ionization lines , and .",
    "substituting equation  3 into equation  2 gives the familiar expression for normalized flux as a function of the effective covering factor @xcite , @xmath61 the factor @xmath62 in equation  4 is the normalized unocculted flux .",
    "this represents the fraction of the total intrinsic flux that is unobscured by the absorber .",
    "the normalized absorption profiles for , , , and are plotted together with the normalized unocculted flux levels derived from equation  4 ( dashed lines ) for component  1 in figure  5a and components  2 + 3 in figure  5b . in these figures",
    "we have plotted only the least contaminated line for the doublets .",
    "figure  5 illustrates how the apparent absorption is a convolution of covering factor and column density . for lines with large column densities , the normalized flux will approach the unocculted flux level , but",
    "never lie below it ( see equation  4 ) .",
    "other than the detector artifact in  @xmath261038 component  1 ( figure  5a ) , we find no cases where residual fluxes lie below the unocculted flux levels outside the 1  @xmath52 uncertainties .",
    "this supports the validity of using the covering factors .    in figure  5 ,",
    "the absorption depths in several lines closely match the derived unocculted flux levels , indicating possible saturation in these lines . for example",
    ", the residual flux in the  @xmath261038 feature in components  2 and 3 traces the unocculted flux levels over nearly the entire profile .",
    "the  @xmath261032 absorption gives a consistent result in the narrow windows of component  2 that are uncontaminated with galactic absorption ( @xmath63650 and @xmath1450  km  s@xmath2 in figure  3b ) .",
    "additionally , the absorption in the blue wings of  @xmath261238 ,  @xmath261548 , and  @xmath261038 in component  1 appears saturated .",
    "however , the absorption is seen to diverge from the unocculted flux in the red wing of and ( is contaminated with a detector artifact at these velocities ) .",
    "thus , if the covering factor profiles derived for are valid for these lines , the column densities are not uniform across the profile in component  1 , providing further evidence for substructure in this component . given the uncertainties in the covering factor profiles due to the uncertain scattered light profile and the possibility that the covering factors of the and ly@xmath3 blrs are not the same , as described in   3.1 , we can not rule out that this apparent substructure is due to our assumptions about the covering factor profiles .",
    "equation  4 can be rearranged to give the optical depth @xcite , @xmath64 where the subscript indicates the calculation is made at each radial velocity , thereby giving the optical depth profile . the column density at each radial velocity",
    "is then obtained from the optical depth , @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "we measured the total column density for each line by integrating equation  6 over the optical depth profiles calculated from equation  5 ; results are given in table  6 .",
    "for the doublets where a direct measurement of the effective covering factor is available from the residuals in the two lines , we used the core value listed in parenthesis in table  4 to compute the column density .",
    "components 2 and 3 were deblended following the method outlined in @xcite . in saturated regions , we measured lower limits for the column densities using @xmath66 in equation  5 , where @xmath67 is the 1  @xmath52 uncertainty in the normalized flux .",
    "upper limits on undetectable lines were determined from uncertainties in the normalized fluxes .",
    "the 1  @xmath52 uncertainties quoted in table  6 were estimated from repeated measurements , and include uncertainties in our fits to the intrinsic emission as well as the photon noise .",
    "we note that the lower limits on the columns from the combined components are consistent with the upper limit of 10@xmath14  @xmath7 derived from the x - ray spectrum in paper  i. if the absorption in component  1 is real ( see discussion in  2 ) , then it has a column density of 1.5  @xmath19  0.7  @xmath13  10@xmath68  @xmath7 .",
    "given the important implications of our results involving the covering factors , particularly the lower covering factor derived for , it is worthwhile to address the possible systematic errors that were discussed in  3.1 in more depth .",
    "first , we note that any contribution of scattered light to the residual fluxes in the ly@xmath4 or ly@xmath3 absorption will lead to an _ underestimate _ of the covering factors .",
    "this would lead to an even larger discrepancy between the effective covering factor derived for from the doublet and the prediction from the results .",
    "the second possible systematic error is introduced if the sizes of the and ly@xmath3 blrs are not identical , leading to different emission line covering factors for ly@xmath4 and ly@xmath3 .",
    "since the ly@xmath0 absorption has no underlying blr emission ( see table  3 ) , it can be used to place limits on the covering factors that are unaffected by any discrepancy in the sizes of the blrs of the different lines .",
    "for example , in component  1 , an absolute lower limit on the covering factor in the core follows directly from the depth of the feature , @xmath69  1@xmath700.77 .",
    "this is stricly a lower limit , since ( a ) ly@xmath0 is not saturated and ( b ) there may be a contribution from scattered flux . using this result in equation  3",
    ", we derive an absolute lower limit on the effective covering factor predicted for from the covering factors , @xmath71  0.58 . comparing this with the value derived from the doublet , @xmath58  0.30  @xmath190.07",
    ", we conclude that our finding that the covering factor of is less than is robust .",
    "while detailed photoionization modeling of the absorption will be presented in future papers ( kraemer et al .  in preparation",
    "; netzer et al .  in preparation ) , we can place some immediate constraints on the physical conditions and geometry of the low ionization uv absorber in component  1 .",
    "we refer to the photoionization modeling results in @xcite , which predicted a total hydrogen column density , @xmath72  5  @xmath13  10@xmath73  @xmath7 , and ionization parameter , @xmath74  0.0018 , for this subcomponent .",
    "since the column measured in the averaged spectrum is somewhat higher than in the @xcite study , partly due to the lower covering factor found for this line in the present study , and we have a more rigid upper limit on the column because of the high s / n , we have modified the models slightly . using the ionizing spectral energy distribution and abundances employed in the models of @xcite",
    ", we find that @xmath5  10@xmath6  @xmath7 and @xmath8  0.005 are required to match the column and upper limit simultaneously .",
    "the detection of @xmath34117576 absorption , which arises from metastable levels 6.5  ev above the ground state , implies a high density in the low ionization absorber in component  1 @xcite .",
    "the relative population of the metastable levels is determined by the physical conditions in the absorber , and the ratio of metastable to ground state columns can be used to estimate the electron density , @xmath75 @xcite . due to contamination of the  @xmath26977 feature by galactic h@xmath28 , the ground state column density can not be measured directly in ngc  3783 .",
    "instead , we use the photoionization model results , which predict @xmath76  2  @xmath13  10@xmath77  @xmath7 .",
    "the predicted column is not a strong function of the exact @xmath78 , @xmath79 solution needed to match the , since and appear in the same zone due to the similarity in their ionization potentials .",
    "our measured column for the metastable level from @xmath34117576 ( 1.2  @xmath13  10@xmath68  @xmath7 ) then implies the ratio of metastable to ground state columns is @xmath160.006 .",
    "the photoionization models predict @xmath80  20,000  k in the absorber , which is largely insensitive to the exact @xmath79 , @xmath78 solution for our assumed sed . using the calculations in @xcite",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath9  10@xmath10  @xmath11 for the low ionization subcomponent .",
    "this high density implies a very small radial dimension for the absorber , @xmath1610@xmath81  cm for a column of 10@xmath6  @xmath7 , which may indicate the gas is clumpy and has a low volume filling factor ( see discussion below ) . from the density , lower limit on @xmath78 , and estimate of the ionizing continuum luminosity given by @xcite , we derive an upper limit on the location of the absorber with respect to the ionizing continuum source , @xmath12  8  @xmath13  10@xmath14  cm .    the partial coverage of the emission sources revealed in the analysis of the lines in",
    "  3.1 also places constraints on the absorption geometry . at velocities exhibiting partial coverage ,",
    "the area of the absorbing gas projected on the sky is smaller than the projected area of the emission sources .",
    "the monitoring study of ngc  3783 revealed large amplitude variations of both the continuum and blr emission @xcite .",
    "the most rigid constraint comes from the measured lag of the blr flux variations behind the continuum variations .",
    "for example , @xcite found the ly@xmath3 blr flux varied by up to a factor of 1.6 and lagged the continuum variations by 3.6  days . from light travel time arguments , this constrains the projected size of much of the blr to be @xmath163.6  lt - days ( 10@xmath82  cm ) across .",
    "thus , in components  1 and 3 , with @xmath83  0.31 and 0.55 measured in the cores , the projected area of the absorbers is @xmath16(5.5  @xmath13  10@xmath77)@xmath84 and @xmath16(7.5  @xmath13  10@xmath82)@xmath84  cm@xmath84 , respectively .",
    "these results provide important clues to the physical nature of the absorbers .",
    "the smoothly varying covering factor of the continuum detected in the wings of the absorption in  3.1 indicates there is substructure within the individual kinematic components .",
    "one interpretation of this result is that the absorption components are comprised of many small substructures , such as cloudlets or turbulent cells . in this scenario ,",
    "the decreasing coverage in the wings may be a consequence of the velocity dispersion of these substructures , with a decreasing number of  clouds \" having velocities that diverge from the centroid velocity .",
    "since , in general , the ionic column densities do not decrease dramatically in the wings of the absorption profiles ( see figure  5 ) , there can not be much overlap of clouds in the cores of the absorbers , indicating they have small volume filling factors .",
    "the extreme compactness of the gas comprising the low ionization subcomponent in component  1 provides additional evidence for this model .",
    "since the radial thickness of this gas is much smaller than the projected dimensions of the emission sources , the most natural explanation is that a large number of very small , dense clouds combine to give the observed absorption .",
    "the alternative interpretation would require that the absorber is an exceedingly thin sheet of material .",
    "previous studies have invoked absorption by a clumpy gas to explain the complex structure seen in other agn absorption systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a highly inhomogeneous absorbing medium is predicted by the multitemperature wind models of @xcite .",
    "ngc  3783 was observed with _ hst_/stis at 18 epochs and with _ fuse _ at 5 epochs as part of an intensive multiwavelength monitoring campaign designed to investigate the intrinsic absorption in this seyfert  1 galaxy .",
    "we have combined the observations to produce a high s / n averaged spectrum in the uv and far - uv .",
    "the major findings of our study follow .",

    "this is the first detection of metastable in a seyfert galaxy other than ngc  4151 @xcite .",
    "no lower ionization lines appear in absorption , and we place stringent upper limits on their column densities .",
    "a fourth kinematic component of intrinsic absorption is tentatively identified at a radial velocity of @xmath11027  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this component appears strong only in ly@xmath4 , which may be contaminated with galactic absorption , and . in all other lines ,",
    "the detection of this component is very sensitive to the fit to the intrinsic emission .",
    "the lyman lines reveal a complex absorption geometry in ngc  3783 and highlight the importance of determining the individual covering factors of the continuum and emission - line sources .",
    "the strength of the higher order lyman lines indicates ly@xmath3 and ly@xmath4 are saturated in components 13 .",
    "the continuum and emission - line covering factors were separated using the ly@xmath3 and ly@xmath4 absorption in each kinematic component , both in the cores of absorption and as a function of radial velocity .",
    "the covering factor of the blr varies significantly between the cores of the absorption components , with @xmath83  0.33 , 0.84 , 0.55 , and 0.03 derived in components 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "the large residual fluxes measured in ly@xmath3 in components  1 and 3 imply that , at least in these components , the non - unity emission - line covering factors can not be fully accounted for by light from an extended scatterer , and thus represent partial coverage of the blr .",
    "we also find evidence for variation of the continuum covering factor with velocity in the individual kinematic components .",
    "specifically , @xmath37 decreases by @xmath1660% over several resolution elements in the wings of the absorption .",
    "this smoothly decreasing coverage is a signature of substructure within the absorbers .",
    "the individual continuum and line covering factors derived from were used to derive effective covering factors for all lines .",
    "comparison to the covering factors derived directly by the doublet method reveals the covering factor is smaller than that of and by more than a factor of two in component  1 .",
    "this implies substructure in component  1 and is consistent with the prediction by @xcite that this component is comprised of at least two zones of uv absorption .",
    "furthermore , the fwhm of and are narrower than the higher ionization lines in component  1 , providing additional evidence for substructure . employing the covering factor profiles for the higher ionization lines , we find the relatively weak apparent and absorption compared to in component  1 is due to low effective covering factors rather than small column densities .",

    "additionally , is found to be saturated in components  2 and 3 , as well as in the blue wing of component  1 .",
    "we place lower limits on the total hydrogen column density and ionization parameter in the low ionization subcomponent in component  1 , @xmath5  10@xmath6  @xmath7 and @xmath8  0.005 .",
    "combining model predictions of the total column with our measured @xmath15 column gives @xmath9  10@xmath86  @xmath11 .",
