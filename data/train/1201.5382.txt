    "a major goal of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is to test the idea of weak scale supersymmetry ( susy)@xcite , wherein superpartners of the standard model ( sm ) particles have masses of the order of 1  tev .",
    "the susy searches by the atlas and cms collaborations have reported no signal beyond sm expectations  @xcite in @xmath30  fb@xmath15 of data . interpreting their results within the msugra / cmssm model  @xcite , atlas and cms exclude roughly the mass range @xmath31  tev for @xmath32 , and @xmath33  gev in the case where @xmath34 .",
    "tev , giving a gluino mass limit of about @xmath35  gev ; this limit suffers further weakening for decoupling scalars : see @xcite . ]",
    "this reach will soon be extended since each experiment now has @xmath36 fb@xmath15 of data collected .",
    "analysis of this extended data sample is eagerly anticipated by the hep community .    within a large class of susy models",
    ", it is expected that pair production of strongly interacting sparticles@xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 production  constitutes the dominant susy production cross sections@xcite .",
    "the gluinos and squarks are then expected to decay through a ( possibly lengthy ) cascade to lighter sparticles plus sm particles , until the decay chain terminates in the ( stable ) lightest susy particle ( lsp ) @xcite .",
    "the lsp is expected from cosmological arguments to be a massive , neutral , weakly interacting particle ( such as the lightest neutralino @xmath40 ) and so does not deposit energy in the experimental apparatus , giving rise to the classic missing transverse energy ( @xmath13 ) signature .",
    "thus , gluino and squark pair production followed by cascade decays is expected to give rise to final states containing multiple isolated leptons , multiple jets and @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "while weak scale supersymmetric models are theoretically very compelling , they do suffer from a variety of problems , including 1 .  the susy flavor problem , 2 .",
    "the susy @xmath0 problem , 3 .  the gravitino problem , and 4 .",
    "the danger of too rapid proton decay in susy grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "all four of these problems are greatly ameliorated if not solved by the decoupling solution , wherein first and second generation sfermion masses are pushed into the multi - tev regime or even beyond .",
    "naturalness may be maintained in models wherein sparticles that couple directly to the higgs sector ",
    "the third generation scalars and electroweak - inos  remain at or below the tev scale@xcite .",
    "also , in many susy models , it is expected that gaugino mass parameters unify at the gut scale , in parallel with unification of gauge couplings .",
    "renormalization group running effects result in weak scale gaugino masses occurring in the approximate ratio @xmath41 .",
    "we would thus expect the physical gluino @xmath42 , the wino - like chargino @xmath8 and the bino - like neutralino @xmath40 to be found with roughly the same mass ratio , provided the superpotential @xmath43-parameter @xmath44 .",
    "consequently , in models with gaugino mass unification , the experimental bounds on the gluino mass impose severe constraints on chargino and neutralino masses .",
    "current analyses do not put independent constraints on the electroweak - ino masses if the gaugino mass unification condition is dropped @xcite .",
    "moreover , the relative strengths of signals in various multilepton topologies ( as well as the gluino mass reach if the parent - daughter mass difference is sufficiently small ) depend sensitively on the @xmath45 and/or @xmath46 mass differences .",
    "finally , an independent discovery of directly produced charginos and neutralinos is essential to elucidate the supersymmetry origin of any excess in the well - studied multilepton plus multijet plus @xmath13 channel at the lhc .",
    "it is therefore interesting and relevant to find ways to discover charginos and neutralinos independently of gluinos .",
    "another point is important to note : as we push the gluino mass to larger values , convolution of the @xmath37 subprocess cross sections with parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) requires sampling higher and higher values of parton fractional momentum @xmath47 . for such high values of @xmath47",
    ", the parton - parton luminosity is sharply falling . at some point",
    "we expect that , despite being strongly - produced , gluino pair production will no longer dominate over electroweak - ino pair production , since these latter reactions will sample the pdfs at much lower values of @xmath47 if electroweak - inos are significantly lighter than gluinos .    to illustrate this , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsecs ] the @xmath37 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 production cross sections in pb at lhc with @xmath50 collisions at @xmath4 tev .",
    "our results are in nlo qcd from the program prospino@xcite .",
    "we take @xmath51 tev for the first and second generations , in accord with a decoupling solution to the above - mentioned pathologies and , for simplicity , assume universal gaugino masses at the gut scale . from fig .",
    "[ fig : xsecs ] , we see that gluino - pair production is dominant for @xmath52 gev . for higher values of @xmath53 ,",
    "@xmath48 production is dominant , followed by @xmath49 production ( the reaction @xmath54 has lower cross section , and @xmath6 , @xmath55 production occurs via the unsuppressed isotriplet @xmath56 gauge coupling , whereas the @xmath57 coupling is strongly suppressed because it arises only due to the subdominant higgsino content of the wino - like chargino and the bino - like neutralino  the @xmath11-bino - wino coupling is forbidden by gauge invariance .",
    "] as can be seen _",
    "e.g. _   in fig .  12.23 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for lhc with @xmath58 tev ,",
    "@xmath37 production remains dominant up to @xmath59 tev if squarks are very heavy . since atlas and cms already exclude @xmath33 gev when @xmath60 is large it may prove fruitful to probe electroweak gaugino pair production in the 2011 data but most of all in the 2012 lhc run .",
    "this was recognized early on in @xcite and also more recently in in  @xcite . recognizing that the stability of the higgs sector also requires sub - tev top squarks",
    ", we also show the cross section for top squark pair production for @xmath61 by the dotted line .",
    "in other words , for the dotted line , the graph is plotted versus @xmath62 . if other third generation squarks are also light , their pair production cross sections are also given by the dotted line with the understanding that the label on the horizontal axis is the corresponding squark mass . ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsecs ] .",
    "we see that this cross section also drops off rapidly with the top squark mass .",
    "unless top squarks are exceptionally light ( with masses of order @xmath63 or smaller , and certainly much smaller than @xmath53 ) , electroweak - ino production remains the dominant mechanism .",
    "let us next examine the signatures resulting from @xmath55 production . if @xmath64 , the well - known trilepton signal provides a golden signature for chargino - neutralino production@xcite provided only that the branching fraction for neutralino decay is not unduly suppressed@xcite .",
    "the two - body chargino decay @xmath65 is expected to dominate for @xmath66 , while the two - body decay @xmath7 dominates for @xmath67 . for even higher values of @xmath68 ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath69 , the decay mode @xmath70 turns on and dominates .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bfs ] , where we show the @xmath6 branching fractions versus @xmath68 for a msugra model line with @xmath71 tev , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we vary @xmath75 to obtain the variation in @xmath68 . in this case , @xmath76 is kinematically allowed for 175  gev @xmath77  gev , which corresponds to gluino masses in the interval 600  gev  @xmath78  gev .",
    "thus , in this mass range , we expect the single reaction @xmath79 followed by @xmath65 and @xmath7 to be the dominant susy production and decay process at lhc7 for models with full gaugino mass unification .",
    "the endpoints of this interval can shift up or down in non - universal mass scenarios .",
    "we begin by examining the viability of the reaction @xmath81 for susy discovery at lhc7 , focusing on the case where both @xmath82 and @xmath11 decay leptonically , resulting in clean trilepton events .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the trilepton signal from the decay @xmath83 where a pair of opposite - sign same - flavor ( os / sf ) dileptons reconstruct the @xmath82 mass has generally been regarded as unobservable because of large sm background from @xmath19 production .",
    "the case where the @xmath11 decays hadronically will be discussed in section  [ sec : lljj ] .    for our lhc7 event generation",
    ", we use the event generator isajet 7.79@xcite for signal reactions , while for the simulation of the background events , we use alpgen@xcite and madgraph@xcite to compute the hard scattering events and pythia @xcite for the subsequent showering and hadronization . in our simulation , we include the following backgrounds for the @xmath84 signal : @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 . for @xmath85 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98",
    "we include the full matrix elements for at least two real parton emissions and use the mlm matching algorithm to avoid double counting . for @xmath19 production",
    "we include the full matrix elements for the @xmath99 process @xmath100 .",
    "k - factors for both signal and background ( bg ) are included and are computed using prospino@xcite and mcfm@xcite , respectively .    in our calculations , we employ a toy detector simulation with calorimeter cell size @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the hcal ( hadronic calorimetry ) energy resolution is taken to be @xmath103 for @xmath104 and fcal ( forward calorimetry ) is @xmath105 for @xmath106 , where the two terms are combined in quadrature .",
    "the ecal ( electromagnetic calorimetry ) energy resolution is assumed to be @xmath107 . in all these , @xmath108 is the energy in gev units .",
    "we use the cone - type isajet @xcite jet - finding algorithm to group the hadronic final states into jets .",
    "jets and isolated lepton are defined as follows :    jets are hadronic clusters with @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 gev .    electrons and muons are considered isolated if they have @xmath112 , @xmath113 gev with visible activity within a cone of @xmath114 about the lepton direction , @xmath115 $ ] gev .",
    "we identify hadronic clusters as @xmath116-jets if they contain a @xmath117 hadron with @xmath118 15 gev , @xmath119 3.0 and @xmath120 0.5 .",
    "we assume a tagging efficiency of 60@xmath121 and light quark and gluon jets can be mis - tagged as a @xmath116-jet with a probability 1/150 for @xmath122 100 gev , 1/50 for @xmath123 250 gev , with a linear interpolation for 100 gev @xmath124 250 gev .",
    "next , we invoke the following pre - selection cuts on our signal and background event samples to extract those with a @xmath125 topology :    *   * @xmath126 ( to aid in vetoing @xmath85 background ) , * 3 isolated leptons with @xmath127 gev and * @xmath128  gev ,    where two of the leptons in the event must form an os / sf pair .",
    "if more than one os / sf pairing is possible , the pair which minimizes @xmath129 is chosen .",
    "the remaining lepton is labeled @xmath130 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : met ] we show the @xmath13 and transverse mass ( @xmath131 ) distributions for the signal and the sm bg after the pre - selection cuts have been applied .",
    "the signal point has @xmath132  gev , @xmath133  gev and @xmath134  gev and we only consider @xmath55 production . due to its relatively light parent mass scale , the signal presents a soft @xmath13 spectrum , barely visible above the sm background .",
    "this is in strong contrast with events from production of the much heavier gluinos or squarks , where the cascade decays to the lsp result in a usually much harder @xmath13 spectrum .",
    "therefore , the usual @xmath13 plus jets / leptons searches ( optimized to look for strongly produced gluinos and squarks ) are insensitive to the @xmath135 signal .    as seen in the upper frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : met ] , after the pre - selection cuts the bg is dominated by @xmath88 production at low @xmath13 and by @xmath19 production for @xmath136  gev .",
    "the transverse mass @xmath137 from @xmath138 , shown in the lower frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : met ] , falls sharply beyond the expected jacobian peak at @xmath139 . in constrast ,",
    "the corresponding signal distribution from @xmath55 production extends to considerably larger values due to the presence of the two neutralinos in the final state .",
    "therefore , a @xmath140 cut is extremely efficient to suppress the @xmath19 background .",
    "this is seen in the lower frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : met ] , where the signal distribution clearly stands out for @xmath141  gev .",
    "however , since a precise prediction for the @xmath142 tail from @xmath19 events requires a full detector simulation or data - driven estimates , we define a conservative signal region requiring :    * @xmath143 gev , * @xmath144 gev .",
    "the bg cross sections from the dominant sm processes after each of the cuts mentioned above , together with the corresponding cross sections for the representative signal point with @xmath132  gev , @xmath145  gev and @xmath134  gev , are shown in table [ tab : xsecs ] .",
    "we stress that the signal shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : met ] and listed in table  [ tab : xsecs ] comes exclusively from @xmath55 production .",
    "depending on the sparticle spectrum , the actual signal may be larger if heavier electroweak - inos are also accessible , or if gluino and/or squark pair production followed by their cascade decays to the @xmath19 final state is sizeable .",
    "nonetheless , a trilepton signal would be visible with an integrated luminosity of @xmath146  fb@xmath15 at lhc7 even if light electroweak - inos are the _ only _ susy particles being produced .",
    ".number of events generated , total cross section and cross section after cuts for the dominant backgrounds in the trilepton channel and for the signal .",
    "all cross sections are in fb and the signal is from just @xmath55 production with @xmath147  gev , @xmath148  gev and @xmath134  gev .",
    "the total bg values include all processes listed in the text , including the subdominant ones not shown in the table .",
    "[ tab : xsecs ] [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : mll ] , we show the @xmath149 distribution for signal and background after all the above cuts have been applied .",
    "the dominant backgrounds displayed are @xmath85 and @xmath95 ( including @xmath150 ) . due to the @xmath13 cut",
    ", the remaining @xmath95 contribution comes mostly from @xmath150 , with @xmath151s decaying leptonically .",
    "therefore all @xmath95 events have @xmath152 .",
    "for these dominant backgrounds @xmath85 , @xmath150 etc. we expect nearly equal contributions of opposite - flavor dileptons ( of ) : @xmath153 pairs , while signal is all in the sf dilepton channel .",
    "hence the of distribution can serve as a background normalization . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mll ] , the signal is visible over the @xmath85 distribution at @xmath154 .",
    "width smearing in the real @xmath82 emission , so all @xmath155 fall exactly at @xmath156 . ]",
    "therefore , after applying the cuts listed above , we also require :    @xmath128  gev .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : xsecs2 ] , after the @xmath149 cut has been included , the bg is almost entirely given by @xmath85 , which contribution can be estimated using the opposite - flavor dilepton invariant mass , as mentioned above . however , although the dilepton signal rate is considerably superior to the trilepton case , the signal still is significantly below the background . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig-2l ] we plot the signal significance after the above cuts have been applied for various integrated luminosity values versus @xmath63 . as in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig-3l ] we assume a msugra line with @xmath71 tev , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . we see immediately that the significance in the dilepton channel is almost half of the significance in the trilepton channel , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig-3l ] .",
    "nevertheless , corroborative evidence at the @xmath157 level is expected over almost the entire kinematically allowed range for an integrated luminosity of 20 - 30  fb@xmath15 .",
    "in this paper , we have pointed out that for a class of susy models with decoupled matter scalars , @xmath158 and gluino masses above @xmath159500 gev , electroweak production of @xmath55 dominates the susy production rate at lhc7 .",
    "we have examined the case where @xmath160 , for which we expect the two - body decay modes @xmath161 and @xmath65 to dominate , leading to rather simple final state topologies including @xmath162 ( trileptons ) and @xmath163 ( dilepton plus jets ) .",
    "evaluation of the trilepton signal against sm backgrounds shows that the susy signal should be observable with a @xmath164 significance at lhc7 up to @xmath165 gev ( depending on @xmath16 ) , for an integrated luminosity of 30  fb@xmath15 . in models with gaugino mass unification",
    ", this corresponds to a range in gluino masses of @xmath166 gev .",
    "moreover , we find that for most of this region a @xmath167 excess is expected in the 5 fb@xmath15 data sample that has already been accumulated . assuming 30  fb@xmath15 of integrated luminosity at lhc7",
    ", the trilepton channel will be competitive in reach with the canonical multijet plus @xmath13 search in models with unified gaugino mass parameters .",
    "if a signal is seen in the trilepton channel , a @xmath168 confirmatory signal is also expected in the dilepton plus jets channel for most of the parameter space , thus making a stronger case for the @xmath135 signal .",
    "most importantly , the simultaneous presence of these signals will point to the susy origin of any new physics that might be discovered in the 2012 run .",
