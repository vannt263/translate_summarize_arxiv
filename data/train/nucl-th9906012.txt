    "the purpose of this paper is to derive the light - front formalism necessary to compute the properties of finite nuclei .",
    "nuclear properties are very well handled within the existing conventional nuclear theory , so it behooves us to explain why we are embarking on this project .",
    "our motivation is that understanding experiments involving high energy nuclear reactions seems to require that light - front dynamics and light cone variables be used .",
    "consider the emc experiment @xcite , which showed that there is a significant difference between the parton distributions of free nucleons and nucleons in a nucleus .",
    "this difference can interpreted as a shift in the momentum distribution of valence quarks towards smaller values of the bjorken variable @xmath8 .",
    "the bjorken variable is a ratio of the plus - momentum @xmath9 of a quark to that of the target .",
    "thus light cone variables are relevant .",
    "if one uses @xmath10 as a momentum variable the corresponding canonical spatial variable is @xmath11 and the time variable is @xmath12 .",
    "it is important to realize that the use of light - front dynamics is not limited to quarks within the nucleon  it also applies to nucleons within the nucleus .",
    "this formalism is useful whenever the momentum of initial or final state nucleons is large compared to their mass @xcite . in particular , it can be used for @xmath13 and @xmath14 reactions .",
    "if one uses light - front variables for nucleons in a nucleus , it is also necessary to maintain consistency with the information derived previously using conventional nuclear dynamics .",
    "this provides the technical challenge which we address in the present manuscript .",
    "the conventional equal - time approach to nuclear structure physics provides an excellent framework , so it is worthwhile to introduce the light - front variables and describe the expected advantages in a general way .",
    "the use of the light - cone variables can be obtained using a simple argument based on kinematics @xcite .",
    "suppose the virtual photon that is absorbed by a fermion at a space - time point ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) .",
    "the fermion then starts to move at high momentum and nearly the speed of light and emits the photon at another space time point ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) . in between the two times , the wave function of the entire system has undergone a time evolution given by the complicated operator @xmath19 .",
    "but we have @xmath20 , if the @xmath21axis is opposite to the direction of the virtual photon .",
    "the two scattering events occur at different times , but at the same value of @xmath22 . thus if we use @xmath23 as a time variable , no time evolution factor appears .",
    "the net result is that the cross section involves light - like correlation functions which involve field operators evaluated at the same light - front time : @xmath24 ( see for example the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "thus it is a specific and general feature of the light - front wave approach that knowing only the ground state wave function is sufficient for computing the distribution functions .",
    "let us review the salient features of the basic idea that using the light - front approach leads to a simplified treatment . to be specific , consider high energy electron scattering from nucleons in nuclei .",
    "the key ingredient in the light - front simplification is to realize the main difference between the two formalisms . in the equal - time formalism , sums over intermediate states are taken over eigenstates of the hamiltonian , @xmath25 .",
    "the usual three momentum is conserved , but energy is not conserved in intermediate states . in the light - front approach",
    "one sums over eigenstates of the minus component of the total momentum operator .",
    "the value of @xmath1 is not conserved in intermediate state sums , and the values of @xmath0 and @xmath26 are conserved .",
    "this is especially convenient for high energy reactions , in which the plus - component is the largest component of the momentum for each projectile or ejectile",
    ".    the advantage of using @xmath1 as an `` energy '' variable can be easily described .",
    "let the four - momentum @xmath27 of the exchanged virtual photon be given by @xmath28 , with @xmath29 , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are both very large but @xmath32 is finite ( the bjorken limit ) . in this case it is worthwhile to use the light - cone variables @xmath33 in which @xmath34 , @xmath35 , so that @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath37 is the mass of a nucleon and @xmath38 is the bjorken variable .",
    "we shall neglect @xmath39 in comparison to @xmath40 , noting that corrections to this can be handled in a systematic fashion .",
    "then the schematic form of the scattering cross section for @xmath41 , where @xmath42 represents the final nuclear eigenstate of @xmath1 , and @xmath43 the four - momentum of the final proton , is given by @xmath44 here the operator @xmath45 is a schematic representation of the electromagnetic current . performing the four - dimensional integral over @xmath43 leads to the expression @xmath46 the argument of the delta function @xmath47 .",
    "thus we see that @xmath48 does not appear in the argument of the delta function , or anywhere else , so that we can replace the sum over intermediate states by unity . in the usual equal - time representation ,",
    "one finds the argument of the delta function to be @xmath49 .",
    "the energy of the final state appears , and one can not do the sum .    to proceed further in this schematic approach",
    "we take @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a nucleon destruction operator and @xmath52 .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath53 because @xmath54 as demanded by the delta function",
    ". then one can re - express eq .",

    "integration in eq .",
    "( [ ds2 ] ) leads to @xmath58 with @xmath59 as the probability for a nucleon in the ground state to have a plus momentum of @xmath60 .    the quantity @xmath59 has been a widely used prescription up for handling the light - front in a simple way .",
    "the variable @xmath60 is replaced by @xmath61 , in which the label @xmath62 denotes a shell - model orbital @xmath63 of binding energy @xmath64",
    ". then @xmath65 in which @xmath66 is an occupation probability .",
    "the validity of this prescription , which rests on a reasonable assumption , is rather suspect because the variable @xmath67 is a kinematic variable , unrelated to discrete eigenvalues of a wave equation .",
    "one of the main purposes of the present paper is to see if anything like this prescription emerges from our calculations .",
    "we shall see that eq .",
    "( [ up ] ) is not obtained , if a vector potential is a significant part of the nuclear mean field .",
    "it is useful to discuss the relation with @xmath68-scaling @xcite .",
    "the arguments that the cross section depends on a plus - momentum distribution are well known when used for quarks in a nucleon , but they also apply to nucleons in a nucleus @xcite .",
    "ji and filippone @xcite showed that the @xmath68 scaling function @xmath69 extracted in quasi - elastic electron scattering on nuclei is actually the light cone plus - momentum distribution function for nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "it is useful to use a relativistic form of the variable @xmath68 @xcite in which @xmath70 as both @xmath71 and @xmath72 are large in magnitude , and @xmath73 is the single nucleon separation energy .",
    "but @xmath74 , so that @xmath75 here @xmath76 is a new y - scaling variable .",
    "this means that according to eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) @xmath77 so that a measurement of @xmath78 determines the probability that the struck nucleon has a plus - momentum of @xmath79 .",
    "this probability also enters in convolution model calculations of nuclear deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the use of light - front dynamics to compute nuclear wave functions should allow us to compute @xmath69 from first principles .",
    "furthermore , we claim that using light - front dynamics incorporates the experimentally relevant kinematics from the beginning , and therefore is the most efficient way to compute the cross sections for nuclear deep inelastic scattering and nuclear quasi - elastic scattering .",
    "it is worthwhile to review some of the features of the emc effect @xcite .",
    "the key experimental result is the suppression of the structure function for @xmath80 .",
    "this means that the valence quarks of bound nucleons carry less plus - momentum than those of free nucleons .",
    "one way to understand this result is to postulate that mesons carry a larger fraction of the plus - momentum in the nucleus than in free space .",
    "while such a model explains the shift in the valence distribution , one obtains at the same time a meson ( i.e. anti - quark ) distribution in the nucleus , which is strongly enhanced compared to free nucleons and which should be observable in drell - yan experiments @xcite .",
    "however , no such enhancement has been observed experimentally @xcite , and the implications are analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the use of light - front dynamics allows us to compute the necessary nuclear meson distribution functions using variables which are experimentally relevant .",
    "the need for a computation of such functions in a manner consistent with generally known properties of nuclei led one of us to attempt to construct a light front treatment of nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "these calculations , using a lagrangian in which dirac nucleons are coupled to massive scalar and vector mesons @xcite , treated the example of infinite nuclear matter within the mean field approximation . in this case , the meson fields are constants in both space and time and the momentum distribution has support only at @xmath81 .",
    "such a distribution would not be accessible experimentally , so that the suppression of the plus - momentum of valence quarks would not imply the existence of a corresponding testable enhancement of anti - quarks .",
    "however , it is necessary to ask if the result is only a artifact of the infinite nuclear size and of the mean field approximation .",
    "the present paper is an attempt to handle finite - sized nuclei using light - front dynamics .",
    "it is worthwhile to discuss , in a general way , how it is that we are able to find spectra which have the correct number of degenerate states .",
    "let us imagine that we try to determine eigenstates of a lf hamiltonian by means of a variational calculation .",
    "simply minimizing the lf energy obviously leads to nonsensical results since the lf energy scales like the inverse of the lf momentum .",
    "even if one has only a poor ansatz for the intrinsic wave function , one can easily reach zero energy by letting the overall momentum scale to infinity !",
    "however , this problem is avoided by performing a constrained variation , in which the total lf momentum is fixed by including a lagrange multiplier term proportional to the total momentum in the lf hamiltonian .",
    "note that this is not a problem if one is able to use a fock space basis in which the total plus and @xmath82 momentum of each component are fixed . in calculations involving many particles",
    ", the fock state approach can not be used in practical calculations  instead one uses a mean field in which each particle moves in an `` external '' potential . in this case",
    "the total momentum is not fixed , and a lagrange multiplier term needs to be included in order to avoid solutions with infinite lf momentum .    in order to fix this potential problem with `` runaway solutions '' ( @xmath83 ) to variational calculations for lf hamiltonians , any term proportional to @xmath0 would suffice . however , by setting the coefficient for the term proportional to @xmath0 equal to one , _",
    "i.e. _ minimizing @xmath2 , one automatically guarantees that @xmath84 ( or @xmath85 ) .",
    "the reason is that , using covariance , @xmath1 has eigenvalues of the form @xmath86 ,",
    "_ i.e. _ it scales like @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , when one minimizes @xmath88 with respect to @xmath0 , the minimum occurs for @xmath89 , which yields @xmath90 as well .",
    "this `` equipartition '' between @xmath0 and @xmath1 thus arises since the two operators scale in exactly opposite ways under longitudinal boosts .",
    "note that this is quite analogous to the nonrelativistic harmonic oscillator where , under scale transformations , potential and kinetic energy scale in opposite ways , resulting in the equipartition between potential and kinetic energy .",
    "the net result is that we minimize the sum of @xmath91 .",
    "the need to include the plus - momentum can also be seen in a simple example .",
    "consider a nucleus of @xmath7 nucleons of momentum @xmath92 , @xmath93 , which consists of a nucleon of momentum @xmath94 , and a residual @xmath95 nucleon system which must have momentum @xmath96 .",
