    "more than 20 groups worldwide are now engaged in photometric surveys aimed at detecting jupiter - sized planets in tight orbits about their parent stars ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several of these projects",
    "are small , automated systems with modest apertures ( typically 10  cm ) and ccd cameras ( typically 2k  @xmath8  2k arrays of @xmath9 m pixels ) , which monitor several thousand stars simultaneously in a very wide field - of - view ( @xmath10  square ) . examples of such instruments are stare ( * ? ? ?",
    "* located on tenerife ) , psst  [ located in northern arizona ] , sleuth ( * ? ? ?",

    "* located in central california ) and vulcan south ] [ to be located at the south pole ] , hat ( * ? ? ?",
    "* located in southern arizona ) , and superwasp ( * ? ?",
    "* located on la palma ) .",
    "the advantage that all such projects offer over deeper transit surveys is the brightness of the target stars ( typically @xmath11 ) , which facilitates radial velocity measurements aimed at detecting the orbit induced by the planet .",
    "furthermore , it is only for such bright systems that the host of follow - up measurements that are currently being pursued for hd  209458 @xcite and other bright extrasolar - planet stars @xcite might also be enabled .",
    "the difficulty facing such surveys is not that of obtaining the requisite photometric precision or phase coverage , as several of the aforementioned projects have achieved these requirements .",
    "rather , the current challenge is that of efficiently rejecting astrophysical false positives , i.e. systems containing an eclipsing binary , whose resulting photometric light curves mimic that of a jupiter passing in front of a sun - like star .",
    "brown @xcite recently presented detailed estimates of rates of such false alarms for these wide - field surveys .",
    "the three dominant sources of such signals are ( 1 ) grazing incidence eclipses in systems consisting of two main - sequence stars , ( 2 ) central transits of low - mass stars in front of large main - sequence stars ( typically m - dwarfs passing in front of f - stars ) , and ( 3 ) binary systems undergoing deep eclipses , blended with the light of a third star that falls within the instrumental point - spread - function ( the blending star may be either physically associated or simply lying along the line - of - sight ) .",
    "brown finds that these various forms of astrophsyical false positives will likely occur at a combined rate nearly 12 times that of true planetary transits .",
    "a direct means to investigate the true nature of each candidate would be high - precision radial - velocity monitoring , but this would impose a hefty burden upon the large telescopes that are required .",
    "thus , all such transit surveys must adopt strategies for efficiently rejecting the majority of such false alarms , to bring the number of candidates to a manageable level .",
    "for the benefit of researchers pursuing such transit surveys , we present here several examples of astrophysical false positives .",
    "these candidate transit signals were identified in a survey of a @xmath12 field in auriga by the psst instrument at lowell observatory .",
    "a description of the instrument and the results of the survey will be presented elsewhere .",
    "our goal here is to present the follow - up spectroscopy performed with the palomar 60-inch telescope , which demonstrates conclusively that these candidates are indeed false alarms .",
    "access to telescopes in the range of @xmath13  m is widely available . as a result ,",
    "such observations are a reasonable means by which to dispose of such contaminants .",
    "similar work to identify the true nature of candidates arising from the vulcan survey was presented in @xcite .",
    "the psst photometric light curve ( figure  1 ) for star  1907 ( @xmath14 , @xmath0 ) revealed a flat - bottomed transit with a period of 3.80  days , a depth of 0.019  mag and a duration of 3.7  hours .",
    "the light curve is constant outside of eclipse .",
    "however , radial velocities ( figure  2 ) derived from high - resolution spectra gathered over 3 consecutive nights with the palomar 60-inch echelle spectrograph ( with a typical precision of @xmath15 ) revealed an orbit consistent with the period and phase derived by the photometry , but with an amplitude of @xmath1 .",
    "this large doppler variation indicates a low - mass stellar companion .",
    "the photometric time series ( figure  3 ) for star  2054 ( @xmath16 , @xmath2 ) shows a flat - bottomed eclipse with a period of 3.29  days , a depth of 0.023  mag , and a duration of 2.4  hours .",
    "the light curve is constant outside of eclipse .",
    "figure  4 shows a portion of the spectrum of this object gathered with the palomar 60-inch echelle in the region of the gravity - sensitive sodium  d lines .",
    "the unbroadened profile of the sodium features reveals this star to be a k - giant . since a 3.3  day orbit about a k - giant would place it within the physical radius of the star",
    ", we must be seeing a blend of a k - giant and a fainter eclipsing binary ( which may or may not be physically associated ) .",
    "the photometric light curve ( figure  5 ) for star  3549 ( @xmath17 , @xmath3 ) shows a mildly v - shaped eclipse with a period of 2.41  days , a depth of 0.028  mag , and a duration of 4.3  hours .",
    "our suspicions were raised by the hint of a faint secondary eclipse in the light curve .",
    "examination of the digitized sky survey image ( figure  6 ) reveals two sources within the psf of the psst instrument .",
    "photometry of the field during the time of a subsequent eclipse ( conducted with a 14-inch telescope , which afforded a significant increase in the angular resolution over the data gathered with the psst ) finds that the central brighter source is constant , whereas the fainter star to the ne undergoes a deep ( 14% ) eclipse ( figure  6 ) .",
    "when the light from both stars in summed in a single photometric aperture , the light curve that results reproduces that observed by the psst .",
    "hence , this system is a blend of an eclipsing binary ( the fainter star to the ne ) , and the physically unassociated brighter star .",
    "the photometric light curve ( figure  7 ) for star  4922 ( @xmath18 , @xmath5 ) reveals a clearly v - shaped eclipse with a period of 1.52  days , a depth of 0.021  mag , and a duration of 2.0  hours .",
    "the light curve is constant outside of eclipse , but the shape of the transit already hints at a grazing - incidence eclipsing binary .",
    "palomar 60-inch echelle spectra ( figure  8) gathered on three consecutive nights clearly show two sets of absorption features , and nightly variations in the radial velocity of the components that are consistent with the time scale of the photometric period .",
    "the amplitude of the radial velocity orbit is approximately @xmath19 .",
    "combined with the v - shaped nature of the eclipses , these data lead us to conclude that this is a grazing - incidence main - sequence binary , with a true period that is twice the photometric period .",
    "the publicly - available usno - b catalog @xcite provides proper motions , which aid in constraining the distance of a star .",
    "typical errors in the proper motions from the usno - b catalog are @xmath20  mas / yr . objects with colors consistent with the target spectral types of k , g , or f and a high measured proper motion are likely dwarf stars , and thus good candidates . unfortunately , small proper motions are inconclusive : these stars could either be distant ( hence giants ) , or nearby dwarfs .",
    "in addition , colors from the 2mass catalog aid in separating dwarf stars from giants .",
    "brown @xcite illustrates that the @xmath21 colors from the 2mass catalog provide a useful discriminant : stars with @xmath22 are predominantly giants , whereas those with @xmath23 are almost exclusively dwarfs ( figure  9 ) .",
    "the target stars of wide - field transit surveys are those with radii less than 1.3  @xmath6 .",
    "the infrared colors of such stars extend into the intermediate region , so that the @xmath21 color is not a definitive test .",
    "nonetheless , candidates with very red colors ( @xmath24 ) are almost certainly giants and can be rejected .",
    "while the spectroscopy described in the previous section provides a reliable means to identify astrophysical false positives , it is labor- and resource - intensive . in order to more efficiently reject such contaminants , l.  kotredes and d.  charbonneau are currently assembling sherlock , an automated follow - up telescope for wide - field transit searches @xcite . working from a list of transit candidates , sherlock will calculate future times of eclipse , and conduct multi - color photometry of these targets , with an angular resolution that is significantly improved over the survey instruments .",
    "the large majority of false alarms should yield eclipse signals that are color - dependent , whereas planetary transits should be nearly color - independent ( except for the minor effects due to limb - darkening ) .",
    "sherlock will be deployed at palomar observatory in early 2004 , and will be available to follow up candidates identified by any of the wide - field transit searches .",
