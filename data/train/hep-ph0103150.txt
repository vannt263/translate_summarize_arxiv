    "hadrons are composite particles and therefore have a size .",
    "a quantitative measure of this size is the mean - square radius whose experimental value for the pion ( @xmath1 ) is @xcite @xmath2  fm .",
    "one determines it by first measuring the electro - magnetic form factor @xmath3 for sufficiently small values of the ( feynman - four- ) momentum transfer @xmath4 , and then taking the derivative at sufficiently small @xmath5 , _ i.e. _ @xmath6 the form factor can also be calculated .",
    "one of the most remarkable simplicities of the light - cone formalism is that one can write down exact expressions for the electro - magnetic form factors . as was first shown by drell and yan @xcite , it is advantageous to choose a special coordinate frame to compute form factors and other current matrix elements at space - like photon momentum . in the drell frame",
    "@xcite , the photon s momentum is transverse to the momentum of the incident hadron and the incident hadron can be directed along the @xmath7 direction .",
    "with such a choice the four - momentum transfer is @xmath8 , and the quark current can neither create pairs nor annihilate the vacuum @xcite .",
    "the space - like form factor for a hadron is just a sum of overlap integrals analogous to the corresponding non - relativistic formula @xcite : @xmath9     \\,\\psi_{n , s^\\prime}^\\star ( x_i,\\vec \\ell_\\perp{}_i,\\lambda_i )     \\,\\psi_{n , s } ( x_i,\\vec k_\\perp{}_i,\\lambda_i )   , \\label{eq:2}\\\\ \\mathrm{with}\\quad     \\vec \\ell _ { \\!\\perp i } & \\equiv &      \\cases { \\vec k _ { \\!\\perp i } - x_i \\vec q _ { \\!\\perp }             + \\vec q _ { \\!\\perp } ,    & \\hbox{for the struck quark , } \\cr             \\vec k _ { \\!\\perp i } - x_i \\vec q _ { \\!\\perp } ,                 & \\hbox{for all other partons.}\\cr } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath10 $ ] symbolize the convolution over all momentum and helicity space arguments of every @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the charge of the struck quark .",
    "this holds for any ( composite ) hadron and any initial or final spins @xmath13 , but is particularly simple for a spin - zero hadron like a pion .",
    "the wave functions @xmath14 are the fock - space projections of the eigenstate which for a meson for example are @xmath15 .",
    "their computation is the aim of the light - cone approach to the bound - state problem in gauge theory @xcite , by solving @xmath16 , with the eigenvalues @xmath17 being the invariant mass - squares of the physical mesons .",
    "strictly speaking , the above expression for the form factor contains contributions from all fock space sectors . in this work ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the lowest fock space projection consisting of a @xmath18 pair .",
    "there exists a nonzero probability of finding the pion in its valence state , which can be calculated @xcite .",
    "it is known empirically , that the form factor at low @xmath5 has essentially monopole structure @xcite .",
    "the mean - square radius is essentially all the information there is for low @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , for the nucleon also , there are various effective three quark light - cone descriptions . in these models , without an explicit form of the effective potential in the light - cone hamiltonian for three - quarks , one proceeds with an ansatz for the momentum space wave function .",
    "both exponential @xcite and power law @xcite falloff of this wave function at large @xmath19 have been used . the low @xmath5 properties of the nucleon like the proton magnetic moment @xmath20 and its axial coupling @xmath21 have been investigated in these models @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the contributions from the higher fock components will only refine this initial approximation @xcite .",
    "we take the starting expression as , @xmath22 for the purpose of calculating its theoretical mean - square radius .",
    "the relation involves only the @xmath23 component of the general @xmath24 wave function , where @xmath25 is the ( normalized ) probability amplitude for finding the quarks with anti - parallel helicities , particularly for finding the @xmath26-quark with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath27 and transversal momentum @xmath28 , and the @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "their respective charges are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , with @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath24-component of the pion ( @xmath1 ) is available in numerical form , since it has been computed recently in the @xmath35-model @xcite . but the three - dimensional numerical integration of eq.([eq:4 ] ) and it subsequent derivation with respect to @xmath5 is cumbersome and may be numerically inaccurate .",
    "the aim of the present work is therefore to calculate the mean - square radius @xmath36 analytically by a suitable parametrization of the numerical wave function @xmath37 .",
    "the general procedure outlined in the subsequent sections is applicable also to more general cases .",
    "usually , one is able to write down an integral equation in the three variables @xmath27 and @xmath38 for the wavefunction @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the solution of such an equation is numerically nontrivial , among other reasons , because the longitudinal momentum fractions are limited to @xmath40 .",
    "it is therefore advantageous to substitute the integration variable @xmath27 by another variable @xmath41 which has the same range than either of the two transversal momenta @xmath38 . for unequal quark masses ,",
    "the transformation is defined as , @xmath42 with @xmath43 . in the lowest order approximation , the effective quark masses @xmath44 .    for equal quark masses",
    "@xmath45 , the substitution is so simple that it can even be inverted , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath46 formally , the three integration variables @xmath47 and @xmath48 look like a conventional 3-vector @xmath49 .",
    "if one substitutes , in addition , the unknown function @xmath39 by an other unknown function @xmath50 according to @xmath51 one gets an identical integral equation in the three variables @xmath52 , which looks like an integral equation in usual momentum space . in the @xmath35-model @xcite , the integral equation is further simplified and at the end looks very simple indeed , @xmath53",

    "the calculated eigenvalue for the ground state agrees with the pion mass - squared to a high degree of accuracy , and is stable with respect to changes in @xmath59 ( renormalization ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : b1 ] , it behaves like a power law @xmath60 , rather than as anticipated in @xcite like a gaussian @xmath61 . as shown in appendix .",
    "[ app : a ] , a value of @xmath62 is more likely than others and a fit of @xmath63 , @xmath64 reproduces the numerical wave function quite well as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : b1 ] , with albeit a comparatively large bohr momentum @xmath63 . expressing the latter in a length ,",
    "the value of @xmath65  fm ( similar to the experimental rms ) is no numerical co - incidence , but the result of a constraint on the procedure in @xcite .",
    "one should emphasize that only @xmath39 but not @xmath66 is a probability amplitude , and that the two can differ appreciably from each other according to eq.([eq : psi ] ) , particularly for a large bohr momentum @xmath67 as in eq.([eq : ff ] ) .",
    "disregarding this proviso , and mistaking @xmath68 as a probability amplitude for finding the particle with relative momentum @xmath69 , the calculation of the rms - radius would be trivial : one takes the fourier transform of eq.([eq : ff ] ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath70\\simeq\\exp{(-p_a r)}$ ] , and calculates its second moment to be @xmath71 however , as the variable conjugate to the relative momentum @xmath69 , the quantity @xmath72 is the _ relative distance _ of the particles .",
    "it is _ not the radius - distance _ from the common center - of - mass , with respect to which the rms is usually calculated .",
    "the latter is @xmath73 for equal mass particles , thus @xmath74 it will be referred to as the ` non - relativistic estimate ' , since the above construction holds approximately if @xmath75 and @xmath76 , thus @xmath77 according to eq.([eq : xkz ] ) .",
    "the question we pursue in the present work is thus : how large is the discrepancy between the non - relativistic estimate of eq.([eq:7 ] ) and the quasi - exact form factor according to eq.([eq:4 ] ) and its behaviour for low @xmath5 according to eq.([eq:1 ] ) , particularly for large bohr momenta .    before proceeding with the computation of the form factor ,",
    "a number of notational definitions will be introduced , in terms of which the final results turn out to be simple .",
    "once one has @xmath50 in a parametrized form like eq.([eq : ff ] ) one can transform back to the variables @xmath27 and @xmath38 . since @xmath78 one can use eq.([eq : xkz ] ) to get @xmath79 the dimensionless variable @xmath80 is introduced conveniently as @xmath81 as well as the isolation of the pure @xmath27-dependence by @xmath82 the combination @xmath83 is then trivially obtained by @xmath84 .",
    "one can thus compute the form factor according to eq.([eq:4 ] ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath85 the function @xmath86 and @xmath87 contain all the difficulty in the problem , @xmath88 that is the integration over the angle @xmath89 between @xmath28 and @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "finally the size parameter is introduced , @xmath92 as a dimensionless measure of the size .",
    "since the quarks move highly relativistically ( @xmath93 ) and one can not disregard the factor @xmath94 in eq.([eq : psi ] ) . one way to account for that is to parametrize directly @xmath95 with the two adjustable parameters @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "we have performed two fits , for two fixed values of @xmath96 , and have calculated analytically the size parameter @xmath13 according to eq.([eq : size ] ) .",
