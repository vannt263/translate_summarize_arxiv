    ", i.e.  improved gauge action might well be important .",
    "one possible way of constructing non - perturbatively improved lattice gauge theories is provided by the fixed point ( fp ) action approach @xcite .",
    "fp actions are classically perfect , i.e.  they have no lattice artefacts on classical configurations . in particular , they possess exactly scale invariant instanton solutions .",
    "together with fermion fp actions they form appealing formulations of non - perturbatively improved lattice qcd @xcite .    here",
    "we present a new parametrization for fp gauge actions which we apply to su(3 ) .",
    "the new parametrization is much more flexible and has a richer structure than the loop parametrizations studied so far @xcite and therefore allows to better reproduce the classical properties of the theory . in order to check the scaling behaviour of the parametrized fp action",
    "we perform a series of simulations in which we determine the critical temperature of the deconfining phase transition , the static @xmath4 potential and glueball masses .",
    "this paper summarizes some of the results @xcite .",
    "we consider su(@xmath5 ) pure gauge theory in four dimensional euclidean space - time on a periodic lattice .",
    "for asymptotically free theories the determination of the fp action reduces to a saddle point problem encoded in the fp equation @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the fp action , @xmath8 is the blocking kernel of a renormalization group ( rg ) transformation and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the gauge fields on the fine and coarse lattice , respectively .",
    "we use the rg transformation of ref .",

    "( [ eq : fp_equation ] ) represents an implicit equation for the fp action which , in principle , contains infinitely many couplings . in order to use it in mc simulations one",
    "has to find an appropriate parametrization .",
    "the main novelty in the new parametrization of the fp gauge action is the use of smeared ( `` fat '' ) links which are used to build simple wilson loop plaquettes @xcite . to build a plaquette in the @xmath11-plane from smeared links we introduce asymmetrically smeared links : instead of summing up all staples contributing to a smeared link we are suppressing the staples lying in the @xmath11-plane relative to those in the orthogonal planes @xmath12 , @xmath13 . in this way we are able to effectively generate long and complicated loops which , however , are still very compact .    from these `` smeared '' loops",
    "@xmath14 and from the unsmeared standard wilson loop @xmath15 we construct smeared and unsmeared plaquette variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , @xmath18 which in turn are used in a mixed polynomial ansatz for the fp action @xmath19=\\frac{1}{n_c}\\sum_{x,\\mu<\\nu}\\sum_{k , l } p_{kl}\\,u_{\\mu\\nu}(x)^k\\ , w_{\\mu\\nu}(x)^l\\,.\\ ] ] the linear parameters @xmath20 and the non - linear ones entering the smearing are determined through eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp_equation ] ) which is used recursively connecting coarse configurations to smoother and smoother ones . on the smoothest configuration we use the analytically calculable quadratic approximation to the fp action as the starting point @xcite .",
    "an additional novelty is the use of local information stored in the fine configurations minimizing the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fp_equation ] ) for the fitting procedure .",
    "obviously the minimizing configurations contain much more information than just the total value of the action . to explore this information",
    "we calculate the derivatives of the fp action with respect to the gauge links in a given colour direction at each site and , together with the action values , include them in the fitting procedure for determining the parameters .",
    "the final parametrization @xcite obtained in this way contains five non - linear parameters entering the smearing and 14 linear ones @xmath21 describing the mixed polynomial in eq .",
    "( [ eq : polynomial ansatz ] ) .",
    "using the parametrized fp action we perform a large number of simulations on coarse lattices with lattice spacings @xmath22 between 0.1 and 0.33 fm in order to explore the scaling behaviour of different physical quantities . in all simulations",
    "we generate independent gauge configurations using a mixture of metropolis and overrelaxation updates . wherever it is applicable we make use of smearing techniques and",
    "employ variational techniques to increase the overlap of wave functions with the ground state @xcite .",
    "we first measure the critical temperature of the deconfining phase transition using the polyakov loop @xmath23 as an order parameter . to do",
    "so we determine the critical couplings on lattices with temporal extent @xmath24 and 4 and various spatial volumes from the location of the peak in the polyakov loop susceptibility , @xmath25 the location of the peak can be determined very precisely by a spectral density reweighting @xcite which combines the data of many simulations at values of the gauge coupling near the critical value . in order to perform the thermodynamic limit we resort to the finite scaling behaviour linear in @xmath26 as expected for a first order phase transition .",
    "the results from these extrapolations are @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "finally , the critical temperature is determined through @xmath29 .",
    "one way of examining the scaling of the parametrized fp action is by measuring the static @xmath30 potential @xmath31 in terms of the hadronic scale @xmath0 and comparing the quantity @xmath32 versus @xmath33 at several values of @xmath34 ( see figure [ fig : all_pot ] ) .",
    "potential @xmath31 expressed in terms of the hadronic scale @xmath0 .",
    ", width=283 ]    we would like to stress that on coarse lattices this a non - trivial scaling test .",
    "the quality of our measurements can be seen for example by comparing our fit ( dashed line ) of the form coulomb plus linear term with the result ( dotted line ) from measurements with an anisotropic tadpole / tree level symanzik improved action @xcite .",
    "the hadronic scale used above is determined from the force @xmath35 between two static quarks .",
    "we use @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "however , since eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_hadronic_scale ] ) needs an interpolation of the force in between lattice sites , on coarse lattices this definition of the scale is plagued by ambiguities stemming from the discreteness of the lattice points .",
    "another physical quantity of interest is the string tension @xmath1 which describes the asymptotic long range behaviour of the potential .",
    "note , that here we do not aim at testing the rotational invariance of the potential .",
    "for the rgt used here this has been done at finite temperature , however , using a different parametrization of the fp action @xcite .",
    "we are now in a position to investigate the scaling behaviour of the parametrized fp action by means of the rg invariant quantities @xmath38 and @xmath39 .     for different actions.,width=283 ]",
    "we find that these quantities scale even on lattices as coarse as @xmath40 fm @xcite . as an example we display the results for @xmath41 in figure [ fig : sigmatc ] together with results obtained with different other actions @xcite .",
    "in the pure gauge glueball spectrum the lowest - lying @xmath42 state shows particularly large cut - off effects when measured with the wilson action .",
    "it therefore provides an excellent candidate for sizing the improvements achieved with the parametrized fp action .",
    "to do so we perform simulations at three different lattice spacings in the range @xmath43 and spatial volumes between ( 1.4  fm)@xmath44 and ( 1.8  fm)@xmath44 .",
    "the scale is set by @xmath0 as determined in the previous section .",
    "we measure all length eight loops on five smearing levels in order to construct a wave function with a large overlap to the ground state . in figure [ fig:0pp_final ]",
    "we compare the results for the lowest lying @xmath42 glueball mass measured with the wilson action @xcite , the anisotropic tadpole / tree level symanzik improved action @xcite and the fp action .",
    "glueball.,width=283 ]    performing the continuum limit and using @xmath45 fm we obtain a mass of @xmath46 mev for the @xmath42 glueball .",
    "finally , we also determine the @xmath47 glueball mass at a lattice spacing @xmath48 fm and obtain @xmath49 mev @xcite .",
    "measuring glueball states on rather coarse lattices immediately calls for anisotropic gauge actions .",
    "the construction of such an action using the fp approach is under way @xcite .",
    "the new parametrization presented here provides a method for approximating fp gauge actions which is very general and flexible but still simple .",
    "it is possible to describe the fp actions accurately enough so that their classical properties are preserved .",
    "however , it is necessary to check the range of validity of the parametrized fp action . in view of future applications of the action in connection with a parametrized fp dirac operator @xcite",
    "this is of crucial importance .",
    "in addition , one has to assure that no pathologies are introduced through the parametrization .",
    "for the quantities and lattice spacings investigated so far we find that this is indeed the case .",
    "in particular , we find that these physical quantities scale even on lattices as coarse as @xmath50 fm .",
