    "the study of norm attaining operators started with a celebrated paper by j.  lindenstrauss of 1963 @xcite .",
    "there , he provided examples of pairs of banach spaces such that there are ( bounded linear ) operators between them which can not be approximated by norm attaining operators . also , sufficient conditions on the domain space or on the range space providing the density of norm attaining operators were given .",
    "we recall that an operator @xmath0 between two banach spaces @xmath1 and @xmath2 is said to _ attain its norm _ whenever there is @xmath3 with @xmath4 such that @xmath5 ( that is , the supremum defining the operator norm is actually a maximum ) .",
    "very recently , it has been shown that there exist compact linear operators between banach spaces which can not be approximated by norm attaining operators @xcite , solving a question that has remained open since the 1970s .",
    "we recall that an operator between banach spaces is _ compact _ if it carries bounded sets into relatively compact sets or , equivalently , if the closure of the image of the unit ball is compact . after the cited result of @xcite",
    ", it makes more sense to discuss sufficient conditions on the domain or on the range space ensuring density of norm attaining compact operators .",
    "the objective of this expository paper is to present the give a picture of old and new developments in this topic .",
    "let us first make some remarks about the existence of compact operators which do not attain their norm .",
    "it is clear that if the domain of a linear operator is a finite - dimensional space , then the image by it of the unit ball is actually compact and , therefore , the operator automatically attains its norm .",
    "this argument extends to infinite - dimensional reflexive spaces . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath1 is a reflexive space , every compact operator from @xmath1 into a banach space @xmath2 is completely continuous ( i.e.  it maps weakly convergent sequences into norm convergent sequences , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem 30 in p.  515 ) for instance ) and so the weak ( sequential ) compactness of the unit ball of @xmath1 gives easily the result .",
    "we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  6 in p.  16 ) for a discussion on when all bounded linear operators between reflexive spaces attain their norm . on the other hand , for every non - reflexive banach space @xmath1",
    "there is a continuous linear functional on @xmath1 which does not attain its norm ( james theorem , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2 in p.  7 ) for instance ) .",
    "the multiplication of such functional by a fix non - zero vector of a banach space @xmath2 clearly produces a rank - one ( hence compact ) operator from @xmath1 into @xmath2 which does not attain its norm . as a final remark ,",
    "let us comment that for every infinite - dimensional banach space @xmath1 , there exists a bounded linear operator @xmath6 which does not attain its norm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  2.2 ) .",
    "let us present a brief account on classical results about density of norm attaining operators .",
    "the expository paper @xcite can be used for reference and background .",
    "we need some notation . given two ( real or complex ) banach spaces @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we write @xmath7 to denote the banach space of all bounded linear operators from @xmath1 into @xmath2 , endowed with the operator norm .",
    "by @xmath8 and @xmath9 we denote the subspaces of @xmath7 of compact operators and finite - rank operators , respectively .",
    "we write @xmath10 for the ( topological ) dual of @xmath1 , @xmath11 for the closed unit ball , and @xmath12 for the unit sphere .",
    "the set of norm attaining operators from @xmath1 into @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath13 . the study on norm attaining operators started as a negative answer by j.  lindenstrauss @xcite to the question of whether it is possible to extend to the vector valued case the classical bishop - phelps theorem of 1961 @xcite stating that the set of norm attaining functionals is always dense in the dual of a banach space .",
    "j.  lindenstrauss introduced two properties to study norm attaining operators : a banach space @xmath1 ( resp .",
    "@xmath2 ) has lindenstrauss _ property a _ ( resp .",
    "_ property b _ ) if @xmath14 is dense in @xmath15 ( resp .",
    "@xmath16 is dense in @xmath17 ) for every banach space @xmath18 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite , for instance , that @xmath19 , @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath21 $ ] fail property @xmath22 .",
    "examples of spaces having property a ( including reflexive spaces and @xmath23 ) and of spaces having property b ( including @xmath19 , @xmath24 and every finite - dimensional space whose unit ball is a polyhedron ) are also shown in that paper .",
    "there are many extensions of lindenstrauss results from which we will comment only a representative sample . with respect to property",
    "a , j.  bourgain showed in 1977 that every banach space with the radon - nikodm property have property a and that , conversely , if a banach space @xmath1 has property a in every equivalent norm , then it has the radon - nikodm property ( this direction needs a refinement due to r.  huff , 1980 ) . w.  schachermayer ( 1983 ) and b.  godun and s.  troyanski ( 1993 ) showed that `` almost '' every banach space can be equivalently renormed to have property a. with respect to property b , j.  partington proved that every banach space can be renormed to have property b ( 1982 ) and w.  schachermayer showed that @xmath20 $ ] fails the property ( 1983 ) .",
    "w.  gowers showed in 1990 that @xmath25 does not have property b for @xmath26 , a result extended by m.  acosta ( 1999 ) to all infinite - dimensional strictly convex banach spaces and to infinite - dimensional @xmath27 spaces .",
    "with respect to pairs of classical banach spaces not covered by the above results , j.  johnson and j.  wolfe ( 1979 ) proved that , in the real case , @xmath28 is dense in @xmath29 for all compact spaces @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and c.  finet and r.  pay ( 1998 ) showed the same result for the pair @xmath32,l_\\infty[0,1])$ ] .",
    "concerning the study of norm attaining compact operators , j.  diestel and j.  uhl ( 1976 ) @xcite showed that norm attaining finite - rank operators from @xmath27 into any banach space are dense in the space of all compact operators .",
    "this study was continued by j.  johnson and j.  wolfe @xcite ( 1979 ) , who proved the same result when the domain space is a @xmath33 space or the range space is an @xmath34-space ( only real case ) or a predual of an @xmath34-space . in 2013 , b.  cascales , a.  guirao , and v.  kadets ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.6 ) showed that for every uniform algebra ( in particular , the disk algebra @xmath35 ) , the set of norm attaining compact operators arriving to the algebra is dense in the set of all compact operators .",
    "as we already mention , we would like to review here known results about density of norm attaining compact operators . as this question is too general , and imitating what lindenstrauss did in 1963 , we introduce the following two properties .",
    "let @xmath1 , @xmath2 be banach spaces .    1 .",
    "@xmath1 is said to satisfy _ property a@xmath36 _ if @xmath37 is dense in @xmath38 for every banach space @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath2 is said to satisfy _",
    "property b@xmath39 _ if @xmath40 is dense in @xmath41 for every banach space @xmath18 .",
    "our first observation is that it is not clear whether , in general , property a implies property a@xmath36 or property b implies property b@xmath39 .",
    "[ question : a=>ak ] does lindenstrauss property a imply property a@xmath36 ?",
    "[ question : b=>bk ] does lindenstrauss property b imply property b@xmath39 ?    nevertheless , all sufficient conditions for lindenstrauss properties a and b listed above also implies , respectively , properties a@xmath36  and b@xmath39 .",
    "this is so because the usual way of establishing the density of norm attaining operators is by proving that every operator can be approximated by compact perturbations of it attaining the norm .",
    "besides of these examples , most of the known results which are specific for compact operators depend on some stronger forms of the approximation property .",
    "let us recall the basic principles of this concept .",
    "we refer to the classical book @xcite for background and to @xcite for a more updated account . a banach space",
    "@xmath1 has the ( grothendieck ) _",
    "approximation property _ if for every compact set @xmath30 and every @xmath42 , there is @xmath43 such that @xmath44 for all @xmath45 .",
    "useful and classical results about the approximation theory are the following .",
    "[ prop - ap ] let @xmath1 , @xmath2 be banach spaces .    1 .",
    "@xmath2 has the approximation property if and only if @xmath46 for every banach space @xmath18 .",
    "2 .   @xmath10 has the approximation property if and only if @xmath47 for every banach space @xmath18 .",
    "3 .   if @xmath10 has the approximation property , then so does @xmath1 .",
    "4 .   ( enflo ) there exist banach spaces without the approximation property . actually , there are closed subspaces of @xmath19 failing the approximation property .",
    "what is the relation between the approximation property and norm attaining compact operators ? on the one hand , the negative examples given in @xcite exploit the failure of the approximation property of some subspaces of @xmath19 together with an easy extension of a geometrical property proved by lindenstrauss for @xmath19 ( see section  [ sec : negative ] for details ) . on the other hand , most of the positive results for properties a@xmath36 and b@xmath39 which are not related to lindenstrauss properties a and b use some strong form of the approximation property .",
    "actually , all positive results in this line try to give a partial answer to one of the following two open questions .",
    "[ question - ap - bk ] does the approximation property imply property b@xmath39 ?",
    "[ question - dual - ap - ak ] does every banach space whose dual has the approximation property have property a@xmath36 ?    by proposition  [ prop - ap].a , question  [ question - ap - bk ] is equivalent to the following one , which is considered one of the most important open questions in the theory of norm attaining operators .",
    "[ question - fin - dim - b ] does every finite - dimensional banach space have lindenstrauss property b ?    surprisingly , this question is open even for the two - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : negative ] contains a detailed explanation of the negative examples presented in @xcite and some new examples .",
    "we also use the techniques to present a couple of negative results on lindenstrauss properties a and b.    in section  [ sec : domain ] we collect all results about property a@xmath36 .",
    "we start by listing the main known examples of banach spaces with lindenstrauss property a since all of them have property a@xmath36 .",
    "next , we show that an stronger version of the approximation property of the dual of a banach space implies property a@xmath36 @xcite .",
    "most of the examples of spaces with property a@xmath36 given in the literature are actually proved in this way , as @xmath27 spaces , @xmath48 spaces .",
    "we are even able to produce some new examples as the preduals of @xmath23 and @xmath49-embedded banach spaces with monotone basis .",
    "the results for range spaces appear in section  [ sec : range ] .",
    "again , we start with a list of known examples of banach spaces with lindenstrauss property b which also have property b@xmath39 .",
    "next , we provide two partial positive answers to question  [ question - ap - bk ] ( i.e.  whether the approximation property implies property b@xmath39 ) .",
    "the first one is very simple : suppose that a banach space @xmath2 has the approximation property and every finite - dimensional subspace of it is contained in another subspace of @xmath2 having property b@xmath39 .",
    "then , the whole space @xmath2 has property b@xmath39 .",
    "the second sufficient condition deals with the existence of a bounded net of projections converging to the identity in the strong operator topology and such that their ranges have property b@xmath39 .",
    "these two ideas lead to a list including most of the known examples of banach spaces with property b@xmath39 : preduals of @xmath27 spaces ( in particular , @xmath48 spaces ) , real @xmath27 spaces , and polyhedral banach spaces with the approximation property ( in particular , subspaces of @xmath19 with the approximation property , both in the real and in the complex case ) .",
    "besides these examples , uniform algebras have been very recently proved to have property b@xmath39 @xcite .",
    "we would like to finish this introduction with some comments about the complex case of bishop - phelps theorem and its relation to question  [ question - fin - dim - b ] for the two dimensional real hilbert space .",
    "first , let us comment that there is a complex version of the bishop - phelps theorem , easily deductible from the real case , which states that for every complex banach space @xmath1 , complex - linear norm attaining functionals from @xmath1 into @xmath50 are dense in @xmath51 ( see @xcite or @xcite ) . but this does not imply that @xmath50 viewed as the real two - dimensional hilbert space have lindenstrauss property b , as it does not allow to work with operators which are not complex - linear . on the other hand , v.  lomonosov showed in 2000 @xcite",
    "that there is a complex banach space @xmath1 and a ( non - complex symmetric ) closed convex bounded subset @xmath52 of @xmath1 such that there is no element in @xmath10 attaining the supremum of its modulus on @xmath52 .",
    "our goal here is to present the recent results in @xcite providing examples of compact operators which can not be approximated by norm attaining operators .",
    "the key idea is to combine the approximation property with the following simple geometric idea .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be banach spaces and let @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 attains its norm at a point @xmath55 which is not an extreme point of @xmath11 , let @xmath56 be such that @xmath57 and observe that @xmath58 .",
    "if @xmath59 is an extreme point of @xmath60 , then @xmath61 . summarizing : @xmath62 two remarks are pertinent",
    "first , the most number of vectors @xmath63 s we may use in the above equation , the most information we get about @xmath0 .",
    "second , to get that @xmath64 is an extreme point , the easiest way is to require that all points in @xmath65 are extreme points of @xmath60 , that is , that @xmath2 is _",
    "strictly convex_.        observe that geometrically , this argument means that an operator into a strictly convex banach space which attains its norm in the interior of a face of the unit sphere carries the whole face to the same point ( see figure  [ figure ] ) .",
    "next , suppose that the set of @xmath63 s working in generate a finite - codimensional subspace .",
    "then @xmath0 has finite - rank .",
    "we have proved the key ingredient for all the examples .",
    "[ lemma : geometrical - key ] let @xmath1 , @xmath2 be banach spaces .",
    "suppose that for every @xmath55 the closed linear span of the set of those @xmath56 such that @xmath66 is finite - codimensional and that @xmath2 is strictly convex .",
    "then , @xmath67 .",
    "this result was used by j.  lindenstrauss @xcite to give a direct proof of the fact that @xmath19 fails property a ( this result is deductible from earlier parts in the same paper ) .",
    "how was this done ? just observing that for every @xmath68 , there is @xmath69 such that @xmath70 for every @xmath71 and that there is a strictly convex banach space @xmath2 isomorphic to @xmath19 .",
    "the isomorphism from @xmath19 into @xmath2 is not compact and so it can not be approximated by norm attaining operators by lemma  [ lemma : geometrical - key ] . the argument also shows that strictly convex renorming of @xmath19 do not have property b. similar arguments like the above ones , replacing @xmath19 by suitable banach spaces , have been used by t.  gowers @xcite to show that @xmath25 fails lindenstrauss property b , and by m.  acosta @xcite to show that no infinite - dimensional strictly convex banach space nor infinite - dimensional @xmath27 space has lindenstrauss property b.    but let us return to compact operators . instead of looking for a non - compact operator which can not be approximated by norm attaining operators using lemma  [ lemma : geometrical - key ] , what is done in @xcite is to use domain spaces without the approximation property .",
    "the key idea there is that lindenstrauss argument for @xmath19 extends to all of its closed subspaces .",
    "[ lemma - c0-noextreme ] let @xmath1 be a closed subspace of @xmath19 .",

    "fix @xmath55 . as @xmath72 , there is @xmath69 such that @xmath73 for every @xmath71 .",
    "now , consider the finite - codimensional subspace of @xmath1 given by @xmath74 and observe that for every @xmath75 with @xmath76 , we have @xmath77 .    therefore ,",
    "combining this result with lemma  [ lemma : geometrical - key ] , we get the following .",
    "[ corollary : xsubc0ystrictlyconvex ] let @xmath1 be a closed subspace of @xmath19 and let @xmath2 be a strictly convex banach space .",

    "what is next ?",
    "we just have to recall the approximation property and use proposition  [ prop - ap ] .",
    "pick a closed subspace @xmath1 of @xmath19 without the approximation property .",
    "then , @xmath10 also fails the approximation property , so there is a banach space @xmath2 and @xmath78 which is not in the closure of @xmath9 .",
    "considering @xmath2 as the range of @xmath0 , which is separable , we may suppose that @xmath2 is strictly convex ( using an equivalent renorming , see @xcite ) .",
