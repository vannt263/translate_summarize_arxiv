    "<S> geometric phases arise naturally in a variety of quantum systems with observable consequences . </S>",
    "<S> they also arise in quantum computations when dressed states are used in gating operations . here </S>",
    "<S> we show how they arise in these gating operations and how one may take advantage of the dressed states producing them . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we show that that for a given , but arbitrary hamiltonian , and at an arbitrary time @xmath0 , there _ always exists _ a set of dressed states such that a given gate operation can be performed by the hamiltonian up to a phase @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the phase is a sum of a dynamical phase and a geometric phase . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the new phase for several systems .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction. _ quantum gates are the building blocks for quantum computers and are necessary for a vast array of quantum mechanical devices . </S>",
    "<S> quantum gates appear in a wide variety of forms and range in complexity from simple single - qubit rotations to highly sophisticated multi - qubit , or more generally , multi - qudit designs . </S>",
    "<S> an ideal gating operation will produce a coherent unitary evolution of a quantum state in such a way as to realize the desired transformation of the system of interest with perfect fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> finding a universal set of these operations which can manipulate and entangle collections of qubits is one of the most important tasks in quantum computing . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , unitary - evolution - based quantum computation relies on a processor s ability to manipulate superpositions as well as create and destroy an entanglement using a sequence of these gates . </S>",
    "<S> when a particular gate is required , for whatever the reason may be , one typically has a specific hamiltonian in mind to generate the corresponding evolution . in some cases </S>",
    "<S> , the implementation of a quantum gate can be carried out using the interactions which are naturally available to the system , as , for instance , in the case of transferring information between processors using the always - on heisenberg interactions occurring between sites of a spin chain @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is usually not so simple however , generally one needs to control these gating operations using external fields or other mechanisms , such as measurements . in order to accomplish a specific computational goal one must first identify a physical system which can effectively serve as a collection of qubits , initiate the system to an appropriate state , and then force the system to evolve according to the combined system / external hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> . we will show here that there always exists a complete set of states which , when acted upon by an arbitrary evolution operator , can produce any given gate , up to an additional phase factor . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that a part of this phase factor has a geometrical nature similar to the aharonov - anandan ( a - a ) phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that proper initialization , which can experimentally be different from initializing to the ground state , can be used as a resource for individual quantum gating operations .    over the years </S>",
    "<S> the geometric phase has been a topic of central interest in quantum mechanics @xcite . unlike the dynamical phase which depends on the dynamical evolution of the system , e.g. , the speed at which the parameterized path is followed or the arbitrary choice of gauge , the geometrical phase is completely determined by a closed trajectory of the system in the underlying parameter space and does not depend on the details of the temporal evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the geometrical phase is a measurable quantity and can be used to investigate the nontrivial geometric properties of the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> it can be observed in the interference of two identically prepared systems as they develop a relative phase while either system is adiabatically varied . </S>",
    "<S> it can also be observed in single quantum systems which are prepared in superpositions of eigenstates of the hamiltonian . in this case </S>",
    "<S> each eigenstate can establish a geometric phase as the hamiltonian is varied , and the differences between these phases can be observed by the measurable properties of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> it was berry @xcite who first noticed the fact that a wave function , originally in a nondegenerate eigenstate of the initial hamiltonian , will acquire a geometrical phase factor in addition to the familiar dynamical phase if the evolution is induced by a hamiltonian which is varied adiabatically around a closed path in parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> later , aharonov and anandan @xcite examined a generalization of the berry phase without recourse to adiabaticity . </S>",
    "<S> their work showed how any closed path in the projective hilbert space of state vectors modulo phase factors has a geometric phase associated with it regardless of any adiabatic conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> here , we introduce a family of geometric phases which are associated with quantum gating operations . </S>",
    "<S> as we have just mentioned , we will show that it is possible for any hamiltonian to mimic the action of a specified yet arbitrary gate provided that the system is initialized to an appropriate state . </S>",
    "<S> the geometrical contribution of the phase acquired by this quantum evolution can be calculated in a way that is similar to the usual prescription given by aharonov and anandan . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation the geometrical phase associated with the gating operation can be determined using a dressed hamiltonian which generates a cyclic evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> we will begin our discussion of these results with an example that clearly illustrates the nature of the geometrical phase obtained by the cyclic evolution of a state of a spin chain . </S>",
    "<S> the example should help clarify part of the motivation behind this work , as it indicates the origin of a geometrical phase acquired by the non - cyclic evolution of a state through a gating operation .    </S>",
    "<S> _ example of perfect state transfer. _ let us start with an example of perfect state transfer  @xcite through a spin chain . </S>",
    "<S> consider an @xmath2-site nearest neighbor _ xy _ model @xmath3 when we engineer the tunneling integrals such that @xmath4 the hamiltonianbecomes @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the @xmath7-component of the quasi - angular momentum operator .    at time </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 the evolution operator associated with this hamiltonian becomes @xcite@xmath8when @xmath9 a spin - up state @xmath10 at site 1 is perfectly transferred to @xmath11 at the last site @xmath12 where @xmath13    </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the situation when @xmath14 , the system evolves cyclically , @xmath15 @xmath16 , except for a phase factor @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> if the number of sites @xmath2 is even , @xmath18 which is apparently a geometric phase factor since it originates from the geometrical length of the chain and is not related to the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , it is an aharonov - anandan ( a - a ) phase factor . </S>",
    "<S> the a - a phase factor exists for any cyclic evolution of a quantum system , defined by @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that cyclic evolutions of this type universally exist in any quantum system , regardless of the specific hamiltonian which generates the evolution , provided the system begins in an appropriate state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> now , we assume that the wave function is driven by the schrdinger equation @xmath20where we let @xmath21 throughout . </S>",
    "<S> aharonov and anandan found an expression which removed the the dynamical part from the total phase @xmath22 @xmath23where @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 is known as the a - a phase and is uniquely defined up to @xmath27 for some integer @xmath28 . </S>",

    "<S> the process of perfect state transfer @xmath33 @xmath34 does not correspond to a cyclic evolution . </S>",
    "<S> however , the above analysis implies that the phase factor @xmath35 , which originates similarly to the a - a phase factor @xmath36 should possess geometric attributes as well . we will exhibit the occurance of similar phenomena in various systems after general discussions .    </S>",
