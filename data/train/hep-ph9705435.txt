    "nuclei and electrons are bound by electromagnetic interactions that do not violate parity .",
    "however the exchange of a z gauge boson between the nucleus and the atomic electrons is parity violating .",
    "the dominant contribution arises from the vector coupling to the nucleus with the axial - vector coupling to the electrons , which allows normally forbidden transitions .",
    "the nuclear vector current is conserved and the nucleus acts as a source of the weak charge @xmath0 , which is a linear combination of the z vector coupling to up and down quarks : @xmath1\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the number of neutrons , @xmath3 the number of protons and @xmath4 at tree - level .",
    "the tree - level formula for the weak charge is modified by radiative corrections @xcite and by physics beyond the standard model , thus a precise determination of @xmath0 provides a test of these corrections and bounds on new physics , complementing the results of high energy colliders .",
    "theoretically the structure of cesium is the most accurately known ( @xmath5 ) @xcite among heavy atoms , as it is an alkali - metal atom and it can be described as a valence electron and a closed - shell tightly bound core which is relatively unpolarizable .",
    "recently a factor of 7 improvement in the measurement of parity - nonconserving transitions between the 6s and 7s states of @xmath6 was reported @xcite with the use of a spin polarized atomic beam .",
    "the nucleus has spin @xmath7 and the total angular momentum of the atomic @xmath8 states is then 3 or 4",
    ". the experiment measures both @xmath9 and @xmath10 transitions .",
    "the two measured transitions differ because of nuclear spin - dependent effects .",
    "a linear combination of the two values eliminates nuclear spin - dependent contributions , allowing a precise determination of the weak charge .",
    "the result of @xcite is : @xmath11 where the first error is experimental and the second one is the consequence of atomic theory uncertainty .",
    "contrary to previous data @xcite , the theoretical uncertainty dominates the error .",
    "the other linear combination allows a determination of the spin - dependent effects , mainly due to the anapole moment @xcite .",
    "however it involves strong interaction uncertainties and i will not discuss it in the following .    assuming",
    "the validity of the standard model one can extract the weinberg angle from @xmath0 , in order to have an idea of the constraints implied by the new cesium data . using the formulae of @xcite and the updated analysis of @xcite concerning the hadronic vacuum polarization corrections to @xmath12 mixing , in the @xmath13 scheme at the scale @xmath14 , and with a higgs mass of 300 gev",
    ", i find @xmath15 . in order to compare this result with lep data",
    "one should calculate instead @xmath16 , which is the usually quoted value , but the difference is tiny @xcite , and one can safely neglect it in the following considerations . from the previous determination one can see that in @xmath17 the error is reduced by a factor of two with respect to previous determinations from cesium @xcite .",
    "now the error is dominated by the atomic physics theoretical accuracy @xcite , which may improve in the near future to few parts in @xmath18 . the present error in the @xmath19 determination",
    "is an order of magnitude larger than the one quoted by lep , @xmath20 @xcite , but cesium is likely to play a more significant role in tests of the standard model in the future .",
    "for example assuming the atomic theory error to go down to 0.2% and the experimental error to stay the same , the induced error in the determination of @xmath19 would be 0.0013 .",
    "recently much interest was devoted to contact interactions and scalar leptoquarks as they might account for the excess of high @xmath21 events at hera @xcite in @xmath22 collisions .",
    "atomic parity violation puts severe bounds on quark - lepton four - fermion contact interactions @xcite .",
    "the relevant lagrangian is written in the form @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the contact interaction produces a shift of the weak charge : @xmath25 and using the experimental result for the weak charge @xcite and the theoretical standard model value @xmath26 of @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ dql ] ) gives the limits of table i , which are larger than those coming from high - energy colliders ( see for example @xcite and recent bounds by cdf @xcite and lep 2 @xcite ) .",
    "one should be careful , when comparing table i with the bounds reported in the literature , that the definition of @xmath27 may differ by a factor of @xmath28 .",
    "the limit coming from eq .",
    "( [ dql ] ) can however be eluded if the contact interactions are parity conserving or cancellations occur ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "let us now consider the low energy effects of scalar leptoquarks that couple chirally and diagonally to the first generation .",
    "`` chiral '' means that the leptoquark is coupled either to left - handed or to right - handed quarks but not to both , in order to avoid unacceptable deviations from lepton universality , for example in @xmath29 , while `` diagonal '' means that the leptoquark couples only to a single leptonic and quark generation ( at least approximately as the ckm matrix induces mixing for left - coupled leptoquarks , and as a consequence flavour changing neutral currents ) .",
    "i follow here the notation of @xcite , where previous cesium data was used to set bounds on the leptoquarks . from the general effective lagrangian satisfying baryon and lepton number conservation , with the most general dimensionless and @xmath30 invariant couplings @xcite",
    "one has scalar leptoquarks with the following quantum numbers with respect to @xmath31 : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 couple only to right - handed quarks , @xmath39 only to left - handed quarks , while @xmath8 and @xmath40 can couple to both .    in a class of supersymmetric theories",
    "it is natural to have @xmath41 , @xmath42 of type @xmath8 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 of type @xmath40 @xcite , where the subscripts @xmath45 and @xmath46 refer to the helicity of the quark coupled to the leptoquark .",
    "the requirement of having chiral couplings in the sense indicated before may therefore be fulfilled , if mixing between the left- and right - coupled leptoquarks is small .    in the following i",
    "shall be mainly interested in @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath38 leptoquarks , which are relevant in the discussion of the excess of high @xmath21 events at hera in @xmath22 collisions .",
    "their yukawa interactions are given by @xmath47 where for the @xmath43 i neglected second and third generation couplings , as the leptoquark is assumed to be diagonal to a good approximation .",
    "the superscript in parentheses in the previous formula refers to the leptoquark electromagnetic charge",
    ".    one can easily derive the effective low energy 4-fermion interaction due to leptoquark exchange and obtain the corresponding shift in the weak charge . in order to have a compact notation , it is useful to introduce the parameter @xmath48 which has the value 1 when the leptoquark @xmath49 is present and otherwise is zero .",
    "the contribution to @xmath0 is : @xmath50 \\label{qwlq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the fermi constant . using the experimental result for the weak charge @xcite and the theoretical standard model value @xmath26 of @xcite , one obtains the limits of table ii , in terms of the ratio leptoquark mass @xmath52 over coupling @xmath53 .",
    "limits from other experimental data can further constrain the leptoquarks , depending on the nature of the leptoquark , for example flavour changing neutral current limits or universality in leptonic @xmath54 decay .",
    "moreover note that the limits coming from eq.([qwlq ] ) are valid when one assumes that there is only one leptoquark multiplet and that there is no mass splitting within the multiplet ( for a detailed discussion see appendix b of @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of more than one leptoquark multiplet can both improve or reduce the bound , as different leptoquarks may contribute to the weak charge with the same or opposite sign .",
    "i will not analyse the implications of leptoquarks for the high-@xmath21 hera data in detail , as this is the subject of dedicated papers @xcite .",
    "note however that @xmath55 and @xmath38 leptoquarks are produced in @xmath22 collisions in the s - channel , whereas they contribute to @xmath56 non - resonantly .",
    "if a mass of 200 gev is assumed for the leptoquarks , a bound on the couplings can be derived , @xmath57 at 95 % c.l . while the coupling required to explain the hera anomaly is lower , of the order of 0.02 for a scalar leptoquark coupled to @xmath58 quarks ( like @xmath44 ) , and 0.04 if coupled to @xmath59 quarks ( like @xmath38 ) and thus within the permitted region .",
    "limits form cesium can be combined with direct leptoquark searches to perform a two parameter fit in the mass and coupling of the leptoquarks . in the following @xmath60 analyses a small number of events has to be compared with theory .",
    "i use for them the method of least squares with a @xmath60 function for poisson - distributed data , which asymptotically behaves like a classical @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the goodness - of - fit ( confidence level ) is evaluated approximatively as if data were gaussian - distributed .",
    "leptoquark production at tevatron is insensitive to the @xmath53 coupling ( the only requirement is @xmath61 due to the event reconstruction algorithms used in the experimental analysis ) , but detection of the leptoquark decay products depends on the leptoquark branching fraction to @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",

    "the leading order parton production cross - section @xcite was convoluted with parton distribution functions @xcite , at a scale @xmath64 ( this choice of the scale at leading order is supported by the next - to - leading result of @xcite ) , in order to produce the theoretical cross section at tevatron .",

    "2 shows the same limits assuming 50% branching to @xmath65 and 50% to @xmath66 .    assuming that the excess of events seen at high-@xmath21 in @xmath22 collisions at hera @xcite is due to the production of a scalar leptoquark",

    "the combined integrated luminosity of 34.3 pb@xmath67 from h1 and zeus collaborations at @xmath68 gev in the @xmath69 mode was used , taking into account that the two experiments have seen 24 events with @xmath70 gev@xmath71 , while the standard model expectation is @xmath72 events .",

    "no information was given to the fit on the invariant mass distribution of the anomalous hera events , in order to see if the preferred ( @xmath52,@xmath53 ) values were consistent with those required by the leptoquark interpretation of hera anomalous events .",
    "they turn out to be consistent , however @xmath60 is small in a narrow band over a wide range of masses .",
    "note that if the contour plot is performed using a too coarse - grained grid of points , this can be missed .",
    "one can at most say that for the @xmath38 leptoquark the preferred region is for @xmath73 gev , @xmath74 ( for a mass of 200 gev the preferred value of @xmath53 is 0.034 ) and for the @xmath44 leptoquark @xmath75 gev , @xmath76 ( for a mass of 200 gev the preferred value of @xmath53 is 0.017 ) .",
