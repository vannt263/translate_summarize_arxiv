    "metal - insulator transitions ( mit)@xcite in realistic systems are often considered in a one - particle picture to explain the change of conductivity in a material . in situations such as band , peierls and anderson insulators ,",
    "this yields a successful description , but in the case of mott insulators the electron - electron correlation gives rise to a contribution which is more important than the electron - ion interaction in the localization of the electronic wave function ( wf)@xcite . in this situations a proper description of the correlated wf becomes crucial , which can not be in general achieved through the first principle methods usually employed for periodic systems such as the density functional theory ( dft)@xcite . among the different wave function - based local approaches employed to overcome the dimensionality problem in correlated extended and periodic systems , the method of increments ( moi)@xcite has gained a particular attention in the last decade .",
    "this approach can be applied to any wave function method and as shown in the recent work by voloshina and paulus@xcite it successfully retrieves almost 100% of the correlation energy of bulk materials with large static correlation if applied in a multireference ( mr ) fashion .",
    "+ in our previous investigation@xcite we have exploited the quantum chemical version@xcite of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite approach to calculate the ground state energy of a model system , _ i.e. _ beryllium ring - shaped cluster , and explored the use of quantum information theory ( qit)@xcite to characterize the wave function and thus determine the metal - like and insulating - like character of a system in different regions of the potential energy surface ( pes ) .",
    "in the present paper we will focus again on the same system exploring the use of the method of increments ( moi ) for closed - shell systems obtaining whole ground state dissociation curves through a multireference approach that allows to describe the crossing region where single reference approaches such as ccsd(t)@xcite fail .",
    "dmrg calculations as described in our previous work will be used as reference for testing the moi approximation to the correlation energy .",
    "+ even though a model system is considered , we will underline how the use of standard canonical methods become prohibitive because of the high correlation effects involved especially if aiming to the thermodynamic limit . as we will show",
    "the moi formalism used in this work involves only localized orbitals ( los ) which allows it to use limited active space despite large systems are involved",
    ". we will exploit this tool to calculate the correlation energy of be@xmath0 rings as large as @xmath1 and extrapolate the behavior at the thermodynamic limit .",
    "+ this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : moi ] we describe the formalism of the method of increments for single- and multireference methods as applied in this work ; in section  [ sec : comp_det ] the problematics in describing the system with canonical wave function methods are underlined and we give the details of our calculations ; in section  [ sec : results ] we focus on th results obtained for the be@xmath2 ring in order to highlight the accuracy and the advantages of the multireference moi in comparison different methods ; we also report and compare the results obtained for larger rings and the behavior at the thermodynamic limit is extrapolated ; our conclusions are finally drawn in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the method of increments exploits the short range nature of the electronic correlation . within this approach localized orbitals",
    "are used in order to describe the correlation energy as sum of individual contributions coming from the correlation of different parts of the systems , to which we will refer as bodies . in its general formalism which employs single reference methods such as coupled cluster ( cc ) or perturbation theory",
    "approaches , only the occupied orbitals are localized and some of them together with the virtual canonical orbitals are used to build the correlation space .",
    "+ in the moi , one starts from a first approximation of the correlation energy , @xmath3 , which is given by the sum of all independent contributions @xmath4 each arising from the @xmath5 body : @xmath6 we refer to the individual terms @xmath4 as 1-body increments .",
    "the contribution expressed in eq .",
    "[ eq_1body ] ranges typically between 60% and 90% of the correlation energy achievable through the chosen correlation method .",
    "the remaining part of @xmath7 is enclosed in the higher order increments which consider the correlation among many bodies .",
    "the second natural step is then to include one more body and define the 2-body increments @xmath8 as : @xmath9 going forward to higher order increments we get similar expressions .",
    "for instance the 3-body increments are calculated using the expression : @xmath10 combining these contributions , one can finally express the correlation energy @xmath7 : @xmath11 as pointed out above , the electronic correlation is in general short ranged , and the @xmath12-interaction is a two - particle interaction which implies that the increments decrease with the distance and the order of the bodies , _",
    "i.e. _ if the following convergence criteria are fulfilled : @xmath13 @xmath14 this allows to truncate the expansion of eq .",
    "[ ecorr_sum ] , yielding a meaningful amount of the correlation energy .",
    "the local nature of the moi and the possibility of truncating eq .",
    "[ ecorr_sum ] are crucial points in making the method a candidate for the application to extended and periodic systems , for which canonical wave function methods are generally prohibitive .",
    "nevertheless the moi can not be universally applied and fails when the required convergences explicated in eq .",
    "[ conv1 ]  and  [ conv2 ] do not occur .",
    "moreover since the increments might have alternating sign , the moi is not a variational method .",
    "as recently shown by voloshina and paulus @xcite , a multireference moi approach can successfully be used to calculate the cohesive energy of bulk metals for systems with a high static correlation contribution . in comparison with the single reference formalism , a different localization pattern is required in this approach . indeed ,",
    "besides the occupied orbitals , also the virtual orbitals important for the evaluation of the static correlation have to be localized .",
    "this way one can then calculate incremental static contributions to @xmath7 arising from complete active space self consistent field ( cas - scf)@xcite calculations performed within the bodies constituted by occupied and virtual los . finally on top of the cas - scf wave function",
    ", a mr calculation is performed for each term of the incremental expansion , including the remaining delocalized virtual orbitals .",
    "the scheme is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : incre_scheme ] .",
    "the equations described in the previous section remain still valid are used to expand and truncate the correlation energy . as described in the following section we will employ a minimal basis set and localize all virtual orbitals which will be use to construct the complete active space .",
    "we will not perform any multireference calculation on top of the cas - scf wave functions and we will refer to the method as cas - moi .",
    "as subject of our investigation we have chosen a model system characterized by a high static correlation contribution , _ i.e. _  beryllium ring - shaped clusters , whose pseudo - onedimensional structure was chosen to resemble the periodic born - von - karman boundary conditions and to obtain a wf that will inevitably converge with size towards the thermodynamic limit of an infinite linear chain . because of the quasi degeneracy of valence 2@xmath15 and virtual 2@xmath16 orbitals ( more than 93% of the correlation energy of be atom in its @xmath17 ground state is static )",
    ", 4@xmath18 active orbitals would be required to obtain a size - consistent cas - scf reference for mr calculations for be@xmath0 .",
    "this leads to cas(2@xmath18 , 4@xmath18 ) calculations which become of course prohibitive as the number of be atoms increases .",
    "we report in fig .",
    "[ fig : be10_cas ] the dissociation curves of be@xmath19 calculated using a minimal atomic basis set and different active spaces within the cas - scf method . as one can see , despite the use of larger and larger active spaces gives a finer and finer description of the potential energy curves , the calculated dissociation plateaus lie at much higher energies than the dissociation limit calculated within the same method using an active space consisting of the 2@xmath15 and 2@xmath16 functions of the free atom .",
    "similar results are reported in more details in table  [ tab_ci ] as described later on .",
    "+ this model system is complicated further by the fact that the @xmath16 functions , besides enlarging the active space , play a big role at the hartree - fock level too .",
    "indeed , while at dissociation the hf orbitals will be linear combination of pure 2@xmath15 atomic orbitals , as the interatomic distance shortens their @xmath16-character increases and , at a certain geometry , the homo switches from a pure @xmath15 to a pure @xmath16 molecular orbital .",
    "in other words , we encounter a crossing between two hf configurations which dominate the ground state at different interactomic distances .",
    "this holds for the finite pseudo - onedimensional clusters indepentely from their size as well for the periodic chain given that both the energy and the character of the discrete hartree - fock molecular orbitals of be@xmath0 rings converge towards the crystal orbitals . in order to supplye a graphical representation of these hf wave functions",
    ", we report in fig .",
    "[ fig : configurations ] the band structure calculated in the two regimes and the @xmath15-character of the hartree - fock valence orbitals of a periodic beryllium chain close to the minimum of the dissociation curve ( blue line ) and towards dissociation ( red line ) .",
    "respectively , we will refer to these as configuration ( conf ) 1 and 2 and we will indicate the two regimes where each of them dominates as metal - like and insulator - like regime . clearly an accurate single reference method such as ccsd(t ) will work perfectly in the regimes where one of the configuration is dominant , but not around the crossing region .",
    "we will show how the size problem and the necessity for a mr approach will be overcome through the use of the multireference method of increments allowing us to describe the pes of be@xmath0 till dissociation .",
    "+ by unitary transformation of the canonical orbitals of the two main hf configurations different sets of los are obtained ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : configurations ] ) . indeed ,",
    "in the insulator - like regime localized orbitals resemble atomic 2@xmath15 and 2@xmath16 orbitals , while in the metallic regime @xmath20- and @xmath21-like orbitals appear .",
    "as we will show , the use of the different starting hartree - fock configuration has a huge impact on the effectiveness of the method , despite in both cases the result should converge toward the full - ci limit .",
    "the molpro quantum chemistry package@xcite was used to perform the different steps of moi calculations _",
    "hartree - fock calculations , foster - boys localization@xcite and cas - scf calculations .",
    "we employed a minimal basis set consisting of 1@xmath15 , 2@xmath15 and 2@xmath16 atomic functions derived by the dunning s @xmath22-pvdz@xcite .",
    "we kept the core 1@xmath15 orbitals frozen during the incremental calculations , focusing on the correlation of valence orbitals .",
    "the crystal09@xcite code was employed to calculate the hartree - fock wave function of the periodic chain using the same basis set .     at the complete active space self consistent field ( cas - scf ) level of theory , using different active spaces .",

    "notice that the character of the valence band ( full lines ) at the x - point of the brilluoin zone switches from pure @xmath16 to pure @xmath15 as sketched in the insets .",
    "the localized orbitals obtained by unitary transformation of the valence and virtual orbitals are also shown .",
    "as one can see , the difference in @xmath15-character is reflected by the different symmetry of the localized orbitals .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we start our analysis reporting the single reference ccsd(t ) results obtained for be@xmath2 using both the canonical formalism and the moi expansion , to illustrate how within the same quantum chemical method , this truncation works in retrieving the correlation energy .",
    "the method of increments at the 4-body level retrieves more than the 99.99% of the correlation energy achievable with the canonical ccsd(t ) if the proper hf starting configurations ( conf  1  and  2 ) are used in the two limiting regimes , while around the crossing this percentage drops to around 95% .",
    "also in this regime the @xmath23 diagnostic calculated within the canonical ccsd(t ) presents values larger than @xmath24 highlighting the necessity of using a multireference approach for describing the static correlation .",
    "however as already stated and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : be10_cas ] , canonical cas - scf approaches can not be used to calculate a size consistent wave function unless a cas(2@xmath18,4@xmath18 ) is performed , _",
    "i.e. _ a full - ci in our minimal basis set , and this is of course not applicable as @xmath18 increases .",
    "of course , a multireference calculation performed on top of an accurate cas or ras calculation would reach the required accuracy , but since it is our interest to explore the convergence toward the thermodynamic limit , it is clear that a local method is preferable .",
    "moreover , this choice in general reduce the problem of choosing a proper and consistent active space . + in fig .",
    "[ fig : pes_mr - moi ] we report the dissociation curve of be@xmath2 as obtained using the cas - moi at the 4-body level using the conf  1  and  2 . because in our case , the incremental scheme is converging towards the full - ci solution , it would be in principle equivalent to start from one or the other configuration .",
    "however as it can be seen , truncating the correlation energy at the 4-body level the two results match in a narrow regime only , _",
    "i.e. _ around the crossing , while for other internuclear distances a non - monotonic behavior is obtained if not the proper hf configuration is used .",
    "we want to focus now on the comparison with the dmrg data which were obtained in our previous investigation@xcite and we use fixed @xmath25 block states results as a reference to evaluate the behavior of the cas - moi and the other methods discussed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_dmrg ] we report the absolute error with respect to the dmrg data of the above described cas - moi , canonical ccsd(t ) and the very accurate multiconfigurational calculation , ras(4,24 ) . as it can be seen",
    "the cas - moi gives the best results for almost any interatomic distance , and while the other approaches depart too much from the dmrg reference around the crossing , the cas - moi results stay within an error of @xmath26 on the total energy .",
    "moreover since the increments are all negative and converging ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : incre_percent ] ) we might argue that the moi is behaving variationally in our calculations . as a consequence , if this is the case , the method of increments is actually retrieving more correlation energy than dmrg ( as one can see the error is negative in a quite wide regime ) . only in the metal - like regime",
    "this approach gives worse results with respect to the other reported even if it underestimate the module of @xmath7 only by @xmath27 with respect to ras(4,24 ) ) .",
    "this can be explained considering the high delocalization of the wave function in this regime which is hard to describe with a local approach .",
    "a quantitative comparison between the results with cas - moi , dmrg , ccsd(t ) and different cas and ras methods is reported in table  [ tab_ci ] .",
    "again one can realize the difficulty in retrieving a meaningful amount of the correlation energy with canonical methods and how in general the local approach gives reasonable results with relatively less effort .",
    "+ let us now consider the strong deviations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pes_mr - moi ] ( dashed lines ) that occur when the cas - moi is employed starting from a hf configuration which is not the dominant one . in order to explain why in this situation the method fails in describing the electronic structure of the system ,",
    "let us analyze the behavior of the individual increments as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : incre_percent ] .",
    "what can be observed is that , as we overcome the crossing , the required convergence stated in eq .",
    "[ conv1 ]  and  [ conv2 ] break down and higher order increments give comparable contributions to @xmath7 as lower order ones .",
    "this is equivalent to say that in the employed orbital basis ( _ i.e _ hf configuration ) , higher order contributions become more and more important which is analogous to what was concluded from the analysis of the mutual information as described in our dmrg analysis@xcite that showed the increase of long range entanglement .",
    "this strong dependence on the starting configuration is of course a great disadvantage of the moi which can otherwise yield accurate results with relatively cheap calculations .",
    "+ since we are forced to calculate both configurations , it might appear that no particular advantage arises from the use the cas - moi with respect to the single reference approach . on account of this , in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff_conf1_conf2 ] we report the differences between the energies obtained from conf  1 and conf  2 in the crossing regime for both methods .",
    "as it can be seen , in the case of cas - moi this difference is around @xmath28 smaller than ccsd(t ) and ranges between @xmath29 .",
    "this means that in this narrow regime , the two bases give us comparable results leading to a smooth curve , which is not the case for ccsd(t ) . in account of this and",
    "previous statements , we can conclude that the cas - moi allows to describe the behavior of the pes also in the crossing regime allowing us to describe the whole dissociation curve .",
    "+ we conclude this section comparing the individual increments as obtained from ccsd(t ) and cas - scf ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : incre_percent ] and table  [ tab_incre ] ) . for the former method , the lower order increments are larger than for cas - moi because a larger active space is involved , but at the 3- and 4-body level the orbital optimization which retrieves the static correlation starts playing a bigger role than the size of active space . in general the single reference method",
