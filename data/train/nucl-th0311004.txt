    "the experimental facilities ( such as those at jefferson laboratory ) put into operation for the last decade have opened new horizons in studying the structure of nucleons and nuclei .",

    "the description of the transverse cross section as well as our results for the kinematics  @xcite could be improved by taking into account the @xmath106 resonance contribution to the amplitude , which would affect the transverse component of the pion production operator with practically no changes on the longitudinal one .    when calculating the differential cross sections for the deuteron , we made use of the parametrizations  @xcite for the @xmath108- and @xmath109-components of the deuteron wave function .",

    ", we applied these approaches to reproduce mainz data  @xcite on @xmath80 meson photoproduction from the deuteron at small energies @xmath112 of the residual nn system ( see fig .",
    "it is seen that both the approaches give results in reasonable agreement with the experiment .",
    "it turns out also that the ia curve practically coincides with the calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the plots of the @xmath1)nn cross section obtained for the kinematics of the saclay experiment  @xcite are displayed in fig .  [ 6 ] .",
    "the cross section is presented as a function of the `` missing '' mass @xmath113 ( invariant mass of the nn pair ) .",
    "the shown results suggest that , contrary to the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite , the nn fsi leads to some increase    of the @xmath80 production rate within the pion energy range covered in the experiment .",
    "indeed , the ratio @xmath66 ( see eq .",
    "( 15 ) ) calculated in the plane - wave ia is 0.74 , whereas the corresponding value given by the ia with the @xmath110 nn fsi included turns out to be 0.79 .",
    "it is seen also that the result obtained using the unitary transformation method in conjunction with the extension of the siegert theorem does not much differ from the one provided by the ia indicating a weak sensitivity of the @xmath1)nn differential cross section to the two - body contributions for the kinematics of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath114 was derived being in agreement with the measured quantity ( 15 ) .",
    "thus , our calculations suggest that the main source of the @xmath80 meson yield quenching observed in the experiment  @xcite in case of the deuteron target originates from nuclear medium effects influencing the @xmath80 production process .",
    "these effects include nucleon fermi motion and binding along with pauli blocking of the final nn state .",
    "the fermi - motion and binding effects are involved in the one - body pion production operator as well as in the phase - space factor arising due to the energy - momentum conservation law , when performing integration in eq .  ( 18 ) .",
    "the binding effects in the operator emerge as an off - shell behavior of the one - body amplitude .",
    "their importance in description of exclusive pion production off the deuteron was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the corresponding contribution to the @xmath1)nn cross section for the kinematics of ref .",
    "@xcite appears to be not significant .",
    "the other factors of nuclear medium influence mentioned above prove to be important and result in the overall pion production rate reduction by more than 20% .",
    "in particular , it turns out that the pauli suppression in the final two - neutron state reduces the ratio ( 15 ) by about the same value , as the nn fsi increases it .",
    "the role of this effect is also illustrated by fig .  [ 7 ] , where the contributions due to the singlet and triplet final nn states to the differential cross section calculated within the plane - wave ia are displayed .",
    "it is seen that the pauli antisymmetrization of the two - nucleon wave function strongly suppresses the triplet contribution in the region of small relative momenta of the outgoing neutrons .",
    "it should be noted also that the incompleteness of the pion energy range coverage in the integral of eq .",
    "( 15 ) also contributes to reduction of the ratio given by that formula .    for a quasiparallel kinematics and a relatively small momentum transferred to the hadronic system ( as it takes place in the experiment  @xcite ) , the transverse components @xmath115}$ ] of the pion production operator are dominated by the spin - flip kroll - ruderman contribution  @xcite , whereas the `` longitudinal '' virtual photons couple mostly to a term proportional to the component @xmath116 of the pauli spin matrix @xmath117 giving no rise to spin - flip transitions .",
    "therefore , the singlet nn final state contribution , e.g. , in the purely transverse sf s @xmath118 and @xmath119 results mainly from the deuteron states with spin projections @xmath120 , while the longitudinal hadronic response in the @xmath110 nn fsi peak region is determined by the @xmath121 deuteron state .",
    "this consideration complies with the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite indicating a strong @xmath80 production rate dependence on the deuteron spin orientation in the vicinity of the @xmath110 peak which , in principle , could be observed experimentally with a polarized deuteron target .",
    "as pointed out in paper  @xcite , this result is predetermined by the angular momentum conservation law in the reaction in case of an exactly parallel kinematics .",
    "we see , that the spin correlations discussed here should take place also for moderate deviations from the parallel geometry . however , they might be veiled then by the pion fsi and by extra terms in the pion production operator for kinematics probing high - momentum components of the deuteron wave function .",
    "when comparing our numerical results with experiment  @xcite , it should be kept in mind that the data plotted in fig .",
    "[ 6 ] have not been corrected for radiative processes .",
    "introduction of such corrections could shift the experimental points by several mev towards lower missing masses making the agreement with our calculations more fair .",
    "radiation broadening along with finite spectrometer resolution might also be the reason of the fact that the fsi peak was not clearly resolved in the experiment .",
    "recent measurements of cross sections of forward - angle @xmath80 electroproduction on the lightest nuclei with the physics motivation similar to that of paper  @xcite have been carried out in jefferson lab experiment e91003  @xcite . our calculations for the @xmath1)nn reaction at one of the e91003 kinematical sets ( @xmath122 = -0.4 ( gev / c)@xmath4 , @xmath68=1160 mev , @xmath69=845 mev , and @xmath123= 450 mev ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ 8 ] . near the quasi - free peak",
    ", our approach leads to the results almost indistinguishable from the ones given by the ia .",
    "however , we observe an appreciable discrepancy for lower missing masses ( greater pion energies ) that reaches 20 % in the @xmath110 nn fsi peak region . in general , the results of calculations are in a satisfactory agreement with the experiment , though in the vicinity of the quasi - free peak , the curves are about 15 % above the data .",
    "it could be explained by a more considerable relative contribution of the transverse sf @xmath118 to the cross section for the selected kinematics compared to kinematics of ref .",
    "( the ratio @xmath124 [ see eq .",
    "( 16 ) ] is equal to 1.7 and 1.4 , respectively ) .",
    "since this sf is sensitive to the @xmath125 resonance production mechanism neglected in the present calculations , it could result in some overestimate of the cross section ( cf .",
    "[ 4 ] ) . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , for kinematics tuned to the @xmath125 resonance , a considerable cancellation occurs between the resonance contributions to the one - body amplitude and the pion rescattering terms .",
    "however , for the considered above kinematic conditions which are away from the @xmath125 peak for the system of the virtual photon and the proton , the @xmath125 contribution to the cross section can be still significant through the interference with the nonresonance terms displayed in fig .  [ 3 ] .",
    "so , to make a more definite conclusion about the true role of the @xmath125 resonance production , a thorough study of fsi including 3-body dynamics is needed ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "we would like to note also that the choice of kinematics for experiments  @xcite was predetermined by their physics motivation with a hope to have the cross sections strongly dominated by the pion - pole pion production mechanism .",
    "it turns out , however , that other processes shown in fig .  [ 3 ] also play an essential role , in particular , via their interference with the pion - pole diagram . in this connection ,",
    "our calculations confirm the conclusions of refs .",
    "the approach based on the unitary transformation method has been applied to the treatment of pion electroproduction on the deuteron near threshold . to provide the gi of the results , we have used the expression for the amplitude stemming from the extension of the siegert theorem . within the approach ,",
    "the differential cross section of the @xmath1)nn reaction for the kinematics of the saclay experiment has been calculated and compared with that given by the ia .",
    "the results suggest that the observed suppression of the @xmath80 meson production rate in the @xmath1)nn reaction compared to the case of pion electroproduction on the proton can be due to such effects as nucleon fermi motion and binding .",
    "calculations performed for the kinematics of jefferson lab experiment e91003 also manifest a satisfactory agreement with the data .",
    "further improvement of the model ( in particular , its extension to the @xmath106 resonance region ) can be achieved by taking into account the fsi of the pion with the nn system .",
