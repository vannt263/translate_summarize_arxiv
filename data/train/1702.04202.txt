    "our calculations indicate that conditions for the development of magnetic instabilities on the core - localized q1d defect states can be tuned by tensile uniaxial strains , along the defect direction , at both limits of isolated and interacting 558 defects . a tensile strain along the defect axis , which we refer to as a parallel strain , leads to two cooperative effects that favor the emergence of itinerant ferromagnetic in the 558-defect states : ( i ) enhancement of the dos of the q1d states in the region of the fermi level and ( ii ) tuning of the fermi level to the maximum of the related dos peak .    on the other hand , an uniaxial tensile strain in the direction perpendicular to the defect line ( perpendicular strain ) is shown to be detrimental to the development of magnetic states on the 558 defect , because in this case ,",

    "it was shown that , in the isolated - defect limit , tuning the fermi level with @xmath2-type doping is required for the ferromagnetic instability to set in , which means that the sc is not met for an isolated 558 defect in a neutral and unstrained graphene layer .",

    "the mechanisms behind these trends , and also behind the behavior of the anomalous case of defects at a distance of @xmath0 , can be understood from the perspective of the stoner criterion .",

    ", we show @xmath27 for the unstrained state , and for the cases of 4% and 10% parallel strain .    starting from the anomalous @xmath0  case in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , we observe that application of a tensile strain does not enhance the defect - related peak in the dos near the fermi level .",
    "this indicates that strain does not enhance the localization of the defect electronic states at the fermi level , and its only effect in this case is a better tuning of the fermi level , that shifts closer to the maximum of the dos peak in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) .",
    "this explains why , at this defect - defect distance , the 558 defect only develops a magnetic moment for strains above 5% .",
    "thus , the only factor in eq .  [ eq1 ] that is affected by application of a tensile parallel strain in this case is the value of the dos at the fermi level , @xmath28 , and the exchange integral remains essentially unchanged .      at larger distances",
    "this picture changes , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5](b)-(f ) where we observe that a parallel tensile strain induces two effects in the electronic structure of the 558 defect .",
    "the first one is a better tuning of the fermi level , that shifts closer to the peak of defect states in the dos , as in the @xmath11  case , but we also observe an enhancement of the height of the dos peak , connected with a stronger localization of the electronic states of the 558 defect in the fermi level region .",
    "note that at the two largest distances in our study ( @xmath9  and @xmath29 ) , the evolution of the dos and also of the fermi level position with strain is more complex due to the presence of two dos peaks of defect states near the fermi level in the unstrained state , that merge into a single peak at larger strains .",
    "regarding the anomalous @xmath0  case , we speculate that when 558 defects are separated by a distance @xmath0 , the lack of a bulk region ( as shown in the inset in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) onto which the defect - related electronic states can relax , inhibits the enhancement of the localization of the defect states induced by the parallel strain , that we observe at larger distances where the defects are surrounded by bulk material .    the parallel - strain induced enhancement of localization , hence of the exchange integrals in eq .",

    "[ fig6 ] , we show the band structures for the unstrained and 10% parallel - strained cases , for three different values of @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig6](a ) shows the @xmath30  case , where extended van hove singularities do not appear in the band structure of the unstrained defect . at this defect - defect distance , even for the 10%-strained case in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) we observe no extended van hove singularities in the band strucuture , and the only effect of strain is the tuning of the fermi level , as discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "this explains why for @xmath30  the system develops only a moderate value of @xmath21 , even for such large value of strain , and generally the behavior of @xmath21 with strain does not follows the trends we observe at larger defect - defect distances .",
    "when 558 defects are separated by @xmath6 , extended van hove singularities , connected to the large flat portions of the defects bands at the fermi level , appear in the band structure for the unstrained defect , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) .",
    "this observation , along with the fact that the fermi level in this case is very near the maximum of the dos peak , are the reasons behind the development of a large value of @xmath21 already for the unstrained defects in this case . for the strained states , a better tuning of the fermi level to the maximum of the resonant defect peak in the dos [ shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ] , coupled with an enhancement of the extended van hove singularities , due to an elargement of the flat portions of the bands at the fermi level , and a reduction of the band widths of the defect bands , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig6](d ) , explain the increase of @xmath21 with increasing strain displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "strain plays an even more decisive role in the limit of non - interacting defects ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "as indicated above , the unstrained defect shows a borderline behavior , with a very small value of @xmath21 .",
    "given the presence of quite wide van hove singularities in the band structure of the unstrained defect , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig6](c ) , it is to be expected that tensile strains in this case should drive the system towards a more robust magnetic state .",
    "indeed , for a critical parallel tensile strain between 1% and 2% the system develops a sizeable value of @xmath31 .",
    "further increase in the value of @xmath21 for larger strains is explained along the same reasoning as the @xmath6  case , i.e. , better tuning of the fermi level and an enhancement of the flat portions of the defect bands that leads to more localized states and enhanced exchange effects . for this non - interacting case ,",

    "[ fig8](a ) is that a tensile perpendicular of up to 5% enhances the peak related to the defect states in the dos , i.e. , a perpendicular strain may actually enhance the localization and thus the exchange integral of the defect states .",

    "note that the height of the defect peak in @xmath35 , at 2% perpendicular strain , is greater than that of the unstrained defect , while the value of @xmath21 decreases in fig .",

    "<S> the combined effects of defect - defect interaction and of uniaxial or biaxial strains of up to 10% on the development of magnetic states on the defect - core - localized quasi - one - dimensional electronic states generated by the so - called 558 linear extended defect in graphene monolayers are investigated by means of _ ab initio _ calculations . </S>",
    "<S> results are analyzed on the basis of the heuristics of the stoner criterion . </S>",
    "<S> we find that conditions for the emergence of magnetic states on the 558 defect can be tuned by uniaxial tensile parallel strains ( along the defect direction ) at both limits of isolated and interacting 558 defects . </S>",
    "<S> parallel strains are shown to lead to two cooperative effects that favor the emergence of itinerant magnetism : enhancement of the dos of the resonant defect states in the region of the fermi level and tuning of the fermi level to the maximum of the related dos peak . </S>",
    "<S> a perpendicular strain is likewise shown to enhance the dos of the defect states , but it also effects a detunig of the fermi level that shifts away from the maximum of the dos of the defect states , which inhibts the emergence of magnetic states . as a result , under biaxial strains </S>",
    "<S> the stabilization of a magnetic state depends on the relative magnitudes of the two components of strain . </S>"
