    "fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) is the phenomenon where interacting electrons form many - body liquid phases in two spatial dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the best understood ( and experimentally the most robust ) of all such states is the @xmath1 laughlin state  @xcite .",
    "phases in the fqhe display many interesting properties related to topological order  @xcite and fractionalization , for instance , their fundamental excitations carry fractional electric charges  @xcite and obey the fractional statistics when they are braided around one another  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental fqhe physics results from the combined effect of coulomb interaction between electrons , and the landau level quantization in strong magnetic fields that completely suppresses the kinetic energy of the electrons ( for an introduction to fqhe physics see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a traditional method that has played an important role in understanding many fqh states has been the formulation of first - quantized many - body wave functions for the ground states of the system at various filling fractions .",
    "this approach was pioneered by laughlin @xcite who proposed one such class of wave functions for the filling fractions @xmath2 , @xmath3 . in order to write down these wave functions ,",
    "it is customary to assume that a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) that hosts the fqhe can be viewed as a continuum system in the infinite plane .",
    "historically , this has lead to an additional assumption that the 2deg is also rotationally invariant around the axis perpendicular to the plane of the 2deg . under these assumptions ,",
    "the laughlin wave function becomes a jastrow polynomial that involves the products of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the complex 2d electron coordinate [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : laughlin ] ) below for an explicit form of the wave function ] .",
    "because of rotational invariance , @xmath5 is fixed to be @xmath6 ( sign depending on the direction of the magnetic field ) .",
    "this type of wave functions has been microscopically very successful in modelling the exact ground state of the system computed numerically by diagonalizing the coulomb interaction hamiltonian .",
    "however , as variational wave functions , the laughlin states are rather unusual because they lack any optimizing parameters .",
    "although this surprising feature of the laughlin states has been noted a long time ago , it is only very recently  @xcite been appreciated that the laughlin wave functions do indeed contain a variational parameter . in order to expose this parameter",
    ", one must lift the assumption of the rotational invariance of the system .    .",
    "each droplet contains one electron in the center of an area corresponding to three magnetic flux quanta .",
    "( a ) the isotropic ( rotationally symmetric ) laughlin state where the droplets are circles .",
    "( b ) laughlin state with a more general , spatially dependent metric where the droplets become elliptical . ]    because the laughlin 1/3 state describes a gapped topological phase , i.e. , a liquid which is robust to any local perturbations that do not close the gap of the system , its existence is not sensitive to the geometric details of the system .",
    "the basic physics of the laughlin state is that it efficiently places electrons apart from one another , yet avoids breaking the translational symmetry in doing so .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , we can thus characterize the laughlin state in terms of fundamental droplets which are schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : laughlindroplets ] .",
    "each droplet contains one electron in an area corresponding to 3 magnetic flux quanta ( in general , for more complicated states at fillings @xmath7 , a droplet would contain @xmath8 orbitals inhabited by @xmath9 electrons ) . when the system is rotationally isotropic , the shape of the droplet is circular .",
    "however , in a more general setting [ fig .",
    "[ fig : laughlindroplets](b ) ] the metric may be spatially dependent .",
    "for example , the 2deg may be wrapped around a curved surface , the direction of the magnetic field may be slightly tilted at various points in space , etc . in these circumstances , it is natural to expect that the shape of the fundamental droplets will also vary depending on the location of their center .",
    "therefore , the shape of the droplets is a hidden variational parameter that characterizes the laughlin state and this parameter can be tuned to yield the best variational description of the actual ground state of the system .",
    "our cartoon of the fundamental droplets of the laughlin state can be formalized into a phenomenological picture of the fqhe as a fluid of particle - flux composites with finite area .",
    "these composite particles are known as  composite bosons \"  @xcite or  composite fermions \"  @xcite , depending on how many orbitals surround an electron . in general , the composites carry information about numbers @xmath9 and @xmath8 that define the filling fraction @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the occupancy pattern inside the droplet is also connected to the concept of  topological spin \" ( which is also related to the  shift \"  @xcite when the quantum hall state is placed on a sphere ) .",
    "the finite area of the droplet means that a metric [ that of the guiding center defined below ] is required to specify the shape .",
    "in addition to the shape , the guiding center metric is also related to the spin .",
    "the deformation of the shape of the composite particle couples to spin , thus connecting topology and geometry .",
    "the fluctuations of the quantum metric and its coupling to spin gives rise to dynamics in the fqhe phases .",
    "more precisely , in the full problem of a 2deg in the magnetic field , one encounters , in fact , two distinct metrics . this can be seen as follows .",
    "the phase space for each particle confined to two dimensions in a transverse magnetic field consists of two sets of non - commuting real - space coordinates .",
    "the position of an electron can be separated into the cyclotron and the guiding center coordinates respectively as @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the cyclotron coordinates are related to the canonical momenta by @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the two - dimensional levi - civita symbol , and @xmath14 is the magnetic length .",
    "the commutation relations @xmath15=-i\\ell_b^2\\epsilon^{ab}$ ] and @xmath16=i\\ell_b^2\\epsilon^{ab}$ ] hold .",
    "these are independent hilbert spaces , in each of which the real - space coordinates do not commute with each other , leading to quantum fluctuations of the metric of each .",
    "the cyclotron coordinates are present in the term for kinetic energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the guiding center coordinates are present in the interaction term .",
    "one way to characterize the difference between integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe )  @xcite and fqhe is by the part of the hilbert space in which the relevant dynamics takes place . for iqhe ,",
    "the guiding center degrees of freedom are frozen because the lls are fully filled , and the dynamics is governed by cyclotron coordinates . for fqhe , it is the opposite : the cyclotron degree of freedom is frozen by the strong magnetic field , and the dynamics is governed by the guiding center coordinates .",
    "the fluctuations of the guiding center metric give rise to phenomena such as the fqhe bulk neutral excitations in long wavelength limit @xcite .",
    "the guiding - center metric is also related to the hall viscosity @xcite .",
    "recently , anisotropy and geometry in fqhe systems have received much attention .",
    "several papers have studied fqhe systems in curved spaces @xcite .",
    "transport coefficients have been calculated as a response to variations of spatial geometry @xcite .",
    "anisotropic metric has been connected to the band structure of materials giving rise to the fqhe @xcite , the tilting of the magnetic field @xcite and the so - called nematic phases in higher landau levels @xcite .",
    "anisotropic mass has been shown to affect the shape of the composite fermion surface @xcite . in experiment ,",
    "the anisotropy of the fermi contour has been studied in gaas quantum wells using an l - shaped hall bar and periodic strain engineered using a grating of electron - beam resist @xcite .",
    "finally , there are recent proposals for experimental implementations of time - dependent external metric via acoustic crystalline waves  @xcite .    in this paper , we study the geometric degree of freedom that characterizes the shape of the fundamental droplets of the laughlin @xmath1 state .",
    "we design several numerical experiments and probes that can be used to detect the fluctuations of this degree of freedom of fqhe states . for most of the calculations ,",
    "we use the geometry of an open cylinder where the metric perturbation can be conveniently introduced , but our results are sufficiently general that they apply to any geometry .",
    "one advantage of the cylinder geometry is that all the single - particle orbitals in momentum - space have the same shape , unlike the disk or the sphere .",
    "therefore , spatially - varying properties can be studied without interference from other geometrical effects . in section [ sec : cyl ] , we provide a self - contained review of the quantum hall problem in the cylinder geometry . in section [ sec : coh ] we introduce the generalization of coherent states in the spirit of the fundamental droplets sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : laughlindroplets ] .",
    "we show that such generalized coherent states can be used to formulate an  off - diagonal long range order \" ( odlro ) parameter that is quantized at long distances for the laughlin state at @xmath1 , but vanishes for a compressible state at the same filling factor .",
    "we also study the squeezing of coherent states in the vicinity of an edge of the cylinder . in section",
    "[ sec : response ] we spatially perturb the metric in a controlled and smooth way , and study the response of the fqh fluid . in agreement with analytical expectations ,",
    "we find the response to be proportional to the gaussian curvature of the perturbed metric . in section  [ sec :",
    "pair ] we introduce a different operator  the  pair amplitude \" operator  and use it to measure the intrinsic geometry fluctuations of the laughlin state when the mass tensor is anisotropic or the system is perturbed by an electric field gradient .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we consider a 2deg confined to the surface of a finite cylinder with radial magnetic field .",
    "we set the @xmath17-axis to be along the axis of the cylinder and @xmath18-axis to be the periodic direction .",
    "this is equivalent to working in the landau gauge with vector potential @xmath19 .",
    "the momentum along the @xmath18-direction , @xmath20 , is a good quantum number .",
    "the single particle wave functions (  orbitals \" ) have the form  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the magnetic length , @xmath23 is the hermite polynomial and @xmath24 labels the landau levels . in the following ,",
    "we restrict to the lowest landau level ( lll ) corresponding to @xmath25 .",
    "the allowed values of @xmath20 are @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the circumference of the cylinder and @xmath28 is an integer that resolves the degeneracy within the lll .",
    "we use a finite number of orbitals @xmath29 , which implies that the size of the system along the @xmath17-direction is approximately @xmath30 . in the lll , the wave function @xmath31 is then the product of a gaussian along the @xmath17-axis localized at @xmath32 and a plane wave along the @xmath18-axis .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is set by the filling factor but also by the nature of the given state , due to the topological quantum number known as the  shift \"  @xcite .",
    "for example , for the @xmath1 laughlin state , @xmath33 gives the correct ground state .",
    "note that the shift can be determined from the occupancy pattern of the fundamental droplet , which according to fig .",
    "[ fig : laughlindroplets ] is @xmath34 for the laughlin state .    the two relevant length scales at this stage are the magnetic length @xmath35 , which sets the width of the wave function , and @xmath27 , the circumference of the cylinder which controls the distance and hence the overlap between the single - particle wave functions . henceforth , we set @xmath36 .",
    "we are interested in solving for the ground state and possibly a few low - lying excited states of a system of @xmath37 interacting electrons .",
    "this must be done numerically , and we resort to two techniques : exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) .",
    "exact diagonalization is an unbiased method of finding the eigenstates of the many - body hamiltonian , but limited to small systems because of the exponential increase in size of the hilbert space .",
    "dmrg  @xcite is a variational optimization over a class of  weakly - entangled \" states known as  matrix product states \"  @xcite . in the past",
    ", dmrg has been applied to fqh systems in various geometries  @xcite , but the convergence of the method was found to be the best for the cylinder geometry @xcite .",
    "a useful point of departure for the study of fqhe phases are the ground states of model hamiltonians that have high overlap with the ground state of the coulomb interaction .",
    "for example , at @xmath1 , it can be shown that the ground state for @xmath38 electrons interacting via coulomb repulsion has @xmath39 overlap with the ground state of the following hamiltonian : @xmath40 note that this hamiltonian is singular ; however , once its matrix elements are evaluated between the single - particle wave functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : single ] ) , all divergences are automatically removed .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath41 , which is better known as the @xmath42 haldane pseudopotential @xcite , is given by the first laguerre polynomial .    the ground state of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_laughlin ] ) can be analytically shown to have exactly zero energy @xcite . in the infinite plane",
    ", the wave function of this ground state is the laughlin state , @xmath43 where @xmath44 denote complex coordinates of electrons in the 2d plane .",
    "traditionally , one would write @xmath45 , but note that this parametrization is only valid for a rotationally invariant system such that the contour of constant @xmath46 is the circle .",
    "more generally , @xmath47 is also a valid choice , which for @xmath48 gives an elliptical contour of @xmath46 .",
    "the wave function @xmath49 is believed to represent all fundamental aspects of the physics of an actual @xmath1 state , even though the wave function of the physical system is far more complicated than eq .",
    "( [ eq : laughlin ] ) .",
    "the reason is that @xmath49 can be adiabatically connected to the ground state of the system with coulomb interaction without closing the excitation gap @xcite .",
    "many finite - size studies focus only on model interactions such as the one above , which is reasonable since these ground states typically have high overlap with the physical ground state and in particular share the same topological properties .",
    "however , in order to account for all the details of the physical ground state , one needs to directly model the coulomb interaction and its ground state separately . on a cylinder",
    ", the coulomb interaction has to be implemented with care because of the infinities that arise from its long range nature .",
    "we next discuss this point in some detail .",
    ", between the laughlin wave function and the ground state of coulomb interaction as a function of confinement strength for @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 electrons in @xmath33 orbitals.,width=4 ]    the fourier transform of the rotationally - invariant coulomb interaction in two - dimensions is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , it can be written as @xmath55 the integral in eq .",
    "[ eq : vr ] diverges at @xmath56 .",
    "since there is no periodicity along the @xmath17-axis , the @xmath57 integral can not be converted into a sum , in which case the singularity could be removed simply by ignoring the problematic term in the sum which has both @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "instead , we use the following strategy that works in the continuum limit .    in the second quantized notation",

    "the singularity appears when both @xmath65 and @xmath57 become zero . at @xmath66",
    ", the interaction can be separated into a singular and non - singular part : @xmath67 since the singular part is independent of all @xmath68 , we can discard it without affecting the eigenstates of the coulomb hamiltonian .",
    "however , doing this means that we are subtracting an arbitrary term from the energies of the eigenstates .",
    "therefore , the ground state energy can not be compared to that obtained from other geometries .",
    "another subtlety is that in order to model long - range interactions in an open system , we need a confining potential .",
    "this is because long - range interactions have a tendency to pile up the electrons near the edges , which can easily destroy the liquid ground state like the laughlin state . for the model interaction @xmath41 which is of ultrashort range ,",
    "no confinement is required .",
    "however , long range interactions such as the coulomb do require a confining potential along the axis of the cylinder . in the absence of such confinement",
    ", electrons would lower their energy by moving symmetrically to the edges of the system , leading to reconstructed edges @xcite , similar to the behavior on the disk geometry .",
    "we compared several confinement schemes in detail , including a simple parabolic confinement , hartree - type confinement ( in which the finite cylinder is considered to be embedded in an infinite one and the external uniform charge provides an effective confinement ) , and a co - axial sheet of charge . from these , we chose a simple parabolic one : @xmath69 which is the easiest to implement , yet sufficient to stabilize the fqh state depending on the value of @xmath70 . typically , finding the appropriate @xmath70 to get the correct ground state will require some fine tuning .",
    "one way to check that the coulomb ground state , @xmath71 , at @xmath1 is in the right phase is to calculate its overlap with the laughlin wave function , @xmath72 . using the simple parabolic potential ,",
    "we can obtain overlaps @xmath73 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : overlaps ] .",
    "the overlap is high only in the narrow range of the confining potential , indicating that the confinement has to be finely tuned to obtain the desired fqhe ground state .     and @xmath74 hierarchy states as a function of confinement .",

    "imagine that we are in the thermodynamic limit when the cylinder is very long , but the density of electrons is just right to be in the @xmath1 ground state .",
    "once we start increasing the magnitude of the confining potential , the @xmath1 state will display some rigidity to the perturbation because it is an incompressible fluid with a finite gap for all excitations .",
    "for sufficiently strong confinement , the ground state will become too squeezed and can no longer support the incompressible state . at this point , the state is gapless . upon even further squeezing ,",
    "the system will make a transition to a new gapped state which can be viewed as the condensate of the quasiparticles of the 1/3 state , i.e. the @xmath78 hierarchy state .",

    ", the system will ultimately transition to the @xmath88 quantum hall state in the middle of the cylinder .",
    "larger systems would naturally have the ability to display more gapped fractional states as a function of confinement before this final integer quantum hall state is achieved .",
    "apart from the confinement potential , the circumference of the cylinder @xmath27 is another tunable parameter .",

    "we mean that the mass anisotropy appears in the form factor resulting from single - particle wave functions , but the interaction fourier transform , @xmath206 , remains isotropic [ similar to refs .",

    "our calculations have been implemented in the cylinder geometry , but they are sufficiently general and directly apply to incompressible states at other filling fractions and with other types of boundary conditions ( for example , disk or torus ) .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the fundamental role of quantum geometry in fqhe has been the subject of several recent theoretical papers @xcite",
    ". moreover , recent experiments on gaas quantum wells @xcite have measured the anisotropy of the fermi contour in the case of the compressible @xmath209 state . in these experiments ,",
