    "-input multiple - output ( mimo ) techniques offer transmit diversity and high data rates through the use of multiple antennas at both transmitter and receiver sides @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a key component of a mimo system is the mimo detector at the receiver , which , in practice , is often the bottleneck for the overall performance and complexity .",
    "mimo detectors including sphere decoder and several of its variants @xcite-@xcite achieve near maximum likelihood ( ml ) performance at the cost of high complexity .",
    "other well known detectors including zf ( zero forcing ) , mmse ( minimum mean square error ) , and zf - sic ( zf with successive interference cancellation ) detectors @xcite,@xcite are attractive from a complexity view point , but achieve relatively poor performance .",
    "for example , the zf - sic detector ( i.e. , the well known v - blast detector with ordering @xcite,@xcite ) does not achieve the full diversity in the system . the mmse - sic detector has been shown to achieve optimal performance @xcite . however , these detectors are prohibitively complex for large number of antennas of the order of tens to hundreds . with small number of antennas , the high capacity potential of mimo",
    "is not fully exploited . a key issue with using large number of antennas , however , is the high detection complexities involved .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on large mimo systems , where by ` _ large _ '",
    "we mean number of transmit and receive antennas of the order of tens to hundreds .",
    "such large mimo systems will be of immense interest because of the very high spectral efficiencies possible in such systems .",
    "for example , in a v - blast system , increased number of transmit antennas means increased data rate without bandwidth increase . however , major bottlenecks in realizing such large mimo systems include @xmath4 physical placement of large number of antennas in communication terminals , @xmath5 lack of practical low - complexity detectors for such large systems , and @xmath6 channel estimation issues . in this paper",
    ", we address the second problem in the above ( i.e. , low - complexity large mimo detection ) . specifically , we present a low - complexity detector for large mimo systems , including v - blast as well as high - rate non - orthogonal space - time block codes ( stbc ) @xcite .",
    "the proposed low - complexity detector has its roots in past work on hopfield neural network ( hnn ) based algorithms for image restoration @xcite,@xcite , which are meant to handle large digital images .",
    "hnn based image restoration algorithms in @xcite are applied to multiuser detection ( mud ) in cdma systems on awgn channels in @xcite .",
    "this detector , referred to as the likelihood ascent search ( las ) detector , essentially searches out a sequence of bit vectors with monotonic likelihood ascent and converges to a fixed point in finite number of steps @xcite .",
    "the power of the las detector for cdma lies in @xmath4 its linear average per - bit complexity in number of users , and @xmath5 its ability to perform very close to ml detector for large number of users . taking the cue from las detector s complexity and performance superiority in large systems , we , in this paper ,",
    "successfully adopt the las detector for large mimo systems and report interesting results .",
    "we refer to the proposed detector as mf / zf / mmse - las detector depending on the initial vector used in the algorithm ; mf - las detector uses the matched filter output as the initial vector , and zf - las and mmse - las detectors employ zf and mmse outputs , respectively , as the initial vector .",
    "our major findings in this paper are summarized as follows :    * in an uncoded v - blast system with bpsk , the proposed detector achieves _ near - exponential diversity _ for hundreds of antennas ( i.e. , achieves near siso awgn performance ) .",
    "for example , the proposed detector nearly renders a @xmath7 mimo fading channel into 200 parallel , non - interfering siso awgn channels .",
    "the detector achieves this excellent performance with an average per - bit complexity of just @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the number of transmit and receive antennas , respectively . * with an outer turbo code , the proposed detector achieves good coded bit error performance as well .",
    "for example , in a 600 transmit and 600 receive antennas v - blast system with a high spectral efficiency of 200 bps / hz ( using bpsk and rate-1/3 turbo code ) , our simulation results show that the proposed detector performs close to within about 4.6 db from the theoretical capacity .",
    "we note that performance with such closeness to capacity has not been reported in the literature so far for such large number of antennas using a practical complexity detector .",
    "* we have adopted the proposed detector for the low - complexity decoding of large full - rate non - orthogonal stbcs from division algebras ( da ) in @xcite .",
    "we decode the @xmath3 full - rate non - orthogonal stbc from da ( which has 256 data symbols in one stbc matrix ) using the proposed detector and show that it performs close to within about 5.5 db from capacity using 4-qam and rate-3/4 turbo code at a spectral efficiency of 24 bps / hz . *",
    "we point out that because of the high complexities involved in the decoding of large non - orthogonal stbcs using other known detectors , the ber performance of such high - rate large non - orthogonal stbcs have not been reported in the literature so far .",
    "the very fact that we could show the simulated ber performance plots ( both uncoded as well as turbo coded ) for a @xmath3 full - rate non - orthogonal stbc with 256 complex symbols in one stbc matrix in itself is a clear indication of the superior low - complexity attribute of the proposed detector . to our knowledge , this is the first time that simulated ber plots and nearness to capacity results for a full - rate @xmath3 stbc from da are reported in the literature ; this became feasible due to the low - complexity attribute of the proposed detector .",
    "* we also illustrate the applicability of the proposed detector in the low - complexity detection of large multicarrier cdma ( mc - cdma ) systems . in large mc - cdma systems with hundreds of users ,",
    "the proposed detector is shown to achieve near single - user performance , at an average per - bit complexity linear in number of users , which is quite appealing for its use in practical cdma systems .",

    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "the complexity involved in the las operation is due to three components : @xmath4 initial computation of @xmath87 in ( [ 3eq9w ] ) , @xmath5 update of @xmath48 in each step as per ( [ 3eq21w ] ) , and @xmath6 the average number of steps required to reach a fixed point .",

    "the average per - bit complexity of generating initial vectors using mf , zf , and mmse are @xmath93 , @xmath0 , and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the higher complexity of zf and mmse compared to mf is because of the need to perform matrix inversion operation in zf / mmse .",

    "this complexity is an order superior compared to the well known zf - sic detector with ordering , whose per - bit complexity is @xmath94 .",
    "in this section , we present the uncoded / coded ber performance of the proposed las detector in v - blast obtained through simulations , and compare with those of other detectors .",
    "the las algorithm used is the sequential las with circular checking of bits starting from the first antenna bit .",
    "we also quantify how far is the proposed detector s turbo coded ber performance away from the theoretical capacity .",

    "this improvement is likely due to the potential diversity in the ordering ( selection ) in zf - sic , whereas the flooring for @xmath101 is likely due to interference being large beyond the cancellation ability of the zf - sic . *",
    "the behavior of mf - las and zf - las for increasing @xmath95 are interesting . starting with the mf output as the initial vector , the",
    "mf - las always achieves better performance than mf .",
    "more interestingly , this improved performance of mf - las compared to that of mf increases remarkably as @xmath95 increases .",
    "for example , for @xmath100 , the performance improves by an order in ber ( i.e. , @xmath102 ber for mf versus @xmath103 ber for mf - las ) , whereas for @xmath104 the performance improves by four - orders in ber ( i.e. , @xmath105 ber for mf versus @xmath106 ber for mf - las ) .",
    "this is due to the large system effect in the las algorithm which is able to successfully pick up much of the diversity possible in the system .",
    "this large system performance superiority of the las is in line with the observations / results reported in @xcite for a large cdma system @xmath89large number of antennas in our case , whereas it was large number of users in @xcite@xmath107 .",
    "* while the zf - las performs slightly better than zf - sic for antennas less than 4 , zf - sic performs better than zf - las for antennas in the range 4 to 24 .",
    "this is likely because , for antennas less than 4 , the ber of zf is small enough for the las to clean up the zf initial vector into an output vector better than the zf - sic output vector .",
    "however , for antennas in the range of 4 to 24 , the ber of zf gets high to an extent that the zf - las is less effective in cleaning the initial vector beyond the diversity performance achieved by the zf - sic . a more interesting observation",

    "<S> such large mimo systems will be of immense interest because of the very high spectral efficiencies possible in such systems . </S>",
    "<S> we present a low - complexity detector which achieves uncoded near - exponential diversity performance for hundreds of antennas ( i.e. , achieves near siso awgn performance in a large mimo fading environment ) with an average per - bit complexity of just @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the number of transmit and receive antennas , respectively . with an outer turbo code , </S>",
    "<S> the proposed detector achieves good coded bit error performance as well . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in a 600 transmit and 600 receive antennas v - blast system with a high spectral efficiency of 200 bps / hz ( using bpsk and rate-1/3 turbo code ) , our simulation results show that the proposed detector performs close to within about 4.6 db from theoretical capacity . </S>",
    "<S> we also adopt the proposed detector for the low - complexity decoding of high - rate non - orthogonal space - time block codes ( stbc ) from division algebras ( da ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we have decoded the @xmath3 full - rate non - orthogonal stbc from da using the proposed detector and show that it performs close to within about 5.5 db of the capacity using 4-qam and rate-3/4 turbo code at a spectral efficiency of 24 bps / hz . the practical feasibility of the proposed high - performance low - complexity detector could potentially trigger wide interest in the implementation of large mimo systems . </S>",
    "<S> we also illustrate the applicability of the proposed detector in the low - complexity detection of large multicarrier cdma ( mc - cdma ) systems . in large mc - cdma systems with hundreds of users , </S>",
    "<S> the proposed detector is shown to achieve near single - user performance at an average per - bit complexity linear in number of users , which is quite appealing for its use in practical cdma systems .    </S>",
