    "the structure of galaxies at very large galactocentric radii ( and hence very faint light levels ) is a subject of much current interest . from a theoretical perspective ,",
    "high resolution simulations of galaxy formation indicate that many signatures of the galaxy assembly process should lie buried in these parts ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the discovery of stellar substructure in galaxy halos ( e.g. @xcite ) lends strong support to the idea that galaxies assemble , at least in part , via the accretion of small satellite systems .",
    "however , equally important constraints on galaxy formation come from studies of their smooth stellar components with key questions concerning the profile , shape and composition of stellar halos and outer disks .",
    "unfortunately , the low surface brightness of these parts ( typically @xmath8  mag  arcsec@xmath2 ) poses a significant challenge for studies of diffuse unresolved light and few robust constraints have been derived to date from this technique ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "several recent studies have mapped galaxy structure to well below the usual depths of traditional surface photometry by taking advantage of unique datasets and/or innovative analysis techniques .",
    "@xcite carefully rescale and stack over 1000 edge - on galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) in order to detect emission as faint as @xmath9mag  arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "they find evidence for the presence of flattened red power - law ( c / a@xmath10 ) stellar halos around disk galaxies .",
    "@xcite take advantage of the unprecedented depth of the hubble ultra deep field to study faint extraplanar emission around an edge - on galaxy at @xmath11 and find a similar power - law halo component dominating at very faint surface brightness levels .",
    "on the other hand , deep star count analyses of the low luminosity systems ngc  300 and m33 indicate the presence of only a disk component at very large radii ( @xcite , ferguson et al . in prep ) .    in this letter",
    ", we exploit the issac newton telescope _ wide - field camera _ survey of m31 to determine the surface brightness profile of the galaxy along the minor axis . using the combination of traditional surface photometry in highly - crowded regions and faint red giant branch ( rgb ) star counts in diffuse regions , we are able to trace the profile from the innermost regions of m31 out to a projected radius of 4  or @xmath0kpc . the contiguous nature of the survey provides excellent sampling of the profile at all radii and the ability to distinguish local density enhancements in m31 from fluctuations in background galaxy counts and the foreground distribution of galactic stars .",
    "previous results from our photometric survey have been reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the isaac newton telescope _ wide field camera _ is a 4-chip eev 4k@xmath122k ccd mosaic camera which images @xmath130.29 square degrees . during the period",
    "sept 2000jan 2004 , we used this camera to image 163 contiguous fields ( corresponding to @xmath14 square degrees ) in the disk and halo of m31 .",
    "our map covers an elliptical region of semi - major ( minor ) axis 4(2.5 )  or @xmath1355(34 )  kpc , with an additional @xmath15 square degree extension towards the south .",
    "images were taken in the johnson v and gunn @xmath16 bands under mainly good atmospheric conditions and typical seeing better than 1.2 .",
    "the exposure time of 800 - 1000s per passband per field allowed us to reach @xmath17 , v@xmath18 ( s / n@xmath135 ) which is sufficient to detect individual red giant branch ( rgb ) stars to m@xmath19 and main sequence stars to m@xmath20 at the distance of m31 .",
    "details of the survey observing strategy and pipeline reductions are discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "objects are classified as noise artifacts , galaxies , or stars according to their morphology . in the outer halo fields , we typically detect equal numbers of resolved and unresolved sources within the magnitude and color ranges of interest . of the extended sources ,",
    "approximately 20% are @xmath21compact in the sense of being within the 3 - 5 sigma range of the stellar boundary in the classification statistic and having an ellipticity of @xmath22 . making the plausible assumption that half of these are genuinely extended",
    ", we expect that the contamination due to mis - classified barely resolved field galaxies is small and , in general , considerably less than 10% of the total number of detected sources .",
    "due to the presence of the galactic plane , foreground contamination increases smoothly from @xmath1313000 stars per square degree at the southern extremity of the survey to @xmath1320000 stars per square degree at the northern extremity ( integrated over all magnitudes ) .",
    "this foreground variation , coupled with our current lack of suitable comparison fields uncontaminated by m31 , is the primary uncertainty in our star counts at very large radii .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the surface density of stellar - like sources with magnitudes and colours consistent with being rgb stars at the distance of m31 .",
    "white patches in the map are either areas contaminated by saturated stars ( and the nuclear region of m31 ) or are due to small gaps in the survey coverage . as reported in earlier papers @xcite , the int wfc survey has revealed a wealth of stellar substructure in the outskirts of m31 . our focus here , however , is the smooth structure of the galaxy s outskirts .",
    "the sources shown in figure [ fig1 ] are selected to have @xmath23 and @xmath24 and we refer to these as red rgb stars .",
    "we select blue rgb stars as stellar sources with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the lower magnitude limits for both red and blue rgb stars are conservatively set at roughly one magnitude brighter than the survey 5-@xmath27 detection threshold to mitigate against the effects of varying completeness .",
    "if age is constant across the survey area , the red and blue selection criteria isolate metal - rich and metal - poor giants respectively .",
    "our large - area contiguous survey of m31 enables us to trace the surface brightness profile along the southern minor axis from the inner regions out to well beyond previously - published measurements @xcite .",
    "the presence of significant substructure in the outskirts of m31 , especially in the southern half of the galaxy , means the region over which to compute a representative profile must be chosen carefully .",
    "inspection of the distribution of rgb stars orthogonal to the minor axis indicates that a region of @xmath28  on either side of the minor axis ( defined as position angle of 141.9 ) is free of obvious contaminating debris ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "debris from the giant stellar stream is a serious problem beyond @xmath130.5  to the west of the minor axis , whereas the north - east shelf overdensity is a problem further eastward .    in order to study the light profile in the inner regions of m31",
    ", we create a large mosaiced image from individual v- and @xmath16-band pointings resampled at 1  resolution .",
    "overlaps between pointings are used to adjust for sky brightness variations during the observations .",
    "we then carry out surface photometry on this mosaic .",
    "the v- and _ i_-band surface brightness is computed as the median value in a series of equally - spaced ( 10 ) wedge - shaped bins with width increasing linearly from 100  in the innermost regions to 820  at a radius of 1 , to ensure overlap with the star counts .",
    "this sampling was chosen as a compromise between maximising resolution in the inner parts and signal - to - noise considerations in the outer parts , and minimising the number of bright star halos affecting the surface brightness photometry .",
    "this technique works well out to a radius of @xmath29 beyond which uncertainties in the overall sky level correction start to become significant .",
    "beyond 1.0 , the sky background dominates the signal and these regions are used to determine the appropriate background value to subtract from the measured surface brightness profile .    to explore the profile further out ,",
    "we employ rgb star counts computed in rectangular bins of size 3@xmath12 1  ( see the dashed lines in figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the validity of using this technique in conjunction with the direct surface brightness measures rests on the fact that a significant fraction of the light of an old stellar population originates in luminous rgb stars .",
    "the rgb star counts are split into blue and red rgb components and are used to extend the v- and _ i-_band profiles respectively .",
    "we correct the star counts for incompleteness due to crowding using the prescription of irwin & trimble ( 1984 ) , although by restricting the use of star counts to the outer regions of m31 the correction is never larger than a factor of two .",
    "an additional additive correction to the star counts is made for `` background '' contamination arising from foreground milky way stars and unresolved background galaxies .",
    "this level is set by computing the surface density of unresolved sources with magnitudes and colours typical of m31 rgb stars in several of the outermost pointings in our int wfc survey , lying at radii 45 .",
    "we assume that these sources are entirely contaminants and while this may not be strictly correct due to a possibly very extended m31 halo @xcite , it does not have a major impact on the profile over the surface brightness range that we are considering here .",
    "finally , the star count profiles are shifted vertically(counts ) and @xmath30(counts ) to the blue and red star counts respectively . in each case , @xmath31counts  denotes the background - corrected rgb star counts per square degree . ] to overlap with the photometrically - calibrated inner surface brightness profiles in the radial range @xmath32 . in joining the profiles in this way",
    ", we implicitly assume that the slope of the luminosity function is constant with radius ; that is , that the rgb star counts represent a constant fraction of the total flux at each position .",
    "this assumption seems valid given the lack of an obvious radial metallicity gradient within the m31 halo ( @xcite , and see section 4 ) .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the combined v- and _ i-_band minor axis profiles . that the profiles are smooth across the overlap region serves as reassurance that no features or slope changes are introduced as a result of combining profiles constructed from the different techniques .",
    "overlaid on the surface brightness profile in figure [ fig2 ] is the de vaucouleurs r@xmath33 law that @xcite found best - characterised their minor axis profile over the radial range 1  to 1.5 .",
    "this model has an effective radius of r@xmath34 or 1.4  kpc , derived from scaling @xcite s original value to the currently - accepted distance of 785  kpc @xcite .",
    "as can be seen , this model also provides an excellent description of the profile derived here . the slight mismatch between the data and the model at radii of 0.10.4occurs where the contribution of the disk component  which we have neglected here  to the minor axis profile is a maximum @xcite .",
    "this result goes beyond merely confirming the findings of previous studies .",
    "earlier work has relied on measurements from various sources in order to cover a sufficient radial range along the minor axis @xcite .",
    "these measurements have not only been made by different authors with different telescopes / instruments , but often in different filters , and several assumptions have been required to place them on a common photometric system .",
    "the uncertainty this has introduced into the minor axis profiles published to date has been unclear .",
    "our ability to determine the profile from 0.02 to 4using a single dataset thus represents a significant advance .    beyond a radius of 1.4 , the minor axis profile levels off relative to the extrapolation of the inner r@xmath33 law .",
    "such a flattening has also recently been reported by @xcite but at a slightly larger radius of of 2.2 .",
    "these authors refer to this outer component as the @xmath21halo. overlaid on the left - hand panel of figure [ fig2 ] is a projected nfw profile @xcite of scale - radius 0.25  or 3.4  kpc .",
    "nfw profiles provide excellent descriptions of the density profiles of dark matter halos and asymptote towards @xmath35 at large radii ( though we note that an nfw dark matter halo would have a much larger scale length than the above ) .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows that while an nfw profile with this scale radius provides a reasonably good match to the outer parts of the minor axis profile , the radial density fall - off is actually somewhat steeper than r@xmath36 .",
    "indeed , a power - law fit to the minor axis surface brightness profile beyond 1.5  yields an index of @xmath37 .",
    "alternatively , the outer profile can also be adequately fit with an exponential of scalelength 1  or @xmath38  kpc .",
    "an advantage of nfw and exponential profiles is that they remain finite when integrated from the centre ( although in the case of an nfw profile an outer radius limit is also required , which we adopt here as 100  kpc ) .",
    "using the parameters noted previously , we find that the absolute v - band magnitude of the halo is -17.1 and -17.0 for an nfw and exponential profile respectively . allowing for 0.2 mag of extinction and a total m31 v - band magnitude of m@xmath39 @xcite , this implies the fraction of the total m31 luminosity contained in the halo component is only @xmath40 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows a v-_i _ minor axis colour profile constructed from the individual v- and _ i-_band surface brightness profiles .",
    "the colour reddens over the inner 0.5  but then levels off to a constant value of @xmath41 , within the extent of the uncertainties .",
    "rather remarkably , the break in the minor axis profile at 1.4  is unaccompanied by any obvious change in colour , implying that the same metal - rich stellar population dominates at all radii .",
    "this is further supported by @xcite s finding of the same metallicity distribution function at 20 and 30  kpc , radii which bridge the region where the surface brightness profile changes slope . taken together , these results make it difficult to associate the flat outer component seen along the minor axis of m31 with a classical @xmath21population ii halo .",
    "understanding the nature of this new structural component in m31 will require further photometric and spectroscopic studies of its constituent populations .",
    "for example , do these stars exhibit a distinct kinematical signature from the rotating inner components @xcite ? does the halo shape remain constant with increasing radius ?",
    "@xcite find no evidence for the halo becoming significantly rounder out to @xmath42 however inspection of figure [ fig1 ] indicates that the off - axis fields they used to measure the flattening would have been contaminated by stellar debris .",
    "our finding of a red power - law halo component at large radius in m31 is especially interesting in light of the @xcite and @xcite analyses of faint extraplanar emission around distant galaxies .",
    "the stellar halos observed in those studies fall off as @xmath43 to @xmath44 , similar to the @xmath45 found here .",
    "these indices also compare favourably to that of the milky way halo @xcite .",
    "additional studies of the faint outskirts of galaxies will be required to understand whether these power - law components are indeed ubiquitous and to derive constraints on their origin .",
    "square degree area around m31 .",
    "the outer ellipse denotes a flattened ellipsoid ( aspect ratio 3:5 ) of semi - major axis 55  kpc , while the inner ellipse has a semi - major axis 27  kpc and represents the approximate extent of the bright disk .",
    "the area used to compute the minor axis surface brightness profile ( @xmath46 of the minor axis ) is delineated by the dashed lines .",
    "overlaid are the locations of the fields observed by @xcite and @xcite ( large rectangles ) and @xcite ( small rectangles).[fig1 ] ]"
