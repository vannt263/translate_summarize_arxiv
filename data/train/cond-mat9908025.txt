    "statistical mechanics can be formulated in any of a set of ensembles distinguished by the relationship between the system and its environment @xcite .",
    "the principal members of this set are the microcanonical ( prescribed energy ) and canonical ( prescribed temperature ) ensembles . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "( when it exists ) the ensembles yield the same predictions ( and are , in this sense , equivalent ) and the choice of ensemble is a matter of practical convenience .",
    "the canonical ensemble tends to win this contest because it circumnavigates the hard - constant - energy constraint imposed by the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the two ensembles are , however , not always equivalent @xcite .",
    "they differ for systems which are ` small ' in some sense : inherently small systems such as nuclei or clusters @xcite ; systems with unscreened long - range forces @xcite where the thermodynamic limit is problematic ; and systems at critical points @xcite , which are our principal concern here .",
    "theoretical studies of critical phenomena are almost invariably conducted within the framework of the canonical ensemble @xcite . in consequence",
    "there is no substantive framework within which to interpret computational studies of microcanonical critical behavior .",
    "such studies do , nevertheless , exist , having been motivated , variously , by the belief that the microcanonical framework may have some computational advantages @xcite and by the discovery @xcite that , apparently , critical anomalies in the microcanonical heat capacity are significantly enhanced with respect to their canonical counterparts .",
    "this paper goes some way towards supplying the missing framework .",
    "we develop ( section 2 ) a finite - size - scaling theory @xcite for the microcanonical entropy ( the density of states ) of a system with a critically - divergent heat capacity . in",
    "so doing we have , of necessity , to consider more general questions about the structure of the density of states of a finite - size system in particular the implications of well - established results for the finite - size structure of the canonical partition function @xcite .",
    "though somewhat more than a phenomenology , our theory falls short of being microscopically explicit : to determine an explicit form for the relevant scaling function we need to appeal ( section 3 ) to monte carlo ( mc ) measurements of the critical _ canonical _ energy probability distribution ( pdf ) .",
    "the canonical energy pdf itself has a near - critical finite - size - scaling form which has featured in a number of studies of critical points in fluids @xcite and lattice gauge theories @xcite . since energy fluctuations ( like the critical anomaly in the canonical specific heat which they control ) are relatively weak ( by comparison with the fluctuations of the order parameter , and the divergence of its response function ) the degree of ` scaling ' reported in previously measured energy pdfs has been relatively poor unsatisfactorily so for our purposes here .",
    "this problem is addressed in section 3 .",
    "we show that one can fold out ( from the measured distributions ) the sub - dominant ( but significant ) non - scaling effects that are associated with the constant background contribution to the canonical heat capacity , _ negative _ in the case of the 3d ising model @xcite .",
    "this procedure exposes the underlying behavior , which manifests scaling to an impressive degree .",
    "in addition to providing us with the platform needed for this work , this procedure may offer the basis for improving the mixed - scaling - field theory @xcite of critical points in systems that belong to the ising universality class but which do not have full ising symmetry ; recent studies @xcite have suggested that the current framework is not fully satisfactory .",
    "the scaling form for the critical energy pdf allows us to determine the scaling form of the microcanonical entropy . in section 4",
    "we explore this form and show that it is consistent with predictions for both the bulk - critical limit ( as regards the parameters characterizing the specific heat singularity @xcite ) and the finite - size critical limit ( the fisher - privman constant @xcite ) .",
    "the microcanonical entropy also provides us with a unified basis for dealing with both the canonical and the microcanonical specific heats ( section 5 ) .",
    "we show that the ` corrections ' to the scaling behavior of the canonical specific heat ( the _ negative _ background constant ) have subtle consequences for the microcanonical behavior . in particular they serve to _ amplify _ the difference between microcanonical and canonical behavior , and are at least partially responsible for the strength of the anomaly observed in some microcanonical studies @xcite .",
    "we consider a d - dimensional many - body system of linear dimension @xmath0 ; we assume hypercubic geometry with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the canonical partition function is , in principle , a discrete sum over system microstates ( @xmath1 ) or system energy levels ( @xmath2 ) : @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the degeneracy of level @xmath2 .",
    "we shall suppose that the system is sufficiently large that the sum over levels can be replaced by an integral : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the energy density .",
    "the function @xmath7 is the _ density of states _ ; as we have defined it , it is a true density , having dimensions of inverse energy .",
    "we note that the transition from the discrete representation ( eq .",
    "[ eq : canonicalpfdisc ] ) to its continuum counterpart ( eq .  [ eq : canonicalpfdef ] ) requires some care : it is discussed in appendix a.    our microcanonical scaling theory comprises a proposal for the form of the density of states function .",
    "we formulate it in two stages .",
    "consider first a regime remote from critical points or lines of phase coexistence .",
    "in such a regime we make the general finite - size ansatz @xcite : @xmath8 ^{1/2 }   e^{l^d s(\\epsilon)}\\ ] ] the structure proposed for the prefactor makes this a little more than simply a _ definition _ of the microcanonical entropy density @xmath9 . in its support",

    "( [ eq : canonicalpfresone ] ) recovers the prefactor - free form of the canonical partition function believed to be widely appropriate in regions ( those where the saddle point integration is to be trusted ) remote from critical points or lines of phase coexistence @xcite .",
    "we note that this form is achieved by virtue of the prefactor that _ does _ appear in the density of states ansatz ( eq .  [ eq : omegaansatz ] ) , which is just such as to cancel the contributions made by the fluctuations about the saddle point @xcite .    the argument we have given leaves",
    "open the possibility of power - law corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq : canonicalpfresone ] )",
    ". it has long been believed , and more recently established rather generally @xcite , that the corrections to the leading form are actually _ exponentially _ small in the system size .",
    "since the saddle - point integration necessarily generates power - law corrections , one must suppose that there are compensating power - law corrections to the ansatz ( eq .  [ eq : omegaansatz ] ) for the density of states .",
    "this conclusion serves as a warning ( already suggested by the double appearance of the function @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegaansatz ] ) ) that the microcanonical framework faces problems which are skirted in the canonical formalism @xcite .",
    "now , more specifically , consider a system , of the kind specified above , in the vicinity of a critical point .",
    "we will suppose that the critical point has a divergent heat capacity ; where we need to be more specific we shall assume it is a member of the d=3 ising universality class ( or , more specially still , the d=3 ising model itself ) . within the microcanonical framework the critical point of such a system is located by a critical value @xmath14 of the energy density , sharply - defined in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we are concerned with the behavior of the microcanonical entropy for energies in the vicinity of this critical value . to describe this regime we introduce the dimensionless scaling variable @xcite @xmath15    where @xmath16 is an appropriate scale factor and the index is defined by @xmath17 with @xmath18 the index ( assumed positive ) characterizing the heat capacity divergence , and @xmath19 the correlation length index @xcite .",

( [ eq : omegaansatz ] ) is consistent with the pre - factor - free structure of the canonical partition function @xcite and with the behavior of the simple models discussed in appendix b. given the growing interest in the behavior of mesoscopically - sized systems , this proposal seems to merit some further study , with more rigor than we have attempted to offer here .",
    "second , we have shown how one can fold out from the canonical energy fluctuation spectrum the principal corrections to scaling .",
    "the underlying behavior exhibits scale - invariance to a degree that seems remarkable , given the relative weakness of energy fluctuations .",
    "it is , we have seen , also largely consistent with established 3d - ising critical properties .",
    "third , we have provided a finite - size scaling theory of the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "this was the original motivation for this work specifically , the suggestion @xcite that the finite - size - smearing of critical behavior characteristic of the canonical ensemble is ` greatly reduced ' within the microcanonical framework .",
    "reference  @xcite offers two pieces of supporting evidence for this contention , which merit final comment .",
    "reference  @xcite suggests , firstly , that , in the vicinity of @xmath139 , the microcanonical entropy ( measured with the techniques described in @xcite ) can be adequately represented by a form ( eq .",
    "6 of reference  @xcite ) which allows for _ no _ finite - size corrections at all , and which corresponds essentially to the large @xmath67 limit ( eq .  [ eq : largex ] ) of our scaling function .",
    "in fact the quality of the fit provided by this representation is rather poor .",
    "and we would expect it to be so .",
    "the measured microcanonical entropy evolves in a _ manifestly smooth _",
    "way @xcite between the limiting thermodynamic forms appropriate above and below @xmath139 ; eq .",
    "6 of reference  @xcite is non - analytic at @xmath139 .",
    "moreover , in analyzing data for the entropy and its derivatives , it is  we have seen  essential ( on all systems practically accessible ) to do justice to the corrections associated with the background constant @xmath56 . even in the thermodynamic limit the corrections allowed for in eq .",
    "( 8) of reference @xcite do not do this .    the second piece of supporting evidence offered in reference @xcite is a striking enhancement of the critical peak in the microcanonical specific heat , with respect to its canonical counterpart .",
    "as we have seen , this behavior is at least partly due @xcite to the effects associated with @xmath56 ; figure 9 indicates that the underlying differences are rather less dramatic .",
