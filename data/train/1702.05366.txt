    "recent cosmological observations favoring the scenario of spatially flat and accelerated universe .",
    "observations come from hubble diagram of sne ia supernovae are best fitted by spatially flat accelerated cosmological models @xcite-@xcite . besides , other observations from cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) and baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) are also strong evidences for this scenario @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this currently observed speeding up expansion of the universe leads to the fact that there is a repulsive force acting in the universe space - time .    according to our current understanding of the universe history ,",
    "the radiation era was followed by a matter dominated era during which most of the universe structures like stars , galaxies and galaxy clusters we now observe was formed by gravitational instabilities . through this phase of the universe evolution , a particular form of gravitating but non - baryonic form of matter",
    "is formed .",
    "this sort of matter which is non - relativistic does not interact with radiation , and so is called dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "late in this matter dominated phase , a new but very peculiar form of invisible and non - gravitating `` matter '' started to dominate .",
    "this sort of `` matter '' does not interact with baryons , radiations , or any other sort of visible matter .",
    "it is now known as dark energy ( de ) .",
    "observational evidences show that , see for ex . @xcite and @xcite-@xcite , our universe at present contains approximately @xmath3 only of radiation and baryonic matter that is well known by the standard model of particle physics and can be detected in laboratory and so is considered visible . while about @xmath4 is the non - baryonic dark matter . the rest of our universe content , which is about @xmath5 is the exotic component known as dark energy . as a result , this dominated dark energy component antigravitates leading to the present observed universe expansion .",
    "although dark energy is an acceptable and effective description for such large scale homogeneous and isotropic accelerated universe , identifying its origin and nature is one of the most debated questions in physics and cosmology .",
    "large variety of models are proposed to describe the nature of such dark energy @xcite,@xcite . as the energy density due to de remains unchanged throughout the universe space - time ,",
    "the simplest choice was to revive the idea of einstein about the cosmological constant @xmath6 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this together with cold dark matter ( cdm ) provides the standard model for cosmology @xmath6cdm @xcite-@xcite , which appears to be in a very good agreement with observational data . in einstein s field equation",
    ", this term has the concept of intrinsic energy density of vacuum @xcite .",
    "however , this arises an important question , why the observed value of vacuum energy density is very far below that is predicted from particle physics ? .",
    "this is the famous fine tuning problem .",
    "another important question is why the energy densities of the vacuum and the matter are of the same order of magnitude today ? , the famous coincidence problem .",
    "dynamical models are other alternative to the cosmological constant .",
    "some of these are the minimal coupled scalar fields or quintessence @xcite-@xcite , k - essence @xcite-@xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite-@xcite , all have an equation of state parameter @xmath7 .",
    "these models adopt the idea of the possibility of unification of the two dark sectors , dark energy and dark matter .",
    "models with @xmath8 knowing as phantom energy models @xcite , @xcite consider a growing vacuum energy with expansion .",
    "a more general class of models considers a parameter varies with the scale factor , or the red shift @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there are also some observational analysis which consider the variation of @xmath9 with the red shift and with time @xcite , @xcite .",
    "modification of the governing equation , or the so called modified gravity theory @xcite , @xcite , is also one way of thinking .",
    "the idea of unification of de and dm is a promising one and chaplygin gas model is one of the most acclaimed models representing it .",
    "this model was proposed by kamenshchik et .",
    "al . @xcite as early as 2001 where they assumed that the universe , within the framework of standard cosmology , is filled with an exotic fluid obeys the chaplygin gas equation of state ( eos ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a positive constant and @xmath12 .",
    "this model has the advantage of smooth transition between different phases of the universe .",
    "many authors then extended this model using the idea of generalizing or modifying the eos of the background fluid in order to improve the behavior of the fluid throughout the universe evolution . in 2002 , bento et .",
    "@xcite extended the model to a more general form known as the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) model where the @xmath13 constant is considered in the range @xmath14 .",
    "other various models based on chaplygin gas were also proposed such as the modified chaplygin gas model introduced in 2002 by benaoum @xcite where he could interpolate between standard fluids at high energy densities and chaplygin gas fluids at low energy densities using the eos @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath11 and @xmath17 are positive constants , and the hybrid chaplygin gas model introduced by bili@xmath2 et .",
    "al . in 2005",
    "@xcite and leads to transient acceleration .    in this work ,",
    "we have adopted a class of dynamical models in which the eos has the advantage of interpolation between two different chaplygin gas models .",
    "our fluid is a barotropic one with an eos can be considered as a correction to the vacuum eos by a power law .",
    "this power law has the advantage of interpolation between the two equations of state of the de and dm which might describe some sort of smooth phase transition .",
    "another advantage of this model is that it is not only interpolating between dust and de in early and late times , but also it has a more general eos for de that enables the cosmological constant as a special case .",
    "this has the more advantage of a general asymptotic solution than chaplygin gas which goes to the cosmological constant .",
    "we present an exact solution of the equations which enables more accurate results for the calculations of the luminosity distance , while observations of hubble diagram of sne ia supernovae are used to further constrain the model parameters .",
    "we study the energy density and the equation of state parameter evolutions .",
    "the analysis of the eos shows that the dynamical properties of both dark sectors can be described through this model which lets our choice seems natural because of the smooth transition .",
    "we also calculate the deceleration parameter to examine the expansion of the universe due to the model .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows ; in the following section we have formulated the model . in section [ sectr ] the mathematical treatment of the model is made .",
    "section [ case1 ] treats the first case of study of our model where the causality constraints are examined and the dynamics of the universe is studied where the equation of the luminosity distance as a function of red shift is solved and parameters are constrained through hubble diagram observations , the energy density and the deceleration parameter evolutions due to the model are examined .",
    "section [ case2 ] treats the second case of study of our model .",
    "section [ seconc ] concludes our work .",
    "we are working through the standard frw cosmology where the metric in the spatially flat geometry is @xmath18 where we consider units with @xmath19 . using the energy momentum tensor given by @xmath20",
    "where in comoving coordinates @xmath21 , the einstein s equation will lead to the friedman equations @xmath22 while the conservation equation @xmath23 gives @xmath24 now we have to consider an eos to close the system .",
    "it is a fact that dark energy dominates the universe today and an adequate eos for this component is @xmath25 .",
    "observations indicate that the eos parameter @xmath9 is close to @xmath26 and people are now targeting to confirm whether @xmath9 is constant or varies as the universe expands . owing to this fact , nojiri and odintsov @xcite considered a general eos of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an arbitrary function may be considered as a correction to the standard de equation of state .",
    "@xmath0tefan@xmath1i@xmath2 @xcite , @xcite studied in details the case of @xmath29 with a constant @xmath30 , and nojiri et .",
    "@xcite studied the future singularity associated with this model .    in this work we adopted a barotropic fluid with an eos which is also a correction to the standard dark energy eos .",
    "the fluid pressure has a general power law form for the density dependence @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are constants which are considered as free parameters .",
    "this enables interpolation between different powers for the density , so that the phase transitions during the universe evolution are described smoothly .",
    "the eos parameter is given by @xmath36",
    "let s now study the evolution of the physical quantities of the universe due to our model .",
    "considering units with @xmath37 , eqns ( [ dot])-([cons ] ) reduce to    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the hubble parameter . combining eq([van1 ] ) to eq([rodot ] ) we get @xmath40 where again @xmath13 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are constants related to those of ( [ van1 ] ) through the relations @xmath44 the solution of equation([dhdt ] ) indicates the evolution of the hubble parameter with time .",
    "this equation is integrated to give @xmath45    however , our model is not describing a pure dark energy , in which case the values of the parameters are totally free and are not constrained .",
    "instead , our model able to follow the smooth phase transition which takes place through the universe evolution .",
    "this restricts the parameter values to obey the limits satisfied by observations so that for early time we must have the equation of state of the perfect fluid .    accordingly",
    ", we first have to study the asymptotic behavior of @xmath46 . from one side , this indicates to what extent our model agrees the real evolution of the universe , and from the other side may also fixes the limits of some of our model parameters .",
    "table [ tab : ass ] shows this behavior for the different ranges of of the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "@cccc@ case & ranges of @xmath42 and @xmath43 & large @xmath47 & small @xmath47 +   + @xmath48 & @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 + @xmath54 & @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath55 & @xmath56 & @xmath52 + @xmath57 & @xmath58 @xmath50 @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 + @xmath59 & @xmath58 @xmath50 @xmath55 & @xmath56 & @xmath52 +    [ tab : ass ]    one can see from the table that the values of negative @xmath42 must be precluded in our calculations as a result of the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath46 function .",
    "this is because for asymptotically perfect fluid behavior of our universe , the @xmath46 function at large @xmath47 forces @xmath42 to be positive if @xmath43 is negative , and forces @xmath60 to be positive if @xmath43 is positive , which does not satisfy constraints for the pre - assumptions .    on the other hand , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath46 for the two cases of positive @xmath42 can attain the perfect fluid behavior at large @xmath47 if @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the case of @xmath63 and if @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the case of @xmath66 .",
    "these two cases will be studied in details .",
    "finally let s study the different classes of solutions due the fixed points in the model .",
    "this general class of models can be studied using the phase space method developed in @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram in fig.[fig : phase ] shows that there are no fixed points in the solution so that there are no different classes , here @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "[ fig : phase ]",
    "this is the first case that match the dark fluid dynamics .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the eos at large @xmath47 , early times , has the form @xmath69 , so that for @xmath61 and @xmath62 we have the perfect fluid eos at early times .",
    "let s now examine the constraints that can be obtained by applying the causality condition to this model .",
    "spherical sound waves are lunched as a result of the overpressure due to the initial overdensity in the dm and gas .",
    "these oscillations have a speed which is an indication to the velocity by which such perturbations are transmitted .",
    "accordingly , it must not exceed the speed of light , which is a condition of causality .",
    "in barotropic cosmic fluid , the speed of these sound waves is defined by the relation @xmath70 this must satisfy the condition @xmath71 that must be obeyed at all values of @xmath72 .",
    "accordingly , applying causality constraints , one may get an indication for the available ranges for the values of the free parameters in the eos . now using ( [ van1 ] )",

    "in fact , for the general values of @xmath72 we also have a large dependence on @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "accordingly , we have to make a check using the obtained optimized values for the parameters .      in this section",
    "we study the ability of our model to produce the physical quantities that can be really measured .",
    "this , of course , depends on the compatibility of the results of our model with the astrophysical data that are indeed observed .",
    "one of the most important observed data is that of the hubble diagram of type sne ia supernovae , which is a plot of the luminosity distance @xmath81 , that determines the flux of the source , as a function of the red shift .",
    "we will use these data to constrain the parameters in our model . due to the asymptotic and causality constraints",

    "accordingly , we will use numerical methods for solving the integral .",
    "this enables us to get an exact solution for the relation controlling the dependence of the luminosity distance on the red shift . in fig.[fig : lmnstyp ] we plot the apparent magnitude , @xmath100 , of the data set from conley et al .",

    "however , it is clear that observational data prefer the @xmath181 model than the @xmath183 one .",
    "more analysis such as density perturbation analysis may differentiate them and may favor one of the models than the other .",
    "we also studied the energy density evolution which ensures the smooth transition between the two dark sectors .",
    "furthermore , we examined the evolution of the eos parameter @xmath9 that again ensures its two extremes of @xmath185 and @xmath26 for early and late times .",
    "we also calculated the deceleration parameter @xmath133 and examined its evolution .",
    "calculations resulted in a negative @xmath133 for both model cases with the present day values of @xmath186 and @xmath187 due to the two models , while assures evolution towards more negativity to the future as the hubble parameter decreases , a clear evidence for accelerated expansion in agreement with observations .    due to the above mentioned results ,",
    "our model can be considered as a dark fluid model unifying the two dark sectors of the universe and succeeded in describing the evolution of the universe .",
