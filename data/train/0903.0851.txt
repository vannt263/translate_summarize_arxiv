    "detecting and classifying entanglement is an important challenge in the field of quantum information science .",
    "one problem is of a theoretical nature , to decide whether a given density matrix @xmath4 of multiple quantum systems is entangled or separable . even for bipartite systems , this is a hard problem for which no efficient general solution is known for higher - dimensional hilbert spaces , although a simple test based on the negativity of the partial transpose of the density matrix leads to a sufficient criterion for entanglement @xcite .",
    "if @xmath4 is entangled , the next issue is how to classify the type of entanglement . for more than two subsystems ,",
    "the full classification of all entanglement classes is as yet an unsolved problem ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in an experiment",
    "the practical task of detecting entanglement is even harder . if one would perform a full tomographic measurement , then in the limit of infinitely many data one would end up with an arbitrarily accurate estimate of a density matrix @xmath4 , and thus reduce the experimental problem to the theoretical problem mentioned above . in all other cases",
    ", one needs different tests that make use of less than full knowledge of the density matrix .",
    "the main practical disadvantage of full tomography is the rapidly growing number ( with the number of quantum systems and with the dimension of the hilbert spaces involved ) of measurements needed to find all elements of a density matrix . the other challenge is obtaining a physical density matrix from a _",
    "finite _ set of measured data  @xcite .",
    "thus there is an evergrowing demand for simpler experimental tests revealing entanglement .",
    "fortunately , for bipartite systems there exists a handful of different experimental techniques for entanglement detection  @xcite . here",
    "we will focus on a particular type of multi - partite entangled states ( namely , w states @xcite ) that can be produced in systems with variable numbers of excitations .",
    "we think in particular of experiments with atomic ensembles ( see , e.g. @xcite ) based on the dlcz protocol @xcite in which information can be stored in the number of atomic excitations of each ensemble , as well as of experiments on photonic systems ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , where the number of photons in a given mode can be used as a quantum variable . in the following",
    "we will use the words `` excitation '' and `` photon '' interchangeably .",
    "we define the state @xmath5 as a mode - entangled analogue of standard @xmath0-partite w states of qubits .",
    "it is a pure state where a single excitation is shared symmetrically between @xmath0 modes ) ] @xmath6 denotes a state of a mode with no excitations and @xmath7 is a state with a single excitation .",
    "the subscripts @xmath8 refer to modes that are in _ spatially distinct locations _ , so that the concepts of `` local operations '' and hence entanglement are unambiguously defined @xcite .",
    "we solve the problem of detecting the entanglement of a w state ( and it noisy cousins ) in two steps .",
    "in section ii we will focus on detecting and classifying entanglement within the subspace of a fixed _ total _ number of excitations ( in all modes together ) , namely one . in section iii",
    "we complete the analysis by including the remaining parts of hilbert space , the subspace with no excitations and the subspace with more than a single excitation in total . including both subspaces is crucial in the analysis .",
    "earlier detection schemes @xcite for w states in the context of photons were incomplete due to the neglect of states with multiple photons .",
    "moreover , we will discuss how to include imperfections such as losses , most releveant for the actual implementation of our method @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 parties can be entangled in many different ways . in some papers",
    "`` genuine '' @xmath0-party entangled states include states that are mixtures of @xmath1-party entangled states with @xmath2 , as long as such mixtures are not biseparable along any particular splitting of the @xmath0 parties into two groups ( for instance , @xcite ) . here",
    ", however , we will classify such mixtures as @xmath1-party entangled states , and the name `` genuine @xmath0-party entanglement '' in our case is reserved for states that can only be written as a mixture of pure states that all possess @xmath0-party entanglement .",
    "thus our criterion for genuine @xmath0-party entanglement is more severe .",
    "recently it has been suggested that uncertainty relations can be used as an entanglement criterion for finite - dimensional systems (  @xcite ; see also @xcite for an experimental implementation using local observables on two qubits ) .",
    "the uncertainty principle sets up a fundamental limit on how accurately observables of a quantum system can be simultaneously determined .",
    "for instance , if @xmath9 is some set of observables , then the measurement uncertainty in a given state @xmath4 is given by the sum of variances of all observables @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "this sum equals zero if and only if the state for which measurements of all @xmath10 are performed is a simultaneous eigenstate of all @xmath10 . if there is no such state ( when the observables are not all mutually commuting ) then there exists a positive number @xmath12 such that @xmath13 hofmann and takeuchi pointed out that the existence of the lower uncertainty bound @xmath12 can be employed as a separability criterion @xcite . indeed , if for some fixed set of observables an inequality of the form ( [ variance ] ) holds for _ all _ separable states then its violation is a signature of entanglement .",
    "the uncertainty bound has another obvious but important property .",
    "namely , one can never decrease the average uncertainty by mixing different states .",
    "in other words , for any state @xmath14 and any observable @xmath15 the following inequality holds @xmath16 the proof is rather straightforward and can be found in @xcite .    with the uncertainty criterion at hand we still have some flexibility over the type of observables to choose . in principle , all observables can be divided into two groups  local and nonlocal . whereas local observables can be measured separately for each and every party and therefore tend to be easier to access in an experiment , they often can not reliably detect genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "nonlocal observables , on the other hand , require a simultaneous nonlocal measurement of several parties at a time , which often is experimentally challenging . here",
    "we show how experimentally accessible nonlocal observables can be constructed to unambiguously detect genuine multipartite entanglement of the w - type .",
    "the basic idea behind the construction of nonlocal observables is to choose them as projectors onto a basis of @xmath0-partite entangled states .",
    "simultaneous eigenstates of these projectors are necessarily entangled states , and the variance in the projectors is minimized for @xmath0-party entangled states .",
    "a sufficiently small variance is then a sufficient criterion for genuine @xmath0-party entanglement . in order to illustrate this idea we will consider a system of four modes sharing a single photon .",
    "the problem at hand is then to find a set of nonlocal observables which allows to separate all four - mode separable and biseparable states from the genuinely four - mode entangled states such as the w state of eq .",
    "( [ nmode ] ) .",
    "we note that the general construction for an arbitrary @xmath0 can be done in a similar fashion . moreover , the nonlocal observables for single photons we use can be measured just using linear optics ( beam splitters ) and non - number resolving photodetectors .",
    "the hilbert space of a system of four modes sharing exactly one photon is spanned by four basis product vectors @xmath17 .",

    "( [ measure ] ) .",
    "losses , asymmetries in the beamsplitters , and non - ideal detectors are discussed in section [ losses ] . ]",
    "the next step is to choose four projectors onto the basis eqs .",
    "( [ wbasis1]-[wbasis4 ] ) as nonlocal observables @xmath20 . clearly , the only simultaneous eigenstates of all four operators @xmath10 are the four states @xmath21 .",
    "the total variance of all @xmath10 s vanishes for any one of the states @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast , for product states the total variance is bounded from below , since there exists no simultaneous product eigenstate of all the @xmath10 . therefore , we can write down an uncertainty - based entanglement criterion using nonlocal observables for any state @xmath22 within the subspace of a single excitation , in terms of the sum of variances of @xmath10 , @xmath23\\nonumber\\\\ & = & 1-\\sum_{i=1}^4 \\langle w_{i}|\\rho_1 |w_{i}\\rangle^2 ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscript 1 is there to remind us the state contains exactly 1 excitation .    to find the lower bound on @xmath24 for unentangled states it is sufficient to consider pure states thanks to eq .",

    "we have @xmath26 the next step is to find the minimum of @xmath27 by maximizing @xmath28 over all separable states @xmath29 containing a single excitation .",

    "two modes must be in the vacuum state , and the most general pure state in this class is of the form @xmath33 , or similar states resulting from permuting the different modes .",
    "biseparable states with at most three - mode entanglement .",
    "here at least one mode is in the vacuum state , and the most general pure state , up to permutations of modes , is of the form @xmath34 .    given the most general pure state within each class it is straightforward to calculate the three corresponding minimum values of @xmath27 , and the results are depicted in fig .",
    "for example , for any pure fully separable state @xmath29 the overlap @xmath35 for any @xmath36 , and so @xmath37 . for general mixtures of fully separable states ,",
    "this number gives the best possible lower bound on the variance .",
    "we note that the numerical results from the next section will confirm the results of fig .",
    "[ ent ] .     for various types of four - mode states containing exactly one excitation ( photon ) .",
    "]    as an example , consider the werner - like mixture of a w state and the maximally mixed state of four modes with a single excitation , @xmath38 using the above criterion for @xmath39 , we find that for @xmath40 we can detect genuine four - mode entanglement , and for @xmath41 we detect at least three - mode entanglement .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath42 , the state @xmath43 is entangled , even if just two - mode entangled .",
    "if the number of modes @xmath0 is arbitrary , then the minimum of @xmath27 for biseparable @xmath44-mode entangled states can be shown , after some algebra , to be given by @xmath45 . in the limit of large @xmath0 , this bound rapidly approaches zero , hence making it practically impossible to distinguish in this way genuine @xmath0-partite entanglement from mere @xmath44-partite entanglement .",
    "finally , we note similar uncertainty - based entanglement criteria can in principle be applied to all types of @xmath0-mode states with some fixed total number of excitations .",
    "if the total photon number is larger than 1 , however , the unitary transformation from product states to a basis consisting of entangled states can in general not be performed with linear optical operations only .",
    "therefore , measurements in such a basis would no longer be deterministic in that case .",
    "due to experimental imperfections , an actual state , produced in a laboratory , is never a pure state with a fixed number of excitations , such as , say , eq .",
    "( [ wbasis1 ] ) . in experiments with atomic ensembles a state @xmath46",
    "is routinely generated whose single - excitation part has a large overlap with a w state , but which contains a significant contribution from the vacuum and from states with more than one excitation . as a conservative estimate , we can ignore coherent superpositions of states with different numbers of excitations [ one can get rid of such coherences by local operations , see @xcite ] , and hence we can write down @xmath46 in a generic form @xmath47 where the subscript indicates the number of excitations .",
    "typically , the magnitude of @xmath48 is of the order of 1% or even less .",
    "the main source of contamination to the desired single - excitation part is the vacuum .",
    "moreover , @xmath22 is not necessarily a pure state , and is not necessarily a state of @xmath0 _ single _ modes either .",
    "even if the uncertainty measure from the preceding section would identify the presence of four - mode entanglement in the state @xmath49 , this does not guarantee that @xmath46 itself carries any entanglement .",
    "the standard counterexample @xcite is a four - mode state of the ( unnormalized ) form @xmath50 for which the one - excitation part is genuinely four - party entangled , although the state itself is fully separable .",
    "therefore , in order to justify the presence of entanglement in an experiment it is not sufficient to measure only the variance @xmath27 of the single - excitation part of the density matrix , but it is crucial to additionally measure the numbers @xmath51 . once @xmath52 and @xmath27 are measured one can check if there exists a completely separable or biseparable state @xmath53 with the same values of @xmath54 . if no such state exists , then one can correctly conclude that @xmath46 is entangled .",
    "more precisely , for fixed values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 we wish to find the minimum possible value for the variance @xmath24 , @xmath57 , consistent with the various sorts of biseparable or fully separable states . in the following",
    "we will plot results for the case where @xmath58 , which is the relevant case for the experiment @xcite .",
    "we will find @xmath57 in that case as a function of @xmath59 .    before discussing in turn the various classes of separable and biseparable states , we make several remarks :",
    "we note that @xmath57 within each such class can not increase with decreasing @xmath56 .",
    "the reason is that given any state @xmath4 we can always mix in the vacuum @xmath60 without changing the variance @xmath24 , and without increasing the entanglement . but this mixing operation clearly does decrease @xmath56 . hence @xmath57 can not increase with decreasing @xmath56 .",
    "similarly , we could mix in a fully separable state containing more than a single photon in some given mode , e.g. , a tensor product of the vacuum and one mode with 2 or more photons .",
    "this again does not affect @xmath24 , and does not increase entanglement , but does decrease @xmath56 .",
    "for this reason , in our attempts to find the minimum variance we do not have to consider states with more than a single photon in any given mode , as those states will have a larger value of @xmath24 than the minimum possible for given @xmath56 .    moreover , we could take a state of @xmath0 single modes and convert it into a state of multiple modes in @xmath0 locations , by locally applying a random unitary operation .",
    "this local operation does not move a state up the entanglement hierarchy and does not affect any of the quantities @xmath24 , @xmath56 and @xmath61 .",
    "thus , excluding fully separable states and biseparable states of @xmath0 _ single _ modes is sufficient for detecting entanglement .",
    "because @xmath22 is subnormalized to @xmath56 , we have , instead of the inequality ( [ bound ] ) , the inequality @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    finally , instead of projecting onto the 4 states ( [ wbasis1])([wbasis4 ] ) , in an experiment one would really project onto 4 states of the form @xmath65 ( which one accomplishes by inserting phase shifters in the appropriate modes ) to find the minimum variance , thus optimizing the entanglement test .",
    "our method is otherwise independent of which values of @xmath66 attain that minimum .",
    "it is relatively easy to account for all separable and biseparable states in the case of four modes .",
    "let us first calculate @xmath54 for fully separable states .",
    "we first consider pure states @xmath67 of the form @xmath68 for complex parameters @xmath69 .",
    "as argued above , we do not have to consider states with more than a single excitation in any one mode .",
    "for the pure state @xmath67 a corresponding density matrix can be constructed from @xmath70 : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73    we can visualize the set of pure completely separable states , and in particular its border , by plotting values of @xmath74 versus @xmath61 for a fixed value of the single - excitation probability @xmath56 , by randomly varying over all values of @xmath69 consistent with that value of @xmath56 . by symmetry , it is clear the minimum variance will be obtained for real parameters .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ wfs ] , and we can clearly identify the region of full separability , the lightly shaded area ( colored in yellow , online ) .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath74 at @xmath75 is @xmath76 which is an agreement with our previous discussion ( see fig .",
    "[ ent ] ) .",
    "it is instructive to point out once again that , even though @xmath74 approaches zero for sufficiently large values of @xmath61 [ see also the last subsection of this section ] , the density matrix @xmath77 is and remains _ fully separable _ [ cf .",
    "the example mentioned above ] .",
    "moreover , we managed to find the pure states living on the pure - state boundary , indicated in black in figure [ wfs ] .",
    "the boundary can be parameterized by two parameters , either @xmath56 and @xmath61 , or , more simply , by @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "namely , the extremum values of the variance for pure fully separable states turns out to be attained for states of the form @xmath80 now one notices the lower border for pure states in figure [ wfs ] is not convex as plotted .",
    "this may indicate that points corresponding to certain mixed states may fall below the pure - state boundary .",
    "thus we have also tested randomly chosen mixtures of random pure states as well as mixtures of states on that boundary .",
    "and some mixed states ( plotted in green ) indeed have a smaller variance .",
    "thus , the minimum variance is attained by mixed states in this case , and the correct lower bound is indicated in red .",
    "this lower bound coincides with the convex hull of the graph for pure states .     of the single - photon part for",
    "randomly chosen , pure , fully separable states versus the probability of finding multiple excitations , @xmath61 for a fixed single - photon probability @xmath81 .",
    "the black crosses are data points for a particular subset of pure states , attaining the extremum values of the variance for the set of pure states . also plotted is the variance for randomly chosen _",
    "mixed _ states ( in green ) . for",
    "this particular value of @xmath56 those values for the variance fall within the convex hull of the graph for pure states ( the red line is the convex hull of the black curve ) .",
    "the region below the lowest red line then corresponds to entangled states ( as indicated by the word ",
    "entanglement \" ) : but this includes two - mode , three - mode and four - mode entanglement . ]      the next class of states to consider is biseparable states i.e. states that can be described by a density matrix @xmath82 .",
    "the division into subsystems a and b in the case of four modes has two distinct possibilities  either system a represents _ one _ of the modes and system b consists of the remaining _ three _ modes or both systems a and b represent _ two _ modes each .",
    "we will study the latter case first .",
    "we represent a pure biseparable state with at most two - mode entanglement by @xmath83 for @xmath84 of the form @xmath85 where we now included phase factors into the parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 . for the same reason",
    "as given in the preceding subsection , we do not have to consider contributions from terms with more than a single excitation in any one mode .",
    "the expression for the variance @xmath24 is symmetric under the interchange of any two modes , and so it is immaterial which two modes constitute system @xmath15 .",
    "we again vary over the complex parameters @xmath88 for fixed value of the single - photon probability @xmath81 to find the set of all pure biseparable states with at most two - mode entanglement , as a function of the multiple - excitation probability @xmath61 . by symmetry",
    "the minimum variance is attained for real coefficients .    the lightly - shaded ( yellow ) area in figure [ w22 ]",
    "then depicts the set containing all biseparable states with at most two - mode entanglement .",
    "indeed , we have checked explicitly that points corresponding to mixed states fall within the shaded region , unlike in the preceding case of fully separable states .",
    "the shaded region of figure [ w22 ] includes that of figure [ wfs ] , simply because the set of fully separable states is a subset of the set of states with at most 2-mode entanglement .",

    "just as in the preceding subsection we find the pure states living on the boundary .",
    "the boundary is again parameterized by two parameters , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "namely , the minimum variance is attained for biseparable states of the form @xmath89 in this case it is straightforward to extract the minimum variance as a function of @xmath56 and @xmath61 : @xmath90 which is indeed almost linear in @xmath61 when @xmath91 . moreover , this boundary is convex .",

    "the amplitude for that path is then @xmath127 in terms of the reflection amplitudes of beamsplitters 1 and 3 .",
    "here we ignore phase factors due to propagation ( they can be trivially inserted in the end ) .",
    "similarly , a photon from input mode 2 can reach the top output mode along just one path , with amplitude @xmath128 .",
    "writing down the amplitudes for photons starting in input modes 3 and 4 shows that a photo - detection at the top output mode projects onto the ( input ) state @xmath129 this is a properly normalized state , even if the beamsplitters are not balanced .",
    "the normalization follows from the relation @xmath130 for lossless beamsplitters .",
    "we can similarly write down the states onto which one projects if detecting a photon in one of the remaining output modes : @xmath131 these states , too , are normalized .",
    "moreover , the 4 states are all orthogonal , as follows from the ( unitarity ) relation @xmath132 one can still calculate the variance of photodetector counts , using the modified projectors onto the @xmath133 states , but that variance will not give as much information as in the balanced case about four - mode entanglement . for example , consider the extreme case of a mirror replacing beamsplitter 4 : that is , assume now that @xmath134 and @xmath135",
    ". then states @xmath136 and @xmath137 are no longer four - mode entangled states , but only two - mode entangled states .",
    "thus , certain two - mode entangle states would give rise to a zero variance in this extreme case .",
    "this implies that even if one s experiment can not use perfect 50/50 beamsplitters , one should at least try to make them as balanced as possible . in such cases one needs in general a lower variance @xmath24 than in the ideal balanced case to conclude one",
    "has four - mode entanglement .      now consider losses .",
    "we can model linear losses ( both propagation losses , and inefficiencies of the photodetectors ) by imagining lossless paths but with additional beamsplitters reflecting away some portion of the light in the lossy paths .",
    "the output of those additional beamsplitters does not lead to the output detectors , but to other ( unmonitored ) output modes .",
    "the overall transformation from input to output is still unitary , which implies there must also be additional input modes ( just as many as there are unmonitored output modes ) .",
    "a photodetection in one of the desired output modes projects onto a set of orthonormal states on the larger hilbert space of all input modes .",
    "if we write down the projections of those states onto the 4 input modes of interest , we will end up with subnormalized states .",
    "for example , considering for the moment ( see the next subsection where we take into account multiple excitations ) only states with exactly one photon , a detection in the top output mode projects onto the state @xmath138 where the transmission amplitude @xmath139 is the product of all loss amplitudes encountered by a photon propagating from input @xmath140 to the top output detector ( this includes the inefficiency of the detector ) .",
    "the variance we are interested in is conditioned on detecting ( at least ) one photon in the desired output modes .",
    "once we detect a photon in the top mode , we do renormalize the state @xmath141 and project onto : @xmath142 for @xmath143 are , therefore , properly normalized , but they are not orthogonal , unless all losses are balanced .",
    "i.e. , if @xmath144 constant for all @xmath145 .",
    "again , we still can use a variance based on the modified nonorthogonal projectors , but that variance will give less information than in the ideal lossless balanced case .",
    "for instance , if all photodetectors but one are completely inefficient and never detect any photon , the variance would be zero for any input state .",
    "thus , in an actual experiment one would have to make the losses as balanced as possible in order for the variance to contain as much information about four - mode entanglement as possible .",
    "of course , one would also like to limit the size of the losses for various different reasons .    with the new projectors onto the nonorthogonal states @xmath146 in hand",
    ", we can perform the same calculations as we did in the ideal case : find the minimum variance consistent with unentangled input states , input states with two - mode entanglement , and input states with three - mode entanglement , respectively , for fixed values of @xmath56 and @xmath61 .",
    "we display three illustrative examples ( for @xmath81 ) : in fig .",
    "[ balance ] we assume no losses but unbalanced beamsplitters , in fig .  [ loss ] we assume losses , but balanced beamsplitters , and in fig .  [ lossbalance ] we show the effects of the combination of both losses and imbalances .",
    "all figures show the tendency of the minimum variance to decrease compared to the ideal lossless and balanced case .                  in the presence of losses",
    "the measured variance , @xmath147 , is not just due to the single - excitation part , but from the multi - excitation part of the input state as well .",
    "thus , the measured variance has to be corrected ( upwards in fact ) in order to find an estimate for the variance @xmath27 due to the single - excitation part , because that is the quantity we used above to detect entanglement .",
    "we discuss a simple case ( balanced losses throughout the system and the use of non - number resolving threshold detectors ) with the same expression for @xmath148 . ] ) where we find we simply have to multiply the measured variance with a factor @xmath149 to obtain an upper bound on @xmath24 .",
    "that is , the variance @xmath24 is upper - bounded by @xmath150 .",
    "we now evaluate @xmath151 .",
    "consider the propagation of the purported experimental state ( here we change notation to make it easier to keep track of the meaning of all symbols ) @xmath152 under balanced losses ( which can be characterized by a single transmission efficiency @xmath153 ) this state transforms to @xmath154 where @xmath155 here , @xmath156 is the 1-photon subspace of @xmath157 originating from the @xmath36-photon @xmath158 subspace of @xmath159 for @xmath160 , and @xmath161 is the 2-photon subspace after the transmission . to the leading order of @xmath161 ( neglecting 3-photon and 4-photon subspaces ) ,",
    "@xmath162 are @xmath163 @xmath164 @xmath165 and @xmath166 is given as @xmath167    thus , if we denote by @xmath168 the normalized probability of the detector ( assumed to be non - number resolving ) in mode @xmath140 finding ( at least ) one photon , then we have @xmath169 where @xmath170 . here , @xmath171 ( @xmath172 )",
    "is the probability of a 1-photon in output mode @xmath140 originating from the 1(2)-photon subspace @xmath49 ( @xmath173 ) , and @xmath174 is the probability of 2-photon in output mode @xmath140 . to be conservative ( for our purposes of finding a _ sufficient _ condition for entanglement ) , we assume that the two photons are directed towards _ one _ detector at a time so that we can not distinguish @xmath171 from @xmath174 . by denoting @xmath175 as the probability of detecting desired events and @xmath176 as the normalized probability of detecting undesired events ( that is , @xmath172 and @xmath174 ) , we get @xmath177 the measured variance @xmath147 is given as @xmath178 on the other hand , the 1-photon variance @xmath24 is defined as @xmath179 as a conservative correction to @xmath180 , we assume that the unwanted events ( @xmath181 ) are all directed towards the output mode @xmath182 which contains the maximum 1-photon probability @xmath183 ( i.e. @xmath184 and @xmath185 for @xmath186 ) .",
    "this way , the measured variance is _ lower _ than the variance @xmath24 .",
    "thus our conservative bound gives then @xmath187 using the inequality @xmath188 , we obtain @xmath189 \\geq q_1 \\delta.\\ ] ] therefore , we obtain a correction factor of @xmath190 where @xmath191 in the limit of @xmath192 , the correction factor becomes @xmath193",
    "we demonstrated how to verify @xmath0-party entanglement of w states or states lying close to w states , in the case quantum information is encoded in the number of excitations per mode .",
    "our method takes into account the presence of the vacuum state , as well as multiple excitations ; moreover , it takes into account losses during the verification measurements , as well as imperfect beamsplitters .",
    "the method applies to any number of modes , but we focused on four modes for illustrative purposes , as the method was applied in an actual experiment @xcite to four modes .",
    "a relatively straightforward set of measurements allows one , in that case , to distinguish genuine four - party entanglement from three - party entanglement , which in turn can be distinguished from two - party entanglement and fully separable states .",
    "one must obtain estimates of three parameters : a variance @xmath24 determined by the single - photon part of the state , the single - photon probability @xmath56 , as well as the multi - photon probability @xmath61 . for example , the simple condition of eq .",
    "( [ p2q ] ) is a necessary condition for genuine four - party entanglement ( where our definition of genuine multi - partite entanglement is more severe than usual ) which involves only @xmath61 and @xmath56 . to obtain sufficient conditions",
    "one must also include the value of @xmath24 in the analysis .",
    "the measurement of @xmath24 combines the various modes by simple beamsplitters , and is thus a nonlocal measurement . in this way",
    "one does _ not _ need local oscillators , which one would need if the entanglement verification method used local measurements only @xcite . in our case",
    "the modes interfere with each other , rather than with external reference beams .",
    "thus , our method can not be applied to eliminate local hidden variable models ( through bell inequalities , for example , in the bi - partite case ) , but it can be applied to verifying entanglement , which is a very different beast indeed @xcite .",
