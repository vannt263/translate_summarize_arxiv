    "@xcite ; a possible link of nuclear gpds measurements to color transparency phenomena has been presented in ref .",
    "one of the main motivations for addressing nuclear gpds measurements is the possibility of distinguishing medium modifications of the structure of bound nucleons from conventional fermi motion and binding effects , a cumbersome separation in data collected through standard dis experiments .",

    "different medium modifications of nucleon gpds have been illustrated in ref .",
    "the possibilities offered by heavy nuclear targets and the effects in nuclear matter are also being investigated @xcite .",

    "@xmath2he is therefore a serious candidate to measure the polarization properties of the free neutron , such as its helicity - flip gpd @xmath18 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been found that the sum of the gpds @xmath12 and @xmath19 , at low momentum transfer , is indeed dominated to a large extent by the neutron contribution , making @xmath2he targets very promising for the extraction of the neutron information . however , this is not the end of the story .",
    "the same analysis has shown in fact that the proton contribution grows fast with increasing the momentum transfer .",
    "besides , even if the neutron contribution to the gpds of @xmath2he were largely dominating , the procedure of extracting the neutron gpds from it could be , in principle , nontrivial . in this paper ,",

    "let us define the following auxiliary function , given simply by the sum of the gpds @xmath46 and @xmath47 for a given target @xmath20 of spin @xmath11 :    @xmath48    this function , due to eq .",

    "a fundamental result is ji s sum rule ( jsr ) @xcite , according to which the forward limit of the second moment of the unpolarized gpds is related to the component , along the quantization axis , of the total angular momentum of the quark @xmath13 in the target @xmath20 , @xmath50 , according to @xmath51 the combination @xmath52 is therefore needed to study the angular momentum content of the nucleon @xmath53 , through the jsr , and oam could be obtained from @xmath50 , being the helicity content measurable in dis and sidis .",
    "the measurement of gpds is therefore very helpful for the understanding of the puzzling spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "the proton data alone do not allow the flavor decomposition of the gpds and therefore , as it happens for any other parton observable , the neutron data are very important .    to obtain the latter , in principle , among the light nuclei , @xmath2he is an ideal target . to understand this fact it is sufficient to realize that , at low @xmath8 , the gpds @xmath1 of protons and neutrons have similar size and opposite sign ( their first moments are @xmath54=1.79 @xmath55 and @xmath56=-1.91 @xmath55 , respectively , being @xmath55 the nuclear magneton ) .",
    "this makes any isoscalar nuclear target , such as @xmath16h or @xmath57he , not suitable for the extraction of the neutron @xmath1 , basically canceled by the proton one , in the coherent channel of dvcs . as a matter of facts ,",
    "the contribution of the proton and neutron gpd @xmath1 to the deuteron gpds has been neglected in the ia calculation presented in ref .",
    "accordingly , in the recent analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite , the contribution of the nucleonic gpd @xmath1 to the angular momentum carried by the quark in the deuteron has been found to be very small , if only conventional nuclear effects are taken into account .    on the contrary , in the @xmath2he case",
    ", gpds are found to be sensitive to the nucleon @xmath18 .",
    "one should in fact notice that @xmath58 , a value rather close to the neutron one , @xmath59 .    as it is well known , @xmath60 and @xmath61 would be equal , i.e. , there would be no proton contribution to @xmath60 , if @xmath2he could be described by an independent particle model with central forces only . of course",
    "this scenario is a rough approximation ; nonetheless , realistic calculations show that the system lies in this configuration with a probability close to 90 % @xcite , allowing a safe extraction of the neutron dis structure functions from @xmath2he data , as suggested in @xcite , estimating effectively nuclear corrections using static properties . here",
    ", the situation is in principle somehow different , because gpds are not densities .",
    "anyway , this scenario is recovered at least in the forward limit , where the jsr holds : static @xmath2he properties can be again advocated .    in a previous rapid communication of ours ,",
    "@xcite , it has been established to what extent , close to the forward limit and slightly beyond it , the measured gpds of @xmath2he are dominated by the neutron ones .",

    "the @xmath62 result , already presented in ref .",

    "one should not forget , we reiterate , that the aim of this analysis , for the moment being , is that of getting a clear estimate of the proton and neutron contributions to the nuclear observable , a feature rather independent on the nucleonic model . to demonstrate this property ,",
    "we have plotted , in fig .",
    "4 , the ratio of the proton to neutron contribution to @xmath93 :    @xmath114    calculated using as input the @xmath115 corresponding to the model of ref . @xcite , and those of the very different models of refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the three ratios are slowly varying as a function of @xmath106 and are very close to each other , demonstrating the very weak model dependence of this feature of the result .",

    "the study of possible modifications , i.e. the study of `` off - shell '' effects , is certainly a relevant issue and it would deserve dedicated investigations , beyond the scope of the present paper .",

    "@xcite for @xmath57he , show that they grow with @xmath8 , being minimal close to the forward limit , where we are proposing the relevant measurement .",
    "in closing this section , let us mention that another process to access the neutron gpds is _ incoherent _ dvcs off the neutron in nuclear targets , i.e. , the process with the struck neutron detected in the final state , in coincidence with the scattered electron and the produced photon .",
    "an experiment of this type will be performed at the 12 gev program of jlab @xcite for a @xmath16h target .",
    "we plan therefore to investigate also incoherent dvcs off the neutron in @xmath2he , although these kind of processes could be spoiled by final state interactions of the detected neutron .",
    "in this work we have thoroughly described an ia calculation of the gpds @xmath42 and @xmath18 of @xmath2he . in proper limits ,",
    "the correct constraints are recovered .",
    "coherent dvcs off @xmath2he at low @xmath8 turns out to be strongly dominated by the neutron contribution , in particular for the @xmath98 flavor , from which the neutron information has to be extracted .",
    "a procedure has been described to take into account the nuclear effects included in the ia analysis and to safely disentangle the neutron information from them , even at moderate values of the momentum transfer .",
    "the only theoretical nuclear ingredients are the neutron and proton contributions to the magnetic point like form factors of @xmath2he , quantities which are under good theoretical control at low momentum transfer and that encode correctly all the nuclear effects described in an ia framework .",
    "if high values of @xmath8 were reached , the ia description would not be reliable and two - body currents and three - body forces would have to be included into the approach .",
    "we have checked that the dominance of the neutron contribution and the proposed extraction procedure do not depend on the model of the nucleon gpd used in the calculation .",
    "our results confirm strongly coherent dvcs off @xmath2he at low momentum transfer as a key experiment to access the neutron gpds .",

    "<S> an impulse approximation ( ia ) analysis is described of the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the @xmath2he nucleus , quantities which are accessible in hard exclusive processes , such as coherent deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation is based on the av18 interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the electromagnetic form factors are correctly recovered in the proper limits . </S>",
    "<S> the sum of the gpds @xmath0 and @xmath1 of @xmath2he , at low momentum transfer , is largely dominated by the neutron contribution , thanks to the unique spin structure of @xmath2he . </S>",
    "<S> this nucleus is therefore very promising for the extraction of the neutron information . by increasing the momentum transfer , </S>",
    "<S> however , this conclusion is somehow hindered by the the fast growing proton contribution . </S>",
    "<S> besides , even when the neutron contribution to the gpds of @xmath2he is largely dominating , the procedure of extracting the neutron gpds from it could be , in principle , nontrivial . </S>",
    "<S> a technique is therefore proposed , independent on both the nuclear potential and the nucleon model used in the calculation , able to take into account the nuclear effects included in the ia analysis and to safely extract the neutron information at values of the momentum transfer large enough to allow the measurements . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to this observation , coherent dvcs should be considered a key experiment to access the neutron gpds and , in turn , the orbital angular momentum of the partons in the neutron . </S>"
