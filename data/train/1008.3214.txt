    "<S> this letter provides a theoretical interpretation of numerically generated probability density functions ( pdfs ) of intermittent plasma transport events . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of ion - temperature - gradient turbulence produce time series of heat flux which exhibit manifestly non - gaussian pdfs with enhanced tails . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that , after the removal of autocorrelations , the numerical pdfs can be matched with predictions from a fluid theoretical setup , based on the instanton method . </S>",
    "<S> this result points to a universality in the modeling of intermittent stochastic process , offering predictive capability .    </S>",
    "<S> stochastic physical processes are most often observed to be unimodal with exponential tails  @xcite , a feature which is also attributed to fluctuations in magnetically confined plasmas  @xcite-  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these fluctuations are intermittent events manifesting a patchy spatial and bursty temporal structure , pertaining to radially propagating coherent structures like blobs or avaloids @xcite , and have been suggested to carry a significant fraction of the total transport @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a comprehensive predictive theory is called for , in order to understand and , subsequently , improve properties related to intermittency </S>",
    "<S> . a major goal would be , for instance , the control of edge heat flux loads , which depend on the instant amplitude of fluctuations , as opposed to the mean load , which can be calculated by quasilinear theory .    in terms of mathematical description , </S>",
    "<S> the likelihood of intermittent events related to plasma turbulence is expressed by probability density functions ( pdfs ) , which usually deviate significantly from the gaussian distribution . along these lines </S>",
    "<S> , there have been attempts to characterize the statistical properties of the pdfs , based on phenomenological premises @xcite or numerical investigations @xcite alone . here </S>",
    "<S> , however , we carry out a direct comparison between first - principles analytical modeling and numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> as will be evident in the sequel , although the two approaches express the same physics , they nevertheless greatly differ in their theoretical backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> a key finding of this work is that the intermittent process in the context of drift - wave turbulence appears to be independent of the specific modeling framework , opening the way to the prediction of its salient features .    </S>",
    "<S> the main part of this letter consists in providing a theoretical interpretation of the pdfs of radial heat flux derived by nonlinear , local , gyrokinetic ( gk ) simulations of drift wave turbulence in tokamaks . </S>",
    "<S> our paradigm in this work is ion - temperature - gradient ( itg ) turbulence with adiabatic electrons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations have been carried out with the gene code  @xcite in a simple large aspect ratio , circular tokamak geometry . in particular , we calculate the turbulent ion radial heat flux , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the radial @xmath2 velocity , @xmath3 the parallel velocity , @xmath4 the magnetic moment , @xmath5 the ion mass , @xmath6 the perturbed ion gyrocenter distribution function and @xmath7 the modulus of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the brackets denote spatial averaging over the entire simulation domain . in order to perform a reliable comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we produce a series of different cases , by varying the magnetic shear @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the safety factor , i.e. , the number of toroidal turns of the magnetic field for each polodal turn ) , which appears both in the gk simulations and the theoretical model . </S>",
    "<S> there is nothing special about the selection of this parameter , and a similar scan could be performed over , for example , the ion temperature or density gradient . here </S>",
    "<S> , we have set the ( normalized ) ion temperature gradient @xmath10 , the density gradient @xmath11 , and the ion - to - electron temperature ratio @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> for each case , the time evolution of the ion heat flux is considered as a time series , to which we apply standard box - jenkins modeling  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this mathematical procedure effectively removes deterministic autocorrelations from the system , allowing for the statistical interpretation of the residual part , which a posteriori turns out to be relevant for comparison with the analytical theory . in our setup </S>",
    "<S> , it turns out that an arima(3,1,0 ) model accurately describes the stochastic procedure , in that , one can express the ( differenced ) heat flux time trace in the form @xmath13 where the fitted coefficients @xmath14 decribe the deterministic component and @xmath15 is the residual part ( noise ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reliability of the produced autoregressive model was routinely verified via portmanteau testing and overfitting .    </S>",
    "<S> it is systematically observed that the residual pdfs are manifestly non - gaussian with elevated tails , as shown for instance in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] , for the case @xmath16 , where the sample residuals from a gene simulation are tested against the gaussian distribution , via a normal quantile - quantile plot . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , two significant statistical quantities , namely the variance @xmath17 and the kurtosis @xmath18 ( here , the brackets denote averaging over the statistical sample ) , during the magnetic shear scan are summarized in table  1 . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , the decrease of the variance and the rapid increase in kurtosis for increasing magnetic shear renders a gaussian description improper . </S>",
    "<S> we note in passing , that the values of @xmath19 were selected such that the resolution of the simulation domain remains constant , thus avoiding numerical artifacts .    in the sequel </S>",
    "<S> , it will be shown that the aforementioned pdf tails can be satisfactorily predicted , starting from a fluid model consisting of a continuity and an energy equation  @xcite , and using a nonperturbative statistical technique , called the instanton method , which has been adopted from quantum field theory and then modified to classical statistical physics for burgers turbulence and in the passive scalar model of kraichnan  @xcite . in this context , </S>",
    "<S> the key element is to identify the bursty or intermittent event with the appearance of a coherent structure ( e.g. , streamer ) .    </S>",
    "<S> .simulation results [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : simulat ]    in the following paragraph , we briefly outline the implementation of the instanton method . for more details , </S>",
    "<S> the reader is referred to the existing literature  @xcite-  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pdf tail is first formally expressed in terms of a path integral by utilizing the gaussian statistics of the forcing in the continuity equation in a similar spirit as in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an optimum path will then be associated with the creation of a modon ( among all possible paths or functional values ) and the action ( @xmath20 , below ) is evaluated using the saddle - point method on the effective action in the limit @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the instanton is localized in time , existing during the formation of the modon . </S>",
    "<S> the saddle - point solution of the dynamical variable @xmath22 of the form @xmath23 is called an instanton if @xmath24 at @xmath25 and @xmath26 at @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> note that , the function @xmath28 here represents the spatial form of the coherent structure . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the intermittent character of the transport consisting of bursty events can be described by the creation of modons . </S>",
    "<S> the probability density function of the heat flux @xmath29 can be defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 here , @xmath32 is the radial drift velocity and @xmath33 the ion temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the integrand can then be rewritten in the form of a path - integral as @xmath34 although @xmath35 appears to be simply a convenient mathematical tool , it does have a useful physical meaning that should be noted ; it arises from the uncertainty in the value of @xmath36 due to the stochastic forcing . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the dynamical system with a stochastic forcing should be extended to a larger space involving this conjugate variable , whereby @xmath36 and @xmath35 constitute an uncertainty relation . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath35 acts as a mediator between the observables ( heat flux ) and instantons ( physical variables ) through stochastic forcing . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ilambda2 ] , the integral in @xmath37 is computed using the saddle - point method where it is shown that the limit @xmath21 corresponds to @xmath38 , representing the tail part of the distribution . </S>",
    "<S> based on the assumption that the total pdf can be characterized by an exponential form , the expression @xmath39 is found  @xcite , where the heat flux @xmath29 plays the role of the stochastic variable , with @xmath40 determining its statistical properties . </S>",
    "<S> several auxiliary definitions are also utilized ; the normalization constant @xmath41 ; the gradient scale lengths @xmath42 ; the normalized modon speed @xmath43 and temperature ratio @xmath44 ; @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the curvature drift frequency and @xmath47 is the diamagnetic drift frequency ; @xmath48 is the perpendicular wave number ; the brackets denote averaging along the field line , e.g. for an arbitrary scalar function @xmath49 , @xmath50 where the eigenfunctions @xmath51 are extracted from the gene simulations and @xmath52 is the mean value of the heat flux . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient @xmath53 is a free parameter and represents the strength of the forcing in the continuity equation . </S>",
    "<S> note that the proposed pdf is close enough to a gaussian distribution to match the bulk of the pdf while retaining the fat tails . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the exponential form of the pdf will be the same for momentum flux with a modified coefficient @xmath54 , which is in agreement with findings in recent experiments  @xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2 ] ( @xmath55 ) , the pdf of heat flux @xmath29 stemming from the _ raw _ timetrace of the simulation ( blue line ) is shown . although a simple visual inspection precludes the gaussian distribution , the analytically predicted instanton method from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pq2 ] ( red line ) does a rather poor job modeling the simulation result . </S>",
    "<S> this is , however , contrasted to the pdf using the weak non - linear model ( dashed - dotted black line ) where reasonably good agreement is found similar to what have been reported earlier  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the weak non - linear model ( a laplace distribution ) is also predicted by the instanton model  @xcite when the non - linearities are neglected and has the form @xmath56 where @xmath54 is determined by the variance . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient @xmath53 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ b ] is determined from the simulations at the point @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure3 ] and [ figure4 ] single out the comparison of the numerically estimated residual pdfs against the instanton prediction in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1 ] . here , the pdf of @xmath58 from the simulation ( blue line ) and the analytically predicted pdf from the instanton method ( dashed - dotted black line ) demonstrate a significantly better agreement both at the tails and the center of the pdf , as compared to the best fit ( using the first two moments ) gaussian distribution ( dashed red line ) at magnetic shears @xmath55 and @xmath59 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> note , we show the weak non - linear model with a value of the variance of 8.00e-4 for better agreement and that the distribution does not capture the form of the stochastic pdf . </S>",
    "<S> the surprisingly good agreement between the gyrokinetic and fluid descriptions of drift wave turbulence strongly suggests a universality of the statistics of the intermittent process .    since the quality of the agreement in the previous figures relies heavily on the exponential coefficient @xmath54 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> 5 , this is displayed for the whole magnetic shear scan in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure5 ] , verifying that good agreement is expected for any value of @xmath19 . here </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the abrupt bending of the curve for larger values of shear is solely attributed to flr effects .    in conclusion , we have presented a first quantitative paradigm of universality in intermittent stochastic processes related to drift wave turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> numerical pdfs of heat flux were generated with the gyrokinetic code gene in the framework of toroidal itg turbulence , and subsequently processed with box - jenkins modeling , in order to remove deterministic autocorrelations , thus retaining their stochastic parts only . </S>",
    "<S> these pdfs have been shown to agree very well with analytical predictions based on a fluid model , on applying the instanton method . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we were able to quantitatively confirm the exponential form of the pdfs , therefore adding the important element of predictive strength to the existing phenomenological approaches .    in future publications we will address the emergent universal scalings of the pdfs of potential , density and temperature where the theory predicts different tails  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a study of potential or density fluctuations opens up opportunities for comparison with experimentally measured pdfs . </S>",
    "<S> still within the scope of itg turbulence , we will include effects from kinetic electrons , in order to test the robustness of the exponential scaling . </S>",
    "<S> a quite interesting complementary work would involve incorporating results from nonlinear fluid simulations , based on braginskii - like equations , and relate them to the already presented findings . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our present setup provides a testbed for the investigation of the impact of zonal flows on the statistics , as reported elsewhere  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> work addressing these avenues has been initiated . </S>"
