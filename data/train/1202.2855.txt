    "classical cepheids are very popular in the recent literature , since they play a crucial role to address several open astrophysical problems .",
    "the reason is threefold .",
    "_ i)_ they are the most popular primary distance indicators , since they are bright and can be easily identified . _ ii)_ they are excellent tracers of intermediate - mass stars , since their evolutionary status is well defined ( central helium burning , blue loops ) .",
    "iii)_ they are fundamental laboratories to constrain the micro ( equation of state , opacity , cross sections ) and macro ( mass loss , mixing , convective transport ) physics adopted in both evolutionary and pulsation models .    dating back to the seminal investigation by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and by @xcite , the evolutionary properties of intermediate - mass have been investigated in a series of theoretical @xcite and empirical @xcite investigations .",
    "one of the most interesting problem concerning evolutionary and pulsation properties of classical cepheids is the so - called mass discrepancy problem . during the late sixties",
    "it was noticed by @xcite and by @xcite that the evolutionary masses estimated using the comparison between isochrones and observations in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd) were almost a factor of two larger than the pulsation masses estimated using the period - mass - radius relation of galactic cepheids @xcite .",
    "this conundrum was partially solved by @xcite using the sets of radiative opacities released by the opal @xcite and by the opacity project @xcite groups .",
    "however , several investigations focussed on galactic @xcite and magellanic @xcite cepheids suggested that such a discrepancy was still of the order of 10 - 20% .",
    "a similar discrepancy was also found by @xcite using dynamical mass estimates of galactic binary cepheids and by @xcite using cluster cepheids located in ngc  1866 , a young large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) cluster .",
    "the cepheid mass discrepancy problem can be addressed following two different paths .",
    "+ _ a ) _ _he - core mass_ current evolutionary predictions underestimate the he - core mass for intermediate - mass structures , and in turn their mass - luminosity ( ml ) ratio .",
    "this possible drawback has a substantial impact both on evolutionary and pulsation predictions , since the latter models assume an ml relation .    _",
    "b ) _ _envelope mass_ current cepheid masses are smaller than their main sequence ( ms ) progenitors , because they have lost a fraction of their initial envelope mass .",
    "the latter working hypothesis implies that the cepheid mass discrepancy is intrinsic , i.e. , it is not caused by limits in the physical assumptions adopted in constructing evolutionary and pulsation models . the input physics adopted in constructing evolutionary models of intermediate - mass stars",
    "has already been addressed in several papers @xcite .    here",
    ", we briefly mention the most relevant ones affecting the he - core mass and the envelope mass .",
    "_ a ) he - core mass _    _ i ) _ extra - mixing several detailed studies based on the comparison between predicted cmds and luminosity functions of ngc1866 , reached opposite conclusions in favor @xcite and against @xcite the occurrence of mild convective core overshooting .",
    "the need for a mild overshooting was also suggested by @xcite who investigated several young clusters in the lmc and in the small magellanic cloud .",
    "more recently , it has also been suggested by @xcite that the degree of overshooting might also depend on the metal abundance , namely it increases when metal abundance decreases . _",
    "ii ) _ rotation evolutionary models constructed by accounting for the effects of rotation predict both an increase in helium core mass and an enhancement in the surface abundance of both helium and nitrogen @xcite . it has also been suggested that rotation might account for the significant changes in surface chemical compositions observed in galactic and magellanic supergiants @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent theoretical @xcite and empirical @xcite investigations indicate that the efficiency of such a mechanism might depend on the initial metal abundance , i.e. , it increases when metal abundance decreases . _",
    "radiative opacity a new set of radiative opacities has been recently computed by the opacity project @xcite .",
    "the difference between old and new opacities is at most of the order of 5 - 10% across the z - bump ( t@xmath7 250,000 k ) . to account for the mass discrepancy",
    "the increase in the opacity should be almost a factor of two .",
    "this indicates that the adopted radiative opacities have a marginal impact on the mass discrepancy problem .",
    "+    _ b ) envelope mass _    _ i ) _ canonical mass loss the total mass of an actual cepheid is also affected by a decrease in the envelope mass .",
    "evolutionary models accounting for the mass loss , during hydrogen and helium burning phases , by means of several semi - empirical relations @xcite do not solve the cepheid mass discrepancy problem .",
    "plausible values for the free parameter @xmath1 give mass loss rates that are too small .",
    "this is not surprising , since current semi - empirical relations are only based on scaling arguments and they are not rooted on a robust physical basis @xcite .",
    "empirical mass loss estimates based on nir and ultraviolet emission for galactic @xcite and large magellanic cloud @xcite cepheids cover a broad range ( 10@xmath8  10@xmath9 m@xmath3 yr@xmath10 ) . _",
    "ii ) _ enhanced mass loss more recent mid - infrared observations for 29 galactic cepheids collected with spitzer indicate the presence of extended emission around seven of them @xcite .",
    "this finding together with the interferometric detection of circumstellar shells around several galactic cepheids @xcite further supports the evidence that there is a wind associated with cepheids possibly triggered by pulsation - driven mass loss .",
    "a new spin concerning the occurrence of circumstellar shells around cepheids was recently given by the detection of a large nebula around @xmath11 cephei @xcite , the protype of cepheid variables .",
    "the ir emission was detected in several mir bands and shows a radial extent larger than @xmath12 au ( 5 arcmin ) .",
    "the nebula shows a parabolic shape and it is aligned with the direction of the motion , thus suggesting the possible occurrence of a bow shock caused by the interaction between the mass - losing cepheid with the interstellar material .",
    "current estimates indicate that @xmath11 cephei may be losing mass with a rate of @xmath135@xmath1410@xmath15 to @xmath136@xmath1410@xmath16 @xmath17 yr@xmath10 .",
    "this finding has been independently confirmed by @xcite using data collected in the radio with the extended very large array .",
    "they found an outflow velocity of @xmath13 36 km / s and a mass loss rate of @xmath13 10@xmath910@xmath18 m@xmath3 yr@xmath10 .",
    "the modest dust content of the outflow indicates that the wind from @xmath11 cephei might be pulsation - driven instead of dust - driven as typical for other classes of evolved stars .    however , the stepping stone concerning the evolutionary and pulsation properties of classical cepheids was the detection of a cepheid in a well detached , double - lined eclipsing binary system in the large magellanic cloud . the geometry and the precision of both photometric and spectroscopic data gave the opportunity to measure the mass of the cepheid ( cep0227 ) with the unprecedented precision of 1% ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter paper i ) .",
    "a similar precision was also attained for the classical cepheid in the lmc eclipsing binary cep1812 by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter paper ii ) .",
    "this finding paved the road for new constraints on pulsation and evolutionary masses .",
    "soon after , @xcite by using evolutionary models that account for a moderate convective core overshooting found evolutionary masses agree quite well with the dynamical mass of cep0227 both in the radius - age plane and in the radius - effective temperature plane .",
    "more recently , @xcite found that a combination of both moderate convective core overshooting and pulsation - driven mass loss is required to solve the cepheid mass discrepancy .    this is the third paper of a series focussed on the evolutionary and pulsation properties of cepheids .",
    "the new series present two novel approaches when compared with similar investigations available in the literature : _ i)_ the intrinsic parameters will be estimated using a bayesian approach in dealing with the comparison between theory and observations ; _ ii)_ the empirical measurements are based on a homogeneous approach for both photometry and spectroscopy . in this investigation",
    "we provide new evolutionary constraints on the binary cepheid cep0227 .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in ",
    "2 we introduce the input physics adopted to construct evolutionary models . we also discuss the physical assumptions adopted to deal with mass loss , mixing and convective transport . in this section , we also outline the assumptions adopted to compute stellar isochrones .",
    "the description of the method adopted to estimate the intrinsic parameters of the binary components is given in  3 . in this section",
    "we discuss the different most probable solutions in the l ",
    "t , in the m ",
    "r and in the g  t planes .",
    " 4 deals with the new empirical constraints on both stellar mass and age we obtained in the different planes for the binary system . in  5",
    "we address the comparison between the most probable stellar isochrone and observations in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the true distance modulus and the reddening for the combined system are also discussed . in ",
    "6 we summarize the results and outline future possible avenues of the project .",
    "the evolutionary tracks were computed with an updated version of the franec evolutionary code @xcite . for these models ,",
    "the 2006 release of the opal equation of state ( eos ) was adopted @xcite , together with the radiative opacity tables released in 2005 by the same livermore group @xcite for @xmath19 > 4.5 $ ] and extended at lower temperatures with the radiative opacity tables by @xcite .",
    "the conductive opacities are from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "all the opacity tables were calculated for the ( * ? ? ? * hereafter as09 ) heavy - element solar mixture .",
    "the nuclear reaction rates are from the nacre compilation @xcite , except for the @xmath20n(p,@xmath21)@xmath22o , which is from the luna collaboration @xcite and @xmath23c(@xmath24,@xmath21)@xmath25o from @xcite .",
    "these two reactions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) affect both the extension and the morphology of the loop performed by intermediate - mass he - burning stars in the hr diagram . hence the most recent values should always be adopted in stellar evolutionary codes in order to provide reliable theoretical predictions .",
    "current calculations did not take into account he and metal diffusion , since its effect on the evolutionary properties of intermediate - mass stars is minimal . to model super - adiabatic convection",
    ", we adopted the mixing - length formalism @xcite , in which the efficiency of the convective transport depends on the mixing - length , i.e. @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the pressure height - scale and @xmath24 is a free parameter .",
    "the @xmath24 value 1.74 was calibrated using the standard solar models computed with both the same code and the same input physics , in particular using the same heavy - element mixture ( as09 ) , to account for current theoretical and empirical uncertainties , additional models with @xmath24=1.9 were also computed",
    ". we also account for convective core overshooting , during central hydrogen burning phases , by extending the central mixed region of @xmath28=@xmath29 from the border of the standard convective core defined by the schwarzschild criterion , where @xmath30 is a free parameter @xcite .",
    "note that we do not account for a mechanical core overshooting during the central he - burning phase .",
    "the use of the schwarzschild criterion to determine the convective core extension , during these phases , would lead to an unphysical discontinuity in the radiative gradient at the border of the convective core .",
    "this effect is caused by the increase in the opacity due to the conversion of he into c and o @xcite . to overcome the problem we model the growth of the convective core and the development of a semiconvective region following @xcite .",
    "note that we neglect the convective overshooting at the base of the convective envelope during shell hydrogen burning phases .",
    "[ plotp ]     [ fig : ploiso ]      the approach we plan to adopt to estimate the intrinsic parameters of the binary components does require detailed set of evolutionary tracks and of isochrones properly covering the helium burning phases .",
    "the stellar masses of the evolutionary tracks range from 3 to 5 @xmath17 , and the step in stellar mass is 0.05 @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , each set includes 42 evolutionary tracks .",
    "unfortunately , we still lack an accurate measurement of the iron and heavy element abundances of cep0227 .",
    "therefore , we adopted the mean metallicity of lmc cepheids ( [ fe / h]=-0.33@xmath310.13 dex ) based on recent high - resolution , high signal - to - noise spectra collected with uves at eso / vlt @xcite .",
    "the top , left panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the set of evolutionary models computed at fixed helium ( y=0.260 ) and metal ( z=0.006 ) content and stellar masses ranging from 3 to 5 @xmath17 .",
    "the evolutionary phases plotted in this panel cover the central helium burning evolutionary phases ( blue loops ) .    to take into account possible changes in iron abundance , due to intrinsic metallicity dispersion @xcite we also computed four independent sets of evolutionary tracks with metallicity ranging from z=0.004 to z=0.008 , while the helium content was fixed assuming an helium - to - metal enrichment ratio @xmath32/@xmath33=2 @xcite and a primordial helium abundance of @xmath34=0.2485 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , current helium values range from y=0.256 to y=0.265 ( see top , right panel of fig .  1 ) .",
    "we already mentioned that intermediate - mass stars are affected by uncertainties on the actual size of the he - core mass .",
    "to constrain the impact of the convective core overshooting during central hydrogen burning phases on the intrinsic parameters , the evolutionary tracks were computed either neglecting ( @xmath0=0 ) or accounting for a moderate convective core overshooting ( @xmath0=0.2 , see top panels of fig .  1 ) .",
    "the two components of the binary system are relatively cool objects ( see table  1 ) with extended convective envelopes . to constrain the dependence on the efficiency of convective transport in the super - adiabatic regions the calculations",
    "were performed assuming two different mixing length parameters .",
    "the former one @xmath24=1.74 calibrated using the standard solar model @xcite and the latter one @xmath24=1.90 to mimic a more efficient convection ( see middle panels of fig .  1 ) .",
    "recent theoretical investigations based on evolutionary models accounting for both convective core overshooting and for a pulsation driven mass loss suggested that the latter physical mechanism can play a crucial role in settling the cepheid mass discrepancy problem @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the dependence of the blue loops on this physical mechanism is out of the aim of this investigation .",
    "however , to constrain the dependence of the most probable solution on the mass loss rate , different sets of evolutionary models were computed accounting for mass loss after the central hydrogen exhaustion .",
    "we used the reimers formula    @xmath35 = @xmath1 @xmath144 @xmath14 @xmath36 @xmath14 l / gr  [ @xmath17/yr ] where @xmath1 is a free parameter , l , r and g are the luminosity , the radius , and the surface gravity in solar units",
    ". sets of models with four different @xmath1 values , namely 0 , 0.4 , 0.8 and 4.0 , were computed .",
    "the evolutionary tracks constructed by assuming @xmath1=0.4 and 0.8 show marginal changes and in the following we will only take into account the former ones ( see bottom panels of fig .  1 ) .",
    "we ended up with a sample of more than 2,000 evolutionary tracks computed for this specific project .      for each set of evolutionary tracks discussed in  2.2",
    ", we also computed a fine grid of stellar isochrones with ages ranging from a few tens to a few hundreds of myr .",
    "to improve the accuracy of the parameter estimates ( see  [ sec : parest ] ) and to provide robust determinations of the confidence interval , the isochrones were further interpolated .",
    "the actual grid of isochrones has a step in age of 0.02 myr , necessary to cover the fast evolution of the stars across the blue loop .",
    "subsets of isochrones for selected input parameters ( see labeled values ) in the hr diagram are shown in fig.[fig : ploiso ] .",
    "the parameters that determine the evolutionary status of a star are its mass , @xmath37 , its age , @xmath38 and its chemical composition , @xmath39 .",
    "the value of these parameters determine the position of a star in the hr diagram or , similarly , in any diagram were observable properties are displayed .",
    "stellar models predict observables as a function of these three parameters , hence their values can be estimated by comparing predictions and observations . to provide robust estimates of both stellar masses and ages of the binary components we followed the bayesian approach described in @xcite .",
    "the interested reader is referred to the quoted paper , here we only summarize the relevant points of the approach we adopted .",
    "given a set of observables @xmath40 the probability of the model parameters , @xmath41 is given by :    @xmath42    here @xmath43 is the likelihood of the parameters @xmath44 given the set of observations @xmath40 and @xmath45 is the prior distribution of the parameters .",
    "we used three different pairs of observables , @xmath40 , to determine the @xmath46 set of parameters of the binary components .",
    "in particular , we performed the comparison in the @xmath47 and @xmath48 planes .    to estimate the best values of the stellar masses and ages",
    "the probability @xmath49 is marginalized w.r.t the other two variables : @xmath50    the mode of the marginal distributions is used as the best parameter estimator @xcite .",
    "confidence intervals are defined by excluding 16% of the area under the posterior distribution on each side of the variable domains .    in our treatment the metallicity",
    "is not considered as an unknown parameter to be determined . on the contrary",
    ", we adopted the available prior information on the metallicity of cepheids in the lmc to constrain our predictions on the stellar masses and ages . in detail , we adopted a gaussian distribution of [ fe / h ] with mean @xmath51 } > = -0.33 $ ] and standard deviation @xmath52 } } = 0.13 $ ] dex .",
    "the quoted values are based on the metallicity distribution of lmc cepheids measured by @xcite .",
    "given the available information on the dynamical stellar masses we adopted two different priors for the stellar mass . in one case a flat prior is adopted , defined across the entire range of stellar masses for which we computed evolutionary tracks : @xmath53m_{\\odot}$ ] . in the second case we used a prior with a gaussian distribution with mean and standard deviations based on the dynamical mass estimates by @xcite .",
    "stellar ages were estimated separately for the two binary components and for the system as a whole .",
    "the age of each star is determined from the @xmath54 marginal distribution of equation ( [ eq : gtau ] ) . in the reasonable hypothesis",
    "that the two components of the binary system have the same age , their composite age distribution , i.e. the age of the system , can be simply derived as : @xmath55 where the subscripts indicate the composite ( c ) , the primary component ( p ) and the secondary component ( s ) age distributions . in a recent investigation",
    ", @xcite showed that the age distribution of a stellar system based on this approach is a more precise indicator of the real age when compared to single stellar ages .",
    "the above approach was applied to each set of evolutionary models listed in table  1 , i.e. for each different assumption concerning the value of the overshooting parameter @xmath30 the mass - loss @xmath1 and the mixing length @xmath24 parameter .",
    "the posterior probabilities were computed using both the flat and the gaussian prior on the stellar mass . selected results of the individual solutions",
    "are given in table  3 .",
    "the solutions based on different observables are discussed in the following subsections .      as a first step to constrain the intrinsic parameters of the binary system",
    ", we applied our method in the hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "the main advantage in using this plane is that we can estimate the intrinsic luminosities using the stefan - boltzmann relation .",
    "therefore , the solution is independent of distance modulus , reddening and stellar mass .",
    "the main drawback is that the two parameters ( luminosity and temperature ) are correlated and more affected by measurement errors than the stellar mass and the radius ( see fig .",
    "however , our method takes into account the fact that temperature and luminosity are not independent , and indeed the covariance matrix is also included in the solution ( see equations ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "[ plotp ]    .      to further constrain the intrinsic parameters of the binary system we also applied the bayesian method in the stellar mass vs radius plane .",
    "the main advantage in using this plane is that the adopted observables are independent of distance modulus and reddening and they are also independent from each other ( see fig .  4 ) .",
    "[ plotp ]       [ plotp ]    .",
    "finally , we applied the bayesian method also into the effective temperature vs surface gravity plane .",
    "the main advantage in using this plane is that the adopted observables are independent of distance modulus and reddening .",
    "moreover , the observables are independent from each other and the isochrones display a relevant difference in this age range ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "this plane combines three independent measurements , thus providing the most stringent test for the theory .",
    "the most probable mass and age values that we found indicate that the mixing length parameter has a minimal impact on the estimate of these parameters .",
    "this result is not surprising , since the extent in effective temperature of the blue loop is minimally affected by the change in @xmath24 from 1.74 to 1.90 .",
    "this is the reason why in table  3 we only included the results based on models with @xmath24=1.74 .",
    "what is clear from the values listed in table  3 is that the solutions based on evolutionary models that do not account for the convective core overshooting and those with enhanced mass - loss ( @xmath58 ) are in worse agreement with the measured dynamical masses , when compared with the results based on models accounting for the convective core overshooting and @xmath59 or 0.4 .    in the case of a flat mass prior ,",
    "the @xmath60 models predict stellar masses that are systematically larger than observed , even though the difference with the dynamical mass is typically within the 1@xmath61 confidence interval .",
    "similarly , the models with enhanced mass - loss , in the case of flat mass prior , tend to underestimate the mass of the primary component .",
    "these two sets of models give a good agreement with the data , only when the method is used in the m ",
    "r plane .    comparing the results for a flat and a gaussian mass prior",
    ", it is clear that the latter drives the solution towards the measured dynamical mass .",
    "while this might appear obvious , we will show in sect .",
    "[ sec : bf ] that not only the mode of the mass distributions are shifted towards the measured values , but also the whole solution has a higher reliability , measured using the so - called @xmath62 parameter ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "the impact of the gaussian prior is very important also for the age results . in the gaussian mass prior case ,",
    "the age solutions for the two components are generally more precise , meaning that the uncertainty interval is narrower compared to the flat prior case .",
    "in addition to this , there is also a better agreement between the ages of the two components , and therefore , a more robust result for the composite age of the system .    for each set of models , we plotted the isochrones corresponding to the most probable composite age ( indicated by a c in table  3 ) in figs .  3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "the three figures show the most probable isochrone as obtained by applying the method in the l ",
    "t , in the m ",
    "r and in the g ",
    "solid and dashed lines display the most probable ages for a flat and a gaussian mass prior , respectively .",
    "in passing , we note that evolutionary models constructed assuming a slightly enhanced mass loss rate ( @xmath1=0.8 ) also provide very similar solutions to the canonical ( @xmath1=0.4 ) case .",
    "this indicates that canonical recipes to account for mass loss rate do not allow us to provide more quantitative constraints on mass loss efficiency during advanced evolutionary phases @xcite .",
    "however , a detailed treatment of the pulsation - driven mass loss inside the instability strip is out of the aim of this investigation .",
    "the confidence intervals of the different solutions provide a hint concerning the robustness of individual fits using the different observables .",
    "however the precision of the result alone migth be a deceptive indicator of the goodness of the fit between theory and data . a narrower confidence interval in the @xmath64 parameter space",
    "does not necessarily imply that the corresponding choice either of the observables , or of the mass prior or of the set of models is better than other possible choices .",
    "a quantitative measurement of the relative goodness of the different solutions can be provided by the bayes factor .",
    "the bayes factor , @xmath65 , between two sets of models is defined as the ratio of the @xmath62 of the two models .",
    "the @xmath62 itself is the integral of the likelihood , marginalized over the model parameters prior distribution ( see ,",
    "e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath62 gives the total probability of the observed data given the particular set of models considered . since our sets of models differ for the choice of the mixing length parameter , @xmath24 , the core overshooting parameter , @xmath30 , and the mass - loss parameter , @xmath1 , we introduce @xmath66 to identify a particular choice of the three parameters .",
    "the @xmath62 is therefore : @xmath67    the @xmath62 depends on the plane in which the comparison between data and models is performed ( l  t , m ",
    "t ) , on the choice of the prior distribution of the model parameters ( i.e. , @xmath68 , in our case flat or gaussian mass distribution and gaussian metallicity distribution ) and on the @xmath69-set of parameters identifying that set of models ( see fig .",
    "@xmath70 is proportional to the total probability of observing the data @xmath40 under the assumption that the @xmath71 model is the correct model .    in equation ( [ eq : evid ] )",
    "the @xmath40 observables refer to a single star .",
    "the composite @xmath62 for both stars is simply : @xmath72    from equation ( [ eq : evid ] ) , it follows that the bayes factor is : @xmath73    the bayes factor does not constrain the triplet @xmath74 that provides the highest posterior probability for each set of models .",
    "however , it can be used to quantify which set of models , variable plane and prior distribution choice give the best overall agreement with the data . typically , in order to claim that a set is preferred over another",
    ", the bayes factor should be smaller / larger than one , with either bf @xmath75 or bf @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "table  4 gives the bf values using as a reference the set of models with @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , together with the variables @xmath80 and with the gaussian mass prior distribution .",
    "this reference set gives the largest @xmath62 for the composite system , therefore it can be considered within our range of models the best set of models and the best prior distribution choice to describe the observations .",
    "the bfs listed in table  4 were estimated by dividing the corresponding @xmath62 by the @xmath62 of the reference set either for the primary star ( p entries ) , or for the secondary star ( s entries ) or for the composite @xmath62 ( c entries ) .",
    "the ( @xmath81 ) set of models gives bfs for the primary ( see fig .",
    "6 ) , the secondary ( see fig .  7 ) and the composite system that are very similar to the reference set .",
    "therefore , these two sets give similar likely solutions and with the present data we can not distinguish between them . on the contrary , the set without overshooting , @xmath82 , and the set with enhanced mass - loss rate , @xmath58 , show very low values of the bfs , suggesting that these parameters can be excluded , hence , confirming the qualitative analysis at the beginning of this section .",
    "it is worth noticing that , the bfs for a given @xmath40 plane and a given @xmath69 set are generally larger when the gaussian mass prior is used .",
    "this suggests that the likelihoods themselves are already centered in a region of the parameter space which is close to the dynamical mass measurements .",
    "therefore , the gaussian prior enhances the posterior probabilities when compared with the flat case .",
    "this finding is also supported by the fact that several solutions obtained using a flat mass prior distribution are characterized by large confidence intervals ( see top panels in figs .  6 and 7 and the values listed in table  3 ) .",
    "in addition to this , the plane in which the largest bfs are found is the g ",
    "this means that the models , when the measurements of stellar mass , radius and effective temperature are combined , are still able to reproduce these three independent observables , and actually the total probability increases .    @xmath83{f6_ia.eps } &   \\includegraphics[width=0.32\\textwidth]{f6_ib.eps } &   \\includegraphics[width=0.32\\textwidth]{f6_ic.eps } \\\\",

    "the reason is twofold .",
    "the difference between the estimated masses and the dynamical masses , taken at face value , do agree at the 1% level .",
    "we are assuming a very crude approximation to account for the mass loss , while current empirical and theoretical findings indicate that the mass loss might be driven by the pulsation instability @xcite .",

    "they found that the observed period change of polaris implies a mass loss rate of @xmath7 10@xmath18 m@xmath3 yr@xmath10 , and in turn a new firm empirical argument for enhanced mass loss in cepheids .",
    "the above discussion concerning the formal precision of the results relies on the width of the confidence interval .",
