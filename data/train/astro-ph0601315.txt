    "high galactic latitude molecular clouds ( hereafter hlcs ) are typically located at @xmath17b@xmath17 @xmath18 20@xmath430@xmath4 . since the gaussiun scale height of co",
    "is estimated to be @xmath3 100 pc in the inner galactic disk ( e.g. , magnani et al .",
    "2000 ) , hlcs are likely located very close to the sun , within a few hundred pc or less .",
    "their proximity to the sun and the low possibility of overlapping with other objects along the line of sight enable us to study them with a high spatial resolution and to compare co data unambiguously with the data at other wavelengths .",
    "hlcs have lower molecular densities compared with dark clouds where the optical obscuration is significant . therefore , hlcs are often called as translucent clouds ( e.g. , van dishoeck & black 1988 ) and most of the known hlcs are not the sites of active star formation , although a few of them are known to be associated with t tauri stars ( e.g. , magnani et al . 1995 ; pound 1996 ; hearty et al .",
    "1999 ) .    given the very small distances of hlcs , it is a challenging task for observers to make a complete survey for hlcs over a significant portion of the whole sky . @xmath6co",
    "( @xmath7 = 10 ) emission has been used to search for hlcs because the line emission in the mm band is strongest among the thermally or sub - thermally excited spectral lines of interstellar molecular species .",
    "it is however difficult to cover an area as large as tens of square degrees subtended by some of the hlcs because of the general weakness of the @xmath6co emission , typically @xmath3 a few k ( e.g. , magnani et al . 1996 ) , with existing mm - wave telescopes in a reasonable time scale .",
    "hlcs have been therefore searched for by employing various large - scale datasets at other wavelengths including the optical obscuration ( magnani et al .",
    "1985 ; keto & myers 1986 ) , the infrared radiation ( reach et al . 1994 ) , and the far - infrared excess over hi ( = fir excess)(blitz et al . 1990 ; onishi et al .",
    "2001 ) . on the other hand , unbiased surveys in co at high galactic latitudes have been performed at very coarse grid separations of 1@xmath4 resulting in a small sampling factor of a few % ( hartmann et al . 1998 ; magnani et al .",
    "most recently , onishi et al . ( 2001 ) discovered 32 hlcs or hlc complexes .",
    "this search was made based on the fir excess , demonstrating the correlation among fir excess clouds with co clouds is a useful indicator of co hlcs .",
    "previous co observations of individual hlcs at higher angular resolutions show that hlcs exhibit often loop - like or shell - like distributions having filamentary features with widths of several arc min or less ( hartmann et al .",
    "1998 ; magnani et al . 2000",
    "; bhatt 2000 ) , and in addition that hlcs often compose a group , whose angular extent is @xmath3 10 degrees or larger . in order to better understand the structure of hlcs and to pursue the evolution of hlc complexes , co",
    "observations covering tens of square degrees at a high angular resolution are therefore crucial .",
    "the past observations of such complexes of hlcs are limited to a few regions including polaris flare ( heithausen & thaddeus 1990 ) , ursa major ( pound & goodman 1997 ) and the hlc complex toward mbm 53 , 54 , and 55 ( yamamoto et al .",
    "pound & goodman ( 1997 ) showed an arc - like structure of the molecular cloud system and suggested that the origin of such structures could be some explosive events .",
    "most recently , yamamoto et al . ( 2003 ) carried out extensive observations of the molecular cloud complex including mbm 53 , 54 , and 55 and suggest that the hlcs may be significantly affected by past explosive events based on the arc - like morphologies of molecular hydrogen ( see also gir et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the region of mbm 53 , 54 , and 55 is of particular interest among the three , because it is associated with a large hi cloud of @xmath3 590 @xmath10 at a latitude of @xmath535 degrees and because there is a newly discovered hlc of 330@xmath10 , hlcg92@xmath535 , which is significantly hi rich with a mass ratio @xmath15(h@xmath11)/@xmath15(hi ) of @xmath3 1 , among the known hlcs ( yamamoto et al .",
    "this cloud was in fact missed in the previous surveys based on optical extinction ( magnani et al .",

    "it is of considerable interest to pursue the physical states of these scs from view points of cloud physics and chemistry as well as of the origin of molecular clouds .",
    "we shall hereafter focus on the low mass @xmath6co clouds whose mass is less than 1 @xmath10 .",

    "we note that we ignore the possible contribution of atomic hydrogen in the above relationship .",
    "if we take into account the distribution of atomic hydrogen as @xmath37(hi ) , the visual extinction would increase by 0.2 @xmath3 0.3 mag .",
    "this may be explained as that the @xmath9co emitting regions become significant when @xmath14v becomes larger than @xmath3 1 mag , marginally enough to shield the ultraviolet radiation to protect @xmath9co molecules ( e.g. , warin et al .",
    "1996 ) , although @xmath9co molecules may be also affected from the ultraviolet radiation because the @xmath84 derived from @xmath9co is lower than that derived from @xmath6co in most of molecular clouds .",
    "the peak intensity ratio of @xmath6co and @xmath9co is around 5 , much smaller than the terrestrial abundance ratio of 89 , indicating that the @xmath6co emission is optically thick in the clouds where the both emissions are detected .",
    "the maximum @xmath6co peak temperature of the present brightest @xmath6co emission is 6 k , and this suggests that the excitation temperature is consistent with the kinetic temperature of @xmath3 10 k , typical to the local dark clouds .",
    "the low mass clouds show lower @xmath6co peak temperatures down to 1 k , significantly less than the brightest peak intensities .",
    "it is not clear if this is due to the lower excitation temperatures or due to smaller filling factors significantly less than 1 . in order to clarify this point",
    "we need observations of the present low mass clouds at much higher angular resolutions .",
    "figure 13 shows the histograms of mass and sizes of @xmath6co clouds . in the present region , we have detected a large number of molecular clouds of mass less than 0.1 @xmath10 and sizes less than 0.1 pc not detected so far in the other regions .",
    "we may ask why molecular clouds of mass less than 0.1 @xmath10 and size less than 0.1 pc such as the present clouds have not been detected so far .",
    "the main reason for this is perhaps the paucity of high - resolution observational studies of nearby molecular clouds .",
    "most of the observations of the local high latitude clouds were made at lower resolutions of 10 arc - min or at a coarse grid spacing of 1 degree , both of which are unable to detect and resolve the present low mass clouds .",
    "this suggests that the low mass clouds similar to the present ones may not be uncommon in the interstellar space and warrant more extensive searches for them in the other parts of the sky .",
    "it is interesting to compare the physical parameters of the present vscs with theoretical studies .",
    "the typical size of these hlcs , @xmath3 0.1 pc , is significantly less than the jeans length of 1.3 pc  7 pc for molecular gas with @xmath85=10 k and @xmath86(h@xmath11)=10100 @xmath87 .",
    "if we take temperature higher than 10 k , the length becomes even larger .",
    "figure 14 shows the radial distribution of mass surface density which is derived by dividing the mass in circular annulus of a radius by the area of the circular annulus . mass surface density in the present region",
    "is fairly flat in radius because there is no massive molecular cloud in the center of the vscs . on the other hand , mass surface density in the other regions",
    "has a gradient for radius , indicating that there are small molecular clouds around a massive molecular cloud whose mass is several dozen @xmath10 or greater ( e.g. , sakamoto 2002 , sakamoto & sunada 2003 ) .    in these regions ,",
    "the gravity of the massive molecular cloud may contribure to the formation of these small clouds by increasing the pressure in the surroundings .",
    "these suggest that mechanisms other than gravitational instability might contribute to the formation of present vscs . a theory of molcular cloud formation is discussed by koyama & inutsuka ( 2002 ) .",
    "according to them , molecular clouds smaller than the jeans - length can be formed in the shocked layer through the thermal instability .",
    "we shall present some considerations by comparing the observational results with their theoretical results .",
    "present vscs are likely to be affected by hd886 in the last few @xmath010@xmath79 yr ( for details , see section 5.2 ) .",
    "although the mechanical luminosity from hd886 injected to the loop - like structure during a few @xmath010@xmath79 yr is low to explain the expanding of the interstellar matter , it is a possibility that the stellar wind of hd886 is the source of shock .",
    "koyama & inutsuka ( 2002 ) assumed shock velocity of 26 km s@xmath20 and density of 0.6 @xmath87 as an initial pre - shock condition and find that the region of density greater than 100 @xmath87 grows in size to @xmath3 0.2 pc @xmath0 0.1 pc in 1.06@xmath010@xmath79 yr and the internal structure consists of some filaments .",
    "the velocity dispersion of co derived by koyama & inutsuka ( 2002 ) is a few km s@xmath20 .",
    "the size of the smallest molecular clouds and the velocity dispersion of co are comparable to those derived from koyama & inutsuka ( 2002 )",
    ". we can not resolve the internal structure of the vscs because the present vscs are detected with only a few points for each .",
    "the typical column density derived by koyama & inutsuka ( 2002 ) is 2@xmath010@xmath12 @xmath13 , while the column density of the vscs is estimated to be @xmath3 1.6@xmath010@xmath12 @xmath13 ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the surface filling factor of the region of density greater than 100 @xmath87 in koyama & inutsuka ( 2002 ) is roughly estimated to be 3040% . in this surface filling factor",
    "the column density estimated from the observations is consistent with that derived from koyama & inutsuka ( 2002 ) and the low temperature of the vscs is consistent with the result that their peak temperature is lower than that of the typical local dark clouds .",
    "these results indicate a potential that the present vscs are formed in the shock compressed layer through thermal instability . in order to compare the observational results with the theoretical simulation on internal temperature and density structure in more details ,",
    "the observations of higher resolutions are needed .",

    "we performed @xmath9co observations in and around the whole area where the peak temperature of @xmath6co is more than 2.0 k. we identified 33 @xmath9co clouds and derived physical properties under the assumption of lte .",

    "these spectral indices are similar to those derived in the other regions .",

    "this index is slightly different from the indices in the other regions although the tendency that molecular clouds are more vilialized as the mass increases is consistent with the other regions .",
    "there is no sign of star formation from the comparison of iras point sources and point source catalog of two - micron all - sky survey in the present region .",
