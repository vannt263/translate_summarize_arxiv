    "the hera results have aided our understanding of the parton distribution functions in new kinematic regimes and have led to different high energy extrapolations of the ultrahigh energy neutrino cross section than what was done earlier .",
    "we review the evaluation of the neutrino - nucleon cross section and summarize the consequences of hera results for the small @xmath2 region of the parton distribution functions , and therefore , for the ultrahigh energy neutrino cross section .",
