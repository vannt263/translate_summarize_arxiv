    "measurements of the polarization dependent structure function , @xmath7 , in deep inelastic scattering @xcite have inspired considerable experimental and theoretical effort to understand the spin structure of baryons .",
    "while most of these studies concern the spin structure of the nucleons , it has become clear that similar measurements involving other baryons would provide helpful , complementary information @xcite .",
    "the lambda baryon plays a special role in this respect .",
    "it is an ideal testing ground for spin studies since it has a rather simple spin structure in the naive quark parton model .",
    "furthermore , its self - analyzing decay makes polarization measurements experimentally feasible .",
    "forthcoming experiments at rhic could measure the polarization of lambda hyperons produced in proton - proton collisions with one of the protons longitudinally polarized , @xmath8 .",
    "the polarization dependent fragmentation function of quarks and gluons into lambda hyperons can be extracted from such experiments .",
    "these fragmentation functions contain information on how the spin of the polarized quarks and gluons is transferred to the final state lambda .",
    "the advantage of proton proton collisions , as opposed to @xmath9 annihilation , where @xmath3 production and polarization is dominated by strange quark fragmentation , is that lambdas at large positive rapidity are mainly fragmentation products of up and down valence quarks of the polarized projectile .",
    "thus , the important question , intimately related to our understanding of the spin structure of baryons , of whether polarized up and down quarks can transfer polarization to the lambda can be tested at rhic @xcite .    in a previous publication",
    ", we have shown that the hyperfine interaction , responsible for the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath5-@xmath3 mass splittings leads to non - zero polarized non - strange quark fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "these non - zero polarized up and down quark fragmentation functions give rise to sizeable _ positive _ @xmath3 polarization in experiments where the strange quark fragmentation is suppressed . on the other hand ,",
    "predictions based either on the naive quark model or on @xmath4 flavor symmetry predict _ zero _ or _ negative _ lambda polarization @xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we briefly discuss fragmentation functions and show how the hyperfine interaction leads to polarized non - strange fragmentation functions .",
    "we fix the parameters of the model by fitting the data on @xmath3 production in @xmath9 annihilation . in section iii",
    ", we discuss @xmath3 production in pp collisons at rhic energies .",
    "we point out that the production of @xmath3 s at high rapidities is dominated by the fragmentation of valence up and down quarks of the polarized projectile , and is ideally suited to test whether non - strange quarks transfer their polarization to the final state @xmath3 .",
    "we predict significant positive @xmath3-polarization at large rapidities of the produced @xmath3 .",
    "fragmentation functions can be defined as light - cone fourier transforms of matrix elements of quark operators @xcite @xmath10 where , @xmath11 is the appropriate dirac matrix ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 refer to the momentum of the produced @xmath3 and of the intermediate system @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the spin of the lambda and the plus projections of the momenta are defined by @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the plus momentum fraction of the quark carried by the produced @xmath3 .    translating the matrix elements , using the integral representation of the delta function and projecting out the light - cone plus and helicity @xmath18 components we obtain @xmath19          | \\langle 0|\\psi_{+}^{\\pm } ( 0 )    \\label{frag2}\\ ] ] here , @xmath20 , and we have defined @xmath21 . the fragmentation function of an anti - quark into a @xmath3 is given by eq .",
    "( [ frag2 ] ) , with @xmath22 replaced by @xmath23 : @xmath24          | \\langle 0|\\psi_{+}^{\\dagger\\pm } ( 0 )    \\label{frag3}\\ ] ] @xmath25 can be interpreted as the probability that a quark with positive / negative helicity fragments into a @xmath3 with positive helicity and similarly for antiquarks .",
    "the operator @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) either destroys a quark ( an antiquark ) or it creates an antiquark ( quark ) when acting on the @xmath3 on the right hand side in the matrix elements .",
    "thus , whereas , in the case of quark fragmentation , the intermediate state can be either an anti - diquark state , @xmath26 , or a four - quark - antiquark state , @xmath27 , in the case of antiquark fragmentation , only four - antiquark states , @xmath28 , are possible assuming that there are no antiquarks in the @xmath3 .",
    "( production of @xmath3 s through coupling to higher fock states of the @xmath3 is more complicated and involves higher number of quarks in the intermediate states . as a result",
    "it would lead to contributions at lower @xmath17 values . )",
    "thus , we have    * ( 1a ) @xmath29 * ( 1b ) @xmath30 ,    for the quark fragmentation and    * \\(2 ) @xmath31 ,    for the antiquark fragmentation .",
    "while , in case ( 1a ) , the initial fragmenting quark is contained in the produced lambda , in case ( 1b ) and ( 2 ) , the lambda is mainly produced by quarks created in the fragmentation process .",
    "therefore , we not only expect that lambdas produced through ( 1a ) usually have larger momenta than those produced through ( 1b ) or ( 2 ) but also that lambdas produced through ( 1a ) are much more sensitive to the flavor spin quantum numbers of the fragmenting quark than those produced through ( 1b ) and ( 2 ) . in the following we",
    "assume that ( 1b ) and ( 2 ) lead to approximately the same fragmentation functions .",
    "in this case , the difference , @xmath32 , responsible for leading particle production , is given by the fragmentation functions associated with process ( 1a ) .",
    "similar observations also follow from energy - momentum conservation built in eqs .",
    "( [ frag2 ] ) and ( [ frag3 ] ) .",
    "the delta function implies that the function , @xmath33 , peaks at @xcite @xmath34 here , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the mass of the produced particle and the produced system , @xmath14 , and we work in the rest frame of the produced particle .",
    "we see that the location of the maxima of the fragmentation function depends on the mass of the system @xmath14 . while the high @xmath17 region is dominated by the fragmentation of a quark into the final particle and a small mass system",
    ", large mass systems contribute to the fragmentation at lower @xmath17 values .",
    "the maxima of the fragmentation functions from process ( 1a ) are given by the mass of the intermediate diquark state and that of the the fragmentation functions from the processes ( 1b ) and ( 2b ) by the masses of intermediate four quark states .",
    "thus , the contribution from process ( 1a ) is harder than those from ( 1b ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "energy - momentum conservation also requires that the fragmentation functions are not flavor symmetric .",
    "while the assertion of isospin symmetry , @xmath37 , is well justified , su(3 ) flavor symmetry is broken not only by the strange quark mass but also by the hyperfine interaction .",
    "let us discuss the fragmentation of a @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) quark and that of an @xmath40 quark into a lambda through process ( 1a ) .",
    "while the intermediate diquark state is always a scalar in the strange quark fragmentation , it can be either a vector or a scalar diquark in the fragmentation of the non - strange quarks .",
    "the masses of the scalar and vector non - strange diquarks follow from the mass difference between the nucleon and the delta @xcite , while those of the scalar and vector diquark containing a strange quark can be deduced from the mass difference between @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "they are roughly @xmath41 mev and @xmath42 mev for the scalar and vector non - strange diquarks , and @xmath43 mev and @xmath44 mev for scalar and vector diquarks containing strange quarks , respectively @xcite . according to eq .",
    "( [ max ] ) , these numbers lead to soft up and down quark fragmentation functions and to hard strange quark fragmentation functions .    energy - momentum conservation , together with the splitting of vector and scalar diquark masses , has the further important consequence that polarized non - strange quarks can transfer polarization to the final state lambda . to see this",
    "we note that the probabilities for the intermediate state to be a scalar or vector diquark state in the fragmentation of an up or down quark with parallel or anti - parallel spin to the spin of the lambda can be obtained from the @xmath45 wave function of the @xmath3 @xmath46\\,\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the @xmath38 or @xmath39 quarks with spin anti - parallel to the spin of the @xmath3 are always associated with a vector diquark , @xmath38 and @xmath39 quarks with parallel spin have equal probabilities to be accompanied by a vector or scalar diquark .",
    "the fragmentation functions of non - strange quarks with spin parallel to the @xmath3 spin are harder than the corresponding fragmentation functions with anti - parallel spins .",
    "thus , @xmath47 is positive for large @xmath17 values and negative for small @xmath17 .",
    "their total contribution to polarized lambda production might be zero or very small .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be sizable for large @xmath17 values , since both @xmath49 and @xmath47 are dominated by the spin - zero component in the large @xmath17 limit .",
    "furthermore , they will dominate polarized lambda production whenever the production from strange quarks is suppressed .",
    "the matrix elements can be calculated using model wave functions at the scale relevant to the specific model and the resulting fragmentation functions can be evolved to a higher scale to compare them to experiments . in a previous paper @xcite , we calculated the fragmentation functions in the mit bag model and showed that the resulting fragmentation functions give a very reasonable description of the data in @xmath9 annihilation .",
    "since the mass of the intermediate states containing more than two quarks are not known we only calculate the contributions of the diquark intermediate states in the bag model .",
    "the other contributions have been determined by performing a global fit to the @xmath9 data . for this",

    "spin - dependent fragmentation of quarks can be studied in proton - proton collisions with one of the protons polarized @xcite . here , many subprocesses may lead to the final state lambda so that one has to select certain kinematic regions to suppress the unwanted contributions .",

    "] one can study the role played by the fragmentation functions by comparing inclusive lambda and inclusive jet production .",
    "in particular , the contributions from channels containing two gluons in the final state are suppressed in inclusive lambda production due to the smallness of @xmath103 .",
    "we note that @xmath103 has been set to zero at the initial scale and is generated through evolution .",
    "thus , while @xmath86 is the dominant channel in inclusive lambda production , both @xmath86 and @xmath104 are equally important in inclusive jet production . there is some ambiguity due to our poor knowledge of the gluon fragmentation  larger probabilities for @xmath105 will enhance the contributions from gluons in inclusive lambda production .",
    "however , the contribution from the process @xmath104 falls off faster than that from @xmath86 with increasing rapidity , since @xmath106 decreases faster than @xmath107 with increasing @xmath71 and the lambdas are produced mainly from valence up and down quarks at high rapidities .",
    "our analysis of the kinematics and the various contributions to inclusive lambda production already indicate that lambda polarization measurements in pp collisions at high rapidities are ideally suited to test whether polarized up and down quarks may fragment into polarized @xmath3 s .",
    "we calculated the lambda polarization using our flavor asymmetric fragmentation functions for rhic energies and for @xmath91 gev .",
    "increasing the transverse momentum gives similar results , with the only difference that @xmath108 starts to increase at lower rapidities .",

    "we also checked that there is only a very weak dependence on the scale by calculating the polarization using @xmath109 and @xmath110 . the predicted lambda polarization is shown in fig  [ fig5]a .",

    ", strange quarks also contribute .",
    "however , since the ratios of the polarized to the unpolarized parton distributions are small at small @xmath71 the lambda polarization is suppressed .",
    "the result also depends on the parameterization of the polarized quark distributions .",
    "in particular , the polarized gluon distribution is not well constrained .",
    "however , it is clear from the kinematics that the ambiguity associated with the polarized gluon distributions only effects the results at lower rapidities",
    ". this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b where we plot the contribution from gluons , up plus down quarks and strange quarks to the lambda polarization .",
    "next , we contrast our prediction with the predictions of various @xmath4 flavor symmetric models which use @xmath111 we fitted the cross sections in @xmath9 annihilation using eq .",
    "( [ su3 ] ) and the functional form given in eq .",
    "( [ para ] ) . for the polarized fragmentation functions , we discuss two different scenarios : the model , @xmath112 ( c.f . fig .",
    "5a ) , corresponds to the expectations of the naive quark model that only polarized strange quarks can fragment into polarized lambdas @xmath113 it gives essentially zero polarization because the strange quarks contribute at low rapidities where the polarization is suppressed .",
    "model , @xmath114 ( c.f . fig .",
    "5a ) , which was proposed in ref.@xcite , is based on dis data , and sets @xmath115 this model predicts negative lambda polarization .",
    "finally , we address the problem of lambdas produced through the decay of other hyperons , such as @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in order to estimate",
    "the contribution of hyperon decays we assume , in the following , that    \\(1 ) the @xmath3 s produced through hyperon decay inherit the momentum of the parent hyperon    \\(2 ) and that the total probability to produce @xmath3 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 from a certain @xmath116 state is given by the @xmath45 wave function and is independent of the mass of the produced hyperon .",
    "further , in order to estimate the polarization transfer in the decay process we use the constituent quark model . the polarization can be obtained by noting that the boson emitted in both the @xmath117 and the @xmath118 decay changes the angular momentum of the nonstrange diquark from @xmath119 to @xmath120 , while the polarization of the spectator strange quark is unchanged .",
    "then , the polarization of the @xmath3 is determined by the polarization of the strange quark in the parent hyperon , since the polarization of the @xmath3 is exclusively carried by the strange quark in the naive quark model .",
    "first , let us discuss the case when the parent hyperon is produced by a strange quark . since the strange quark is always accompanied by a _ vector _",
    "@xmath121 diquark , in both @xmath5 and @xmath6 the fragmenation functions of strange quarks into these hyperons are much _ softer _ than the corresponding fragmentation function into a @xmath3 .",
    "thus , in the high @xmath17 limit , the contributions from the processes , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , are negligible compared to the direct production , @xmath124 .",
    "furthermore , both channels , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , enhance the already positive polarization from the direct channel , @xmath124 .",
    "this is different in the case when the parent hyperon is produced by an up or down quark .",
    "both @xmath3 and @xmath5 can be produced by an up ( down ) quark and a _ scalar _ @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) diquark  a process which dominates in the large @xmath17 limit .",
    "( the component with a vector diquark can be neglected in this limit ) .",
    "furthermore , the up and down fragmentation function of the @xmath6 are as important as those of the @xmath3 and @xmath5 in the large @xmath17 limit .",
    "this is because the @xmath38 fragmentation function of @xmath6 peaks at about @xmath127 which is almost the same as the peak of the _ scalar _ components of the @xmath3 and @xmath2 , which are @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively .",
    "thus , for the up and down quark fragmentation , it is important to include the @xmath3 s from these decay processes .",
    "the relevant probabilities to produce a @xmath3 with positive and negative polarization from a fragmenting up quark with positive polarization and an @xmath125 diquark are shown in table [ table:3 ] .",
    "we assumed that all spin states of the @xmath125 diquark are produced with equal probabilities .",
    "the final weights which are relevant in the large @xmath17 limit are set in bold .",
    "we find that if we include all channels , which survive in the large @xmath17 limit , the polarization of the @xmath3 is reduced by a factor of @xmath130 compared to the case where only the directly produced @xmath3 s are included .",
    "since the @xmath6 decay is a strong decay it is sometimes included in the fragmentation function of the @xmath3 . including only @xmath6",
    ", the suppression factor we obtain is @xmath131 .",
    "( note that our model predicts that @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 have approximately the same @xmath17 dependence and are approximately equal ( up to the clebsch - gordon factors ) since the ratios , @xmath135 , have roughly the same numerical values .",
    "thus , the effect of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays can be taken into account by a multiplicative factor . )    in order to illustrate the effect of these decays on the final @xmath3 polarization , we multiplied our results with these factors .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "6b as dotted lines .",
    "we note that our implementation of this correction relies on the assumptions that the produced @xmath3 carries all the momentum of the parent hyperon and that all states are produced with equal probabilities .",
    "since neither of these assumptions is strictly valid , we tend to overestimate the importance of hyperon decays .",
    "note also that the inclusion of @xmath5 decay in the @xmath4 symmetric models makes the resulting polarization more negative . as a result ,",
    "even if effects of @xmath2 decays are included , large discrepancies still persist between our predictions and those of @xmath4 symmetric models .",
    "measurements of the lambda polarization at rhic would provide a clear answer to the question of whether polarized up and down quarks can transfer polarization to the final state @xmath3 .",
    "we predict _ positive _ lambda polarization at high rapidities , in contrast with models based on @xmath4 flavor symmetry and dis which predict _ zero _ or _ negative _ lambda polarization .",
    "our prediction is based on the same physics which led to harder up than down quark distributions in the proton and to the @xmath0-n and @xmath2-@xmath3 mass splittings .",
    "we also estimated the importance of @xmath5 and @xmath6 decays which tend to reduce the predicted @xmath3 polarization .",
