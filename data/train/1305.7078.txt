    "the `` third integral of motion '' issue has been calling the attention of the astrophysics community for decades .",
    "we know nowadays the general form of an axially symmetric separable potential ( see @xcite and references therein ) and the vast majority of axially symmetric galactic models present stable equatorial circular orbits , as required by consistency .",
    "although the epicyclic approximation allows us to construct an approximate third integral near a stable circular orbit by adiabatic invariance of the corresponding vertical action @xcite , the range of validity of this integral is very limited .",
    "in particular , as we show below , the adiabatic approximation ( aa ) is valid for a region way much smaller than the thickness of the galactic thin disk . on the other hand , numerical experiments with orbits in axisymmetric disks",
    "have shown throughout the years that the region of quasi - integrability around the stable circular orbit is much wider than the region guaranteed by linear stability or by the kam theorem @xcite .",
    "moreover , most methods to obtain approximate third integrals involve extensive numerical modeling @xcite .",
    "thus , it is difficult to relate the corresponding results to the physical parameters of the system .",
    "we present in this letter a new approximate third integral of motion , valid for orbits which cross the galactic thin disk but do not belong to it .",
    "this integral describes the shape of nearly equatorial orbits in terms of the dynamical surface density of the thin disk .",
    "the approach is based on our recent results about a third integral of motion for nearly equatorial orbits in razor - thin disks @xcite and is valid for any sufficiently flattened axisymmetric disklike configuration .",
    "corrections due to the presence of additional structures are described and the results are compared with numerical simulations , showing good agreement in regions near the vertical edge of the thin disk . in an era of growing attention devoted to galactic @xcite and extragalactic @xcite surveys , simple expressions for third integrals of motion valid beyond the usual aa",
    "may be a crucial ingredient to a deeper understanding of the dynamics underlying the kinematical data obtained .",
    "for an axisymetric razor - thin disk , adiabatic invariance of the vertical approximate action @xmath4 next to a stable circular orbit leads to the fact that the vertical amplitude @xmath5 of the perturbed test - particle orbit is given by @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the surface density of the mass layer . in order to test the validity of eq .",
    "( [ invariant ] ) for nearly equatorial orbits , we must specify what we mean by the function @xmath8 in the case of non - negligible thickness .",
    "this function must have the following two properties : ( i ) it must reduce to the surface density of the thin disk in the limit of zero thickness ; ( ii ) it must represent a reasonable surface density profile for the 3d disk .",
    "we expect that , for highly flattened disks ( with a vertical dependence for @xmath9 approaching a dirac delta ) , the behavior of nearly equatorial orbits would be similar to the razor - thin case . in particular , eq .",
    "( [ invariant ] ) should still be valid in this case for an appropriate function @xmath10 .",
    "our goal in the next paragraphs is to describe the appropriate `` surface mass density function '' for disks with non - negligible thickness and to determine the range of validity of eq .",
    "( [ invariant ] ) .",
    "we consider the `` integrated dynamical surface density '' of the thin disk as @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the `` dynamical '' density profile of the thin disk : @xmath13 the subscript @xmath14 corresponds to each gravitating component , such as thin disk , thick disk , bulge and ( dark matter ) halo . here",
    ", @xmath15 is the thickness of the thin disk , which may vary with galactocentric radius . for sufficiently flattened disks we can consider @xmath15 as a constant , and in practice we may extend the corresponding integral of the thin - disk density @xmath16 to infinity .    the bulge and disk parts of ( [ sdens ] ) are the surface densities obtained from photometric studies of disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "they are related to the luminosity profile of the galaxy by assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio for the disk @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they reduce to the surface density of the corresponding razor - thin disk when the vertical dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath17 approaches a dirac delta . in this way , the above expression for @xmath10 satisfies our requirements .",
    "moreover , recent studies were able to obtain estimates for the total surface mass density ( [ sdens ] ) in the solar position , including dark matter ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the dynamical surface density of several spiral galaxies was also recently obtained via the ongoing diskmass survey @xcite . besides that",
    ", since the star s trajectory has no preference for the gravitational field of any specific component in ( [ rho ] ) , we will adopt the complete expression ( [ sdens ] ) further on .",
    "we therefore expect that expressions ( [ invariant][sdens ] ) work well for orbits whose amplitudes are comparable to the vertical thickness @xmath15 of the thin disk ( which may depend on r ) . if we consider orbits inside the thin disk , a more reasonable approximate third integral would be given by the usual adiabatic approximation ( aa ) @xcite .",
    "if the orbit has a vertical amplitude much smaller than @xmath15 , a non - negligible part of the disk s density distribution ( the portion with values of @xmath17 higher than the orbit s amplitude ) will generate a gravitational force which tends to repel the particle from the equatorial plane .",
    "however , eq . ( [ invariant ] ) , together the integrated surface density ( [ sdens ] ) , considers that every mass element of the disk generates a gravitational field which tends to bring the particle back to the equatorial plane . in this way ,",
    "( [ invariant ] ) and ( [ sdens ] ) give us values of @xmath5 which are smaller than the ones obtained from the aa .",
    "therefore , in regions very close to the equatorial plane , where the aa works well , eqs .",
    "( [ invariant ] ) and ( [ sdens ] ) underestimate the orbit s vertical amplitude .",
    "the error obtained is usually small , though .",
    "furthermore , orbits with large vertical amplitudes are mostly affected by the bulge or halo gravitational fields , depending on their mean galactocentric radius .",
    "in fact , this is exactly what we obtain for a miyamoto - nagai potential @xcite ( see eq .",
    "( [ helmimodel ] ) with @xmath18 ) and is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mnonecomp ] .",
    "these density distributions pervade all space .",
    "nevertheless , we can define a cutoff height by requiring that most of the disk mass is concentrated below this height .",
    "although this last statement is not precise , we see that for flattened disks ( with values of @xmath19 around @xmath20 ) a good choice for the cutoff height is @xmath21 , not depending on @xmath2 .",
    "the region between @xmath22 and @xmath15 contains more than 95% of the disk mass for any galactocentric radius ( the exact number varies with the ratio @xmath19 ) .",
    "it is interesting to remark that , for the miyamoto - nagai model , eq .",
    "( [ invariant ] ) gives practically the same results when @xmath7 is the surface density of the corresponding razor - thin disk ( @xmath23 ) and when it is the integrated surface density given by eq .",
    "( [ sdens ] ) .",
    "this occurs because the system is highly flattened ( @xmath24 ) , in such a way that most of the disk s density distribution is concentrated in a very slim region near the equatorial plane .    .",
    "the solid black line corresponds to the envelope predicted by ( [ invariant ] ) with surface density ( [ sdens ] ) .",
    "the prediction from the adiabatic approximation ( dashed line ) overestimates the orbit s amplitude .",
    "we choose units in which @xmath25 .",

    "if the thin - disk contribution dominates over the other components of the system , we can approximate @xmath34 .",
    "this approximation is very accurate if the density of the other components is very small or absent , as tested in a two - component miyamoto - nagai model representing a superposition of a thin and a thick disk ( according to @xcite , these disks have a radial scalelength @xmath35 .",
    "our simulations consider @xmath36 ) .",
    "however , as we increase the @xmath17- component @xmath37 of the orbit s specific angular momentum  therefore increasing the radius of the corresponding stable equatorial circular orbit and , as a consequence , the mean radius of the 3d orbit ",
    "corrections due to the presence of the thick disk must be taken into account .",
    "furthermore , for higher values of mean galactocentric radius ( where the thin - disk contribution is very small compared to the corresponding thick - disk surface density ) , we can approximate eq .",
    "( [ sdens ] ) by the term due to @xmath38 . according to the above numerical simulations ,",
    "( [ invariant ] ) still describes a very accurate third integral of motion for amplitudes near @xmath39 .",
    "we illustrate this behavior in fig .",
    "( [ fig : mntwocomp ] ) with a typical quasi - circular orbit of amplitude near the thin - disk cutoff , in the region where the thick - disk contribution begins to dominate .",
    "the comparison bewteen different expressions for the approximate third integral shows us that eqs .",
    "( [ invariant][rho ] ) result indeed in the most accurate description for the orbit s envelope .     in the two - component miyamoto - nagai model with vertical amplitude close to @xmath40 .",
    "the solid black line corresponds to the envelope predicted by ( [ invariant ] ) with surface density ( [ sdens ] ) , while the dashed line is the prediction from the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to eqs .",
    "( [ invariant][sdens ] ) with the contribution only of the thin disk , @xmath16 , and the dot - dashed line corresponds to the contribution only of @xmath41 .",
    "the thin - disk parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mnonecomp ] .",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 . ]    in all cases , deviations from ( [ invariant ] ) begin to appear once we consider orbits with higher energy .",
    "this fact is related to another important remark : the above numerical experiments show that our approximate integral does not work near resonances . in both situations , motion deviates significantly from the quasi - circular approximation and higher - order terms in the potential become important .",
    "although our tests were performed for miyamoto - nagai disks , the above considerations lead us to the hypothesis that this behavior is more general , working for any pair of axisymmetric thin+thick disk systems . in order to describe the approximate third integral of motion ( [ invariant ] ) in self - gravitating discoidal systems with more components ( such as a bulge and a halo ) we must",
    ", in principle , include the contributions from each different structure in ( [ rho ] ) .",
    "these contributions must affect significantly the shape of nearly equatorial orbits only in regions where their integrated surface density is comparable to the thin disk s surface density .",
    "recently , many models of the galaxy appeared in the literature .",
    "the need to tackle some fundamental issues , such as the degree of sphericity in the dark matter halo , led to simplifying hypotheses on the mass distributions of the different gravitating components of the milky way .",
    "more specifically , some recent works described , for simplicity , the disklike part of the galaxy as a miyamoto - nagai profile @xcite .",
    "the potentials adopted for the halo and for the bulge vary among authors .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that there is still some debate nowadays about the sphericity @xcite and triaxiality @xcite of the galaxy s dark matter halo .    in this manuscript",
    "we consider the `` bulge+disk+halo '' model described in @xcite .",
    "it consists of a miyamoto - nagai disk , a spherical hernquist bulge @xcite and a logarithmic potential for the halo . in view of the above discussion",
    ", we consider a spherical halo , case in which the gravitational potential due to the galaxy can be written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( disk mass ) , @xmath51 kpc and @xmath52 kpc are the disk parameters ; @xmath53 ( bulge mass ) , @xmath54 kpc are the bulge parameters ; @xmath55 km s@xmath56 , @xmath57 kpc are the halo parameters",
    ".    simulations in the corresponding `` disk+bulge '' system ( i.e. by setting @xmath58 ) show us that the bulge has a significant impact on the shape of disk - crossing orbits with amplitudes near @xmath15 only in regions where its contribution to ( [ sdens ] ) is comparable to the disk s contribution . in these regions",
    "both expression ( [ invariant ] ) and the aa give poor predictions for the shape of orbits , since the flattened component does not dominate anymore . as the orbits get far from the bulge",
    ", the results described in the former paragraphs become valid again .",
    "these results seem not to depend on the specific form of the bulge .",
    "we also performed tests with a plummer bulge @xcite in place of the hernquist profile and obtained the same qualitative scenario .",
    "numerical experiments show that the halo does not affect significantly the prediction of ( [ invariant][sdens ] ) and our predictions are a good approximation for orbits which do not get close to the bulge ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : helmi ] ) .",
    "we also considered orbits in a miyamoto - nagai disk superposed by two plummer spheres , which represent the bulge and the halo .",
    "the results obtained are also in accordance with the general picture described above .",
    "energy conservation was checked for all calculations performed with an accuracy characterized by a maximum relative error of @xmath59 .",
    ", @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath33 , and lies near the solar neighborhood ( @xmath63 @xcite ) , with vertical amplitude close to @xmath40 .",
    "the solid black line corresponds to the envelope predicted by ( [ invariant ] ) with surface density ( [ sdens ] ) , while the dashed line is the prediction from the adiabatic approximation . ]",
    "it would be instructive to check the validity of expressions ( [ invariant]-[sdens ] ) for orbits just outside the thin disk in mass models with two - component stellar disks which take into account the exponential dependence of @xmath7 on galactocentric radius @xcite , as well as vertical profiles which are more consistent with recent kinematic observations @xcite .",
    "for example , the luminosity density distribution within a galactic disk can be written in the general form @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the central luminosity density , @xmath66 is the scalelength , @xmath67 is the scaleheight and @xmath68 , i.e. ranging from the isothermal distribution ( @xmath69 ) to the exponential disk ( @xmath70 ) . by assuming that the mass - to - light ratio is constant , the above mathematical expression can be used to represent also the stellar mass distribution , which is dominant in regions within the optical disk and far from the bulge . in these regions ,",
    "the contribution of bulge and halo can be neglected and @xmath71 will be proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "observational results suggest that @xmath67 is independent of galactocentric radius @xcite but , for the sake of generality , we may consider it as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , equation ( [ invariant ] ) reduces to @xmath73 once we assume in eq .",
    "( [ sdens ] ) @xmath74 .",
    "( [ invariant - sec ] ) relates the vertical amplitude of disk - crossing orbits with the scaleheight ( depending of @xmath2 ) and the scalelength .",
    "if @xmath67 is assumed to be constant , the prediction for the vertical amplitude is given by @xmath75 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that equation ( [ invariant - sec ] ) is valid for any value of @xmath76 in the luminosity profile ( [ luminosity ] ) .",
    "in fact , eq . ( [ invariant - sec ] ) is valid for any `` separable '' luminosity profile with a well - defined scaleheight @xmath77",
    ". if the radial profile is not strictly exponential , the exponential in eq .",
    "( [ invariant - sec ] ) should be substituted by @xmath78 . in regions where the thick - disk contribution becomes relevant , the corresponding third integral ( [ invariant - sec ] )",
    "will depend on @xmath79  as well as on @xmath76  in a nontrivial manner .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to relate the vertical amplitude of disk - crossing orbits with the @xmath17-velocity dispersion by combining ( [ invariant ] ) with the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the @xmath17-velocity dispersion integrated over all @xmath17 and @xmath82 is some constant which varies between @xmath83 ( exponential disk , @xmath70 ) to @xmath84 ( isothermal distribution , @xmath69 ) . if we again assume that @xmath67 is a function of @xmath2 , then @xmath85 which relates the vertical amplitudes of disk - crossing orbits to two mensurable quantities , @xmath67 and @xmath86 .",
    "note that for the case of galactic disks represented by the luminosity profile ( [ luminosity ] ) we have that @xmath87 and the above expression reduces to ( [ invariant - sec ] ) . in this case",
    ", @xmath88 will have an exponential dependence on @xmath2 with an e - folding of twice the luminosity scalelength , a result pointed out by @xcite in the case of constant scaleheight .",
    "we now briefly describe the shape of orbits predicted by modified theories of gravity , as an extension of the formalism presented in @xcite . if motion of test particles is described by a modified potential @xmath89 ( as in @xcite ) with @xmath90 for a razor - thin disk , where @xmath91 is a function depending on the parameters of the modified theory and @xmath7 is the surface density of the thin disk , then the extension of the razor - thin disk formalism to three - dimensional disks will generate an approximate third integral of motion for nearly equatorial orbits which describes their envelope in the meridional plane by      with @xmath93 defined by @xmath94 here , @xmath95 is the disk s density distribution .",
    "if @xmath9 is concentrated near the galactic equatorial plane and if it falls off very rapidly with @xmath17 , we can approximate @xmath96 in the integrand of ( [ sigmapsi ] ) by its value at @xmath97 . with this approximation",
    ", the prediction for the envelopes in the meridional plane reduces to      with @xmath99 given by eq .",
    "( [ sdens ] ) .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ invariantmodified2 ] ) has the same form as its analogue in the case of razor - thin disks @xcite , the only difference being the use of the integrated surface mass density ( [ sdens ] ) in place of the 2d surface density .    for mond @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ invariantmodified2 ] ) is given by ( see @xcite ) @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the mond interpolating function , whereas for rggr @xcite we have @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the newtonian potential , given by poisson s equation , and @xmath104 is the circular velocity at infinity .",
    "we remark that the above predictions may be used in the future as an additional test of modified theories of gravity ( mg ) , once sufficient data concerning the vertical amplitudes of orbits near the equatorial plane of spiral galaxies becomes available .",
    "even if predictions for the rotation curves are the same as in newtonian gravity + dark matter ( dm ) models , the behavior of off - equatorial orbits may be a further probe to distinguish between dm and mg models for spiral galaxies .",
    "the above considerations may also be regarded as a dynamical counterpart to distinguish between thin - disk and thick - disk stars in models of the galaxy , complementary to kinematic and photometric studies ( @xcite , see also @xcite and references therein ) . moreover , the approximate third integral obtained here can be used as an effective `` vertical action '' in self - consistent models for the galaxy s distribution function depending on all action variables ( e.g. @xcite ) ."
