    "metzner and vollhardt @xcite pioneered a new approach to the study of strongly correlated electron systems which is exact in the limit of infinite dimensionality",
    ". generally referred to as dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , the method has been developed further in the subsequent years and has led to substantial progress in our understanding of these systems@xcite . soon after the work of metzner and vollhardt@xcite , in a series of papers@xcite , brandt and mielsch showed that the large dimensional limit of the spin - less falicov - kimball model ( sfkm)@xcite is exactly soluble and studied various aspects of the solution .",
    "one of the first issues examined in the sfkm using the dmft was that of ordering into a two sublattice , `` checkerboard '' , charge density wave ( cdw ) state that is expected to arise in the model at half - filling on a hyper cubic lattice . because the hyper cubic lattice is bipartite , a transition at a non - zero temperature is expected@xcite for all @xmath0 and indeed this is true within the dmft as well@xcite .    since the original work@xcite",
    ", a number of other studies of the ` uniform phase ' at high temperatures , the cdw order and of phase separation away from half filling have followed @xcite , on both the hyper cubic and bethe lattices .",
    "the homogeneous or uniform phase at high temperatures is a non - fermi liquid@xcite .",
    "a detailed study of transport in this phase has been carried out by moller _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "van dongen@xcite pointed out that for a lattice with a bounded density of states ( dos ) the half - filled system in the uniform phase displays a metal - insulator transition at a non - zero u. since the dmft is in the thermodynamic limit , one can determine the transition temperature for the continuous transition from the uniform to the cdw phase simply by finding the temperature at which the charge susceptibility at wave - vector @xmath1 diverges .",
    "thus one can obtain the phase diagram of the half filled system purely from the knowledge of the uniform solution . the phase diagram for commensurate and incommensurate filling ( away from half filling ) in one and two dimensions within the frame work of the dmft has been studied by freericks@xcite .    despite all this work ,",
    "the properties of the cdw phase itself do not seem to have been explored a great deal . in this contribution , we study the spectral and transport properties of the charge density wave ( cdw ) phase of the half - filled sfkm in the dmft approximation at a level of detail not reported before , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we present detailed results for the spectral functions in the cdw phase as functions of temperature and u. we show how the non - fermi liquid behavior in the uniform phase affects the cdw phase , and show that there is a region in the phase diagram , not emphasized in the literature before , where we get a cdw phase without a gap in the spectral function .",
    "this is a radical deviation from the static mean - field prediction where the gap is proportional to the order parameter , and the cdw phase is always gapped .",
    "the ` transition temperature ' @xmath2 between this novel gapless ` phase ' and the conventional gapped cdw phase has an interesting ` reentrant ' structure as u increases .",
    "the hamiltonian for the sfkm on a lattice with sites labeled by @xmath3 can be written as @xmath4 it includes spin - less conduction or band electrons @xmath5 with hopping parameters @xmath6 , which , in this paper , we assume to be non zero only for nearest neighbors , and localized @xmath7 electrons conserved at each site with site energy @xmath8 .",

    "there is an on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath0 between @xmath5 and @xmath7 . in this paper , we confine ourselves to the particle hole symmetric case , with @xmath10 _ and _ @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the total number of sites in the lattice . on bipartite lattices",
    "this is achieved by the choice @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",

    ", the resulting single site effective action at site @xmath3 is given by@xcite    @xmath15    here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are fluctuating fermionic grassmann fields corresponding to coherent states of the @xmath5 electrons , and @xmath18 1 or 0 corresponding to the @xmath7 state at site @xmath3 being occupied or not .",
    "@xmath19 is the bare on site local propagator ( also referred to as the host or medium propagator ) for the self consistent single site problem .",
    "it is essentially the local propagator at site @xmath3 excluding the self energy processes at that site ( since they will be recovered by solving the single site problem ) but including the self energy processes at all the other sites of the lattice in some average way .",

    "( [ localg ] ) , and cross - multiplying , one gets@xcite a quadratic equation which can be solved to express the self energy directly in terms of the local green s function and @xmath40 .",

    ", one has to next invoke the dmft self consistency relation which determines the local green s functions in terms of the local self energies via lattice propagators , based on treating the local self energy as a good approximation ( which is exact in infinite dimensions ) to the lattice self energy .",
    "for this purpose we need to use the lattice dyson equation , @xmath52 the properties of this relation depend very much on the phase one is interested in .",
    "at high temperatures the @xmath5 electrons and @xmath7 electrons are uniformly distributed on the lattice for all electron concentrations ; there is no long range order , and no broken symmetry . in this case of a homogeneous or uniform phase , w@xmath25=w@xmath53 , @xmath54 , etc . ; i.e. , the same for all the sites @xmath3 . and at half filling , by symmetry , w@xmath55 , so that @xmath56 w@xmath57 .",

    "the lattice green s function is @xmath61 hence the local green s function is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the bare density of states(dos ) of the band structure determined by @xmath6 .",

    "we also report some results using the actual density of states for a square lattice whence @xmath68 has to be evaluated numerically",
    ". we will refer to these as 2ddos results . in either case ,",
    "the local green s function and the self energy can be obtained by self consistently solving eqns .",
    "( [ sguni ] ) and ( [ lguni ] ) .    in the uniform case at half",
    "filling the temperature completely drops out of the problem , as the @xmath7 occupancy probabilities are fixed by symmetry .",
    "the metal - insulator transition we alluded to above @xcite hence takes place at a fixed value of @xmath0 independent of temperature within the dmft . for the sdos case",
    "this value is @xmath69 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the @xmath5 electron dos can be restored by including spatial fluctuations using approximations that go beyond dmft @xcite .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the homogeneous ( disordered ) phase becomes unstable with respect to an ordered phase where both the @xmath5 and @xmath7 charge densities with spatial modulations at some ordering wave - vector @xmath70 develop ; i.e. , @xmath71 and @xmath72 acquire nonzero values .",
    "if the transition to this ordered phase is continuous ( second - order ) , then it occurs when the charge - susceptibility ( at the ordering wave vector ) diverges .",

    "on the experimental front , gapless cdw phases have recently been observed in 2h- transition metal dichalcogenides ( eg . ,",
    "ref . and references therein ) .",
    "in these compounds , strongly coupled electronic and lattice degrees of freedom are involved in the generation of the cdw instability , and the gapless feature has been attributed to very large second neighbor hopping . since in our model we are considering only electronic degrees of freedom , and only nearest neighbor hopping , we have not compared the experiments directly with our findings .",
