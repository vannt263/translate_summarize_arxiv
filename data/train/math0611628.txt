    "the derivation of thermodynamics as a theory of large systems which are microscopically governed by fundamental laws of physics ( newton s laws or quantum physics ) has a large literature and tremendous progress for over a century within the field of statistical physics .",
    "see for instance @xcite for a physicist s account of statistical mechanics",
    ". nevertheless , from a control theorist s perspective , there are inadequacies in the existing treatment both with the level of mathematical rigor , and the applicability to far - from - equilibrium systems , particularly when subject to complex regulatory mechanisms .",
    "substantial work has already been done in formulating various results of classical thermodynamics in a more mathematical framework ( e.g. @xcite is a small sample ) , but statistical mechanics has received much less comparable attention .",
    "this paper focuses on simple problems in statistical mechanics in which the issue of rigor can be pursued , but aims also to set the stage for broader applicability .",
    "in particular , we construct a simple and clear control - theoretic modeling framework in which the only assumptions on the nature of the physical systems are conservation of energy and causality and all systems are of finite dimension and act on finite time horizons .",
    "we construct high - order lossless systems that approximate low - order dissipative systems in a systematic manner , and prove that a linear model is dissipative if and only if it is arbitrarily well approximated by lossless causal linear systems over an arbitrary long time horizon .",
    "we show how the error between the systems depend on the number of states in the approximation and the length of the time horizon .",
    "since human experience is based on a finite window of space and time , we argue that no human can directly distinguish between a low - order macroscopic dissipative system and its high - order lossless approximation .",
    "the lossless systems studied here are consistent with classical physics , since they conserve energy , are causal , and are time reversible .",
    "uncertainty in their initial state gives a simple explanation of the _ johnson - nyquist noise _ that can be observed at a macroscopic level .",
    "we also derive some well - known results from statistical mechanics , including the _ fluctuation - dissipation theorem_. as a further application , we study the implications of these results for an idealized measurement device , and exhibit a back - action effect , that there is no precise measurement without perturbation on the measured system , that arises naturally in a purely classical setting .",
    "we hope this paper is a step towards building a framework for understanding fundamental limitations in control and estimation that arise due to the physical implementation of measurement and actuation devices .",
    "we defer many important and difficult issues here such as how to actually model measurement devices realistically .",
    "it is also clear that this framework would benefit from a behavioral setting @xcite .",
    "however , for the points we make with this paper , a conventional input - output setting with only regular interconnections is sufficient .",
    "aficionados will easily see the generalizations , the details of which might be an obstacle to readability for others .",
    "perhaps the most glaring unresolved issue is how to best motivate the introduction of stochastics . in conventional statistical mechanics , a stochastic framework is taken for granted , whereas we aim to explain if and when stochastics arise naturally , and in this we are only partially successful .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : micro ] , we define the class of linear lossless / causal systems . in section  [ sec : physapprox_statical ] , we derive lossless / causal approximations of memoryless dissipative systems and obtain johnson - nyquist noise . in sections  [ sec : interconnect ] and [ sec : backaction ] , we discuss interconnections of systems and introduce an idealized measurement device with back action . finally , in section  [ sec :",
    "memory ] we generalize the procedure from section  [ sec : physapprox_statical ] to a class of linear dissipative systems with memory , and in section  [ sec : fluct ] obtain the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "in this paper , we consider linear systems in the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 is controllable .",
    "it is assumed that the input @xmath3 and the output @xmath4 are scalars .",
    "we define the internal energy of ( [ eq : physlinear ] ) as @xmath5 we argue these systems have desirable `` physical '' properties .",
    "these properties are losslessness and causality .",
    "_ lossless _",
    "@xcite means that the internal energy satisfies @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the _ work rate _ on the system .",
    "if there is no work done on the system , @xmath8 , then the internal energy @xmath9 is constant and conserved . if there is work done on the system , @xmath10 , the internal energy increases .",
    "the work , however , can be extracted again , @xmath11 , since the energy is conserved and the system is controllable .",
    "conservation of energy is a common assumption on microscopical models in statistical mechanics @xcite .    _",
    "causal _ here means that there is no direct term between the input @xmath12 and the output @xmath13 .",
    "this means that there is no instantaneous reaction of the system .",
    "also this is a reasonable physical assumption .",
    "[ def : physical ] systems ( [ eq : physlinear ] ) that satisfy the above assumptions are simply called _",
    "lossless / causal systems_.    later we will seek approximations of dissipative systems in the class of lossless / causal systems .",
    "the lossless / causal systems are rather abstract but have properties that we argue are reasonable from a physical point of view , as illustrated by the following example .",
    "consider the inductor - capacitor circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig : lccircuit ] .",
    "let the input @xmath12 be the current through the current source , and the output @xmath13 the voltage across the current source .",
    "then a model is given by @xmath14 and it satisfies definition  [ def : physical ] .",
    "in this section , we see how dissipative models , models where energy disappears , can be approximated by the lossless / causal models .",
    "we start with simple memoryless models , which give rise to heat baths and johnson - nyquist noise .",
    "many times macroscopic systems , such as resistors , can be modeled approximately by simple input - output relations @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a scalar . if @xmath17 , the system is dissipative since we can never extract any work .",
    "this is because the work rate is always positive @xmath18 for all @xmath19 and @xmath12 .",
    "hence , ( [ eq : diss ] ) is neither lossless nor causal .",
    "next , we show how we can approximate ( [ eq : diss ] ) arbitrarily well with a lossless / causal system over _ finite _ , but arbitrarily long , time horizons .",
    "first , choose a time interval of interest , @xmath20 $ ] , and rewrite ( [ eq : diss ] ) using a convolution integral @xmath21 when @xmath12 is at least continuous and has compact support on @xmath20 $ ] , and @xmath22 is the dirac distribution . let us call @xmath23 the _ recurrence time _ of the model .",
    "the recurrence time interval contains all the time instants where we perform experiments on the model , and can be very long . over this time interval ,",
    "the system is equally well modeled by the impulse response @xmath24 which is a @xmath25-periodic distribution .",
    "@xmath26 can be expanded in a fourier series with convergence in the sense of distributions : @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "define the truncated fourier series by @xmath29 we can split @xmath30 into its causal and anti - causal parts : @xmath31 we can realize the causal part @xmath32 as the impulse response of a lossless / causal system of order @xmath33 with the matrices @xmath34 we can realize @xmath35 with a similar system by reversing time .",
    "that the series ( [ eq : kdistr ] ) converges in the sense of distributions means that for all smooth @xmath12 of compact support on @xmath20 $ ] we have that @xmath36 a closer study of the two integrals reveals that @xmath37 because of the anti - causal / causal decomposition .",
    "hence , since @xmath12 is continuous , we can model @xmath38 with only the causal part if we normalize the causal part with a factor two .",
    "we identify the lossless / causal approximation of ( [ eq : diss ] ) with a linear operator @xmath39 : @xmath40 it is realized by the triple @xmath41 .",

    "the proposition shows that by choosing @xmath50 sufficiently large , we can approximate the memoryless model ( [ eq : diss ] ) as well as we like with a lossless / causal system , if inputs are smooth . it is a reasonable assumption that inputs , such as voltages , are smooth since we usually can not change them arbitrarily fast due to physical limitations .",
    "physically , we can think of @xmath33 as the number of degrees of freedom in a resistor .",
    "this is usually a number with the size of avogadro s number , @xmath51",
    ". then the recurrence time @xmath23 can be very large without a significant error .",
    "this explains how the dissipative model ( [ eq : diss ] ) is consistent with a physics based on energy conserving systems .",
