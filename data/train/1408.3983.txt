    "<S> specifically , the physical understanding of a `` warm '' system ( mot temperature ) obtained in his work will prove valuable when future atomic clocks and/or stable lasers will be operated under more noisy and compact environments , e.g. in vehicles and space crafts , where the size , ruggedness and convenience of the setup might dictate higher atomic temperatures than what is currently used for state - of - the - art systems . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation , this work will serve as an important piece of technical understanding for out - of - lab clocks employing warm atoms .    </S>",
