    "about 2ga , a green phytoplankton signal developed in the oceans and about 0.44ga , an extensive land plant cover developed , generating the red chlorophyll edge in the reflection spectrum .",
    "the oxygen and ozone absorption features could have been used to derive the presence of biological activity on earth anytime during the past 50% of the age of the solar system , while the chlorophyll red - edge reflection feature evolved during the most recent 10% of the age of the solar system .",
