    "neutron stars are laboratories for dense matter physics , because they are composed of the densest form of hadrons and leptons .",
    "however , the detail of neutron star properties , for example , the mass , radius and the particle fractions in the core of neutron star , is not yet theoretically understood .",
    "thus , the observation of the mass and/or radius can provide strong constraints on the equation of state ( eos ) of highly dense matter .",
    "the typical mass of a neutron star is known to be around @xmath5 ( solar mass ) .",
    "however , a few massive neutron stars have recently been observed precisely .",
    "shapiro delay measurements from radio timing observations of the binary millisecond pulsar ( psr j1614 - 2230 ) have indicated the mass of @xmath1  @xcite .    however , it is difficult to explain the mass of psr j1614 - 2230 by the eos which has been calculated so far , because the inclusion of hyperons makes the eos very soft and the maximum mass of a neutron star is thus reduced .",
    "therefore , it is very urgent to reconcile this discrepancy .",
    "@xcite , we have extended the quark - meson coupling ( qmc ) model  @xcite to include the quark - quark hyperfine interaction due to the exchanges of gluon and pion based on chiral symmetry .",
    "we call this improved version the chiral qmc ( cqmc ) model .",
    "then , we have applied it to a neutron star within relativistic hartree - fock ( rhf ) approximation , and shown that the mass of psr j1614 - 2230 can be explained  @xcite . in the present calculation , instead of rhf",
    ", we study the neutron - star properties in relativistic hartree approximation .",

    "the effective baryon mass , @xmath20 , is calculated by using the simple qmc or cqmc model , and it can be parameterized as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath18 : @xmath21 with @xmath22 ,      \\hspace{0.4 cm }      g_{\\sigma^{\\ast}b}(\\sigma^{\\ast } )       = g_{\\sigma^{\\ast}b}b_{b}^{\\prime }      \\left[1-\\frac{a_{b}^{\\prime}}{2}\\left(g_{\\sigma^{\\ast}\\lambda}\\sigma^{\\ast}\\right)\\right ] ,      \\label{eq : scalar - coupling - constants}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are respectively the @xmath15-@xmath25 and @xmath18-@xmath2 coupling constants at zero density . here",
    ", we introduce four parameters , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , to describe the mass , and these values are listed in table  [ tab:1 ] .",

    "to study the role of hyperons ( y ) on the properties of neutron star , it is very important to extend su(6 ) symmetry based on the quark model to the more general su(3 ) flavor symmetry . in general , the interaction lagrangian density in su(3 ) is given by  @xcite @xmath34 b )       + ( 1-\\alpha ) { \\rm tr}(\\{{\\bar b } , m_8\\ } b ) \\right ]       - g_1 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3 } } { \\rm tr}({\\bar b}b){\\rm tr}(m_1 ) ,       \\label{eq : su(3)-lagrangian}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are respectively the coupling constants for the meson singlet and octet states , and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) denotes the @xmath39 ratio .",

    "the latest extended soft - core ( esc ) model by the nijmegen group suggests that the ratio @xmath40 is 0.1949 for vector mesons , while @xmath41 in su(6 ) symmetry . in the esc model , the mixing angle is chosen to be @xmath42 , which is close to the ideal mixing ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "therefore , in the present study , we use the @xmath44 value in the esc model and assume the ideal mixing to determine the vector - meson couplings to hyperons . for the @xmath15-y coupling constants , as in @xcite , we fix them so as to fit the hyperon potential suggested by the experiments .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : tov ] , we present the mass - radius relation for a neutron star , which is calculated using the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation with the eos in the qmc or cqmc model .",
    "the inclusion of the strange mesons ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) makes the eos stiff , and the maximum mass of neutron star is thus pushed upwards in both models .",
    "in fact , this enhancement is mainly caused by @xmath19 meson , and the effect of @xmath18 meson is not large .",
    "furthermore , extending su(6 ) to su(3 ) symmetry in the vector - meson couplings ( this case is denoted by  beyond su(6 ) \" in the figure ) , the maximum mass can reach the massive pulsar mass , @xmath1  @xcite .",
