    "topcolor assisted technicolor  @xcite is a model of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking in which the top quark is heavy because of a new dynamics .",
    "topcolor replaces the @xmath4 of qcd with @xmath5 for the third quark generation and @xmath6 for the first two generations .",
    "the additional su(3 ) symmetry produces a @xmath7 condensate which makes the top quark heavy , and gives rise to a color octet gauge boson , the topgluon b. the topgluon is expected to be wide ( @xmath8 ) and massive ( @xmath9 tev ) . in hadron collisions it is produced through a small coupling to the first two generations , and then decays via a much larger coupling to the third generation : @xmath10 .",
    "here we estimate the mass reach for topgluons decaying to @xmath0 at the tevatron .",
    "the sub - process cross section for @xmath11 from both qcd and topgluons is given by  @xcite @xmath12 for a topgluon of mass @xmath13 and width @xmath14 given by @xmath15 \\label{eq_width}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the strong coupling , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are subprocess mandelstam variables , @xmath19 is the mixing angle between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath20 is the scattering angle between the bottom quark and the initial state quark in the center of mass frame , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the top quark mass .",
    "topcolor requires @xmath23 to make the top quark heavy . in eq .",
    "[ eq_width ] , the first term in square brackets is for four light quarks , and the second term has two components , the first for the bottom quark and the second for massive top quarks . in eq .  [ eq_xsec ] , the 1 inside the absolute value brackets is for the normal qcd process @xmath24 .",
    "the other term inside the brackets is the breit - wigner topgluon resonance term for the process @xmath25 .",
    "the two processes interfere constructively to the left of the mass peak and destructively to the right of the mass peak .",
    "cdf has done a preliminary search  @xcite in which the interference between normal gluons and topgluons was modeled in the opposite way : destructive to the left of the mass peak and constructive to the right .",
    "that model of the interference , hybrid model c in reference  @xcite , is inappropriate for topcolor assisted technicolor and is replaced by eq .",
    "[ eq_xsec ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig_parton ] we have convoluted eq .  [ eq_xsec ] with cteq2l parton distributions  @xcite to calculate the qcd background and topgluon signal for the case of an 800 gev topgluon in @xmath26 collisions at @xmath27 tev . fig .",
    "[ fig_parton ] also includes the qcd process @xmath28 which is only significant at low mass . in fig .",
    "[ fig_parton]1a we plot the differential cross section @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the invariant mass of the @xmath0 system .",
    "we require both @xmath31 quarks to have pseudorapidity @xmath32 and the @xmath0 system to have center of mass scattering angle @xmath33 .",
    "a clear distortion of the qcd @xmath0 spectrum is caused by the presence of a topgluon in fig .",
    "[ fig_parton]a .",
    "after subtraction of the qcd background , fig  [ fig_parton]b shows that the signal has a very long high tail to low masses , caused by the combination of constructive interference and parton distributions that rise rapidly as the @xmath0 mass decreases .",
    "the tail is significantly larger than the peak , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_parton]b .",
    "nevertheless , the ratio between the topgluon signal and the qcd background , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_parton]c , displays a noticeable peak close to the topgluon mass .    in fig .",

    "[ fig_parton ] using the pythia monte carlo  @xcite , including qcd radiation , and a simulation of the cdf detector .",
    "the mass peaks due to a topgluon are still visible when compared to qcd on a linear scale in fig .",
    "[ fig_pythia_qfl]c .",
    "similar calculations have been performed for the masses 400 , 600 , and 1000 gev .",
    "the qcd background we have considered so far is only the lowest order processes @xmath11 and @xmath34 . for an analysis in which we only tag one of the two b quarks",
    ", the background should also includes contributions from final state gluon splitting to @xmath0 , flavor excitation where an initial state gluon splits into @xmath0 and one of the two b quarks undergoes a hard scatter , and contributions from jets faking a b - tag and from charm . to get the most realistic estimate of the background we use cdf run 1a data in which we require at least one of the two leading jets to be tagged as a bottom quark .",
    "the b - tag requires a displaced vertex in the secondary vertex detector  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 reconstruction efficiency when we required at least a single b - tag    was @xmath35 in run 1a  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig_pythia_qfl]d we show cdf run 1a data on both the untagged dijet mass spectrum and the b - tagged dijet mass spectrum compared to a parameterized fit  @xcite . notice that the single b - tagged dijet mass spectrum is about an order of magnitude higher than the simulated background from direct @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig_pythia_qfl]a .",
    "we estimate that the single b - tagged data is roughly 20% fakes , 30% charm , 50% bottom , and only 1/5 of the bottom component is direct @xmath0 and the rest is gluon splitting and flavor excitation  @xcite .",
    "we fit the b - tagged dijet mass spectrum to the functional form , @xmath36 , with parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the fit is used to estimate the background to topgluons when calculating the discovery reach .",
    "to calculate the discovery mass reach we integrate both the fully simulated topgluon signal cross section and the b - tagged dijet background parameterization within the range @xmath40 . the resulting total topgluon signal in the @xmath0 channel",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_reach ] . the resulting background rate in this mass range is used to find the 5 @xmath41 discovery cross section .",
    "this is conservatively defined as the cross section which is above the background by 5 @xmath41 , where @xmath41 is the statistical error on the measured cross section ( not the background ) .",
    "for example , if the background were zero events the @xmath42 discovery rate would be 25 events . to obtain the discovery cross section we used both the luminosity and the 25% @xmath0 reconstruction efficiency . in fig .",
    "[ fig_reach ] we compare the topgluon signal cross section to the 5 @xmath41 discovery cross section for two different luminosities : 2 fb@xmath2 for tevatron collider run ii and 30 fb@xmath2 for tev33 .",
    "the topgluon discovery mass reach , defined as the mass at which a topgluon would be discovered with a 5@xmath41 signal , is tabulated in table i as a function of integrated luminosity and topgluon width",
    ". the mass reach decreases with increasing width , caused by worsening signal to background within the search window .",
    "the width as a function of mixing angle , from eq .",
    "[ eq_width ] , is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_parton]d and [ fig_reach]d . also shown is the preferred theoretical range for the mixing angle @xmath43 , determined from the topcolor model and constraints from other data  @xcite , which then implies an allowed width of the topgluon somewhere in the range @xmath8 .",
    "in this analysis , we have not included any systematic uncertainties on the measured signal , and we have assumed that the shape and magnitude of the single b - tagged background spectrum will be well understood . also , we have approximated the background by an extrapolation of existing b - tagged data into a higher mass region .",
    "adding systematics on the signal and the background will decrease the mass reach of a real search .",
    "however , we anticipate a factor of two improvement in b - tagging efficiency when the run 1b algorithm is used , and further improvements are possible in run ii and tev33 . also , this analysis only considers single b - tagging ; an analysis which tags both @xmath31 quarks from the topgluon decay will likely have a significantly better discovery reach because the backgrounds from gluon splitting , flavor excitation , and fakes will be significantly reduced .",
    "in order to have a background estimate from the data , we did the analysis for a center of mass energy of @xmath27 tev , while run ii and tev33 will be at @xmath44 tev which could provide a 10% larger mass reach .",
    "we have also not done a maximum likelihood fit , which would be a more sensitive statistical test for the presence of a signal . adding these improvements should increase the mass reach of a real search .",
    "the positive consequences of future improvements will likely exceed the negative consequences of neglecting systematics .",
    "we believe our analysis gives a conservative estimate of the mass reach .",
