    "one of the long - standing problems in modern astronomy is the curious division of globular clusters ( gcs ) into two groups , according to the mean period ( @xmath0 ) of type ab rr lyrae variables @xcite . understanding this phenomenon , `` the oosterhoff dichotomy '' ,",
    "is intimately related to the population ii distance scale and the formation of the milky way halo ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite first suggested  hysteresis mechanism \" , which explains the dichotomy as a difference in mean temperature between the type ab rr lyraes in two groups . that this can not be the whole explanation for the dichotomy became clear when @xcite found a period - shift at given temperature between the rr lyraes in two gcs representing each of the oosterhoff groups , m15 and m3 .",
    "sandage suggested that this shift is due to the luminosity difference , which , however , required that the rr lyraes in m15 are abnormally enhanced in helium abundance .",
    "* hereafter ldz i ) , on the other hand , found that rr lyraes evolved away from the zero - age horizontal - branch ( zahb ) can explain the observed period - shift when the hb type ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ldz ii ) is sufficiently blue . in the case of m15 , which has a blue tail ( or extreme blue hb ;",
    "ebhb ) in addition to normal blue hb @xcite , it was not clear though whether this evolution effect alone can reproduce the period - shift .",
    "more recent colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for other metal - poor oosterhoff group ii gcs , ngc  4590 , 5053 , and 5466 @xcite , also show that the hb types for these gcs are too red ( hb  type @xmath1 0.5 ) to have enough evolution effect .",
    "this suggests that a significant fraction of rr lyraes in these gcs , including m15 , are probably near the zahb .",
    "therefore , the complete understanding of the difference between the two oosterhoff groups still requires further investigation .",
    "recent discovery of multiple populations in gcs is throwing new light on this problem . even in `` normal ''",
    "gcs without signs of supernovae enrichments , observations and population models suggest the presence of two or more subpopulations differing in helium and light elements abundances , including cno ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "it was suggested to be due to the chemical pollution and enrichment by intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , fast - rotating massive stars , and/or rotating agb stars @xcite . since the colour of the hb is sensitively affected by age , helium and cno abundances ( see ldz ii ) , each subpopulation in a gc",
    "would be placed in a different colour regime on the hb .",
    "similarly , this would affect the period of rr lyraes as the variation in chemical composition would change the luminosity and mass of a hb star within the instability strip , by which the period is determined when temperature is fixed @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to suggest that , in the multiple populations paradigm , the difference in period between the two oosterhoff groups can be reproduced as the instability strip is progressively occupied by different subpopulations with increasing metallicity .",
    "photometry of m15 shows , ignoring a few red hb stars , three distinct subgroups on the hb : rr lyraes , blue hb , and the blue tail ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hb ] , upper panel ) .",
    "interestingly , other metal - poor group ii gcs without the blue tail , such as ngc  5466 and ngc  4590 , also show distinct gaps between the blue hb and rr lyraes @xcite .",
    "we assume that these subgroups and gaps are originated from distinct subpopulations in these gcs . according to this picture , m15 , for example , would contain three subpopulations , while ngc 5466 and 4590 are consisted with two subpopulations .",
    "most of the colour spread on the hb is then due to the presence of multiple populations , rather than the mass dispersion @xcite .",
    "therefore , in our population modeling , the mass dispersion on the hb was assumed to be very small ( @xmath2 = 0.009 @xmath3 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : hb ] ( upper panel ) and figure  [ fig : acs ] compare our models for m15 with the observations .",
    "our models are based on the updated @xmath4 isochrones and hb evolutionary tracks , including the cases of enhanced helium and cno abundances . for the details of our model construction ,",

[ fig : hb ] , upper panel ) . by adopting [ fe / h ] = -2.2 @xcite and the @xcite mass - loss parameter @xmath15 = 0.42 is somewhat smaller than the value ( 0.53 ) suggested by @xcite .",
    "this is because helium - enhanced subpopulations are included in their gc sample used in the @xmath15 calibration , while here we are adopting the value that would be obtained when they are excluded . ] , we find g1 would be placed on the blue hb at the age of 12.5 gyr . when the blue tail is excluded , the hb type of m15 becomes 0.46 @xcite , which is too red to have enough period - shift from the evolution effect alone .",
    "this suggests that most , if not all , rr lyraes in m15 are produced by the second generation stars ( g2 ) with chemical compositions favorable to produce rr lyraes with longer periods .",
    "both theories and observations suggest g2 would be somewhat enhanced in both helium and cno abundances , preferably in metal - poor gcs @xcite .",
    "while the enhanced helium abundance shifts the hb to blue , both cno enhancement and younger age for g2 favor redder hb ( ldz ii ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , when @xmath10@xmath12 is relatively small , the effects from cno and younger age would overwhelm the helium effect , and the net effect will move the hb to red .",
    "we find that @xmath10@xmath12 = 0.015 , @xmath10@xmath11 = 0.00026 ( @xmath10[cno / fe ] = 0.47 dex ) , and @xmath10@xmath16 = 1.1 gyr between g1 and g2 would best match the observations , both distribution of rr lyraes on the cmd ( see fig .  [ fig : hb ] , upper panel ) and the period - shift ( see below ) .",
    "some evidence for the possible difference in cno abundance between g1 and g2 in m15 is provided by @xcite , who found a large spread in [ n / fe ] ( @xmath17  2  dex ) among stars having identical [ c / fe ] in m15 .",
    "this suggests that cno sum could be different if variation in [ o / fe ] is not significant among them .",
    "it is also interesting to note that out of 6 rgb stars observed in m15 , @xcite found one ( @xmath17  17  @xmath18 ) shows significant enhancement ( @xmath17  0.4  dex ) in cno abundance , roughly consistent with our ratio of g2 ( @xmath17  20  @xmath18 ) .",
    "certainly , spectroscopy with a large sample of stars , preferably at the lower rgb , is required to confirm this scenario . finally , many previous works suggest that the blue tail ( ebhb ) would be produced by super - helium - rich subpopulation @xcite , and therefore we assign more helium - rich third and later generations of stars ( hereafter collectively g3 ) for the progenitor of ebhb . it is evident that some helium spread within g3 is required to reproduce the observed extension of the blue tail , which is mimicked here by increasing mass dispersion ( @xmath2 = 0.023 @xmath3 )",
    ". table  [ tbl : pm ] lists our best fit input parameters for m15 , where the population ratio is from distinct subgroups observed on the hb of @xcite    -  @xmath5)@xmath19 = 15.35 mag and @xmath7(f606w  -  f814w ) = 0.065 mag.[fig : acs],scaledwidth=47.0% ]    it is interesting to see that when our hb model for m15 is shifted redward by increasing metallicity , the hb morphology similar to m3 ( hb type = 0.08 ) is naturally obtained .",
    "this is illustrated by a more metal - rich model in figure  [ fig : hb ] ( middle panel ) .",
    "for this model , identical values of ages , @xmath10@xmath11 , and mass - loss parameter @xmath15 adopted for m15 have been used , while the metal abundance varies from [ fe / h ] = -2.2 to [ fe / h ] = -1.7 .",
    "the helium abundances for g1 and g2 have also been fixed , while that for g3 has been reduced to y = 0.28 , because otherwise our model would produce blue hb that is too blue compared to the observation of m3 .",
    "note that , because of the dispersion in helium abundance among g3 , at the red end of the blue hb for m3 , which is the critical regime for the @xcite test , the enhancement in y would be only @xmath17  0.015 compared to the red hb . because the overall hb morphology is shifted to red , the instability strip is now mostly occupied by g1 , while the red hb is populated by both g1 and g2 .",
    "consequently , the gap , which was placed between the ebhb ( g3 ) and blue hb ( g1 ) in our m15 model , is likewise shifted into the instability strip , which agrees well with the observation for m3 ( see fig",
    ". 14 of * ? ? ?",
    "some evolved stars from g1 , g2 and g3 are also placed within the instability strip , which would explain the presence of minority population of brighter rr lyraes with longer periods observed in this gc @xcite .",
    "further fine tuning of input parameters , such as age , @xmath11 , helium abundance , and population ratio for each subpopulation would be required to obtain a better match with the observation .    when the metallicity is increased further to [ fe / h ] = - 0.7 ,",
    "our models yield the hb morphology that is analogous to ngc 6441 ( hb type = - 0.77 ) , the oosterhoff iii gc with longest @xmath0 ( lower panel ) .",
    "again , @xmath10@xmath16 and @xmath10@xmath11 among subpopulations , @xmath10@xmath12 between g1 and g2 , and the mass - loss parameter @xmath15 are held identical to those adopted for m15 . for this model ,",
    "however , absolute ages have been increased by @xmath17  1 gyr compared to m3-like model , and the mean value of the helium abundance for g3 has been adopted to be y = 0.30 .",
    "note that the red hb is populated by all three subpopulations , while g3 is penetrating into the instability strip , producing rr lyrae variables and some blue hb stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : zahb ] explains , using zahb models , the origin of the sandage period - shift effect between m15 ( group ii ) and m3 ( group i ) in the new paradigm . in our model for m15 , g2 , which is enhanced in helium and cno abundances , are in the instability strip .",
    "while enhancement in helium increases luminosity , enhancement in cno reduces mass of hb stars at given temperature .",
    "both of these effects play a role in increasing the period of rr lyrae variables @xcite in our model for m15 . consequently , in our synthetic hb models , where the full evolutionary tracks are employed in addition to zahb models , the period - shift between m15 and m3 is predicted to be @xmath10log  @xmath20 = 0.040 , where @xmath20 is in days .",
    "adopting the temperature shift of the fundamental blue edge ( @xmath10log  @xmath21 = 0.02 ) as a function of metallicity @xcite , the same models yield the difference in mean period of type ab rr lyraes of @xmath10@xmath0 = 0.087 day .",
    "these values agree well with the observed period - shift ( @xmath10log  @xmath20 = 0.044  @xmath14  0.01 ; ldz i ) and the difference in @xmath0 ( @xmath10@xmath22 = 0.082  @xmath14  0.02 day ; @xcite ) between these gcs . despite the uncertainty in the fundamental blue edge ,",
    "the fraction of c type rr lyraes ( @xmath23 ) is predicted to be 0.48 and 0.13 for m15 and m3 , respectively , which should be compared with the observed values , 0.53 and 0.18 @xcite .",
    "for our ngc 6441-like model , we obtain @xmath10@xmath22 = 0.18 day and @xmath23 = 0.22 , which is in reasonable agreement with the observation .",
    "= 3.83 , vertical dashed line ) . while enhancement in helium increases luminosity ( middle panel ) , enhancement in cno reduces mass of hb stars at given temperature ( lower panel ) .",
    "both of these effects play a role in increasing the period - shift of rr lyraes in m15 ( see the text).[fig : zahb],scaledwidth=43.0% ]    , scaledwidth=51.0% ]",
    "figure  [ fig : oo ] shows a schematic diagram that explains the main points from our models . as discussed above , rr lyraes in the metal - poor group ii cluster m15 are produced by helium and cno enhanced g2 ( lower panel ) . when the hb of this metal - poor model is shifted redward with increasing metallicity , the instability strip becomes mostly populated by g1 having oosterhoff i characteristics ( middle panel ) .",
    "when this redward shift continues as metallicity increases further , our models indicate that the instability strip would be more populated by g3 , producing first the transition case between the groups i and iii , having mildly helium enhanced ( y @xmath1  0.26 ) rr lyraes with oosterhoff - intermediate characteristics , such as ngc 1851 , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "then , in the most metal - rich regime , if g3 are present , gcs with rr lyraes having more enhanced helium abundance ( y @xmath1  0.30 ) and longest periods like ngc 6441 ( group iii ) would be produced ( upper panel ) .",
    "note that the placements of g1 and g2 in this schematic diagram is valid only for gcs where @xmath10@xmath16 between g1 and g2 is similar to that in the case of m15 .",
    "if @xmath10@xmath16 is much smaller than @xmath17  1 gyr as adopted in our models , for example , the rr lyraes in group i gcs would be more dominated by g2 , while the red hb becomes more populated by g1 .",
    "it appears unlikely , however , that these variations are common , because otherwise most group i gcs would have oosterhoff - intermediate characteristics in period - shift and @xmath0 .",
    "some gcs like ngc 6397 show very small spread in the colour on the hb , as well as in the na - o plane @xcite , which suggest that these gcs are probably consisted with only g1",
    ". therefore , there are cases / systems where the suggested population shift can not be a viable explanation for the oosterhoff dichotomy . for these gcs , evolution",
    "away from zahb ( ldz i ) and some hysteresis mechanism @xcite are probably at works for the difference in @xmath0 between the groups i and ii .",
    "the na - o anticorrelations observed in some hb stars in gcs can provide an important test on our placements of g1 , g2 , and g3 on the hb .",
    "for example , for m5 , when the division of g1 and g2 is made properly at [ na / fe ] = 0.1 as suggested by @xcite , fig . 9 of @xcite shows that @xmath17  65  @xmath18 of stars in the red hb have g2 characteristic , while @xmath17  35  @xmath18 are in g1 regime .",
    "this is in agreement with the ratio of g2/g1 ( @xmath17  2 ; see fig .",
    "1 ) in the red hb of our model for m3-like gcs . for more metal - rich gcs",
    ", our models predict that the red hb is roughly equally populated by g1 and g2 , which agrees well with the na - o observations for ngc 1851 and ngc 2808 @xcite . for the blue hb stars",
    ", these observations confirm that they belong to na - rich and he - rich g3 .",
    "it is interesting to note that one rr lyrae variable in ngc 1851 was observed to be na - rich like blue hb stars ( g3 ) , which is consistent with our suggestion that ngc 1851 is a transition case between the oosterhoff i and iii . for the group ii gcs , the na - o observation of hb stars is available only for m22 @xcite , which shows that the blue hb stars right next to rr lyraes have g1 characteristic . while this is in qualitative agreement with our model for m15",
    ", the interpretation is more complicated as this gc was also affected by supernovae enrichment ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "certainly , spectroscopic observations for a large sample of rr lyrae and horizontal - branch stars in gcs representing two oosterhoff groups , such as m15 and m3 , are urgently required to confirm our models .",
