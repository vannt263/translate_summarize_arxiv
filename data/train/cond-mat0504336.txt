    "to summarize , using a generalized bogoliubov approach , we have calculated the collective excitation spectra of the cpt states involving atomic and stable molecular condensates .",

    ". it will be desirable in the future to extend this work to the inhomogeneous case where trapping potentials are present , as in typical experimental situations .",
    "nevertheless , our work here should provide important analytical insights into the much more complicated inhomogeneous problem , for which the only viable treatment is perhaps through numerical simulations .",
    "just as the usual cpt states in linear three - level @xmath55-systems are behind many important applications in quantum and atom optics @xcite , we anticipate that the nonlinear cpt states will also play important roles in applications where the coherence between atom and molecule condensates becomes critical .",
    "evidently , the success of these applications depends on our ability to avoid the unstable regimes of the cpt state .",
    "for example , high efficiency coherent population transfer between the atomic and molecular condensate using stirap can only be achieved if these unstable regimes are not encountered during the transfer process @xcite . with this in mind , we believe that our work will have important implications in the coupled atom - molecule condensates @xcite , a system of significant current interest , with ramifications in other nonlinear systems .",
