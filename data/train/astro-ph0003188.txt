    "more than twenty years of spacecraft observations in the heliosphere have proven that collisionless shocks can accelerate particles with high efficiency , i.e. , 10 - 50% of the ram energy can go into superthermal particles ( e.g. , eichler @xcite ; gosling et al.@xcite ; ellison et al .",
    "a recent example comes from terasawa et al .",
    "( @xcite ) who report on an interplanetary shock , observed by geotail , where the pressures in thermal and accelerated particles , and the magnetic field are in approximate equipartition in the foreshock .",
    "they observed that the shock transition was smoothed by the energetic particle backpressure , giving unambiguous evidence that nonlinear acceleration occurred in an interplanetary shock , weak by astrophysical standards ( for this exceptionally strong interplanetary shock , the sonic mach number was @xmath1 ) .",
    "energetic particles exist throughout the universe and shocks are commonly associated with them , confirming that shock acceleration is important beyond the heliosphere .",
    "in fact , shocks are believed to be the main source of galactic cosmic rays , and energetic particles from shocks may produce spectacular events such as @xmath0-ray bursts and x - ray and gamma - ray flaring in blazars .",
    "the shocks in these objects are expected to be much stronger than those in the heliosphere and can only be more efficient and nonlinear .",
    "the conjecture that collisionless shocks are efficient accelerators is strengthened by results from plasma simulations which show efficient shock acceleration consistent with spacecraft observations ( e.g. , scholer , trattner , & kucharek @xcite ; giacalone et al.@xcite ) .",
    "other indirect evidence comes from the implied efficiency of galactic cosmic ray production , radio emission from supernova remnants ( snrs ) ( see reynolds & ellison @xcite ) , equipartition arguments in agns and @xmath0-ray bursts , etc .",
    "( see blandford & eichler @xcite for an early review ) .",
    "there is also clear evidence that shocks can produce strong self - generated turbulence .",
    "this has long been seen in heliospheric shocks ( e.g. , lee @xcite , @xcite ; kennel et al .",
    "@xcite ; baring et al .",
    "@xcite ) and there is evidence that it occurs at snrs as well ( i.e. , achterberg , blandford , & reynolds @xcite ) .",
    "despite this compelling evidence for efficient , nonlinear shock acceleration , many astrophysical applications of shock acceleration continue to use the test - particle theory proposed more than 20 years ago by axford , leer , & skadron ( @xcite ) , krymskii ( @xcite ) , bell ( @xcite ) , and blandford & ostriker ( @xcite ) .",
    "we believe it is possible that test - particle models are used in situations where nonlinear shocks are clearly expected because the numerical , nonlinear results are complicated and unwieldy .",
    "none of the current techniques modeling nonlinear shocks have simple analytic approximations and this makes it difficult to perform parameter searches or compare nonlinear results to observations .    here , in an attempt to remedy this situation , we present a simple model of diffusive shock acceleration , based on more complete studies , which includes the essential physics of nonlinear acceleration when the backpressure from energetic ions modifies the shock structure and induces spectral curvature .",
    "this model is computationally fast and easy - to - use , but complete enough to be a valuable tool for interpreting observations .",
    "we also investigate some implications of efficient acceleration and the associated nonlinear effects on the modeling and interpretation of particle and photon observations of snrs , and include a detailed study of the broad - band continuum emission from the forward shock in sn1006 .",
    "our basic model is given in berezhko & ellison  ( @xcite ) where only protons are considered .",
    "here , we extend the model to include electrons and alpha particles , and calculate the broad - band , continuum photon emission from the ion and electron distributions ( ellison & berezhko @xcite ) . for protons , the injection process whereby some fraction of the shock",
    "heated plasma becomes accelerated to superthermal energies is , of necessity , parameterized but the model allows for the investigation of parameters against observations .",
    "unfortunately , the theory of electron injection and acceleration in shocks is on a less secure footing than for protons , so we are forced to use additional parameters for electron injection .",
    "helium is included without accounting for the enhancement effect known to occur for high mass to charge number ions ( e.g. , baring et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but this approximation has little effect on the results presented here .",
    "we claim our nonlinear model , in spite of its approximations and parameters , is far more physically meaningful than the test - particle power laws that are still routinely assumed by many workers as the outcome from shock acceleration . a crucial property of efficient , nonlinear shock acceleration is the interconnection of the entire particle distribution from thermal to the highest energies , and the linkage between protons and electrons . because energy is conserved , a change in the production efficiency of the highest energy cosmic rays _ must _ impact the thermal properties of the shock heated gas and vice versa . if more energy goes into relativistic particles , less is available to heat the gas .",
    "in contrast , the power laws assumed by test - particle models have no connection with the thermal gas , energy conservation does not constrain the normalization of the power law , and the spectral index can be changed with no feedback on the thermal plasma .",
    "the availability of an easy - to - use nonlinear shock acceleration model will have important implications for interpreting the broad - band emission from cosmic sources .",
    "in particular , the model presented here can efficiently explore parameter space to determine which quantities are the most dominant in controlling the spectral character and detectability of a remnant s emission in each waveband .",
    "the density of the ambient interstellar medium and the environmental magnetic field strength are the most interesting and critical parameters in this regard .",
    "it is clear that adjusting parameters to fit one component , say radio , changes the predicted fluxes at all other frequencies and most significantly in the x - ray band .",
    "based on constraints imposed by radio and @xmath0-ray observations , the simple model can distinguish , as a function of source model and environmental parameters , the relative contributions of synchrotron  ( from tev electrons ) and non - thermal bremsstrahlung  to the x - ray continuum .",
    "our model predicts the shape of the full , nonthermal electron spectrum and , for sources where non - thermal bremsstrahlung  is significant , x - ray line models may need to consider these non - thermal distributions .",
    "conversely , the model possesses the ability to predict tev fluxes given detections at other energies .",
    "one of the most perplexing developments of cosmic ray physics is the lack of clear detections of pion - decay photons from snrs .",
    "the original predictions of drury , aharonian , & vlk ( @xcite ) are well above current upper limits from egret and ground - based tev telescopes .",
    "it is almost universally assumed that supernova blast waves accelerate cosmic ray ions at least up to the `` knee '' near @xmath2 ev , and if so , these high energy ions will interact with the ambient gas and produce pions which will decay into gev and tev photons .",
    "the distinctive pion - decay bump was expected to be seen with current sensitivities and the lack of detection means there is still no direct evidence that snrs produce cosmic ray ions and is something of a concern for both theorists and builders of @xmath0-ray telescopes . since the detectability depends on source parameters , observers critically need selection criteria which reliably predict which snrs , observed at other frequencies , are likely to be bright at @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "this is particularly true for ground - based air erenkov telescopes which must devote weeks or even months observing a single position in the sky to obtain good statistics .",
    "as we show in our survey below , the model can provide these selection criteria .",
    "for most of the cases we have studied , supernov  which explode in low - density , low magnetic field regions have the largest tev to radio flux ratios .",
    "the model of berezhko & ellison ( @xcite ) synthesizes the essential features of two complimentary approaches to nonlinear shock acceleration , namely the semi - analytical diffusion equation method of berezhko et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and others ( e.g. , kang & jones @xcite , @xcite ) and the monte carlo technique of e.g. , ellison et al.(@xcite ) .",
    "the premise of the model of berezhko & ellison is that the main aspects of time - dependent , nonlinear shock acceleration can be understood in the framework of a plane - wave , steady - state assumption with simple approximations for the accelerated particle spectrum .",
    "an essential element of nonlinear acceleration is particle escape and ellison & berezhko ( @xcite ) showed ( and we confirm here ) that the dynamic effects of particle escape are essentially the same in a plane - wave , steady - state shock as in an evolving , spherical shock .",
    "the two very different scenarios agree because the process of particle decoupling ( i.e. , escape ) from shocks at high energies produces the same shock modification and increased compression ratio in the evolving , spherical shock solution , where particle ` escape ' is mimicked by energy ` dilution ' in the ever expanding upstream volume , as it does in the plane - wave approximation , where particles leave at a maximum cutoff energy or a free - escape - boundary ( feb ) .",
    "the essential point is that particle escape from strong shocks is a _ fundamental part _ of the nonlinear acceleration process and is determined primarily by energy and momentum conservation , not time - dependence or a particular geometry .",
    "the injection efficiency , together with the ` shock size ' ( however it may be determined ) , set the shock structure and determine the overall acceleration efficiency .",
    "in other words , in a real , finite sized shock , geometry is important for determining the maximum value of momentum , @xmath3 , where the spectrum cuts off , and particle escape comes about naturally . in the plane - wave approximation",
    ", escape is parameterized with a feb , but the model can still be used to good effect with this restriction .",
    "similarly , since the majority of particles accelerated by an expanding snr blast wave typically have acceleration times which are much shorter than the time scale of the system ( in fact , even the highest energy particles expected in snrs have acceleration times a few times shorter than the remnant age , e.g. , berezhko @xcite ) , a steady - state approximation can be used for modeling the particles accelerated by a strongly modified shock . we give a quantitative verification of this claim in ellison & berezhko ( @xcite ) , and",
    "demonstrate it below in detail for the snr sn1006 .",
    "the non - linearity of the acceleration process in high mach number shocks is manifested through the feedback of the ions on the spatial profile of the flow velocity ( e.g. , drury @xcite ; jones & ellison @xcite ) , which in turn determines the particle distribution .",
    "the accelerated population presses on the upstream plasma and slows it .",
    "an upstream precursor forms , in which the flow speed ( in the absence of instabilities ) is monotonically decreasing . the net effect that emerges is one where the overall compression ratio , @xmath4 , from far upstream to far downstream of the subshock discontinuity , exceeds that obtained in the test - particle scenario , while the subshock compression ratio , @xmath5 , which is mainly responsible for heating the gas , is less than the test - particle compression .",
    "this phenomenon was identified by eichler ( @xcite ) , and ellison & eichler ( @xcite ) , and arises for two reasons .",
    "the most important is that particle escape from strong shocks drains energy and pressure which must be compensated for by ramping up the overall compression ratio to conserve the fluxes .",
    "the second reason is that relativistic particles , with their softer equation of state , contribute significantly to the total pressure making the shocked plasma more compressible .",
    "since particle diffusion lengths are generally increasing functions of momentum ( e.g. , giacalone et al.@xcite ; scholer , kucharek , & giacalone @xcite ) , high momentum particles sample a broader portion of the flow velocity profile , and hence experience larger compression ratios than low momentum particles .",
    "consequently , higher momentum particles have a flatter power - law index than those at lower momenta , thereby dominating the pressure in a nonlinear fashion and producing a concave upward spectral curvature which is the trademark of nonlinear shock acceleration .",
    "it is precisely this spectral concavity that can be compactly approximated by the simple model of berezhko & ellison ( @xcite ) .",
    "berezhko & ellison assume that the accelerated part of the shocked particle phase - space distribution , @xmath6 , above a superthermal injection momentum , @xmath7 , can be described as a three - component power law : @xmath8^{-{q_{\\mathrm{int } } } } & if \\ \\",

    "the far upstream sonic mach number is @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the adiabatic index of the shocked gas excluding cosmic rays , and the normalization factors are @xmath18^{{q_{\\mathrm{sub}}}}$ ] , and @xmath19 .",
    "the full explanation of these terms ( including the normalization @xmath20 in terms of input parameters ) is given in berezhko & ellison ( @xcite ) , but for here it is only necessary to state that the nonlinear spectrum can be determined with four arbitrary parameters : ( 1 ) @xmath7 , ( 2 ) the rate of proton injection , @xmath21 , ( 3 ) the maximum momentum , @xmath3 , where the spectrum cuts off , and ( 4 ) @xmath22 .",
    "the results are relatively insensitive to @xmath22 which we take as @xmath23 if @xmath24 or @xmath25 otherwise , and @xmath7 and @xmath21 are related , leaving essentially two free parameters to describe the proton spectrum ( here and elsewhere , @xmath26 is the proton rest mass ) . in this steady - state description , the proton injection _",
    "rate _ , @xmath21 ( berezhko et al .",
    "use the notation @xmath27 ) , is equivalent to the fraction of total shocked proton number density , @xmath28 , in protons with momentum @xmath29 .",
    "the scheme we adopt for determining the scale length that fixes @xmath3 is described in section  3.1 .",
    "the thermal portion of the downstream spectrum is taken to be a maxwell - boltzmann distribution at the shocked temperature and density , i.e. , @xmath30 , where the downstream pressure , @xmath31 , and downstream density , @xmath32 , are determined by the solution , i.e. , they couple to the shock dynamics .",
    "no extra parameters are required to specify the thermal portion of the proton distribution other than to assume it is maxwell - boltzmann . in figure",
    "[ fig : ebfive ] ( fig .  5 from berezhko & ellison  @xcite )",
    ", we compare results from the simple model with those of a monte carlo  shock simulation used as a reference .",
    "the monte carlo  simulation calculates the entire spectrum from thermal energies upward and has an internally consistent determination of the injection efficiency .",
    "using this value of @xmath21 in the simple model ( the solid triangle is at @xmath7 ) gives an excellent match between the two techniques .",
    "the extremely high compression ratios occur because only adiabatic heating of the shock precursor is assumed .",
    "when alfvn  wave heating is included ( as it is in all of the results presented below except those shown in figure  [ fig : fpdjde ] ) , considerably smaller @xmath4 s result ( see berezhko & ellison @xcite for a discussion of alfvn  wave heating ) . ) in an approximate way by adding a pressure contribution equal to @xmath33 times the energetic proton pressure .",
    "this neglects any enhancement effects for heavy ions , but these could be incorporated in the simple model with a parameterization such as used by berezhko & ksenofontov ( @xcite ) .",
    "based on the work of baring et al.(@xcite ) , we expect the contribution of helium to the pion - decay emission to be no more than 50% of the proton contribution . ]      before describing how electrons are treated in our simple model , we note that electron injection is harder to characterize than proton injection for several fundamental reasons .",
    "one stems from the basic point that the shock structure is determined almost totally by the ions , since they carry most of the momentum , so general considerations of momentum and energy conservation constrain their behavior .",
    "internally - consistent models of ion injection can be developed without a detailed knowledge of the complex plasma processes , and these models have been shown to match spacecraft observations of ion acceleration at heliospheric shocks ( e.g. , ellison , mbius , & paschmann @xcite ; baring et al.@xcite ) and hybrid simulations ( e.g. , giacalone et al.@xcite ) .",
    "electrons , on the other hand , carry little momentum and do nt influence the shock structure substantially so they act basically as test particles . because of this , their injection and acceleration efficiencies ( at nonrelativistic energies at least ) are sensitive to the details of the complex wave - particle plasma interactions , which are not well understood .",
    "furthermore , since protons determine the overall shock dynamics , plasma simulations wishing to describe electrons self - consistently must include protons self - consistently as well , forcing prohibitively large ranges in time and length scales .",
    "compounding the problem , spacecraft observations of heliospheric shocks have not until very recently ( i.e. , terasawa et al.@xcite ) detected the injection and acceleration of _ thermal _ electrons .",
    "this , in contrast to the many observations of thermal proton injection and acceleration , has made it impossible to infer the properties of electron injection and acceleration from in situ observations , or even , until recently , confirm that diffusive shock acceleration of electrons from the thermal background takes place .    in order to include electrons in the simple model we note that particles with the same upstream diffusion length , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath36 is the far upstream shock speed ) , have the same acceleration rate .",
    "that is , electrons and protons will obtain the same spectral shape if they have the same diffusion coefficient @xmath37 in a considered momentum range .",
    "since the diffusion coefficient @xmath38 depends not only on the particle rigidity , @xmath39 , but also on their speed , @xmath40 , which is different for electrons and protons at @xmath411  gev@xmath42 , one might conclude that , in general , the shapes of the accelerated electron and proton spectra are different .",
    "however , it is easy to show that the electron and proton spectral shapes should , in fact , be very similar at superthermal energies . at relativistic energies , @xmath43 , the interaction with the magnetic field of electrons and protons of the same gyroradius ( or rigidity )",
    "is indistinguishable if we assume any effects from helicity are insignificant .",
    "therefore , the shape of the electron spectrum , @xmath44 , at @xmath45 is the same as the proton spectrum , @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , to the accuracy of the simple proton model , where we assume that protons with @xmath47 have speed @xmath48 , and those with @xmath49 have speed @xmath50 , the spectral shapes will be the same for all @xmath51 .",
    "to the same accuracy , electrons with momenta @xmath49 have smaller diffusion lengths than protons at @xmath52 and they ` feel ' only part of the shock transition , i.e. , the subshock as assumed in the simple model .",
    "therefore , just as we assume for the protons , the spectrum of accelerated electrons at @xmath53 can be approximated by the power law @xmath54 , independent of the diffusion coefficient @xmath55 , as long as @xmath35 is an increasing function of momentum .",
    "thus within the accuracy of the simple model , @xmath56 at all superthermal energies , where the value of the numerical factor , @xmath57 , is determined by the relation between the electron and proton injection rates , i.e. , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : threepower ] ) we have @xmath58^{{q_{\\mathrm{sub}}}}$ ] , where the subscripts @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote electrons and protons , respectively .",
    "unfortunately there are no reliable theoretical predictions for this relation so we parameterize it .",
    "we remark that if the damping of high frequency waves near thermal energies is strong enough to inhibit electron scattering , there will exist a range of suprathermal electron momenta where the electron diffusion coefficient and length are larger than the proton ones , i.e. , @xmath61 ( e.g. , levinson @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this case is considered in baring et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , where the _ in_efficient scattering of electrons causes their diffusion lengths to lengthen and _ increases _ their steady - state injection efficiencies .",
    "if this is the case , the electron spectra in the sub - gev range may be quite different from those shown here and these differences can be particularly relevant to radio synchrotron and nonthermal bremsstrahlung  emission .    if we make the specific assumption that the scattering mean free path is @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a parameter independent of particle momentum ( baring et al.@xcite , use the notation @xmath27 ) , @xmath64 is the gyroradius in si units , @xmath65 is the gyroradius at the maximum momentum , @xmath3 , and @xmath66 is a constant parameter ( @xmath67 is roughly the bohm limit ) , then electrons and protons which satisfy , @xmath68 obtain the same spectral shape . since we obtain the proton spectrum from the simple model , and if we assume that @xmath63 is the same for electrons and protons , eq .",
    "( [ eq : momspec ] ) allows us to determine the electron spectrum by finding the momenta dividing the three - component power law , i.e. , the intervals where @xmath9 , @xmath69 , and @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : threepower ] ) apply .",
    "we note that the above is just for concreteness and that , within the approximations of our simple model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : elecproton ] ) holds and we do not have to make any specific assumptions concerning the form of the particle diffusion coefficient other than that it is a monotonically increasing function of momentum .    in the top panel of figure  [ fig : fpdjde ]",

    "@xcite ) in the 110 gev range .",
    "the final parameter needed to completely specify the electron spectrum is the shocked electron to proton temperature ratio , @xmath74 , for which there is considerable latitude given uncertainties in the shock speed and other parameters for individual snrs that leaves @xmath75 ill - determined observationally .",

    "for the test - particle case ( column labeled sn1006@xmath236 in table  1 ) : @xmath237 , @xmath238 , and @xmath239 k , while for the nonlinear case : @xmath240 , @xmath241 , and @xmath242 k. in the nonlinear case , the shocked density is @xmath243% _ greater _ and the shocked temperature is more than a factor of 3 _ less _ than the test - particle result .",
    "furthermore , the nonlinear electron spectrum in figure  [ fig : testpart ] shows a stronger nonthermal tail on the thermal peak ( comparison between the dotted and dot - dashed curves in figure  [ fig : fpdjde ] gives a much more extreme example ) .",
    "accurate electron temperatures and knowledge of the presence of significant nonthermal electron distributions are of prime importance for modeling x - ray line emission from shock heated gas ( e.g. , hamilton et al.@xcite ) .",
    "line models depend strongly on the assumed electron temperature and density and may change substantially if cosmic rays are accelerated with efficiencies typical of the example just given .",
    "dorfi & bhringer ( @xcite ) ( see also dorfi @xcite ) calculate the evolution of snrs including cosmic ray production and find examples where @xmath244 of the explosion energy is transferred to cosmic rays , reducing the x - ray emission by a factor of 20 from test - particle predictions .",
    "efficiencies nearly this high are found by berezhko , ksenofontov , & petukhov ( @xcite,@xcite ) and are typical of those shown here in table  1 .",
    "the four - component sum of the photon emission from the test - particle result for sn1006 is shown as the heavy dotted curve in figure  [ fig : sn1006 ] where the emission volume has been adjusted to fit the radio flux .",
    "the broad - band fit is unsatisfactory and does not improve substantially if parameters other than @xmath21 are varied . in the test - particle result , the x - ray emission is dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung  and the tev to radio flux ratio is much smaller than in the nonlinear result .",
    "we have developed a computationally fast and easy - to - use model of nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration along with the accompanying photon emission from the resultant electron and ion spectra . using this model",
    ", we showed how the emission depends on both model and environmental parameters and identified ambient density and magnetic field as being the most important in determining the broad - band emission .",
    "we also showed that our simple model is in excellent agreement with a more complete and complex model of the supernova remnant sn1006 .",
    "a particularly important aspect of nonlinear acceleration is that shock _ heating _ is linked to particle acceleration and thus to the broad - band photon emission . as shown in figures  [ fig : fpdjde ] , [ fig : paramodel]a , and [ fig : testpart ] , shocks which accelerate particles efficiently have lower postshock temperatures and higher postshock densities than test - particle predictions .",
    "nonlinear shocks also produce electron spectra with superthermal tails ( figures  [ fig : fpdjde ] , [ fig : snrcomp ] , and [ fig : testpart ] ) .",
    "these factors are important for x - ray line emission ( e.g. , dorfi & bhringer @xcite ) and open up the possibility of using radio , x - ray continuum , and @xmath0-ray observations to constrain x - ray line models and vice versa .",
    "we believe the model we present here is a first step in this process .",
    "to describe snrs , we use a model of an expanding , spherical shock wave ( truelove & mckee @xcite ) to obtain shock parameters as a function of snr parameters and time . using these parameters ,",
    "we calculate nonlinear particle soectra and produce `` snapshot '' continuum photon spectra from synchrotron , bremsstrahlung , inverse - compton , and pion - decay , spanning the range from radio to tev @xmath0-rays . more realistic models would include inhomogeneous ejecta , emission from dense clumps , pre - sn winds , a reverse shock , volume integrated emission from regions undergoing adiabatic cooling , oblique shock geometry , and effects on the snr evolution from particle escape ( or dilution ) .",
    "some of these additions have already been performed by berezhko , ksenofontov , & petukhov ( @xcite ) and our results are in excellent agreement with theirs for sn1006 ( figure  [ fig : sn1006 ] and section  [ sec : berecompare ] ) , some can be added easily to the simple model , but others ( such as oblique geometry ) are much more difficult . despite this , we believe this nonlinear model is accurate enough to approximate expected emission fluxes and clearly track important trends as we describe in detail in section  [ sec : keyparameters ] .",
    "nonlinear shock acceleration unavoidably involves a large number of model and environmental parameters and it is essential to know how they relate to each other and which ones have the greatest impact on the results . of the model parameters ,",
    "the injection efficiency , @xmath21 , has the greatest influence on the solutions since it sets the overall efficiency and determines whether the acceleration is nonlinear or can be treated as test particle ( figures  [ fig : fpdjde ] and [ fig : paramodel]a ) .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath21 is not well constrained by theory and heliospheric observations remain limited ; in fact , there s virtually no constraining information on the efficiency of high mach number shocks like those expected in young snrs . however , the differences between test - particle and nonlinear predictions are so large in both the broad - band continuum and the x - ray line emission , that we believe it will be possible to set strong constraints on the acceleration efficiency once nonlinear models of x - ray line emission become available . other model parameters , such as the ratios of shocked electron to proton temperature and of electron to proton acceleration efficiency , are less fundamental but produce characteristic differences in the emission which can be constrained with sufficiently complete models and observations ( figures  [ fig : paramodel]b and c ) .",
    "the environmental parameters include the ambient interstellar proton density @xmath155 and density profile , the magnetic field @xmath129 , the ejecta mass and density profile , supernova explosion energy , etc .",
    "of these , the ambient density and magnetic field have , by far , the largest effect on the broad - band emission . as we show in figures  [ fig : snrcomp ] , [ fig : parainputsens ] , and [ fig : tevtoradio ] , varying @xmath155 and @xmath129 produce a complicated set of changes in the emission which can not be simply characterized . if density is held constant , the intensity in the radio band scales roughly as @xmath245 , but at photon energies @xmath246 mev , the intensity can decrease with increasing @xmath129 due to nonlinear effects ( figure  [ fig : parainputsens]b ) and a weakening of the shock ( i.e. , decrease in the alfvn  mach number ) . likewise , when @xmath129 is fixed , an increase in density generally causes an increase in emission in the mev range , but the emission in the radio band is relatively insensitive to density ( figure  [ fig : parainputsens]a ) .",
    "at tev energies , the maximum photon energy increases as @xmath155 is decreased and , in general , the highest photon energies are obtained with the largest @xmath129 and the lowest @xmath155 . the tev / radio flux ratio , however , is greatest for low ambient magnetic fields ( figure  [ fig : tevtoradio ] ) and this is an important parameter if radio snrs are selected for hard @xmath0-ray searches .",
    "as we show in figure  [ fig : ic_pp ] , the distinctive pion - decay bump will be most prominent for remnants in high @xmath155 and high @xmath129 environments ; given the flux levels predicted , we anticipate positive detections of such spectral features ( generally below egret sensitivities for @xmath247 @xmath140 ) , by the glast experiment in the not too distant future .",
    "while tev experiments can not probe such spectral features , they can detect the upper range of pion decay emission in remnants in high @xmath129 surroundings ; this situation may already be realized in the recent announcement ( vlk et al .",
    "2000 ) of a positive detection of cas a by hegra .",
    "the nature of the x - ray emission also depends importantly on density and magnetic field . as density",
    "is increased at a given @xmath129 , the kev x - ray emission goes from being totally dominated by synchrotron  from relativistic electrons to quasi - thermal bremsstrahlung  emission .",
    "note that the bremsstrahlung  dominates even in the radio band for @xmath218 @xmath140and @xmath248 @xmath127g(fig .",
    "[ fig : parainputsens]a ) .",
    "similarly , at a given density ( figure  [ fig : parainputsens]b ) , the x - ray emission goes from being thermal bremsstrahlung  to synchrotron  as @xmath129 increases . if synchrotron  is dominant , x - ray lines will be weak or absent so these differences are readily distinguishable observationally .    finally , we suggest that the most important aspect of modeling photon emission from astrophysical shocks depends on whether or not the acceleration is efficient and nonlinear or inefficient and test - particle in nature",
    ". these situations can be quite different and if the acceleration is nonlinear , all parameters are interconnected and observations in any energy band limit the freedom to vary parameters in all other bands .",
    "since there are a large number of parameters , understanding the nonlinear interactions requires a model that can efficiently map parameter space .",
    "we believe the model presented here , while not a replacement for more complete models , can do this expediently and accurately and be an aid in interpreting the vast amount of information expected from current and future space and ground - based telescopes .",
