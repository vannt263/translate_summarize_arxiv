    "the measurement of the rotation curves ( rcs ) of disk galaxies is a powerful tool to investigate the nature of dark matter ( dm ) , including its content relative to the baryonic components and their distributions . in particular , dwarf galaxies are good candidates to reach this aim as their kinematics are generally dominated by the dark component , down to small galactocentric radii @xcite .",
    "this leads to a reliable measurement of the dynamical contribution of the dm to the rc and hence of its density profile .",
    "therefore , a dwarf galaxy like the orion dwarf provides us with an important test as to whether dm density profiles arising in @xmath3 cold dark matter ( @xmath3cdm ) numerical simulations @xcite are compatible with those detected in actual dm halos around galaxies .",
    "let us comment that nfw profile arises from pure n - body dm simulations .",
    "it is well known that , as effect of the baryonic infall in the cosmological dm halos and of the subsequest process of stellar disk formation , shallower profiles of the dm halo may arise ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recent studies of the rcs of dwarf galaxies have tested the nfw scenario .",
    "it is now clear that kinematic data are better fitted by a dm halo with a constant density core ( e.g. @xcite ) , than by one that is centrally peaked .",
    "one specific example is ddo 47 , whose velocity field is clearly best fitted if the dm halo is cored ; moreover , its ( small ) detected non - circular motions can not account for the discrepancy between data and the nfw predictions @xcite .",
    "+ the present investigation examines the dm content of the orion dwarf galaxy .",
    "this nearby system harbors an extended  disk , and thus provides us with an important test of the above paradigm .",
    "as we show below , the orion dwarf is one of the few known galaxies whose kinematics _ unambiguously _ point towards a cored profile .",
    "this system is thus critically important for investigating the nature of the dm particle and of the evolution of dm halos .",
    "+ mond accounts for the evidence that rcs of spiral galaxies are inconsistent with the corresponding distribution of the luminous matter @xcite . rather than postulating the existence of a dark halo made by massive collisionless elementary particles",
    ", this scenario advocates that the gravitational force at low accelerations leaves the standard newtonian regime to enter a very different one .",
    "historically mond has generally been successful in reproducing the rcs of spiral galaxies with only the ( observed ) luminous matter ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , cases of tension between data and the mond formalism do exist @xcite . + it is important to stress that in order to derive the dm density profile or to test the mond formalism , we must know the distribution of the ordinary baryonic components , as well as have reliable measurements of the gas kinematics . for the orion dwarf , 21-cm  surface brightness and kinematics",
    "have recently been published @xcite : their analysis provides a high quality , high resolution rc , that , in addition , can be easily corrected for asymmetric drift and tested for non - circular motions .",
    "this galaxy is a very useful laboratory in that a simple inspection of the rc ensures us that it shows a large mass discrepancy at all radii .",
    "moreover , the baryonic components are efficiently modeled ( i.e. , no stellar bulge is evident and the stellar disk shows a well - behaved exponential profile , see @xcite ) .",
    "the distance to the galaxy , which is critical for an unambiguous test of mond @xcite , is estimated to be 5.4@xmath41.0 mpc @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that the distance of the orion dwarf remains a significant source of uncertainty .",
    "@xcite estimate the distance using the brightest stars method .",
    "the intrinsic uncertainty in this technique may allow a distance ambiguity much larger than the formal errors estimated by @xcite , because in their work this method yields a scatter as large as @xmath5 in distance . finally , the system s inclination ( 47@xmath1 ) is kinematically measured ( see section ( [ 3.1 ] ) ) and is high enough to not affect the estimate of the circular velocity . the properties described above",
    "make the orion dwarf galaxy an attractive candidate to determine the underlying gravitational potential of the galaxy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we present the stellar surface photometry . in sec .",
    "3 , the  surface density and kinematics data are presented and discussed ; we also provide the analysis of possible non - circular motions of the neutral gas . in sec .",
    "4 we model the rc in the stellar disk using a cored / cusped halo framework . in sec .",
    "5 we test the orion kinematics against the mond formalism .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "following the discussion in @xcite , the underlying stellar mass in the orion dwarf is estimated using the near - infrared ( ir ) photometry ( j and  bands ) presented by @xcite .",
    "those authors find ( j@xmath6 ) @xmath0 @xmath20.80 and a total  magnitude of @xmath210.90 .",
    "when comparing to models ( see below ) we assume that the color difference between k and  is negligible ; further , we assume l@xmath73.33 @xcite . accounting for extinction ,",
    "the total k - band luminosity of the orion dwarf is @xmath83.5@xmath910@xmath10 l@xmath11 .",
    "the mass of the stellar component was estimated by @xcite to be ( 3.7@xmath41.5)@xmath910@xmath12 .",
    "the stellar surface brightness profile is well fitted by an exponential thin disk , with a scale length of @xmath13= 25  @xmath4 1  ( equivalent to 1.33 @xmath4 0.05 kpc at the adopted distance )",
    ". moreover , there are no departures from an exponential profile that would be indicative of a prominent central bulge .",
    "spectral line imaging was acquired with the _ very large array _ and presented in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to that work for a full discussion of the data handling , and we summarize salient details here .",
    "the final data cubes have a circular beam size of 20 , with a 3@xmath14  column density sensitivity of n@xmath15= 1.5 @xmath910@xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "the first three moment maps ( i.e. the integrated  intensity , the velocity field , and the velocity dispersion ) are shown in figure ( [ figcap3 ] ) .",
    "+ the neutral gas disk of the orion dwarf shows rich morphological and kinematic structure at this physical resolution .",
    "the outer disk contains tenuous  gas , but column densities rise above the 5@xmath910@xmath18 @xmath17 level at intermediate radii .",
    "there is plentiful high - column density ( @xmath1910@xmath20 @xmath17 )  throughout the disk .",
    "the more or less parallel iso - velocity contours at inner radii are indicative of linear rotation ( although almost certainly not solid body ) and the curving of the outer contours suggests that the outer rotation curve has a fairly constant velocity .",
    "the outer disk contours show no evidence for a decrease in rotational velocity at large radii . in the central regions of the disk , however , some  `` holes '' or `` depressions '' manifest a pronounced kink in these contours ( consider the contours at 370@xmath420 ) .",
    "the intensity weighted velocity dispersion averages to @xmath87 - 8  throughout the disk , although the innermost regions show dispersions above 10 .",
    "+ the total  flux integral , proportional to the  disk mass , was found to be 50.3@xmath45.1 jykm s@xmath21 , a value somewhat lower than the single - dish flux measure of 80.6@xmath47.72 jykm s@xmath21 by @xcite ; the difference may arise from the lack of short interferometric spacings that provide sensitivity to diffuse structure .",
    "the total mass is found to be m@xmath15 @xmath0 ( 3.5@xmath40.5)@xmath910@xmath22 . after applying the usual 35% correction for helium and molecular material ,",
    "we adopt m@xmath23 @xmath0 ( 4.7@xmath40.7)@xmath910@xmath22 as the total gas mass .",
    "+ in figure ( [ reswri ] ) we plot the 10  /20  resolution  surface density , throughout the gas disk .",
    "a simple fit ( valid out to the last measured point and for the scope of this work ) yields : _",
    "m_/pc^2 , where @xmath24 is in kpc .",
    "the related fitting uncertainty on @xmath25 is about @xmath26 .",
    "figure ( [ reswri ] ) shows that the  surface density rises from the center of the galaxy , reaches a maximum , and then declines exponentially . at the last measured point ,",
    "i.e. out to @xmath8 7 kpc , the profile has almost ( though not completely ) reached the edge of the  disk and rapidly converges to zero .",
    "note that , in newtonian gravity , the outer gaseous disk contributes in a negligible way to the galaxy total gravitational potential .",
    "the channel maps of the orion dwarf provide evidence of well - ordered rotation throughout the  disk ( see cannon et al .",
    "the intensity - weighted - mean velocity field ( figure ( [ figcap3]b ) ) exhibits symmetric structure in the outer disk .",
    "twisted iso - velocity contours at inner radii coincide with the  holes near the centre of the disk . the disk is therefore dominated by circular motion .",
    "the rc of the galaxy was derived by fitting a tilted ring model to the intensity - weighted - mean velocity field using the gipsy task rotcur .",
    "the routine carries out a least - squares fit to @xmath27 , the line of sight - velocity . to derive the best - fitting model , an iterative approach was adopted in which the various combinations of the parameters were fitted .",
    "the final rc was extract by fixing all other parameters .",
    "the receding and approaching sides of the galaxy were fitted separately .",
    "the best fitting parameters are @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30  km / s , and ( @xmath31,@xmath32 ) = ( 05:45:01.66 , 05:03:55.2 ) for the dynamical centre .",
    "we have realized that the inclination is not dependent on the radius , and the fit is shown in figure ( [ inclination ] ) .",
    "its weighted value is @xmath33 .",
    "notice that because the errors reported by gipsy / rotcur include only errors on the fits and systematics are not included , the @xmath34 error estimate comes from attempting the rotcur fits in various orders ( e.g. , holding each variable fixed in turn ) .",
    "+ the resulting rc is shown in figure ( [ asymm ] ) . notice that in this object the disk inclination is determined kinematically and therefore it is quite accurate .",
    "no result of this paper changes by adopting different values of @xmath35 , inside the quoted errorbar .",
    "the second - order moment map for the galaxy is shown in figure ( [ figcap3]c ) . throughout most of the disk ,",
    "the velocity dispersion is roughly constant at @xmath14 @xmath36 7@xmath42 km / s , with a more complex behaviour near the galaxy centre and at the outermost radii .",
    "this velocity dispersion estimate allows us to derive the asymmetric drift correction to the rc yielded by the tilted ring model . the observed rotation velocity , @xmath37 , is related to the circular velocity @xmath38 via v^2_c(r)= v^2_rot(r ) - ^2(r )   . [ circ ]    from an examination of figure ( [ asymm ] ) it is clear that the @xmath37 and @xmath38 profiles differ by less than 1@xmath39 .",
    "throughout this paper , we use the latter for the purposes of mass modelling .",
    "we notice that in very small dwarfs this correction is not negligible ( @xmath40 ) and it introduces an uncertainty in the analysis , e.g. @xcite .    in summary",
    ", the orion dwarf rc has a spatial resolution of 0.26 kpc ( i.e. 0.2 @xmath13 ) , and extends out to 5.1 r@xmath41 .",
    "the uncertainties on the rc are few km / s and the error on the rc slope @xmath42 .",
    "is the circular velocity given by eq .",
    "( [ circ ] ) a proper estimate of the gravitational field ? to further investigate the presence of non - circular motions within the disk that jeopardize the kinematics , we carried out a harmonic decomposition of the intensity - weighted velocity field to search for any significant non - circular components .",
    "this test is necessary in that the undetected presence of non - circular motions can lead to incorrect parametrization of the total mass distribution .",
    "+ following @xcite , the line - of - sight velocities from the  velocity field are decomposed into harmonic components up to order @xmath43 according to @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the systemic velocity , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the magnitudes of the harmonic components , @xmath48 the harmonic number , and @xmath49 the azimuthal angle in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the gipsy task reswri was used to carry out the decomposition by fitting a purely circular model to the velocity field , subtracting it from the data , and then determining from the residual the magnitudes of the non - circular components . the tilted ring model fitted by reswri had its kinematic centre fixed to that of the purely circular tilted ring model used to derive the rc above .",
    "the position angles and inclinations were fixed to constant values of 20 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the parameters of the best - fitting model are shown in figure ( [ reswri4 ] ) .",
    "adjacent points are separated by a beam width in order to ensure that they are largely independent of one another .",
    "we argue that because the standard tilted ring model has fewer free parameters than the model incorporating the higher order fourier components , it is not as essential to space the points on the rotation curve by a full beam width .",
    "then in this model only @xmath51 points are considered instead of the @xmath52 points used in fitting the rc . + at inner radii the inferred non - circular motions are not negligible , but this is almost certainly due to the fact that the  distribution over this portion of the disk is irregular , being dominated by the large central  under - densities .",
    "the harmonic components of the outer disk are , instead , reliable and demonstrate the gas flow to be dominated by circular kinematics .",
    "the circular velocity so obtained well matches that found by means of the tilted ring model presented above .",
    "the amplitudes of @xmath53 and @xmath54 are too small to hide a cusp inside an apparently solid body rc ( as suggested by @xcite ) .",
    "these results provide further decisive support for the use of @xmath37 of the orion dwarf as a tracer of its mass distribution .",
    "we model the orion dwarf as consisting of two `` luminous '' components , namely the stellar and the gaseous disks , embedded in a dark halo .",
    "the stellar component is modelled as an exponential thin disk @xcite with a scale length of 1.33  kpc .",
    "any bulge component is assumed to be negligible in terms of mass .",
    "the dynamical contribution of the gas to the observed rc is derived from the  total intensity map .",
    "a scaling factor of 1.33 is incorporated to account for the presence of helium and other elements . for the dark halo we consider two different parametrizations of the mass distribution : an nfw profile @xcite and the cored profile of the halo universal rotation curve ( urch ) @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the nfw profile is one outcome in numerical simulations of cold dark matter structure formation , whereas the cored profile ( an empirical result ) , by design , fits the broad range of rc shapes of spiral galaxies .",
    "the rc is modelled as the quadrature sum of the rcs of the individual mass components :    @xmath55    for the cored halo parametrization we adopt the urch profile : v^2_urch(r)&=&6.4 , where the disk mass , the core radius @xmath56 and the central halo density @xmath57 are free parameters .",
    "it is evident that this model yields a total rc that fits the data extremely well ( see figure ( [ urcnfw ] ) left panel ) , with best - fitting parameters of @xmath58 kpc , m@xmath59 m@xmath60  and @xmath61g/@xmath62 .",
    "more accurate statistics is not necessary ; the mass model predicts all the @xmath63 data points within their observational uncertainty .",
    "notice that the derived value of the disk mass agrees with the photometric estimate discussed above .",
    "the corresponding virial mass and radius of the dm halo are m@xmath64 m@xmath60 ( see eq . 10 in @xcite ) and r@xmath65 kpc @xcite , respectively .",
    "we note that the orion dwarf has a mass 20 times smaller than that of the milky way , with the dm halo dominating the gravitational potential at all galactocentric radii .",
    "the baryonic fraction is @xmath66 , while the gas fraction is @xmath67 .",
    "the rc for the nfw dark matter profile is v^2_nfw(r)=v^2_vir , where @xmath68 , @xmath69^{-1}$ ] and @xmath70 is the concentration parameter ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we fitted the rc of the orion dwarf by adjusting m@xmath71 and m@xmath72 .",
    "the resulting best - fit values are m@xmath73 m@xmath60 and m@xmath74 m@xmath60 , but since @xmath75 , i.e. the fit is unsuccessful , the best - fit values of the free parameters and those of their fitting uncertainties do not have a clear physical meaning .",
    "we plot the results in the right panel of figure ( [ urcnfw ] ) .",
    "the nfw model , at galactocentric radii r@xmath762 kpc , overestimates the observed circular velocity ( see figure ( [ urcnfw ] ) right panel ) .",
    "an alternative to newtonian gravity was proposed by @xcite to explain the phenomenon of mass discrepancy in galaxies .",
    "it was suggested that the true acceleration @xmath77 of a test particle , at low accelerations , is different from the standard newtonian acceleration , @xmath78 :    a= , where @xmath79 is an interpolation function and @xmath80 cm s@xmath81 is the critical acceleration at which the transition occurs ( see @xcite ) . for this",
    "we adopt the following form of the interpolation function ( see @xcite ) : ( a / a_0)=.    in this framework the circular velocity profile can be expressed as a function of @xmath82 and of the standard newtonian contribution of the baryons to the rc , v@xmath83=(v@xmath84+v@xmath85)@xmath86 , obtaining for it v^2_mond = v^2_bar(r ) ( ) , [ mond ] ( see @xcite )",
    "( [ mond ] ) shows that in the mond framework the resulting rc is similar to the no - dm standard newtonian one , with an additional term that works to mimic and substitute for the dm component @xcite .",
    "no result of this paper changes by adopting the `` standard '' mond interpolation function ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the best - fitting mond mass model is shown in figure ( [ mond1 ] ) .",
    "the model total rc ( cyan line ) completely fails to match the observations .",
    "we fix the stellar mass m@xmath41 at m@xmath87 .",
    "if we let the disk mass becomes higher , covering the mass range estimated in @xcite , the fit is not even able to reproduce the rc at inner radii .",
    "note that in the mond formalism , the distance of the galaxy and the amount of gaseous mass are both crucial in deriving the model rc . to quantify the discrepancy of these observations with the mond formalism , note that only if the orion dwarf were 1.9 times more distant than the current estimate we would obtain a satisfactory fit to the rc ( see figure ( [ mond2 ] ) ) .",
    "the orion dwarf galaxy is representative of a population of dwarfs with a steep inner rc that gently flattens at the edge of the gas disk .",
    "the observed kinematics imply the presence of large amounts of dm also in the central regions .",
    "we have used new  observations of the orion dwarf to analize its kinematics and derive the mass model .",
    "the derived rc is very steep and it is dominated by dm at nearly all galactocentric radii .",
    "baryons are unable to account for the observed kinematics and are only a minor mass component at all galactic radii .",
    "we have used various mass modeling approaches in this work . using the nfw halo ,",
    "we find that this model fails to match the observed kinematics ( as occurs in other similar dwarfs ) .",
    "we show that non - circular motions can not resolve this discrepancy .",
    "then we modelled the galaxy by assuming the urch parametrization of the dm halo .",
    "we found that this cored distribution fits very well the observed kinematics .",
    "orion is a typical dwarf showing a cored profile of the dm density and the well - known inability of dm halo cuspy profiles to reproduce the observed kinematics . finally , we find that the mond model is discrepant with the data if we adopt the literature galaxy distance and gas mass .",
    "the kinematic data can be reproduced in the mond formalism if we allow for significant adjustments of the distance and/or value of the gas mass .",
    "let us point out that the present interferometric observations may miss some of the objects flux , although this may be limited in that the cubes do not have significant negative bowls .",
    "obviously , for bigger values of the mass , the distance at which the baryon components would well fit the data will also somewhat decrease . + it is worth stressing that there is a galaxy distance ( albeit presently not - favoured ) for which mond would strike an extraordinary success in reproducing the observed kinematics of the orion dwarf",
    ".    the orion dwarf has a favorable inclination , very regular gas kinematics , a small asymmetric drift correction , a well - understood baryonic matter distribution , and a large discrepancy between luminous and dynamical mass .",
    "all of these characteristics make this system a decisive benchmark for the mond formalism and a promising target for further detailed studies . of particular value",
    "would be a direct measurement of the distance ( for example , infrared observations with the hubble space telescope would allow a direct distance measurement via the magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch ) .",
    "the authors would like to thank the referee , gianfranco gentile , for his very fruitful comments that have increased the level of presentation of the paper ."
