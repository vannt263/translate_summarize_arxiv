    "topological defects often characterise a particular phase of a condensed matter system as they are defined by the interface between regions with different symmetries .",
    "although typically the hallmark of a phase transition , topological defects can also arise from frustration within a system .",
    "they act to mediate the frustration induced by two competing yet mutually exclusive terms in the free energy",
    ". the abrikosov phase of type ii superconductors might be the most familiar example of this .",
    "a lattice of flux vortices reconciles the meissner effect of the superconducting state with an applied magnetic field .",
    "such frustration exists in soft matter systems and frequently results in complex geometrical states of matter .",
    "the prototypical example is the chiral smectic - a@xmath0 , a phase of liquid crystals that favours equally spaced layers and inherent molecular chirality .",
    "these two conditions can not be simultaneously satisfied , resulting in frustration .",
    "frustration need not be an intrinsic property of the free energy functional .",
    "in geometric frustration , the symmetries of the local groundstate or microstructure are not a subset of the symmetries of the manifold on which the system lives . in the smectic - a@xmath0 phase , molecular chirality",
    "is incompatible with equally spaced layers .",
    "a proliferation of phases attempt to mediate between these two extremes .",
    "most notably , the twist grain boundary phase ( tgb ) , employs grain boundaries created from an infinite row of parallel screw dislocations to rotate flat layers @xcite .",
    "the helical nanofilament ( hn ) phase , like the tgb phase , originates from the intrinsic frustration between equally spaced layered smectic phase and macroscopic chirality . in systems of achiral bent - core liquid crystals and mixtures of achiral bent - core and rod - like molecules ,",
    "chiral phases often arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "macroscopic homochiral domains populate the sample , with both handednesses occurring with equal probability . unlike the b2 and b3 bent core phases , where molecular tilt with respect to the smectic layers admits chirality through the spontaneous breaking of mirror symmetry , the hn phase , a smectic a phase , allows the director to twist with respect to the layers @xcite .",
    "although initially considered to have the same morphology as the tgb , the hierarchical structure of the hn phase exhibits a distinctively different motif . upon cooling from a high temperature fluid phase , helical bundles consisting of approximately five nested smectic layers , nucleate .",
    "these homochiral , coherently rotating filaments form the basis of the hierarchical hn phase .",
    "they assemble , with axes aligned , into a hexagonal lattice producing a nanoporous bulk structure . from freeze fracture experiments on the bulk hn texture , an archetypal bouligand texture @xcite reveals an underlying cholesteric texture with the pitch direction parallel to the center of the filaments @xcite .",
    "the hn phase accommodates chirality by forming helicoidal layers that locally match a cholesteric texture at the expense of long ranged ordering of the layers .",
    "conversely , the tgb phase locally prefers flat layers , only admitting chirality across grain boundaries , thus allowing the layer normal to rotate by a fixed angle .",
    "landau - de gennes theory has proven exceedingly powerful in understanding the phase behavior of smectics , particularly the nematic to smectic - a transition ( na ) @xcite .",
    "the onset of smectic order is characterised by the development of a mass density wave locally modulating the molecular positions . in mean - field theory ,",
    "a non - zero value for the complex smectic order parameter @xmath1 indicates both the emergence of smectic order and the location of smectic layers denoted by level sets of the phase field @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the layer spacing .",
    "gauge - like minimal coupling of the nematic director field @xmath4 to the smectic order parameter , reminiscent of the landau - ginzburg theory for superconductors , penalises deviations of the director field from the layer normal @xmath5 .",
    "the low energy deformations to the nematic director field still cost energy in the smectic phase .",
    "this phenomenology is captured by the landau - de gennes free energy , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the chirality of the high temperature cholesteric phase and the three terms of the frank free energy describe the splay , twist , and bend deformations of the nematic field .",
    "further discussion shall be restricted to the london limit @xcite ( unless otherwise specified ) , where gradients in the magnitude of the smectic order may be neglected .",
    "the ratio of two natural lengthscales , @xmath8 , the twist ginzburg parameter , governs the phase behavior of chiral smectics : the twist penetration depth is the maximum length the director can deviate from the layer normal , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the compression modulus , and the coherence length @xmath11 is the distance over which @xmath12 decays to zero .",
    "type i materials ( @xmath13 ) completely expel chirality from the smectic phase . in the smectic phase @xmath14",
    ", the free energy density attains its minimal value @xmath15 corresponding to the order parameter @xmath16 and the cholesteric phase becomes favorable above the thermodynamic critical chirality @xmath17    in the case of a mixed phase , containing both smectic and cholesteric qualities , a simple treatment no longer governs the thermodynamic properties .",
    "deformations of the director field and layer spacing simultaneously contribute to the nature of the phase . restricting to regions within the smectic phase",
    ", the free energy reduces to @xmath18      the tgb phase , an intermediate phase featured in type ii materials ( @xmath19 ) admits chirality into the smectic via grain boundaries formed from an infinite row of parallel screw dislocations .",
    "each grain boundary joins two regions of smectic - a together by rotating the layer normals through an angle @xmath20 which depends on the separation between defects @xmath21 .",
    "a lattice of parallel grain boundaries separated by @xmath22 enable the smectic normals to approximately follow an underlying cholesteric texture with the average chirality @xmath23    before calculating the free energy density of the tgb phase , the natures of both the layer morphology and director field need be made manifest .",

    "a branch point singularity marks each of the screw dislocations in the grain boundary at @xmath37 and @xmath38    axis , separated by spacing @xmath21 .",
    "this rotates planar layers at @xmath39 through an angle @xmath32 at @xmath40 .",
    "( b ) the bulk tgb phase results from combining an infinite row of these grain boundaries periodically along the @xmath41axis , separated by @xmath22 .",
    "each grain boundary rotates the layer normals through angle @xmath32 , thus the grain boundaries , themselves must be rotated with respect to one another along the @xmath41axis .",
    "( c)the director field @xmath42 also rotates in accordance with the layers .",
    "it is close to constant within each grain and jumps through angle @xmath32 across each grain boundary .",

    ", it often proves more convenient to specify the behavior at the origin , for instance taking that there is a grain boundary at @xmath37 , with the axes of the screw dislocations parallel to the @xmath50axis .",

    "our united description allows us to create a complete phase diagram for the landau - de gennes energy for chiral smectics - a .",
    "we demonstrate that the hn phase is generally stable for higher values of the reduced chirality and extends below the lower critical chirality of the tgb phase and into the cholesteric phase .",
