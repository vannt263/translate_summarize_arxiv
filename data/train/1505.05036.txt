    "far - infrared ( ir ) and submillimeter ( 15  m to 1  mm ) spectroscopy provides a powerful tool to probe a wide range of environments in the universe . in the past thirty years",
    ", discoveries made by several space - based observatories have provided unique insights into physical processes leading to the evolution of the universe and its contents .",
    "this information is encoded in a variety of molecular and fine structure lines ; observations of such spectral lines enable the exploration of galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "the fine structure lines of abundant elements ( carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen ) , for example , allow tracing the obscured star formation and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity into the high - redshift universe .",
    "one can measure galaxy redshifts and determine their elemental abundances and physical conditions out to redshifts @xmath1 . in spite of this ,",
    "a number of questions remain unanswered regarding the very early steps of the universe as well as galactic , stellar , and planetary formation .",
    "the ability to explore this rich spectral region has been limited by the size and cost of the cryogenic spectrometers required to carry out these measurements .",
    "the work proposed here specifically addresses the need for integrated spectrometers and background - limited far - ir direct detectors . for space - borne astrophysics systems ,",
    "the specific requirements are shown in table  [ tab : astrophysicsneeds ] and compared against the current state of the art  @xcite .",

    "equal to zero , its analytical expression is a fourth - order periodic function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 with coefficients depending on @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "the apodization of the feed illumination limits the domain of interest to @xmath14 . in numerically exploring this function over this range",
    ", a maximum of four real roots could be identified , which repeat themselves with a periodicity of @xmath15 .",

    "the emitters positions are indicated in red and present several characteristics similar to those found and discussed in  @xcite .",
    "first , they do not lie on the grating circle but on a curve that is tilted leftwards and intersects the grating circle at the central emitter before ending up inside the multimode region .",
    "second , it was verified that the shape of this curve only approximates a circle with a radius @xmath16 and is not symmetric . in the case",
    "presented here , this is caused by the absence of constraints on all stigmatic points . in general , for a two - stigmatic - point configuration the emitters lie exactly on the grating circle , as previously reported in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the imposition of zero rms phase error on a third stigmatic point ( the blaze point ) also caused a similar tilting effect  @xcite , unless the emitters could be constrained to lie within a small distance ( e.g. , @xmath17 ) from the @xmath18 circle  @xcite .     and",

    "[ fig : rms phase error ] .",
    "its values remain below 0.1  rad over an angular range spanning approximately from 16@xmath20 to 176@xmath20 .",
    "this phase error does not lead to a significant defocus of the light in the spectrometer  @xcite and represents a @xmath21 improvement in the focal plane utilization over the previous designs  @xcite .",
    "four stigmatic points are visible , but they are no longer associated with a predefined frequency , given the absence of constraints on them .",
    "[ fig : rms phase error ] it can be seen to what frequencies they correspond in this design .",
    "the nominal spectral range indicated in table  [ tab : optimalpar ] is only partially covered down to @xmath22 510  ghz at 0@xmath20 , while above 130@xmath20 frequencies higher than 650  ghz show up , where the dispersion in the superconducting niobium s reactance is no longer negligible  @xcite",
    ". a slightly larger multimode region could be employed to reduce these tensions .",
    ", and four stigmatic points can be seen over a 160@xmath20 angular range.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]      the power coupling efficiency in the new design configuration was computed with the model described in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4 ) .",
    "the ratio of the power emitted by the feed horns to the power received by the antennas is approximately equal to unity .",
    "this high efficiency is the result of the absence of any higher - order diffraction peaks in the multimode region due to the relative emitter diameter , @xmath23 , being smaller than 1/2  @xcite .",
    "the detailed coupling efficiency of the receiver feeds was not treated . for simplicity ,",
    "the individual feed structures were mathematically modeled as if the focal surface were subdivided into apertures of equal size .",
    "the current configuration outperforms our previous first - order designs  @xcite in terms of efficiency , while simultaneously providing the desired resolving power .",
    "a design methodology was developed for high - resolution configurations of the @xmath0-spec multimode region .",
    "the design procedure first maximizes the resolving power subject to constraints on geometry , operating frequency range , and performance , thereby determining the order of the spectrometer .",
    "this then allows the rms phase error on the instrument focal plane to be minimized .",
    "this work discussed a particular design achieved without constraining the rms phase error to vanish at preselected points on the focal plane .",
    "this led to a configuration with four stigmatic points on the focal plane , a feature which can be used to increase the number of spectrometer channels as the phase error is reduced over a larger angular and spectral bandwidth .",
    "the design achieves a maximum rms phase error equal to 0.1 rad , near - unity coupling , and a resolution of 257 in first order .",
    "future work will be aimed at employing this design methodology to generate higher - resolution @xmath24 configurations .",
