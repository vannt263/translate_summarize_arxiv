    "understanding how the jets from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are launched is an outstanding question in astrophysics .",
    "blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) proposed an electro - magnetic model by which the energy of the black hole could launch a relativistic jet .",
    "magnetic fields play an important role in this and many of the proposed models and simulations ( e.g. , meier , koide & uchida 2001 , meier 2005 ) . a predicted consequence of strong , ordered magnetic fields that wrap around the jet is a gradient in the faraday rotation measure ( rm ) transverse to the long axis of the jet ( blandford 1993 ) .",
    "asada et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and zavala & taylor ( 2005 ) , found evidence for rm gradients in 3c273 , and this was quickly followed with claims for rm gradients in 0745 + 241 , 0820 + 225 , mrk501 , and 3c371 by gabuzda et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and in da237 and 1156 + 295 , 1749 + 096 by gabuzda et al .",
    "recently , contopoulos et al . (",
    "2009 ) claim that rm gradients have been established in 36 instances in 29 sources and further suggest that the sense of rm gradients has a preferred direction .",
    "they claim that the preponderance of clockwise gradients ( 22 ) over counterclockwise ( 14 ) gradients is the result of an invariant twist of the magnetic fields in agn jets .",
    "note , however that knigl ( 2010 ) shows that , if such a preference exists , it can be explained in terms of standard models .",
    "considering the observational results one is left with the impression that transverse rm gradients on parsec scales are the rule rather than the exception .",
    "the best established ( spatially resolved ) case is still that in 3c273 , which is an exceptionally nearby quasar , and one of the brightest radio sources in the sky at centimeter wavelengths . with the exception of 3c273 , many of the transverse rm gradients claimed in the literature are in sources where the synthesized beam spans not much more than the width of the jet ( e.g. , gabuzda et al .",
    "increasing the angular resolution by going to shorter wavelengths is seldom rewarding , as the jets are steep spectrum so at shorter wavelengths one tends to probe only the brightest part of the jet base .",
    "observers thus run the risk of extrapolating results from a nearby , well - resolved object onto a less well - resolved population .",
    "a further difficulty is that the observations require a broad coverage in wavelength - squared space , obtained simultaneously , with matching resolution .",
    "this wavelength coverage is not always achieved in vlbi polarization observations .",
    "the considerable body of observational literature describing rm features on parsec scales begs for support from simulations .",
    "given a relativistic jet pointed close to the line - of - sight with a dominantly toroidal magnetic field component that extends into a faraday rotating plasma , what should observers see ? broderick & mckinney ( 2010 ) have recently completed such an effort .",
    "their results show that jets that are not well resolved will not produce simple transverse rm gradients .",
    "broderick & mckinney also verify the observational intuition that spectral index effects will significantly complicate the interpretation of rm gradients in optically thick regions .",
    "they also provide a physical connection between the black hole and the rm via the accretion rate .",
    "we examine transverse rm gradients in relativistic jets which maximize the spatial resolution at our disposal by selecting a sample of 4 strong , broad jets from the mojave sample ( lister et al .",
    "2009 ) known to be well polarized at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "we then carried out sensitive multi - band vlbi polarimetry on them .",
    "we present these observations and note the presence or absence of transverse rm gradients .",
    "we conclude with a set of objective observational criteria for determining if a transverse rm gradient exists .",
    "we assume @xmath0 = 71 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 and a @xmath2cdm cosmology with @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( e.g. eisenstein et al . 2005 ; hinshaw et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out at 8 , 13 , and 15 ghz on 2003 september 26 using all ten elements of the vlba of the nrao .",
    "each source was observed in @xmath512 scans of 2 - 3 minutes each at each frequency band .",
    "amplitude calibration for each antenna was derived from measurements of antenna gain and system temperatures during each run .",
    "delays between the stations clocks were determined using the aips task fring ( schwab & cotton 1983 ) .",
    "calibration was applied by splitting the multi - source data set immediately prior to preliminary editing , imaging ( using natural weighting ) , deconvolution ( using the clean algorithm ) and self - calibration in difmap ( shepherd , pearson , & taylor 1995 ) .",
    "the preliminary models developed in difmap were subsequently applied in aips to make phase corrections , to determine the leakage terms between the rcp and lcp feeds and to correct for residual phase differences between polarizations .",
    "total intensity images were made using all available ifs near 8 , 13 or 15 ghz bands , while stokes q and u images were constructed at 8.114 , 8.209 , 8.369 , 8.594 , 12.915 , 13.885 , 14.915 , and 15.391 ghz with 8 mhz bandwidths .",
    "further subdivision of the frequencies within the 8 mhz bandwidths was deemed unnecessary given the maximum rms observed .",
    "absolute calibration of the polarization angle was accomplished by observations of 3c279 , 1751 + 096 , and bl lac , which are observed regularly by the vla polarization monitoring program to provide calibration information for vlba users .",
    "rotation measure ( rm ) maps were then formed from matched resolution polarization angle images at these 8 frequencies .",
    "resolutions were matched by applying the appropriate taper in the @xmath6 plane when imaging and then restoring with a common beam size .",
    "pixels in the rm images were blanked if the error in any polarization angle image exceeded 20 degrees , or if the total intensity was less than 6 times the rms noise level .",
    "no correction for redshift has been made so the intrinsic rotation measures in the rest - frame of the source are larger than the observed values by @xmath7 .",
    "for each source we examined the rm image and took slices across the jet . outside of the core region , the rms are well fit by a @xmath8-law fit , and have constant fractional polarization , which taken together indicates that their origin is most likely in an external faraday screen , and not due to thermal material intermixed with the radiating plasma ( burn 1966 ) . in the core region some large deviations from a @xmath8-law may be present due to unresolved substructures . for one source ( 3c371 ) rms could only be determined at the base of the jet where the jet is only marginally resolved . for the other three sources we were able to resolve the jet and we present the rm images obtained .",
    "this source is a flat spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) with a redshift of z=1.401 ( burbidge 1970 ) .",
    "it emits powerfully across the electromagnetic spectrum and is detected in the gamma - rays by egret ( hartman et al .",

    "2009 ) with apparent velocities between 9 and 15 c. a compact , flat spectrum core is identified with a steep spectrum jet extending to the south .",
    "this jet is exceptionally broad , with an opening angle of @xmath560 .",
    "piner & kingham ( 1997 ) estimate the orientation of the jet at @xmath127  to the line - of - sight .    in fig",
    ".  1 we show the rm image for j1613 + 3412 with an inset slice across the jet at its broadest point .",
    "the jet is @xmath56 mas wide or about 5 beams across , so well resolved .",
    "we find a spearman correlation coefficient of @xmath130.2 , and a reduced @xmath14 for a linear fit of 2.8 which reject a linear gradient across the jet .",
    "there is a sharp change in the rm along the jet from relatively high values in the core of @xmath13600 2  decreasing to an average of 0 2  in the outer part of the jet ( spearman correlation @xmath130.83 ) .",
    "this behavior is typical for blazars which have much higher rms in their central regions , presumably because of the increase in density near the bottom of the gravitational potential of the supermassive black - hole ( zavala & taylor 2002 , 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "the rm image from zavala & taylor ( 2003 ) is quite similar though it does nt cover as much of the jet .",

    "there are large and abrupt changes in the rm , however we caution against interpreting this as an rm gradient since substructure in the core is likely .",

    "the rms in the core are low ( @xmath1370 @xmath15 10 2 ) which is a bit unusual for agn , but we could just be catching bl lac in a low state .",
    "zavala & taylor ( 2003 ) found an rm of @xmath20 2 , and before that reynolds , cawthorne & gabuzda ( 2001 ) found a core rm of @xmath13550 2 .",
    "contopoulos et al . ( 2009 ) claim to have found 29 agns from the literature that have rm gradients transverse to the jet direction that are monotonic and `` extend across all or nearly all of the jet '' .",

    "do nt present any statistics on how well fit the gradients are by a straight line .",
    "this list includes both mrk 501 and 3c371 studied here .",

    "( 2004 ) use three frequencies which is essentially the minimum with which to claim a rotation measure determination and the observations ( with the possible exception of mrk 501 ) do not significantly resolve the region in which the rm is detected .",

    "contopolous et al . (",
    "2009 ) also claim the presence of rm gradients in b0212 + 735 , and b1803 + 784 based on the observations of zavala & taylor ( 2003 ) . in both of these instances the jets were not resolved and it appears that spurious values at edge pixels ( a common problem in determinations of rms in regions of low signal - to - noise ) were over - interpreted to indicate the presence of a gradient .",
    "contopoulos et al",
    ". list 7/29 sources with rm gradients at a distance of 0 mas and thus coincident with the vlbi core .",
    "as the simulations of broderick & mckinney ( 2010 ) show this is a problematic area for rm measurements .",
    "high spatial resolution polarimetry observations reveal the complex nature of these regions and further justify caution in claiming detection of rm gradients at the `` core '' of agn ( zavala & taylor 2001 ; denn , mutel & marscher 2000 ) .",
    "if one only has two measurements then a gradient will exist anytime these values differ .",
    "we suggest that to establish an rm gradient requires that the following two observational and two physical constraints are met :    * at least three resolution elements across the jet .",
    "* a change in the rm by at least three times the typical error . * an optically thin synchrotron spectrum at the location of the gradient .",
    "* a monotonically smooth ( within the errors ) change in the rm from side to side .",
    "to date the above criteria have been met ( to our knowledge ) only for 3c273 . in this work",
    "we attempt to improve our observational footing by applying these criteria to four additional sources .",
    "while 3c371 fails on the first ( observational ) test , the other three sources pass the first two observational criteria , and the third physical criterion of an optically thin jet , but fail on the critical fourth physical criterion .",
    "that is , these three sources have data of sufficient quality that they could reveal an rm gradient , but no smooth monotonic gradient across the jet is found .",
    "however , even if simple monotonic gradients across agn jets turn out to be rare , it is still important to make careful comparison of the observed rm profiles with simulations . for example , the inset slice in our fig",
    ".  1 bears some resemblance to fig .",
    "5a of broderick & mckinney ( 2010 ) . in their simulation",
    "the jet is oriented at 10 degrees to the line of sight which is very close to the estimate of 7 degrees ( piner & kingham 1997 ) .",
    "it is worth noting in passing that all of the sources studied here are detected in @xmath19-rays .",
    "this is also true for 3c273 .",
    "this may be the result of the selection criteria of broad jets , together with the fact that sources with broad jets tend to be preferentially detected at high energies ( taylor et al .",
    "2007 , linford et al . 2010 ) .",
    "based on well - resolved rotation measure imaging of three agn we find that none of them exhibit a monotonic linear gradient in the rm across the jet .",
    "examination of claims for rm gradients in the literature ( including two of the four sources we observed ) are found to be based on observations that generally have not resolved the jet , include components with large opacities , or suffer from spurious edge effects .",
    "we offer a set of criteria that can be used to reliably determine if an rm gradient exists . moreover , even if simple linear gradients across agn jets turn out to be rare , it will be important to make careful comparison of the observed rm profiles with simulations ( e.g. , broderick & mckinney 2010 ) .",
    "future observations with higher resolution , such as will be afforded by vsop-2 , will be crucial in order to increase the number of parsec - scale jets that are well resolved across the jet .",
    "new wideband correlators will allow for rm synthesis ( brentjens & de bruyn 2005 ) observations with increased precision and the ability to disentangle multiple rm screens .",
    "another possibility , assuming improvements in the sensitivity of vlbi arrays , is the detection of polarization in two - sided jet sources such as ngc 1052 ( vermuelen et al .",
    "2003 ) or 3c84 ( taylor et al .  2006 ) .",
    "polarized counter - jets may reveal rm gradients consistent with a dominant toroidal field ( blandford 1993 ) .",
