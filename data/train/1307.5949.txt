    "using the generalized entropy instead of the bekenstein entropy will provide new insight into entropic cosmology .",

    "<S> unlike the bekenstein entropy , which is proportional to area , the generalized entropy is proportional to volume because of appropriate nonadditive generalizations . </S>",
    "<S> the entropic - force term derived from the generalized entropy is found to behave as if it were an extra driving term for bulk viscous cosmology , in which a bulk viscosity of cosmological fluids is assumed . using an effective description similar to bulk viscous cosmology , we formulate the modified friedmann , acceleration , and continuity equations for entropic cosmology . based on this formulation , we propose two entropic - force models derived from the bekenstein and generalized entropies . in order to examine the properties of the two models </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a homogeneous , isotropic , and spatially flat universe , focusing on a single - fluid - dominated universe . </S>",
    "<S> the two entropic - force models agree well with the observed supernova data . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the entropic - force model derived from the generalized entropy predicts a decelerating and accelerating universe , as for a fine - tuned standard @xmath0cdm ( lambda cold dark matter ) model , whereas the entropic - force model derived from the bekenstein entropy predicts a uniformly accelerating universe . </S>"
