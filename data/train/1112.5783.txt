    "strongly correlated systems have many competing energy scales driving system into a variety of phases . at zero temperature",
    "two different phases are separated by a quantum critical point , where the quantum fluctuations become strong leading to a quantum phases transition ( qpt),@xcite where a macroscopic change occurs in the system .",
    "the role of correlations , either classical or quantum , between underlying degrees of freedom is the key to understanding qpt . the latter is called _ entanglement _ , which is a measure of nonlocal correlations of quantum manybody states .",
    "entanglement is a versatile quantity intensively studied in quantum information theory and strongly correlated systems providing an exchange of ideas between two apparently distinct fields .",
    "indeed , the entanglement has been recognized as an essential resource in quantum computation and communication @xcite .",
    "entanglement based ideas lead to distinguish criticality from off - criticality in 1d @xcite , area law scaling of entanglement entropy @xcite and topological sub - leading term @xcite .",
    "kondo lattice model @xcite is one of the promising models in the study of strongly correlated heavy fermion compounds @xcite , where the partially filled shells ( _ f _ ) are screened by outer shells ( _ s _ or _ p _ ) .",
    "inner shells are localized and can be effectively characterized by magnetic impurities located in the electron gas of outer shells . in the presence of strong interaction between the magnetic impurities and electron gas , a more simplified version of kondo lattice , namely kondo - necklace ( kn ) model @xcite arises ( see sec .  [ pcut_kn ] ) .",
    "the phases of the kondo - necklace model in spatial dimensions d=1,2,3 have been studied by different methods .",
    "while numerical monte carlo @xcite and density matrix renormalization group @xcite ( dmrg ) results confirm the absence of qpt in 1d , a phase transition between antiferromagnetic ( af ) and kondo singlet phases occurs in higher dimensions .    in this work",
    "we study qpt of the anisotropic kondo - necklace model in spatial dimensions @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 by employing perturbative continuous unitary transformations ( pcut ) @xcite . as the extreme limit of the spin liquid phase of the model",
    "is characterized as isolated dimers , the model is well suited through the above method , then the inter - site interaction is treated perturbatively .",
    "moreover , the system is studied at the thermodynamic limit .",
    "other merits of the method are as follows . at the first glance , with implementing pcut on the contrary of some numerical methods , we can obtain _ energy of states",
    "analytically as a function of hamiltonian parameters_. it helps us to find some other underlying phase transition witnesses such as concurrence ( from correlation functions that they themselves can be calculated from derivatives of ground state energy correspond to hamiltonian parameters at zero temperature ) .",
    "in addition , in this method we do nt need knowing eigenstates of the system for finding ground and excited states energies and we can calculate energies independent of finding systems eigenstates ( in some numerical methods such as quantum monte carlo we should guess a prime trial state ) .",
    "last , in this method , we do nt have any size and dimension restrictions that put lots of obstacles in front of some other numerical methods .",
    "we can use this method for arbitrary dimensions and system sizes .",
    "we further characterize the qpt by using  concurrence \" @xcite as a measure of entanglement between a pair of spin-@xmath4 particles .",
    "we will use entanglement of the ground state in order to characterize the phase transition .",
    "the entanglement properties of the one dimensional kondo - necklace model with a few sites in order to have analytical results has already been addressed @xcite . in the current work",
    "we will take the thermodynamic limit via pcut and probe the phase transitions in spatial dimensions @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 . despite its local nature ,",
    "nonanalytic behavior of derivatives of concurrence signals a phase transition in the system , and its scaling in the vicinity of critical points is connected to the universality class of the model @xcite .",
    "we will show that the critical points detected by such nonanalyticities are not only in well agreement with the gap closing points but with mean - field theory @xcite and green function @xcite results .",
    "moreover , we discuss the crossover from the non - critical one - dimensional model to the critical two dimensional one investigating the properties of the model on the ladder geometry .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ pcut ] the pcut method is briefly reviewed .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ pcut_kn ] the explicit expression for ground state energy and excitation spectrum of the kondo - necklace model are derived by pcut method , and the qpt of the model is discussed in sec .",
    "[ qpt ] . finally , we present the summary and discussion of our results .",
    "there are few examples in strongly - correlated systems where one can find exact solutions , i.e. , exact ground state and excitation spectrum in addition to some correlation functions . however , numerical methods give an approximation for the physical properties of these systems .",
    "one of these methods , which can diagonalize a hamiltonian properly , regardless of system size , is the continuous unitary transformation .",
    "this method had been introduced simultaneously in refs .   for condensed matter systems and quantum chromodynamic problems .",
    "in this approach the hamiltonian is considered as a function of a flow parameter ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian is transformed to a simpler form ( diagonal or band - block diagonal ) under a flow equation which is based on applying infinite numbers of infinitesimal unitary transformation .",
    "let us define the hamiltonian , @xmath6 , as a function of a continuous parameter @xmath5 where @xmath7 is the bare hamiltonian and @xmath8 is the final diagonalized effective one .",
    "the evolution of the hamiltonian in terms of the continuous unitary transformation is given by the following sets of equations @xmath9,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the unitary transformation and the anti - hermitian operator @xmath11 is the generator of this transformation .",
    "there are several choices for @xmath12 which depends on the hamiltonian and the possibility to find a closed form for the transformation .",
    "for instance , wegner considered @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the diagonal part of hamiltonian in a specified base ket and @xmath15 is the corresponding off - diagonal part .",
    "accordingly , the generator is defined by @xmath16.\\ ] ] however , it does not lead to an analytic solution for @xmath17 , as a general case .",
    "moreover , the wegner choice mixes the blocks of hamiltonian during transformation if the original hamiltonian is block diagonal . to overcome this problem mielke @xcite proposed a generator to preserve the band diagonal form of the initial hamiltonian and accordingly knetter and uhrig introduced the perturbative continuous unitary transformation ( pcut ) @xcite . in this approach",
    "the original hamiltonian is decomposed to two parts @xmath18 , where the unperturbed hamiltonian is @xmath19 and @xmath20 represents the off - diagonal part at @xmath21 which is considered as a perturbation for @xmath22 . then",
    ", the generator of transformation is obtained order by order in terms of perturbation parameter @xmath23 . moreover",
    ", the off - diagonal part evolves to reach the @xmath24 effective hamiltonian .",
    "however , pcut has two prerequisites :    1 .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian ( @xmath22 ) has to be composed of equidistant energy levels which are bounded from below .",
    "2 .   the perturbing hamiltonian ( @xmath25 ) should be written as @xmath26 for finite value of @xmath27 , where @xmath28 increases or decreases the energy quanta of the specified levels defined by @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath29=nt_n$ ] .",
    "we follow the formalism defined by uhrig and knetter , in which the generator of transformation is defined by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the order of perturbation , @xmath32 are real valued functions which are obtained by recursive differential equations @xcite and @xmath33 denotes a sequence of quanta labels @xmath34 moreover , @xmath35 means the summation is done on all possible configurations of a sequence with @xmath31 members . in the above equation , @xmath36 is the total number of energy quanta which is created or annihilated by @xmath37 . in this respect ,",
    "the hamiltonian is given in the following form @xmath38    in order to get a final diagonalized hamiltonian , the number of energy quanta which is created or annihilated at @xmath24 must be zero .",
    "therefore , we can write the effective hamiltonian as @xmath39 where @xmath40 . the solution of the flow equation for the generator given by eq .   and the hamiltonian defined in eq",
    ".   leads to the coefficients @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the effective hamiltonian is obtained perturbatively as a sum of different orders of perturbation .",
    "one dimensional kondo - necklace model .",
    "solid and grey circles stand for spins of itinerant and localized electrons .",
    ", width=302 ]    the anisotropic kondo - necklace model on a hypercubic lattice is defined by the following hamiltonian , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the spin of itinerant electrons on the @xmath44-dimensional hypercubic lattice with @xmath45 sites , @xmath46 is the spin of localized electrons connected to each lattice point and @xmath47 represents the nearest neighbor sites on the lattice .",
    "and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are , respectively , the local exchange coupling and anisotropy parameter . here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the exchange and anisotropy couplings on the lattice , respectively . the one - dimensional lattice is shown in fig .",
    "[ kn - chain ] and a generalization to two and three dimensional system can be deduced from this figure .",
    "we have considered the fully anisotropic case , which enables us to study the anisotropy effects as well to obtain the correlation functions via introducing a generating function . for simplicity , we define @xmath52 and set @xmath53 . to apply pcut we consider the following decomposition of hamiltonian @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "the anisotropic part of local interactions are considered in the perturbing part ( @xmath20 ) in order to have an equidistant spectrum for @xmath56 which satisfies the first criterion for pcut approach .",
    "the ground state of @xmath57 is a kondo - singlet state for @xmath58 which justifies @xmath59 to be small .",
    "in other words , we trace the quantum phase transition from the kondo - singlet phase where @xmath23 is a small parameter .",
    "the kondo - singlet state is the ground state of the unperturbed hamiltonian ( @xmath56 ) which is a product of singlets on local dimers ( @xmath43-@xmath46 pair ) .",
    "moreover , the spectrum of a local dimer is composed of a singlet and triplet state representing two quanta , 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "thus the effect of @xmath20 on two neighboring singlets changes the quanta by @xmath60 with @xmath61 which provides the same coefficients ( @xmath41 ) derived in ref .   for our calculations .",
    "to find @xmath63 we need to calculate the @xmath37 operators which essentially define the effect of @xmath20 on a base ket .",
    "as far as the hamiltonian is composed of two body interactions the effect of @xmath20 can be represented by its effect on two neighboring dimers , i.e. , [ hs ] h_s=_i , j h^i , j_s a dimer is a pair of @xmath43 spin and its corresponding neighboring impurity spin @xmath46 which can be in a singlet or triplet state configurations .",
    "accordingly , the effect of @xmath64 on two neighboring dimers ( @xmath65 ) may change the quanta of the state by @xmath66 which is represented by @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the pair hamiltonian of @xmath20 is written in the following form : @xmath68 two neighboring dimers are represented by @xmath69 configurations depending on the configuration of each dimer to be in a singlet or triplet state .",
    "we have summarized the effect of all @xmath67 operators on all possible 16 states of two neighboring dimers in table [ jadv ] of appendix [ aa ] .",
    "the translational symmetry of the hamiltonian allows us to use table [ jadv ] for any pair of neighboring dimers . according to eq .",
    "the perturbing hamiltonian , @xmath20 is written in terms of a sum on @xmath67 operators .",
    "for instance , in the one - dimensional model which has @xmath70 dimers with periodic boundary condition we arrive at @xmath71 in the above equation , @xmath28 is the sum of @xmath67 operators on all bonds which connects two neighboring dimers on the lattice .",
