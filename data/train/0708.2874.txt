    "while measurements of branching ratios for kaon decay modes such as @xmath7 have shown good agreement  @xcite with chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) calculations to order @xmath4 , chpt calculation to order @xmath5 have been difficult to check due to the presence of the large lower order terms .",
    "since the @xmath8 mode is forbidden to order @xmath4 in chpt  @xcite , this mode presents an opportunity to check chpt at higher orders .",
    "therefore an experimental measurement of this mode s branching ratio is of interest . at present , a chiral dimensional analysis  @xcite for the @xmath8 mode results in a branching ratio of @xmath9 .",
    "because of the bose statistics of the @xmath10 pair and the presence of a real direct emission @xmath11 , the @xmath0 decay proceeds at lowest order via the cp conserving direct emission of a electric quadrupole ( e2 ) photon .",
    "this causes a large suppression of this mode relative to the associated @xmath12 mode .",
    "accordingly , observation of @xmath8 would give a measurement of e2 quadrupole emission which is difficult to extract from the e1 and m1 dominated @xmath12 mode . the m1 amplitude determined from @xmath12 decay together with a plausible estimate for the e2 amplitude  @xcite , given by @xmath13",
    "can be used to obtain an estimate of the branching ratio for @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the momenta of the pions and k and @xmath16 are the momentum and polarization of the photon respectively .",
    "@xmath17 is the coupling of the e2 amplitude .",
    "@xmath18 , a mass parameter that measures the extent of the region over which the interaction takes place , is assumed to be of order of the @xmath19 meson mass .",
    "the cp violating direct emission of a m2 magnetic quadrupole photon is much smaller than the e2 transition and can be ignored . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the decay rate for @xmath0 can be estimated by comparing it to the m1 direct emission ( de ) amplitude of the @xmath12 decay @xmath20 employing this amplitude , the ratio @xmath21 can be formed . using the fraction of @xmath22 to @xmath23 due to m1 direct emission of @xmath24 from ref .",
    "@xcite and a @xmath25 branching ratio of @xmath26 from the pdg  @xcite , a branching ratio for m1 de part of the @xmath12 decay of @xmath27 ( @xmath28mev ) is obtained .",
    "using eq . 3 above , this gives an estimated branching ratio of @xmath29 for @xmath8 ( under the assumption that @xmath17 has similar magnitude to @xmath30 ) .",
    "the ktev collaboration previously reported an upper limit of of @xmath31 ( 90% cl )  @xcite for the related decay @xmath32 in which the direct emission e2 photon was virtual .",
    "however , we point out that this decay , in contrast to the @xmath0 decay where the photon is real , can proceed via an additional process forbidden for a real photon .",
    "the virtual photon is emitted in a j=0 state from the @xmath33 allowing a transition of the @xmath33 to a @xmath34 followed by the cp allowed decay @xmath35 .",
    "this is the so - called charge radius amplitude  @xcite .",
    "the rates for these two decays would have similar branching ratios except for the the charge radius amplitude .",
    "the previous best upper limit of @xmath36 ( 90% cl ) for the @xmath0 decay obtained by the na31 experiment  @xcite was achieved by searching for this mode in events with five photons in the final state . due to the particular configuration of triggers and prescale factors in the ktev experiment ,",
    "the most sensitive method was to require that one of the neutral pions undergo dalitz decay @xmath37 .",
    "the search for the @xmath38 mode was performed using the 1997 and 1999 runs of ktev e799 ii at fermi national accelerator laboratory .",
    "the ktev e799 experiment used two almost parallel @xmath33 beam lines generated by interactions of 800 gev / c protons in a beo target some 90 meters upstream of the ktev spectrometer .",
    "the ktev spectrometer consisted of a 70 meter evacuated decay tube followed by , in sequence , two stations of drift chambers , a large aperture dipole magnet , two more stations of drift chambers , a multi - plane transition radiation detector , a 3100 element csi electromagnetic calorimeter and a muon detector .",
    "the 1997 and 1999 runs differed in the following ways .",
    "the spill length was doubled from 20 in the 1997 run to 40 seconds in the 1999 run . the proton intensity on the beo neutral kaon production target",
    "was increased from @xmath39 in the 1997 run to @xmath40 per spill in the 1999 run .",
    "another important difference between the 1997 and 1999 run was that the magnetic field was decreased from a transverse deflection of 205 mev / c in 1997 to 150 mev / c in 1999 to increase acceptance for some of the neutral kaon modes .",
    "the trigger which demanded two charged tracks and at least four electromagnetic clusters was loosened midway during the 1997 run by changing the minimum thresholds for energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter and remained loose for the 1999 run .",
    "the @xmath41 final state consists of four photons plus an @xmath42 pair .",
    "the ktev analysis required six electromagnetic showers ( @xmath43 0.6 gev ) in the csi calorimeter , two of which were associated with two reconstructed charged tracks .",
    "the two charged tracks were required to be consistent with the two track trigger , form a good charged track vertex , have opposite charge , and have @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 is the energy of the associated shower in the csi calorimeter and @xmath46 is the momentum determined from magnetic bending ) .",
    "events passing these cuts were required to satisfy several additional cuts to select @xmath0 and to reject the major background due to @xmath47 decays .",
    "these events can contribute to the background if one of the photons was not detected or two of the photons reconstructed as single photon .",
    "additional cuts were performed including a vertex cut determined by cycling over all @xmath48 and @xmath49 combinations in a given event for all possible vertex positions to determine the vertex where the @xmath50 and @xmath51 were closest to the @xmath3 mass .",
    "the vertex thus obtained was required to be between 95 and 150 meters from the beo target in the ktev decay volume and to have a good vertex @xmath52 .",
    "another cut was made on the variable ( @xmath53 defined as the longitudinal momentum squared of the @xmath3 in the frame in which the momentum of the @xmath54 pair is totally transverse . if the event is a @xmath47 decay , ( @xmath53 is greater than zero . if the event is a @xmath38 decay , ( @xmath53 is less than zero ( modulo resolution ) . accordingly ( @xmath53 was required @xmath55 gev@xmath56/c@xmath56 in order to select @xmath41 decays and reject @xmath47 .",
    "the analysis cuts were varied slightly between the 1997 and 1999 run .",
    "the main changes were to alter the shape of the @xmath57 and @xmath58 signal region and to tighten the decay vertex position and the overlapping shower cuts to reject more background .",
    "monte carlos were developed for the signal @xmath38 mode incorporating the model of ref .",
    "@xcite as well as for the various backgrounds , and the normalization mode incorporating all known features of the e799 spectrometer and beam .",
    "the various @xmath33 modes were generated using experimentally determined decay parameters .",
    "trigger and analysis cuts applied to the monte carlos were the same as those applied to the data .",
    "background and normalization mode monte carlos were generated to produce monte carlo samples several times the 1997 and 1999 run @xmath33 fluxes .    as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1.25 ] , a comparisons of a @xmath38 and a background monte carlo @xmath59 with the 1997 data shows that the angle @xmath60 between the direct emission photon and one of the two @xmath3 s in the @xmath10 center of mass is peaked for the signal mode at cos@xmath61 and flat for @xmath47 .",

    "several other decays were investigated to see if there was any contribution to background after the cuts to select @xmath38 .",
    "these modes included @xmath64 where a dalitz pair is undetected , @xmath65 followed by the decay of a @xmath3 into an @xmath42 pair , @xmath65 followed by the decay of a @xmath3 into @xmath66 with one of the @xmath42 pairs undetected , @xmath67 decays with accidental photons , and @xmath68 plus accidental photons . in no case",
    "did any of these modes contribute significantly to the background .",

    "the signal region was chosen to be rectangular with 0.494 gev / c@xmath70 m @xmath71 0.501 gev / c@xmath56 and @xmath72 0.00015 ( gev / c)@xmath56 . in the later analysis of the 1999 data",
    ", it was decided to use a contour containing 68% of the signal monte carlo events as determined from a joint probability distribution based on the signal monte carlo resolutions for @xmath57 and @xmath58 . since the signal box had already been opened for the 1997 data ( and no events",
    "were observed as discussed below ) , the rectangular signal region was kept for the 97 data .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]a , no events were observed in the 1997 data in this region when the box was opened after the blind analysis was completed . from the @xmath47 background monte carlo , we expected @xmath73 background events in the 1997 run .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2]b , one data event was found in the 1999 signal region while the background @xmath47 monte carlo yielded no events in the signal region for four equivalent @xmath33 fluxes .",
    "these monte carlo background estimates for the 1997 and 1999 runs are consistent with the background estimates based on mass and @xmath69 sideband projection from the data .     vs. @xmath57 for the 1997 ktev data ;",

    "since the @xmath47 branching ratio is well measured and since events where a photon was lost down the beam hole had the same topology as the signal and were copious , these events were used for the normalization for the experiment .",
    "the reason for selecting this topology was to minimize the systematics due to trigger and event configuration between the signal and normalization modes .",
    "the criteria to select these normalization mode events included the same topology criteria , the vertex position cut , and the @xmath3 mass cuts as the signal mode .",
    "cuts that were special to the selection of the normalization mode included a requirement that @xmath74 .",
    "in addition , to insure that the event was consistent with a @xmath47 decay with a photon going down the beam hole , the missing photon was reconstructed by assuming a kaon mass and net zero @xmath75 for the event .",
    "this resulted in two solutions for energy and trajectory of the missing photon . if one of the solutions for the missing photon combined with the unpaired photon in the observed event to form a @xmath3 mass within 0.05 gev / c@xmath56 , if the other three photons and the @xmath42 in the event paired to form @xmath3 s , and if the missing photon s calculated trajectory pointed to either beam hole , the event was included in the normalization sample .",
    "normalization mode yields of 7725 and 9024 @xmath47 were obtained for the 1997 and 1999 data using these criteria .",
    "we can avoid the extra error due to the branching ratio uncertainty in the dalitz decay by noting that the @xmath76 single event sensitivities ( _ ses _ ) are given by @xmath77 where a@xmath78 are the acceptances for the @xmath41 dalitz decay mode and n@xmath79 are the @xmath33 fluxes for the 1997 and 1999 modes .",
    "the fluxes are @xmath80 so the _ ses _",
    "s for @xmath81 are given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the number and the acceptance of normalization mode @xmath47 events in the 97 and 99 runs .",
    "the factor of 2 and 3 arise from the number of @xmath3 s that can produce a dalitz pair in the signal and normalization modes .",
    "note that the dalitz decay branching ratio cancels out in the _ ses _ for @xmath8 .    from the @xmath41 and @xmath47 monte carlos",
    ", the signal and normalization acceptances were determined to be 0.101% and @xmath85 for the 1997 run and 0.085% and @xmath86 for the 1999 runs respectively .",
    "6 and the measured 19.56@xmath870.12% branching ratio for @xmath65  @xcite , the 1997 and 1999 _ ses _ s were determined to be @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively .",
    "in addition , @xmath33 fluxes of 2.68@xmath90 and 3.99@xmath90 were obtained for the 1997 and 1999 runs .",
    "the _ ses _ s for 97/99 were combined using @xmath91 resulting in a combined @xmath92 of @xmath93 .",
    "systematic errors for the upper limit could arise from several sources . among them was the error in the branching ratio for @xmath65 .",
    "there were also disagreements between the distributions of the @xmath47 normalization mode data and monte carlo .",
    "the effect of these disagreements on the _ ses _ were studied by adjusting the monte carlos to eliminate the disagreements and seeing what changes in the _ ses _ took place .",
    "there could also be disagreements between the @xmath38 data and its monte carlo .",
    "a disagreement in signal mode data and monte carlo could not be checked directly since no signal is observed . however , from an inspection of the calculation of the _ ses _ , it can be seen that the _ ses _ is proportional to @xmath94 .",
    "so , to the level that the normalization and signal mode topologies are similar , it was expected that differences in acceptance between the monte carlo and the data would tend to cancel .",
    "studies were done of the effect of disagreements between the signal mode and normalization mode monte carlos by adjusting the monte carlos until they agreed and determining the effect on the result .",
    ".systematic uncertainties for @xmath8 _ ses _ [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     the percentage systematic errors in the _ ses _ due to these sources are shown in table  [ systematics ] . adding these systematic errors in table i in quadrature",
    ", we obtain a total systematic error in the _ ses _ of 7.23% .",
    "taking into account the statistical error of 1.09% , this leads to a total error of 7.31% resulting in a _",

    "a confidence region was constructed containing 90% of the poisson distribution by varying the @xmath8 branching ratio between 0 to @xmath101 . using this confidence region ,",
    "a 90% cl upper limit for the br(@xmath8 ) of @xmath6 was determined , assuming the e2 model of ref .",
