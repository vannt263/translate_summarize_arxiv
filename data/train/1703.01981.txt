    "this paper focuses on the passage from lattice theories to continuum ones in the framework of variational problems , such as for atomistic systems in computational materials science ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . for notational convenience",
    "we will state our results for energies defined on functions @xmath0 parameterized on a portion of @xmath1 ( with values in @xmath2 ) , but our assumptions may be immediately extended to more general lattices . for central interactions such energies may be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 are points in the domain under consideration .",
    "we are interested in the behaviour of such an energy when the dimensions of the domain are much larger than the lattice spacing . in the discrete - to - continuum approach",
    "this can be done by approximation with a continuum energy obtained as a limit after a scaling argument . to that end , we introduce a small parameter @xmath5 ( which , for the unscaled energy @xmath6 is the inverse of the linear dimension of the domain ) and scale the energies as @xmath7 where now @xmath4 belong to a domain @xmath8 independent of @xmath5 , and the domain of @xmath0 is @xmath9 ; accordingly , we set @xmath10 . both scalings , @xmath11 of the energy , and @xmath12 of the function , are important in this process and highlight that in this case we are regarding the energy as a volume integral ( @xmath11 being the volume element of a lattice cell ) depending on a gradient ( @xmath13 being interpreted as a scaled difference quotient or discrete gradient ) .",
    "other scalings are possible and give rise to different types of energies , depending on the form of @xmath14 , highlighting the multiscale nature of the problem . in the present context we focus on this particular `` bulk '' scaling ( for an account of other scaling limits see @xcite ) .    the continuum approximation of @xmath15 is obtained by taking a limit as @xmath16 .",
    "this has been done in different ways , using a pointwise limit in @xcite ( where lattice functions are considered as restrictions of a smooth function to @xmath17 ) or a @xmath18-limit in @xcite ( in this case lattice functions are extended as piecewise - constant functions and embedded in some common lebesgue space ) to obtain an energy of the form @xmath19 with domain a sobolev space .",
    "we focus on the result of @xcite , which relies on the localization methods of @xmath18-convergence ( see @xcite chapter 12 ) envisaged by de giorgi to deduce the integral form of the @xmath18-limit from its behaviour both as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath8 . conditions that allow to apply those methods are    \\(i ) ( _ coerciveness _ ) growth conditions from below that allow to deduce that the limit is defined on some sobolev space ; e.g.  that @xmath20 for nearest - neighbours and @xmath21 for all @xmath4 ;    \\(ii ) ( _ finiteness _ ) growth conditions from above that allow to deduce that the limit is finite on the same sobolev space ; e.g.  that @xmath22 for all @xmath23 , with some summability conditions on @xmath24 uniformly in @xmath5 ;    \\(iii ) ( _ vanishing non - locality _ ) conditions that allow to deduce that the @xmath18-limit is a measure in its dependence on @xmath8 .",
    "this is again obtained from some uniform decay conditions on the coefficients @xmath24 .",
    "hypotheses ( i)(iii ) are sharp , in the sense that failure of any of these conditions may result in a @xmath18-limit that can not be represented as in ( [ fnn ] ) .",
    "the result in @xcite has been successful in many applications , among which the computation of optimal bounds for conducting networks @xcite , the derivation of nonlinear elastic energies from atomistic systems @xcite , of their linear counterpart @xcite , and of @xmath25-tensor theories from spin interactions @xcite , numerical homogenization @xcite , the analysis of the pile - up of dislocations @xcite , and others .",
    "moreover , it has been extended to cover stochastic lattices @xcite and dimension - reduction problems @xcite .",
    "however , its range of applicability is restricted to pairwise interactions , which implies constraints on the possible energy densities .",
    "the main motivation of the present work is to overcome some of those limitations .",
    "more precisely , we focus on two issues :    @xmath26 _ the extension to the result to many - body interactions_. in principle , a point in the lattice may interact with all other points in the domain @xmath8 . as a particular case",
    ", we may think of @xmath27-body interactions corresponding to the minors of the lattice transformation ( which is affine at the lattice level ) , such as the discrete determinant in two dimensions , which can be viewed as a three - point interaction .",
    "some works in this direction are already present in the literature for particular cases @xcite ;    @xmath26 _ the use of averaged growth conditions on the energy densities_. some lattice energies are obtained as an approximation of non - convex long - range interactions . as such , even when considering pair interactions , they may fail to satisfy coerciveness conditions for some @xmath28 . as an example we can think of the linearization of lennard - jones interactions , which gives concave quadratic energies for distant @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the coerciveness of the energy can nevertheless be recovered using the fast decay of the potential so that short - range convex interactions dominate long - range concave ones .",
    "in general , coerciveness can be obtained by substituting a growth conditions on each of the interactions with an averaged growth condition .    in order to achieve the greatest generality ,",
    "we assume that energy densities may indeed depend on all points in @xmath31 . an energy density @xmath32 will describe the interaction of a point @xmath33 with all other points in the domain .",
    "this standpoint , already used in @xcite for surface energies in a simpler setting ( see also @xcite in a one - dimensional setting ) , brings some notational complications ( except for the case @xmath34 ) since it is convenient to regard each such function as defined on a different set @xmath35 .",
    "this complication is anyhow present each time that we consider more - than - two - body interactions .",
    "the energies are then defined as @xmath36 an important remark to make is that there are many ways to define energy densities giving the same @xmath37 .",
    "note for example that for central interactions as above @xmath38 may be simply given by @xmath39 but the interactions may also be regrouped differently and in principle @xmath38 may include some @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "this is important in order to allow that some @xmath14 be unbounded from below , up to satisfying a lower bound when considered together with the other interactions .",
    "the set of hypotheses we are going to list for @xmath42 will allow to treat a larger class of energies than those of the form ( [ enne ] ) , but they must be stated with some care .",
    "the precise statements are given in section [ mt ] .",
    "here we give a simplified description as follows :    \\(o ) ( _ translational invariance in the codomain _ ) @xmath43 for all @xmath29 , @xmath44 and vector @xmath45 .",
    "this condition is automatically satisfied for interactions depending on differences @xmath46 ;    \\(i ) ( _ coerciveness _ ) the energy must be estimated from below by a nearest - neighbour pair energy and @xmath47 for all @xmath29 .",
    "this condition is less restrictive than the corresponding one for pair interactions since it refers to an already averaged energy density ;    \\(ii ) ( _ cauchy - born hypothesis _ )",
    "we assume a polynomial upper bound for @xmath48 only when @xmath0 is linear . for energy densities as in ( [ cetra ] ) this in general rewritten in terms of @xmath28 as @xmath49 for all @xmath50 , and all @xmath51 matrices @xmath52 .",
    "this condition is in principle weaker than the finiteness property ( ii ) for pair interactions . examining this condition separately goes in the direction of analyzing first pointwise convergence ( as in @xcite ) and then @xmath18-convergence ;",
    "\\(iii ) ( _ vanishing non - locality _ ) we assume that if @xmath53 on a square of centre @xmath29 and side - length @xmath54 then @xmath55 ( @xmath0 is identified with a piecewise - affine interpolation ) , where the rest @xmath56 is negligible as @xmath57 for @xmath58 bounded .",
    "note that this condition is automatically satisfied with @xmath59 if the range of the interactions is finite , and can be deduced from the corresponding condition ( iii ) for central interactions ;    \\(iv ) ( _ controlled non - convexity _ ) a final condition must be added to ensure that the limit be a measure as a function of @xmath8 . for central interactions ,",
    "this condition is hidden in the previous ( i ) and ( ii ) , which imply a convex growth condition on @xmath60 ; more precisely a polynomial growth of the form @xmath61 this double inequality allows to use classical convex - combination arguments with cut - off functions even though @xmath60 may not be convex . in our case",
    "this compatibility with convex arguments must be required separately , and is formalized in condition ( h5 ) in section [ he d ] .    under the conditions above",
    "we again deduce that @xmath18-limits of energies @xmath37 are integral functionals @xmath62 as in ( [ fnn ] ) defined on a sobolev space .",
    "the integrand @xmath63 can be described by a derivation formula , which is allowed by the study of suitably defined boundary - value problems .",
    "this derivation formula can also be used to prove a periodic - homogenization result . in the generality of energies possibly depending on the interaction of all points in @xmath8 some care must be used to define periodicity for the energy densities . in the case of finite - range interactions we require that in the interior of @xmath8 we have @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is periodic in @xmath27 . for infinite - range interactions",
    "the definition is given by approximation with periodic energy densities with finite - range interactions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after some notation , in section [ mt ] we rigorously state the hypotheses outlined above and prove the main compactness and integral - representation theorem .",
    "section [ dbt ] is devoted to formalizing and proving the convergence of dirichlet boundary - value problems , which is used in the following section [ hom ] to state and derive a homogenization formula .",
    "finally , section [ exa ] is devoted to examples .",
    "more precisely , we show how our hypotheses are satisfied by functions depending on discrete determinants and by a linearization of lennard - jones energies mixing convex and concave quadratic pair energy densities .",
    "finally , in the same section we recover the result in @xcite as a particular case of our main theorem .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 an open and bounded subset of @xmath66 with lipschitz boundary .",
    "we set @xmath25 to be the unit cube with sides orthogonal to the canonical orthonormal basis @xmath67 , @xmath68 and for @xmath69 we define @xmath70 .",
