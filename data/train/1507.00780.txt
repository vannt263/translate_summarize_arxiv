    "current generation radial velocity ( rv ) surveys for exoplanets mostly focus on relatively bright , @xmath7 , stars using single - object spectrographs . since they are using single - object spectrographs",
    ", the surveys target one star at a time and expose up to a desired continuum signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "the @xmath8 cut - off used by the rv surveys is generally driven by the faint limit of the hipparcos results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; current rv surveys deliberately pre - select all of their stars to ensure that they will be dwarfs , chromospherically quiet , and do not have known stellar companions  so that they will be good rv targets . initially the surveys largely restricted their targets to single g- and k - dwarfs ( e.g. the stellar sample described in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this choice was driven on the one side by the faintness of m - dwarfs , which makes getting a high snr in a reasonable exposure time difficult , and on the other side by the rapid rotation of stars hotter than the kraft break @xcite at 6250k , which widens the stellar lines and makes precision rv measurements difficult . over the last two decades",
    ", rv surveys have thus surveyed effectively all of the single g- and k - dwarfs brighter than @xmath7 for jupiter - mass planets out to periods of 5.5 years ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the last ten years",
    ", a new generation of rv surveys arose that targeted m - dwarfs ( m2k and the keck m - dwarf survey , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , fainter high - metallicity stars ( n2k , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and former a - stars that are now sub - giants (  retired a stars ,  * ? ? ?",
    "* )  to name a few examples .",
    "these newer surveys use the same observing mode as previous surveys : single - object spectrographs and exposing to a desired snr .",
    "they are nearly complete for jupiter - mass planets out to several hundred days , though they have yet to survey all of the possible stars available .",
    "as the field moves forward , next generation of rv surveys will target fainter stars in broader observing modes .",
    "this will be enabled by the results from the gaia mission , which will allow for vetting of target stars up to @xmath9 @xcite , and also by the exhaustion of unsurveyed bright stars .",
    "there will also be a considerable demand for rv resources to follow - up planet candidates from the upcoming transiting exoplanet survey satellite ( tess , * ? ? ? * ) and planetary transits and oscillations of stars ( plato , * ? ? ? * ) missions , as well as residual planet candidates from the kepler @xcite mission .",
    "importantly , these photometric exoplanet surveys do not pre - select their targets in the same manner as the traditional rv surveys ( if they pre - select at all ) . vetting the candidates from these missions",
    "will therefore necessitate precision rv measurements of stars that are potentially more active , hotter , more evolved , and rotating faster than the targets of the first - generation surveys .    in all of this ,",
    "understanding the sources of velocity uncertainty in stellar rv measurements is critical .",
    "this allows us to both appropriately understand the detection sensitivities of current rv surveys , and more efficiently design and execute future precision rv searches for exoplanets . in particular , consider a multi - object precision rv survey , which would have design considerations very different from present single - star searches .",
    "firstly , a multi - object survey will image a much narrower spectral region than a single - object survey at a similar resolution , on the order of 100  for a multi - object ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) versus 1500  for a single object survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this has the immediate implication that choosing the wavelength range used by a multi - object survey will be much more important than in a single - object survey .",
    "secondly , a multi - object rv survey may not conduct an extensive pre - survey vetting of targets .",
    "this will give their target lists a higher dispersion in stellar mass , rotation velocities , activity , surface gravity , and metallicity than current single - object surveys .",
    "finally , multi - object surveys will operate in an observing mode more similar to photometric transit surveys for exoplanets , as compared to traditional rv surveys . instead of exposing to reach the same snr for each of the survey s target stars , a multi - object survey will expose for the same time on each star .",
    "this will make the detection sensitivities of a multi - object fundamentally different from a single - object survey in terms of stellar mass , effective temperature , and metallicity .",
    "a proper understanding of how these sensitivities change is vital to the initial design of a multi - object survey , and understanding the exoplanet statistics from the survey when it has completed .",
    "there have been several efforts to study the sources of radial velocity uncertainty since the beginnings of precision rv surveys .",
    "the first description of how to numerically calculate the expected velocity uncertainty using the properties of an observed spectrum was given by @xcite , and who also introduced the `` q '' factor as a way of parameterizing the amount of rv information available in a spectral region , though they do not discuss how this is expected to vary with spectral properties . @xcite",
    "performed a similar analysis , but started from the idea of measuring cross - correlation functions , rather than measuring spectral slopes as in @xcite , which makes for an interesting conceptual comparison between these two works .",
    "the approach used by @xcite was repeated in @xcite , who were interested in comparing theoretical poisson - limited velocity uncertainties against their actual observations .",
    "similar to @xcite , they did not discuss how the uncertainty varies with stellar properties .",
    "@xcite , after presenting their own derivation of the photon - limited rv precision , were the first to examine how velocity uncertainty changes as a function of spectral type , stellar rotation velocity , and spectroscopic resolution .",
    "again , these results were used as part of a general discussion of the capabilities of the coralie @xcite and the ( then future ) harps @xcite spectrographs .",
    "@xcite thus concentrated their analysis on a limited range of spectral types , rotations , and resolutions , and drew descriptive conclusions from their results ( for example , they inferred that uncertainty is proportional to @xmath10 when @xmath10 is large ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite considered the sources of uncertainty in rv measurements as part of an examination into how to optimize rv surveys of gkm stars .",
    "unlike @xcite and @xcite , @xcite did not derive an equation for the photon - limited uncertainty in an rv observation , but took model spectra , added gaussian noise , and then fit for the doppler shift in the noisy spectra using cross - correlation techniques .",
    "the authors intent was to better replicate the true process behind the measurement of stellar rvs .",
    "@xcite consider wider and more finely - spaced ranges of wavelength , temperature , and spectral resolution compared to @xcite , but they do not consider in detail the effect of changing stellar rotation . similarly to @xcite , @xcite restrict themselves to descriptive conclusions regarding the sources of velocity uncertainty .    in this paper , we aim to provide a more thorough description of photon - limited stellar velocity uncertainties .",
    "we do not consider the effects of `` jitter '' sources such as spots , granulation , or asteroseismic pulsations .",
    "similarly , we do not treat instrumental velocity uncertainties like wavelength calibration , optical effects , or instrumental drifts , nor do we consider the effect of telluric absorption lines on the spectra .",
    "instead , we are here focused on the statistical velocity uncertainty one would measure for a photospherically stable rotating star using a perfect instrument through a completely transparent atmosphere .",
    "starting from a basic derivation of how to calculate the velocity uncertainty in a spectrum , our intent is to consider , in detail , the effects of effective temperature , surface gravity , metallicity , stellar rotation , spectral resolution , and macroturbulence on the uncertainty in an rv measurement .",
    "this allows us to make not only descriptive , but prescriptive conclusions regarding the sources of uncertainty .",
    "for example , we discuss precisely why stellar rotation has the effect it does on velocity uncertainties , starting from the shape of the rotation kernel itself .",
    "we are thus able to simply and numerically describe how rotation affects the velocity uncertainty across all rotation velocities .",
    "our ultimate goal is to provide a simple and transparent description of the various sources of velocity uncertainty in rv measurements , so as to give the reader a clear picture of the interlocking forces at work . to this end",
    ", we use our results to provide several simplifying approximations that capture the dominant sources of velocity uncertainty as function of stellar mass .",
    "this allows us to better understand why current rv surveys achieve the precision they do , and to provide guidance for the design of future surveys .",
    "consider a one - dimensional spectrum @xmath11 that is discretely sampled at equal velocity intervals ( e.g. , bins or pixels ) @xmath12 centered at velocities @xmath13 .",
    "the number of photons in each velocity bin @xmath12 is @xmath14 .",
    "we will assume for simplicity that the spectrum is in units of photons per pixel or per resolution element , and the uncertainties are poisson - dominated so that the uncertainty in @xmath15 is just @xmath16 .",
    "we will further assume that these uncertainties are uncorrelated .",
    "although the precise details vary depending on the method and instrumental setup , we can think of the process of determining the radial velocity of this spectrum as a cross - correlation of a template spectrum of the star ( either from models or a previous observation ) against the observed spectrum .",
    "typically , the peak or centroid of the cross - correlation function output by the spectral template matching is assumed to be the best estimate of radial velocity of the spectrum relative to the template .",
    "we wish to determine what the uncertainty is in this estimate .",
    "as described in the introduction , this general problem has been considered before , and the following derivation of the general answer is similar to previous work .",
    "as mentioned , we will assume that the uncertainties in our imagined spectrum are purely from poisson noise , are free of any systematics , and uncorrelated .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that the velocity offset is not covariant with any other possible fitting parameters .",
    "we are therefore , in some sense , determining the best possible precision on the velocity offset that can be obtained , given the structure of the spectrum and assuming only source photon noise .",
    "there are various ways to compute the lowest possible uncertainty in the velocity offset ( i.e. , the minimum variance bound , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for example using a fisher matrix estimation .",
    "however , we will simply use the maximum likelihood estimator and error propagation , which is mathematically equivalent to the fisher estimate under our set of assumptions .",
    "we will assume that each discrete sampling of the spectrum yields an estimate of the velocity @xmath13 of the spectrum with an uncertainty @xmath17 , and the best estimate of the velocity @xmath8 of the entire spectrum is the weighted mean over all the samples , @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "the variance in this mean is then determined from the general error propagation equation , i.e. , by differentiating the maximum - likelihood function and keeping only the first order terms , such that , @xmath20.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from equation ( [ eq:2020 ] ) the partial derivatives in equation ( [ eq:2010 ] ) are then @xmath21 substituting and simplifying , we obtain ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath22    we can relate the uncertainty in the velocity inferred for each point in the spectrum @xmath17 to the uncertainty in the intensity ( photon number ) at that point @xmath23 via the local derivative of the spectrum with velocity , @xmath24 again assuming through poisson statistics that @xmath16 , and subsisting the above into equation ( [ eq:2040 ] ) @xmath25^{-1}.\\ ] ] this is generally how well we can measure the velocity positions of the features in an arbitrary function of intensity versus velocity .",
    "this is similar to the `` q '' factor formulation first used stated in @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the case of a gaussian absorption line . for compactness ,",
    "let us define @xmath26 as the appropriately normalized gaussian distribution centered at @xmath27 and with a full - width at half - max ( fwhm ) @xmath28 : @xmath29.\\ ] ] if we take a spectrum composed of points separated by a constant @xmath12 in velocity , and if this line absorbs @xmath30 photons , then a spectrum containing only this line can be described by @xmath31 ) \\delta v,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the continuum level , in units of photons per unit velocity , and @xmath32 is the number of photons in a particular velocity bin centered at @xmath13 .",
    "the factor of @xmath12 is the velocity span of a pixel .",
    "we can rewrite this equation in terms of the velocity equivalent width of the line , @xmath33 , as @xmath34 substituting into equation ( [ eq:2060 ] ) , we get @xmath35^{-1}.\\ ] ] by the euler - maclaurin formula , we can approximate this sum with the integral @xmath36^{-1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] unfortunately , this integral has no analytic solution . as a limiting case ,",
    "consider a shallow absorption line such that @xmath37 .",
    "now we may analytically solve the above equation to get @xmath38^{-1},\\ ] ] or , @xmath39 in numerical tests ( figure [ fig : deep ] ) , we find that this approximation is valid for lines with depths less than about 10% of the continuum level . for lines deeper than this the exponential dependence on the width of the gaussian increases . by the time the depth of the line is 95% of the continuum level we find that the uncertainty in the centroid scales roughly as @xmath40 .",
    "-0.0 in -0.0 in    the uncertainty in the centroid of a shallow gaussian absorption line therefore scales approximately as the fwhm of the line to the three - halves ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we can understand this intuitively by approximating an absorption line as triangular in shape , with a peak that is lower than the continuum by a fractional amount @xmath41 , and a width of @xmath1 .",
    "the form for such a line is simply : @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 otherwise . for a weak line , the second term in parenthesis in equation ( [ eq:2165 ] )",
    "is negligible , and applying equation ( [ eq:2060 ] ) yields @xmath45 with the same scaling and very similar coefficient as the weak gaussian absorption line case .",
    "conceptually , we can understand this as follows .",
    "the amount of information decreases , and the uncertainty increases , as the inverse of slope of the triangular line : @xmath46 . on the other hand , the amount of information increases , and the uncertainty decreases , as the square - root of the total number of photons . in the approximation of a weak line this is proportional to the square - root of the velocity span of the continuum covered by the base of the triangular line , and thus @xmath47 .",
    "the net result of these two competing effects is that @xmath48 .",
    "this general argument implies that uncertainty in the centroid for all weak lines in a background continuum , regardless of their detailed profile , should scale as @xmath49 .",
    "we demonstrate this explicitly for the other velocity profiles we consider below .",
    "we note that this scaling contrasts with the uncertainty of measuring the centroid of a pure gaussian profile with zero continuum ( i.e. , calculating the standard error of the mean ) , which has the scaling of ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the standard deviation of the gaussian profile , and @xmath52 is the number of observations in the sample .",
    "similarly to the gaussian , we can work through the corresponding derivation for a lorentzian absorption line with fwhm @xmath53 to find @xmath54 this analytic solution is , again , under the assumption that the line depth is negligible relative to the continuum level .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : deep ] , the exponent on @xmath53 increases as the line depth increases , similar to the gaussian case .    often , spectral lines are effectively described with voigt profiles : the convolution of a lorentzian and a gaussian .",
    "though there is no analytic description of a voigt profile , we numerically examined how the uncertainty in the centroid scales with the voigt width .",
    "we used @xcite s approximation for the effective fwhm of a voigt profile , @xmath55 where @xmath53 is the fwhm of the lorentzian component and @xmath28 is the gaussian fwhm .",
    "we directly calculated the uncertainty in the centroid using equation ( [ eq:2060 ] ) for various values of @xmath53 and @xmath28 .",
    "as with the pure gaussian and pure lorentzian , we find that the uncertainty in measuring the centroid of a voigt profile is proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "for the constant of proportionality relating @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we found numerically that it varied as a function of the ratio @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 this form of the leading constant is good to 10% over the range of @xmath61 .",
    "in addition to spectral absorption lines , we will also need to consider the role stellar rotation plays in setting measured rv uncertainties .",
    "we begin by considering the shape of the kernel itself to determine the fwhm of the rotation kernel : @xmath62 .",
    "to do so , we must first assume a limb - darkening law .",
    "for simplicity , we use a simple linear limb - darkening law : @xmath63 , where @xmath3 is the intensity at the center of the stellar disk , @xmath64 is the angle of the surface to our line of sight , and @xmath65 is the limb - darkening coefficient .",
    "following @xcite , the normalized rotation kernel is then @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the rotation speed at the limb of the star . for the case of no limb - darkening ( @xmath68 )",
    "this reduces to @xmath69 to find @xmath62 we then set @xmath70 ( i.e. , half the maximum ) , @xmath71 , and solve .",
    "thus @xmath72 at the other extreme of @xmath73 , we may solve equation ( [ eq:3165 ] ) to find @xmath74 aside for the cases of @xmath68 and @xmath73 , equation ( [ eq:3165 ] ) allows for no simple analytic formula for @xmath62 as a function of @xmath67 and @xmath65 .",
    "we therefore numerically measured the fwhm of several calculated kernels between @xmath75 .",
    "we found that in between the two limb - darkening extremes the fwhm went linearly with @xmath65 , such that @xmath76\\ v_{rot}.\\ ] ] this relation is accurate to better than 5% over the entire range of @xmath77 .",
    "for reference , a sun - like star observed at 5500  would have @xmath78 , and @xmath79 if observed at 10,000 .",
    "now , similar to the absorption line profiles , we may use equation ( [ eq:2060 ] ) to determine how velocity uncertainty scales with the width of the rotation kernel .",
    "we first consider the case of a fully limb - darkened kernel with @xmath73 and equivalent width @xmath2 subtracted from a continuum .",
    "thus the spectrum is given by @xmath80 .",
    "this represents the ideal case of a @xmath81-function absorption line being rotationally broadened by the kernel . after making the appropriate substitutions into equation ( [ eq:2060 ] ) , and again assuming that @xmath37",
    ", we find that @xmath82    -0.0 in -0.0 in    unfortunately , @xmath73 is the only case for which we may calculate @xmath57 directly from the rotation kernel itself using equation ( [ eq:2060 ] ) . for all other values of @xmath65 the slope of",
    "the kernel goes to infinity as @xmath83 .",
    "we were not able to find an appropriate analytic or numeric integral to avoid this , so we instead convolved kernels for @xmath84 with a normalized gaussian of small fixed width ( @xmath85 km s@xmath86 ) and measured the velocity uncertainties of the resulting lines for @xmath87 km s@xmath86 .",
    "we found that the velocity uncertainty continued to be proportional to @xmath88 , with the constant of proportionality varying with roughly linearly @xmath65 , such that @xmath89 this is accurate to 2% over @xmath77 .",
    "interestingly , if one rewrites equation ( [ eq:3192 ] ) in terms of @xmath67 , rather than @xmath62 , the @xmath65 dependence of @xmath57 nearly cancels out .",
    "put another way , velocity uncertainties are not strongly effected by the precise amount of limb - darkening in the stellar photosphere .",
    "the difference in @xmath57 between @xmath68 and @xmath90 ( the locations of the minimum and maximum of the proportionality coefficient ) is only 5% .",
    "this is somewhat dependent on our choice of a linear limb - darkening law , but this result should approximately hold for more complicated limb - darkening laws .",
    "figure [ fig : singleline ] shows the directly calculated uncertainties for a rotation kernel , gaussian , lorentzian , and voigt profile with the same equivalent width as a function of fwhm .",
    "the overplotted lines are what we expect for the uncertainty based on equations ( [ eq:2160 ] ) , ( [ eq:2170 ] ) , and ( [ eq:2190 ] ) .",
    "for reference , figure [ fig : profiles ] shows all four profiles , each one with @xmath91 km s@xmath86 and @xmath92 km s@xmath86 .",
    "-0.0 in -0.0 in",
    "our ultimate goal is to calculate the photon - limited uncertainty expected for rv observations of a main sequence star with a certain exposure time . to achieve this",
    ", we will examine how the velocity uncertainties of synthetic spectra ",
    "calculated directly using equation ( [ eq:2060 ] )  change as a function of instrumental and stellar properties .",
    "so far we have been describing the behavior of individual lines ; going forward we will instead consider the average behavior of groups of lines over an extended spectrum .    from our consideration of the uncertainty in centroiding single absorption lines , we anticipate that the velocity uncertainty of a group of lines should scale as @xmath93 where @xmath3 is the continuum flux level , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the average fwhm and equivalent widths of the lines in the spectrum of interest , and @xmath96 is the number of lines in the spectrum .",
    "the continuum level is set by the spectral energy distribution of the target star , the exposure time , the size of the telescope , and the throughput of the optical system .",
    "the average fwhm of the spectral lines is determined by the spectral resolution of the instrument , the observed wavelength range , as well as a host of stellar parameters such as mass , temperature , age , rotational velocity and metallicity .",
    "we chose to restrict ourselves to stars that are on the main sequence , specifically dwarfs from 2600k to 7600k .",
    "this allows us to parameterize stellar properties in terms of one parameter ( e.g. , mass or effective temperature ) .",
    "this leaves us with seven main parameters that will determine the average fwhm of the spectral lines : spectral resolution , wavelength range , stellar rotation , photospheric macroturbulence , effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity .    for simplicity ,",
    "we chose to quantify @xmath96 , the number of lines present in a spectrum , and @xmath95 , their average equivalent widths , using separate and purely descriptive functions of effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity . thus equation ( [ eq:3010 ] ) becomes @xmath97}).\\ ] ] this is the approximation we will use in our fitting .",
    "we are making an important assumption here : that @xmath94 exists as a meaningful descriptor for a given spectrum .",
    "we intend to calculate @xmath94 for a spectrum as a combination of some @xmath98 caused by the inherent widths of the stellar lines , and an additional line width caused by one or more broadening mechanisms ( e.g. , @xmath99 for spectral resolution ) .",
    "the assumption we are making therefore allows us to determine @xmath98 not by measuring the fwhm of each line in a given spectrum , but rather by fitting how that spectrum s velocity precision scales as a source of broadening is applied to it .",
    "if this assumption that @xmath94 exists as a meaningful quantity is correct , then we expect that @xmath57 for spectra of varying wavelengths will behave roughly self - similarly as we apply various broadening mechanisms , and that spectra over a wide wavelength range will have fitted values of @xmath98 that are similar . for the moment , let us accept this underlying assumption as correct .",
    "we shall see in subsequent subsections that @xmath57 does indeed behave self - similarly , and that a single value of @xmath98 can describe a spectrum s response to broadening for different spectral regions spaced over thousands of angstroms .",
    "we used two different sets of synthetic spectra in our fitting : one set from the bt - settl model spectra @xcite and another calculated using kurucz model atmospheres ( * ? ? ? * hereafter kurucz92 ) .",
    "the two sets provide us with different pieces of information : the bt - settl spectra cover the full temperature range of interest , but have a ( relatively ) coarse wavelength spacing , while the kurucz92 spectra are extremely finely spaced in wavelength but are only available for a subset of the temperatures in which are interested .",
    "we therefore used the bt - settl spectra to examine the effect of stellar effective temperature and surface gravity , and used the kurucz92 spectra to model line broadening mechanisms like spectral resolution and stellar rotation . since one can generically think of these latter mechanisms as externalities imposed upon `` perfect '' stellar spectra ( i.e. , rotational broadening is not an intrinsic part of creating absorption lines ) we expected the results we find using the kurucz92 spectra to be consistent with our results using the bt - settl spectra , once we correct for the difference in wavelength sampling .",
    "as described later , we ultimately found this to be the case .",
    "we used flux - normalized spectra in three broad bands : `` optical '' spectra from 4000  to 6500 , `` red '' spectra from 6500  to 10000 , and `` near - infrared '' ( nir ) spectra from 10000  to 25000 .",
    "the bt - settl spectra used the @xcite solar abundances , had solar metallicity with no @xmath100-enhancement , and were spaced 200k apart from 2600k to 7600k .",
    "the bt - settle spectra available for download use a variable wavelength spacing , with a finer spacing occurring around the absorption lines . on average",
    "the wavelength spacing was 0.05  ( @xmath101 ) in the optical , 0.05  ( @xmath102 ) in the red , and 0.2  ( @xmath103 ) in the nir .",
    "for the kurucz92 spectra we used the odfnew versions of the kurucz92 model atmospheres with no @xmath100-enhancement , and generated the spectra with v2.76 of @xcite s spectrum code . for the optical and red spectra we used a fixed wavelength spacing of 0.001  ( @xmath104 ) and for the nir spectra we used 0.005  ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "in all the bands we set the microturbulent velocity to 1 km s@xmath86 and left the macroturbulent velocity at zero .",
    "we considered the effect of macroturbulence separately .",
    "the kurucz92 models covered effective temperatures from 4000k to 7500k with a spacing of 250k .    to investigate wavelength dependent features , we divided all our spectra into 100  chunks .",
    "this partially isolates individual line groupings , like the mg b triplet , so that we can test whether these groupings react to changes in a self - similar way .",
    "furthermore , splitting the spectra into 100  chunks allowed us to mirror the actual analysis procedures of current multi - order rv surveys , and is representative of the amount of spectral information available in proposed multi - object surveys .",
    "for each chunk , we calculated the expected velocity uncertainty using equation ( [ eq:2040 ] ) . after transforming each chunk from wavelength to velocity space , we normalized the chunks so that each had @xmath106 photon per m s@xmath86 in the continuum ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "we then numerically calculated the slope of the spectrum at each pixel ( @xmath108 ) . by equation ( [ eq:2040 ] ) , this then gives us a velocity uncertainty for each 100  chunk .",
    "we now wish to see how the velocity uncertainties calculated from the individual 100  chunks vary as we vary spectral resolution , stellar rotation , macroturbulence , effective temperature , surface gravity , and metallicity .",
    "conceptually , the effect on a spectrum of changing spectral resolution ( @xmath109 ) , stellar rotation ( @xmath110 ) or the macroturbulent velocity ( @xmath111 ) can be viewed as an externality imposed upon a `` perfect '' spectrum with @xmath112 , @xmath110=0 and @xmath111=0 .",
    "regardless of the underlying stellar parameters , the velocity uncertainty of a spectrum should vary ( roughly ) with the same functional form for @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "we therefore rewrite equation ( [ eq:3010 ] ) to @xmath113^{3/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is the velocity uncertainty of a `` perfect '' spectrum with @xmath109=@xmath115 , and no rotation or macroturbulence .",
    "@xmath116 is the increase in the average fwhm of the spectral lines caused by changes in @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and macroturbulence relative to that of the perfect spectrum .",
    "we defined @xmath117 such that @xmath118=1 and @xmath119 .",
    "we assumed that the @xmath109 , @xmath67 and @xmath111 contributions to @xmath117 were separable , and we find that this is approximately true .",
    "we first considered the @xmath109 dependence of @xmath117 using a kurucz92-based spectrum of a a 5750k , @xmath120 , [ fe / h]=0.0 , sun - like star split up into 100  spectral chunks .",
    "we used a kurucz92-based spectrum  instead of a bt - settl spectrum  because of the extremely fine wavelength spacing available with the kurucz92 spectra .",
    "our kurucz92 spectrum had a wavelength spacing of 0.001 , as compared to a median spacing of 0.05  in the bt - settl spectrum .",
    "though the bt - settl spacing gives a well sampled spectrum for most applications , we will see that for our specific examination of line broadening mechanisms the 0.05  spacing has a noticeable effect , by effectively setting a base spectral resolution of @xmath109@xmath121105,000 ( see figure [ fig : fitabs ] ) .",

    "one effect to note is that the dispersion of the chunks in the middle row panels increases as one moves to the red ; that is , while the optical chunks all behave very similarly , the nir chunks show more variation relative to each other .",
    "specifically , many of the chunks in the nir seem to be less affected by changing resolution than the optical chunks .",
    "this occurs because the less affected chunks , which are mostly at longer wavelengths , have residual molecular features in the model spectra we are using .",

    "note that the bt - settl curve asymptotes to a significantly higher velocity uncertainty at high resolution ( low @xmath99 ) .",

    "if we include a base of @xmath109=105,000 and add this in quadrature to the resolution increase being applied by our gaussian convolution , thereby imposing a resolution floor of @xmath130 km s@xmath86 , the red bt - settl curve in figure [ fig : fitabs ] transforms to the orange line in figure [ fig : fitabs ] and nearly matches the kurucz92-based results . as a further test we also generated a kurucz92 spectrum with a 0.05  wavelength spacing , and its curve is shown in blue .",
    "this coarser kurucz92 spectrum nearly matches the bt - settl results , which makes us confident that the difference between the 0.001  kurucz92 spectrum and the 0.05  bt - settl spectrum is primarily a result of the different wavelength spacings .",
    "figure [ fig : fitabs ] also illustrates why we used the kurucz92-based spectra for our examination of line broadening mechanisms : the unbroadened bt - settl spectra are not sampled finely enough to represent @xmath125 .",

    "there are two connected points to consider here .",
    "first , as we have seen , we mathematically expect the velocity uncertainty to scale as @xmath133 , where @xmath1 is set by _ both _ @xmath99 and the inherent line width @xmath98 .",
    "this means that considering only @xmath99 , as these authors do , does not account for the effect of the intrinsic width of the lines on the velocity uncertainty .",
    "second , as we shall see , for a sun - like star in the optical , @xmath99 dominates the inherent line width ( i.e. , @xmath134 ) only for resolutions less then 6,000 .",
    "thus @xcite and @xcite , who consider down to @xmath109=10,000 , find @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively , since they are largely fitting over the transition regime between @xmath99 and @xmath98 .",
    "@xcite directly measure the velocity uncertainty at @xmath109=2,500 and find @xmath131 , but we believe this result to be a poor fit to their measurements , since this line passes substantially underneath the @xmath109=2,500 point .",
    "indeed , if we take the three points in figure 1 of @xcite and fit them using our formalism , we recover @xmath135 at low resolution .",
    "-0.0 in -0.0 in    if we plot the median relative velocity uncertainty for a 5750k , @xmath136 , star against the underlying voigt width ( see equation [ [ eq:2180 ] ] ) instead of the width solely due to spectral resolution ( figure [ fig : logvoigt ] ) , we can immediately see that the best fit to the calculated uncertainties goes as @xmath137 .",
    "we repeated our procedure of fitting the velocity uncertainty as a function of @xmath138 for the full temperature range covered by the kurucz92 models ( 4000k to 7500k ) , and for the three wavelength ranges we consider ( optical , red , and nir ) .",
    "we found that the best - fit value of @xmath98 decreased roughly linearly with temperature and was slightly different in each regime .",
    "specifically , @xmath98 goes as @xmath139 where @xmath140 .",
    "these equations are good to 3% in the optical and 5% in the red and nir .",
    "-0.0 in -0.0 in    figures [ fig : resopt ] , [ fig : resred ] , and [ fig : resnir ] , show the ratio of our fits to the numerically calculated chunk velocity uncertainties as a function of effective temperature and spectral resolution . across the entire range of temperature and resolution the ratios",
    "have a standard deviation of about 5% about unity .",
    "the largest differences occur in the optical at very low and very high temperatures for resolutions near 60,000 .",
    "our fits under - predict the uncertainties at low temperatures and over - predict at high temperatures , both by about 20% at these specific locations .",
    "we next turned to the effect of stellar rotation on the velocity uncertainty .",
    "we presumed that the effect of changing @xmath67 is similar to spectral resolution @xmath109 , in that convolving a spectrum with a rotation kernel is similar to convolving a spectrum with a gaussian , and that we could describe the change in the line width similarly as @xmath141 here @xmath62 is the fwhm of the rotation kernel . equation ( [ eq:3155 ] ) presumes a gaussian fwhm measurement , so for the purposes of equation ( [ eq:3155 ] ) we will need to calculate an `` equivalent gaussian width '' for the rotation kernel .",
    "this is the width of a gaussian which , when convolved with a spectrum , will cause the equivalent broadening and associated increase in the velocity uncertainty as the rotational kernel . as we have seen in section 2.1 ,",
    "this substitution may be easily made : the increase in velocity uncertainty caused by gaussian broadening differs from rotational broadening only by a leading numerical coefficient .",
    "-0.0 in -0.0 in    to determine the equivalent gaussian width of the rotation kernel , we set equations ( [ eq:2160 ] ) and ( [ eq:3192 ] ) equal to each other and solve for @xmath28 .",
    "thus , @xmath142 as we noted in section 2.1 , the velocity uncertainty caused by the rotational broadening at a particular rotation velocity is only weakly dependent on the precise value of @xmath65 . the difference in the proportionality constant relating @xmath88 and @xmath57 varies by about 10% from minimum to maximum",
    ". we will therefore take the average value , which occurs at @xmath143 , for all of our results .",
    "this makes @xmath144 .",
    "-0.0 in -0.0 in    having determined @xmath145 for rotation , we know wish to know how velocity uncertainty scales with stellar rotation velocity . in a manner similar to how we approached spectral resolution , we calculated how the velocity uncertainty in the wavelength chunks changed as @xmath67 went from 0 to 25 km / s using kurucz92-based spectra .",
    "we used the avsini routine packaged with the spectrum code to apply the rotation kernel to our spectra using with @xmath143 .",
    "as one can see in figure [ fig : vrot ] , changing @xmath67 is similar to changing spectral resolution in that it largely effects all of the wavelength chunks in the same way .",
    "the middle row of figure [ fig : vrot ] shows the relative change in the velocity uncertainty normalized to @xmath146 km s@xmath86 for a 5750k , @xmath120 , [ fe / h]=0.0 star in our three wavelength regimes . similar to our approach to fitting the effect of changing spectral resolution , we also calculated median values for our entire temperature range .",
    "we then fit the chunk averages in the same manner as for spectral resolution . in doing so",
    ", we found that rotational velocity affects the relative velocity uncertainty of a spectrum in almost exactly the same way as does spectral resolution .",
    "that is , when @xmath147 the velocity uncertainty is almost exactly the same across our entire temperature range .",
    "in addition to rotation , we also considered the effect of macroturbulence in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "for simplicity we assumed simple isotropic macroturbulence , so that the effect of macroturbulence with velocity @xmath111 is the same as convolving a spectrum with a normalized gaussian with standard deviation @xmath148 . under this assumption",
    "the fwhm of the macroturbulence kernel is then simply @xmath149    note that in reality , the effects of rotation and macroturbulence are difficult to observationally separate when @xmath150 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is partially a result of the fact that the effect of real macroturbulence is not isotropic , and partially because macroturbulent and rotational broadening are observed as a disk - integrated broadening profile .",
    "this makes the two effects difficult to separate observationally .",
    "typical macroturbulent velocities for field dwarfs are on the order of a few km s@xmath86 @xcite , with mid f - dwarfs at about 6 km s@xmath86 and decreasing linearly with spectral type to about 1.5 km s@xmath86 for an early k - dwarf .",
    "we used the empirical relation for @xmath111 as a function of temperature determined by @xcite , which we list along with other stellar properties in section 4 .",
    "we therefore will use the same results we had for spectral resolution ( voigt line profiles , temperature dependence ) and apply it to rotation and macroturbulence .",
    "putting this all together , we may rewrite equation ( [ eq:3110 ] ) as @xmath151      temperature affects both the width and the number of lines usable for radial velocity measurements in a spectrum , and unlike the line broadening mechanisms considered in above , stellar temperature should be considered an intrinsic part of line generation . without a detailed treatment of",
    "how spectral lines are created , it is therefore difficult to arrive at a physically motivated analytic expression for how the velocity uncertainty in a spectrum changes along with effective temperature . while the thermal velocity width of the lines will scale simply as the square - root of the effective temperature , the pressure of the atmospheric layer where these lines are generated will change as well .",
    "these two competing effects  temperature width and pressure width  are not easily separable .",
    "in addition , the number of lines in a spectrum depends upon a host of factors such as opacities , atomic energy levels , and ionization equilibria that also provide no simple scaling with temperature .",
    "-0.0 in -0.0 in    figure [ fig : teffline ] is an illustration of the complexity of the issue .",
    "we selected three isolated iron lines , one silicon line , and one nickel line , and measured the fwhm of these lines as a function of temperature in a series of [ fe / h]=0 , @xmath120 , kurucz92 spectra .",
    "our naive expectation was that the fwhm of all the lines would behave self - similarly and increase as the square - root of the effective temperature .",
    "instead , the measured fwhms decreased with effective temperature and display an idiosyncratic temperature dependence .",
    "as mentioned above , we attribute this divergence from our expected behavior to a set of competing effects , including varying local pressure , differences in ionization levels , and differences in opacities .",
    "we therefore determined a purely numerical and descriptive scaling for how the relative velocity uncertainty in a spectrum changes with effective temperature . due to their availability over a greater range of temperatures we used the bt - settl models for this fitting .",
    "we again used 100  chunks sliced out of spectra with effective temperatures of 2600k to 7600k and @xmath136 in the three wavelength ranges we are considering .",
    "-0.0 in -0.0 in    the top panels of figure [ fig : teff ] show the effect of changing temperature on the velocity uncertainty for each of the chunks .",
    "it is immediately apparent from figure [ fig : teff ] that changing the effective temperature acts in a much less self - similar way across the chunks as compared to the external line - broadening mechanisms we considered previously .",
    "not surprisingly , while the behavior of the optical chunks is roughly self - similar ( left side of the middle row of figure [ fig : teff ] ) , the nir chunks ( right side of the middle row of figure [ fig : teff ] ) show considerable differences .",
    "this is largely caused by the different line generation mechanisms at optical and nir wavelengths .",
    "while the optical is mostly populated by atomic lines that change strength relatively slowly with effective temperature , the nir chunks possess more molecular lines that have a sharp temperature dependence .",
    "for example , while a 4000k , @xmath120 , spectra from 24500  to 24600  is a forest of co molecular lines , that same 100  chunk in a 7000k , @xmath120 , spectrum has only one atomic fe and one atomic mg line as its major spectral features .",
    "this also illustrates the vital importance of choosing the appropriate wavelength range in the nir when designing an rv survey .",
    "for example , our illustrative 24500  to 24600  chunk is a perfect example of a wavelength region that would be a reasonable choice for an rv survey focusing on k and m stars , but it would be a poor choice for a nir survey that would observe fgk dwarfs .",
    "we consider the choice of wavelength range in more detail in the discussion section .",
    "-0.0 in -0.0 in    to generally describe the behavior of the wavelength chunks as a function of temperature , we roughly approximated the chunk medians by taking a least squares polynomial fit to the three wavelength regions , which yielded @xmath152 where @xmath140 .",

    "replicate the chunk medians to with 4% .",
    "relative to the medians , while the optical chunks are relatively coherent , one can see the moving towards redder wavelengths causes the chunks to vary more about the median , for the reasons outlined above .",
    "surface gravity , through pressure broadening effects , can change both the depth and width of spectral lines , and thus the rv velocity uncertainty of a spectrum .",
    "the exact response of lines to changes in surface gravity is dependent upon several factors .",
    "for example , a decrease in gravity can cause a weak line to either gain or lose strength depending upon the ionization state of the atoms .",
    "we therefore approached surface gravity effects in a manner similar to effective temperature , by determining a purely numerical and descriptive scaling of velocity uncertainty .",
    "-0.0 in -0.0 in    we took bt - settl spectra from 2600k to 7600k with surface gravities of @xmath153 and @xmath154 and calculated the velocity uncertainties of each relative to @xmath120 .",
    "( figure [ fig : logg ] ) .",
    "we again split each spectrum up into 100  chunks and examined all three of our wavelength bands .",
    "figure [ fig : logg ] displays the results for the individual chunks , as well the median velocity uncertainty across all the chunks , and our fit to the median as a function of effective temperature and surface gravity .",
    "all three bands behaved roughly the same , with the greatest relative difference occurring around 4500k and the smallest differences happening towards the ends of the temperature range .",
    "since the chunk medians in all three bands are nearly symmetric about unity , we decided to describe the change in velocity error as a linear function of surface gravity relative to what the velocity uncertainty would be for @xmath136 .",
    "specifically , @xmath155 with @xmath156 . the slope @xmath157 depends upon the effective temperature and the band observed , @xmath158 where @xmath140 .",
    "figure [ fig : loggslope ] shows the measured values of @xmath157 across the temperature range , overplotted by the fits from equation ( [ eq:3320 ] ) .",
    "note that these results are only accurate for surface gravities between @xmath159 .",
    "since the extremes of our considered temperature range , where we expect @xmath160 to be the largest , show the smallest effect due to changing gravity , we expect surface gravity to play a relatively minor role in determining the velocity error of a spectrum . indeed ,",
    "when we include how we expect surface gravity to vary with stellar mass ( equation [ [ eq:4050 ] ] ) we find that changing surface gravity is never more than a 10% effect , and is frequently less .",
    "finally , we consider the effect of differing metallicity , which we parameterized as [ fe / h ] , on velocity uncertainties .",
    "similarly to the effect of changing effective temperature and changing surface gravity , we expected that changing metallicity would alter the velocity uncertainty in a spectrum in a way that is difficult to capture analytically from _ a priori _ arguments .",
    "we therefore confined ourselves to a numerical , descriptive , scaling for the effect of changing [ fe / h ] .    to do so , we used three sets of kurucz92-model spectra at fixed effective temperatures of 5000k , 5750k , and 6500k .",

    "this undoubtedly includes jitter from astrophysical and instrumental sources .",
    "indeed , @xcite find that their measured jitter in k - dwarfs is completely uncorrelated with stellar activity ; they therefore conclude that the jitter displayed by these stars is likely a result of instrumental effects .",
    "since velocity jitter is caused by additional astrophysical and instrumental sources , the appropriate way to incorporate it into our formalism is to add the jitter value for a given star in quadrature to the poisson velocity uncertainty calculated using equation ( [ eq:3410 ] ) .",
    "rv jitter is therefore not a component we need to consider in determining the dominant sources of poisson velocity uncertainty in main - sequence stars .",

    "we now wish to assess the dominant astrophysical sources of velocity uncertainty in rv measurements of main sequence field stars .",
    "to do so , we calculated the change in the velocity uncertainty caused by the @xmath173 , @xmath1 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and [ fe / h ] terms in equation ( [ eq:3410 ] ) .",

    "the specific wavelength information is provided in equation ( [ eq:3410 ] ) by the @xmath196 values given in table 1 , and serves to simply set the appropriate absolute value of the uncertainty .",
    "we begin by calculating how the relative velocity uncertainty scales as a function of stellar mass in the wavelength ranges we consider .",
    "we used the relations in section 4 to determine the effective temperature , surface gravity , and luminosity as a function of mass . for the luminosity",
    ", we included the effect of overall changes in the bolometric luminosity , normalized to a 5800k star , by equation ( [ eq:4040 ] ) , and the effect on the observed luminosity caused by the shifting of the blackbody emission across the specific wavelength range being observed .",
    "we refer to this as the `` blackbody effect . ''",
    "this blackbody term means that the exact results will still depend on the specific wavelength chunk used to calculate the relative uncertainties . for each of our three bands ( optical , red , and nir ) , we used a 100  chunk in the middle of the wavelength range to calculate the blackbody effect . in our tests , using chunks at the extreme of our wavelength bands changes the calculated uncertainties by 5% or less , and does not affect our ultimate conclusions .    as a fiducial example , we set @xmath109=60,000 , [ fe / h]=0.0 , and the stellar age to 2.0@xmath197gyr . recall that the age will set the rotation velocity of stars between 0.4@xmath198 and 1.1@xmath198 , with younger stars rotating more rapidly .",
    "we chose 2.0@xmath197gyr so as to be broadly representative of a typical field fgk dwarf in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",

    ", these figures also show how the uncertainty changes if we fix all but one of the physical processes that affect the velocity uncertainty and depend on stellar mass .",
    "these parameters are changes to line strengths and numbers due to effective temperature ( t ) , changes in the overall bolometric luminosity ( l ) , luminosity changes from the blackbody peak shifting relative to the spectral bandpass ( bb ) , stellar rotation ( vs ) , macroturbulence ( vm ) , surface gravity changes ( g ) , and spectral resolution ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "-0.0 in -0.0 in    there are two things to immediately note . first , below @xmath185 and above @xmath186 the vs curve is for the maximum observed @xmath110 at each mass .",
    "second , the changing effect of spectral resolution as a function of mass is a result of the average inherent line widths varying with effective temperature , per equation ( [ eq:3150 ] ) .",
    "larger inherent line widths ( e.g. , at lower temperatures in the optical ) cause finite spectral resolution to have a smaller effect on the velocity uncertainties .    in general , these three figures demonstrate that there are two general regimes for the rv errors of f - m main sequence stars : luminosity and temperature dominated uncertainties below @xmath186 when stellar rotation is low , and rotation dominated uncertainties for stars above that mass . in particular , the rapid increase in the average rotation for more massive stars means that in all three bands the maximum velocity uncertainty raises sharply in this regime , becoming an order of magnitude larger than it would be for a sun - like star at just @xmath199 .",
    "below @xmath186 , on the other hand , the three wavelength regions behave differently .",
    "this primarily due to the changing effect of the blackbody peak shifting relative to the observed bandpass ( the bb line in all three figures ) .",
    "in the optical ( figure [ fig : erropt ] ) the blackbody effect causes larger uncertainties for lower mass stars as the peak shifts into the red , particularly below @xmath200 . in the red ( figure [ fig : errred ] ) , the blackbody term is nearly constant , as the peak is moving through this wavelength regime . by the time we reach the nir ( figure [ fig : errnir ] ) , the blackbody term finally begins to reduce the velocity uncertainties of lower mass stars relative to solar - mass stars .",
    "-0.0 in -0.0 in    to illustrate this different behavior in the different bandpasses , and to understand the dominant source of velocity uncertainty in a conceptually straightforward manner , we derived simple approximations to how the velocity uncertainty of low - mass ( @xmath201 ) stars scaled with stellar mass . in the optical ,",
    "the blackbody effect nearly cancels the effect of changing effective temperature , leaving the bolometric luminosity as the dominant source of uncertainty . in the red , where the blackbody effect is nearly constant , we approximate the velocity uncertainty as a combination of luminosity and temperature effects .",
    "finally , in the nir , we must also include the blackbody effect into our approximation using luminosity and temperature .",
    "we find that in the nir the bb term is well fit by a simple linear relation with stellar mass , such that @xmath202 .    for our approximations for the relative uncertainty scaling below @xmath186",
    "we therefore have : @xmath203\\ ; f_{nir}(t_{eff } ) \\left(\\frac{l_*}{l_\\odot}\\right)^{-1/2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ; \\mathrm{for}\\ m_*<1.1m_\\odot . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] above @xmath186 , where stellar rotation dominates , we would approximate the velocity error as @xmath204 , as the rapidly increasing rotation velocities widen the lines to unusability for detecting all but the most massive companions .",
    "note that , in detail , since values of @xmath110 are observed to be uniformly distributed in this high - mass regime , some stars will have a @xmath110 low enough that rotation will not dominate the velocity uncertainties .",
    "the red lines in figures 15 , 16 , and 17 show these approximations .",
    "note that we have normalized each to match the directly calculated velocity uncertainty at 0.5@xmath192 .",
    "this serves to account for the added uncertainty arising from our assumed value for spectral resolution , @xmath109 , and the non - zero rotation of the low - mass stars .",
    "one can see the approximate velocity uncertainty agrees well with the calculated velocity uncertainty for lower mass stars , but the two diverge as mass increases above @xmath205 .",
    "this is a result of our ignoring the effects of stellar rotation in making our approximations .",
    "in addition to the above approximations for the scaling of velocity uncertainty as a function of stellar mass , and the general scaling of velocity uncertainty with stellar parameters given in section 3 , there are three general points regarding rv surveys that are interesting to consider .",
    "first , velocity precision does not scale linearly with @xmath10 for high rotation , or as @xmath109@xmath86 for low resolution , as has been claimed in some of the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "instead , as we have shown , it goes appropriately as @xmath206 , or @xmath207 .",
    "this arises due to two competing effects .",
    "first , the intrinsic velocity information in the line scales with the fwhm @xmath1 of the line as @xmath208 .",
    "second , for weak lines , the photon noise is dominated by the continuum emission .",
    "the continuum spanned by the line is @xmath209 , and thus the photon noise scales a @xmath210 . the net result of these two effects results in the velocity uncertainty scaling as @xmath49 .",
    "this is in contrast to an isolated line with negligible continuum , where the precision scales simply as @xmath1 .",
    "additionally , it is also important to remember that the velocity uncertainty is set by the overall line width , which is a combination of the inherent line width and the effects from broadening mechanisms like @xmath10 and @xmath109 . by considering the total resulting line width , we are thus able to fit for and describe the velocity precision as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath109 over the entire range of these two parameters , and not just at the high @xmath10 or low @xmath109 limits .",
    "second , figure [ fig : res ] illustrates how arbitrarily increasing the spectral resolution if an instrument does not give arbitrarily low velocity uncertainties .",
    "specifically , there is a `` knee '' in the uncertainty curves around @xmath109=60,000 , after which increased spectral resolution has a much diminished effect .",
    "this occurs because once a spectrograph reaches @xmath109=60,000 , the instrument is able to resolve almost all the lines in a stellar spectrum ; further increases to @xmath109 therefore do not provide substantially more information .",
    "the precise spectral resolution we estimate for the position of the `` knee '' is similar to that determined by @xcite , but higher than the point of diminishing returns estimated in @xcite , who give a position of @xmath109=45,000 .",
    "this difference is a result of the relatively coarse wavelength sampling in the bt - settl spectra used by @xcite , which imposes an effective resolution floor of @xmath109@xmath121100,000 , as we discuss in more detail in section 3 and around figure 5 .    for stellar rv surveys , figures [ fig : erropt ] , [ fig : errred ] , and [ fig : errnir ]",
    "also show that there is a limited utility to spectral resolutions above @xmath109=60,000 .",
    "one can see in these three figures that the effect of having @xmath109=60,000 ( the horizontal dashed - line labeled `` r '' ) is the dominant source of velocity uncertainty for an extremely small range of masses .    instead",
    ", the dominant error source in radial velocity measurements will either be caused by luminosity ( @xmath211 ) or rotational velocity ( @xmath212 ) .",
    "this means that relatively small detector arrays can be used effectively for multi - object rv surveys : 1024 pixels along the spectral dispersion axis would allow for a 100  spectral chunk to be imaged at @xmath109=60,000 . as an example , if we ignore systematic and instrumental uncertainties , if such a survey observed a sun - like star from 5100 - 5200  with snr=200 per pixel , we predict that the poisson velocity uncertainty on an individual observation would be about 6 m s@xmath86 .    more generally , we note that in terms of statistical velocity uncertainty there are sharply diminishing returns to be made from arbitrarily increasing spectral resolution .",
    "first , above a certain resolution all of the major lines in a spectrum will be resolved ; for resolutions beyond this value the dominant source of uncertainty will be set by the line widths themselves . from equation ( [ eq:3150 ] ) , we can see that this will happen for a sun - like star for @xmath109@xmath12160,000 in the optical , and @xmath109@xmath12180,000 and @xmath109@xmath12145,000 in the red and nir , respectively .",
    "second , stellar rotation will limit the utility of increased spectral resolution  even in slowly rotating field stars . for @xmath109=60,000 , for example , the effective line broadening caused by limited spectral resolution is equal to the amount of line broadening caused by 4.25 km s@xmath86 of stellar rotation . for stars rotating faster than this ,",
    "further increasing @xmath109 will thus provide a small change in the measured velocity uncertainty .",
    "generically , the limiting spectral resolution for a given stellar rotation velocity will be @xmath213 that being said , extremely high spectral resolutions may help with correcting for systematics in observations , by enabling one to study the detailed shapes of the lines .",
    "third , figures [ fig : optq ] , [ fig : redq ] , and [ fig : nirq ] show the importance of choosing the appropriate wavelength for an rv survey , particularly if one can not cover a wide range of wavelengths . to investigate this in more detail",
    ", we collapsed the uncertainty values behind figures [ fig : optq ] , [ fig : redq ] , [ fig : nirq ] , and table 1 along the temperature axis to see what are the best locations for observations .",
    "we divided the temperature range into m - stars ( 2600k to 4000k ) , k - stars ( 4000k to 5200k ) , g - stars ( 5200k to 6000k ) , and f - stars ( 6000k to 7600k ) and took the median uncertainty values across these ranges for each 100  wavelength chunk in table 1 .",
    "figure [ fig : wavemedian ] shows the results , visualized in four different ways .",
    "first , the upper left panel shows the median uncertainties of each 100  chunk for the four spectral types ( labeled `` raw ( linear ) '' ) .",
    "the lower left panel shows these same chunk medians , but now we have normalized them according to the fraction of the overall blackbody luminosity that each chunk occupies ( labeled `` bb normalized ( linear ) '' ) . in terms of figures [ fig : erropt ] , [ fig : errred ] , and [ fig : errnir ] , this factors in the `` bb '' line .",
    "the two right panels in figure [ fig : wavemedian ] are similarly `` raw '' or `` bb normalized , '' but we have now combined the chunks into equally wide logarithmic bins , rather than plotting them linearly as before .",
    "this is meant to replicate the true observing mode of spectrographs : at fixed resolution an instrument can image proportionally more of a spectrum at proportionally longer wavelengths .",
    "the lower right panel of figure [ fig : wavemedian ] therefore most directly informs the selection of a proper observing wavelength .",
    "-0.0 in -0.0 in    in the optical , spectra longwards of 5500  provide relatively little information for f - stars , and provide an inferior amount of velocity information for later spectral types as compared to most of the shorter wavelengths . for a survey covering all spectral classes with a limited wavelength range",
    ", the best wavelengths to look at in the optical would be from 5000  to 5200 , which contains the mg b triplet , and has been noted previously @xcite .",
    "shorter wavelengths than this , while advantageous for fg stars , provide little gain for either k- or m - stars .    in the `` red , '' between 6500  and 10000 ,",
    "the best regions for a general exoplanet survey are in the i or @xmath214 bands around 7000 .",
    "moving further out into the red , to @xmath215 , provides less velocity information at almost all effective temperatures . indeed , as shown in the bottom right panel of figure [ fig : wavemedian ] , observing from 7000  to 8000  in i or @xmath214 has the lowest base uncertainty for observations of m - dwarfs over the entire wavelength range .    to investigate this in more detail ,",
    "figure [ fig : wavemedianmdwarfs ] shows four of the temperatures that make up the m - dwarfs in figure [ fig : wavemedian ] displayed in a similar manner .",
    "one can see that between 3800k ( an m0 ) and 2600k ( roughly an m7 ) the shape of the raw uncertainties as a function of wavelength are roughly self - similar , but the flux normalized uncertainties flatten out as one moves to cooler temperatures .",
    "this is , of course , a result of the peak of the stellar sed moving towards longer wavelengths as the temperature decreases .",
    "nevertheless , although the peak of a 2600k blackbody has moved out to 11,000 , one can clearly see in the lower panels of figure [ fig : wavemedianmdwarfs ] that the most efficient wavelength region to observe all of the m - dwarf temperatures we consider is shortwards of 10,000 , between 6000  and 9000 .",
    "the m - dwarf spectra at these wavelengths have approximately 10 times the velocity information ( i.e. , 1/10 the uncertainty ) as compared to the nir , and thus remain the most efficient observing location even after accounting for the relative amount of stellar emission .",
    "@xcite arrived at a similar conclusion for the best wavelength regime to observe m - dwarfs .",
    "this illustrates the importance of considering the velocity information available in a wavelength region , and not just the shape of the stellar sed , when designing an rv survey targeted at m - dwarfs .",
    "-0.0 in -0.0 in    if we now consider only the nir , it is interesting to compare figures [ fig : nirq ] and [ fig : wavemedian ] against the available transmission windows in the atmosphere .",
    "we can roughly approximate these windows by considering the nir photometry bands : _ j _",
    "( 11000  to 13500 ) , _ h _",
    "( 15000  to 17000 ) , and _",
    "k _ ( 20000  to 23000 ) . for a general rv survey of all spectral types",
    ", the optimum observing band would be in _ j _ , since the uncertainty for fgk spectral types steadily increases towards longer wavelengths . for a survey targeting only later spectral types",
    ", the decision is less clear cut .",
    "_ h_-band has the lowest uncertainty for observing m - dwarfs ( down 10% compared to _",
    "j _ and down 40% compared to _",
    "k _ ) . at the same time , if one wished to include k - dwarfs in this survey then the optimum observing bandpass would again be _",
    "j_. it is interesting to note that the best wavelength regions to observe m - dwarfs are precisely in between _ j _ , _ h _ , and _",
    "k_. this is a result of molecular lines from water appearing in the cooler stars atmospheres , but this same water absorption in earth s atmosphere is precisely what sets the location of the nir observing bands .",
    "we have considered the astrophysical sources of velocity uncertainty in stellar rv measurements . in doing so , we are able to describe the basic mechanisms that cause velocity uncertainties , what the dominant driver is behind stellar velocity uncertainties at various stellar masses and in various wavelength regions , and furnish several points for consideration when designing an rv survey . in doing so , we emphasize that we have deliberately decided to restrict our focus to astrophysical sources of uncertainty , and so we do not consider the effects of star spots , granulation , or asteroseismic pulsations .",
    "similarly , we do not treat instrumental velocity uncertainties like wavelength calibration , optical effects , or instrumental drifts , nor do we consider the effect of telluric absorption lines on the spectra .",
    "we determine general scaling laws for the expected velocity uncertainty .",
    "this allows the reader to estimate the amount of velocity uncertainty present in observations of main - sequence stars using an arbitrary wavelength range between 4000  and 25000 , over a large set of possible spectral resolutions and stellar properties .",
    "this is in contrast to previous work in this area , which has provided results using specific observing set - ups ( e.g. , fixed spectral resolution or stellar properties ) .    at a basic level , we demonstrate that the velocity uncertainty of a weak spectral absorption line in a continuum scales as @xmath49 , where @xmath1 is the fwhm of the line , and not linearly with @xmath1 as one expects when there is no continuum emission and as has been claimed in some previous work .",
    "using model spectra , we then calculated how the velocity uncertainty changes as a function of spectral resolution , stellar rotation , stellar effective temperature , stellar surface gravity , and stellar metallicity . by dividing our model",
    "spectra up into 100 - wide chunks , we find that the effects of resolution , rotation , and surface gravity operate on the chunks in a largely self - similar manner  regardless of the specific wavelength or spectral features within a chunk .",
    "effective temperature presents a more complicated picture , with different chunks behaving very differently .",
    "we numerically fit a rough relation to the chunk medians , but the variation between chunks as a function of temperature is one illustration of the importance of carefully choosing the wavelength range used in an rv survey .    with these basic relations established , we are able to calculate how the velocity uncertainty scales as a function of stellar mass . for stars more massive than 1.1@xmath192 , we find that the rapidly increasing stellar rotation dominates the predicted uncertainties .",
    "below 1.1@xmath192 , the velocity uncertainty is set by a combination of competing effects from changes in stellar luminosity , temperature and surface gravity . in the optical , between 4000  and 6500 , we find that almost all of these effects cancel , leaving the velocity uncertainty to be predominately set by the bolometric luminosity of the target star for a fixed distance .",
    "this is not true in the red ( 6500  to 10000 ) or the nir ( 10000  to 25000 ) , where one must also account for temperature ( red ) or temperature and the effect of the blackbody peak shifting relative to the observed wavelength range ( nir ) .",
    "we give simple approximations for how the velocity error scales with mass for each of these three wavelength regimes .",
    "more generally , our consideration of velocity errors in rv surveys highlights two important points for consideration .",
    "first , after a certain point increasing spectral resolution provides diminished returns .",
    "this primary occurs because once one has resolved the lines in a spectrum increased resolution provides little more information , and because , depending on the stars being surveyed , stellar rotation will provide the dominant source of velocity uncertainty  not spectral resolution .",
    "we find that this point of diminishing returns occurs at approximately @xmath109=80,000 , though we note that extremely high spectral resolutions may help with correcting for systematics in observations .",
    "second , the most efficient wavelength region to operate an rv survey for m - dwarfs is between 6000  to 9000 . although the peak emission for m - dwarfs is generally longwards of these wavelengths , the base velocity uncertainties of spectra in this wavelength region are about 1/10 that of spectra in the nir bands .",
    "this means that even after accounting for the difference in received flux , m - dwarf spectra from 6000  to 9000  will give a lower velocity uncertainty than spectra in observed in the nir at the same exposure time ."
