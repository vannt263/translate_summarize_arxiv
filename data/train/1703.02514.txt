    "there are many possible candidates for quantum emitters , such as , atoms - which have the advantage of being identical to each other , have a disadvantage of the requirement of trapping them  @xcite .",
    "molecules - can be put very precisely to required places but they tend to bleach  @xcite . situation with quantum dots is similar , although quantum dot technology has been improving and research towards making quantum dots which do not blink or bleach is ongoing  @xcite .",
    "defect centers in diamond are quantum emitters which have been shown to be stable .",
    "the most commonly used defect center in diamond , namely nv - centers , have been shown to be useful for certain quantum information related tasks  @xcite . however , the emission from nv - centers is broad due to phononic interaction and only a small fraction of its emission is within the zero phonon line ( zpl )  @xcite .",
    "this has been a limiting factor in extending the entanglement of nv - centers beyond a couple of nv - centers  @xcite .",
    "one of the other defect centers in diamonds , silicon vacancy ( siv ) center , has been shown to emit mostly into its zpl  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that differerent siv centers emit indistinguishable photons  @xcite .",
    "these properties have recently been utilized for the entanglement of two siv centers  @xcite .",
    "coupling of quantum emitters to surface plasmon modes is promising from the point of view of advantageously exploiting extreme mode confinement ensured by various plasmonic waveguides . indeed , efficient coupling of quantum dots and nv centers in diamonds to nanowire  @xcite , channel  @xcite and wedge  @xcite surface plasmons has been demonstrated . at the same time , despite certain advantages of siv centers ( narrow emission spectrum and indistinguishability ) their coupling to plasmonic waveguide modes insofar has not been realized  @xcite .    in this letter , we demonstrate the coupling of siv centers to strongly confined nanowire surface plasmons . for the coupled siv centers , we observe a decrease in lifetime when compared to the lifetime of uncoupled siv centers .",
    "the coupled system is further characterized by the measurement of spectrum and lifetime at the distal end .",
    "to perform this experiment , we use chemically grown silver nanowires and nanodiamonds which have been grown with siv centers . to grow the single crystalline silver nanowires ,",
    "we have followed the method from korte et .",
    "the silver wires thus obtained have a diameter ranging from 80  nm to 200  nm and lengths ranging from 5  @xmath0 m to 20  @xmath0 m .",
    "the nanodiamonds are grown at high temperature and high pressure where si containing compound is mixed in the process of growth of the nanodiamonds  @xcite .",
    "this process can produce siv center containing diamonds in sizes ranging from few nanometers to few micrometers .    ) .",
    "[ figure1 ] ]    for characterization of the siv centers and siv - silver nanowire coupled system , we use an experimental set - up which combines an inverted confocal microscope and an atomic force microscope ( afm ) , a schematic of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . a pulsed laser with a pulse rate variable between 2.5  mhz and 80  mhz with a pulsewidth of 50  ps , or a continuous wave ( cw ) excitation laser at a wavelength of 532",
    "nm is used . the sample can be raster scanned in a plane ( xy in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "we use an objective of numerical aperture ( na ) 1.4 to focus the excitation laser onto the sample , and the fluorescence emission is collected from the same objective . a dichroic mirror is used to separate the excitation laser from the emission of quantum emitter .",
    "we use filters in detection path so that photons with wavelengths in the range 725  nm and 770  nm reach our detectors .",
    "a 50/50 beam splitter is used to split the emission into two paths . in one path ,",
    "the emission is spatially filtered with a pin - hole , and the pin - hole is imaged onto an avalanche photo - diode ( apd ) . in another path , a galvanometric mirror is used to image the sample plane while exciting a quantum emitter .",
    "this feature helps in observation of coupling of quantum emitter emission to a waveguide .",
    "a spectrometer is used to obtain the emission spectrum from the quantum emitter as well as from the waveguide ends .",
    "the sample can also be scanned using an afm to obatain the topography .    ]    first , we characterize the nanodiamonds that contain siv centers . a transmission elctron microscope ( tem ) image of nanodiamonds",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2](a ) , and it can be observed that the nanodiamonds are small ( sizes in the range of 10  nm and 50  nm ) , and they tend to cluster .",
    "we further characterized the nanodiamonds , in the set - up decribed before , by spin coating them on a fused silica glass substrate .",
    "an afm image is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2](b ) , where the height of nanodiamond clusters are upto 300  nm .",
    "we then took a fluorescence scan image of the same area as presented in fig .",
    "[ figure2](b ) .",
    "the fluorescence image , presented in fig .",
    "[ figure2](c ) , shows spots corresponding to the nanodiamond clusters .",
    "subsequently , we characterized each of the spots by measuring their spectrum , lifetime and second order auto - correlation .",
    "spectrum for the spot encircled in fig .",
    "[ figure2](c ) is presented in fig .",
    "[ figure2](d ) , which shows a typical spectrum for siv center at room temperature  @xcite .",
    "next , lifetime for the same spot is measured and tail - fitted to a double exponential decay curve .",
    "we fit the data with two exponentials , which is the minimum number of exponentials that fit the measured data well .",
    "the proportion of the low - lifetime ( 1.19  ns ) component is around 0.98 .",
    "this is a typical lifetime obtained for siv center in bulk diamond at room temperature .",
    "we observe similar lifetimes for siv centers in our nanodiamonds , and the lifetime averaged over 10 such spots is 1.24  ns .",
    "longer lifetime component ( 10.77  ns ) with a small amplitude ( 0.02 ) also shows up , which can be due to the presence of other defect centers in diamond ( such as nitrogen vacancy center , which have lifetimes in this range ) . the auto - correlation for the spot",
    "was subsequently measured , which we present in fig .",
    "[ figure2](f ) . from the auto - correlation measurement",
    ", we infer that the number of siv centers for this spot is 3 . for other spots , in fig .",
    "[ figure2](c ) , we did not observe any dip in the auto - correlation measurements .",
    "this is due to higher number of emitters in the spots , which may not be optimally aligned with respect to the excitation polarization .    ]    to couple siv centers in a nanodiamond to the plasmonic mode of a silver nanowire , we mixed the nanowire solution and the nanodiamond solution , and ultrasonicated the mixture for 0.5 hour before spin coating the mixture on a fused silica glass substrate .",
    "this way , we have been able to obtain the siv silver nanowire coupled systems . in fig .",
    "[ figure3](a ) , we present an afm image of a silver nanowire , diameter estimated 88  nm as the minimum height of the wire , which is surrounded by nanodiamonds . some of the nanodiamonds contain siv centers and appear as bright spots in the confocal fluorescence scan , as presented in fig .",
    "[ figure3](b ) . nd1 and",
    "nd2 were both found to have a spectrum of siv center .",
    "we , then , excited the nds and took a fluorescence map of the focal plane using galvanometric mirrors .",
    "when we excited nd1 , we could observe the emission from the far end of the nanowire .",
    "in addition , the spot corresponding to nd1 is observed to be elongated .",
    "this we infer , is due to the emission from the lower end of the nanowire .",
    "the fluorescence map is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3](c ) .",
    "however , when nd2 was excited , we did not observe emission from the ends of the nanowire .",
    "this is due to a relatively large distance between the nanodiamond and the silver nanowire ( estimated to be @xmath1100 nm from fluorescence image ) .    ]",
    "the coupled system was characterized further by measuring the lifetimes and spectrum of different spots in fig .",
    "[ figure3](c ) .",
    "the spectra from the two spots in fig .",
    "[ figure3](c ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure4](a ) and  [ figure4](b ) .",
    "the spectra observed at both the spots are typical of siv centers at room temperature .",
    "lifetime measurement data and a two exponential fit for both the spots are shown in fig .  [",
    "figure4](c ) and  [ figure4](d ) . by comparing the lifetimes from those two spots",
    ", one can observe that the lifetime at the distal end ( end b ) is slightly smaller than that at the nd spot .",
    "this is due to higher contribution from the siv centers which are closer to the silver nanowire , are better coupled and hence have smaller lifetime .",
    "the lifetime observed for these coupled siv centers are @xmath21.5 times smaller than that for the uncoupled siv centers ( averaged over 5 coupled systems ) .",
    "we obtain the expected decay rate into the plasmonic mode for the wire with a diameter of 88  nm placed on a silica substrate by using a numerical model .",
    "plasmonic decay rate , @xmath3 relative to the rate in vacuum , @xmath4 is given by the equation ,    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the vacuum permittivity , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the electric and magnetic fields of the plasmon mode , respectively , @xmath9 is the wavenumber in vacuum , @xmath10 is a unit vector along the propagation direction ( z ) and @xmath11 denotes integration over the transverse plane ( xy )  @xcite .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are calculated using a commercial software ( comsol multiphysics ) . for silica n=1.46 , and for silver",
    "n = 0.147 , k = 4.799  @xcite , where n and k are the real and imaginary parts of refractive indices , are used . in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , we show the decay rate for the plasmons normalized to the rate in vacuum",
    ". one can observe that the expected coupling of siv centers is similar to that of nv centers for similar diameters  @xcite .",
    "however , the measured change in lifetime is smaller than that observed for nv centers or quantum dots coupled to single silver nanowires@xcite .",
    "this could be due to lower quantum efficiency of these emitters  @xcite .",
    "the emitter can decay radiatively with a rate @xmath12 and non radiatively with a rate @xmath13 , when not coupled to a plasmonic waveguide .",
    "so , the intrinsic quantum efficiency for the emitter is given by @xmath14 , and the lifetime is @xmath15 when the emitter is coupled to a plasmonic waveguide , the total decay rate is modified and there is one additional channel of decay , decay into plasmons @xmath3 as presented before . the decay into the radiative modes can be modified by the metallic wire and non radiative decay channels due to the proximity to metal can also appear .",
    "so , the modified lifetme @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is modified radiative rate of the emitter , and @xmath18 is nonradiative decay rate due to the proximity of emitter to the plasmonic waveguide . for an emitter - nanowire distance @xmath19  nm , @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xcite , so @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the lifetime ratio of emitter before and after coupling to the plasmonic mode of a nanowire can be written as @xmath23 .",
    "as an example , if we consider an optimistic value of @xmath24 for the intrinsic quantum efficiency of siv centers  @xcite , then @xmath25 on average for our coupled system , which is comparable to the change in lifetimes that has been observed for nv - centers in nanodiamonds@xcite .    ]",
    "we have observed the coupling of siv centers to silver nanowires . a change in lifetime for the coupled siv centers was observed .",
    "these changes were , however , smaller than those observed for nv - centers or quantum dots coupled to a single silver nanowire .",
    "this could be due to lower quantum efficiency of siv centers , as has been pointed out before  @xcite .",
    "as outlook , the quantum efficiency of the siv centers might be improved by a change in the chemical environment of the siv centers .",
    "siv centers can be contained in nanodiamonds of sizes around 2 nm , which can make the placement of siv centers more precise  cite2014naturenano .",
    "defect centers in smaller diamonds will also allow for their coupling to gap plasmon modes , which will result in more efficient coupling  @xcite .",
