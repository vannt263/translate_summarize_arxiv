    "a large fraction of nearby galaxies harbor low - ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ; e.g. , heckman 1980 ; ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997 ) .",
    "a variety of mechanisms have been suggested for the underlying power source in these objects , including shocks , black hole accretion , and hot stars .",
    "liner case studies have revealed candidate prototypes for each of these phenomena , strengthening speculation that liners are a heterogeneous class ( e.g. , filippenko 1996 ) .",
    "the liner galaxy m87 is a particularly interesting example .",
    "ground - based optical spectra of its nucleus show narrow - line emission with a complex velocity profile , but no clear signature of the broad permitted lines that are the hallmark of quasar activity .",
    "observations with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) reveal a spatially resolved disk of emission at the nucleus , and analysis of emission from the disk provides strong evidence of shock excitation ( dopita et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter d97 ) .",
    "considered alone , these properties give little indication that the system is related to luminous agns ; yet this object provides one of the best cases for accretion - powered activity in the nucleus of a galaxy .",
    "the evidence takes the form of its famous synchrotron jet ( e.g. , boksenberg et al . 1992 ; bicknell & begelman 1996 ) and a velocity field in the nuclear gas disk requiring the presence of a central dark object with a mass of @xmath5 m@xmath6 ( ford et al . 1994 ; harms et al . 1994 ; macchetto et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "one possible interpretation of the existing results for m87 is that liner emission is caused primarily by shocks , even when coexistent with an accretion power source that may generate substantial ionizing radiation .",
    "this scenario contrasts markedly with the behavior of seyfert galaxies , which have narrow - line emission powered primarily by photoionization ( e.g. , laor 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , the evidence for shocks in the m87 disk comes from ultraviolet emission - line ratios , but the same diagnostics observed in a handful of other liners do not provide similar indications of mechanical heating ( e.g. , barth et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ; maoz et al .",
    "the latter finding may imply that the liner in m87 is an anomaly ; however , another possibility is that the uncharacteristic result for this source reflects the unusual circumstance that its central nebulosity is resolved , and the previous _ hst _ study considered emission from only a part of the disk that did not include the nucleus _ per se_. in order to understand fully the nature of the nebulosity at the center of m87 , and to assess the larger implications for liners , measurement of the uv / optical spectrum of the nucleus is clearly desirable . in this paper",
    "we present the results of spectroscopic observations carried out with _ hst _ for this purpose .",
    "long - slit spectra of the nucleus of m87 were obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on 1999 february 1 ut , using the 52@xmath7 05 aperture and the gratings listed in table 1 .",
    "the slit was oriented at position angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the optical ( ccd ) and uv ( mama ) data , respectively .",
    "( the difference in position angle resulted unintentionally from a roll - angle adjustment during the observation sequence . )",
    "the resulting spectra provide continuous wavelength coverage of the nucleus in the range @xmath10  .",
    "the relatively large slit width leads to rather low spectral resolution ( see table 1 ) but was selected in order to maximize the measured signal in the uv bandpass , while maintaining a uniform aperture dimension across the entire spectrum .",
    "the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) spatial resolution is @xmath11 for the mamas , and @xmath12 for the ccds .",
    "the data were calibrated `` on - the - fly '' upon retrieval from the data archive at the space telescope science institute . all data reduction and analysis",
    "was performed with iraf . with this slit width",
    ", geocoronal ly@xmath13 is blended with the redshifted ly@xmath13 from m87 .",
    "we measured the background geocoronal emission in the g140l spectrum near the ends of the slit , and subtracted the result from each row of the two - dimensional spectrum , making sure that we also propagate errors in the correct way .",
    "spectra of the nucleus were extracted for an aperture size of @xmath14 along the slit ( i.e. , 10 mama pixels and 5 ccd pixels , corresponding to approximately twice the spatial fwhm for the ccd ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure 1 . in order to aid in removing any underlying galaxy starlight",
    ", we generated a stellar continuum template by averaging the spectra of off - nucleus regions that were emission - free .",
    "the resulting aperture was @xmath15 ( @xmath16 for uv spectra ) wide and centered at @xmath17 ( @xmath18 for uv spectra ) southwest of the nucleus .",
    "emission from the nebular disk at these scales is negligible within our aperture , in comparison with that measured from the nucleus .",
    "_ hst _ images show a rapid fall - off of nebular surface brightness with radius ( e.g. , d97 ) .",
    "in contrast with the fos study reported by d97 , which measured the spectrum 06 from the nucleus with a 10 aperture , the data reported here employ a narrower slit , and consequently do not exhibit a signal - to - noise ratio sufficient to measure nebular features outside the central aperture defined above .",
    "we measured the fluxes of the emission features while simultaneously fitting the continuum , via @xmath19 minimization , using specfit as implemented in iraf ( kriss 1994 ) .",
    "we fitted gaussians to the emission lines , and represented the continuum as the sum of a featureless power law and the galaxy template .",
    "the results of the measurements are given in table 2 .",
    "in all cases , the fit results were consistent with the continuum being dominated by the power - law component .",
    "errors were evaluated by specfit from the accompanying error extensions to the spectra .",
    "the fwhm velocity for h@xmath20 is @xmath21 km s@xmath4 , after correcting for the instrumental profile for a point source , and @xmath22 km s@xmath4 if the emission is extended uniformly across the slit ; the latter value can thus be taken as a lower limit . due to the significant intrinsic velocity width and the low spectral resolution ,",
    "h@xmath13 was heavily blended with [ ]  @xmath236548 , 6583 , and the [ ]  @xmath236717 , 6731 lines were also heavily blended with each other ; no attempt was made at deblending these composite features , which we instead fit by single gaussians .",
    "the width and redshift of the [ ]  @xmath246364 template were linked to those of [ ]  @xmath246300 and , as dictated by atomic physics ( osterbrock 1989 ) , [ ]  @xmath25 .",
    "the same procedure was followed for [ ]  @xmath234959 , 5007 .",
    "a joint analysis of the optical and uv spectra is potentially sensitive to reddening .",
    "the fact that h@xmath13 was heavily blended with the [ ] lines makes it impossible to get a direct measure of reddening using the h@xmath13/h@xmath20 ratio .",
    "moreover , h@xmath26 is blended with [ ]  @xmath234069 , 4076 , and h@xmath27 leads to unphysical extinction values when combined with h@xmath20 ; this may be due to an overestimate of the h@xmath27 flux caused by blended emission in [ ]  @xmath244363 .",
    "our spectral range includes the recombination lines  @xmath244686 and  @xmath241640 . for case b recombination , the ratio  @xmath28 ( hummer & storey 1987 ) .",
    "our spectra set a @xmath29 upper limit on  @xmath244686 of 20% of h@xmath20 .",
    "this limit is calculated according to the formula @xmath30(14 ) , where @xmath31 is the root - mean - square uncertainty per ngstrom in the local continuum , and 14   is the measured gaussian dispersion of the h@xmath20 profile .",
    "( this prescription corresponds to a gaussian profile with amplitude @xmath32 . )",
    "the result is (  @xmath33 . employing the extinction curve of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 )",
    ", we find that @xmath34 mag .",
    "the galactic foreground extinction toward m87 is expected to be much less than this value , and independent estimates of the total absorption (  3 ) suggest that the galactic component dominates the total extinction , with @xmath35 mag .",
    "additional spectra of the nucleus of m87 spanning 1140  6820   were obtained on 1996 july 2 ut with the fos , using the 0 aperture ( table 1 ) .",
    "the calibrated data were obtained from the public domain archive .",
    "we measured the emission lines as for the stis spectra , assuming a power - law form for the continuum .",
    "uncertainties in the line fluxes are generally larger for the fos observations , reflecting a somewhat lower signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "measurements from the two spectra are in general agreement although significant differences are present in ly@xmath13 , which may be affected by uncertain geocoronal subtraction for the fos spectrum , and [ ]  @xmath243869 .",
    "in addition to emission lines , there is a wealth of uv absorption features seen in the spectra .",
    "the velocity shifts of some lines are consistent with absorption within the galaxy , while others appear associated with m87 .",
    "we used spectra with the highest spectral resolution for our absorption - line measurements .",
    "table 1 shows that all the fos gratings have higher spectral resolution than those employed with stis , except for fos g160l , which has a lower resolution than stis g140l .",
    "the absorption lines in the fos spectra segregate into two systems distinguished by their line widths ; those with fwhm @xmath36 200 km s@xmath4 are of galactic origin ( and are unresolved ) , while those with fwhm @xmath36 400 km s@xmath4 are intrinsic to m87 , where the fwhm values quoted here have not been corrected for the instrument profile of fwhm@xmath37 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the absorption lines in the stis g140l have fwhm @xmath38 km s@xmath4 , uncorrected for the line - spread function of fwhm @xmath39 km s@xmath4 for a point source ; the velocity widths of many features in this spectrum are potentially affected by blends .",
    "identification of features was based on wavelength correspondence with line lists from verner , barthel , & tytler ( 1994 ) , and consistency tests with the measured line strengths or upper limits for resonance features from the same ions .",
    "the stis and fos observations are separated by @xmath40 years .",
    "the equivalent widths of the absorption lines agree to within the measurement errors .",
    "the continuum level in the fos spectrum is higher by 20% , with greater contrast at shorter wavelength .",
    "tsvetanov et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discussed variability in the optical continuum during 1994 and 1995 , and found differences of a factor of @xmath41 on a timescale of 2.5 months , so variability is clearly a concern when comparing measurements from different epochs .",
    "the physical interpretation of nebular emission in liners is complicated by the fact that several different energy sources may give rise to such emission",
    ". theoretical predictions of optical lines are degenerate in the sense that the same line ratios can be explained equally well by more than one physical scenario , including in particular shocks and photoionization ( e.g. , d97 ; allen , dopita , & tsvetanov 1998 ) .",
    "allen et al . (",
    "1998 ) have suggested that the inclusion of ultraviolet emission diagnostics provides a basis for distinguishing between shocks and photoionization , and uv emission lines figure prominently in the analysis by d97 implicating shocks in the extended nuclear disk in m87 . in the present study",
    "we extend this analysis to the interpretation of the emission of nuclear emission as measured in the central @xmath42 , corresponding to @xmath43 pc ( for an assumed distance of 16.1 mpc ; tonry et al . 2001 ) .",
    "comparisons of our measurements with theoretical predictions are presented in two - dimensional line ratio diagrams in figure 2 , which employs optical and uv lines , and figure 3 , which uses exclusively uv lines .",
    "these diagrams are selected from those shown by d97 and allen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to hold promise for distinguishing ionization processes .",
    "in addition to our stis results , line ratios from the fos spectra of the nucleus ( our measurements ) and of the ionized disk ( d97 ) are also shown .",
    "the diagrams involve intensity ratios of lines close in wavelength , so that they are relatively insensitive to reddening ; the plotted data points have consequently not been corrected for reddening .    predictions for several excitation mechanisms are overplotted in figures 2 and 3 . predicted ratios for shock excitation are taken from dopita & sutherland ( 1995 ) ; for their models , the parameters that produce the range in line ratios are the shock velocity and the magnetic parameter @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the magnetic field strength and @xmath46 is the hydrogen number density",
    ". predictions for photoionized plasma assume power - law continua with a spectral index @xmath47 ( assuming @xmath48 ) , density @xmath49 @xmath50 , and ionization parameter @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the ratio of ionizing photon and hydrogen densities at the face of the irradiated cloud ( binette , wilson , & storchi - bergmann 1996 ) .",
    "a possible limitation of these photoionization models is their assumption of a single population of ionization - bounded clouds .",
    "binette et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have argued that the spectra of agn narrow - line regions can be better reproduced by photoionization scenarios with multi - component cloud systems ; in particular , they emphasize the possible importance of a mix of ionization- and matter - bounded clouds .",
    "we have consequently also shown for comparison in figures 2 and 3 the predictions of a two - zone photoionization model , in which we have reproduced the binette et al .",
    "results using the photoionization code cloudy , version 90.05 ( ferland et al . 1998 ) . in this scenario , matter - bounded ( mb ) clouds filter the ionizing continuum from the agn before it irradiates the ionization bounded ( ib ) clouds .",
    "the mb clouds are irradiated by a power law with @xmath53 , and are characterized by @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xmath50 , while the ib clouds have @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xmath50 .",
    "the relative contribution of emission from the two cloud populations is parametrized by @xmath58 , which is the ratio of solid angles subtended by mb and ib clouds .",
    "formally , @xmath58 is always larger than one , but in calculating the resulting spectrum , it can be effectively less than one if the mb clouds are hidden along our line of sight but seen by the ib gas",
    ".    the measured ratios reported by d97 at an off - nuclear position , and for the nucleus as given here , are different , and figures 2 and 3 suggest different interpretations for the two locations .",
    "a similar inference was noted by sankrit , sembach , & canizares ( 1999 ) based on fos measurements of the /ly@xmath13 ratio alone . as discussed by d97 and illustrated also here , the line ratios for the off - nucleus measurement of m87 are consistent in all of these diagrams with a shock interpetation ; the photoionization predictions , particularly the single cloud models , do not agree with the data .",
    "the line ratios measured for the m87 nucleus are , however , less clear - cut in their interpretation . in figure 2 ( optical and uv lines )",
    ", the nucleus ratios generally fall within the shock model loci and are inconsistent with both single - cloud and @xmath58 photoionization predictions .",
    "however , in figure 3 ( uv lines ) the nucleus measurements fall outside the predictions for shocks .",
    "single - cloud photoionization models are likewise inconsistent with these data ; but the @xmath58 sequence intersects the measured ratios in all of the plots in figure 3 , and in most cases the data are in fact consistent with predictions for a single value of @xmath59 .",
    "this result provides a strong suggestion that photoionization is , in fact , important in the nucleus .",
    "in contrast , comparison of the observed ratios with the detailed shock models of dopita & sutherland ( 1995 ) shows that the optical line ratios in figure 2 are not reproduced by a single combination of shock parameters .",
    "the @xmath58 model remains problematic , however , for explaining the optical line ratios in figure 2 as well as generally underpredicting the strengths of the uv lines relative to h@xmath20 for the nucleus .",
    "is it possible to reconcile a single excitation scenario with the nucleus line ratios plotted in both figures 2 and 3 ?",
    "it is interesting to note that the division between optical and uv lines separates strong transitions not only by excitation energy , but also by the critical densities for the collisionally excited lines : lower @xmath60 for the optical lines , which are forbidden transitions , and higher @xmath60 for the uv lines , which are intercombination or resonance features . as a result ,",
    "increasing the plasma density will affect the predicted line strengths in different ways ; the forbidden lines will become suppressed , while the lines with high @xmath60 will strengthen as they take over a larger share of the nebular cooling . for the m87 nucleus",
    ", increasing the nebular density might thus be expected to improve the success of photoionization models by decreasing the [ ] /h@xmath20 ratio and boosting the strengths of the uv lines relative to h@xmath20 .",
    "nebular components spanning a wide range of density are known to exist within agns , as revealed by line width-@xmath60 correlations ( e.g. , pelat , alloin , & fosbury 1981 ; filippenko & halpern 1984 ; filippenko 1985 ) , and dense components on small spatial scales are explicitly revealed in nuclei through _ hst _ studies ( e.g. , barth et al .",
    "2001 ) .    to investigate these effects , we experimented with @xmath58 sequences with increased densities and found that many characteristics of the nuclear spectrum are reproduced if @xmath61 @xmath50 and @xmath62 @xmath50 .",
    "the calculation results are again shown for comparison in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "the observed line ratios fall consistently near the predictions for the high-@xmath46 @xmath63 , except in figure 2a . in the latter case , the predicted [ ]",
    "@xmath243727 strength is very weak , due to the low critical density of this line .",
    "a likely remedy to this problem is the inclusion of an additional low - density ib ( low-@xmath46 ib ) component that emits efficiently in this transition while minimally perturbing the other line ratios .",
    "we modeled this third component as the low - density ib of binette et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , except that it was irradiated by an ionizing continuum , the same power - law continuum discussed above , which has not been filtered through the mb clouds . to achieve the final combination of high-@xmath46 @xmath58 + low-@xmath46 ib",
    ", we assumed that our observation aperture is filled with high-@xmath46 @xmath64 nebulae and low-@xmath46 ib clouds .",
    "relevant line ratios for each component , normalized by h@xmath20 , are listed in table 3 .",
    "the composite model represents a weighted sum of the three components , and a good overall match with the nucleus observations was obtained with relative h@xmath20 contributions from ( high-@xmath46 mb ) : ( high-@xmath46 ib ) : ( low-@xmath46 ib ) = 0.02 : 0.68 : 0.3 ( note that the high-@xmath46 mb : high-@xmath46 ib ratio is already fixed by @xmath58 ) . the composite predicted ratios and observed values are listed in the last two columns of table 3 .",
    "while the 3-component simulation should not be taken too literally as a physical representation of the nebular structure in the m87 nucleus , the comparison presented here nonetheless provides an important demonstration that a multi - component photoionized plasma may account for the emission - line properties of this source .",
    "the choice of nebular parameters in this picture is not entirely arbitrary .",
    "gas with densities ranging from @xmath65 @xmath50 to @xmath66 @xmath50 exists in the cores of agns , and more general arguments exist for the importance of composite cloud populations in these environments .",
    "in particular , baldwin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and ferguson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have discussed the phenomenon of locally optimally emitting clouds ( locs ) , in which emission in a particular line emerges predominantly from the subset of clouds with appropriately favorable nebular conditions for that transition . in the spirit of the loc models , we conclude that it appears likely that a combination of high - density nebulae emit most of the lines observed in the nucleus of m87 , while lower density clouds lead to the emission from ions with low critical densities , such as [ ]  @xmath243727 and [ ]  @xmath236717 , 6731 .",
    "analyses of other liners have similarly suggested that multiple cloud populations may be required to account for the observed emission - line properties ( e.g. , pquignot 1984 ; barth et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "an interesting point which our high-@xmath46 @xmath58 calculations raise is whether the uv line - ratio diagrams are in fact robust in distinguishing between shock heating and photoionization , if density effects are taken into consideration .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show that the line ratios from the ionized disk of m87 could be well described by the high-@xmath46 @xmath67 , except for [ ]  @xmath243727 .",
    "we again attempted to construct a composite model with different combinations of the high-@xmath46 @xmath58 and low-@xmath46 ib components .",
    "we found that the same fractional contributions of the components used above ( with h@xmath20 proportions 0.7 : 0.3 ) give reasonably satisfactory results , although low-@xmath60 lines such as [ ] and [ ]  @xmath236717 , 6731 remain underpredicted by a factor of @xmath41 .",
    "we conclude that the extended disk of m87 remains a good candidate for shock ionization , but emphasize that the uv line diagnostics advocated by d97 and allen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) may encounter limitations when applied to composite nebular systems that include high - density components .",
    "a consistency test for photoionization interpretations of the nuclear nebula in m87 is whether the central source provides sufficient ionizing photons to power the line emission . to address this point , we employed recent measurements of the nuclear continuum as measured by _ xmm - newton _ in 2000 ( bhringer et al .",
    "these data have the advantage of simultaneously sampling the uv and x - ray bandpasses ; while the central source is known to be variable , we employ these measurements as a representative snapshot of the broad - band continuum .",
    "the narrow lines in this source are neither known nor expected to be variable . in the uv bandpass ,",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ data provide a flux density for the m87 nucleus of @xmath68 erg s@xmath4 @xmath2 hz@xmath4 at 2120  , and an integrated x - ray flux of @xmath69 erg s@xmath4 @xmath2 for 2  10 kev .",
    "we can extrapolate the _ xmm - newton _ uv flux by assuming that the spectral shape is the same as during our _ hst _ observation .",
    "we first attempted to derive an analytic fit to the continuum we measured for the nucleus , using specfit as before .",
    "the continuum was represented by a broken power law subject to reddening , combined with a stellar component represented by the template described in  2 .",
    "the fit indicates that the galaxy starlight contribution is negligible , and the continuum is well - represented by only a power law with a break at @xmath70  , subject to reddening given by @xmath71 mag .",
    "this amount of reddening is reasonably consistent with the value of @xmath72 mag predicted from the galactic column density toward m87 [ @xmath73 @xmath2 ; sankrit et al .",

    "scaling our continuum observation to bring it into agreement with the _ xmm - newton _ data , and removing reddening corresponding to @xmath78 mag , implies a flux density at 2500   of @xmath79 erg s@xmath4 @xmath2 hz@xmath4 .    at higher energies ,",

    "if we approximate the continuum with a single power law with @xmath86 , normalized to match the dereddened 2500   flux , the hydrogen - ionizing photon flux at the earth in the absence of absorption would be 0.12 photons s@xmath4 @xmath2 .",

    "the calculation described above for the ionizing photon flux is uncertain in several ways .",
    "first , it requires an uncertain extrapolation across the unobservable ionizing uv bandpass that contains most of @xmath99 .",
    "in addition , the continuum source is variable .",
    "it is therefore uncertain whether our choice of flux level adopted for this calculation is close to an average value .",
    "the calculation above involves a further assumption that the continuum we measure is emitted isotropically at the source .",
    "if a portion of this continuum is in fact beamed in our direction , our estimate of the photon production available for photoionizing the nebula would be overestimated .",
    "some amount of beaming would not be surprising in light of other similarities between the m87 nucleus and bl lac objects ( see tsvetanov et al .",

    "taken at face value , the models for photoionization of the nucleus (  3.1 ) and shock heating of the disk ( d97 ) suggest that this transition occurs within only a few tens of parsecs from the center .",
    "the absorption lines detected in our spectra provide another diagnostic of material that may be in close proximity to the agn .",

    "the measured wavelengths listed in table 4 reflect the wavelength scale resulting from the pipeline reduction of the spectra , which may be subject to significant zero - point shifts .",
    "the average velocity of the absorption lines measured with the fos g270h , not including lines blended with galactic features , is @xmath103 km s@xmath4 ; for the stis g140l spectrum , the mean velocity is @xmath104 km s@xmath4 . these values are consistent within their uncertainties , and for each grating considered individually the velocities of the individual lines are likewise consistent with each other .",
    "we also fit emission lines in the same spectra .",
    "for fos g270h , @xmath105 $ ]  @xmath242326 appears at @xmath106  , corresponding to a velocity of @xmath107 km s@xmath4 ; for stis g140l ,  @xmath241549 appears at @xmath108   and  @xmath241640 appears at @xmath109  , yielding velocities of @xmath110 km s@xmath4 ( assuming an optically thin doublet ratio ) and @xmath111 km s@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "these results indicate that the absorber and the emitter are at approximately the same redshift . the g140l measurement yields a wavelength for ly@xmath13 of @xmath112  , corresponding to @xmath113 km s@xmath4 , which is significantly larger than the results for the other lines ; however , this finding is consistent with expectations that the ly@xmath13 emission may be modified significantly ( 30%  40% flux reduction ) due to absorption by galactic , resulting in a redward shift of the transmitted line centroid ( sankrit et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we can improve estimates of absolute velocity from these spectra by associating the galactic absorption features with 21  cm absorption measured toward m87 .",
    "results from davis & cummings ( 1975 ) indicate that radio absorption arising in the milky way along this sightline is spread over a 50 km s@xmath4 range , with the major component at @xmath114 km s@xmath4 with respect to the local standard of rest ; this velocity corresponds to a heliocentric value of @xmath115 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the average redshift of galactic lines in the fos g270h spectrum is nominally @xmath116 km s@xmath4 , implying that a correction of @xmath117 km s@xmath4 should be added to velocities derived from this spectrum in order to obtain heliocentric values .",
    "the heliocentric velocity of the m87 absorber is then @xmath118 km s@xmath4 , based on the g270h measurement .",
    "this result means that the absorber is blueshifted by @xmath119 km s@xmath4 with respect to m87 , which is at @xmath120 km s@xmath4 as determined from stellar absorption lines ( van der marel 1994 ) . the data for @xmath105 $ ] in the g270h spectrum likewise implies that the emission - line plasma is also blueshifted with respect to the host galaxy , by @xmath121 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "we carried out a curve - of - growth analysis to calculate the column densities of the absorbing ions .",
    "we followed the procedure outlined in spitzer ( 1978 ) using our observed equivalent widths .",
    "one major uncertainty in this derivation is the detailed shape of the absorption features , since the lines that we detect are not entirely resolved ; some substructure within the lines is suggested from previous observations of the d lines ( carter , johnstone , & fabian 1997 ) .",
    "we consequently chose a doppler parameter @xmath122 km s@xmath4 for consistency with the intrinsic fwhm of the lines as measured in the fos and stis spectra .",
    "we used the oscillator strengths from verner et al .",
    "the resulting values of the column densities @xmath123 are listed in tables 4 and 5 .",
    "given the low spectral resolution and possibility of unresolved substructure in the lines , the resulting @xmath123 estimates should be treated as lower limits .",
    "this point is reinforced by the tendency for some ions to display lower calculated column densities for lines with larger oscillator strengths , consistent with the presence of saturated substructure within these lines .",
    "the results for the individual ions can be used to place constraints on the total column density of the absorber .",
    "each @xmath123 gives a lower limit to the corresponding @xmath124 , which in turn provides a lower limit to the total hydrogen column density @xmath125 , assuming solar abundances ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "the inferred @xmath125 from the various ions , whose absorption lines are not contaminated by absorption from other absorption features , indicates that @xmath126 @xmath2 , except from the column densities of ( @xmath127 @xmath2 ) and ( @xmath128 @xmath2 ) .",
    "the total @xmath125 in the m87 absorber can be constrained by other means .",
    "dwarakanath , van gorkom , & owen ( 1994 ) used 21  cm observations to place an upper limit on the absorbing column density of @xmath129 @xmath2 .",
    "( this value is sensitive to the spin temperature , assumed by these authors to be 100 k. ) since the absorption lines detected in the _ hst _ spectra arise only from very low ionization species ( requiring ionization energies @xmath130 ev to produce ) , the hydrogen in the absorber is expected to be mostly neutral , and this value can thus be taken as a useful limit on the total @xmath125 . as noted in  3.2 for the nucleus , the reddening of the optical / uv continuum and the x - ray absorbing column as measured by _ xmm - newton _ both appear to be dominated by the galactic contribution , suggesting that the absorber associated with m87 has @xmath131 @xmath2 .",
    "recent _ chandra _ x - ray measurements reported by di matteo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) indicate that any absorbing matter associated with the nucleus has @xmath132 @xmath2 .",
    "a consistent picture thus emerges in which the absorber has @xmath133 @xmath2 .",
    "the only potential disagreement arises from the lower limit of @xmath134 @xmath2 obtained above from the absorption lines .",
    "the @xmath242577 line is potentially contaminated by galactic absorption in @xmath242587 , and @xmath242594 suffers a similar problem with galactic @xmath242606 , leaving the @xmath242606 in m87 as the best option for measuring this ion ; the measurement uncertainty for this feature is relatively large , however ( 1@xmath135 error of 26% ; see also fig .",
    "5@xmath136 ) , suggesting that it does not represent a significant inconsistency .",
    "a fundamental question concerning the absorber in m87 is its relation , if any , to the accretion - powered activity in the nucleus .",
    "liners commonly exhibit resonance - line absorption tracing modest column densities , and these absorbers characteristically display a low - ionization state that mirrors the low ionization of the emission plasma in these sources ( shields et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "these absorbers are not particularly exotic in their properties , and a natural question is whether they have any connection to the active nucleus , or simply represent normal components of the interstellar medium of the host galaxy that happen to fall along our line of sight to the central uv source . the latter possibility is underscored by the similarity in detected ions and equivalent widths for the galactic and m87 absorbers ( tables 4 and 5 ) .",
    "while the nature of absorbers in liners in general remains ambiguous , in the case of m87 there are indications that the absorbing material is , in fact , associated with the central accretion phenomenon .",
    "the offset in velocity between the absorber and the underlying galaxy , indicative of outflow of the absorbing matter , is highly reminiscent of absorption commonly associated with more luminous agns , which is often blueshifted with typical velocities of a few @xmath137 km s@xmath4 ( e.g , crenshaw et al .",
    "in addition , sankrit et al .",
    "( 1999 ) concluded that the substantial strength of the ly@xmath13 emission feature requires that the absorber cover the continuum source , but little if any of the emission - line clouds , if @xmath138 @xmath2 , as seems to be the case . the most straightforward way of interpreting this finding geometrically is that the absorber has a distance from the central source and a size that are smaller than the typical dimensions of the emission clouds . since the _ hst _ aperture employed by sankrit et al",
    ". had a diameter of @xmath139 pc , the size and scale of the absorber are probably much smaller than this dimension , which would be consistent with an origin in the central accretion structure or its environs",
    ".    the absorption characteristics of m87 and possibly other liners may lead to important insights into the accretion process in these objects .",
    "the low ionization describing both absorption and emission sets these sources apart from seyfert nuclei and qsos , and likely arises from a characteristically different mode of accretion at low accretion rates .",
    "in particular , physical scenarios employing advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) , adiabatic inflow - outflow solutions ( adios ) , or other low radiative efficiency accretion structures are showing promise for interpreting these sources ( see quataert 2001 for a recent review ) . substantial outflows of hot gas are predicted in some versions of these models ( e.g. , blandford & begelman 1999 ; beckert 2000 ) , and potentially some cooler material is accelerated in these winds , giving rise to the observed absorption .",
    "one quantity of interest for comparison with theoretical predictions is the rate of mass ejection @xmath140 represented by the m87 absorber . from simple geometrical considerations , @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the mean atomic mass per h atom",
    ", @xmath143 is the proton mass , @xmath144 is the global covering factor , @xmath145 is the radial location of the absorber , and @xmath146 is the outflow velocity . assuming solar abundances ( @xmath147 ; dppen 2000 ) , this can be expressed as @xmath148 this result indicates that @xmath149 is much less than the bondi accretion rate for the central object , which is @xmath150 m@xmath6 yr@xmath4 ( di matteo et al .",
    "2002 ) , but consistent with the idea that the absorbed gas may be material entrained in an outflow from the central accretion structure .",
    "observations with higher spectral resolution will be necessary to establish the detailed kinematic and spatial structure of the absorbing gas in m87 and other liners .",
    "the present study of uv / optical emission and absorption in the nearby liner m87 provides several new insights into the nature of this source . within a radius of @xmath151 pc , emission - line ratios for the nucleus",
    "are well - described by photoionization of a multi - phase medium with a range of densities ; shock models are less successful .",
    "the data also show a low - ionization absorber that evidently resides on small scales and is outflowing .",
    "these attributes , along with the famous radio jet , strongly resemble those of more luminous agns , and clearly point to accretion as the underlying power source responsible for the liner behavior .",
    "m87 is , however , a good case for a composite system in terms of the ionization process generating the optical liner .",
    "the emission - line characteristics of the resolved nebula change significantly away from the center ; the emission - line ratios ( d97 ) as well as energetics arguments suggest that mechanical heating becomes important for this gas on scales of tens of parsecs .",
    "if this pattern is typical , larger apertures common in ground - based measurements will sample emission plasma that may trace a complex mix of energetic processes .",
    "efforts to identify a single , or even dominant , ionization mechanism in these systems may thus be unproductive , although the question of whether alternatives to accretion power are important provides a good reason to conduct detailed investigations of other liner galaxies that lack broad lines or other clear signatures of accretion .",

    "<S> if this source is at all representative , it suggests that many liners may be composite in terms of the energetic processes that give rise to the emission spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we also report measurements of resonance - line absorption for the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption spectrum , like the emission lines , is characterized by low ionization . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption line measurements coupled with independent constraints suggest a total hydrogen column density of @xmath1 @xmath2 , outflowing from the galaxy center with a velocity of @xmath3 km s@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematic signature of an outflow , along with evidence that the absorber covers the power - law continuum source but not the emission - line clouds , suggests that the absorbing matter is related to accretion phenomena in the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of such an outflow resembles similar behavior in luminous agns , although the low ionization that characterizes liners is probably indicative of a different mode of accretion in these sources . </S>"
