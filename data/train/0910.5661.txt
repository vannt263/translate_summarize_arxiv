    "one of the most challenging contemporary problems in physics is the search for possible new physics beyond the well known standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles @xcite .",
    "apart from using gigantic accelerators at high - energy scales , it is also possible to use high precision , albeit , low - energy table top atomic experiments , such as , the measurement of atomic parity violation , in combination with accurate relativistic many - body calculations of the atomic parity nonconserving transition amplitude , @xmath0 to achieve this goal @xcite .",
    "some of the prominent signatures of physics beyond the sm which can be inferred from these atomic experiments are : a tight limit on the mass of extra z - bosons , precise value of the weinberg angle , limit to the radiative corrections for the electron - nuclear weak interactions etc @xcite .",
    "as some of these sm results are known to high precision , they demand similar sub - one percent accuracies in both the measurements and the atomic calculations . as the interaction hamiltonian for the atomic parity violation ( apv ) due to the nuclear spin - independent ( nsi ) electron - nucleus interactions is proportional to @xmath1 where @xmath2 being the atomic number @xcite , heavy atomic systems are chosen for the study of apv effects .",
    "a series of apv experiments on a number of atomic systems , including those of cs @xcite and tl @xcite have been carried out .",
    "however , the high accuracy of @xmath3 has been achieved only for cs .",
    "furthermore , a number of ab initio calculations of apv amplitudes in cs have been carried out using a variety of many - body approaches .",
    "some results based on the relativistic coupled - cluster ( rcc ) theory are also available for cs , however , their accuracies are somewhat uncertain , since most of them have used the sum - over - states approach which considers contributions from the core orbitals approximately and accounts for only a selected number of excited states whose contributions are dominant .",
    "in addition , the doubly excited intermediate atomic states and the normalization of the rcc wave functions are treated only approximately .",
    "we have developed a technique in the frame work of rcc theory that circumvents these drawbacks and it has been employed earlier in the calculation of the @xmath4 amplitudes in ba@xmath5 @xcite and ra@xmath5 @xcite in which we have demonstrated that the accuracies of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , were possible .    in this work ,",
    "we employ the new rcc approach , mentioned above , to study various correlation effects in the parity violating amplitudes in cs and fr .",
    "we report a comparative study of their results along with those reported previously .",
    "denoted by solid curved line ) and the weak ( with the exchange of heavy boson @xmath8 denoted by straight dashed line ) interactions.,width=188 ]    the dominant interaction in an atom is the electromagnetic interaction which , as well known , conserves parity .",
    "however , there is a non - zero probability of the interaction between the electrons and the nucleus of an atom due to the weak force with the exchange of a @xmath8 boson , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which violates parity .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian between the electrons and the nucleus due to the weak interaction can have two components : one , vector  axial - vector and the other , axial - vector  vector currents .",
    "the latter depends on the nuclear spin and most of its contribution cancels out except from the odd nucleon and hence , it is relatively smaller in magnitude @xcite than the former ; the nsi component . in this work",
    ", we shall consider the apv effect due to the nsi component alone .",
    "the apv interaction hamiltonian due to the nsi component is given by , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the fermi constant , @xmath11 is the electron density over the nucleus and @xmath12 , is the product of the four dirac matrices that involve electron spin , and @xmath13 is the nuclear weak charge , which is equal to @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the electron - proton and the electron - neutron coupling constants for the atomic ( @xmath2 ) and neutron ( @xmath17 ) numbers , respectively .",
    "the values of these coupling constants predicted by the sm , in the lowest order of electroweak interaction ( at the tree level ) , are given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the weinberg angle and its measured value is @xmath20 @xcite . substituting these values in @xmath13",
    ", we get @xmath21 which is proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "hence , the perturbation due to @xmath22 is generally expressed in the scale of @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath22 does not commute with the parity operator , its inclusion with the atomic hamiltonian of the electromagnetic interaction , which commutes with the parity operator , mixes the opposite parity states of same angular momentum .",
    "the strength of this interaction is sufficiently weak , which justifies its consideration as a first - order perturbation .",
    "the dirac - coulomb ( dc ) hamiltonian used , here , in the calculation of the atomic wave functions of definite parity is given by @xmath24 + \\sum_{i >",
    "j } \\frac{1}{r_{ij } } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eqn3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the velocity of light , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the dirac matrices ( note that @xmath28 ) and @xmath29 is the nuclear potential .    the atomic wave functions ( @xmath30 ) corresponding to @xmath31 can be considered as the unperturbed wave functions .",
    "the total wave function of a system including the first order correction due to the interaction hamiltonian @xmath22 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the first order perturbed wave function of its unperturbed valence state @xmath30 and @xmath10 is used as a coupling constant .",
    "electric dipole ( e1 ) transitions between the states of same parity are forbidden due to the electromagnetic selection rules . however , an e1 transition between the states of mixed parity , mixed due to @xmath22 interaction , is possible and the corresponding transition amplitude can be expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the e1 operator , the subscripts @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote initial and final valence orbitals , respectively .    expanding the total wave function as given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 ] ) and retaining the terms only up to first order in @xmath10 , we get @xmath38 where the subscripts @xmath39 and @xmath40 represent the intermediate unperturbed states .",
    "we have used , here , the explicit form for the first order wave function given by @xmath41    an important question we address in this paper is : how significant are the contributions from those states which were considered approximately in the sum - over - states approach and how they vary with the size of the systems ? we would address this by carrying out a comparative study of @xmath4 results in two systems , namely cs and fr , of different atomic sizes . in order for the contributions of these higher excited states to be included , it is necessary to solve the first order perturbation equation directly . in other words , it is necessary to solve the equation following equation @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the first order correction to @xmath44 which , however , vanishes in the present case .",
    "the rcc method , which is equivalent to all order perturbation theory , has been used in the recent past and accurate results have been reported for many single valence systems @xcite . in the rcc framework",
    ", the wave function of a single valence atom can be expressed as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the reference state constructed from the dirac - fock ( df ) wave function @xmath47 of the closed - shell configuration by appending the valence electron n , that is , @xmath48 where @xmath49 represents a creation operator which creates the valence electron @xmath50 .",
    "here @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the rcc excitation operators which excite electrons from @xmath47 and @xmath53 , respectively , due to the residual coulomb interactions .",
    "the corresponding excitation amplitudes are obtained by solving the following equations @xmath54 with the superscript @xmath55 representing the singly and doubly excited states from the corresponding reference states and the wide - hat symbol over @xmath56 represent the linked terms of normal order atomic hamiltonian @xmath57 and rcc operator @xmath51 . in the ccsd ( cc with single and double excitations )",
    "approximation , the corresponding rcc operators are defined by @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the closed - shell and single valence open - shell systems , respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath60 in the above expression is the electron affinity energy ( or negative of the ionization potential ( ip ) ) for the valence electron which is evaluated by @xmath61 in addition to having considered full singles and doubles in the ccsd equations given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn11 ] ) , we have also included the contributions from the important triple excitations perturbatively ( known in the literature as ccsd(t ) method ) by defining @xmath62 where the superscript @xmath63 denotes the perturbation and their contributions to @xmath60 are evaluating as @xmath64 after solving for the amplitudes of @xmath51 , we solve eqs .",
    "( [ eqn11 ] ) and ( [ eqn14 ] ) simultaneously and obtain the amplitudes of @xmath52 operators .",
    "now , the total atomic wave function in the presence of @xmath22 is expressed , in the rcc ansatz , as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the first order perturbed amplitudes corresponding to the unperturbed rcc operators @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively . on expanding the above equation keeping the terms only up to first order in @xmath10 yields @xmath68    comparing the above equation with eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 ] ) , we get @xmath69    in order to calculate @xmath70 as a solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqn8 ] ) in the rcc theory , we solve the excitation operator amplitudes of @xmath66 and @xmath67 using the following equations @xmath71 and @xmath72 after solving eq .",
    "( [ eqn10 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eqn11 ] ) , respectively . in the above expression ,",
    "notation @xmath73 is used for the connecting terms between @xmath22 and @xmath51 . to keep the level of approximation uniform through out , both @xmath66 and @xmath67 are truncated at single and double excitations by defining @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 correspond to the perturbed single excitations and @xmath78 and @xmath79 correspond to the perturbed double excitations , from closed- and open - shells , respectively .",
    "since both the perturbed single and double excitation amplitudes are solved simultaneously , certain correlation effects due to the perturbed double excitations also reflect indirectly in the contributions of the perturbed single excitations .    after obtaining the unperturbed and the perturbed rcc operator amplitudes in both the closed - shell and one - valence open - shell atoms ,",
    "we proceed to calculate the @xmath4 amplitude as @xmath80 [ eqn24 ] where we define @xmath81 and @xmath82 . the non - truncative series for @xmath83 and @xmath84",
    "are expanded using the wick s generalized theorem and are truncated when the terms are below fifth order of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the core - valence and valence correlation contributions are obtained from @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , along with their conjugate terms .",

    "although , the ccsd(t ) method described here , accounts for the contributions from the important unperturbed triple excitations it fails to include the direct triple excitation contributions to the @xmath4 calculations . to account for , at least , the lowest order direct triple excitation contributions ( minimum up to fourth order in coulomb interaction ) ,",
    "we construct them with the open - shell rcc operators perturbatively as follows @xmath89 and @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the single particle energy of an orbital @xmath36 .",
    "these operators are finally considered as parts of @xmath52 and @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn24 ] ) .",
    "this can be called as lo - ccsdvt approximation , which also accounts important lower order valence triple excitation effects in the final property calculations .",
    "we have used gaussian type functions @xmath92 to construct the df orbitals where @xmath93 is an arbitrary parameter which has to be chosen and @xmath94 represents a radial grid given by @xmath95 \\label{eqn27}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the step size @xmath96 is taken to be @xmath97 , the radial grid is increased up to @xmath98 , @xmath99 is @xmath100 in atomic units and @xmath101 is the radial quantum number of the orbitals . here",
    "@xmath93s are chosen to satisfy the even tempering condition @xmath102 and we have chosen different @xmath103 and @xmath27 values for different symmetries ( @xmath104 ) ( known as even tempered basis ) and they are given in table [ tab1 ] .    .used @xmath103 and @xmath27 parameters for different symmetries ( @xmath104 ) to construct df orbitals using gtos in cs and fr .

    "it is evident that the trends of the contributions from the different rcc terms are similar for both cs and fr .",
    "the important contributions come from three terms : @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 and their corresponding conjugate terms where @xmath110 is the effective one - body terms of @xmath83 and bare operator @xmath111 is its lowest order term .",
    "other terms correspond to higher order rcc terms , but they are not small .",
    "contributions given as @xmath112 represent the rcc terms that come from the effective two - body terms of @xmath83 after contracting with the open - shell rcc terms .",
    "we give diagrammatic representations of the above three rcc terms in fig [ fig2 ] ( without their conjugate terms ) and their lowest order terms . from this figure",
    ", it can be noticed that @xmath109 and @xmath107 contain the lowest order df contributions from the core ( hole ) and virtual orbitals , respectively ; hence @xmath107 always gives the largest contribution .",
    "again , the perturbed states arising through the ground state contribute predominantly while contributions from the perturbed excited states are comparatively smaller than those corresponding to the ground state but with the opposite signs .",
    "the final results are the outcome of these cancellations .",
    "the most core correlation effects are coming from @xmath109 and its conjugate terms while there are small contributions that come from @xmath113 and its conjugate terms which are included in `` others '' .",
    "as seen these correlation effects mostly cancel out with their corresponding conjugate terms in both the systems .",
    "the contributions from singly excited states can be estimated by summing the total contributions from @xmath107 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and their conjugate rcc terms .",
    "the remaining contributions are come from the doubly excited states apart from the normalization corrections to the rcc wave functions . after accounting the corresponding corrections from the normalization of the wave functions to various rcc operators , we get contributions as @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 from the core correlation , singly excited states and doubly excited states , respectively , in cs .",
    "similarly , we get the contributions as @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 from the core correlation , singly excited states and doubly excited states , respectively , in fr . clearly , the core correlation and doubly excited states contributions in fr are large . in cs and fr , the doubly excited states contributions are around 1% and 2% , respectively , with opposite signs . hence , these contributions should also be accounted accurately for high precision results .     and",
    "@xmath37 represent the initial and final orbitals , @xmath122 is the pnc operator and @xmath123 is the two - body part of the coulomb interaction hamiltonian .",
    "lines going up and down with single arrows represent virtual and hole ( core ) orbitals and lines with double arrows represent attached valence orbitals to the closed - shell df wave function.,width=321 ]    to understand more clearly about the role of different excited states that play important roles in the @xmath4 result of cs through our rcc approach which have also been studied by other methods , we consider some of the important rcc terms and analyze their contributions through various excitations level .",
    "these results are given explicitly in table [ tab4 ] .",
    "as noticed , only @xmath124 and @xmath125 core orbitals are important to account the core correlation effects ; this is because the single particle energy levels between these orbitals with the valence electrons are small .",
    "the singly excited states from @xmath126 to @xmath127 contribute predominantly , but there are also significant contributions from some of the continuum states .",
    "the continuum orbital , @xmath128 , whose density in the nuclear region is large .",
    "there are various doubly excited states that play important roles , mainly from the @xmath129k@xmath130 to @xmath131l@xmath132 and @xmath131k@xmath130 to @xmath129l@xmath132 excitations for any arbitrary principal quantum numbers k and l , in calculating the above quantities but mostly they cancel each other .",
    "therefore , a suitable choice of basis functions and an accurate many - body method are necessary for accounting these contributions precisely .        to compare the role of the correlation effects in calculating @xmath4 amplitudes in cs and fr",
    ", we compare the df results and then their final results .",
    "it is about 20% in cs , but it is only about 7% in fr .",
    "the small correlation effects in fr is because of strong cancellations between the contributions from the initial and final perturbed states .",
    "again , it is interesting to note that the ccsd results were larger than the ccsd(t ) results suggesting that there were cancellations from the triple excitations . using the lo - ccsdvt method , these results increase in cs slightly but cancel out in fr .",
    "the triple excitation effects in fr are strong enough to be taken seriously into account for high precision results . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we give some of the important rcc diagrams ( without their conjugate terms ) that give large contributions through the lo - ccsdvt method . in the future",
    ", we would like to study other relevant properties in order to determine the accuracy of our calculated @xmath4 amplitudes in these systems .",
    "we have applied the relativistic coupled - cluster method to calculate the atomic parity violating effects in cs and fr which involve the interplay of the long range electrostatic interactions and the short range weak interactions .",
    "the present approach considers the coulomb interaction up to all orders and the weak interaction between the nucleus and the electrons up to first order . from the detailed analysis of different contributions ,",
    "it is clear that the doubly excited states play an important role in obtaining precise results .",
    "these contributions are quite large in magnitude , however , with opposite signs , than those of the singly excited states in fr , resulting in a large cancellation in the final results .",
    "they are about 1% in cs , for which the experimental accuracies have been claimed to be around 0.35% .",
    "this suggests that , it requires a method like our present approach to consider them accurately for high precision calculations .",
