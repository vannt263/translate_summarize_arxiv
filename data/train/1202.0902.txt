    "the _ integer quantum hall effect _ ( iqhe ) reveals a variety of surprising and attractive physical features , and has been the subject of several investigations ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , a complete spectral analysis of the schrdinger operator for a single particle moving in a plane in a periodic potential and subject to an uniform orthogonal magnetic field of strength @xmath0 ( _ magnetic bloch electron _ ) is extremely difficult .",
    "thus the need for simpler effective models which hopefully capture ( some of ) the main physical features in suitable physical regimes .    in the limit of a strong magnetic field ,",
    "@xmath1 , the iqhe is well described by an effective harper operator ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . for this model",
    "the quantization ( in units of @xmath2 ) of the hall conductance has a geometric meaning being related to chern numbers of suitable naturally bundles associated to spectral projections of the operator .",
    "a family of diophantine equations , the tknn - equations of @xcite , provides a recipe for computing such integers .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to derive a generalized version of the tknn - equations yielding the hall conductances for more general dirac - like harper operators .",
    "interest in such generalizations comes also from these dirac - like operators appearing naturally in important physical models , notably models for the graphene .    with @xmath3 ,",
    "the effective harper operator is @xmath4 acting on the hilbert space @xmath5 . that this operator is the simplest representative of a large family of generalized harper operators , sharing similar mathematical properties , is our starting point . on the hilbert space @xmath6",
    "consider the unitary operators @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "they are readily seen to obey the relation @xmath9 yielding for the harper operator the expression @xmath10 .    for any positive integer @xmath11 on the vector space @xmath12 consider two unitary @xmath13 matrices @xmath14 and @xmath15 defined as follows .",

    "the integer @xmath26 is chosen coprime with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "as for the case before ( when @xmath27 ) , the operators ( [ eq_006 ] ) also obey the relation ( [ nct ] ) : @xmath28 following the definition ( [ eq_001 ] ) we can introduce the",

    "@xmath30    more generally one considers the collection @xmath31 of bounded operators on the hilbert space @xmath32 generated by the unitaries @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "technically @xmath31 is a @xmath35-algebra , i.e. an involutive algebra closed with respect to the operator norm , and it is named the _ ( ir)rational rotation algebra _ or the _ noncommutative torus algebra _ @xcite .    by writing the operator in ( [ eq_001 ] ) as @xmath36 with @xmath37 in particular , the generalized @xmath38-harper operator @xmath39 is just @xmath40 acting on @xmath41 .",
    "this operator provides an interesting effective model for the iqhe on graphene @xcite .",
    "moreover , dirac - like operators like @xmath42 can be used to describe effective models for electrons interacting with the periodic structure of a crystal through a periodic ( internal ) magnetic field and subjected to the action of an external strong magnetic field @xcite .",
    "for rational deformation parameter , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 taken to be coprime here and after ) , any family of operators @xmath31 can be decomposed in a continuous way according to a generalized version of the bloch theorem .",

    "the unitary map @xmath57 implementing the bundle representation of @xmath31 is called _ ( generalized ) bloch - floquet transform _ @xcite . for the details of the proof of prop .",
    "a , that we briefly sketch , we refer to @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "denote with @xmath58 , @xmath59 the unique solution of @xmath60 ( due to @xmath19 and @xmath61 being coprime ) and be @xmath62 .",
