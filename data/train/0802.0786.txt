    "the interest in in - medium properties of hadrons has been growing over the last decade because of a possible connection with broken symmetries of qcd and their partial restoration inside nuclear matter .",
    "nearly two decades ago there were sophisticated theoretical predictions that masses of vector mesons should generally decrease in medium as a function of density due to a partial restoration of chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "specifically , there existed well - worked out predictions that the scalar @xmath2 strength should decrease in medium and that the vector meson masses should drop @xcite .",
    "all of these calculations were performed for idealized situations ( infinite cold nuclear matter at rest ) and little attention was paid to the actual observability of these predicted changes . at the same time experiments ( ceres , taps ) seemed to show the predicted behavior .",
    "the ceres results indicated a significant broadening of the @xmath3 meson in medium @xcite , whereas the taps results on the @xmath2 strength exhibited the predicted lowering of the @xmath4 strength inside nuclei @xcite .",
    "most recently , the cb / taps@elsa experiment has also obtained an indication for a lowering of the @xmath0 meson mass in nuclei @xcite .",
    "other interesting data in this context have been obtained by groups at jlab @xcite , kek @xcite and cern @xcite .",
    "while experiments with relativistic or ultrarelativistic heavy ions have the advantage that high densities can be produced , they have the disadvantage that any observed signal naturally is a time - integral over the whole collision history . on the other hand , experiments with microscopic probes on cold nuclei have the advantage that they proceed closer to equilibrium , even though the densities probed are much lower .",
    "we have focussed our work on in - medium properties of hadrons on two steps .",
    "first , we have performed state - of - the - art calculations of vector meson spectral functions in cold nuclear matter .",
    "second , we have followed closely the cb / taps@elsa experiment and have performed various feasibility studies and analyses of this experiment searching for in - medium changes of the @xmath0 meson in medium . in a third step",
    "we have also analyzed the lowering of scalar strength in nuclei , predicted as a signature for chiral symmetry restoration , and indeed observed by the taps experiment .",
    "while the predicted drop of the chiral condensate with density @xcite is a rather robust result the connection between chiral condensates on one hand and hadronic spectral functions on the other can not simply be inferred from looking at the dependence of the condensate on density and temperature . instead ,",
    "the connection is much more indirect ; only an integral over the spectral function can be linked via the qcd sum rule to the condensate behavior in medium . in an abbreviated form",
    "this connection is given by @xmath5 with @xmath6 and some subtraction constants @xmath7 .",
    "here @xmath8 represents a wilson s operator expansion of the current - current correlator in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom in the space - like region .",
    "it is an expansion in terms of powers of @xmath9 and contains the condensates as expansion parameters . on the other hand , @xmath10 in ( [ eq : opehadr ] )",
    "is the same object for time - like momenta , represented by a parametrization in terms of hadronic variables .",
    "the dispersion integral connects time- and space - like momenta .",
    "( [ eq : opehadr ] ) connects the hadronic with the quark world .",
    "it allows to determine parameters in a hadronic parametrization of @xmath11 by comparing the lhs of this equation with its rhs . invoking vector meson dominance it is easy to see that for vector mesons im@xmath11 in ( [ eq : opehadr ] ) is just the spectral function of the meson under study .    the operator product expansion of @xmath8 on the lhs involves quark- and gluon condensates @xcite ; of these only the two - quark condensates",
    "are reasonably well known , whereas our knowledge about already the four - quark condensates is rather sketchy .    using the measured ,",
    "known vacuum spectral function for @xmath12 allows one to obtain information about these condensates appearing on the lhs of ( [ eq : opehadr ] ) . on the other hand , modelling the density - dependence of the condensates yields information on the change of the hadronic spectral function when the hadron is embedded in nuclear matter .",
    "since the spectral function appears under an integral the information obtained is not direct .",
    "therefore , as leupold et al .  have shown @xcite , the qcdsr provides important constraints for the hadronic spectral functions in medium , but it does not fix them .",
    "kaempfer et al have turned this argument around by pointing out that measuring an in - medium spectral function of the @xmath0 meson could help to determine the density dependence of the higher - order condensates @xcite .",
    "leupold has also argued that the four - quark condensates are interesting , because a special one of them can be unambiguously linked to a difference of spectral functions in the axial and vector channel @xcite .",
    "thus models are needed for the hadronic interactions .",
    "the quantitatively reliable ones can at present be based only on classical hadrons and their interactions . in lowest order in the density",
    "the mass and width of an interacting hadron in nuclear matter at zero temperature and vector density @xmath13 are given by ( for a meson , for example ) @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the forward scattering amplitude for a meson with energy @xmath16 on a nucleon .",
    "the width @xmath17 denotes the free decay width of the particle .",
    "for the imaginary part this is nothing other than the classical relation @xmath18 for the collision width , where @xmath4 is the total cross section .",
    "this can easily be seen by using the optical theorem .",
    "the calculation of hadronic spectral functions in medium thus reduces  in lowest order in the density  to a calculation of hadron - nucleon scattering amplitudes .",
    "unfortunately it is not a - priori known up to which densities the low - density expansion ( [ trho ] ) is useful .",
    "post et al .",
    "@xcite have recently investigated this question in a coupled - channel calculation of selfenergies .",
    "their analysis comprises pions , @xmath19-mesons and @xmath3-mesons as well as all baryon resonances with a sizeable coupling to any of these mesons .",
    "the authors of @xcite find that already for densities less than @xmath20 the linear scaling of the selfenergies inherent in ( [ trho ] ) is badly violated for the @xmath3 and the @xmath21 mesons , whereas it is a reasonable approximation for the @xmath19 meson .",
    "this may serve as a warning sign for many in - medium calculations that use the low - density approximation without any further proof of its reliability .",
    "reasons for this deviation from linearity are fermi - motion , pauli - blocking , selfconsistency and short - range correlations .",
    "for different mesons different sources of the discrepancy prevail : for the @xmath3 and @xmath19 mesons the selfconsistency acts against the low - density theorem by inducing a strong broadening for the @xmath22 and a slightly repulsive mass shift for the @xmath23 nucleon resonances to which the @xmath3 and the @xmath19 meson , respectively , couple .",
    "the investigation of in - medium properties of mesons , for example , thus involves at the same time the study of in - medium properties of nucleon resonances and is therefore a coupled - channel problem .    the strong interplay between the @xmath3 meson and the d13(1520)-nucleon hole excitation leads to a dominant lower hump in the @xmath3 spectral function also in this relativistic and selfconsistent calculation ; it confirms our earlier result obtained in a more simplified approach .",
    "whereas the longitudinal component of the @xmath3 meson only broadens somewhat , the transverse component shows a major distortion which evolves as a function of the @xmath3 momentum ( see fig .",
    "[ rhospect ] ) and reflects the coupling to the d13(1520 ) resonance .",
    "it is obvious that such a rich structure can not be obtained from qcd sumrules that involve only an integral over the spectral function . at the same time , the d13(1520 ) resonance broadens considerably due to the opening of phase - space for @xmath3-decay . for the @xmath19 meson the optical potential resulting from our model is rather attractive whereas the in - medium modifications of the s11(1535 ) are found to be quite small .      besides the range of validity of the low - density approximation",
    "the meson - nucleon cross sections are often not directly measurable and can be inferred only from unitarity arguments involving many coupled channels .",
    "unitarity thus provides important contraints for reactions such as @xmath24 that are experimentally not accessible , but are not only needed for but contribute significantly to a calculation of the @xmath0 selfenergy .",
    "bearing this in mind we have recently performed a calculation of the selfenergy of the @xmath0 meson in medium .",
    "this calculation is based on a unitary coupled channel analysis of all existing @xmath25 and @xmath26 data up to an invariant mass of 2 gev @xcite .",
    "the coupled channel character of this calculation is of utmost importance here because it is the only way to include experimental constraints on the @xmath2 decay channel that was found to be dominant in @xcite .",
    "this analysis and thus also the selfenergy of the @xmath0 meson extracted from the @xmath27 scattering amplitude gives a broadening of about 60 mev at @xmath28 for an @xmath0 at rest and a small upward shift of the peak mass .",
    "in addition , due to a nonzero coupling of the @xmath0 to the s11(1535 ) resonance the @xmath0 spectral function exhibits a small peak at a mass of around 550 mev .",
    "this calculation gives , for the first time , the @xmath0 selfenergy also for nonzero momenta ( which corresponds to the experimental situation ) . the result of this calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ omspectr ] .    for vanishing @xmath0 momentum",
    "this result qualitatively agrees with that of @xcite in that it yields a lower mass structure in the spectral function at an invariant mass of 500 - 600 mev and only a very small shift of the main peak ; the latter is in contrast to the results of @xcite ( for a recent discussion of the results obtained in @xcite see @xcite ) and of @xcite .",
    "the latter was based on a relativistic mean - field model and does not contain any dispersive effects .",
    "[ omspectr ] also shows clearly that the @xmath0 meson in medium acquires a significant broadening , caused by collisions with the surrounding nucleons .",
    "our second line of approach to the problem of in - medium selfenergies has concentrated on an analysis of the recent cb / taps@elsa data @xcite since the experiment looks for the channel @xmath29 it is mandatory to control the effects of final state interactions on the @xmath30 in a quantitative way .",
    "the only method available for this is that of coupled channel semiclassical transport calculations which  as we had shown earlier in extensive work  can give a consistent description of many experimental phenomena , both in heavy - ion @xcite as well as in nucleon- , pion- @xcite , photon- @xcite and neutrino - induced reactions @xcite . for any reaction on nuclei with hadrons in the final state a state - of - the - art transport calculation of the final state interactions is an indispensible part of the theory .",
    "we have , therefore , spent significant effort on developing a new code , dubbed gibuu , for the transport calculations .",
    "this code is written in object - oriented fortran 95/2003 and incorporates all the experience we have gained with earlier numerical implementations at giessen over the last 20 years @xcite .",
    "a major effort has gone into an analysis of the @xmath0 photo - production experiment at cb / taps@elsa .    for @xmath0 mesons",
    "the cb / taps@elsa collaboration has measured the nuclear transparency @xcite , see fig .",
    "this transparency gives directly the imaginary part of the meson s selfenergy in medium ; using a low - density approximation one can then extract the inelastic @xmath27 cross section .",
    "the figure shows an analysis of these data for various values of the collisional width , assumed at a momentum of 1.1 gev , the average momentum of the @xmath0 mesons in this experiment .",
    "again , care has been taken to ensure consistency between the collisional width and the inelastic @xmath27 cross sections .",
    "it is seen from this figure that a width of about 130 - 150 mev describes the data .",
    "this width is larger by about a factor of 3 than that previously assumed .",
    "a fit to the data can actually also determine the momentum - dependence of this cross section @xcite .",
    "with this method we have also analysed results on the experimental determination of the nuclear transparency ratio for @xmath31 mesons @xcite , measured by a group at spring8 .",
    "also in this case an unexpectedly large inelastic cross section for @xmath32 interactions was extracted .",
    "we have found that indeed cross sections about a factor 3 larger than those theoretically expected are needed to explain the mentioned data , in line with a simple glauber analysis by the spring8 group .",
    "our simulations give a full event analysis and thus allow to calculate also background contributions on the same footing as the actual signal .",
    "they also allow insight into the effects of rescattering of the pions produced in the decay of the @xmath0 meson and have suggested a method to suppress the rescattered pion background that has actually been adopted by the experimental group .",
    "the result of this analysis is that the @xmath0 spectral function published by the cb / taps@elsa collaboration can be explained only if a lowering of the @xmath0 meson mass in medium by about 16 % is assumed together with the appropriate collisional broadening .",
    "a problem in this context is that the experiment does not determine the spectral function of the @xmath0 meson itself .",
    "instead , we have noted that the result of the experimental analysis is the product of the primary production cross section with the spectral function and the partial decay probability into the channel under study ( @xmath33 here ) . if the first and the latter depend strongly on the invariant mass itself , as it does for the cb / taps@elsa experiment , then significant distortions of the spectral function may arise .",
    "this is a topic that is presently under intensive study @xcite .",
    "since the restoration of chiral symmetry should lead to a convergence of scalar - isoscalar and scalar - isovector strength at high densities it was predicted that the decay of the scalar @xmath4 meson into two uncharged pions should become increasingly difficult and the scalar strength should become narrower at the @xmath2 threshold @xcite .",
    "the taps collaboration had indeed initially seen this effect in the @xmath34 data as predicted , whereas a comparison measurement in the @xmath35 channel did not show such an effect @xcite .",
    "various explanations for these findings have been advanced by the valencia group @xcite and by a group in lyon @xcite in terms of @xmath36 correlations or chiral symmetry restoration in nuclei .",
    "none of these calculations , however , did look into the simplest possible explanation of the observed effects in terms of mundane pion rescattering .",
    "we have , therefore , performed such calculations @xcite using the gibuu method which is ideally suited for this task .",
    "these calculations , which did not contain any effects connected with @xmath37 correlations , did reproduce the observed effect for the @xmath38 channel , but they also predicted a similar effect in the semi - charged channel where it had not been seen experimentally . however , a more recent analysis with higher statistics by bloch et al . @xcite yielded a result for both charge channels that is in perfect agreement with our calculations ( see fig .",
    "[ 2pi ] ; the dashed lines in this figure are normalized in height to the data , this normalization reflects uncertainties in the elementary cross sections ) .",
    "in particular the yield in the semi - charged channel is strongly influenced by a coupled - channel effect , the charge transfer in @xmath25 interactions ; glauber based absorption models miss this contribution .",
    "this illustrates that a very sophisticated treatment of final state interactions is absolutely mandatory when looking for more exotic effects in nuclei .",
    "we conclude that any analysis of the @xmath34 data with respect to a lowering of the scalar strength in nuclei has to take the pion rescattering effects into account .",
    "present day s data are all consistent with simple rescattering .",
    "the main message we have learned from the studies reported here is that it is important to calculate not only in - medium properties under idealized conditions ( static , uniform matter in equilibrium ) , but to also explore the influence of these properties on actual observables .",
    "the spectral function itself , which contains the information on in - medium selfenergies , in particular in - medium masses and widths , is not directly observable . instead",
    ", both the creation of the studied hadron as well as its decay influence the observables as much as the spectral function itself and thus have to be under good control .",
    "the same holds for the final state interactions on hadronic decay products . here",
    "a state - of - the - art treatment of final state interactions is mandatory .",
    "there is now general agreement on the amount of collisional broadening of vector mesons in medium , but the verification of an actual mass - shift still requires more work , both theoretical and experimental . until then the quest for chiral symmetry restoration in nuclei remains a challenging topic .",
    "this talk is mainly based on results obtained by oliver buss and pascal muehlich as part of their doctoral theses .",
    "i thank them , and the entire gibuu group , for many inspiring discussions .",
