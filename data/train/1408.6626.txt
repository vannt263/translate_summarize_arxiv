    "the slow wave structures investigated so far are : single or double dielectric slab in the planar geometry , and cylindrical waveguide lined with a dielectric material .",
    "_ @xcite made one of the earlier theoretical analysis for the small - signal gain in cfel and compared with the gain of conventional undulator based fel .",
    "they used linearized vlasov equation to evaluate the modulation in the current density due to interaction with the electromagnetic field .",
    "the modulated current density was then used to calculate the energy gain of the cfel . in their analysis",
    ", they neglected the space charge effect and performed the calculations only in the low - gain regime .",
    "the analysis was further extended by several authors @xcite by setting up the coupled maxwell - vlasov equations , and the growth rate was calculated . in most of the earlier analyses ,",
    "the electron motion was assumed to be one dimensional in the presence of strong external static magnetic field @xcite .",
    "freund and ganguly @xcite developed a three - dimensional ( 3d ) theory for the cfel in the cylindrical configuration , by setting up coupled maxwell - lorentz equations to evolve the electromagnetic field and the electron trajectories .",

    "the dispersion relation can be expanded in the taylor series about the roots of no - beam dispersion to find the growth rate of electromagnetic field . using this approach , owens and brownell @xcite performed two - dimensional ( 2d ) analysis for a cfel based on single slab geometry . assuming an infinite electron beam",

    "andrew and brau @xcite developed a 3d theory for the device and found that the gain reduces by an order of magnitude as compared to the 2d theory .",
    "the usual cubic dispersion relation gets replaced by the 5/2-power dispersion relation on accounts of 3d effects .",

    "_ @xcite and corresponding asymmetric case has been studied by sharma and mishra @xcite .",
    "this approach works well in the linear regime , but is difficult to extend in the non - linear regime .",
    "recently , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors have discussed an approach based on maxwell - lorentz equations for the analysis of @xmath0erenkov fels , which is similar to that of conventional fels .",
    "asgekar and dattoli @xcite have used this approach to calculate the gain and saturation intensity in the @xmath0erenkov fels , for the single slab geometry . in their analysis",
    ", they have however not included the variation of the electromagnetic fields in a direction perpendicular to the dielectric surface in a rigorous way , while solving the coupled maxwell - lorentz equations .",
    "in particular , they have not calculated the power in the electromagnetic field taking the transverse variation of the field into account . as a result ,",
    "the formulae derived in these references do not have dependence on the height of the electron beam from the dielectric surface .    in all the above mentioned analyses , size of the electron beam",
    "is taken to be either very large or infinite .",
    "since the mode supported by the dielectric surface is evanescent in the direction perpendicular to the surface and confined in a region very close to the dielectric surface , it is more appropriate to take a flat electron beam travelling very close to the dielectric surface to ensure significant interaction with the evanescent mode .",
    "we would like to emphasize that a flat beam has vertical size much smaller than its horizontal size over the entire interaction length .",
    "the first experimental observation of the @xmath0erenkov radiation by using flat electron beam was performed by danos _",
    "et al . _ in 1953 @xcite . in comparison to a round electron beam ,",
    "flat beam with the same current allows more effective interaction with the surface mode , since all the electrons are at a reduced height from the dielectric surface .",
    "also , a flat beam can allow much more current within the required dimension in the horizontal direction , and thus will help to enhance the output power of the device @xcite .",

    "our approach incorporates the space charge effects , and it is easily extendible to the non - linear regime , unlike the approach based on coupled maxwell - vlasov equations . in this approach , the electromagnetic field due to a flat beam is presented as a spectrum of plane waves of different frequencies and having phase velocity equal to the electron beam velocity @xcite .",
    "these waves are evanescent in nature and decay , away from the electron beam .",
    "when the electron beam is kept sufficiently close to the dielectric medium , these evanescent waves are incident on the surface and give rise to reflected evanescent waves .",
    "sum of the incident and reflected electromagnetic field effectively interacts with the co - propagating electron beam and gives rise to the coherent electromagnetic radiation , under suitable condition .",
    "the evaluation of reflectivity for a dielectric slab supported by an ideal conductor is easily done by satisfying the appropriate boundary conditions . for a given phase velocity of the evanescent wave ,",
    "the reflection coefficient has a singularity at a particular frequency , which means that the structure supports a surface mode at that frequency @xcite .",
    "the interaction of the electron beam with this surface mode becomes the mechanism for the working of @xmath0erenkov fel . by evaluating the dispersion relation for normal materials",
    ", we can see that the group velocity of surface mode in a cfel is always positive",
    ". however , in case of negative - index material , the energy flows in backward direction @xcite . for this case , under certain conditions , the system develops a self feedback mechanism and can act like a backward wave oscillator ( bwo ) .",
    "the device based on positive index materials will always have a travelling wave amplifier ( twa)-type interaction @xcite .",

    ", we set up the basic electromagnetic field equations for a single - slab geometry based cfel driven by a flat electron beam .",
    "this is followed by the detailed calculation of singularity in the reflection coefficient of the dielectric surface .",
    "next , we discuss the interaction of the surface mode with the electron beam and calculate the small - signal gain in section iii . in sec .",

    "( 23)-(26 ) at @xmath165 .",
    "this scheme is repeated step by step , and we ensure that the energy conservation [ eq .",
    "( a1 ) ] is satisfied in each step of integration .",
    "we now discuss the results of our numerical simulations .",
    "the parameters used in the code are listed in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "figure 5 shows the gain as a function of initial electric field .",
    "we obtain the small - gain of about 20 @xmath130 .",
    "this value of small - signal gain is consistent with our analytical calculations .",
    "the gain decreases with the magnitude of electric field and finally saturates .",
    "@xmath0erenkov fel is a low gain system for the chosen parameters .",
    "hence , in order to get an appreciable output power , we need to operate the device in the oscillator configuration .",
    "we propose that a set of mirrors may be used to form a resonator for the oscillator configuration .",
    "one mirror is assumed to have 100 @xmath130 reflectivity , while the second mirror is having the reflectivity of field amplitude as 98 @xmath130 . in this configuration ,",
    "the electromagnetic field reflected at the end of one pass becomes input field for the next pass .",
    "we examined the non - linear solution of the maxwell - lorentz equations by performing numerical simulation in multi - pass operation .",
    "figure  6 shows the growth in the power of the surface mode with the number of passes .",
    "the power builds up slowly in this low - gain system , and saturates after 250 passes .",
    "the output optical power per unit mode width after saturation is obtained as 7.9 w / m .",
    "the input power per unit width of the electron beam is about 1 kw / m . this gives us efficiency of about 0.8 @xmath130 at saturation .",
    "as discussed by walsh and murphy @xcite , the upper bound of the efficiency for power conversion in a cfel can be written as : @xmath166 we get an upper bound of 1.4 @xmath130 for the efficiency of a @xmath0erenkov fel .",
    "this is in well agreement with the results of numerical simulations as the analytic expression is only a rough estimate for the maximum value of efficiency .",
    "we also examined the evaluation in the phase space distribution of the electrons along the interaction region .",
    "figure 7(a ) shows amplitude of bunching parameter @xmath167 along the distance after the saturation of output power .",
    "we observed that the electrons are nicely bunched at the exit of the interaction region and the amplitude of bunching parameter is about 0.7 .",
    "similar mechanism is observed in the plot of phase space distribution of electrons at the entrance and at the exit of the interaction region .",
    "we clearly see in the fig .",
    "7(b ) that the electrons are randomly distributed at the entrance , and become bunched at the end due to the interaction with the co - propagating surface mode .",
    "in this paper , we have presented an analysis of @xmath0erenkov fel driven by a flat electron beam for the single slab geometry , by setting up maxwell - lorentz equations . for conventional undulator",
    "based fels , the approach based on maxwell - lorentz equations has been extremely successful , particularly to understand the behaviour in the non - linear regime , and to incorporate realistic effects .",
    "however , most of the analyses of cfel in slab geometry so far have used either the mazwell - vlasov equation approach , or the hydrodynamic approach , which are useful in the linear regime .",
    "there has been earlier attempt to analyze the cfel system for slab geometry based on maxwell - lorentz equations in refs .",
    "however , the evanescent nature of the surface mode has not been included in these analyses in a rigorous way , while setting up the coupled maxwell - lorentz equations . as a result",
    ", these analyses do not describe the dependency on the height of electron beam from the dielectric surface properly , and also do not describe the case of flat beam appropriately since the volume current density becomes very large . in our analysis",
    ", we have included the evanescent nature of the surface mode in a rigorous way , and also included the effect of space charge by taking into account the field due to incident and reflected evanescent wave .    in our analysis",
    ", we have not considered the effects due to energy spread , beam emittance and three dimensional variations of the optical field . since the maxwell - lorentz based approach that we have developed in this paper is identical to the approach developed for spfel @xcite and conventional fel @xcite , we can add these effects by similar way , which we propose to do in the future .",
    "our analysis is build up on the earlier analysis of smith - purcell fel , where the parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 obtained from the laurent expansion of reflectivity of the system around the singularity were used for setting up of maxwell - lorentz equations . in the analysis presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the expression for power in the surface mode was obtained by applying energy conservation in the coupled maxwell - lorentz equations . for the case of sp - fel ,",
    "it is not possible to derive a simple expression for power in the surface mode by integration of poynting vector since reflection grating is a complex electromagnetic system .",
    "thus , the power calculation in terms of @xmath67 parameter derived using energy conservation approach could not be cross checked with the expression derived by integration of poynting vector . on the other hand , for the analysis of cfel system presented in this paper , it has been possible to derive an analytical expression for the power by integrating the poynting vector since dielectric is a much simpler system compared to a reflection grating , which has infinite number of space harmonics in the expression for electromagnetic field .",
    "we have thus been able to check that for the general framework of setting up of maxwell - lorentz equations in terms of the @xmath67 parameter , the expression for power flow is calculated correctly .",
    "another interesting observation is that unlike sp - fel system , here we have been able to derive analytical expressions for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which can be calculated only numerically for the sp - fel case .",
    "we have considered the parameters used in the dartmouth experiment @xcite to perform calculations .",
    "the output power reported in the dartmouth experiment @xcite was of the order of picowatt and growth rate was predicted around 250 - 450 per m. to get an appreciable output power , authors in ref .",
    "@xcite suggested the use of the flat electron beam to drive the cfel .",
    "we performed the analysis with flat electron beam and obtained the output power of around 240 mw with an efficiency of about 0.8 @xmath130 at saturation in the oscillator configuration .",
    "outcoupling of thz radiation can be done by putting a hole in the outcoupling mirror and the radiation power can be directed to the useful experiments . in this way , @xmath0erenkov fels can fulfil the requirements of several industrial and scientific applications which require copious coherent thz radiation .",
    "we would like to mention that the formula for @xmath67 and @xmath68 that we have described in this paper can be used for the case of negative index material also , and our analysis can be extended to understand the behaviour of cfel in bwo configuration which is described in ref . @xcite .",
    "also , the analysis can be extended for the case of finite thickness of the electron beam in the @xmath16-direction .",
    "this can be done by treating the beam as combination of continuous layers of flat beam .    to conclude",
    ", we have presented an analysis for the working of cfel by studying the singularity in the reflectivity of the dielectric slab .",
    "we have set up the coupled maxwell - lorentz equations , taking into the evanescent nature of surface mode and also the space charge field .",
    "this approach is suitable for writing computer program for analysis of the cfel system taking realistic effects such as energy spread , beam emittance , etc . into account , and also to analyze the nonlinear behaviour of the system . for conventional fel @xcite and spfel @xcite ,",
    "this approach has already been very successful , and by extending this approach to @xmath0erenkov fels , we have stepped forward towards having a unified theory for all fels .",
    "our analysis can be useful for the design and the operation of a compact @xmath0erenkov fel working in the thz regime .",
    "in this appendix , we derive the expression for power in the surface mode by using the energy conservation in the coupled maxwell - lorentz equations .",
    "this approach has been discussed in detail for the sp - fels @xcite . here , we are summarizing the results for @xmath0erenkov fels . in steady state , the set of eqs .",
    "( 23)-(26 ) can be combined to obtain the following expression : @xmath168 it indicates that the energy lost by the electron beam while travelling down the interaction region , appears in the surface modes .",
    "this is the principle of conservation of energy . using eq .",
    "( a1 ) , we can express the energy lost per unit time by the electron beam and equate it to the power developed in the surface mode . by doing the required algebra in this way",
    ", we obtain the following expression of the power in the surface mode : @xmath132 this expression is used to calculate the power in our numerical simulations .",
    "next , we drive the expression for the total energy stored in the electromagnetic fields . the energy stored in the fields can be evaluated by integrating the energy density @xmath176=@xmath177 over the volume of the required region .",
    "total energy stored in electromagnetic fields is sum of energy in vacuum and in the dielectric medium , which we obtain as : @xmath178\\epsilon_0 ce^2e^{2\\gamma h}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by knowing the expression for the power @xmath179 and the energy stored @xmath180 , one can find the energy velocity as @xmath181=@xmath182 . using eq .",
