    "in chapter 1 , the model of a standard accretion disk around a rotating black hole is presented with general relativity effects rigorously taken into account .",
    "this model was first described in paper @xcite and since then has been used in many studies to obtain a convincing evidence of the existence of black holes in both stellar binary systems and active galactic nuclei .",
    "it remains topical because a full account for general relativistic properties of matter motion in the disk and generation of its emission allows the position of the inner disk radius and hence the black hole spin to be inferred from observations .",
    "observational appearances of relativistic disks were modeled for the first time in @xcite ( see @xcite , @xcite for comprehensive reviews , references therein and their citations list ) .",
    "in addition , the standard accretion disk underlies more complicated theories of warped ( twisted ) accretion disks which are formed when the accreting matter moves outside the equatorial plane of a rotating black hole .",
    "such a theory is presented in @xcite and is discussed in more detail in chapter 2 .",
    "everywhere below , the natural units @xmath0 are used .",
    "if the mass is measured in units of the black hole mass , @xmath1 , the unit of length is half of the schwarzschild gravitational radius , @xmath2 , such that @xmath3 and the unit of time is the light crossing time of the unit of length .",
    "in addition , latin indices @xmath4 taking values from 0 to 3 are used to denote components of vectors , with the zero component standing for the time coordinate .",
    "also , wherever needed the einstein summation convention is used .",
    "properties of spacetime near a rotating black hole are described by axially symmetric and stationary metric of the form ( see , e.g. , @xcite , paragraph 4.2 ) :    @xmath5    where the signature @xmath6 is chosen and the coefficients are @xmath7 @xmath8 the coordinates @xmath9 are called the boyer - lindquist coordinates . far away from the gravitating body ,",
    "the spatial part of these coordinates in the limit of the zero black hole spin parameter , @xmath10 , transits into the usual spherical coordinates , where @xmath11 is the azimuthal angle . for non - zero @xmath10 ,",
    "it transits into generalized spherical coordinates in which the surfaces of constant radial distance , @xmath12 , represent spheroids with the aspect ratio @xmath13 .",
    "the space - time described by ( [ kerr ] ) , is axially symmetric with respect to the line @xmath14 , called the black hole rotation axis ; the plane corresponding to @xmath15 , is called the black hole equatorial axis .    in ( [ kerr ] ) an important quantity appears : @xmath16 which has the dimension of frequency .",
    "this is the angular velocity that every freely moving observer , without exception , acquires in the direction of the black hole rotation .",
    "as is described in the literature on the structure of rotating black holes ( see , e.g. , @xcite , paragraph 58 ) , metric ( [ kerr ] ) has several special hypersurfaces , including the event horizon and the ergosphere .",
    "however , as we show below , for the astrophysical problem under consideration , of most importance is the dynamics of free circular motion of particles in the equatorial plane of the gravitating body .",
    "this motion has additional features in comparison to the corresponding newtonian problem .",
    "note also , that in chapter 2 weakly elliptical orbits slightly inclined to the equatorial plane are considered .",
    "we consider a standard , and hence geometrically thin , accretion disk .",
    "such a disk is basically flat . by definition , this is a stationary flow of matter with mirror symmetry with respect to its middle plane and axial symmetry with respect to the line perpendicular to this plane .",
    "clearly , such a model flow can be described by dynamical equations in axially symmetric metric only if the disk symmetry plane coincides with the equatorial plane of the black hole . to tackle the problem ,",
    "only the form of metric near the plane @xmath15 is sufficient . passing to cylindrical coordinates using the standard transformation @xmath17 all metric coefficients @xmath18 in ( [ kerr ] )",
    "can be expanded in a power series in small ratio @xmath19 . for geometrically thin disks ,",
    "the corrections to @xmath18 due to non - equatorial motion up to @xmath20 are sufficient .",
    "indeed , one of the basic equations describing the disk , namely , the projection of the relativistic analog of the euler equation onto the direction normal to the disk plane , must be odd with respect to the coordinate reflection @xmath21 due to the mirror symmetry of the disk .",
    "this means that in its series expansion in @xmath22 only odd powers of @xmath22 must be present . by the main assumption on the smallness of @xmath22 only the first term in this expansion",
    "should be kept .",
    "this , in turn , corresponds to series expansion of @xmath18 up to quadratic terms , since only first derivatives of @xmath18 , characterizing the strength of the gravitational field , enter dynamical equations .",
    "note , however , that hydrodynamic equations also contain a second covariant derivative of the velocity field ( see below ) , and hence the final expressions can involve second derivatives of @xmath18 with respect to @xmath23 , which may seem to require that we keep terms of the order of @xmath24 in @xmath18 .",
    "but this is not required , because , as follows from the explicit form of the stress - energy tensor , such terms can appear only when multiplied by some of the viscous coefficients , which in turn can not be greater than of the order of @xmath22 being proportional to the characteristic mixing length in the fluid .",
    "the latter is initially assumed to be less than the disk thickness .    as regards other equations , namely ( see below ) : two projections of the relativistic analog of the euler equation on to the disk plane , the energy balance equation and the rest energy conservation law  the same symmetry considerations imply that they are even under the coordinate reflection @xmath21 ; therefore , the leading term is of the zeroth order in @xmath22 in the metric expansion .    using these expansions and expressions for the coordinate differentials , @xmath25 @xmath26 we find the metric in the following form ( see also @xcite ) :    @xmath27 dt^2 -   \\left [ r^2 + a^2 + \\frac{2a^2}{r } - \\frac{a^2 z^2}{r^2}\\left ( 1 + \\frac{5}{r } + \\frac{2a^2}{r^3 } \\right ) \\right ] d\\phi^2 + \\\\ \\frac{2a}{r } \\left [ 2 - \\frac{z^2}{r^2 } \\left ( 3 + \\frac{2a^2}{r^2}\\right ) \\right ] d t d\\phi - \\\\ \\left \\ { 1 - \\frac{z^2}{r^2 d } \\left [ \\frac{3}{r } - \\frac{4}{r^2 } - \\frac{a^2}{r^2 }   \\left ( 3 - \\frac{6}{r } + \\frac{2a^2}{r^2 } \\right ) \\right ] \\right \\ } \\frac{dr^2}{d } -   \\frac{2 z}{r d } \\left ( \\frac{2}{r } - \\frac{a^2}{r^2 } \\right ) dr dz - \\\\ \\left [ 1 + \\frac{z^2}{r^2 d } \\left ( \\frac{2}{r } - \\frac{2a^2}{r^3 } + \\frac{a^4}{r^4 } \\right ) \\right ] dz^2,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    where the notation    @xmath28 is introduced .",
    "below , we also use ( with a few exceptions ) the notations introduced in the original paper by novikov and thorne @xcite for the relativistic correction coefficients .    finally , the inverse of the matrix @xmath29 corresponding to double - contravariant tensor has the form : @xmath30      the expression for circular equatorial geodesics can be conveniently found from the extremum condition for the distance along them .",
    "here we follow the exposition from @xcite , ( see paragraphs 13.10 and 13.13 ) . indeed , for time - like trajectories the functional    @xmath31 should be minimal , which is equivalent to the euler - lagrange equations for @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the four - velocity in the boyer - lindquist coordinates . as @xmath32 does not explicitly depend on @xmath35 and @xmath11 ,",
    "the following quantities are conserved : @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 have the meaning of the time and azimuthal covariant velocity components , respectively .    in explicit form , using the components @xmath18 from ( [ kerr_rz ] ) at @xmath40 , we find : @xmath41 @xmath42",
    "we temporarily assume that the motion is not necessarily circular and @xmath43 . instead of the @xmath44-component of the euler - lagrange equations , it is more convenient to use the condition of the normalization of the four - velocity of particles with non - zero mass : @xmath45 this yields the following equation for @xmath38 and @xmath39 : @xmath46 where we introduce the effective potential @xmath47    the conditions for circular motion include , first , @xmath48 and , second , @xmath49 ( for the particle to stay in a circular orbit ) .",
    "the latter condition is equivalent to the vanishing of the derivative of @xmath50 with respect to @xmath44 : @xmath51    equation ( [ geod_norm ] ) with @xmath48 and equation ( [ geod_norm1 ] ) allow us to determine @xmath38 and @xmath39 as functions of @xmath44 and then , using ( [ geod_t ] ) and ( [ geod_phi ] ) , to find @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    to solve the first problem ,",
    "let us introduce the new variable @xmath54 and , to facilitate manipulations , make the change @xmath55 . then equation ( [ geod_norm ] ) taken with @xmath48 and equation ( [ geod_norm1 ] ) yield the following equation for @xmath56 : @xmath57 \\mu^4 - 2u [ ( 3u-1)(a^2 u-1 ) -2u a^2 ( u-1 ) ] \\mu^2 + ( au-1)^2 = 0.\\ ] ]    the solution of ( [ mu ] ) for a stable circular prograde orbit has the form : @xmath58^{1/2}}.\\ ] ]    using ( [ mu_sol ] ) and ( [ geod_norm ] ) taken at @xmath48 , we find the constants @xmath39 and @xmath38 , as well as the components @xmath59 : @xmath60 where @xmath61    it is easy to check that modulus of this vector is equal to unity : @xmath62    the angular velocity measured by the clock of an infinite observer ( who measures the coordinate time @xmath35 ) , corresponding to such a motion , is @xmath63 it follows that in the schwarzschild case this value exactly coincides with the keplerian angular velocity .",
    "this is determined by the condition that the stable circular motion is no longer possible when the minimum of the function @xmath64 disappears at @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the radius of a circular orbit .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition @xmath67 which leads to the quartic equation @xmath68 where @xmath69 .    using the ferrari method ( see , e.g. ,",
    "@xcite ) , we write the corresponding auxiliary cubic equation : @xmath70 the real root of equation ( [ eq_r_ms_cub ] ) is related to the cardano solution to the corresponding incomplete cubic equation and is given by @xmath71 + 4.\\ ] ]    next , having @xmath72 , it is possible to use the ferrari solution to write the quadratic equation that gives two real roots of ( [ eq_r_ms ] ) : @xmath73 the larger root of ( [ quadr_eq ] ) , @xmath74 , determines the boundary of the stable circular motion of test particles in the equatorial plane , which we denote as @xmath75 .",
    "thus , @xmath76 it is easy to check that the result ( [ r_ms ] ) coincides with the expression presented in @xcite , ( see formula ( 15k ) therein ) , taking into account that the auxiliary values @xmath77 in @xcite take the form @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 in our notation .    in the case of the schwarzschild metric , @xmath81 , we recover the well - known result that the circular motion becomes unstable for @xmath82 , i.e. at distances smaller than three gravitational radii from the black hole . for slow rotation , @xmath83",
    ", we have @xmath84 , and hence the zone of stable motion shifts closer towards the event horizon . in the limit case",
    "@xmath85 we find @xmath86 , i.e. the marginally stable circular orbit coincides with the gravitational radius of the extreme - spin black hole .    during accretion , gas elements in the disk slowly approach @xmath87 by loosing their angular momentum due to the action of viscous forces .",
    "once the gas elements fall into the region with @xmath88 , due to instability of the circular motion they need not lose the angular momentum any more to approach the black hole .",
    "this means that the matter falls freely inside @xmath87 , and the standard accretion disk model assumes that @xmath87 is the inner disk radius .",
    "mechanical laws , formulated in the form of vector equations , can be written in the symbolic form irrespective to any observer or any reference frame . but to represent some physical quantity describing a natural phenomenon in the form of a set of numerical values , the measurement procedure should be specified . in newtonian mechanics , this means that the observer introduces a coordinate system , and then at each point of space he / she arbitrarily constructs three basis vectors .",
    "the coordinate system and the basis vectors can evolve in time , which is the same at all points .",
    "a tool measuring time , together with the coordinate grid and a vector basis , form a reference frame , in which any physical value ( scalar , vector or tensor ) can be measured , i.e. it can be represented by a number or a set of numbers .",
    "the situation in relativistic mechanics is different : because it is not possible to consider the time independently , it becomes the fourth component of the space - time continuum .",
    "therefore , the choice of the reference frame reduces to the construction of a coordinate system and four basis vectors determined at each point of space - time . in general , this",
    "set of basis vectors is usually referred to as a tetrad .",
    "there is no a universal observer any more ; instead , a set of observers moving along a certain family of world lines is considered .",
    "if one of the tetrad orts , conventionally corresponding to the time direction , is tangent at each point to these world lines , the tetrad is said to be transported by the observers .",
    "the last statement can be easily understood , because in such a basis , the four - velocity of each observer at any time has a non - zero projection only on the time ort , in other words , the observers are at rest in this basis , i.e. transport it with them .    [",
    "[ coordinate - representation ] ] coordinate representation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    thus , the choice of the coordinate system and the choice of the tetrad are independent procedures .",
    "nevertheless , if there is a coordinate system , @xmath89 , the tetrad is frequently chosen in such a way that each basis vector , @xmath90 , is tangent to the corresponding coordinate line . here",
    "the moduli of orts of these so - called coordinate bases are chosen such that their pairwise scalar products are equal to the corresponding metric coefficients : @xmath91    we recall that in differential geometry ( see paragraphs 3.1 - 3.4 @xcite ) , such coordinate orts are introduced as objects isomorphic to the partial derivatives of an arbitrary scalar function on the manifold with respect to the coordinates , @xmath92    any ( tangent ) vector is a linear combination of the coordinate orts , and the components of this linear combination are called contravariant components of the vector .",
    "in addition to @xmath93 the so - called dual basis , @xmath94 , is introduced with the orts defined as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the kronecker symbol .",
    "the condition ( [ duality ] ) implies that each ort of the dual basis has unit projection on the corresponding ort of the coordinate basis and is orthogonal to all other orts of the coordinate basis .",
    "the dual coordinate orts , in turn , are introduced as objects isomorphic to the coordinate differentials , @xmath97    next , if we use the fact that any tangent vector @xmath98 can be alternatively presented as a linear combination of dual coordinate orts , whose coefficients are referred to as covariant vector components , we obtain the well - known rule of lowering vector indices :    @xmath99    in a similar way it is easy to show that if we introduce the notation @xmath100 , then due to the duality of bases , the matrix @xmath29 is inverse to the matrix @xmath18 , and the rule of raising of vector indices holds .",
    "similar representation in coordinate bases can be extended to a more general case of tensors .",
    "[ [ tetrad - representation ] ] tetrad representation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this and subsequent sections we mostly follow the exposition given in paragraph 7 of @xcite .",
    "assume that now we want to project the same vectors and tensors on an arbitrary tetrad defined by relations @xmath101 where @xmath102 are some functions of coordinates , and the indices labeling the tetrad orts are in parentheses .    from the duality condition ( [ duality ] )",
    "we can introduce the dual tetrad : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the matrix inverse to @xmath102 .",
    "in these matrices , there are two kinds of indices : coordinate and tetrad ones .",
    "the coordinate indices can be lowered or raised using the metric ( [ kerr ] ) .",
    "we can impose an additional constraint on the tetrad : @xmath105 where @xmath106 are mutually inverse matrices and @xmath107 is the minkowski matrix . in other words , we require that the original and dual tetrads be orthonormal in four - dimensional pseudo - euclidean space .    using above relations , it is straightforward to show that @xmath108 and therefore the following alternative expression for the interval squared holds : @xmath109 which is useful below .",
    "note that the values in parentheses in the right - hand side of ( [ kerr_tetr ] ) can be considered as infinitesimal shifts along the corresponding orts of the tetrad ; therefore , in the introduced tetrad representation with an orthonormal tetrad , the square of interval takes exactly the form as in the minkowski space - time of special relativity .",
    "similarly , expressions ( [ tetrade_gen ] ) can be thought of as directional derivatives along the tetrad s orts , and these have exactly the form that the usual partial derivatives with respect to coordinates in the coordinate basis take when changing from the coordinate basis to the tetrad one .",
    "using the definitions and relations given above , it is easy to see how the tetrad components of vectors are expressed through the coordinate components .",
    "tetrad components of a vector are written as @xmath110 conversely , @xmath111    similar expressions can be written for tensor of any valence .",
    "for example , for a two - covariant tensor , we have @xmath112 and conversely , @xmath113    note in conclusion that relations ( [ tetrade_vec ] ) and isomorphism ( [ tan_vect_dual ] ) can be used to find contravariant components of the four - velocity in the tetrad representation :    @xmath114    that is , it is again a unit tangent vector along the world line , but now its components are given by small shifts along the corresponding orts of the dual basis . using ( [ tetrade_vec ] )",
    "it is easy to find the relation between the conventional coordinate components of four - velocity , @xmath115 , and its tetrad components .",
    "covariant tetrad components are derived from contravariant ones using the standard rule in special relativity : lowering a spatial index is equivalent to changing the sign of the corresponding component .",

    "expression ( [ der_vec ] ) can be recast to the form : @xmath117 whence @xmath118 where @xmath119 are the so - called ricci rotation coefficients , @xmath120 an important point is that for orthonormal bases satisfying ( [ tetr_orth ] ) , the coefficients @xmath121 are antisymmetric in first two indices .",
    "indeed , @xmath122 comparing this relation with ( [ ricci ] ) proves the stated property of the ricci coefficients .",
    "finally , let us discuss one more useful property of coefficients ( [ ricci ] ) : to calculate these coefficients only partial derivatives of the components of the tetrad basis orts are needed , and therefore the christoffel symbols are not required .",
    "indeed , we consider auxiliary combinations @xmath123,\\ ] ] and rewrite them in the form @xmath124,\\ ] ] in the last expression , the ordinary partial derivatives can be substituted by covariant ones , because the additional terms with christoffel symbols are symmetric in @xmath125 . then expression ( [ lambdas2 ] ) is equal to the difference @xmath126 .",
    "but in such a case , @xmath127\\ ] ] and , using ( [ lambdas1 ] ) , it is possible to calculate the ricci rotation coefficients by taking partial derivatives of components of the tetrad basis orts .",
    "we now consider formula ( [ der_vec_2 ] ) .",
    "the left - hand side represents simply the projection on tetrad basis of a rank-2 covariant tensor obtained by taking the derivative of some vector field .",
    "therefore , this combination has meaning of the covariant derivative of a vector taken in a non - coordinate basis .",
    "next , the right - hand side of ( [ der_vec_2 ] ) has exactly the same form as the covariant derivative in a coordinate basis , with the only difference that it involves tetrad indices ( which can be raised or lowered , including for @xmath121 , using the minkowski metric ) .",
    "it can be shown that the same holds for contravariant components of a vector field and for tensor fields in general .",
    "thus , as the components of a covariant derivative in a tetrad basis has the same form as in a coordinate basis , it is convenient to use the same notations and terms that are used in the coordinate basis .",
    "in particular , the ricci rotation coefficients are simply referred to as the connection symbols in a given basis .",
    "we emphasize once again that they should not be confused with the christoffel symbols , which represent another limit case of connection coefficients in a coordinate basis and have different index symmetry .",
    "we construct a tetrad basis related at each point of space - time to observers moving around a black hole in equatorial circular orbits with angular velocity @xmath128 .",
    "strongly at @xmath40 this is the free motion along geodesics found in section [ sec_geod ] .",
    "however , for a small deviation from the equatorial plane , such a motion , corresponding to the constant @xmath23 , is possible only if there is some external supporting force ; in the case of a gas disk , for example , this force is due to the pressure gradient .",
    "to start the construction , we direct the time ort of the tetrad along the world line under discussion . using the four - vector of the geodesic found in section [ sec_geod ] ,",
    "write it in the form @xmath129 where we add the correction factor @xmath130 to the time coordinate component , since the modulus of the vector @xmath131 should be equal to unity away from the equatorial plane as well , whereas the vector @xmath132 itself is unitary only at @xmath40 . clearly , with account for this correction , @xmath131 would correspond to the four - velocity of the real motion .",
    "calculation of the modulus of the vector @xmath131 in metric ( [ kerr_rz ] ) shows that it is equal to unity under the following condition : @xmath133 where we introduce the relativistic correction coefficients @xmath134    @xmath135    thus , the ort @xmath131 is transported by the observer rotating around the black hole with a frequency equal to the @xmath11-component of @xmath131 , which is independent of @xmath23 .",
    "this frequency corresponds to the free circular motion in the equatorial plane of the black hole , and rotation occurs in planes of constant @xmath23 .",
    "we now calculate the time ort of the dual basis .",
    "according to the convention rule for raising and lowering coordinate indices , we have @xmath136    next , we consider the part of metric ( [ kerr_rz ] ) containing differentials @xmath137 and @xmath138 . it can be rewritten in the form ( see the result ( [ kerr_tetr ] ) in the previous section ) : @xmath139 ^ 2 - \\left [ { \\bf e}^{(z ) } \\right ] ^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath140 @xmath141 are the radial and vertical orts of the dual basis , respectively .",
    "the coordinate components of vectors @xmath142 and @xmath143 satisfy the orthonormality condition ( [ tetr_orth ] ) , as can be easily checked by direct substitution .",
    "the orthonormality condition for a tetrad can now be used to determine the fourth ort corresponding to the azimuthal direction .    from three orthonormality conditions for three already known vectors",
    ", we obtain that for these conditions to be consistent , the following relation should hold :    @xmath144 and the time and azimuthal components should be related as @xmath145    finally , the normalization condition for @xmath146 yields a quadratic equation for @xmath147 , and the sign of the solution is dictated by the additional requirement of the choice of a right - hand triple of space orts of the tetrad .",

    "in addition , the coefficient @xmath161 is equivalent to the coefficient @xmath162 introduced in @xcite .",
    "we also draw attention to the fact that two other coefficients , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , introduced in the same paper , are equivalent to our coefficients @xmath165 and @xmath162 , respectively .",
    "it can be checked that the original and dual bases presented in @xcite coincide with bases derived here at @xmath40 .    using formulas ( [ e_dual_1]-[e_dual_4 ] ) and ( [ tetr_vel ] ) , it is easy to deduce that solution ( [ geod_vel ] ) indeed yields @xmath166 in the equatorial plane .",

    "for the same reason , of the other coefficients , only half ( i.e. 24 ) have to be found .",
    "because we are interested in the region near the equatorial plane of the black hole , it makes sense to separate these coefficients into two groups : those that are @xmath167 in the leading order , and those that are proportional to the first power of @xmath22 . as mentioned in section [ sec_metric ] , the latter coefficients must appear in the vertical projection of the relativistic euler equation , while the former emerge in other equations .",

    "the counting shows that there must be 9 connection coefficients without the index @xmath168 , and hence an even function of @xmath23 , and 12 coefficients with the index @xmath168 and hence odd function of @xmath23 .",
    "the calculation indicates that only 4 coefficients of the first type are non - zero , namely :    @xmath184    @xmath185    to compute coefficients ( [ conn1],[conn2 ] ) it suffices to use bases taken without corrections in @xmath23 .",
    "when constructing the standard disk model , the following facts are also important .",
    "first , the direct calculation shows that another 5 connection coefficients of this type are zero through corrections of the order of @xmath186 inclusive .",
    "this is a rigorous result , since the coefficients @xmath121 under discussion have no derivatives of the basis components with respect to @xmath23 , and therefore the possible unaccounted for corrections due to terms @xmath187 in @xmath188 and @xmath189 can not contribute .",
    "second , direct calculation similarly shows that @xmath190 through the order @xmath191 .",
    "the calculation of all non - zero coefficients of the second type is much more cumbersome task .",
    "but as we will see below , the only coefficient of this type that is needed has the form",
    "@xmath192    we note that all connection coefficients of the type @xmath193 vanish in the equatorial plane @xmath40 .",
    "this is consistent with the requirement that the four - velocity @xmath166 must satisfy the geodesic equation at @xmath40 :    @xmath194      everywhere below , we only use the tetrad components of vectors , tensors and covariant derivatives . therefore ,",
    "starting from this section , we will substitute the tetrad notation by the standard one , which is familiar when using the coordinate basis .",
    "this means that from now on we do not put tetrad indices in parentheses and denote them by latin letters @xmath195 ; , appears among the indices , it means that the corresponding index takes this value . ] also , we denote the connection coefficients by @xmath196 .",
    "the stress - energy tensor of a viscous fluid with energy flux has the form ( see , e.g. , paragraph 4.3 in @xcite or paragraph 22.3 in @xcite ) @xmath197 where @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 are the rest - energy density , internal energy density , pressure and two viscosity coefficients , respectively , as measured in the local comoving fluid volume ; @xmath203 is the energy flux inside the fluid as measured by the local comoving observer .",

    ", we discuss basic assumptions of the model and their consequences .",
    "in addition to obvious assumptions about axial symmetry and stationarity of the flow ( meaning that the derivatives @xmath213 and @xmath214 are zero ) the main assumption , which we have already used , is the small disk thickness , @xmath215 , where @xmath216 is the characteristic height of the disk along the @xmath23-axis ( more precisely , the disk half - thickness ) .",
    "the disk symmetry with respect to the plane @xmath40 implies that @xmath217 are even functions of @xmath23 , and @xmath218 and @xmath219 are odd functions of @xmath23 .",
    "we also assume that the characteristic scale of variations of these quantities in the radial direction is much larger than that in the vertical direction , that is , their ratio is greater than @xmath220 , @xmath221 , should also be made that in vertical direction they can substantially change only on scales @xmath222 , otherwise , terms in the shear tensor could arise that strongly dynamically contribute to the vertical balance condition , which would lead to a disk totally different from the basic case of interest here . ] .",
    "next , kinematic arguments suggest that @xmath223 if the energy flux determined by vector @xmath203 is proportional to the internal energy gradient @xmath199 , then , for the local comoving observer , @xmath224 and @xmath225 . taking ( [ u_zr ] ) into account , implies that the projection of @xmath203 onto the four - velocity of circular equatorial motion is also small , i.e. of the order of @xmath226 . from the standard lorentz transformations ,",
    "we obtain that @xmath227 , i.e. the energy flux relative to the tetrad should be directed mostly normally to the disk plane .",
    "now , taking all the above into account , we consider the projection of the relativistic analog of euler equation ( [ euler ] ) onto the ort @xmath228 in more detail :    @xmath229    using the symmetry of physical quantities discussed above and symmetry properties of tetrad orts and connection coefficients ( which become odd functions of @xmath23 if they have at least one index @xmath23 ) , discussed in section [ sec_tetrad ] , it is easy to check that equation ( [ euler_z ] ) is indeed an odd function of @xmath23 .",
    "further , we see that the first term in ( [ euler_z ] ) separately yields the term @xmath230 and other terms containing @xmath200 are smaller due to the smallness of @xmath218 .",
    "all other terms together can always be written as @xmath231 with the function @xmath232 .",
    "thus , we arrive at the important conclusion that necessarily @xmath233    this means that in a thin disk the variables @xmath234 , i.e. these variables are small relative to the dominant action of the gravitational force in this direction",
    ". therefore , particles of the disk must move in trajectories close to geodesic ones .",
    "clearly , in a steady - state and axially symmetric flow , this can be realized only in two cases : when the matter moves almost radially towards the gravitating center ( and the specific angular momentum in the disk is everywhere close to zero ) or when the matter moves in almost circular orbits ( and the specific angular momentum , oppositely , is maximal ) .",
    "we note that both cases are consistent with the general assumptions discussed above and the result ( [ smallness_p ] ) .",
    "however , in the last case , the strict vertical hydrostatic equilibrium holds in the disk in the first order in @xmath235 ; in other words , ( [ euler_z ] ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath236    when the flow is almost radial , the corrections in the parentheses in ( [ hydrostatics ] ) are not small , and their value is determined by the contribution from the prevailing radial motion , when , due to the change in the disk thickness at each radius , the particles are accelerated in the @xmath23 direction .",
    "thus , the standard disk model includes one more independent assumption on the closeness of the fluid particle trajectories to equatorial circular orbits around the central black hole .",
    "therefore , we will additionally suppose that in our reference frame @xmath237 with @xmath238 and later we can see how this second small parameter is related to @xmath235 .",
    "consequently , we write equations first not only in the leading order in @xmath235 but also by assuming @xmath239 , i.e. that the flow moves along geodesic orbits and @xmath240 . wherever needed , we then additionally evaluate the contribution from the terms in the leading order in @xmath241 .",

    "strictly speaking , we should writ a relativistic analog of the radiation heat conductivity equation , which is a variant of the kinetic boltzmann equation for photons when their mean free path length is much smaller than the characteristic spatial length of the problem .",

    "the estimate of the threshold value of @xmath306 can be found , for example , in @xcite ( see formula 2.18 therein ) .",

    "in addition , later studies showed that the radiation - dominated region is thermally unstable @xcite and convectively unstable @xcite .",
    "this means that for the correct description of the inner parts of accretion disks at high accretion rates , when @xmath235 increases , terms of higher order in @xmath235 should be taken into account .",
    "these include the radial pressure gradient @xmath264 in the radial force balance and the advection term , @xmath327 , which arises in the energy balance and accounts for the radial heat transfer .",
    "the latter , in fact , implies that the heat diffusion time in the vertical direction is comparable to its radial advection due to radial transfer of matter . in other words , the main property of the standard accretion disk model considered here",
    "is violated : the local energy balance in the disk , when the heat generated due to turbulent energy dissipation is locally released from the disk surface .",

    "its explicit form and numerical value ( which depends on the black hole mass to which we normalize all quantities ) can be found by the reader .",
    "now , using formulas ( [ c_s_h ] ) , ( [ c_s_t ] ) , ( [ t_centr ] ) and ( [ sigma_expl ] ) , it is possible to derive the profile @xmath216 .",
    "the resulting disk aspect ratio reads @xmath358 : @xmath359 where @xmath360 is a constant that determines the characteristic disk thickness @xmath235 .",
    "in chapter 1 we described a flat disk in the equatorial disk around a rotating black hole .",
    "its axially symmetric structure was evident and consistent with the symmetry of space near the black hole .",
    "if now we relax the main assumption that the flow of matter at all distances coincides with the equatorial plane , the question arises : what can the dynamics of this more complicated flow , both stationary and non - stationary , be ? is this flow similar to a disk in any way ?",
    "for thin disks considered here , the answer to this question proves to be positive under some restrictions .",
    "the main reason for the deformation of ( for example , initially flat ) disk is that the black hole spin gives rise to an additional off - center gravitational interaction with the gas elements of the flow .",
    "it can be shown that far away from the event horizon but close to the equatorial plane of the black hole this interaction is presented by an axially symmetric field of force directed to the black hole spin axis in the planes parallel to the equatorial one ( see @xcite chapter 3 , paragraph a ) .",
    "this force is called gravitomagnetic force and is given in this case by the expression @xmath361 where @xmath128 is the keplerian frequency and @xmath362 is the radial coordinate ort of the cylinder reference frame .",
    "clearly , this external force can change the proper angular momentum of the disk elements ( and hence deform the disk ) moving outside the equatorial plane of the black hole . here",
    "only the projection of the gravitomagnetic force onto the angular momentum direction matters , which is proportional to the sine of the angle between the angular momentum vector and the black hole spin axis . as we will see",
    "shortly , the restriction that allows us to treat the new configuration as a disk ( both stationary and non - stationary ) requires that the gravitomagnetic force be smaller than the central gravitational attraction force , i.e. requires the smallness of the parameter @xmath363 .",
    "in addition , one more restriction can be formulated that the non - complanarity of the disk with the equatorial plane of the black hole , as well as the degree of its deviation from the planar form ( i.e. twist , warp ) should not exceed some small values for the disk to be hydrodynamically stable ( see @xcite paragraph 7 and @xcite paragraph 4.2.4 ) .",
    "let us split a thin planar disk into rings of small widths . in each ring",
    ", the motion of gas elements is mainly due to gravitational attraction force from the central body .",
    "the characteristic time of this motion is @xmath364 .",
    "in addition , @xmath365 determines the time it takes for the disk to restore the hydrodynamic equilibrium across the ring , since the disk aspect ratio ( the ratio of the the disk thickness to the radial distance ) is of the order of the ratio of the sound velocity to the orbital velocity .",
    "this conclusion can be also arrived at by noticing that vertical pressure gradient is @xmath366 times smaller than the unit mass gas element acceleration , i.e. exactly as small as the ratio of the radial size of the ring to its vertical scale .",
    "thus , we can conclude that if other forces acting on a given ring from the adjacent rings or from the black hole lead to the dynamics with the characteristic time @xmath367 much greater than the dynamical one , @xmath368 , the hydrostatic equilibrium is maintained in the ring , in other words , the ring remains flat , and the entire flow preserves the disk - like form .",
    "this is undoubtedly so in a flat disk , because in this case equally oriented rings interact by the viscous force acting in the azimuthal direction and the angular momentum changes due to inflow and outflow of the matter accreting through the ring , with the both processes occurring on the diffusion time scale , @xmath369 .",
    "now let the disk be tilted with respect to the equatorial plane of the black hole by a small angle @xmath370 .",
    "if in a flat disk the gravitomagnetic force contributes only to the modulus of acceleration of gas elements moving in circular orbits , but now , due to a non - zero projection of this force ( @xmath371 ) onto the angular momentum of gas elements , this force makes the orbits to precess around the black hole spin axis . for free particles ,",
    "this effect is described in detail in the second part of the next section in terms of the difference between the frequencies of circular and vertical motions .",
    "we also show that the precession frequency is much smaller than the circular frequency for @xmath372 ( see formula ( [ lense_tirring ] ) ) , which is equivalent to the condition @xmath368 for whole rings composed of gas elements .",
    "equation ( [ lense_tirring ] ) suggests that the precession of the rings is differential , i.e. depends on the distance to the center . as a result ,",
    "the relative orientation of initially coaxial rings changes and the disk is no longer flat .",
    "however , we keep in mind that under the condition @xmath368 each of the rings behaves rigidly in its vertical direction , which is now also a function of @xmath44 .",
    "the new configuration is similar to a twisted ( or warped ) disk , i.e. a flow symmetric relative to some ( now not planar ) surface , which can be called the equatorial surface of the twisted disk . here",
    ", the cross - section of the equatorial surface by a plane passing through the center is a circle  the instantaneous shape of orbits of gas elements rotating with a given radial distance @xmath44 .",
    "the disk turns into a set of rings tilted to the black hole equatorial plane by a constant angle @xmath373 but with depending on @xmath44 node lines ( the line formed by the intersection of the ring planes with the black hole equatorial plane ) .",
    "the node line is now determined by the position angle @xmath374 measured in the equatorial plane in the positive direction from a fixed direction to the ascending node of a given ring .",
    "the key point here is that the pressure gradient in the twisted disk , directed ( as in any thin disk in general ) almost normal to its warped surface , is not normal to the planes of the rings composing the disk .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the pressure gradient acquires two projections .",
    "the main projection is coaxial with the rotational axis of each ring .",
    "let us conventionally denote it as @xmath375 , where @xmath376 is the distance from the equatorial surface of the twisted disk measured along the direction of rotation of the ring ( @xmath376 reduces to @xmath23 in the case of a flat disk ) .",
    "we note from the beginning that @xmath377 due to the hydrostatic equilibrium across the ring .",
    "the second projection of the pressure gradient , conventionally denoted as @xmath378 , lies in the ring s plane along the radial direction connecting the disk center and a given gas element of the ring .",
    "the ratio of these two projections is a small value proportional to the rate of change of orientations of rings in the disk , which , in turn , depends on the radial direction chosen in the given ring s plane . from purely geometrical considerations ,",
    "we rigorously show in what follows that for a disk with @xmath379 the ratio @xmath380 , where @xmath381 is the angle measured in the azimuthal direction for the given ring from its ascending node to the given gas element .",
    "note that the normal to the twisted disk surface is orthogonal to the ring s plane only in two diametrically opposite points  where the ring s plane intersects the planes of the adjacent rings . at @xmath379 ,",
    "these points are characterized by @xmath382 . at the same time , in other pair of points with @xmath383 the value of @xmath378 reaches positive and negative maxima .",
    "thus , in a flat disk , the dynamics in the radial direction is controlled in the leading order in @xmath384 by the gravitation force and the corrections @xmath264 are neglected , whereas in a twisted disk the radial projection of the pressure gradient starts additionally contributing to the radial balance .",
    "this addition , on the one hand , depends on the degree of the twist , and on the other hand , increases proportionally to the distance from the equatorial disk surface , @xmath376 .",
    "next , because it also depends harmonically on the azimuthal direction , the gas elements ( for @xmath385 ) are subjected to periodic disturbance by this force with the orbital period , and their orbits become ellipses with small eccentricity . as is well known",
    ", the eigenfrequency of the small oscillations of free particles in eccentric orbits is equal to the epicyclic frequency , @xmath386 . because the pressure gradient projection considered here excites exactly such oscillations , the radial profile of the epicyclic frequency , @xmath387 , is an important characteristic that determines the shape of both stationary and non - stationary twisted configurations . in the next section",
    ", we derive the required relativistic profile @xmath387 for equatorial circular orbits in the kerr metric ( see equation ( [ epic_freq_kerr ] ) ) .",
    "note from the beginning that in the special case of newtonian gravitation @xmath388 , and hence the action of the external exciting force on gas elements with the same frequency results in a resonance : the amplitude of the perturbed motion , characterized by perturbation of the orbital velocity , @xmath389 , must increase without a bound .",
    "this growth , however , is always limited by turbulent viscosity in the disk . indeed , since the exciting force amplitude @xmath390 , so is the amplitude of @xmath389 . but",
    "this would mean the presence of the vertical velocity shear , @xmath391 , in each ring .",
    "together with the vertical density gradient ( and hence the vertical gradient of the dynamic viscosity ) in the disk , this gives rise to a volume viscous force that damps the driving of individual layers of each disk s ring by the resonance force .",
    "note that near the black hole , where the frequency @xmath386 deviates from @xmath128 , the amplitude @xmath389 remains bounded even in the absence of viscous forces .",
    "this allows the existence of stationary twisted disks with low viscosity around the black holes , in which @xmath392 takes an oscillatory form ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we see that the twist of the disk caused by the gravitomagnetic force necessarily results in a perturbation of the circular motion of gas elements in disk s rings .",
    "the velocity field of this perturbation , @xmath389 , depends on @xmath44 ( in addition to its being proportional to @xmath390 , as explained above ) and is determined by the current shape of the disk . by virtue of the continuity of the flow , this gives rise to density inhomogeneities outside the disk equatorial surface , @xmath393 . because @xmath394 , these inhomogeneities take the opposite signs in the diametrically opposite points of any given ring . but",
    "this implies that the ring is subjected to the total torque of the central gravitational force acting on the density excesses out of the equatorial plane of the ring ( i.e. outside @xmath395 ) .",
    "we denote this torque as @xmath396 . because the disk is thin and",
    "the gravitational acceleration along ring s axis is itself @xmath397 , the corresponding component of the gravitational force , and @xmath398 as well , are quadratic in @xmath376 .",
    "in addition , we remind that the torque @xmath398 is proportional to the small warp magnitude , @xmath399 .",
    "thus , we arrive at the conclusion that the dynamics of the twisted disk rings is controlled by @xmath398 , together with the torque due to the gravitomagnetic force discussed earlier in this introductory section . note that in the case @xmath379 considered here , @xmath400 and , correspondingly , @xmath401 take the maximum absolute values ( but with the opposite signs ) at @xmath402 , i.e. at the node line of each ring . and",
    "@xmath401 occurs only when the action of viscosity on the gas elements of the ring is neglected . ] but this implies that @xmath398 lies in the plane made by the angular momentum of each ring and the black hole spin axis . by virtue of the symmetry of the problem , the total contribution to @xmath398 from other azimuths does not alter its direction .",
    "therefore , immediately after the gravitomagnetic force turns an imaginary tilted planar disk into a twisted configuration with @xmath379 , the gravitational force acting on the asymmetrically located matter of the disk relative to the surface @xmath395 tends to change the disk rings tilt angles : either to align the rings with the equatorial plane of the black hole or , conversely , to remove them from it . on the other hand ,",
    "once @xmath373 becomes dependent on @xmath44 , the maxima of absolute values of @xmath400 are shifted from the node line of each ring to some new @xmath381 , which gives rise to a component in @xmath398 that also contributes to the precession motion of the disk rings , as the gravitomagnetic torque does .",
    "the dynamics of twisted disks sketched above is complicated by the presence of non - zero viscosity in the disk .",
    "first of all , each ring of the disk is subjected to the action of the viscous force arising due to the difference between the direction of the tangential velocity of the ring and that of the adjacent rings .",
    "this difference is maximal in the directions where the ring planes intersect , i.e. exactly where @xmath400 vanishes . in the above example of configuration with @xmath379",
    "this corresponds to @xmath382 , i.e. perpendicular to the node line of the rings .",
    "the viscous force , being proportional to the difference in tangential velocities , is directed at these points perpendicular to the ring plane and has different signs on different sides from the node line .",
    "therefore , the corresponding torque , @xmath403 is perpendicular to the plane made by the ring s angular momentum and the black hole spin axis .",
    "in other words , the viscous interaction between the disk rings leads only to their precession around the black hole spin .",
    "note also that the viscous torque @xmath404 , which appears due to the difference between the tangential velocities of adjacent rings , and @xmath405 due to the viscosity coefficient .",
    "it is important to note that as soon as the profile @xmath392 is formed due to the gravitational torque @xmath398 , the viscous torque @xmath403 starts causing alignment / misalignment of the ring with the equatorial plane of the black hole .",
    "this happens for the same reasons by which @xmath398 also starts contributing to the precession motion , as discussed above .",
    "in addition to causing the appearance of @xmath403 , the viscosity in a twisted disk , like in a flat accretion disk , leads to the radial diffusion transfer of the angular momentum component parallel to the equatorial plane of the black hole ( which is non zero exactly for a tilted / twisted disk ) toward the disk center due to simple transport of the accreting matter , and toward its periphery due to the corresponding angular momentum outflow . in the case of a relativistic disk ,",
    "an additional loss of this angular momentum component occurs due to the thermal energy outflow by radiation from the disk surface ( see equation ( c6 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "all forces participating in the dynamics of twisted disks appear in the so - called ` twist ' equation  the principal equation of the twisted disk theory . this equation is derived and analyzed in the subsequent sections .",

    "therefore , we first analyze the properties of free particles moving in orbits slightly different from circular ones .",
    "we first assume that particles move exactly in the equatorial plane but in slightly non - circular orbits .",
    "the problem can be solved using relativistic hydrodynamic equations with zero pressure and by assuming that there is a small addition to the purely circular velocity .",
    "then , instead of equations ( [ euler ] ) and ( [ energy ] ) , it is better to use the original equations in the form @xmath406 where in the considered case of free motion , @xmath407 and @xmath408 . under the last assumption , the velocity field , as follows from the rest - energy conservation law ( [ continuity ] ) , is divergence - free , and ( [ epic_tik ] ) is equivalent to the following equation : @xmath409 we now single out from the four - velocity field a small addition to the main circular equatorial motion and denote it as @xmath410 .",

    ", we obtain linear equations for small perturbations of the four - velocity , @xmath413 , which is assumed to be a function of @xmath35 only : @xmath414 taking into account that @xmath415 , for @xmath416 we obtain the system of equations @xmath417 @xmath418 it follows that small perturbations of the four - velocity components in the equatorial plane of the rotating black hole oscillate in time .",

    "it is important to note that ( [ epic_freq_kerr ] ) contains a derivative with respect to the coordinate time , and therefore the epicyclic frequency is determined by the clock of an infinitely remote observer , similarly to circular frequency ( [ kepl_freq ] ) introduced above . by comparing equation ( [ eq_r_ms ] ) , which defines the location of the innermost stable circular equatorial orbit in the kerr metric , @xmath87 , with ( [ epic_freq_kerr ] )",

    "this result was obtained from the analysis of the form of the effective centrifugal potential in which a test particle moves in an equatorial circular orbit .",
    "nevertheless , we see that @xmath87 can be determined alternatively from the calculation of the profile @xmath423 in the kerr metric .",
    "it is well known that for newtonian motion so - called keplerian degeneration occurs when @xmath388 for a non - circular motion , which causes non - relativistic orbits to be closed .",
    "however , this symmetry is broken for relativistic free motion , and the epicyclic frequency @xmath386 differs from @xmath128 already near a non - rotating ( @xmath81 ) black hole , where its square is @xmath424 the difference between the epicyclic and circular frequencies results in the well known effect of the precession of an elliptical orbit . far away from the horizon of a schwarzschild black hole ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath425 , the frequency of the orbit rotation , called the einstein precession frequency , is @xmath426 .",
    "we now suppose that we rotate together with the test particle at some radius .",
    "when considering the problem in the projection onto tetrad ( [ e_1]-[e_4 ] ) , this particle remains at rest .",
    "we now impart to the particle a small velocity in the direction perpendicular to the equatorial plane .",
    "equation ( [ hydrostatics_rel ] ) of hydrostatic equilibrium for a flat disk implies that in our reference frame the particle , being in free motion , is subjected to acceleration that is proportional to @xmath23 and tends to return the particle to @xmath40 . as a result",
    ", the test particle will harmonically oscillates with a frequency whose square is      where the superscript ` l ' reminds us that the frequency is measured in the reference frame comoving with the particle in its main circular equatorial motion .",
    "to re - define this frequency as measured by the clock of an infinite observer , as has been done for both circular and epicyclic frequencies , the frequency @xmath428 must be divided by the time dilation factor ( the difference between the proper time of the particle and the time at infinity ) , i.e. by the @xmath429component of the four - velocity ( [ geod_vel ] ) .",
    "thus , the square of the frequency of vertical oscillations is @xmath430 which coincides , for example , with the expression presented in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "( [ vert_freq ] ) implies that around a non - rotating black hole @xmath431 .",
    "this means that the vertical and circular motions have the same period , and the total motion of the particle is again the circular motion in a closed orbit whose plane , however , is now slightly tilted toward the initial equatorial plane .",
    "the situation changes for @xmath432 , because for @xmath433 the orbit is not closed any more , and the orbital plane starts precessing around the spin axis of the black hole .",
    "the frequency of the orbital precession is equal to the difference between the circular and vertical frequencies . for a slowly rotating black hole with @xmath372 the precession frequency of a slightly tilted orbit is @xmath434",
    "this is simply the angular velocity of the frame dragging by the rotating black hole ( see equation ( [ lt ] ) ) in the limit @xmath372 .",
    "the frequency @xmath435 is also referred to as the lense - thirring frequency .    in the most general case , where the test particle deviates from circular motion simultaneously in the vertical and horizontal directions , the particle s motion in space",
    "can be described by a slightly elliptical orbit , with both plane and apse line turning with an angular velocity proportional to the difference between the circular and vertical frequency and the difference between the circular and epicyclic frequency , respectively . for @xmath372 ,",
    "the precession of the orbital plane occurs on a timescale much longer than the dynamical time , @xmath436 , where @xmath437 ( see the discussion in the previous section ) .        taking the general conclusions in section 2.1 into account",
    ", we consider slowly rotating black holes , @xmath372 . in this case , the linear expansion of the kerr metric in the parameter @xmath10 is sufficient",
    ". then formula ( [ kerr ] ) takes the form        our main purpose in this section is to introduce the relativistic reference frame that follows the disk twist .",
    "the symmetry of the problem implies that the equations of motion should have the simplest form in such a frame . as for a flat disk ,",
    "it is convenient to use some orthonormal non - coordinate basis . for this basis to follow the disk shape , its two spatial orts should be tangent to the disk symmetry plane . at each spatial point",
    "we take the orts of the flat basis , which are determined , say , by the equatorial plane of the black hole , and turn them by the angles @xmath373 and @xmath439 defining the disk shape .",
    "this is done in the simplest way by using a cartesian coordinate system with the axis @xmath23 parallel to the black hole spin .",
    "however , we should first understand which four - dimensional basis ( whose dual tetrad must transform the metric ( [ kerr_lt ] ) into the minkowski metric ) in the flat - space limit would produce the spatial part described by the cartesian reference frame .        substituting ( [ r_i ] ) in ( [ kerr_lt ] ) yields @xmath443 where the second term represents the elementary spherical volume .",
    "now , it is easy to transform to the cartesian coordinates by the change @xmath444 . with account for @xmath445",
    "we have          note that basis ( [ dual_tw_1 ] ) corresponds to the observers at rest in the schwarzschild coordinates , because their world lines defined by the condition @xmath450 , correspond to the equalities @xmath451 .",
    "their identical clocks are synchronized in such a way that in equal time intervals determined by the ort @xmath452 , light travels an equal distance in any direction defined by the combination of the @xmath453 .",
    "if the observers used the coordinate time , @xmath35 , they would discover , for example , that the light signal in the azimuthal direction prograde with the black hole spin travels a larger distance than in the opposite ( retrograde ) direction .",
    "this follows from the frame - dragging effect of a rotating black hole and is equivalent to the well - known tilt of light cones in the azimuthal direction .",
    "finally , we note that another choice of the orthonormal basis is possible in principle , which also compensates the space - dragging effect .",
    "such a basis is called the frame of locally non - rotating observers , which is moving with the azimuthal angular velocity equal to ( [ lt ] ) ; mathematically , this corresponds to the correction of the azimuthal ort instead of the time one ( see @xcite ) .",
    "below , we need to rotate the spatial part of ( [ dual_tw_1 ] ) , so as to obtain the dual twisted basis and then the original basis , which , as we recall , is needed to write down the projection of hydrodynamic equations . for this ,",
    "let us first introduce the twisted cylindrical coordinates .",

    "the relation between @xmath457 and @xmath458 can be obtained by a sequence of rotations at each radial distance by the angles @xmath459 and @xmath460 .        where three spatial cartesian coordinates are defined in a frame with the @xmath23-axis tilted by the angle @xmath459 toward the black hole spin and the @xmath462-axis lying in the black hole equatorial plane and turned by the angle @xmath374 relative to some direction common for all @xmath44 .",

    "this means that we should take basis ( [ dual_tw_1 ] ) as a column and first multiply it by the matrix @xmath467 and then by the matrix @xmath468 .",
    "after that , because we wish to obtain the basis corresponding to the ( twisted ) cylindrical frame , it is necessary to additionally advance the three spatial orts by azimuthal angle @xmath381 , what is achieved by additional multiplication of the basis by the matrix @xmath469 .    as a result",
    ", we obtain the twisted dual basis that contains some linear combinations of the flat coordinate orts , @xmath470 .",
    "it remains to express it as linear combinations of coordinate orts of the twisted coordinate frame , @xmath471 .",
    "for this , it suffices to take differentials of the coordinate transformation ( given by ( [ transform ] ) in the linear approximation in @xmath373 ) and to substitute them in the twisted dual basis obtained after the rotations .",
    "it can be checked that in the approximation linear in @xmath373 and @xmath10 , we have              we also introduce new variables characterizing the disk geometry : @xmath477 and from now on use them instead of the angles @xmath478 and @xmath479 .",
    "additionally , @xmath480 where partial derivatives with respect to @xmath455 and @xmath44 are denoted by the dot and the prime .      as discussed above , observers transporting basis ( [ dual_tw_1 ] ) are at rest in the schwarzschild coordinates . on the contrary , observers corresponding to basis ( [ dual_tw_21]-[dual_tw_24 ] ) move in space by following the changing shape of the twisted disk ( in the non - stationary dynamics ) .",

    "only the condition @xmath384 is important .      exactly this combination ( [ tw_geod ] )",
    "is used in the derivation ; however , it can be checked that together with ( [ u_norm ] ) in the approximation linear in @xmath10 it gives the solution @xmath530 where we have transited to the schwarzschild radial coordinate @xmath531 which is equivalent to @xmath44 , that we used in chapter 1 in the expression for @xmath532 ( see formula ( [ geod_vel ] ) ) .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath533 , as must be the case with the transition from the coordinate basis to @xmath491 taken into account .",
    "the principal kinematic constraint for the twisted reference frame requires a constant vertical position of fluid particles : @xmath534 which is provided by fast establishment of hydrostatic equilibrium across the disk compared to the dynamical time of the twist change , as discussed in section 2.1 .",
    "however , as has been already noted in @xcite , an important point is that this does not mean that the projection of the four - velocity of the fluid onto @xmath535 is also zero , because our basis is non - coordinate and its orts are not tangent to the coordinate lines .        using ( [ dual_tw_24 ] )",
    "we have : @xmath537 we should substitute @xmath538 and @xmath539 in this relation in the zeroth order in @xmath373 , in other words , as values corresponding to the flat disk dynamics .",
    "expressions for @xmath540 , @xmath541 and @xmath542 at @xmath489 give      where by definition @xmath544 . as a result , we obtain @xmath545 where @xmath546 in ( [ v_xi ] ) the velocity components @xmath547 and @xmath277 should be taken from the corresponding background solution for a flat disk .      now , using ( [ u_norm]-[v_xi ] ) , we write equations ( [ tik_tw ] ) in explicit form by keeping only the terms in the leading order in the two small parameters @xmath235 and @xmath548 is necessary to ensure that the accretion flow outside the equatorial plane of the black hole can be considered as a disk. in turn , this is jointly ensured by the smallness of both @xmath235 and @xmath549 ( see section [ sec_freq ] ) . ] . here , we take into account that quantities of thermal origin in the background solution are small , i.e. @xmath550 and @xmath551 ( see chapter 1 ) .",
    "we postpone discussing the effects of the fluid non - ideality for a while .",
    "note that this assumption not only corresponds to vanishing terms with viscosity coefficient and energy flux density , or their perturbations , but also means the absence of contributions @xmath552 . to select the leading - order terms in the ideal fluid approximation , we start by considering second terms in the @xmath455- , @xmath44- and @xmath553-projections of ( [ tik_tw ] ) .",
    "it turns out that such terms are proportional to @xmath554 here , and in the @xmath44-projection of ( [ tik_tw ] ) this contribution is due to the projection of the vertical pressure gradient onto the orbital plane of motion of matter in the twisted disk ( see the analysis in section 2.1 where this quantity was denoted by `` @xmath400 '' ) . in addition , in the @xmath455- and @xmath553-projections of ( [ tik_tw ] ) involve terms @xmath555 , which should be also kept . on the other hand ,",
    "the first terms in the @xmath455- , @xmath44- and @xmath553-projections of ( [ tik_tw ] ) give rise to terms containing eulerian velocity perturbations , @xmath556 , as well as the eulerian rest - mass energy density perturbation , @xmath401 .",
    "hence , we conclude that @xmath557 in addition , for reasons that become clear below , we temporarily keep partial derivatives of @xmath410 and @xmath401 with respect to time , despite their being @xmath558 times smaller than the quantities themselves .",
    "finally , the first terms of the @xmath455- and @xmath553-projections of ( [ tik_tw ] ) also contain terms with the combination @xmath559 , whose amplitudes are restricted by the order @xmath560 by equation ( [ v_xi ] ) .",
    "now , using the result ( [ v_tw ] ) , it is easy to select the leading terms entering in the @xmath455- , @xmath44- and @xmath553-projections of ( [ tik_tw ] ) due to the fluid non - ideality .",
    "the most troublesome here is the contribution due to the shear tensor perturbation , @xmath561 , which appears in @xmath562 ( see ( [ t_1_ik ] ) and ( [ sigma_1_ik ] ) ) .",
    "however , most of the terms from this contribution contain jointly @xmath563 and @xmath564 ; therefore , it is clear that it is necessary to include only the terms in which the derivative with respect to @xmath376 ( lowering the order in @xmath235 ) occurs twice .",
    "this fact strongly reduces the number of viscous terms to be kept . besides , by similar considerations , the final expressions will not contain terms with @xmath203 , @xmath565 and @xmath566 . finally , we stress once again that in addition to the purely viscous terms mentioned above , the contribution due to the radial advection that appears in the background solution with non - zero viscosity should not be forgotten .",
    "we are concerned with the terms that can appear in the non - viscous part of the stress - energy tensor ( see the first term in ( [ tik ] ) ) due to the non - zero value of @xmath567 .",
    "we note that @xmath575 and @xmath576 have the meaning of perturbations of the viscous stress tensor . in these expressions , the terms @xmath490 contributing to the shear tensor perturbations appear due to the twisted basis .",
    "conversely , @xmath577 relates to the background .",
    "nevertheless , for the sake of brevity , we use the same notation with the index `` @xmath335 '' for these three quantities .",
    "finally , we assume in ( [ tau_tw]-[t_nu ] ) that in the relativistic coefficients @xmath578 , @xmath579 and @xmath580 , the argument @xmath441 is replaced by @xmath44 , because @xmath581 and accounting for the dependence on @xmath376 here always gives rise to a small correction @xmath514 only .",
    "it remains to write the explicit form of the @xmath376-projection of ( [ tik_tw ] ) .",
    "similarly , we start with the contribution of terms in the ideal fluid approximation , and first rearrange the first term in ( [ tik_tw ] ) .",
    "the leading - order terms in @xmath235 here are , in particular , @xmath582 and @xmath401 , but additionally multiplied by @xmath376 .",
    "this means that their amplitudes are restricted by the order @xmath583 .",
    "moreover , @xmath584 now enters the term `` @xmath585 '' which also implies the raising of the order of smallness by @xmath235 compared to ( [ tau_tw]-[phi_tw ] ) ( it can be seen that in formulas ( [ tau_tw ] ) and ( [ phi_tw ] ) @xmath584 entered in combination with @xmath586 ) . besides , of all terms of a ` thermal ' origin we must now keep the term with @xmath587 , since it also is of the order of @xmath251 due to @xmath588 .    turning now to the second term in the @xmath376-projection of ( [ tik_tw ] ) , we write all terms through the order @xmath589 . from similar considerations , the terms due to fluid non - ideality ( including ` advective ' terms proportional to @xmath552 )",
    "are also kept here , with their smallness increased by the coefficient @xmath235 compared to what we did in ( [ tau_tw]-[phi_tw ] ) .",

    "we do not provide the explicit form of @xmath593 here , because it is not required in the final form of the twist equations .    everywhere in ( [ xi_tw]-[f_xi ] ) , except in the second term in square brackets in the right - hand side of ( [ xi_tw ] ) , the argument @xmath441 in the relativistic coefficients @xmath578 , @xmath579 and @xmath580 is replaced by @xmath44 .",
    "the mentioned term is an exception because this term alone has the zeroth order in small parameters @xmath235 and @xmath594 in equation ( [ xi_tw ] ) .",
    "but because we have kept the terms @xmath595 in ( [ xi_tw ] ) , in the term under discussion it would be necessary to take corrections @xmath514 into account due to the dependence of the relativistic coefficients @xmath579 and @xmath580 on @xmath376 .",
    "we did not do that for the reason discussed in the next paragraph .",

    "then it becomes totally clear that equations ( [ tau_tw]-[phi_tw ] ) are restricted by the order @xmath598 , and equation ( [ xi_tw ] ) is restricted by the order @xmath514 .    at the same time , when the parameter @xmath10 is non - zero",
    ", a ` large ' term of the zeroth order in @xmath235 and @xmath599 arises in the right - hand side of equation ( [ xi_tw ] ) .",

    ", we must assume that @xmath600 .",
    "but it then becomes clear that all additional corrections @xmath601 in equations ( [ tau_tw]-[phi_tw ] ) have the next order in @xmath235 and can be omitted . the same relates to all terms @xmath602 in equation ( [ xi_tw ] ) , including the correction @xmath514 due to the dependence of the relativistic coefficients on @xmath441 in the gravitomagnetic term itself .",
    "in fact , this means that when considering the dynamics of a twisted thin accretion disk near a rotating black hole , it suffices to use the background model , i.e. the corresponding flat disk , in the schwarzschild metric with @xmath81 .",
    "the assumption of the slow black hole rotation itself was needed because otherwise the accretion flow ( including non - stationary one ) could not be regarded as a disk , since the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium there would be violated ( see section 2.1 ) .",
    "of course , these conclusions relate to only slightly tilted / twisted and geometrically thin disks with @xmath370 , @xmath384 .    in",
    "what follows , we therefore set @xmath81 in all terms except the gravitomagnetic one .",
    "this significantly simplifies further calculations that are required for obtaining the twist equations in the final form .",
    "let us first analyze equations ( [ tau_tw ] ) and ( [ phi_tw ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to consider their combinations which contain either @xmath603 or @xmath604 .    eliminating @xmath604 for @xmath81 we obtain the equation @xmath605 where we have omitted the term @xmath606 , which is of the next order in @xmath235 compared to the other terms . in the newtonian limit as @xmath607 , equation ( [ tw_cont ] ) reduces to the continuity equation for perturbations .",

    "it is important to explain why we have kept terms with @xmath611 and @xmath604 in equations ( [ tw_phi_new ] ) and ( [ tw_r_new ] ) although they are of the next order in @xmath235 .",
    "as mentioned in section 2.1 , in the newtonian limit the epicyclic frequency becomes equal to the keplerian circular frequency , which results in a resonance growth of the amplitude of velocity perturbations of gas elements in the disk under the action of the radial projection of the vertical pressure gradient , @xmath400 , which is limited only by the viscosity .",
    "mathematically expressed , in the limit of an inviscid keplerian disk , equation ( [ tw_phi_new ] ) yields in the leading order in the parameter @xmath594 ( with the term with @xmath612 omitted ) such a relation between @xmath419 and @xmath613 that the sum of the second and the third terms in ( [ tw_r_new ] ) vanishes .",
    "but , because there is a term @xmath614 in the right - hand side of ( [ tw_r_new ] ) , it follows that @xmath611 ( and hence @xmath604 as well ) acquires the first order in @xmath235 in the considered case .",
    "either viscosity or relativistic corrections eliminate the keplerian resonance , and the amplitudes of @xmath611 and @xmath604 decrease again to the third order in @xmath235 .",
    "now , from equation ( [ xi_tw ] ) we need to derive the so - called twist equation that plays the principal role in the twisted disk theory . for this ,",
    "we need to explicitly determine the value @xmath615 , which is done in the next section .",
    "although the schwarzschild approximation is sufficient , we also take linear corrections in @xmath10 into account .",
    "this is required below in obtaining an additional expression for the lense - thirring frequency in terms of the relativistic coefficients used in the twisted basis .",
    "let us write the @xmath376-projection of ( [ tik_0 ] ) in the basis @xmath616 to the leading order in @xmath235 , as we did in chapter 1 employing basis ( [ e_1]-[e_4 ] ) ( see equation ( [ hydrostatics_rel ] ) ) .",
    "taking into account that the four - velocity of the flow is @xmath617 in the leading order in @xmath235 , we obtain the following equation      where @xmath515 and @xmath516 satisfy the normalization condition ( [ u_norm ] ) and the geodesic equation ( [ tw_geod ] ) . with this in mind ,",
    "we arrive at the final form of the hydrostatic equilibrium equation @xmath619 where the schwarzschild profiles of @xmath515 and @xmath516 are used in the term with the parameter @xmath10 .",

    "it turns out that to do this it is necessary to eliminate from ( [ xi_tw ] ) @xmath613 and @xmath401 , in the left - hand side of this equation .",
    "therefore , we will use equations ( [ tw_cont]-[tw_r_new ] ) with @xmath623 for our purposes , because nowhere we will deal with resonance combinations of @xmath419 and @xmath613 that vanishes in the main order in @xmath594 in the keplerian inviscid limit ( see the comment to equations ( [ tw_phi_new ] ) and ( [ tw_r_new ] ) above ) .",

    "unknown variables in this system include the velocity perturbations @xmath419 and @xmath613 and the quantity @xmath629 characterizing the disk geometry .",
    "we emphasize that in deriving these equations we essentially used only three main assumptions : @xmath372 , @xmath384 and @xmath370 .",
    "this means that the equations describe the dynamics of any geometrically thin accretion flow ( disk ) with any parametrization of viscosity , any radial and vertical structure in both stationary and non - stationary case . in the latter case , we mean the non - stationary background : the equations determine not only the dynamics of twist perturbations propagating in a stationary flat disk , but also the dynamics of twisted rings / tori , when the evolution of the geometrical form occurs in parallel with its expansion in the radial direction due to turbulent viscosity , which also results in the evolution of the background itself .      in section [ sec_freq ] , we already obtained relativistic expressions for the characteristic frequencies of the problem .",
    "these include the circular and epicyclic frequencies of free equatorial motion , as well as the frequency of vertical oscillations and the precession frequency of tilted orbits . here",

    "the circular frequency of the free equatorial motion as measured by the clock of an infinitely remote observer , which we already presented in equation ( [ kepl_freq ] ) , can be obtained simply by dividing @xmath630 by @xmath538 given in ( [ for_v_xi ] ) .",

    "the frequency @xmath634 explicitly enters the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium ( see equation ( [ hydrostatics_rel ] ) or equivalent equation ( [ hydrostat_tw_fin ] ) with the substitution @xmath635 ) . using relations ( [ for_v_xi ] )",

    "this does not mean , however , that only stationary twisted solutions are to be considered . in other words , the equations we obtain are also applicable to arbitrary non - stationary dynamics of the corresponding twisted disk .",
    "for example , they enable us to calculate the evolution of the shape of an ( infinite ) initially flat disk instantly tilted to the equatorial plane of a rotating black hole .",
    "the initial stage of the evolution of such a disk was qualitatively described in section [ sec_intro ] .",
    "in addition , these equations describe the wave - like ( in the case of a disk with sufficiently small @xmath646 ; see also @xcite ) or diffusion - like ( in the case of a disk with sufficiently large @xmath647 ; see also @xcite ) dynamics of some twisted perturbation imposed on the disk lying initially in the equatorial plane of the black hole .",
    "the twist equations contain the quantity @xmath648 ( as well as @xmath649 ) , related to the corresponding flat disk model .",
    "we could obtain the explicit form of these quantities by integrating the @xmath650 and @xmath651projections of equations ( [ tik_0 ] ) .",
    "however , it is simpler to use the results of chapter 1 , where we have already obtained this quantity , denoted by @xmath274 there ( see equation ( [ t_sol_fin ] ) ) .",
    "we should only take into account that now we are working in another basis than that used for the flat disk , and therefore the transition from @xmath274 to @xmath648 should be specified .",
    "first , using the orthogonality condition for the shear tensor and , hence , for the viscous stress tensor , ( [ sigma_orth ] ) , we see that only one component of the viscous stress tensor , @xmath652 , is non - zero in basis ( [ e_1]-[e_4 ] ) , because the four - velocity there has only non - zero time component up to the terms @xmath514 .",
    "the prime here marks basis ( [ e_1]-[e_4 ] ) .",
    "further , the ( orthonormal ) bases are different only in that the observers associated with basis ( [ e_1]-[e_4 ] ) move in the azimuthal direction with the velocity of the free equatorial circular motion , whereas the basis @xmath491 corresponds to the observers at rest .",
    "therefore , the transformations of vectors and tensors must be equivalent to the usual lorentz transformations . using @xcite ( see exercise 1 , paragraph 6 therein ) we see that @xmath653 where @xmath515 is the lorentz factor of azimuthal motion .",

    "next , for the case @xmath81 , which is sufficient here , it is easy to express @xmath274 in terms of elementary functions .",

    ", we obtain the following complex equations @xmath695 @xmath696 where we have used equation ( [ alpha_prescr ] ) , as well as expressions for frequencies ( [ om_circ ] ) , ( [ kappa_tw ] ) and ( [ tilde_freq ] ) obtained in section [ sec_completion ] .    in a similar way , by using ( [ vab ] ) and ( [ compl_ampl ] ) and composing the combination @xmath697 , we derive an equation for complex amplitudes . in the right - hand side of this equation",
    ", the integration over @xmath376 should be performed under the derivative with respect to @xmath44 . for an isothermal disk with density distribution ( [ rho_xi ] ) , the equality @xmath698 holds .",
    "thus , the derivative with respect to @xmath44 acts on terms proportional to @xmath699 or @xmath649 . instead of these combinations",
    ", we substitute equations ( [ sigma_h2 ] ) and ( [ eta_tw ] ) there and group common constant factors before the derivative with respect to @xmath44 .",
    "additionally , instead of @xmath277 and @xmath657 we substitute expressions ( [ tw_ur ] ) and ( [ t_tw1 ] ) in the left - hand side of the discussed equation and then divide the whole equation by @xmath354 .",
    "the obtained equation contains @xmath306 and @xmath354 only in the combination @xmath700 , which we express through @xmath251 and other known quantities using ( [ sigma_h2 ] ) . also using the expression for lense - thirring frequency ( [ lense_tirring_fin ] )",
    ", we finally arrive at the following equation @xmath701    equations ( [ compl_a]-[compl_w ] ) form a closed system of equations for the quantities @xmath98 , @xmath702 and @xmath703 as functions of @xmath44 and @xmath455 . in the weak gravity limit they reduce to equations ( 30 ) , ( 31 ) and ( 33 ) in @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath704 . after eliminating @xmath98 from ( [ compl_a]-[compl_b ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath705 ( i-\\alpha)\\omega { \\bf b } = \\left [ ( i+\\alpha)u^\\varphi \\omega - \\frac{3i\\alpha}{i-\\alpha } k_1 ( u^\\tau)^2u^\\varphi \\tilde \\omega \\right ] { \\bf w}^\\prime,\\ ] ] whence we express @xmath702 through @xmath706 and substitute it in equation ( [ compl_w ] ) .",
    "we thus obtain the equation @xmath707 where the asterisk denotes complex conjugation and @xmath708    we note that equation ( [ tw_stat ] ) was written after changing to the schwarzschild radial coordinate @xmath531 . in what follows ,",
    "we wish to consider only the case @xmath709 , i.e. a prograde disk .",
    "it can be seen that the problem has two free parameters .",
    "first of all , this is the combination @xmath710 . clearly , @xmath711 ranges from @xmath712 to @xmath713 and characterizes the relative role of the hydrodynamic and gravitomagnetic forces acting on the disk rings .",
    "second , ( [ tw_stat ] ) contains the disk viscosity parameter @xmath337 .",
    "equation ( [ tw_stat ] ) in the rigorous newtonian limit with non - zero viscosity reproduces the corresponding equation ( 2.10 ) from @xcite and , additionally , with post - newtonian corrections , reproduces equation ( 33 ) from @xcite , what is checked in @xcite ( see paragraph 4.1 therein ) .",
    "the coefficients of equation ( [ tw_stat ] ) have a singular point at the inner edge of the disk at @xmath714 , where @xmath32 vanishes .",
    "the regularity of the solution at @xmath715 must yield a condition for the function @xmath703 . using this condition as the initial one",
    ", we can integrate ( [ tw_stat ] ) from @xmath715 to infinity and to obtain the form of the stationary twisted disk .",
    "we expand equation ( [ tw_stat ] ) in series in orders of the small @xmath716 . in practice , to do this , all quantities that take non - zero values at @xmath715 should be set exactly equal to these values and @xmath32 should be expanded to the main order in @xmath717 . from ( [ l_expr ] ) , we find @xmath718 whence we see that another quantity in ( [ tw_stat ] ) that vanishes at the inner disk edge , @xmath235 , can be written as @xmath719 where @xmath199 is the power - law exponent @xmath32 in equation ( [ delta_1 ] ) .",
    "accordingly , @xmath720 is also given by equation ( [ delta_1 ] ) , which is taken at @xmath715 and into which we now substitute the coefficient @xmath721 from ( [ l_appr ] ) instead of @xmath32 .",
    "after that , it is easy to obtain the equation valid for @xmath722 , @xmath723 where @xmath724 and @xmath725 are taken at @xmath715 .",
    "we see that for any finite viscosity the last term in ( [ bound_eq ] ) becomes dominant sufficiently close to the disk edge ; therefore , the boundary condition can be straightforwardly written as @xmath726    on the other hand , from ( [ bound_eq ] ) with @xmath727 , we obtain a simpler equation whose solution is a bessel function : @xmath728 where @xmath729 as @xmath730 ( [ bound_cond2 ] ) tends to a non - zero constant but with a zero derivative with respect to @xmath717 .",
    "therefore , in this case we return to condition ( [ bound_cond1 ] ) .    due to the linearity of the problem , it suffices to take an arbitrary non - zero value of @xmath703 in @xmath715 , to set the first derivative of @xmath703 at @xmath715 equal to zero , and with these boundary conditions to integrate ( [ tw_stat ] ) up to infinity .",
    "the modulus and phase of @xmath703 give the profiles @xmath731 and @xmath732 for a stationary twisted disk .",
    "in what follows , we normalize the profile @xmath373 to unity at infinity .",
    "we consider a disk with a very low viscosity separately .",
    "clearly , it is possible to analytically treat the accretion disk setting formally @xmath733 , if simultaneously @xmath734 . in such a disk , @xmath735",
    ", however , it then has definite profiles of @xmath354 and @xmath39 .",
    "the coefficients in ( [ eq_invisc ] ) take real values ; therefore , there are real solutions of this equation .",
    "this means that in the absence of viscosity in the stationary twisted disk @xmath739 which can be set equal to zero by the corresponding choice of the reference frame .",
    "therefore , the variable @xmath703 is identical to the angle @xmath373 in this section .      in the foregoing",
    ", we have already presented the solution near the inner edge of the inviscid disk ( see equation ( [ bound_cond2 ] ) ) .",
    "the constant @xmath740 in this case has the explicit form : @xmath741 and is taken at @xmath742 .    using the known approximation for the bessel function of small argument",
    ", we obtain a relation between the constant @xmath162 in ( [ bound_cond2 ] ) and the value of @xmath703 at @xmath715 , @xmath743 : @xmath744 where @xmath745 is the gamma - function .",
    "we consider equation ( [ tw_stat ] ) for @xmath750 and @xmath733 .",
    "importantly , we can not set all variables in ( [ tw_stat ] ) to their newtonian values and have the viscosity simultaneously vanished .",
    "this already follows from the fact that then @xmath751 .",
    "physically , this reflects the fact that , as we mentioned above , in the absence of viscosity in the strictly newtonian potential , a keplerian resonance occurs when the circular and epicyclic frequencies coincide , and perturbations in the twisted disk grow infinitely due to the action of the radial projection of the vertical pressure gradient .",
    "therefore , a stationary twist is impossible in this case . taking the next - order term in the expansion of @xmath752 in small @xmath753 into account",
    ", we obtain @xmath754 as @xmath733 , @xmath752 now remains finite at any finite @xmath531 .",
    "nevertheless , it makes the leading contribution due to relativistic effects , and all other variables in ( [ tw_stat ] ) can now be set equal to their newtonian values @xmath755 , @xmath756 , @xmath757 and @xmath758 .",
    "moreover , we neglect the weak dependence of @xmath235 on @xmath531 far from the black hole and set @xmath759 .        when @xmath531 is so large that @xmath764 , the first and second terms in ( [ sol_larger ] ) , multiplied by @xmath765 , respectively tend to a non - zero constant and to zero .",
    "this allows us to express the constant @xmath684 in terms of the value of @xmath703 at infinity , @xmath766 : @xmath767        throughout the disk the asymptotic solutions ( [ large_z ] ) and ( [ large_z1 ] ) can be matched by a wkb - solution of equation ( [ eq_invisc ] ) . indeed , because we are considering the case @xmath770 , the ratio of @xmath771 and @xmath314 in ( [ eq_invisc ] ) , @xmath772 , is large at all @xmath531 such that @xmath23 and @xmath773 are large .",
    "the wkb - solution has the form @xmath774 where the constants @xmath775 and @xmath776 should be chosen such that ( [ wkbj_sol ] ) is smoothly matched with formula ( [ large_z ] ) in the corresponding region .",
    "it can be checked that this yields @xmath777 and @xmath778 where we assume that @xmath578 and @xmath547 are taken at @xmath779 and @xmath780 near @xmath715 .",
    "next , in the limit @xmath781 we can set @xmath771 and @xmath314 before the cosine in ( [ wkbj_sol ] ) equal to their newtonian values .",
    "in addition , the integral in ( [ wkbj_sol ] ) can be represented as @xmath782 , where @xmath783 .",
    "taking into account that the newtonian value @xmath784 , we have that @xmath785 and therefore @xmath786 solution ( [ sol_wkbj_larger ] ) must be smoothly matched with expression ( [ large_z1 ] ) in the corresponding region , which yields the values of constants @xmath684 and @xmath685 .",
    "it can be checked that they are @xmath787    thus , equations ( [ bound_cond2 ] ) , ( [ wkbj_sol ] ) and ( [ sol_larger ] ) jointly with coefficients ( [ c_3 ] ) , ( [ a_1_2 ] ) and phase ( [ phi_wkbj ] ) , determine the shape of an inviscid stationary relativistic twisted disk at all distances in the range from @xmath742 to @xmath788 .",
    "we note that equations ( [ c_w0 ] ) , ( [ c_3 ] ) , ( [ a_1_2 ] ) and ( [ w_infty ] ) provide a relation between @xmath789 and @xmath766 : @xmath790 where the explicit form of @xmath791 follows from these formulas .",
    "in particular , as follows from ( [ w_infty ] ) and ( [ a_1_2 ] ) , @xmath792 .      from equations ( [ b_lam ] ) ,",
    "it is possible to represent the integral @xmath797 in the form @xmath798 , where @xmath799 does not depend on @xmath800 .",
    "this allows us to write the singular values of @xmath711 explicitly : @xmath801 where @xmath38 is an integer number .",
    "the values of @xmath802 correspond to such a balance between the external gravitomagnetic force and the internal pressure gradient in the disk that leads to the disk twist even if the matter flowing into the disk at infinity moves in the equatorial plane of the black hole .",
    "we note that the solution in the form of a flat disk lying entirely in the black hole equatorial plane , of course , also exists for these @xmath802 .",
    "this non - uniqueness of the solution disappears for any small viscosity in the disk , for which @xmath803 always implies @xmath804 . for small @xmath805 , the disk feels",
    "these resonance solutions , and its inner parts deviate significantly from the equatorial plane of the black hole , even when the outer parts of the disk lie almost in the equatorial plane .",
    "figure ( [ fig_res ] ) shows the curve corresponding to the analytical solution ( [ w_0_infty ] ) , as well as several curves for a viscous twisted disk obtained by integrating the original equation ( [ tw_stat ] ) .",

    "[ [ the - disk - behavior - on - the - plane - of - parameters - alpha - and - tildedelta ] ] the disk behavior on the plane of parameters @xmath355 and @xmath711 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    in conclusion , we present the full study of regimes of behavior of a stationary twisted relativistic disc near a rotating black hole .",
    "it is convenient to show the results of numerical integration of equation ( [ tw_stat ] ) on the plane of free parameters of the problem , @xmath711 and @xmath355 .",
    "the first parameter varies in the range @xmath807 and the second parameter varies in the range @xmath337 . as follows from fig .",
    "( [ fig_plane ] ) , at small @xmath711 , i.e. when the gravitomagnetic force exceeds the internal forces in a twisted disk , it either lies in the equatorial plane of the black hole , i.e. @xmath808 , or , conversely , the tilt of its rings strongly increases in the inner parts of the disk , with oscillations of @xmath731 along the radial coordinate .",
    "note that for small viscosity , these oscillations become so strong that the corresponding gradient of the tilt angle , @xmath809 , leads to supersonic perturbations of the velocity components , @xmath810 and @xmath613 , at heights of the order of the disk thickness , @xmath811 .",
    "this , in turn , must lead to the generation of various hydrodynamic instabilities and sound waves , which cause additional disk heating ( and hence also an increase in @xmath711 ) , as well as the growth of @xmath355 .",
    "these processes should partially suppress the oscillations of @xmath373 discussed above .",
    "the disk alignment into the equatorial plane of the black hole occurs at sufficiently high viscosity , when the condition @xmath812 is satisfied with a large margin , and is referred to as the bardeen - petterson effect @xcite .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "( [ fig_plane ] ) that this effect occurs only in sufficiently viscous and thin disks .",
    "but already for @xmath813 the ratio @xmath814 becomes of the order of unity , which means the absence of the disk alignment . at the same time , oscillations of @xmath373 disappear .",
    "figure ( [ fig_beta ] ) shows the profiles of @xmath731 when @xmath815 for several @xmath711 .",
    "it is seen that for not very small @xmath711 , the twisted disk has a sufficiently smooth shape , which suggests the possibility of the existence of such configurations in nature .",
    "we note that @xmath373 behaves non - monotonically : it first decreases and then increases with the decrease of @xmath531 .",
    "the latter can have important implications both for the disk structure itself and and for its observational manifestations .",
    "for example , the hot inner regions of such a disk should illuminate its outer parts much stronger compared to the flat disk case . clearly , this is due to the disk inner parts being tilted with respect to the outer parts .    in the region where @xmath711 is of the order of or greater than unity ,",
    "the action of the gravitomagnetic force becomes insignificant , and the disk is weakly twisted . in fig .",
    "( [ fig_plane ] ) , the area to the right of the dashed line is where @xmath731 deviates from @xmath816 by less than 10% .",
    "it is also worth noting that for @xmath817 the bardeen - petterson effect is completely absent for any @xmath355 .",
    "we have presented a detailed technical derivation of the governing equations for the evolution of the shape of a relativistic twisted disk , as well as for perturbations of the velocity and density inside it .",
    "only three simplifying assumptions have been used : the smallness of the disk aspect ratio , @xmath384 , the slowness of the black hole rotation , @xmath372 , and the smallness of the disk s rings tilt to the equatorial plane of the black hole , @xmath370 .",
    "this allowed us to formulate equations ( [ tw_phi_new ] ) , ( [ tw_r_new ] ) and ( [ tw_eq ] ) for three variables describing eulerian perturbations of the azimuthal velocity , @xmath419 and @xmath613 and the geometrical form of the disk , @xmath629 .",
    "in general , the dependence of @xmath419 and @xmath613 on the twisted coordinates @xmath44 , @xmath376 and @xmath455 , and the dependence of @xmath629 on @xmath44 and @xmath455 should be found . in accordance with equation ( [ zuw ] ) , all these variables depend harmonically on the azimuthal coordinate .",
    "the governing equations contain the profiles of the background solution , representing an accretion disk with similar radial and vertical structure but lying in the equatorial plane of the black hole .",
    "we note once again that not only the twisted disk but also the background itself can be non - stationary , because when deriving the system of equations ( [ tw_phi_new ] , [ tw_r_new ] , [ tw_eq ] ) , the only one assumption about the background , the smallness of @xmath384 , was used .",
    "therefore , the twist equations enable us also to study the evolution of tilted / twisted gaseous tori / rings near the rotating black holes as they are spreading in the radial direction , in other words , as the non - stationary accretion goes on due to turbulent viscosity .    in the particular case of a stationary , vertically isothermal background with @xmath355-parametrization of the viscosity , the twist equations have been reduced to simpler equations ( [ compl_a ] ) , ( [ compl_b ] ) and ( [ compl_w ] ) for the complex amplitudes @xmath98 and @xmath702 describing the velocity perturbations , and @xmath703 describing the disk geometry , which depend only on @xmath44 and @xmath455 . here , the solution for a flat relativistic disk , which was presented in detail in chapter 1 , was utilized .",
    "the corresponding stationary problem can be described by a second - order linear differential equation for @xmath703 ( see equation ( [ tw_stat ] ) ) .",
    "the analytic integration of this equation for a formally inviscid disk with @xmath736 enabled us to find the singular resonance solutions for a discrete set @xmath818 , which in fact correspond to an instability of a flat non - tilted disk , when the latter can acquire a twisted shape near the black hole , even with its outer part lying in the black hole equatorial plane .",
    "this instability , however , rapidly disappears already for @xmath819 and for @xmath820 provided that @xmath821 , the numerical calculations show the bardeen - petterson effect . at the same time , already for @xmath822 , the alignment of the inner parts of the disk into the equatorial plane of the black hole is absent , and for @xmath823 smooth but non - monotonic profiles @xmath392 appear ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig_beta ] ) ) , which suggests their stability under perturbations and the possibility of their realization in nature .",
    "the last effect is confirmed by the first numerical simulations of tilted thin relativistic accretion disks with @xmath824 carried out in recent papers @xcite and @xcite . in these papers , a comparison with the semi - analytic model based on the solution of the system of equations ( [ tw_phi_new ] , [ tw_r_new ] , [ tw_eq ] )",
    "was also done for a slightly tilted vertically barotropic torus .",
    "observational confirmations of the existence of twisted accretion disks around rotating black holes have just started emerging .",
    "apparently , one of the most direct pieces of evidence of their existence is the observation of maser sources at subparsec scales in the disk around a supermassive black hole in the nucleus of ngc 4258 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the subsequent modeling in @xcite and @xcite showed that the disk twist in this case can be due to the bardeen - petterson effect .",
    "in the recent paper @xcite , observations of jets in the nucleus of ngc 4248 were used to independently estimate the black hole kerr parameter @xmath825 and , in a similar model , to calculate the radius of the disk alignment into the equatorial plane of the black hole in agreement with observations .",
    "additional but more indirect arguments favoring the presence of twisted disks in galactic nuclei were obtained , for example , in @xcite and @xcite , where the observed profiles of x - ray iron line @xmath826 were calculated for different accretion disk models .",
    "it was concluded that in many cases , the observed line profile can be more easily explained in the model of the twisted disk than in the model of a flat disk but , for example , with specific radial intensity distribution . in @xcite , a similar modeling of hydrogen balmer lines",
    "was performed , which should arise due to the heating of the outer parts of a twisted disk by hard emission from its inner parts , which have much larger tilt than in the case of a flat disk .",
    "the presence of twisted disks is also suspected in binary stellar systems with black holes . for example , this can be the case in two microquasars , groj1655 - 40 and v4641 sgr , in which the tilt of jets relative to the orbital plane was discovered ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "as mentioned above , equations ( [ tw_phi_new ] ) , ( [ tw_r_new ] ) and ( [ tw_eq ] ) also describe the non - stationary dynamics of a torus tilted to the equatorial plane of a black hole .",
    "if @xmath827 , the action of the gravitomagnetic force must lead to a solid - body precession of the torus , because in this case the twisted waves propagating at almost the speed of sound smear out the dependence of @xmath439 on @xmath44 due to the lense - thirring effect .",
    "similar non - stationary models are invoked to explain the variability of balmer line profiles , as well as the precession of jets in active nuclei ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in many papers ,",
    "the precessing tori are used to explain low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations in x - ray binary systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "of special interest is the modeling of observational appearances of a tilted accretion disk around the black hole in the center of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "the theory of relativistic twisted disks presented here can also be successfully applied both to constructing self - consistent models of individual objects and to making further theoretical predictions on the dynamics of accretion flows around rotating black holes ."
