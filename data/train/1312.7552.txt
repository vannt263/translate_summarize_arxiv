    "it is well known that electron captures ( ec ) on nuclei play an important role in the dynamics of the collapsing core of a massive star that leads to a supernova explosion . near the end of their lives ,",
    "the core of a massive star ( @xmath0 ) consists predominantly of iron and its nuclear neighbors , the `` iron group '' elements .",
    "the poignant supernova explosions will lead up due to the unstable nuclear burning and iron nuclei collapse . during the pre - collapse phase",
    ", ec reduces the number of electrons available for pressure support . at the same time",
    ", the neutrinos produced by ec freely escape from the star for values of the matter density about @xmath1 , removing energy and entropy from the core .",
    "some researches show that the ec , especially for the iron group nucleus play a crucial role in the late evolution stages of massive stars . on the other hand ,",
    "electron - capture supernovae have been proposed as possible origin of elements beyond iron , in particular of heavy r - process elements . as a result",
    ", the treatment of ec significantly influences the initial conditions for the entire post - bounce evolution of the supernova .    under the supernova like explosion conditions ,",
    "the problem of ec has been an active area of investigations for many years .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite investigated the ec rates of many iron group nucleuses .",
    "in the same environment , @xcite ; @xcitealso discussed the ec rates of the iron group nucleus , but their discussions are for the case without a strong magnetic fields(hereafter smfs ) . @xcite discussed the influence of smfs on ec at zero temperature in neutron stars , which they focused only on the ground state transition of the simple nuclei and paid no attention to the gamow  teller ( gt ) transition and a number of iron group nuclei.due to the importance of smfs in astrophysical environments , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite did some works on ec and especially discussed the weak interaction reactions and neutrino energy loss on iron group nucleus .",
    "some studies show that on the surface of neutron stars , the strengths of magnetic fields are in the range of @xmath2 to @xmath3 . especially for some magnetars ,",
    "the range of smfs strengths is from @xmath3 to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "for such smfs , the classical description of the trajectories of a free electron is no longer valid and quantum effect must be considered .",
    "how would the smfs effect on the ec in magnetars ? how would the smfs effect on the cooling system in magnetars ?",
    "how would the ec affect on the evolution in magnetars ?",
    "how would the smfs affect on the fermi energy and the electron chemical potential ?",
    "how would the smfs affect on the gt transition in the ec process ?",
    "these are very interesting and challenging problems in magnetars .",
    "previous works @xcite show that smfs effect on electron capture rate and neutrino energy loss rates greatly and decreases with the increasing of the strength of magnetic field .",
    "recent studies@xcite have found , strengthened the magnetic field will make the fermi surface would elongate from a spherical surface to a landau surface along the magnetic field direction and its level is perpendicular to the magnetic field direction and quantized .",
    "thus , we have to adapt the theory of non - relativistic landau level.we will discuss the level density in detail in smfs beause the calculation on ec is strongly depended on the choice of level density .    basing on the nuclear @xmath5shell model and theory of relativity in smfs @xcite in this paper , we focus on the iron group nuclei and investigate their ec rates .",
    "we also discuss the rates of change of electronic abundance ( rcea ) due to ec in smfs .",
    "an smfs is considered along the z - axis according to theory of relativity in superstrong magnetic fields .",
    "the dirac equation can be solved exactly .",

    "we naturally draw a conclusion that the stronger the magnetic field , the higher the fermi energy of electrons .",
    "unfortunately , some works @xcite show that currently the most popular viewpoint which is the stronger the magnetic field , the lower the electron fermi energy , is completely contrary to above conclusion . in an extremely strong magnetic field ,",
    "the electrons are in disparate energy states in order one by one from the lowest energy state up to the fermi energy with the highest momentum according to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "the electron energy state in a unit volume should be equal to the electron number density .",
    "thus , the electron fermi energy is also determined by @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is avogadro constant ; @xmath32 and @xmath33 are two non - dimensional variables and defined as @xmath34 , @xmath35 , respectively ; @xmath36is the electron fermi energy .    in the case without smfs ,",

    "the strength distribution is given by @xmath79 which is related to @xmath71 by a laplace transform , @xmath80 .",
    "note that here @xmath81 is the energy transfer within the parent nucleus , and that the strength distribution @xmath82 has units of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 is the nuclear temperature .",
    "we can find the phase space factor @xmath86 in smf from refs @xcite , and it is defined as @xmath87 where @xmath88 , is the ec threshold energy ; @xmath89 , with @xmath90 and @xmath91 being the masses of the parent nucleus and the daughter nucleus respectively ; @xmath42 and @xmath76 are the excitation energies of the @xmath38 th states and @xmath39 th state of the nucleus respectively ; the @xmath92 is the total rest mass and kinetic energies ; @xmath93 is the coulomb wave correction which is the ratio of the square of the electron wave function distorted by the coulomb scattering potential to the square of wave function of the free electron .",
    "we assume that a smfs will have no effect on @xmath93 , which is valid only under the condition that the electron wave - functions are locally approximated by the plane - wave functions .",
    "@xcite the condition requires that the fermi wavelength @xmath94 ( @xmath95 is the fermi momentum without a magnetic field ) be smaller than the radius @xmath96 ( where @xmath97 ) of the cylinder which corresponds to the lowest landau level . @xcite",

    "thus , there are some difference among our rates , ffn s and afud s . in order to compared our results with those of ffn s and aufd s in the case without smfs , the scale factor @xmath102 and @xmath103 are defined as follows @xmath104 @xmath105    on the other hand , what really matters for stellar evolution is the electronic abundance @xmath106 , the rate of change of electronic abundance ( rcea ) caused by each nucleus .",
    "therefore , the rcea due to ec on the @xmath27 th nucleus is very important in smfs .",
    "it is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the mass fraction of the @xmath27 th nucleus and @xmath109 is the mass number of the @xmath27 th nucleus .",
    "the electron chemical potential is a very sensitivity parameter in the process of ec .",
    "figures 15 show the ec rates of some iron group nuclei as a function of @xmath29 under the condition of @xmath110 ; @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( @xmath113 is the temperature in units of @xmath114 ) .",
    "one sees that at relative lower density the electron chemical potential has a relative minor effect on the ec rates for most nuclides .",
    "but the ec rates of most nuclides are influenced greatly at relative higher density .",
    "for example , for most iron group nuclei ( e.g.@xmath115co and @xmath116ni ) , the ec rates increased no more than by four and six orders of magnitude at @xmath112 , @xmath117 and @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , one can see that as increasing of smfs , the higher the density , the smaller the influence on ec is , because the electron energy and @xmath29 are very large at higher density surroundings and the higher landau levels are occupied by electrons . according to theory of relativity in smfs , with increasing of the magnetic fields at relative higher density , @xmath29 increases greatly , and the lower smfs effects .",
    "it is because that in an extremely strong magnetic field ( @xmath16 ) , the landau column becomes a very long and very narrow cylinder along the magnetic field , the electron chemical potential and electron energy are so strongly dependent on the density .",
    "for example , according our calculations , with increasing of the magnetic fields from @xmath3 to @xmath118 , the electron chemical potential increases from @xmath119 to @xmath120 at @xmath121 and from @xmath122 to @xmath123 at @xmath124 ( @xmath125 is the density in units of @xmath126 )     fe as a function of the electron chemical potential at the density and temperature of @xmath117 ; @xmath111 and @xmath112,title=\"fig:\",width=151,height=151 ]   fe as a function of the electron chemical potential at the density and temperature of @xmath117 ; @xmath111 and @xmath112,title=\"fig:\",width=151,height=151 ]     co as a function of the electron chemical potential at the density and temperature of @xmath117 ; @xmath111 and @xmath112,title=\"fig:\",width=151,height=151 ]   co as a function of the electron chemical potential at the density and temperature of @xmath117 ; @xmath111 and @xmath112,title=\"fig:\",width=151,height=151 ]     ni as a function of the electron chemical potential at the density and temperature of @xmath117 ; @xmath111 and @xmath112,title=\"fig:\",width=151,height=151 ]   ni as a function of the electron chemical potential at the density and temperature of @xmath117 ; @xmath111 and @xmath112,title=\"fig:\",width=151,height=151 ]     mn as a function of the electron chemical potential at the density and temperature of @xmath117 ; @xmath111 and @xmath112,title=\"fig:\",width=151,height=151 ]   mn as a function of the electron chemical potential at the density and temperature of @xmath117 ; @xmath111 and @xmath112,title=\"fig:\",width=151,height=151 ]     cr as a function of the electron chemical potential at the density and temperature of @xmath117 ; @xmath111 and @xmath112,title=\"fig:\",width=151,height=151 ]   cr as a function of the electron chemical potential at the density and temperature of @xmath117 ; @xmath111 and @xmath112,title=\"fig:\",width=151,height=151 ]    figures 610 show the ec rates of some iron group nuclei as a function of the magnetic fields @xmath127 under the condition of @xmath128 ; @xmath129 and @xmath130 respectively .",
    "we find that the ec rates of most nuclides influenced greatly at relative lower temperature and density .",
    "for example , for most iron group nuclei ( e.g. @xmath115 co and @xmath116ni ) , the ec rates increase and even exceed by four orders of magnitude at @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "however , at @xmath129 and @xmath133 the increase is no more than by three orders of magnitude .    comparing the results in these figures",
    ", it can be seen that the gt transition process of the ec process may not be dominant at lower temperature .",
    "this process is dominated by the low - energy transition . therefore , the effect produced by this kind of densities is not very obvious in smfs .",
    "we find that the distribution of the electron gas with high temperature and high density must satisfy the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "the gt transition strength of nuclide is distributed in the form of the centrosymmetric gaussian function about the gt resonance point .",
    "so the energies of the electrons taking part in the gt resonance transitions in the high  energy range are not symmetric in smfs .",
    "the distribution of gaussian function increases and includes more electrons to take part in the electron capture reactions .",
    "therefore , with increasing of the temperature , it obviously accelerates the progress of the electron capture process .",
    "it inevitably leads to great increases of the ec rates .",

    "the reason is that the fermi energy of electrons increases with the smfs increasing and it may lead to more and more electrons whose energy is above the threshold for ec process .",

    "ffn had done some pioneer works on ec rates . in order to understand how much ec",

    "all seven @xmath5 protons are filled in the @xmath159 orbital and thus the only allowed gt transitions are to the @xmath159 and @xmath160 neutron orbitals .",
    "the formal orbital is blocked by neutrons .",
    "thus a @xmath159 proton has become a @xmath160 neutron .    on the other hand , the charge exchange reactions ( p , n ) and ( n",

    "for some iron nuclides the experimental information is particularly rich and the availability of both @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "it makes possible to study in detail the problem of renormalization of @xmath163 operators .",

    "an average of the gt strength distribution is in fact obtained by smmc method .",
    "the electron capture of the neutron rich nuclide do not has measured mass , so that the ec q - value has to be estimated with a mass formal by ffn .",
    "ffn used the @xcite semiempirical atomic mass formula , so that the q - value used in the effective rates are quite different . on the basis of the independent particle model , ffn parametrized the gt contribution to the ec rates . to complete the ffn rate estimate ,",

    "basing on nuclear shell model , aufd expanded the ffn s works and analyzed the nuclear excited level by a simple calculation on the nuclear excitation level transitions in their works .",

    "it is generally known that the ec rate is easily calculated as long as the distribution of nuclear excited states is clear .",
    "but it is very difficult to know the distribution because a lot of nuclear excited states are not stable at the stage of supernova explosive .",
    "the experimental data on gt distribution within the nucleus becomes available .",
    "these data show that the ec value of the ffn s works @xcite , which using the gt contribution parameters have large errors .",
    "these data clearly show that the gt strength disappear in the daughter nucleus and split into several excitation .",
    "aufd analyze the nuclear excited level by a simple calculation on the nuclear excitation level transitions in their works .",
    "the excited state is splinted up into the ground state near the low energy parts and resonant states near the high - energy parts respectively . therefore , the capture rates are made up of the lower energy transition rates between the ground states and the higher energy transition rates between gt resonance states",
    ". therefore the works of aufd is an oversimplification and the accuracy is limited .",
    "as everyone knows , the problems about the influence of a strong magnetic field on electron capture in non - zero temperature crusts of neutron stars have already been discussed by @xcite ; @xcite .",
    "their results show that the magnetic fields ( @xmath167 ) on surfaces of neutron stars have almost no effect on the electron capture rate . in this paper , we have carried out estimation for ec rates and rcea of iron group nuclei in smfs which is ranging from @xmath3 to @xmath118 .",
    "it is concluded that an smfs has a significant effect on them for most iron group nuclides .",
    "we also compare our results with those of ffn s and aufd s for the case with and without smfs .",
    "the results show that our results is in well agreement with aufd s , but the ffn s are about close to one order magnitude bigger than ours for the case without smfs . on contrary ,",
    "our calculated rates for most nuclides in smfs are increased and even exceeded as much as by nine and eight orders of magnitude bigger than ffn s and aufd s , which are in case without smfs , respectively .    as is known to all",
    ", the research on ec reaction at late stages of stellar evolution will still be a long - term and arduous task .",
    "it will have a key and profound significance to better understand and study the final evolutionary paths and nuclear interaction model of cosmic objects , as well as the physical structure and state in the interiors of celestial objects in the environment of high temperature , high pressure , high magnetic fields and high density .",
    "our conclusions may be helpful to the investigation of the late evolution of the neutron stars and magnetars , the nucleosyntheses of heavy elements and the numerical calculations of stellar evolution .",
