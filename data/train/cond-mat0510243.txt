    "<S> the rsoi splits each parabolic energy subband of a 2deg into two nonparabolic spin branches and affects the electronic many - body correlation and dielectric properties of the 2deg . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the rsoi on the 2deg plasmon spectrum in single quantum wells appear mainly in three ways : 1 ) an overall frequency lowering due to the energy band deformation ; 2 ) a weak frequency oscillation stemming from the spin - split energy band ; and 3)an enhancement of the landau damping as a result of the emerging of the inter - branch single - particle - excitation spectrum . in double quantum wells , </S>",
    "<S> the above effects are enhanced for the optic plasmon mode but diminished for the acoustic one . </S>"
