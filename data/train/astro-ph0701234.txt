    "the chemical property of interstellar gas is important to trace the chemical evolutionary status of galaxy .",
    "accurate abundance measurements for the ionized gas in galaxies require the determination of the electron temperature ( @xmath4 ) , which is usually able to be measured in metal - poor environments since the needed auroral line [ o  iii]@xmath54363 can only be detected there .",
    "the common method to estimate the oxygen abundances of metal - rich galaxies ( 12+log(o / h)@xmath68.5 ) is using empirical strong - line ratios , such as @xmath3 , @xmath1 , [ n ii]/h@xmath7 etc .",
    "( kobulnicky et al . 1999 ; liang et al . 2006 ; yin et al .",
    "2006 , y06 ) . at present ,",
    "the @xmath1 method ( pilyugin et al . 2001 , 2005 , as p01 , p05 ) is widely used since the derived ( o / h ) abundances are consistent with those derived from @xmath4 ( p05 ; y06 ) .",
    "this is specially interesting for metal - rich galaxies .",
    "however , the derived abundances from p01 and p05 show some discrepancy , which has been shown by about hundred h  ii regions by p05 . here",
    "we select a much larger sample of @xmath020,000 metal - rich star - forming galaxies from the sdss - dr2 database to study this effect in more details .",
    "moreover , we specially compare the abundances derived from the revised @xmath1 method given by p05 with the bayesian abundances obtained by tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for these sdss galaxies .",
    "the selected sample galaxies have 12+log(o / h@xmath8 8.5 and 12+log(o / h@xmath9 8.25 , which guarantee they are in the upper branch of metallicity .",
    "previously , p01 gave the @xmath1 calibration formula for metal - rich galaxies on the basis of @xmath040 h  ii regions .",
    "p05 revised this calibration by using an extended sample , about 104 h  ii regions .",
    "p05 has shown the difference between these two calibrations . here",
    "we use a much larger sample to study this discrepancy .",
    "figs.1a - c show the large discrepancy between the two derived abundances from p01 s and p05 s calibrations , and the relations of this discrepancy with log(@xmath3 ) and @xmath2 .",
    "then , we also study the large discrepancies between the bayesian abundances and those derived from p05 s calibration , and their relations with log(@xmath3 ) and @xmath2 ( figs.1d - f ) .",
