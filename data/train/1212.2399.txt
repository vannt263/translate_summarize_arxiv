    "kinetically constrained spin models ( kcms ) are interacting @xmath0-@xmath1 particle systems on general graphs evolving with a simple glauber dynamics which can be described as follows . at every vertex",
    "@xmath18 the system tries to update the occupancy variable ( or spin ) at @xmath18 to the value @xmath1 or @xmath0 with probability @xmath19 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "however the update at @xmath18 is accepted only if a certain local contraint is verified by the _",
    "current _ spin configuration . that explains",
    "the wording `` kinetically constrained '' .",
    "the constraint at site @xmath18 is always assumed not to depend on the spin at @xmath18 and therefore the product bernoulli(@xmath19 ) measure @xmath20 is the reversible measure .",
    "typical constraints require , for example , that a certain number of the neighboring spins are in state @xmath0 , or more restrictive , that certain _ preassigned _ neighboring spins are in state @xmath0 ( e.g. the children of @xmath18 when the underlying graph is a rooted tree ) .",
    "the main interest in the physical literature for kcms ( see e.g. @xcite ) stems from the fact that they display many key dynamical features of real glassy materials : ergodicity breaking transition at some critical value @xmath21 , huge relaxation time for @xmath3 close to @xmath21 , dynamic heterogeneity ( non - trivial spatio - temporal fluctuations of the local relaxation to equilibrium ) and aging just to mention a few .",
    "mathematically , despite of their simple definition , kcms pose very challenging and interesting problems because of the hardness of the constraint , with ramifications towards bootstrap percolation problems @xcite , combinatorics @xcite , coalescence processes @xcite and random walks on triangular matrices @xcite .",
    "some of the mathematical tools developed for the analysis of the relaxation process of kcms proved to be quite powerful also in other contexts such as card shuffling problems @xcite and random evolution of surfaces @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze one of the most popular kcms namely , the east model ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) , which consists of a linear chain ( finite or infinite ) of @xmath0-@xmath1 spins evolving under a simple glauber dynamics in the presence of the kinetic constraint which forbids flips of those spins whose left neighbor is in state @xmath1 . to avoid trivial irreducibility issues",
    "when the chain is either finite or semi - infinite , one always assumes that the leftmost spin is unconstrained .",
    "it is known that the relaxation time ( cf . ) of the east model is uniformly bounded in the length @xmath5 of the chain @xcite and that , because of the constraints , it diverges very rapidly as @xmath22 ( cf . prop .",
    "[ prem ] below ) .",
    "the mixing time ( cf . ) instead diverges linearly in @xmath5 .",
    "it is also known @xcite that , starting from a large class of initial laws ( e.g. a non - trivial bernoulli@xmath23 product measure , @xmath24 ) , the expected value at time @xmath25 of a local function @xmath26 converges exponentially fast to @xmath27 , the mean of @xmath26 w.r.t . the reversible measure @xmath20 .",
    "these results prove , in a broad sense , exponential relaxation to equilibrium for time scales _ larger _ than the relaxation time for the infinite chain .",
    "however the most interesting and challenging dynamical behavior , featuring aging and dynamic heterogeneity , occurs for @xmath28 on time scales _ shorter _ than the relaxation time .",
    "building upon the non - rigorous picture in the physics literature @xcite but going well beyond it , it was proved in @xcite that , for all @xmath29 independent of @xmath3 , the dynamics of the infinite east chain in a space window @xmath30 $ ] and up to time scales @xmath31 is well approximated , as @xmath2 , by a certain _ hierarchical coalescence process _ ( hcp ) @xcite . in this",
    "hcp vacancies are isolated and domains ( maximal blocks of the form @xmath14 ) with cardinality between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , coalesce with the domain at their right only at time scale @xmath35 . as a result ,",
    "aging and dynamic heterogeneity in the above regime emerge in a natural way , with a scaling limit for the relevant quantities in the same universality class as several other mean field coalescence models of statistical physics @xcite .",
    "however the above result says nothing about the dynamics and its characteristic time scales at intermediate ( mesoscopic ) length scales @xmath36 , @xmath37 , or at the typical inter - vacancy equilibrium scale @xmath38 . as clarified later on ( cf .",
    "section [ heuristic ] ) , at these length scales the low temperature dynamics of the east model is no longer predominantly driven by an effective energy landscape as in @xcite , but entropic effects become crucial and a subtle entropy / energy competition comes into play . in the physical literature",
    "these effects have been neglected and the characteristic time scale @xmath39 , appropriate for domains of length @xmath40 , @xmath41 , has been extrapolated up to the equilibrium scale @xmath42 leading for example to the wrong prediction of a relaxation time @xmath43 ( to be compared with the bounds given in theorem [ paletti ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we analyse the low temperature dynamics in the above setting .",
    "we first show ( cf .",
    "theorem [ equo ] ) that three natural characteristic time scales of the east model of length @xmath4 have a similar scaling as @xmath2 .",
    "this equivalence is important because of various notions of `` relaxation time '' which appear in the physical literature .",
    "secondly we prove a sharp separation of time scales and dynamic heterogeneity ( cf .",
    "theorems [ bubu ] and [ hetero ] ) at mesoscopic length scale @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "a key ingredient for the above results is a novel and detailed computation of the relaxation time of finite east chains as @xmath2 , in which the entropic contributions in the upper and lower bounds are pinned down very precisely ( cf .",
    "theorem [ paletti ] ) .",
    "the upper bound is obtained via a substantial refinement of the inductive technique first introduced in @xcite .",
    "instead the lower bound has been inspired by capacity methods and is obtained via a novel construction in the configuration space of a bottleneck .",
    "the equilibrium weight of the bottleneck is computed in an algorithmic fashion .    in theorem [ sorpresa ]",
    "we also prove that no time scale separation occurs for @xmath16 , _",
    "i.e. _ at the equilibrium scale @xmath38 .",
    "this precludes the time scale separation hypothesis in @xcite , put forward on the basis of numerical simulations , which was a keystone of the _ super - domain dynamics _ formulation .",
    "this is an example of a case in which numerical simulations can be misleading because of the extremely long time scales involved , emphasizing the need for rigorous work .",
    "the above results combined with the hierarchical coalescence picture of @xcite complete somehow the picture of the non - equilibrium dynamics of the east model up to the equilibrium scale @xmath38 .",
    "the question of a mathematically rigorous description of the stationary dynamics , for which the typical domain has length proportional to @xmath38 , remains open . in their seminal paper",
    "@xcite aldous and diaconis proposed the following very appealing conjecture .",
    "as @xmath2 the vacancies of the stationary east process in @xmath44 , after rescaling space by @xmath3 and speeding up the process by the relaxation time , converge to a limit point process @xmath45 on @xmath44 which can be described as follows : + ( i ) at fixed time @xmath25 , @xmath45 is a poisson point process of rate @xmath1 .",
    "+ ( ii ) for each @xmath46 , with a positive rate depending on @xmath47 each particle deletes all particles to its right up to a distance @xmath47 and replaces them by new sample of the poisson process .    proving the conjecture is certainly one of the challenging open problems for the model .",
    "we will consider a reversible interacting particle system on finite intervals @xmath48 of @xmath49 of the form @xmath50 ( for shortness @xmath51 $ ] if clear from the context ) with glauber type dynamics on the configuration space @xmath52 , reversible with respect to the product probability measure @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the bernoulli@xmath55 measure .",
    "since we are interested in the small @xmath3 regime throughout the paper we will assume @xmath56 .",
    "[ temp ] sometimes in the physical literature the parameter @xmath3 is written as @xmath57 , @xmath58 being proportional to the inverse temperature , so that the limit @xmath2 corresponds to the zero temperature limit .",
    "elements of @xmath59 will usually be denoted by the greek letters @xmath60 and @xmath61 will denote the occupancy variable at the site @xmath18 .",
    "the configuration after flipping the spin on site @xmath18 will be denoted by @xmath62 , @xmath63 the restriction of a configuration @xmath64 to a subset @xmath65 of @xmath48 will be denoted by @xmath66 . in the sequel it will be useful to use the convention that @xmath67 , there is a fixed vacancy on the left of the interval .",
    "the east process ( a continuous time markov chain ) can be informally described as follows .",
    "each vertex @xmath68 waits an independent mean one exponential time and then , provided that the current configuration @xmath69 satisfies the constraint @xmath70 , the value of @xmath71 at @xmath18 is refreshed and set equal to @xmath1 with probability @xmath19 and to @xmath0 with probability @xmath3 .",
    "the leftmost vertex @xmath72 is unconstrained .",
    "two configurations @xmath73 are said to be neighbors under the east dynamics if there is a non - zero probability rate @xmath74 of making a transition directly between them .",
    "therefore two configurations @xmath73 are neighbors if they differ only in a single coordinate @xmath18 and for this coordinate @xmath75 .    sometimes in the literature one refers to the east process as the above process but with the constraint at @xmath18 satisfied iff the vertex immediately to _ right _ of @xmath18 is empty .",
    "of course the two processes are equivalent under the mapping @xmath76 .",

    "we recall a standard graphical construction which defines on the same probability space the finite volume east process for _ all _ initial conditions . using a standard percolation argument @xcite together with the fact that the constraints @xmath98 are uniformly bounded and of finite range , it is not difficult to see that the graphical construction can be extended without problems also to the infinite volume case .    to each @xmath99",
    "we associate a mean one poisson process and , independently , a family of independent bernoulli@xmath55 random variables @xmath100 .",
    "the occurrences of the poisson process associated to @xmath18 will be denoted by @xmath101 .",
    "we assume independence as @xmath18 varies in @xmath48 . notice that with probability one all the occurrences @xmath102 are different .",
    "this defines the probability space .",
    "the corresponding probability measure will be denoted by @xmath103 .    given @xmath104 we construct a continuous time markov chain @xmath105 on the above probability space , starting at @xmath88 from @xmath106 , according to the following rules .",
    "at each time @xmath107 the site @xmath18 queries the state of its own constraint @xmath98 .",

    "the configuration resets its value at site @xmath18 to the value of the corresponding bernoulli variable @xmath109 .",
    "it is easy to check that the above construction actually gives a continuous time markov chain with generator .",
    "we will refer in the sequel to the above construction as the _ basic coupling _ for the process .",
    "notice that the rings and coin tosses at @xmath18 for @xmath110 have no influence whatsoever on the evolution of the configuration at the site @xmath111 which determines the constraint @xmath112 and thus they have no influence of whether a ring at @xmath18 for @xmath113 is legal or not .",
    "a first immediate consequence of the construction is the following characterization of the _ coupling _ time of the chain . starting from @xmath114",

    "then elementary induction gives that , for any @xmath99 , any @xmath106 and any @xmath116 , @xmath117 in particular @xmath118 the second consequence of the basic coupling is the following property ( see @xcite*lemma 2.2 ) .",

    "it turns out that this problem is quite non - trivial because of a rather subtle interplay between the contribution to the relaxation time coming from energy barriers and the contribution due to the entropy ( _ i.e _ the number of ways of overcoming the energy barrier ) .",

    "of course this process must necessarily occur in a kind of cooperative way because , in order to remove a vacancy , other vacancies must be created nearby ( to its left ) .",
