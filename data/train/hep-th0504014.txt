    "it is well known that theories which are believed as fundamental , i.e. the string theory , are formulated in multidimensional spaces .",
    "for this reason there has been a great interest in field theory models with more than three spatial dimensions . the standard way to retain four - dimensional physics in multidimensional - models",
    "is to assume that the extra dimensions are compactified to a large scale @xmath6 .",
    "however , in resent years , there is an alternative scenario which has attracted attention .",
    "this scenario is based on the idea according to which we are trapped in a submanifold with three spatial dimensions ( brane world ) that is embedded in a fundamental multi - dimensional manifold ( bulk ) .",
    "a new feature of this scenario , is that it allows the extra dimensions to be large or even infinite .",
    "in this paper we will concentrate our attention on the interesting case of the rs2-brane world scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this variation of the brane world scenario",
    ", we have a single brane with a positive energy density ( the tension @xmath7 ) and a negative , fine - tuned , five dimensional cosmological constant @xmath8 .",
    "this model implies a non - factorizable space time geometry of the form of @xmath9 around the brane ( see eq .",
    "( 5 ) below ) .",
    "the four - dimensional particles , in this model , are expected to be gravitationally trapped on the brane .",
    "we see in refs . @xcite that gravitons and scalar fields exhibit a normalizable zero mode plus a continuous spectrum .",
    "unfortunately there is no normalizable zero mode in the case of fermions and gauge fields ) .",
    "gauge fields are localized neither on a brane with positive tension nor on a brane with negative tension . ] , for the rs2-model , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    according to the above discussion , for achieving localization of the fermion or gauge field we must invoke an alternative scenario or an alternative mechanism .",
    "there are several variation of the brane world scenario , with different geometries than that of the rs2-model ( different warp factors ) or with more than five dimensions , or even in flat space time with topological defects , where the fermion or gauge field localization has been achieved , see refs . @xcite and references there in .",
    "however , as it is emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , the most difficult task is the massless non - abelian gauge field localization on the brane , as any acceptable mechanism for this must preserve the charge universality .",
    "a non gravitational mechanism , which seems to solve this problem in a clever way , is the dvali - shifman mechanism of ref .",
    "this mechanism is based on the idea of the construction of a gauge field model which exhibits a non - confinement phase on the brane and a confinement phase on the bulk .",
    "thus gauge fields , and more generally fermions and bosons with gauge charge ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , can not escape into the bulk unless we give them energy greater than the mass gap @xmath10 , which emerges from the nunpurturbative confining dynamics of the gauge field model in the bulk .",
    "for criticism or a better insight on this mechanism see refs . @xcite . also , the dvali - shifman mechanism in the case of conformal matter has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    from the point of view of lattice",
    ", it is worth to note that there are some models with anisotropic couplings , in multi - dimensional spaces , that exhibit a new phase , the layer phase as it is named .",
    "the main feature of the layer phase is a non - confinement phase along the layer combined with a confinement along the extra dimensions .",
    "the idea of the layer phase was originated by fu and nielsen , in ref .",
    "recent research aiming at the investigation of the layer phase for several models with anisotropic coupling , as a way to achieve non - abelian gauge field localization , can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . particularly , in ref .",
    "@xcite the anisotropic su(2 ) adjoint higgs model is analyzed .",
    "in addition , the u(1 ) model in the rs - background is analyzed in ref .",
    "we see that the lattice results indicate a layer phase for both of these models .",
    "in this paper we aim at the construction of a model where the dvali - shifman mechanism is triggered by the geometry of the multidimensional space time , and not by an auxiliary neutral scalar field which forms a kink topological defect toward the extra dimension , as is done in the original paper of ref .",
    "for this we have considered an su(2 ) gauge field model with a scalar triplet , in the rs - geometry . in this model",
    "we have included a possible interaction term of the form @xmath11 , see refs .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath3 is a dimensionless numerical factor . in section 4",
    "we study how the spectrum of the scalar field is modified when this additional interaction turns on .",
    "we see that the zero mode , for @xmath2 , turns into a tachyon mode ( a normalizable bound state with negative energy ) , in the case of a nonzero negative value of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the tachyon mode implies an instability of the @xmath5 vacuum against a new stable vacuum for the scalar field , which is described by a @xmath12 configuration with nonvanishing value for @xmath0 near the brane ( @xmath13 is the extra dimension ) .",
    "thus , in the background of this stable configuration for the scalar field , the gauge symmetry is valid in the bulk ( confinement phase ) , but it is spontaneously broken on the brane ( non - confinement phase ) .",
    "it is worth to note that in refs .",
    "@xcite the same non minimally coupled model is considered , for four dimensions in the case of de sitter space - time .",
    "it is obtained that for a specific range of values of @xmath3 the scalar field is rendered unstable , and this result have straightforward implications to the cosmological constant problem .",
    "the philosophy of our paper is quite closely to that of the previous works of refs .",
    "however there are some important differences , as in the present work we study the five dimensional space - time in the present of the rs - metric , and we use our results in order to argue for the localization of the gauge fields on the brane .",
    "we consider an su(2 ) gauge field model with a scalar triplet @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , in the adjoint representation , in the presence of gravity .",
    "the action of this model is : @xmath16 the volume element is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the infinite extra dimension . in what will follow we set @xmath19 .",
    "the lagrangian for gravity is chosen to be identical with that of the randall - sundrum model @xcite , which is given by the equation @xmath20 where @xmath7 is the brane tension , @xmath8 is the five - dimensional cosmological constant , and @xmath21 is the five - dimensional newton s constant . in addition",
    "@xmath22 is the five dimensional ricci scalar , @xmath23 is the determinant of the five dimensional metric tensor @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 is the determinant of the metric tensor on the brane , which is defined by the equation @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) . for the signature of the metric @xmath24 we adopt the convention @xmath29 , and for the sign of the curvature tensor we adopt the convention of ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the lagrangians for the gauge field and the scalar field , in curved space - time , are @xmath31 in what follows we assume that @xmath32 , or we assume that there is not a mass term . also we have used the notation @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in addition",
    "the covariant derivative in the adjoint representation is @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the five - dimensional gauge coupling .    if we chose @xmath39 , the corresponding equations of motion of the lagrangian of eq .",

    "we aim to investigate the effects of a possible additional interaction term between the scalar field and the gravity , of the form @xmath43 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , where @xmath3 is a dimensionless numerical factor .",
    "then @xmath44 is modified as @xmath45 note that eq .",
    "( 5 ) remains a solution of the equations of motion even for @xmath46 .",
    "the spectrum of the massless scalar field , around the stable solution of eq .",
    "( 5 ) for @xmath2 , consists of a zero - mode plus a continuous tower of states ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in section 4",
    "we will show analytically that the zero mode for @xmath2 , turns into tachyon mode ( a normalizable bound state with negative energy ) , in the case of a nonzero negative value of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the existence of a localized tachyon mode around @xmath47 , when we turn on the interaction term @xmath48 , renders the solution of eq .",
    "( 5 ) unstable . due to the instability",
    ", the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field can not be zero everywhere anymore .",
    "the scalar field vacuum will be a function of @xmath13 , which form is expected to be similar with that of the tachyon mode , see eq .",
    "( 32 ) in section 4 .",
    "this suggests a nonzero value for @xmath49 near the brane , which tends rapidly to zero , outside in the bulk .",
    "note , that the nonzero value of the scalar field near the brane is stabilized by the interaction term @xmath50 .",
    "now will try to give a brief description of the new stable metric of the nonminimally coupled theory with negative @xmath3 . in this case the new stable metric",
    "is expected to be of the form of eq . ( 5 ) ( or eq .",
    "however , the behavior of the warp factor is not given by the equation @xmath41 anymore .",
    "the exact form for @xmath51 can be found only if we solve the system of the equations of motion for the lagrangian of the system ( see eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 2 ) ) with two unknown functions @xmath51 and @xmath12 and the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "note that as @xmath52 for @xmath53 , the warp factor for @xmath54 must be of the form @xmath41 or @xmath55 , as these two functions satisfy the equations of motion if we set @xmath56 .",
    "otherwise in this paper we have not determined analytically or numerically the metric of the new stable solution , and we have left this problem for future investigation .",
    "however , in order to estimate quantitatively the scalar field vacuum as a function of z we will assume that the rs - metric is fixed `` by hand '' .",
    "we have solved numerically the equation of motion which corresponds to the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( 6 ) for @xmath4 , in the background of the rs - metric , and we have plotted our results in fig . [ 1 ] for @xmath57 , as @xmath58 .",
    "we see that indeed the scalar field vacuum is nonzero on the brane and zero in the bulk , as expected from the behavior of ricci scalar r versus @xmath13 ( or @xmath59 ) ( for details see the next section ) .",
    "in particular , we solved numerically the ordinary differential equation : @xmath60 for @xmath61 , with the boundary conditions @xmath62 the first boundary condition comes from the @xmath63 term in riccy scalar r of eq .",
    "( 12 ) below .",
    "in addition , we emphasize that the potential term @xmath50 is necessary in order to achieve a behavior like that of fig .",
    "[ 1 ] .    in the framework of the above discussion we can argue in favor of a possible scenario for the gauge field localization on the rs2-brane world .",
    "the nonzero value of @xmath64 field , for @xmath65 , implies a non - confinement phase on the brane ( or the su(2 ) symmetry is spontaneously broken to u(1 ) on the brane ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the zero value of @xmath64 outside the brane implies a confinement phase into the bulk , ( or the su(2 ) symmetry is restored in the bulk ) . in this way the gauge field of u(1 ) theory ( photon ) is localized on the brane , as for escaping in the bulk , it requires energy equal to @xmath66 , where @xmath66 is the mass gap emerging from the nonperturbative confining dynamics of the su(2 ) gauge field theory , in the bulk .",
    "note , that in principle , the same mechanism can be used for a model with an arbitrary gauge group @xmath67 in the bulk which breaks to a subgroup @xmath68 on the brane .",
    "similarly , the gauge fields related to @xmath68 are localized on the brane and are separated by a mass gap @xmath66 from the bulk modes , which are massive because of confinement ( also see refs .",
