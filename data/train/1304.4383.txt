    "of the most important and intrinsic features of the wireless networks is fading .",
    "this phenomenon induces many adverse effects in the networks , and considerably reduces the performance .",
    "diversity is a well - known technique to deal with fading , which is used in the various domains such as time , frequency , and space .",
    "cooperative relay - based networks have been proposed to combat fading , by benefiting from the spatial diversity through the relays or the antennas of a multi - antenna relay @xcite .",
    "the traditional cooperative transmission schemes , such as amplify - and - forward ( af ) and decode - and - forward ( df ) , have been introduced and evaluated in the the numerous papers like @xcite .",
    "the basic and common shortcoming of these schemes is the reduction of the network throughput in the multi - sources networks @xcite . to eliminate this problem",
    ", the idea of using network coding in the cooperative networks has been suggested in the recent years .",
    "network coding was first introduced by ahlswede et al . in the seminal work @xcite , and then proposed as linear network coding ( lnc ) in @xcite . the main idea of",
    "the lnc is that in a multi - hop network , the intermediate nodes combine linearly the received data from the source nodes , and transmit them to the next hops , instead of transmitting each received data separately .",
    "this approach can dramatically reduce the delay , and consequently , increase the network throughput .",
    "the initial researches on network coding were related to the wired networks , but it was gradually generalized to the wireless networks @xcite .",
    "the network codes were first considered in the network layer with the assumption of an ideal and error - free physical layer , but afterwards were extended to the physical layer by considering the effects of fading and noise .",
    "the most spectrally efficient physical layer network coding ( plnc ) was proposed in @xcite , in which the nodes simultaneously transmit their own data , and the other nodes receive the linear combinations of the data transmitted plus the noise during just one time slot ; nonetheless , a high level of synchronization must be hold in order this scheme to be viable .",
    "recently , the network coding has been exploited in the cooperative relay networks due to its capability to increase the network throughput .",
    "quite a few of these works have somehow demonstrated that utilizing the linear network coding in the multi - source cooperative networks instead of the traditional schemes leads to the same diversity order , while improves the network throughput .",
    "@xcite has investigated the network coding in a double - source cooperative network , where each node creates a linear combination of its own symbol and its partner s correctly decoded symbol on @xmath5 . in @xcite , a cooperative transmission scheme",
    "based on the network coding along with the multi - user detection has been proposed to improve the users bit error rate ( ber ) .",
    "@xcite has introduced a cooperative scheme based on the network coding and the best relay selection technique in a network with @xmath0 source - destination pairs and @xmath1 intermediate relays . in @xcite ,",
    "each destination must correctly decode the other sources symbols in order to recover its own symbol , and without this assumption the diversity order decreases from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "the aforementioned papers have used the binary field @xmath5 to build the linear combinations . nevertheless , some papers considered using the higher fields @xmath8 .",
    "specifically , @xcite showed that in the multi - source networks with the error - prone source - relay channels , the network coding on @xmath5 can not lead to the full diversity order .",
    "furthermore , @xcite considered a network with @xmath1 sources where each source acts as a relay for the other sources , and a @xmath9 maximum distance separable ( mds ) linear block code is utilized by the relays .",
    "the scheme of @xcite leads to the network throughput equal to @xmath10 symbol per channel use ( spcu ) and diversity order of @xmath11 .",
    "although based on the singleton bound @xcite , the diversity order of @xmath12 was expected in @xcite , but due to the error possibility in the inter - source channels this expectation had not been realized .",
    "@xcite has generalized the idea of @xcite , in which a @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) mds linear block code is used as the network coding matrix , which leads to the improved singleton bound @xmath15 with the same throughput of @xmath10 spcu .",
    "although these schemes have boosted the diversity order , but they are still suffering from low network throughput . to address this problem ,",
    "@xcite has introduced complex field network coding ( cfnc ) scheme in a network including @xmath0 sources , which reaches to the diversity order of @xmath0 , as well as the network throughput of approximately @xmath16 spcu . in @xcite",
    ", the cfnc has been also utilized in a network including @xmath17 sources , @xmath18 relays , and one common destination , which reaches to the full diversity order of @xmath19 along with the network throughput of @xmath20 symbol per source per channel use ( spspcu ) ( or equivalently @xmath21 spcu ) , while the network throughput of the traditional ( af and df ) and the finite field linear network coding schemes in such a network are respectively equal to @xmath22 spcu and @xmath23 spcu .",
    "the main reason for the higher throughput of the cfnc schemes in @xcite and @xcite is the utilization of the complex fields instead of the finite fields , in which the symbols of different nodes , similar to the plnc , are simultaneously transmitted and their linear combinations in the complex field are received in the other nodes ; as a result , this scheme possesses highly complicated synchronization concerns of the plnc .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , a cooperative transmission scheme based on the linear network codes designed over @xmath8 has been introduced for improving the diversity - multiplexing trade - off ( dmt ) in a network consisting of @xmath0 source - destination pairs , and @xmath1 intermediate relays , which reaches the full diversity order of @xmath6 as well as the network throughput of @xmath24 spcu . in @xcite ,",
    "the parity check matrix of a @xmath25 mds linear block code is used as the network coding matrix .",
    "however , the field size required for such mds codes increases exponentially with the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which can significantly enhance the system complexity .    in this paper , to increase the diversity order without the degradation of the network throughput , we propose a new cooperative transmission scheme called  convolutional network - coded cooperation \" ( cncc ) in a network including @xmath0 sources , one relay with @xmath1 antenna , and one common destination .",
    "the cncc scheme uses the generator matrix of a systematic convolutional code designed on @xmath5 throughout the network as the network coding matrix . in this scheme ,",
    "the systematic packets of the sources are directly transmitted from the sources to the destination , which are simultaneously received and decoded by the relay .",
    "if the relay correctly decodes all the packets , it will generate the parity packets by using the underlying convolutional code , and finally will transmit the parity packets by its best antenna ( the strongest r - d channel ) to the destination .",
    "in contrast to the linear network coding scheme , in our proposed cncc scheme , the diversity order can be enhanced without the reduction of the network throughput , by the increase of the underlying convolutional code s constraint length .",
    "it will be shown that the proposed scheme improves the network throughput , and its diversity order at the worst scenarios ( weak s - r channels ) is equal to @xmath6 , and at the best scenarios ( strong enough s - r channels ) can be much greater than @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , when the relay is located close to the sources , the diversity order can reach to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , and @xmath4 is the free distance of the exploited convolutional code .",
    "it should be noted that the free distance of the convolutional code is increased by the constraint length at the expense of the decoder s complexity .",
    "in contrast to the linear network coding scheme , in our proposed scheme , the network throughput does not depend on the number of antennas , but on the number of parity bits of the convolutional codes .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the system model is described . in section iii ,",
    "the proposed cncc scheme is introduced . in section",
    "iv , the performance of the cncc scheme is analyzed in terms of the sources ber and the diversity order .",
    "four examples for the cncc scheme are presented in section v. the numerical results are provided in section vi .",
    "ultimately , section vii concludes the paper , and suggests some future works .",
    "we consider a cooperative network consisting of @xmath0 single - antenna sources , one @xmath1-antenna relay , and one common single - antenna destination , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure-1 ] .",
    "the relay s @xmath1 antennas are omnidirectional which can be used for both the reception and the transmission .",
    "all the s - d , r - d , and s - r channels are assumed to be block fading channels with the depth of @xmath28 bit transmission intervals , which change independently and identically from one block to another block .",
    "each source has @xmath29 information bits for transmission which is divided to the @xmath30 packets of length @xmath28 bits , where @xmath31 .",
    "we assume a perfect interleaving process throughout the network .",
    "that is , the packets in the sources and the relay are interleaved before transmissions , and the received packets at the relay and the destination are deinterleaved before decoding .",
    "the interleavers must have a sufficient depth ( usually greater than @xmath28 ) such that the successive bits of a packet experience almost independent fading coefficients .",
    "furthermore , the binary phase shift keying ( bpsk ) modulation is used for the transmissions .",
    "the s - d and r - d channels are assumed to be rayleigh fading channels . due to the fact that the relay is close to the sources ,",
    "the s - r channels are assumed to be nakagami-@xmath2 fading channels which for @xmath32 are reduced to the rayleigh , and for @xmath33 act stronger than rayleigh channels , such that for @xmath34 nakagami-@xmath2 channel converts to the awgn channel .",
    "all the transmissions are accomplished through orthogonal time slots like the time division multiple access ( tdma ) protocol .",
    "the duration of each time slot for transmission of a packet ( with the length of @xmath28 bits ) is @xmath35 second . by using a proper cyclic redundancy check ( crc ) code , we assume that the relay is able to detect the erroneous decoded packets .",
    "the relay receives the packet of each source , during the source s dedicated time slots , via its @xmath1 antenna , and then decodes the packet using the maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) of the @xmath1 received signals .",

    ", it will produce the corresponding @xmath48 parity packets by using the convolutional code @xmath50 in ( 1 ) , and after interleaving , will transmit them from its best antennas to the destination during the dedicated time slots .",
    "however , if the relay fails to correctly decode all the @xmath0 packets ( failure @xmath55 situation ) , it will not generate any parity packets , and will inform the destination . in the failure situations , the sources packets are merely decoded based on the signals received through the direct s - d paths without the help of the relay .",
    "but , in the success situations , the destination uses both the sources systematic packets and the parity packets received from the relay , and after deinterleaving , runs the viterbi algorithm to decode all the packets of the sources .    due to the proximity of the relay to the sources ,",

    "we are interested in the lower value for @xmath48 to increase the network throughput .",

    "[ figure-6 ] , when @xmath261 ( second and fourth networks ) , the bers are less vulnerable to the weak s - r channel conditions ( @xmath32 ) than when @xmath262 ( first and third networks ) .",
    "both the second and the fourth networks present the same bers for @xmath32 , @xmath256 , and @xmath259 at the ber range of up to @xmath263 , while for the first and the third networks , the performance in the rayleigh s - r channels ( @xmath32 ) are much worse than those of @xmath256 and @xmath259 .",
    "the effect of the relay s position , between the sources and the destination , on the proposed scheme s performance has been scrutinized in figs .",

    "more specifically , the plots of the bers have been depicted versus @xmath264 for @xmath32 , @xmath256 , and @xmath259 at the given snrs of @xmath265 db for the first network , and @xmath266 db for the third one .",
    "it can be deduced from figs .",
    "[ figure-7 ] and [ figure-8 ] that as the relay locates closer to the sources ( that is , @xmath264 increases ) , the bers of the sources decrease .",
    "again , we see from these figures that the ber results for @xmath256 and @xmath259 are nearly the same , and the ber for @xmath32 is worse than them , especially for the first network with one antenna . based on figs .",
    "[ figure-7 ] and [ figure-8 ] , by the increase of @xmath264 , the sources bers for different @xmath2 converge to the same values which are related to the ideal s - r channels .",
    "the convergence rate depends on the number of the relay s antennas ( @xmath1 ) and the s - r channel conditions ( @xmath2 ) , where the least is related to the first network ( @xmath109 ) with rayleigh s - r channels ( @xmath32 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure-7 ] .    finally , fig .",
    "[ figure-9 ] investigates the impact of the transmitted packet lengths ( @xmath28 ) on the sources upper bound . in this figure ,",
    "the upper bounds have been depicted for @xmath267 in both the second and the fourth networks considering @xmath32 and @xmath255 .",
    "according to fig .",
    "[ figure-9 ] , the increase of the packet length can slightly deteriorate the ber without reducing the achieved diversity order .",
    "however , at the low snrs ( bers up to @xmath268 ) , the ber degradation is negligible .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a new cooperative transmission scheme called  cncc \" in the multi - source networks including one multi - antenna relay .",
    "the upper bound of the ber of the cncc scheme was evaluated and then accordingly the achieved diversity order was computed . in a network with @xmath0 sources and one @xmath1-antenna relay ,",
    "the cncc scheme exploits a good systematic @xmath3 convolutional code over @xmath5 as the network coding matrix which is run at the network level .",
    "it was realized that the proposed cncc scheme can simultaneously enhance the network throughput as well as the diversity order compared to the traditional af and df , and the lnc - based cooperative schemes .",
    "this is because the cncc s network throughput is approximately equal to @xmath58 spcu , which for @xmath269 is greater than ( or equal to ) the network throughputs of lnc ( @xmath24 spcu ) and traditional ( @xmath270 spcu ) schemes with @xmath1 single - antenna relays .",
    "furthermore , it was demonstrated that although the diversity order of the cncc at the worst scenario ( rayleigh s - r channels ) reduces to @xmath6 which is equal to the diversity order of the lnc and the traditional schemes , but the cncc can have better performance due to using the convolutional codes .",
    "however , at the most practical scenarios ( strong s - r channels ) , the diversity order of the cncc scheme reaches to @xmath26 which can be much more than @xmath6 ( @xmath27 where @xmath4 is the free distance of the used convolutional code ) by the increase of the underlying convolutional code s constraint length . in addition , the provided simulation results for the four considered examples verified the accuracy of the theoretical analysis .",
    "it has been realized that the failure situation in which the relay fails to correctly decode all the sources packets restricts the diversity order . as a suggestion to overcome this problem , in the failure situation , instead of not cooperating , the relay can simply amplify the maximum ratio combined signal corresponding to each packet , and transmit it to the destination , which can lead to the improvement of the diversity order in the weak s - r channel conditions .",
