    "<S> rupture is thermally activated and the lifetime follows an arrhenius law where the energy barrier is reduced by disorder . due to the non - homogenous distribution of forces from stress concentration at microcracks tips , spatial correlations between rupture events appear , but they do not affect the energy barrier s dependence on disorder , they affect only the coupling between disorder and the applied load .    the effect of quenched disorder on dynamics is a recurring problem in many physical systems with elastic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the motion of vortex lines in supraconductors , charge - density waves in bragg glasses , magnetic domains walls , or contact lines in wetting show a competition between elastic interactions and pinning by disorder @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while many studies have focused on systems driven above a critical depininng threshold , an important issue remains to understand the sub - critical regime , when thermally activated creep motion occurs @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> rupture in disordered brittle solids falls in the same class of problems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> elastic interactions tend to make a crack propagate in a straight direction while disorder creates roughness @xcite or causes spatially diffuse damage @xcite . in the sub - critical rupture regime , a very important quantity for safety reasons is the lifetime , i.e. the mean time for a sample to break under a prescribed load . </S>",
    "<S> the lifetime follows an arrehnius law @xcite , but thermal noise is generally too small compared to recent theoretical estimates of the energy barrier @xcite to explain experimental observations in heterogenous materials @xcite . for athermal systems , </S>",
    "<S> disorder actually reduces the energy barrier and can be seen as an effective temperature @xcite . in order to clarify the role of disorder in thermal systems , one </S>",
    "<S> - dimensional thermal and disordered fiber bundles models ( @xmath1-tdfbm ) have been introduced to model the thermally activated rupture of an heterogenous material submitted to a constant external load @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the tdfbm considers an elastic system in equilibrium at _ constant temperature _ where statistical force fluctuations occur in time due to thermal noise . </S>",
    "<S> this is very different from previous thermal random fuse models @xcite where rupture results from an increase in fuse temperature due to dissipation through a generalized joule effect until reaching a critical melting temperature . in a tdfbm , </S>",
    "<S> elastic energy is the equivalent of dissipation in the thermal random fuse model but does not cause rupture when the system is at mechanical equilibrium ; rupture is caused by elastic force fluctuations analogous to nyquist noise . </S>",
    "<S> one problem with the @xmath1-tdfbm investigated up to now is that the load is shared equally among all the unbroken fibers . </S>",
    "<S> this is not a realistic load - sharing rule for experimental geometries where elasticity cause stress concentration at microcracks tips and lead to a non - uniform redistribution of stress . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we show that spatial correlations between rupture events in @xmath0 do not affect the dependence of the energy barrier on disorder but only the coupling between disorder and the applied load .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we discuss briefly results obtained by several authors @xcite on the @xmath1-tdfbm . </S>",
    "<S> the system considered is made of a set of @xmath2 parallel fibers , each carrying an initial force @xmath3 and behaving as a linear elastic spring with unity stiffness . </S>",
    "<S> each fiber @xmath4 can carry a maximum force @xmath5 before it breaks . </S>",
    "<S> quenched disorder is introduced in the system by distributing thresholds @xmath5 according to a gaussian distribution of mean @xmath6 and variance @xmath7 ; for each fiber , the value @xmath5 is a time - independent constant . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to the case of non - thermal @xmath1-dfbm where the system evolves due to a progressive increase in total current , we consider that the total force applied to the @xmath1-tdfbm is kept constant . </S>",
    "<S> dynamics is introduced in the system by introducing fluctuations in spring forces due to thermal noise . </S>",
    "<S> we write @xmath8 the average force on fiber @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations in force @xmath9 that occur in time on fiber @xmath4 are assumed to follow a gaussian probability distribution with @xmath10 mean value and variance @xmath11 , where @xmath11 represents the thermodynamical temperature in unit of square force . when the total force on a fiber @xmath12 is larger than the threshold @xmath5 , the fiber breaks . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining fibers share equally the total force : this is a so - called democratic model . </S>",
    "<S> the bundle will break completely as soon as the average force on each fiber exceeds the breaking threshold . </S>",
    "<S> roux has shown that the mean time to break the first fiber follows an arrhenius law where disorder acts as an additive temperature @xcite : @xmath13 with @xmath3 the initial force carried by each fiber of the bundle . in the general case where many fibers break before total rupture of the bundle </S>",
    "<S> , the lifetime obeys an arrhenius law with a different general form : @xmath14 an approximate expression of @xmath15 for low disorder is @xcite : @xmath16 with @xmath17 . for higher disorder , politi et al @xcite </S>",
    "<S> have shown numerically that @xmath15 is determined with a very good approximation by the minimum value of the rate at which fibers break . more precisely , </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath18 is the number of broken fibers and @xmath2 the total number of fibers then @xmath19 is the fraction of broken fibers and @xmath20 its time derivative . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath21 for which @xmath20 is minimum obeys an implicit equation @xcite : @xmath22(1-\\phi^*)^2=\\alpha\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the inverse function of the complementary error function and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath15 can be approximated as @xcite : @xmath25 note that the coupling coefficient @xmath26 depends on both disorder @xmath7 and applied load @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([equexact ] ) predicts that the variation of @xmath15 with @xmath7 for a fixed @xmath3 is non monotonous @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , when @xmath27 ( this condition corresponds to @xmath28 which would be expected in practice for most materials ) , @xmath15 decreases when @xmath7 is increased with @xmath3 constant . in that case </S>",
    "<S> , the function @xmath26 has a lower value @xmath29 and an asymptotic behavior for large @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 @xcite .    to study the effect of a non - uniform force redistribution on the rupture dynamics of the tdfbm </S>",
    "<S> , one could keep a @xmath1 geometry and introduce a finite range of interaction between fibers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we work directly in a @xmath0 geometry more closely related to a real experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the above described 1d - tdfbm is equivalent to a system of parallel fuses where forces are transformed in currents and displacements in electric potentials . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath0 square fuse network is then equivalent to a square lattice of springs in antiplane deformation . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , each node of the @xmath33 nodes square lattice can move along an axis perpendicular to the plane of springs at rest . </S>",
    "<S> a constant force @xmath34 is applied at two opposite sides of the lattice in antiplane configuration . in the initial equilibrium configuration of the lattice , </S>",
    "<S> the springs submitted to a load @xmath35 are called `` parallel '' springs while the unloaded springs ( zero force ) are called `` orthogonal '' springs .    like in @xmath1 , the fluctuations in force @xmath9 on spring @xmath4 follow a gaussian probability distribution with @xmath10 mean value and variance @xmath11 , and the rupture thresholds @xmath36 follow a gaussian distribution of mean @xmath6 and variance @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the time scale in the simulation is the ( constant ) time between two configurations of force fluctuations in the system . </S>",
    "<S> the whole network is a square with sides 100 springs wide ; thus , the lattice contains about @xmath37 springs . </S>",
    "<S> whenever we choose rupture thresholds from the gaussian distribution , there is a non - zero probability to obtain a negative threshold : @xmath38 . for a system with @xmath39 springs </S>",
    "<S> , we can safely consider that no spring will spontaneously break when there is no load ( @xmath40 ) and at zero temperature if @xmath41 , thus @xmath42 when @xmath43 . in practice </S>",
    "<S> , we will work with @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> first , let us consider a lattice with no disorder in the rupture thresholds and all the springs initially intact . when thermal noise is on , some springs will start to break . </S>",
    "<S> due to stress concentration effects , as soon as one of the parallel springs is broken , the neighboring springs are submitted to a larger force . </S>",
    "<S> if that new force exceeds the rupture threshold then the neighboring spring will also break , and the force on the next neighbor will be even higher </S>",
    "<S> . this process will result in the rupture of the whole network in an avalanche started from a single rupture event . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , this will occur in our lattice as soon as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the critical threshold of the homogenous lattice at @xmath47 when one parallel spring is broken . in that case , the rupture time will be directly related to the probability of breaking a single spring in the network and , if the lattice is disordered , we will recover essentially the result given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ1 ] ) @xcite . in the rest of the paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will be interested only in the case where several springs break before the final avalanche occurs , i.e. when @xmath48 .    . </S>",
    "<S> various symbols correspond to different values of disorder and applied force . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line corresponds to @xmath49.,width=302 ]    for a fixed value of the applied force @xmath3 and a fixed value of the disorder @xmath7 , we measure as a function of temperature @xmath11 the lifetime , i.e. the rupture time averaged over as many as @xmath50 numerical experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we find that lifetime follows an arrhenius law and obtain numerically @xmath51 as defined by eq  ( [ eqtau ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see on figure  [ tau ] the collapse of the data for a range of values @xmath52 and @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> some of the data points are more scattered around the expected behavior ( solid line ) than others because the ratio of the standard deviation over the mean of the rupture time increases when @xmath11 becomes small . </S>",
    "<S> this property , already mentioned in @xcite , makes numerical convergence of the mean difficult in some cases .     in @xmath0 and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equexact ] ) in @xmath1 ( solid line ) . </S>",
    "<S> inset : same scaling , but using the numerical value @xmath54 for the @xmath0 lattice.,width=302 ]     which is only a function of @xmath3 but not of @xmath7 , contrary to the case of @xmath26 which is a function of @xmath7.,width=287 ]     as a function of @xmath3 ( circles ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed and dotted lines correspond to @xmath26 as predicted by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equexact ] ) when @xmath55 and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> close to @xmath57 , the values found for @xmath58 are close to values predicted by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ1]).,width=302 ]    to compare the barrier @xmath51 for the @xmath0 geometry with the one of the @xmath1-tdfbm , we plot on figure  [ uexact ] @xmath59 as a function of @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly see that the functional form for @xmath26 is not correct , but also that the data for various values of disorder do not rescale very well . </S>",
    "<S> the first immediate reason for the discrepancy is that for @xmath61 , the energy barrier of the @xmath0 network @xmath54 ( determined numerically ) is not @xmath62 as in @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the preferential redistribution on the nearest neighbors of the force carried by a fiber before rupture . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the effective energy barrier in @xmath0 does not improve the comparison with the 1d - tdfbm . after replacing @xmath63 by @xmath64 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equexact ] ) , we see in the inset of figure  [ uexact ] that it is not enough to get a good collapse of all the data on the theoretical prediction ( solid line ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the barrier decreases with disorder following the linear curve : @xmath65 for @xmath53 and a fixed value of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it turns out that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equapprox ] ) is a much better functional form than eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equexact ] ) , even though it is an approximate expression in @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> looking at eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equapprox ] ) or eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equexact ] ) , we can make an analogy with the @xmath1 case and say that the second coefficient @xmath66 corresponds to an effective value @xmath67 which is now only a function of @xmath3 . on figure  [ uapp ] </S>",
    "<S> , we see the collapse of all the data when we plot @xmath68 as a function of @xmath69 .    </S>",
    "<S> the coupling coefficient @xmath58 increases almost linearly with @xmath3 up to values close to @xmath57 ( figure  [ beta ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , when @xmath3 gets very close to @xmath57 , there is an abrupt decrease in the value of @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> this is related to the fact that rupture is now controlled by a single event as in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ1 ] ) . indeed , although eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ1 ] ) does not follow the general scaling property of eq.([eqtau ] ) , we can estimate a value @xmath58 for each temperature value used in the simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the average value found for @xmath58 from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ1 ] ) ( square symbols in figure  [ beta ] with an error bar corresponding to variations with temperature ) is a reasonable estimate of the numerical value .    </S>",
    "<S> the functional behavior of @xmath58 is very different from that of the @xmath1 model ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equexact ] ) ) where @xmath26 depends on both @xmath3 and @xmath7 . as an example , we plot on figure  [ beta ] @xmath70 for fixed values of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> not only the functional dependence is clearly different from the numerical estimate @xmath71 but also @xmath26 decreases with @xmath7 at fixed @xmath3 . in that sense , </S>",
    "<S> the load and the disorder do not act cooperatively in @xmath1 .     and @xmath72 ( top left ) , @xmath73 ( top right ) , @xmath74 ( bottom left ) ; @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( bottom right ) . </S>",
    "<S> the arrow shows the loading direction.,width=302 ]    the key point in @xmath0 is that the spatial correlations between rupture events depend on the strength of stress intensification . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated on figure  [ image ] a ) to c ) which shows the broken fibers just before the final avalanche for different values of @xmath3 and a fixed value of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> for very small loads , damage is scattered everywhere in the sample . at higher loads , </S>",
    "<S> damage becomes less scattered and growth of straight cracks occurs . finally , figure  [ image]d ) shows that for a load close to the critical threshold , only very few events occur . </S>",
    "<S> a similar transition was observed for zero disorder or annealed disorder models with power law rate of rupture @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to these models where the transition occurs by changing the exponent of the power law , we observe a transition resulting from the competition between stress intensification and quenched disorder .    to understand this transition in our model , let us consider the increase in force due to stress intensification when a spring breaks </S>",
    "<S> . if the increase is small compared to @xmath77 , there will be very little spatial correlation between rupture events occurring preferentially at the weakest springs . </S>",
    "<S> for a given disorder , there is always a force @xmath3 small enough to observe this rupture regime similar to the @xmath1-tdfbm case . on the contrary , if the increase due to stress intensification is large compared to @xmath77 , it is easier to break a spring next to an already broken spring , and the rupture will proceed mainly by growth of multiple cracks . in spite of very different regimes of spatial correlation between rupture events , we have the remarkable result that the energy barrier dependence on @xmath7 is unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> spatial correlations only affects the coupling coefficient @xmath58 , increasing quasi - linearly with @xmath3 and independent of @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> the multiplicative amplification of disorder due to @xmath58 is a mechanism that will create a load - dependent reduction of the energy barrier in thermally activated rupture . </S>",
    "<S> it will have an effect on the order of magnitude and load - dependence of the rupture time which could help understanding experiments in heterogeneous materials @xcite .    in conclusion , we have studied thermally activated rupture of a @xmath0 elastic spring network submitted to a constant load and thermal noise . </S>",
    "<S> we find that spatial correlations between rupture events are controlled by a competition between quenched disorder and force inhomogeneities due to stress concentration . for low spatial correlations , </S>",
    "<S> the energy barrier scales naturally like in the @xmath1 model . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the appearance of spatial correlations does not affect the functional dependence of the energy barrier on disorder , but only the coupling coefficient @xmath58 which is independent of disorder and increases quasi - linearly with the applied load @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is an important result showing that the applied load contribute to amplify in a cooperative way the effect of disorder on the lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> the observed cooperative effects of load and disorder in @xmath0 subcritical rupture could be relevant to the creep regime of other physical systems with elastic interactions @xcite and also to crackling noise @xcite . </S>"
