    "dickel & daw  @xcite recently proposed an efficient , approximate means of calculating vibrational mode lifetimes in solids .",
    "the method involves ensemble averages of appropriate functions in phase space that can be carried out by conventional monte carlo in combination with a means of calculating forces , such as interatomic potentials or first - principles electronic structure codes .",
    "the approach was illustrated on a lattice model of non - linear interactions , where the dependence of the mode lifetimes on cell size and temperature was investigated numerically .    while the aim of the original work was to further calculations of vibrational mode lifetimes in solids ,",
    "the purpose of the present work is to examine in more detail the approximations involved in the method . to this end",
    "we take up the same method as applied to very simple systems of just one or two degrees of freedom . in considering systems of such simplicity",
    ", we analyzed some aspects of the problem analytically as well as numerically , and the insights obtained are reported here .",
    "these insights are expected to prove fruitful in the application of this method to the original target ( vibrational lifetimes in solids ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we recap briefly the proposal of dickel & daw ( dd ) .",
    "then we apply the proposed method to the simple dynamical models considered here .",
    "our analysis of the results focuses on the density of states , by which we can understand when and why the approximations work as they do .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions .",
    "we summarize here the proposed method of dd , who began by examining the momentum auto - correlation function ( macf ) @xmath0 where the angular brackets indicate phase - space averages over the canonical ensemble at temperature @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the auto - correlation can be studied in terms of the liouvillian  @xcite , which governs the time evolution of functions @xmath3 in phase space according to @xmath4 where the ( hermitian ) liouvillian operator is @xmath5 the equation of motion can be integrated formally , so that @xmath6 and we can express the auto - correlation explicitly in terms of @xmath7 : @xmath8    the taylor series of @xmath9 @xmath10 relates the derivatives of @xmath9 at @xmath11 to the moments of the liouvillian acting on the momentum : @xmath12 these moments are also the moments of the density of states ( dos ) derived from @xmath9 . that is , taking the fourier transform of @xmath9 to get @xmath13 , the moments are also @xmath14    auto - correlation functions considered in this work typically have strong oscillations dampened by some sort of decaying envelope ( for examples , see figs .  [ figmacfx4]-[figmacf_cubic ] ) .",
    "we propose here to use the area under the square of the macf as a measure of the lifetime @xmath15 this is not intended to correspond to a particular physical measurement that might be performed , but rather is suggested as a simple generic measure of the rate of the decay of the correlation .",
    "such a measure also lends itself easily to analysis , as we shall see . using parseval s theorem",
    ", the lifetime is also given as the area under the @xmath16 curve : @xmath17 dd observed that the lifetime @xmath18 can be expressed as a function of the moments @xmath19 which can be re - expressed ( using dimensional analysis ) as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and the @xmath22 s are dimensionless parameters @xmath23 that characterize the shape of the dos . while it is not generally possible to know all of the moments , dd proposed that in certain circumstances the lifetime might be practically approximated from a knowledge of only the lowest moments .",
    "this suggests a series of approximations , starting with only the second moment @xmath24 and including successively higher moments .",
    "the fourth moment approximation would then be @xmath25 where @xmath26 is some function yet to be determined .",
    "the higher moments correspond to ensemble averages of higher powers of the liouvillian , and so each higher moment involves higher time derivatives of the dynamical variables .",
    "dd then went on ( in part 2 ) to test the lowest approximation on a simple model of non - linear lattice vibrations as a function of cell size and temperature .",
    "first , much as done by ladd , _ et al . _ ,  @xcite dd calculated from ordinary molecular dynamics the auto - correlation function for each normal mode a periodic cell of a given size ( appropriately sampled at the specified temperature ) and from there the lifetime .",
    "second , they calculated using standard monte carlo the second moment @xmath27 ( hence @xmath28 ) for each mode .",
    "( this second part of the demonstration is , of course , requires much less computational time than the first . )",
    "they then plotted @xmath29 vs. temperature for all modes , and found that at high temperatures the lifetime was simply proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , at high temperature , the auto - correlation functions scaled in a simple way . that is , plotting all of the calculated @xmath30 vs. @xmath31 exhibited a data collapse , revealing that indeed the high - temperature dynamics of the mode decay could simply be described by a single parameter .",
    "thus , the high temperature behavior was well approximated at the lowest level ( second moment ) .",
    "dd ended by speculating that the behavior over the full range of temperature might be accounted for by including fourth moment , but that was not tested . also , that paper did not offer much insight as to why the second moment approximation should work well at high temperature but be insufficient at low temperatures .",
    "the present study uses several simple dynamical models as the basis for testing the fourth moment approximation and also in using the density of states to provide an analysis of why the approximation might work and when it would be expected to fail .",
    "we consider three simple model hamiltonians in one ( @xmath32 ) and two ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) dimensions .",
    "these models are chosen because they are simple , non - linear , and the ensemble averages can be obtained analytically .",
    "the momentum conjugate to @xmath32 is @xmath34 ; that to @xmath33 is @xmath35 .",
    "+ @xmath36    the auto - correlation in the @xmath37 model has been studied extensively before  @xcite . in that work , an analytic approximation to @xmath9",
    "was obtained at low temperature : @xmath38 showing an oscillatory behavior with an _ algebraically _ decaying envelope .",
    "our calculated auto - correlation conforms well to this analytical form at low temperatures .",
    "+ @xmath39    the @xmath40 model is a simple extension to two modes coupled nonlinearly . in this model , we investigate various values of the ratio ( @xmath41 ) of the masses between the two modes , which controls the degree of resonance .",
    "+ @xmath42    the `` cubic '' model for certain parameters has multiple minima in the @xmath43 plane and exhibits a `` structural '' transformation ( from multiple attractors to a single attractor ) with temperature , which makes it interesting to include in the present study . to explore the effects produced by this transition , we tried various values of the strength ( @xmath44 ) of the cubic term . for @xmath45 , there are 3 off - center global minima with one local minimum on - center . for @xmath46",
    "only there is only 1 global minimum on - center",

    "similar results can be seen for the @xmath40 model ( see fig .  [ macfx2y2 ] ) .     vs @xmath49 of the @xmath32-mode for the @xmath53 model .",
    "the straight line is a fit using eq .",
    "[ eqfit ] . ]    the relations in figs .",
    "[ macfx4]-[macfx2y2 ] are fit well by @xmath54 from the analytic approximation to macf for the @xmath37 model at low temperature ( eq .  [ sen_eq ] ) , we can also calculate @xmath18 , @xmath27 , and @xmath55 , and we find @xmath56 the analytical form for @xmath9 was derived by sen , _",
    "et al . _ only for low temperatures , by noting the dependence of the oscillator frequency on energy and the contributions of different energies in the canonical ensemble .",
    "however , here we find the relationship between @xmath18 , @xmath28 , and @xmath49 extends over a large range of temperature .",
    "the reason for this extended range will be understood better below .    at low @xmath1 ,",
    "the low moments for both @xmath37 and @xmath40 models behave similarly , in that @xmath57 and @xmath58 so that @xmath49 approaches 1 as @xmath59",
    ". thus @xmath28 is approaches a constant while @xmath60 goes to zero , and the lifetime diverges like @xmath61 at low temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence at low @xmath1 is dominated by the approach of @xmath49 to 1 .    at high temperature ,",
    "the moments for the @xmath37 model go as @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "so @xmath49 saturates to a constant as @xmath64 , leaving only the variation in @xmath28 to account for the change in lifetime .",
    "thus the lifetime at high @xmath1 , is governed by the behavior of @xmath28 and @xmath65 .",
    "this accounts well for the two power - law regimes visible in fig .",
    "[ lifetime_x4 ] .    for the @xmath40 model , by contrast , at high temperature , the moments go as @xmath66 and @xmath67 which makes @xmath49 go as @xmath68 .",
    "this cancels a @xmath68 dependence in @xmath28 leaving @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath40 models seem to be well - described by the simple combination of the first two moments .",
    "however , by contrast , the corresponding scatterplot for the `` cubic model '' deviates significantly ( fig .",
    "[ macfcubic ] ) , so that there is no simple relationship between @xmath18 and the first two moments .",
    "evidently , higher moments will be required to capture the dynamical behavior of the cubic model over a wide range of temperatures and parameters .",
    "vs @xmath49 of the @xmath32-mode for the  cubic \" model , showing irregular behavior as compared to the other models ( figs .",
    "[ macfx4]-[macfx2y2 ] ) . ]",
    "from the previous results , we see that the behavior of the lifetime for the @xmath37 and @xmath40 models over a wide range of parameters and temperature is captured in the behavior of the two lowest moments ( @xmath27 and @xmath55 ) which can be calculated analytically . however , for the cubic model , the behavior is more complex , requiring at least higher moments in the description .",
    "we investigate here the reasons for success in one case and not in the other .",
    "[ data_collapse ] shows the insight gained from checking for a data - collapse for @xmath9 , by scaling the time @xmath70 by the lifetime @xmath18 ( fig .",

    "the results illustrate that while the oscillations of auto - correlation functions vary with temperature , they are contained by one decaying envelope , which is what we are trying to capture .     model ( as explained in the text . ) ]    as one might expect from the data - collapse , the dos for the @xmath37 model is also simple , as shown in fig  [ dos_x4 ] for various temperatures .     model . ]",
    "the dos of this model is characterized by a single dominant peak that shifts and broadens with temperature , as one would typically expect of a vibrational mode in an anharmonic solid . in such a case",
    ", the lifetime depends mostly on the shape of the dos around the peak , and two parameters ( peak value of the dos and the width ) are sufficient to describe it . at low temperatures , @xmath71 , while at high temperatures @xmath72 ( for this model ) . recalling @xmath49 as the ( dimensionless ) ratio @xmath73 ,",
    "it is aptly designated as a `` shape parameter '' of the dos .",
    "the dos of the @xmath53 model ( fig .",
    "[ dos_x2y2 ] ) is only somewhat more complex than that of the @xmath37 model .",
    "-mode at @xmath74 for the @xmath53 model ]    the simple evolution of the dos with the temperature and other parameters for these models explains why a simple , generic relationship can exist between @xmath18 and the first two moments of the dos . to explore this point further ,",
    "let us consider a generic , single - mode dos that is peaked at an oscillator frequency @xmath75 and broadened to a width @xmath76 .",
    "both the oscillator frequency and width will depend on temperature . at low temperatures , @xmath77 , and from eq .",
    "[ eq : n2 ] we have @xmath78 the leading behavior of the lowest two moments is @xmath79 @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 depend on the details of the dos .",
    "then @xmath83 and @xmath84 eliminating @xmath76 and @xmath75 among the two relations gives @xmath85 just as we found in eq .",
    "[ eqfit ] .",
    "so long as the dos has this simple , generic behavior , the same relationship obtained here should hold .    at high temperatures , if the dos can be assumed to be a mostly featureless and broad distribution with width @xmath76 and height @xmath86 , then @xmath87 and @xmath88 so @xmath89 . while the shape parameter saturates at some value ( @xmath90 ) , in which case the variation in @xmath18 is tracked by that of @xmath28 , so that @xmath91 which is the behavior reported by dd .",
    "the dos of cubic model ( fig .  [ dos_cubic ] ) is much more complicated than that of @xmath37 and @xmath53 model , which explains why the simple 2-parameter scatterplot ( fig .  [ macfcubic ] ) does not capture the behavior .",
    "-mode at @xmath92 and various temperatures for the cubic model . ]",
    "finally we note that @xmath49 , in addition to being a simple measure of the shape of the dos , is also a direct measure of the degree of anharmonicity of the mode as averaged over the ensemble .",
    "specifically , @xmath49 for a given mode can be re - written as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the force associated with a displacement @xmath32 .",
    "a harmonic system is , of course , defined where the force obeys @xmath95 . in the anharmonic ensemble , we could define an effective @xmath96 by that which minimizes the deviation from linear .",
    "that is , define the effective @xmath96 by minimizing @xmath97 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath98 then measures the degree of anharmonicity of the system as effective for the ensemble . for a harmonic system , @xmath99 .",
