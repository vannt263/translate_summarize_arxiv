    "non - statistical event - by - event fluctuations have been proposed as a possible signature for the qcd phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the passage of the system close to the critical point of the qcd phase diagram might be indicated by a non - monotonic evolution of fluctuations as function of beam energy .",
    "these exciting predictions triggered an extensive study of event - by - event fluctuations at sps and at rhic .",
    "the existence of non - statistical event - by - event fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum @xmath0 at sps and rhic is by now well established .",
    "however , these dynamical fluctuations are small in central collisions , typically about 1% of the inclusive mean transverse momentum @xmath1 , and only weakly depending on @xmath2 , see fig.[fig1 ] ( left panel )  @xcite .",
    "this value is roughly compatible with the extrapolation of fluctuation measurements in p - p collisions  @xcite under the assumption of an independent superposition of particle sources in a - a .",
    "in particular , no indication for a non - monotonic beam energy dependence has been found so far .    despite the absence of a smoking gun signature for the phase transition or the critical point ,",
    "the systematic study of @xmath0 fluctuations gives valuable insight into the particle production mechanism and the dynamic evolution of the system which can not be extracted from inclusive distributions .",
    "a quantitative study requires an appropriate formalism which facilitates a comparison of results among different experiments and to theory .",
    "presently , an unfortunate situation has arisen : practically each experiment uses different measures for fluctuations , see  @xcite .",
    "these measures have very different sensitivities to particular experimental conditions , such as track quality cuts , tracking efficiency , and acceptance . in this sense ,",
    "measures which are most closely related to single and two - particle densities appear preferable since they are the least sensitive to trivial efficiency effects  @xcite . in this situation , it is mandatory that experiments provide all the information necessary for an approximative conversion of one measure into another .",
    "it was also pointed out that there can be non - trivial acceptance effects  @xcite .",
    "depending on the scale of the underlying correlation , the measured fluctuation pattern may change as function of the acceptance window .",
    "for instance , back - to - back configurations may enhance flow or jet - like correlations .",
    "an attempt for a differential , scale - dependent analysis of @xmath0 fluctuations has been presented at this conference  @xcite .    attention has been raised recently by the centrality dependence of @xmath0 fluctuations observed at sps and rhic .",
    "experiments na49 , ceres , phenix , and star observe @xmath0 fluctuations which are significantly increased over the p - p extrapolation in semi - central events  @xcite ( e.g. middle and right panel in fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "phenix attributed the non - monotonic centrality dependence of the measure @xmath3  @xcite to jet production in peripheral events , combined with jet suppression in more central events , causing a decrease of fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "it was , however , argued that the redistribution of the quenched jet energy to lower transverse momenta may not be treated consistently in their model .",
    "gavin interpreted the centrality dependence in terms of thermalization  @xcite , but a reasonable description of the data was also found in the framework of a string percolation model  @xcite .",
    "although quite different in the underlying physical picture , the thermalization and the percolation approach have an important feature in common : the well - established increase of mean @xmath4 as function of centrality does not reflect a smooth excitation of transverse phase space , but rather results from a superposition of distinct @xmath4 scales . a lower one , characteristic for elementary p - p collisions , and a larger one established in thermalized clumps or string clusters . as a consequence ,",
    "largest fluctuations occur in semi - central events where spatial inhomogeneities are maximal and both scales contribute with about equal strength .",
    "results on net charge fluctuations at sps and rhic have been presented at this conference  @xcite .",
    "all experiments report that net charge fluctuations are smaller than the statistical expectation for independent particle emission . to a large extent",
    ", these deviations can be attributed to global charge conservation .",
    "additional contributions are small at lower sps energies  @xcite but possibly increase with beam energy  @xcite .",
    "these could be subject to local charge correlations , e.g.  due to resonance decays .",
    "indeed , resonance gas models are able to reproduce the measured net charge fluctuations reasonably well  @xcite .",
    "particle production via resonances ( or more general : clusters ) exhibits a characteristic correlation scale of about one unit in rapidity  @xcite .",
    "star has measured the net charge fluctuation @xmath5 as function of the integrated pseudorapidity range  @xcite .",
    "they reported that @xmath6 decreases monotonically as the rapidity window is opened , in line with the above mentioned correlation scale due to particle production in clusters .",
    "this pattern may , however , be modified by dynamics and the details of the space - time evolution .",
    "indeed , star observes that the ( relative ) @xmath7 dependence of @xmath5 in peripheral au - au collisions at @xmath8 , 130 , and 200  agev is very similar to p - p , while in central au - au collisions the fluctuation signal is significantly more focussed at small pseudorapidity windows . as pointed out in  @xcite , this effect is essentially equivalent with the narrowing of the balance function  @xcite , observed by star and na49  @xcite , and may be related to an increase of @xmath1 in central collisions .",
    "another important implication of these results is that hadronization occurs `` late '' , i.e. that diffusive processes after hadron production may not be very effective , in line with the notion of a short - lived hadronic phase .",
    "phobos has measured charge - independent forward - backward multiplicity fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations in their observable @xmath9 are enhanced with respect to the statistical expectation , depending on the size and the separation of the forward and backward pseudorapidity intervals .",
    "these results point to correlated particle production which extends over about one unit of rapidity , qualitatively consistent with the net charge fluctuation results described before .",
    "experiment na49 has , for the first time , presented results on event - by - event fluctuations of the negatively charged particle multiplicity at 158 agev / c  @xcite . as a function of the number of projectile participants , a non - monotonic behaviour with a distinct maximum in intermediate mass systems",
    "is observed , see fig .",
    "[ figna49 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "note the similarity to the centrality dependence of @xmath0 fluctuations ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . by the definition of @xmath0 ,",
    "a connection between multiplicity and @xmath0 fluctuations is not unexpected .",
    "future studies could show to what extent these two quantities fluctuate in a correlated way .",
    "event - by - event fluctuations of the particle yield ratios @xmath10 and @xmath11 have been studied by na49 as a function of beam energy  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of the @xmath11-ratio are consistent with urqmd calculations and most likely due to correlations from resonance decays .",
    "in contrast , @xmath10 fluctuations show a significant energy dependence and are enhanced with respect to model calculations , as demonstrated in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ figna49 ] .",
    "the enhancement is most pronounced at the lowest beam energy .",
    "these preliminary results might be connected with the previously reported non - monotonic behaviour of the @xmath12 excitation function  @xcite and could give insight with regards to the possible occurence of the phase transition .",
    "further investigations , in particular of charge - dependent fluctuations , but also more extended model studies are needed to unravel trivial and non - trivial contributions to this observable .",
    "previous hbt studies of identical pions in au - au collisions at rhic yielded source parameters only moderately larger than at lower beam energies . in particular , hydrodynamic models ,",
    "successful at rhic in describing single particle momentum space distributions , fail to reproduce the measured hbt radii ( see  @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "the observed evolution and emission time scales are apparently shorter than predicted by the models .",
    "this so - called hbt - puzzle has not yet been entirely resolved .",
    "in fact , more puzzling hbt results have been presented at this conference .",
    "i am happy too see that by now all experiments adopted a new treatment of the final state coulomb repulsion which takes into account the finite purity of the pion sample  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig_hbt ] ( left panel )  @xcite the results of the new treatment ( full symbols ) are compared to those assuming a pure pion sample ( open symbols ) .",
    "as demonstrated earlier  @xcite the hbt radii , in particular the ratio @xmath13 , are very sensitive in this respect .",
    "phenix presented a very detailed centrality dependence of pion hbt radii in au - au at 200 gev  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig_hbt ] , left panel ) .",
    "all three bertsch - pratt parameters show a linear increase with @xmath14 . in some ways",
    ", this is a surprising result : the space - time properties and the freeze - out dynamics are expected to change drastically from very peripheral to central events .",
    "the hbt radii , however , show no indication of a qualitative change .",
    "they scale essentially with the initial volume of the participating nucleons .",
    "a detailed energy scan of identical - pion hbt at sps was presented by na49  @xcite .",
    "these preliminary results show only a very weak beam energy dependence .",
    "inconsistencies with existing hbt data from sps  @xcite , most pronounced in @xmath15 , require further investigations .",
    "the observed beam energy dependence of hbt radii had been shown to be consistent with a universal mean free path at freeze - out @xmath16  fm  @xcite .",
    "magestro showed that this universality holds also in p - p and d - au at rhic  @xcite .",
    "the idea of a constant @xmath17 independent of the system size seems to disagree with the notion of a rescattering - dominated late stage of the collision .",
    "although the system size increases , freeze - out remains a local phenomenon .",
    "it is conceivable that an expected increase of @xmath17 with system size is counterbalanced by an increase of the expansion rate , however , a quantitative cancellation over the full centrality range is astonishing .",
    "the dependence of the hbt radii on the mean pair transverse momentum @xmath18 is expected to be sensitive to the details of the dynamical evolution .",
    "new results on @xmath18-dependences have been shown by na49  @xcite , phenix  @xcite , phobos  @xcite , and star  @xcite .",
    "star presented a compilation of pion hbt radii from p - p , d - au , and au - au at 200 gev .",
    "the @xmath18-dependences of the hbt radii indicate strong space - momentum correlations in all systems . in central au - au collisions ,",
    "such space - momentum correlations had been attributed to hydrodynamic flow . in elementary collisions ,",
    "space - momentum correlations arise from string fragmentation .",
    "also resonance decays may play an important role in p - p .",
    "it is , however , striking that the shape of the @xmath18-dependences does not change significantly with system size , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_hbt ] , although the underlying mechanisms are presumably very different .",
    "this result clearly disfavors an independent superposition of p - p : the pronounced @xmath18-dependences observed in au - au indicate space - momentum correlations over a range which is of the order of the system size . in the case of independent p - p collisions",
    "the range of space - momentum correlations would be confined to the size of individual nucleons , and result in significantly weaker @xmath18-dependences  @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the hbt data reveal characteristic features of self - similarity between p - p and au - au , rather than a simple superposition .",
    "in essence , system size dependent hbt studies at rhic reveal new aspects of the hbt - puzzle : at fixed beam energy , hbt radii scale with the initial reaction volume .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath18-dependences with system size exhibit a self - similar pattern and do not hold with an independent superposition of p - p collisions . however , no qualitative change of the dynamical evolution from p - p to central au - au is observed .",
    "possible conclusions are surprising : either the space - time evolution in central au - au is very similar to that in p - p , or the sensitivity of interferometric measurements to the dynamics of the system is not as expected  @xcite .",
    "the answer to this problem remains one of the big challenges of this field .",
    "results from a new analysis by star in non - central au - au collisions at 200 gev  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig_azi ] , left panel ) confirm earlier conclusions from preliminary results : the pion source retains its initial out - of - plane orientation as imposed by collision geometry , see fig .",
    "[ fig_azi ] ( right panel ) .",
    "the early pressure and the evolution time of the system are not sufficient to turn the source eccentricity into the reaction plane .",
    "these results provide important constraints for dynamical models and may be interpreted as an independent indication for a short evolution time  @xcite .",
    "in particular , these findings seem to disfavor a long - lived hadronic rescattering phase  @xcite .      very impressive results on non -",
    "identical particle correlations in au - au at 130 and 200 gev have been presented by star  @xcite .",
    "such correlations occur due to final state coulomb and strong interaction and are sensitive to possible differences of the freeze - out hypersurfaces of different particle species  @xcite . in the present analysis ,",
    "correlation functions for a number of particle combinations have been presented for the first time ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) .",
    "these data can be used to study unknown interaction potentials .",
    "the typical asymmetric correlation patterns have indeed been observed .",
    "these asymmetries may point to asynchronous emission of different particle species due to sequential freeze - out or resonance decays .",
    "in addition , in systems with collective expansion , such differences arise naturally due to space - momentum and space - time correlations .",
    "comparison to a blast - wave approximation indicates that strong collectivity leads to asymmetries which are consistent with the experimental results .",
    "further studies need to show whether additional contributions are indicated by the data .",
