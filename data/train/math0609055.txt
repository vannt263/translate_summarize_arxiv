    "various kinds of spinning constructions , all of which stem from artin s original construction @xcite , are now basic tools in the study of high - dimensional knots in _ codimension two _ , that is , in the study of embeddings of @xmath7-manifolds in the @xmath8-sphere .    on another front , haefliger found smooth knots in _ codimensions greater than two _ @xcite .",
    "he showed that the group @xmath9 of isotopy classes of smooth embeddings of the @xmath7-sphere @xmath10 into @xmath11-sphere @xmath12 is often non - trivial even when @xmath13 .",
    "although many spinning constructions can be applied for such `` high - codimensional '' knots , there have been very few related studies @xcite .",
    "budney @xcite gave a new description of a generator of the haefliger knot group @xmath14 .",
    "this was related to his study on the space @xmath15 of `` long '' knots in @xmath5-space . here , @xmath16 is the space of _ long knots _  smooth embeddings of @xmath17 which are standard outside the unit disk in @xmath18 .",
    "we note that the restriction of a long embedding to the unit disk gives a properly embedded @xmath19-disk in the unit @xmath7-disk  our construction will refer to it .",

    "the geometric nature of graphing constructions here is a high - codimensional version of litherland s deform - spinning .",

    "[ subsect : seifert ] .    by theorem  [ thm : invariant ] , together with proposition  [ prop : euler ] , we have @xmath258 this completes the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "in view of the proof in  [ subsect : proof ] , we easily see the following .",
    "in the construction of @xmath32 , by using @xmath259 ( @xmath260 ) for spinning ( i.e.  if we change the speed of the resolutions ) , we obtain the spun knot representing @xmath261 times the generator represented by @xmath124 in @xmath14 .    all of our arguments are valid for higher - dimensional haefliger knots @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "first of all , budney s resolution map is actually defined also in higher dimensions @xcite and our construction of the spun knot works there .",
    "furthermore , since we also have higher - dimensional versions of theorem  [ thm : invariant ] ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.3 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  5.1 ) ) , the proof is directly extended in high dimensions .",
    "namely , we have :    if we deform - spin @xmath262 about @xmath36 via the higher - dimensional budney map @xcite @xmath37 ( which corresponds to the case where we put @xmath263 in budney s description of the generator of @xmath264 @xcite ) , then the resultant spun knot represents a generator of @xmath34 for @xmath44 .",
    "all the steps of the proof parallel those of the case @xmath49 (  [ sect : seifert ] ) with little alteration .",
