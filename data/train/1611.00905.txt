    ", geostrophic flow may coexist with fast , three - dimensional fluctuations in the form of inertial waves  @xcite .",
    "inertial waves are anisotropic , circularly polarized dispersive waves that propagate because of the restoring nature of the coriolis force  @xcite .",
    "it was recently demonstrated by gallet  @xcite that two - dimensionality can be reached exactly provided that the rossby number is smaller than a reynolds - number - dependent critical value .",
    "however , for most laboratory experiments , numerical simulations and geophysical flows , the rossby number is moderate , @xmath6 , and the system is generally far from this asymptotic two - dimensional state  @xcite .",
    "this departure from two - dimensionality can not be neglected in general : although most of the kinetic energy is carried by the geostrophic flow , three - dimensional fluctuations still remain responsible of most of the energy dissipation  @xcite .",
    "a question of practical interest is , for given initial or boundary conditions , to what extent a turbulent flow in a rotating frame is two - dimensional , and how the amount of two - dimensionality depends on the reynolds and rossby numbers .",
    "this question has received much attention , both experimentally  @xcite and numerically  @xcite .",
    "recently , we introduced a simple configuration to address this question : it consists of an impeller rotating at a rate @xmath0 in a fluid under global rotation around the same axis at a rate @xmath1 .",
    "this configuration was first characterized at moderate to large rossby number , @xmath7 , in campagne _",
    "et al . _",

    "the aim of the present paper is to explore the route towards two - dimensionality in this flow at much smaller rossby number , down to @xmath9 .    a closely related configuration to investigate the transition towards two - dimensionality at low rossby number , considered first in the pioneering work of hide and titman @xcite , consists in spinning a disk in a rotating cylindrical container . at sufficiently low rossby number ,",
    "apart from boundaries , the flow is divided in two domains in solid - body rotation at angular velocity @xmath10 ( inside the cylinder tangential to the disk ) and @xmath1 ( outside this cylinder ) , separated by a stewartson shear layer  @xcite . as the rossby number is further decreased , this shear layer becomes unstable with respect to azimuthal modulations of increasing mode order @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "this instability , often referred to as barotropic  @xcite , is generically observed in flows forced by a purely axisymmetric small differential rotation in a rapidly rotating system , in cylindrical  @xcite or spherical  @xcite geometries .",
    "the situation is more complex for a non - axisymmetric forcing , as the impeller considered here .",
    "first , the natural mode of the barotropic instability may be modified by the symmetry of the forcing ( typically the number of blades for an impeller ) .",
    "second , the non - axisymmetric `` topography '' of the forcing may be sources of inertial waves , which may delay the transition towards pure geostrophy .",
    "when excited by a disturbance moving at constant velocity , these inertial waves interfere and may form a stationary wake traveling with the disturbance  @xcite . in our experiment",
    "we find that , in the case of a rotating impeller , the wakes of inertial waves attached to each blade interact and produce small - scale fluctuations superimposed to the large - scale geostrophic flow , making the 2d transition in such flow richer than for a purely axisymmetric forcing .    the paper is organized as follows .",
