    "the interest in the starobinsky model for inflation @xcite has been revived , since it appears to be consistent with current cosmological data obtained by the planck satelite @xcite .",
    "the original model can be recast as an @xmath4 theory of gravity , where @xmath5 .",
    "another important feature of the starobinsky model is linked with renormalizability , since the renormalizability of this theory appears to be improved when compared to einstein s gravity @xcite .",
    "also , in both supergravity and superstring theories , polynomial corrections to the einstein - hilbert action are expected to appear , and so the starobinsky model can be seen as the first - order correction of a more general effective theory .    among the many proposals to extend einstein s gravity ,",
    "the so - called @xmath4 theories have deserved some attention also due to the fact that they can model the observed acceleration of the universe without an @xmath6 @xmath7 cosmological constant [ for a review , see @xcite ] . in this context",
    ", the starobinsky model is probably the most natural extension to the einstein - hilbert action as an @xmath4 theory .",
    "thus , it is natural to wonder how a more generic polynomial for @xmath4 , such as @xmath8 , @xmath1 , will differ from the starobinsky model .",
    "inflationary results based on such extended starobinsky models have been recently studied in @xcite .",
    "our aim is to study these extended models for cosmic strings .",
    "one of the motivations for the inflationary theory was to explain the current density ( or absence ) of magnetic monopoles , a heavy and stable particle predicted to be generated at the early universe by mostly grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "magnetic monopoles are a particular example of a topological defect , a stable solution of classical fields where their stability is provided by topological arguments related to the vacuum manifold .",
    "another example of a topological defect is a comic string ( for a review , @xcite ) , an axially symmetric relic from phase - transitions ocurred at the early universe .",
    "if we believe that an effective theory will replace einstein s gravity , it is natural to study the formation and behaviour of topological defects in the context of it .",
    "despite the fact that the gravitational field far away from the cosmic string is null , it generates an angular deficit that can , in principle , be observed by their astrophysical ( and gravitational ) effects @xcite . until the present moment",
    ", no evidence of the existence of cosmic strings has been obtained . as the angular deficit generated by the cosmic string is proportional to the scale of symmetry breaking ( the vacuum expected value or vev ) , the failure to detect such angular deficit constraints the possible range for the values of the vev . in @xcite",
    "one of us has shown that the starobinsky model of gravity allows a larger range of values for the vev than einstein s gravity , and then the starobinsky model can be a possible explanation of why we have not observed any evidence of such angular deficit yet .    in this paper we will study the same abelian higgs model for cosmic strings considered in @xcite , but now in a more general polynomial @xmath4 theory .",
    "axially symmetric solutions of more general @xmath4 theories of gravity have been studied in @xcite , but the results were obtained mainly for generic @xmath4 functions , or the equations were solved for a fixed energy - momentum tensor . to study the behaviour of the angular deficit and the cosmic horizon as functions of the parameters of the theory , in a dynamical higgs - maxwell - gravity environment , it is necessary to perform a numerical computation .",
    "this is done in the present paper .    one major difference between starobinsky and extended starobinsky models are the fact that the former can not generate or modify a cosmological constant term , but the latter can .",
    "we claim that these models should play a fundamental role in the strong curvature regime , such as near compact objects or in the primordial universe era , where it is expected that cosmic strings were generated during some phase transition .",
    "this result is independent of the gravitational theory considered .",
    "the string model we will use was first introduced by nielsen and olesen in 1973 as a field - theoretical model to mimic the features of the nambu - goto string , at the time a strong candidate to explain hadronic physics @xcite .",
    "the gravitational effects of this abelian higgs comic string were first analytically studied in @xcite for an idealized cosmic string , and numerically in @xcite . in the",
    "later , the einstein - maxwell - higgs equations were solved together , as it should be .",
    "since the coupled equations are highly non - linear , they must be solved numerically .",
    "a complete classification of the string - like solutions in einstein s gravity can be found in @xcite , and the same cosmic string in the starobinsky model has been studied in @xcite . our main goal in this paper is to extend these previous results for a polynomial @xmath4 theory .",
    "this paper in organized in the following manner . in section 2 we will present our model and the field equations to be solved , and in the following sections they will be solved numerically : in section 3 we will study the asymptotically flat case , and in section 4 we will deal with the asymptotically de sitter case . finally , in section 4 we will present the conclusions .",
    "the action for the gravitating abelian higgs system in this extended starobinsky model is given by    @xmath9 } \\label{action}\\ ] ]    where @xmath0 , with @xmath10 .",
    "as usual , @xmath11 is the abelian field strength , @xmath12 is a complex scalar field with vacuum expectation value @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the gauge covariant derivative and @xmath15 is the cosmological constant .",
    "we are using units were @xmath16 .",
    "if the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 are null , the above action reduces to the abelian higgs model in einstein s gravity with cosmological constant @xcite    because of the cylindrical symmetry of the source , and due to the symmetry under boosts along the string axis , we will consider the line element    @xmath17    and the usual nielsen - olesen ansatz given by @xcite    @xmath18 d\\phi .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we chose this ansatz so that the matter fields reach their vacuum expectation values at infinity when we impose the boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "if we vary the above action with respect to the scalar and gauge fields , respectively , we obtain the following set of field equations    @xmath19    where the symbol ( @xmath20 ) means derivative with respect to the radial coordinate .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor for the matter fields is given by @xmath21 , so that its components are    @xmath22    where    @xmath23    the gravitational field equations are obtained varying the action with respect to the metric @xmath24 , and are given by    @xmath25    where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this is a set of three non - zero independent fourth - order differential equations , but to avoid dealing with fourth - order differential equations we will consider the ricci scalar as an independent field . taking the trace of the above equations we find    @xmath29    first , let us point out that eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) tells us that the ricci scalar obeys a differential equation instead of a purely algebraic one , as occurs in general relativity .",
    "we can get some information considering a region far away from the string .",
    "assuming that @xmath30 and the cosmological constant vanishes , a constant curvature solution is given by    @xmath31    which means that we can , in principle , obtain a constant non - zero solution for the scalar curvature @xmath32 , if @xmath10 . this constant , however , will be proportional to the inverse of @xmath3",
    ". therefore , a small @xmath3 will result in a large @xmath32 . to be able to work with a small cosmological constant",
    ", we will insert the @xmath15 parameter . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the unique solution is the asymptotically flat case .    inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eqfield1 ] ) , we get    @xmath34    before we deal with the components of the above differential equations , we should redefine some variables as well as field , in such a way that all parameters are dimensionless . to achieve this goal we will express all lengths in terms of the scalar characteristic length scale given by @xmath35 . we will change our radial coordinate to a dimensionless coordinate @xmath36 , together with the field redefinitions @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we also introduce four new parameters , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "thus , we can write the field equations as    @xmath43    for the matter fields and    @xmath44,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath45,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath46.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the metric functions , where the primes @xmath47 in the above equations mean derivatives with respect to the new coordinate @xmath48 . equations ( [ eqqf ] ) and ( [ eqqp ] ) give us the dynamics of the matter fields , while eqs ( [ ch3:eqr ] ) to ( [ ch3:eql23 ] ) give us the behaviour of the metric fields as well as of the ricci scalar field .",
    "we must also impose the boundary conditions for all functions .",
    "as mentioned , in order to get string - like solutions the matter fields should reach their vacuum expectation values asymptotically .",
    "we must then impose the following boundary conditions    @xmath49    where infinity should be understood as a limit .",
    "the boundary conditions at the origin are necessary to have regular fields .    on the other hand , the boundary conditions for the metric functions are given by    @xmath50    which were imposed to guarantee the regularity of the metric .",
    "we must now impose the boundary conditions for the ricci scalar field .",
    "we are looking for asymptotically constant ricci spacetime , such as ( anti-)de sitter or minkowski .",
    "then , we will impose the following boundary conditions    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is a constant . in this case",
    ", we have two kinds of solutions .",
    "the first one is @xmath53 , as long as we also impose @xmath54 .",
    "this branch , which is asymptotically flat , will be studied in section 3 .",
    "the second branch is given by @xmath52 as a solution of eq .",
    "( [ solutionr ] ) with a cosmological constant . considering a small value for @xmath15 , we can write the constant ricci scalar as @xmath55 , since @xmath56 will be much smaller ( at least for reasonable values of @xmath3 ) . introducing this ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ solutionr ] ) and neglecting second - order terms in @xmath57 , we have    @xmath58    which gives us the boundary condition    @xmath59    we now have to solve a four parameter set of five differential equations with boundary conditions .",
    "as we can see , these equations are highly non - linear and will be solved numerically .",
    "the behaviour of such string was already studied in general relativity without a cosmological constant @xcite , with a cosmological constant @xcite and in the starobinsky model of gravity @xcite .",
    "our aim is to enlarge this study including more terms on a polynomial expansion with a cosmological constant .      in an asymptotically flat spacetime ,",
    "the geometry induced by the cosmic string far away from its core is a flat conical geometry .",
    "asymptotically , the metric functions are given by    @xmath60    where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are constants depending on @xmath64 and any other gravitational parameters .",
    "in our model , there are two parameters , namely @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in the absence of any source",
    "it is expected that @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 is proportional to the relation between the scalar and gauge masses , and does not strongly influences the asymptotically angular deficit .",
    "it is the parameter @xmath70 that considerably affects the space - time topology .",
    "in fact , if we fix @xmath69 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , as we vary @xmath70 we are in a way increasing the coupling between the matter fields and the gravitational field .",
    "as mentioned , the string - like solution gives rise to a planar deficit angle that can be expressed as    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is inversely proportional to @xmath70 .",
    "it is worth calling attention to the fact that we can increase @xmath70 until @xmath73 reaches @xmath74 , which means that @xmath75 .",
    "this value is called critical @xmath70 , @xmath76 , and for @xmath77 the spacetime is not globally well - defined in some models . let us remember that @xmath70 is directly related to the scale of the symmetry breaking .",
    "we can then use @xmath76 as a kind of constraint on the maximum scale for the occurrence of it . in a real world scenario",
    ", we should expect only a small value for the angular deficit to be allowed , otherwise its effects should already be noted . to deal with critical values , however , is useful for a better understanding of the properties of the theory .    in general relativity , which are given by @xmath78 , we can find the critical values for @xmath70 as a function of @xmath69 @xcite ,    @xmath79    in @xcite , one of us studied how this model is affected as we increase @xmath65 .",
    "the obtained result tell us that , for a fixed set of ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) , as @xmath65 gets bigger , the angular deficit becomes smaller .",
    "this means that the starobinsky model of gravity allows a large range for the values of the symmetry - breaking scale ( or vev ) .",
    "the angular deficit generated by a large vev will result , in the starobinsky model of gravity , in a smaller angular deficit than in general relativity .",
    "we can conclude that the failure to observe a conical geometry can be due to corrections on general relativity other than due to a small vev .",
    "our aim in the next two sections is to study how these results change as we extend the starobinsky model , including more terms in a polynomial expansion .",
    "the inclusion of a cosmological constant in the gravitational equations gives rise to a cosmological horizon , beyond which all events are not causally connected . in an axially symmetric space - time in vacuum",
    ", the horizon can be obtained by the line element ( [ metric ] ) with the metric functions given by    @xmath80    and @xmath81^{1/3 } \\left [ tan(\\sqrt{3\\lambda } \\frac{x}{2})\\right]^{2/3}.\\ ] ] this solution can be seen as the space - time generated by the cosmic string when @xmath82 . in this regime ,",
    "the matter fields decouple from the gravitational fields .",
    "the cosmological horizon is then given by the first zero of @xmath83 , which means @xmath84 .",
    "in general relativity , as we increase @xmath70 , the value of @xmath85 decreases . we will study how this result changes as we move from general relativity to the extended starobinsky model",
    "we have used a finite difference newton - raphson algorithm with adaptive grid scheme @xcite@xcite to construct the solutions numerically .",
    "our estimated errors range from @xmath86 to @xmath87 , sometimes even better .",
    "the limit @xmath88 , @xmath89 corresponds to general relativity , but we can not use both @xmath78 and @xmath90 in our analysis because the equations are not well defined at these values .",
    "the reason is that , in einstein s gravity , the ricci scalar obeys an algebraic relation with the energy - momentum tensor , not a differential equation .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the following two plots show a similar behaviour .",
    "as we increase the parameter @xmath66 , the cosmic horizon become smaller . however , the difference is more pronounced as @xmath91 . in the fourth graph ,",
    "the response of the metric function in respect to @xmath66 invert and the cosmic horizon starts to grow .",
    "the explanation for this inversion is in the fact that now we are dealing with two forces .",
    "as we increase the parameter @xmath66 , we are decreasing the effect of the matter fields in the geometry , just like in the original starobinsky model , and the cosmic horizon will grow up .",
    "but now we are also increasing the value of the cosmological constant , and the effect will be to decrease the value of the cosmic horizon .",
    "the relation between this two different effects will be related mostly to the parameter @xmath70 . for low @xmath70 ,",
    "the matter fields do no strongly influence the geometry , and the effect on the cosmological horizon will be predominant .",
    "the consequence is that the cosmic horizon will shrink . for a higher @xmath70 ,",
    "the influence of the matter on the geometry is big , and the major effect of the correction term will be to diminish this influence .",
    "the consequence is that the cosmic horizon will grown .",
    "it is expected that , for a large enough value for the parameter @xmath66 , the increase of the cosmological horizon will dominate over the diminishing of the coupling with the matter fields .",
    "the precise value where these transitions happens will also depend on the value of @xmath15 , since the scalar curvature is proportional to it .",
    "in this paper we have studied the abelian higgs cosmic string in the extended starobinsky model of gravity , with and without a cosmological constant term .",
    "such a model can be recast as an @xmath4 theory , where @xmath92 .",
    "the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 are adimensional , and general relativity is obtained when both goes to zero .",
    "the field equations were derived and solved numerically for several values of the parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath15 .",
    "we have worked out the powers @xmath93 and @xmath94 , but our focus was the powers @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    the obtained results were compared with the same system in general relativity . for the asymptotically flat case , our main interest was to study the behaviour of the angular deficit generated by the string , since its value can impose an upper constraint in the vacuum expected value for the scalar field .",
    "we found that the extended starobinsky model allows a large upper bound than einstein s gravity , since as we increase the parameter @xmath65 , the angular deficit become smaller .",
    "however , the effect of these extra terms , @xmath97 , with @xmath1 , are not as strong as the @xmath98 term , and the effect decreases as we increase the value of @xmath99 .",
    "we can then conclude that , for this particular regime , only the first terms in a power expansion are relevant in an effective theory of gravity .    for the asymptotically de sitter case we also compared our obtained results with the ones obtained in general relativity @xcite .",
    "our interest was to study the cosmic horizon , since it can also impose an upper bound in the vacuum expectation value .",
    "for the original starobinsky model , we have found that as we increase the value of the parameter @xmath65 , the cosmic horizon size approaches the same value as in the vacuum case , where the cosmic string decouples from gravity . in a regime with a large parameter @xmath65 , the value for the vev in not relevant for the size of the cosmic horizon .",
    "for the extended starobinsky model we have found another result .",
    "the main reason for this different behaviour is due to the fact that the @xmath97 term in the action , with @xmath1 is able to affect the boundary condition for the scalar curvature .",
    "this can be seen as a modification on the cosmological constant . because of this new effect , as we increase the parameter @xmath66 the cosmic horizon does change , but does not necessary approaches a non - singular asymptotically value . for a small vev , the main effect of the extended starobinsky model will be to decrease the cosmic horizon , since the contribution to enlarge the cosmological",
    "constant will dominate . for a large vev",
    ", the main effect of the same model , at least for @xmath100 , will be to increase the cosmic horizon , since the contribution to dilute the gravitational effect due to the cosmic string will dominate over the increasing in the cosmological constant .    in any case , if we believe that the extended starobinsky model can represent an effective theory for gravity , the upper bounds on the vacuum expectation value for the scalar field due to the ( possible ) existence of cosmic string , should be relaxed when compared with what would be the same bounds in general relativity .",
