    "first we discuss the intrinsic ly@xmath0 properties of agn .",
    "the kaspi relation @xcite relates the mass of the black hole powering the quasar , @xmath230 , to its continuum luminosity at 5100 @xmath231 we define the ratio @xmath232(1200 )]/@xmath233(5100 )]= @xmath234(1200 )]/@xmath235(5100  ) ] ( see   [ sec : lum ] ) .",
    "the template given by @xcite yields @xmath236 . for a given ly@xmath0 ew ,",
    "the ly@xmath0 luminosity is therefore uniquely determined by @xmath237 through @xmath238 where @xmath239 is in units of @xmath240 ergs s@xmath3 .",
    "the ly@xmath0 emission lines from agn are broader than those of galaxies . @xcite and @xcite found the half width at half maximum ( hwhm ) of the balmer lines to be related to the continuum luminosity at 5100  .",
    "if the same relation holds for the ly@xmath0 line , then its hwhm is given by @xmath241 note that the observations presented in @xcite ( their figure 7 ) suggest that @xmath242 does not increase beyond @xmath243 km s@xmath3 at low masses .    to obtain the agns observed properties in the ly@xmath0 line from the above relations , we require knowledge of the fraction of transmitted ly@xmath0-flux through the igm as a function of frequency .",
    "we first focus on the observed ly@xmath0 properties of agn at @xmath5 and @xmath65 .",
    "although the universe is fully reionised at @xmath52 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a trace quantity of neutral hydrogen is sufficient to scatter ly@xmath0 blueward of the ly@xmath0 line center out of our line of sight .",
    "for this reason the igm , to first order , erases the blue half of the ly@xmath0 line , so that the igm transmission is @xmath133 .",
    "various refinements of this scenario are possible .",
    "infall of the igm around massive objects causes the igm to erase a part of the red side of the ly@xmath0 line as well @xcite , which reduces @xmath132 . on the other hand , the proximity effect around these fainter agn increases @xmath132 .",
    "these two effects counteract each other , and ignoring both does not add a significant error to our estimate of @xmath132 .",
    "this is especially true when considering the large width of the ly@xmath0 line emitted by agn .",
    "when the igm erases the blue half of the ly@xmath0 line , the observed @xmath242 is reduced by a factor of 2 relative to the value in eq  ( [ eq : vfwhm ] ) . note that @xmath244 km s@xmath3 corresponds to an observed fwhm of @xmath245 at @xmath5 (",
    "this value was used in   [ sec : numden ] ) . note that one has to be careful not to confuse the observed fwhm of the ly@xmath0 line with its ew",
    "( it may be particularly confusing since the observed rest - frame ew of agn are @xmath246  , comparable to the value of the observed fwhm here ) .    at @xmath53 ,",
    "the igm is believed to contain a significant fraction of neutral hydrogen @xcite . for ly@xmath0 sources embedded in a neutral igm",
    ", the damping wing of the gunn - peterson trough can extend to the red side of the line and erase a significant fraction of the total ly@xmath0 flux .",
    "however , this effect is reduced when the ly@xmath0 source is surrounded by an hii region @xcite .",
    "moreover , sources with sufficiently broad emission lines ( @xmath247 km s@xmath3 ) can remain detectable even in the absence of such an hii region @xcite . in appendix  [ app : trans ] we show that a representative number for the igm transmission @xmath132 for faint agn embedded in a neutral igm at @xmath53 is @xmath134 and that the observed @xmath242 is reduced , again by a factor of @xmath2482 relative to the value in eq  ( [ eq : vfwhm ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we show that the gunn peterson damping wing may cause the observed line center of agn at @xmath53 to be redshifted by up to @xmath249 km s@xmath3 relative to other emission lines ( see appendix  [ app : trans ] ) .    next , we write the total detectable ly@xmath0 flux of agn as @xmath250 in which @xmath251 for @xmath52 and @xmath252 for @xmath53 .",

    "eq  ( [ eq : fa ] ) shows that existing ly@xmath0 surveys could have detected agn powered by black holes with masses of @xmath259 at @xmath1 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : fa ] ) assumed that the kaspi - relations derived from observations of luminous agn also relate the black - hole mass to the ly@xmath0 luminosity for low luminosity agn .",
    "alternatively , if we assume that faint agn are powered by less massive black holes accreting at their eddington limit , then these black - holes are up to @xmath260 orders of magnitude less massive than those of the observed sdss quasars , yielding @xmath261 a few @xmath262 . combined with the above argument",

    "we assumed the ly@xmath0 equivalent width to be ew@xmath281  .",
    "the break at @xmath282 is the lyman break caused by the igm ; the ly@xmath0 forest reduces the mean flux blueward of the ly@xmath0 line by a factor of @xmath283 .",
    "this factor has been determined observationally and is @xmath284 at @xmath5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : mab ] ( and eq .  18 ) shows that agn with @xmath285 ergs s@xmath3 @xmath26 have a @xmath190 apparent magnitude of @xmath286 ( @xmath287  ) .",

    "therefore , with the current selection criteria , the ly@xmath0 survey performed by @xcite only probes agn in the luminosity range @xmath291 $ ] , with @xmath191 ( this luminosity was used in   [ sec : selcon ] ) .",
    "x - rays provide a reliable pointer to agn activity . using the @xcite template",
    ", we calculate the ratio of detectable ly@xmath0 and x - ray flux ( in the observed 0.5 - 10.0 kev band ) @xmath292 this ratio changes by less than @xmath293 between @xmath1 .",
    "the total x - ray flux in the observers 0.5 - 10.0 kev band is @xmath294 times higher than the total ly@xmath0 flux .",
    "for example , an agn with a detected ly@xmath0 flux of @xmath295 ergs s@xmath3 @xmath26 is expected to have an x - ray flux of @xmath296 ergs s@xmath3 @xmath26 .",
    "this lies slightly below the quoted 3@xmath297 detection limit in the x - ray observations of individual ly@xmath0 emitter candidates presented by @xcite ( @xmath298 ergs s@xmath3 @xmath26 in the 0.5 - 10.0 kev band ) .",
    "therefore , even if agn were in the sample , these x - ray observations would not necessarily have revealed them (   [ sec : numden ] ) .",
    "also , provided the fraction of agn is @xmath299 (   [ sec : spec ] ) , these would not have appeared in the stacked x - ray image , since stacking 101 images increases the noise by @xmath300 , whereas the x - ray signal from agn would increase by @xmath301 .",
    "the signal  to  noise ratio would thus be conserved at best .",
    "similarly , the total x - ray flux in the observers 0.5 - 2.0 kev band is @xmath302 times higher than the total ly@xmath0 flux .",
    "it may come as a surprise then , that our constraints are fainter than those inferred from the _ chandra deep field_. the x - ray detection threshold in the _ chandra deep field north _ in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band is @xmath303 ergs s@xmath3 @xmath26 , which would correspond to a ly@xmath0 flux of @xmath304 ergs s@xmath3 @xmath26 , well below the sensitivity limit of @xmath305 ergs s@xmath3 @xmath26 in the survey performed by @xcite .",
    "however , estimates of the photometric redshifts for the x - ray sources require that they be bright enough to be detected in the subaru sloan z band ( which is centered on @xmath306  ) .",
    "this imposes a flux limit corresponding to ab magnitudes of the x - ray sources in the sloan z band that are below @xmath307 . using the quasar template , we find that this excludes agn with b - band luminosities less than @xmath308 , which agrees very well with the lower luminosity bound of the faint x - ray bin in   [ sec : selcon ] .",
    "the previous discussion demonstrates an observational bias against identification of high redshift faint agn in deep x - ray observations . within narrow redshift windows",
    ", this bias could be alleviated by combining x - ray observations with deep ly@xmath0 observations , since the detection of a ly@xmath0 line would determine the agn s redshift .",
    "similarly , the bias against identifying bright agn in wide field ly@xmath0 surveys (   [ sec : broadagn ] ) could be alleviated in combination with deep x - ray observations .",
    "these points illustrate the utility of combining deep x - ray and ly@xmath0 observations to identify faint agn , provided the sensitivities in each observation probe the same population of agn .",
    "we have shown that at @xmath5 and below @xmath309 , the quasar b - band luminosity function rises more slowly towards lower luminosities , @xmath310@xmath311 ( 95% confidence level ) , than has been observed at higher luminosities and lower redshifts , where @xmath310@xmath312 @xcite .",
    "this flattening of the faint end of the luminosity function towards higher redshift is consistent with the recent work by @xcite , who found that @xmath310@xmath313 at @xmath314 .",
    "we find marginal evidence ( @xmath315 confidence level ) that , in fact , the luminosity function falls towards lower luminosities below @xmath309 .",
    "this finding is in contrast to observations at higher luminosities .",
    "moreover the observed number counts lie well below the model predictions of wyithe & loeb 2003 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lumfunc ] ) .",
    "this may be explained in three ways :    \\1 ) our work has focused on the luminosity function of broad - lined agn ( type i ) , which in the unified model for agn are the same as type ii agn ( e.g. norman et al , 2002 ) , but unobscured by the thick absorbing torus .",
    "@xcite has shown that the fraction of type i agn increases with luminosity , which is supported theoretically by the receding torus model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this would imply that a luminosity function that incorporates both type i and ii agn does not flatten as much at @xmath5 as shown in figure  [ fig : lumfunc ] . however , to fully explain the observed flattening of the luminosity function requires the fraction of type 1 agn to decrease by @xmath316 orders of magnitude between log@xmath317=10 $ ] and @xmath318 .",
    "since this luminosity dependence of the type i agn fraction is much stronger than has been observed , this is very unlikely .",
    "\\2 ) gas accretion onto black holes in the mass - range @xmath11 is suppressed .",
    "one origin of this suppression may be negative agn feedback .",

    "however , @xcite have shown that supernova driven gas loss as a result of the first burst of star formation becomes significant in halos with @xmath324 km s@xmath3 .",

    "used the rareness of black holes with masses @xmath328 as a possible explanation for their model of the luminosity function of radioloud quasars to overpredict the abundance of faint radio sources , by one - two orders of magnitude .",
    "the possible reduction in the number of black holes with masses @xmath328 , may reflect the existence of a minimum super massive black hole mass , as envisioned in some formation scenarios ( e.g. * ? ? ? * in which the minimum black hole mass would be @xmath329 ) .",
    "our finding that at @xmath5 the qlf flattens more than previously believed for log@xmath317\\lsim 11 $ ] also implies that faint agn contribute less photons to the ionising background than previously thought .",
    "however , this is only a small effect since the total ionising photon output from agn per unit volume is @xmath330 . for @xmath331 ,",
    "this integral is dominated by luminous agn",

    "however , if quasar activity decreases with decreasing black hole mass ( as our results suggest ) , and if this trend continues into the miniquasar - realm , then it follows that miniquasars would not be efficient producers of ionizing radiation and would not have contributed significantly to the ionizing background .",
    "it is worth emphasising that this miniquasar - realm may be accessible with existing deep spectroscopic surveys of gravitationally lensed regions @xcite . in these surveys ,",
