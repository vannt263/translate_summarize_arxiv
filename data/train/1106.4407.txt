    "the holographic principle  @xcite provides a novel visual angle to deal with problems of quantum gravity .",
    "it allows us to study the quantum gravity without quantizing the gravity itself directly , but instead , to find a lower dimensional equivalently dual field theory which contains the same information as that of the gravity .",
    "however , until now there are only few explicit realizations of the holographic principle which have been constructed , for examples the ads@xmath0/cft@xmath1  @xcite and the ads@xmath2/cft@xmath3  @xcite correspondences .",
    "recent progress made along this direction was initiated from the study of the holographic description of the extremal kerr black hole  the kerr / cft correspondence  @xcite , which showed that the near horizon extremal kerr ( nhek ) black hole is dual to the chiral part of a 2d cft with central charge @xmath4 and temperature @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the angular momentum of the kerr black hole .",
    "this work was later generalized to the near - extremal and nonextremal kerr black holes by analyzing the scattering amplitudes of probe fields both from the gravity and the dual cft sides  @xcite .",
    "the nhek geometry containing an ads@xmath3 factor together with an @xmath7 bundle belongs to the warped ads@xmath2 geometry , thus the kerr / cft correspondence is a kind of the warped ads@xmath2/cft@xmath3 duality . for extension to other spacetimes which contain a warped ads@xmath2 structure ,",
    "see the recent review  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the method in the kerr / cft correspondence , however , can not be directly applied to non - rotating charged black holes , e.g. , the 4d reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black hole , which only contains an apparent ads@xmath3 geometry in the extremal limit , while the @xmath7 bundle is nontrivially encoded in the electromagnetic potential . to study its corresponding cft dual ,",
    "so far there are two possible approaches .",
    "one is to embed the rn black hole into a higher dimensional spacetime , where part of the background @xmath8 gauge field forms an extra @xmath7 circle which acts like a kind of rotation in higher dimensional spacetime , and the related analysis can be classified as the kerr / cft type , i.e. the warped ads@xmath2/cft@xmath3 correspondence  @xcite . another way ,",
    "following the kerr case studied in  @xcite , is to reduce the 4d extremal rn black hole into 2d and then to analyze its 2d effective action based on the boundary counterterm method in the ads@xmath3/cft@xmath9 correspondence  @xcite .",
    "these two approaches reveal different sections of the dual cft : the former one for the left - moving sector and the latter one for the right - moving sector .",
    "this interpretation was further confirmed by the studies of cft dual for the nonextremal rn black hole based on the fact that there exists a hidden 2d conformal symmetry in the background geometry which can be probed by a scalar field at low frequencies  @xcite .    to what extent",
    "shall we believe in this cft description for black holes ? as we have mentioned in the beginning , the holographic principle tells us the dual field theory should contain the same information as that of the gravity .",
    "that means the generating functionals of the two theories are equivalent .",
    "in other words , besides the matching of entropies of the black hole and the cft , the @xmath10-point correlation functions need also match with each other .",
    "however , until now only 2-point ( absorption cross section of scattering ) and 3-point  @xcite correlation functions have been checked .",
    "the matching of higher point correlators are expected but it requires further study .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give a brief introduction to the 4d rn black hole and its 5d uplifted counterpart , and then in section iii , we describe the cft dual of the ( near-)extremal rn black hole in the warped ads@xmath2/cft@xmath3 and in the ads@xmath3/cft@xmath9 correspondences , respectively . in section iv",
    ", we move to the cft dual for nonextremal rn black hole , by probing the hidden conformal symmetry .",
    "finally , we come to the summary and discussion .",

    "note that the size of the extra dimensional circle @xmath28 is in principle a free parameter , thus solution ( [ nhrn5 ] ) contains a warped ads@xmath37 geometry in general ( when @xmath38 , it becomes ads@xmath37 ) . in the near extremal limit , @xmath39 the symbol",

    "in this section , we will review the cft description for the ( near-)extremal 4d rn and 5d uplifted rn black holes . here",
    "we will only introduce the basic idea and list the main results , for detailed calculation , please refer to  @xcite .",
    "after embedding the 4d rn black hole into 5d , the near horizon extremal geometry  ( [ nhrn5 ] ) contains the warped ads@xmath2 structure , thus the studying of its dual cft@xmath3 description is rather straightforward .",
    "one can use the techniques in the kerr / cft correspondence to calculate the left hand central charge and the left hand temperature @xmath42 for generality , it is convenient to keep the parameter @xmath28 , while the authors in  @xcite simply chose a particular value of @xmath43 and the other typical choice @xmath38 has been adopted in  @xcite . using the cardy formula , one can check that the cft entropy reproduces the correct black hole entropy @xmath44    we can further check this warped ads@xmath2/cft@xmath3 correspondence of the 4d rn black hole at the level of the 2-point correlation function in the near - extremal limit  @xcite . from the gravity side this is simply the absorption cross section of probe fields . for a massless and neutral scalar field of the form",
    "@xmath45 the solution of the angular part is just the spherical harmonics @xmath46 , and the absorption cross section can be computed for a particular limit @xmath47 as @xmath48 where the parameters are defined as @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the ingoing flux at the horizon , while @xmath51 is the ingoing flux at spatial infinity . together with the left and right hand temperatures of the dual 2d cft @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    from the cft side",
    ", the absorption cross section corresponds to the 2-point function of the operator dual to the bulk probed scalar field @xmath54 where the conformal weight of the dual operator is @xmath55 and @xmath56 the absorption cross sections  ( [ sigma ] ) and  ( [ cftp ] ) match with each other by identifying the parameters @xmath57 and @xmath58      the action  ( [ emaction ] ) of the 4d near horizon extremal rn black hole can be reduced to the 2d effective one @xmath59}^2 \\right),\\ ] ] by the following ansatz @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the 2d ricci scalar associated with @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the dilaton field and @xmath64 is the @xmath8 gauge field strength . the 2d effective action  ( [ 2daction ] ) is a classical gravitational theory which needs a regularization by adding suitable boundary counterterms .",
    "this process is equivalent to making a renormalization in the cft side to ensure normalized stress tensor and current . for the precise implementation ,",

    "the normalized boundary stress tensor and currents are defined by @xmath73 the right hand central charge of the dual 1d cft can be obtained from the variation of @xmath74 with respect to a suitable combination of the diffeomorphism and the @xmath8 gauge transformations  @xcite , and the result is @xmath75 \\left ( 1 - \\sqrt{f } \\ , \\mathrm{e}^{-r / q } \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing with the expected transformation for 1d cft  @xcite @xmath76 where a dimension of length parameter @xmath77 is needed to ensure the central charge to be dimensionless . actually , this parameter @xmath77 can not be fixed only from the 2d effective theory .",
    "it is associated with the radius @xmath28 of the `` internal '' circle to accommodate the background @xmath8 gauge field ; a reasonable choice is @xmath78 .",
    "then the central charge is read out to be @xmath79 since there is no gravitational anomaly , similar to the near extremal kerr black hole case  @xcite , @xmath80 should equal to @xmath81 .",
    "in addition , the left hand temperature of the dual cft can be calculated from probing the 2d conformal symmetry of the near horizon extremal rn black hole background by a charged scalar field , which gives @xmath82 . then using the cardy formula , @xmath83",
    "the correct black hole entropy is reproduced .",
    "having discussed the dual cft description of the ( near-)extremal rn black hole , it is natural to ask what is the holographic dual description for the general nonextremal rn black hole .",
    "however , this is not an easy problem since there are no apparent ads structures in the near horizon geometry of nonextremal rn black holes . the background conformal symmetry ,",
    "if it still exists , has been hidden .",
    "inspired from the experience of studying the scattering process of probe fields in the black hole background , it was found that a 2d hidden conformal symmetry actually can be probed by a massless neutral scalar field propagating in the nonextremal kerr black hole background in the low frequency limit  @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will show how this hidden conformal symmetry can be extracted from the generic nonextremal rn black hole .",
    "like the extremal case , probing of the hidden conformal symmetry in the 5d uplifted rn black hole background  ( [ rn5metric ] ) is similar to that of the 4d kerr black hole background .",
    "consider a bulk massless scalar field @xmath84 propagating in the background of  ( [ rn5metric ] ) , after making the field decomposition of  ( [ aphi5 ] ) , the radial part of the klein - gordon ( kg ) equation can be simplified into  @xcite @xmath85 ^ 2}{(r - r_+)(r_+ - r_- ) } - \\frac{\\left [ ( 2 m r_- - q^2 ) \\omega - ( q r_-/\\ell ) k \\right]^2}{(r - r_-)(r_+ - r_- ) } \\biggr ] r = l ( l + 1 ) r.\\ ] ] where @xmath86 , under the conditions of ( a ) low frequency and low momentum limit @xmath87 ( automatically implies @xmath88 ) , and ( b ) near region limit of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "it turns out that the eq .",
    "( [ nhreq ] ) is indeed of the same form with the casimir operator of the @xmath91 lie algebra @xmath92 where @xmath93 . here",
    "( [ casimir1 ] ) is obtained from the standard casimir operator in the poincar coordinates ( @xmath94 ) by the following coordinate transformation @xmath95.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "one motivation for making the above coordinate transformation is that it transforms the poincar ads@xmath2 spacetime into the rotating btz black hole by simply replacing @xmath96 with @xmath97 . comparing eq .",
    "( [ nhreq ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ casimir1 ] ) , one obtains @xmath98 and the conformal weights of the operator dual to the bulk scalar field @xmath99 .",
    "even though we can determine the temperatures and conformal weights of the dual cft , we still do nt know how to calculate the central charges in the nonextremal case .",
    "however , if we simply assume that the central charges hold the same form as those in the extremal limit , i.e. @xmath100 , then the cardy formula indeed gives the correct black hole entropy @xmath101    in addition , the absorption cross sections calculated from the gravity side is  @xcite @xmath102 where @xmath103 finally , the @xmath104 matches with the finite temperature absorption cross section of the operator dual to the scalar field in a 2d cft .",
    "it would be interesting to find a 2d hidden conformal symmetry for the nonextremal 4d rn black hole , without uplifting it into 5d . this will give further evidence that the 4d rn black hole is dual to a 2d cft .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the 2d hidden conformal symmetry does exist in this case ; the key point is that the @xmath8 bundle of the 4d dyonic rn black hole can be probed by a charged scalar field .",
    "this can be expected since the @xmath8 symmetry is actually associated with the gauge symmetry of the background gauge field  @xcite .",
    "the charged scalar field @xmath84 with charge @xmath105 in 4d dyonic rn black hole background can be decomposed as @xmath106 , then in the near region @xmath89 , together with the low frequency and small probe charge limit , the radial part of the kg equation becomes    @xmath107 r = l ( l + 1 ) r,\\ ] ]    where @xmath108 are the gauge potentials at the outer / inner horizons . in the dyonic black hole of electric and magnetic charges",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath109 , the radii of the inner and outer horizons are @xmath110 .    to compare the eq .",
    "( [ scalareq ] ) with the casimir operator  ( [ casimir1 ] ) , we should introduce an operator @xmath111 , which can be naturally considered to act on the `` internal '' @xmath8 symmetry space of the probe electrically charged scalar field as @xmath112 .",
    "then the temperatures of the dual cft are @xmath113 again , one assume the central charges are identical to those of the extremal 4d rn black hole , namely , @xmath114 then one again gets @xmath115    the rn / cft@xmath3 correspondence can be further checked by studying the scattering of the probe charged scalar field in the rn black hole background .",
    "we will see that the absorption cross section of the scalar field is in agreement with the two point function of its corresponding operators in the dual 2d cft .",
    "the absorption cross section calculated from the gravity side is of the same form as eq .",
    "( [ absgr ] )  @xcite .",
    "we can also check the real - time correlators .",
    "the two - point retarded correlator obtained from the gravity side is simply @xmath116 with @xmath117 , the explicit form of other parameters can be found in @xcite .    from the 2d cft side ,",
    "the retarded green function @xmath118 can be calculated by an analytic continuation from the euclidean correlator @xmath119 ( where @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 ) by @xmath124 and the euclidean frequencies @xmath125 and @xmath126 should take discrete values of the matsubara frequencies at finite temperature @xmath127 in which @xmath128 are integers for bosons and half integers for fermions . at these frequencies",
    ", we can see that the retarded green function matches well with the gravity side computation  ( [ greenr ] ) up to a normalization factor depending on the charges @xmath129 and @xmath130 , i.e. the electric charge of the probe scalar field .",
    "in this short article , we give a brief review of recent progress in the holographic description of the rn black hole , for all the extremal , near extremal and nonextremal cases .",
    "we show that , the warped ads@xmath2/cft@xmath3 and the ads@xmath3/cft@xmath9 descriptions are consistent , which means that the 4d rn black hole is dual to a 2d cft , and indicates that 1d cft is actually the chiral part of a 2d cft .",
    "this rn / cft@xmath3 duality is supported from the matching of entropies , the absorption cross sections and the real - time correlators calculated both from the gravity and the dual 2d cft side .",
    "nevertheless , there are still some unsolved problems such as why does the method of probing hidden conformal symmetry work",
    "? can we calculate the central charges of the dual cft in the nonextremal limit ?",
    "do the @xmath10-point correlators match with each other ?",
    "further clarification of these important issues is desirable .",
