    "the existence of an almost scale - invariant spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations on large scales is one of the most important observations that any model for the early universe should explain .",
    "an inflationary expansion in the very early universe is most commonly assumed to achieve this , but it is important to consider whether there is any alternative model . in this paper",
    "we focus on the ekpyrotic scenario as an alternative @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the old ekpyrotic scenario ,",
    "the large scale perturbations are supposed to be generated during a collapse driven by a single scalar field with a steep negative exponential potential .",
    "it was shown that the newtonian potential acquires a scale - invariant spectrum , but the comoving curvature perturbation has a steep blue spectrum @xcite . in this scenario",
    "we need a mechanism to convert contraction to expansion , and for a regular four - dimensional bounce , the scale - invariant newtonian potential is matched to the decaying mode in an expanding universe , and the growing mode of curvature perturbations acquires a steep blue spectrum @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that this conclusion might be altered by allowing a singular matching between collapse and expanion @xcite , but the general rule that the comoving curvature perturbation remains constant still holds for adiabatic perturbations on large scales @xcite . in a braneworld context , the conversion from contraction to expansion might be accomplished by a collision of two branes where one of extra - dimensions disappears @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the scale - invariant newtonian potential can be transferred to the comoving curvature perturbations by this singular bounce @xcite .",
    "however , without having a concrete theory to describe the singularity , it is difficult to have a definite conclusion on how perturbations pass through the singularity .",
    "recently , there has been some progress in generating a scale invariant spectrum for curvature perturbations in the ekpyrotic scenario @xcite , by considering non - adiabatic perturbations which has been suggested previously by ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "we require two or more fields .",
    "if these have steep exponential potentials then there exists a scaling solution where the energy density of the fields grow at the same rate during collapse @xcite .",
    "the isocurvature perturbations then have a scale - invariant spectrum @xcite .",
    "these isocurvature perturbations can be converted to curvature perturbations if there is a sharp turn in the trajectory in field space @xcite .",
    "for example ref .",
    "@xcite considered a situation where one of the fields changes its direction in field space , which corresponds to a time when a negative tension brane is reflected by a curvature singularity in the bulk , in the context of the heterotic m - theory .",
    "@xcite considered a regular bounce realized by a ghost condensate .",
    "one of the fields exits the ekpyrotic phase and hits the transition to the ghost condensate phase that creates a sharp turn in the trajectory in field space and curvature perturbations can be generated @xcite .",
    "it is still necessary to match curvature perturbations in a contracting phase to those in an expanding universe , but it is shown that the comoving curvature perturbation is conserved on large scales resulting in an almost scale - invariant spectrum observed today for a regular bounce like a ghost condensate model @xcite .",
    "the isocurvature perturbations behave like @xmath2 on large scales .",
    "as the hubble parameter is rapidly increasing in a collapsing universe , this signals an instability .",
    "in fact it is easy to see that we always require an instability of this form in order to generate a scale - invariant spectrum with a canonical scalar field during collapse . as the amplitude of field perturbations at hubble exit are of order @xmath3 , we require the super - hubble perturbations to grow at the same rate to maintain a scale - invariant spectrum . ref .",
    "@xcite studied this instability in a phase space analysis .",
    "the multi - field scaling solution was shown to be a saddle point in field space and the late - time attractor is the old ekpyrotic collapse dominated by a single - field . a tachyonic instability drives the scaling solution towards the late - time attractor (",
    "see also @xcite ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we pointed out that the natural turning point in the field space trajectory due to the instability of the scaling solution might itself offer the possibility of converting the scale invariant spectrum of isocurvature field perturbations into a scale invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations . in this paper",
    ", we confirm this expectation by explicitly solving the evolution equations for perturbations in a two field model .",
    "we find that the ratio between curvature perturbations and isocurvature perturbations at the final old ekpyrotic phase is solely determined by the ratio of exponents of the two exponential potentials , and the amplitude is set by the hubble rate at the transition time .",
    "we first review the background dynamics of the fields . during the ekpyrotic collapse",
    "the contraction of the universe is assumed to be described by a 4d friedmann equation in the einstein frame with scalar fields with negative exponential potentials @xmath4 where [ vi ] v = - _ i v_i e^-c_i_i , and we take @xmath5 and set @xmath6 equal to unity .    the authors of @xcite found a scaling solution ( previously studied in @xcite ) in which both fields roll down their potential as the universe approaches a big crunch singularity . in this ekpyrotic scaling collapse",
    "we find a power - law solution for the scale factor [ scalingp ] a ( -t)^p ,  p = _ i < 13 , where [ backgroundij ] = = . as we will see in the next section , it is possible to generate scale - invariant isocurvature perturbations around this background .",
    "however , the ekpyrotic scaling solution ( [ backgroundij ] ) is unstable .",
    "in addition to the scaling solution we have fixed points corresponding to any one of the original fields @xmath7 dominating the energy density where the other fields have negligible energy density .",
    "these correspond to the original ekpyrotic power - law solutions where a ( -t)^p_i , p_i = , for @xmath8 .",
    "we find that any of these single field dominated solutions is a stable local attractor at late times during collapse .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ekpyrotic scaling solution ( [ backgroundij ] ) was shown to be a saddle point in the phase space .",
    "we briefly review the phase space analysis . introducing phase space variables",
    "@xcite @xmath9 the first order evolution equations for the phase space variables are given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "the friedmann equation gives a constraint @xmath12 there are @xmath13 fixed points of the system where @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 in this paper , we focus on the fixed points @xmath16 and @xmath17 assuming @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the linearized analysis shows that the multi - field scaling solution , @xmath16 , always has one unstable mode .",
    "on the other hand , the single field dominated fixed points , @xmath17 , are always stable .    from now on",
    "we concentrate our attention on two fields case .",
    "then we have three fixed points @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) plane , the fixed points @xmath16 , @xmath24 and @xmath21 are connected by a straight line , which is given by @xmath25 the eigenvector associated with the unstable mode around the scaling solution @xmath16 lies in the same direction as the line ( [ instability ] ) .",
    "thus this is an attractor trajectory , which all solutions near @xmath16 approach .",
    "1 shows numerical solutions for the evolution of @xmath22 .",
    "initial positions in the phase space are perturbed away from @xmath16 along the line ( [ instability ] ) .",
    "the solutions go to @xmath24 or @xmath21 , depending on the initial position in the phase space .",
    "an important observation is that , as we follow phase space trajectories during the transition from the scaling solution @xmath16 to the attractor solutions @xmath24 or @xmath21 , the solutions obey the relation eq .",
    "( [ instability ] ) , even far away from the saddle point , @xmath16 . using the friedmann equation and the field equations",
    ", we can show that @xmath26 and hence @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an integration constant . in terms of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , eq .",
    "( [ instability ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath31 and hence we see that for trajectories starting from point @xmath16 we have @xmath32 , which is the late time attractor . thus we see that eq .",
    "( [ instabilityf ] ) holds even during the transition caused by the tachyonic instability from point @xmath16 to @xmath24 or @xmath21 and in the final single - field dominated phase .",
    "this fact will be important when we study perturbations .    .",
    "the horizontal axis is @xmath33 and we take @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the initial time is @xmath36 .",
    "note that @xmath37 decreases towards the future in a collapsing universe .",
    "right : the corresponding phase space trajectories in @xmath38 plane.,width=642 ]    we will study the behaviour of perturbations during the transition in the next section .",
    "in this section , we consider inhomogeneous linear perturbations around the background solution .",
    "we consider the scalar field perturbations on spatially flat hypersurfaces .",
    "then the scalar field perturbations are given by @xcite @xmath39 we can decompose the perturbations into the instantaneous adiabatic and entropy field perturbations as follows @xcite : @xmath40 the adiabatic field perturbation @xmath41 is the component of the two - field perturbation along the direction of the background fields evolution while the entropy perturbation @xmath42 represents fluctuations orthogonal to the background classical trajectory .",
    "the adiabatic field perturbation leads to a perturbation in the comoving curavture perturbation : @xmath43 whereas the entropy field perturbations correspond to isocurvature perturbations .",
    "their evolution equations are given by @xcite @xmath44 \\delta r = 2 \\dot{\\theta } \\dot{\\delta s } + 2 \\left [ \\ddot{\\theta } - \\left(\\frac{v_{,r}}{\\dot{r } } + \\frac{\\dot{h}}{h } \\right ) \\dot{\\theta } \\right ] \\delta s,\\ ] ] @xmath45,\\ ] ] where the angle @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 such that @xmath48 and @xmath49    for the multi - field scaling solution , @xmath16 , we have @xmath50 and for the single field scaling solutions we have @xmath51 thus we have @xmath52constant for the fixed points and the adiabatic and the entropy fields are decoupled .",
    "this allows us to quantise the independent fluctuations in the two fields .    for the multi - field scaling solution @xmath16 , the spectrum of quantum fluctuations of the entropy field is given on large scales ( @xmath53 ) by [ pdeltachi ] p_s |s^2| = c_^2 ( -k)^1 - 2 , where @xmath54 is conformal time , and @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the spectral tilt is given by n _ , to leading order in a fast - roll expansion ( @xmath57 ) @xcite . in this limit",
    ", the spectrum ( [ pdeltachi ] ) can be written as @xmath58 note that @xmath59 is rapidly increasing and thus @xmath42 is also growing on super - hubble scales due to the tachyonic instability .",
    "this instability is essential in order to realize the scale invariance of the spectrum ( [ ps ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of field perturbations at hubble exit is of order @xmath3 and thus we require the super - hubble perturbations to grow at the same rate in order to maintain a scale - invariant spectrum .    note that in the simplest model , the spectrum is slightly blue @xcite .",
    "however , any deviations from an exponential potential for adiabatic field can introduce the corrections to the spectral tilt and thus it becomes model dependent @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of quantum fluctuations in the adiabatic field about the scaling solution has the same power - law form on large scales @xmath60 where to @xmath61 to leading order in @xmath62 .",
    "thus the adiabatic field perturbations become constant in the large scale limit and the spectral tilt is given by @xmath63 thus we have @xmath64 and hence in what follows we can neglect the adiabatic field fluctuations in the large - scale limit .",
    "by contrast , for the single field dominated scaling solutions , the adiabatic and entropy field perturbations are both frozen on super - hubble scales : @xmath65 these perturbations both have a steep blue spectrum if they cross the horizon when the background solutions are described by the single field dominated solution @xcite .",
    "now let us consider the evolution of perturbations in a situation where the classical solution starts from near the saddle point , @xmath16 . as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite this requires an additional preceding mechanism that drives the classical background solution to the unstable saddle point throughout our observable part of the universe . in this paper , we will not discuss the mechanism required to bring the classical solution to the saddle point and we just assume that the classical solution stays near the saddle point for long enough to ensure that a scale - invariant spectrum of isocurvature perturbations is generated over the relevant scales for the observed large scale structure of our universe .",
    "then the initial conditions for the adiabatic and the entropy field perturbations can be set from the amplitude of quantum fluctuation as described in the previous section : @xmath66 on sufficiently large scales and for @xmath67 .    unless the spatially homogeneous background solution is located exactly at the fixed point , the tachyonic instability drives the background solution away from the multi - field scaling solution , @xmath16 , to one of the single field dominated solutions , @xmath24 or @xmath21 , depending on the initial conditions . during the transition",
    "@xmath46 is not constant and the adiabatic and entropy field perturbations mix , so it is possible to generate perturbations in the adiabatic field , and hence comoving curvature perturbations ( [ rc ] ) , from initial fluctuations in the entropy field .",
    "we can solve the evolution equations ( [ evolr ] ) and ( [ evols ] ) numerically for any given classical background .",
    "figure  2 shows the behaviour of @xmath41 and @xmath42 . due to the coupling between @xmath41 and @xmath42 during the transition ,",
    "curvature perturbations are generated during the transition .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath42 shows a tachyonic instability according to eq .",

    "the final amplitude of @xmath41 depends on when the transition from @xmath16 to @xmath17 occurs , but , interestingly , the final ratio between @xmath41 and @xmath42 does not depend on the details of the transition .",
    "we find that the ratio is determined solely by the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 as @xmath70 as is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we will explain later why such a simple result is found .",
    ", using the same parameters as in figure  1 .",
    "the corresponding background solutions are shown in figure  1 .",
    "right : the ratio between @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the ratio approaches a constant given by eqs .",

    "the change of the curvature perturbations is determined by @xcite @xmath76 on large scales , we can neglect @xmath77 and it is possible to reproduce the previous results from eq .",
    "( [ curvaturepsi ] ) .",
    "although the physical meaning of the instantaneous adiabatic and entropy field perturbations is clear , the dynamics of the perturbations during the transition are rather complicated in this basis .",

    "the multi - field scaling solution corresponds to @xmath78 , while @xmath79 is rolling down the exponential potential .",
    "the potential for @xmath80 has a negative mass - squared around @xmath81 , and thus @xmath80 represents the instability direction . if the initial condition for @xmath80 is slightly different from @xmath82 or @xmath83 is not zero , then @xmath80 starts rolling down the potential and the solution approaches a single - field dominated solution .",
    "note that perturbations @xmath84 and @xmath85 coincide with the instantaeous adiabatic and entropy field perturbations respectively , defined in eq .",
    "( [ deltar ] ) , at the scaling solution , @xmath16 .",
    "thus we can use the initial perturbations ( [ initial ] ) due to vacuum fluctuations about the scaling solution previously calculated .",
    "however as we follow the evolution away from this saddle point we can no longer identify @xmath79 and @xmath80 with the adiabatic and entropy perturbations .",

    "we can then show that two of the effective mass terms become @xmath89 independently of the form of @xmath90 since @xmath91 .",
    "thus on large scales @xmath92 is constant .",
    "as we take @xmath93 as our initial condition , this remains so even during the transition and in the final single field dominated phase .",

    "<S> a scale - invariant spectrum of isocurvature perturbations is generated during collapse in the ekpyrotic scaling solution in models where multiple fields have steep negative exponential potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the scale invariance of the spectrum is realized by a tachyonic instability in the isocurvature field . </S>",
    "<S> this instability drives the scaling solution to the late time attractor that is the old ekpyrotic collapse dominated by a single field . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the transition from the scaling solution to the single field dominated ekpyrotic collapse automatically converts the initial isocurvature perturbations about the scaling solution to comoving curvature perturbations about the late - time attractor . </S>",
