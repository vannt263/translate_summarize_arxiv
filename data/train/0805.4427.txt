[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the growth of @xmath1 strongly suggests that the liquid state should be thought of as a mosaic of regions ( transiently ) ordered on a lengthscale @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , following suggestions based on rfot@xcite , it is natural to conjecture that we are probing the growth of positional amorphous order . interestingly , in this scenario , all finite point static correlations remain featureless , whereas the _ point - to - set _",
    "correlations @xcite , captured by @xmath17 , grow .",
    "the simplest version of rfot predicts at low temperature a sharp cross - over of @xmath17 for @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "our numerical results show that this is not what happens : the cross - over is much smoother than expected ( see also the recent work @xcite on a 1-@xmath38 kac model ) .",
    "to account for our numerical results , we now propose a natural generalization of rfot , based on the idea that the effective interface tension , @xmath10 , is in fact state - dependent .",
    "repeating the argument of ref .   with this extra assumption ,",
    "the probability that the cavity is found in a state @xmath7 different from the outside pinning ( frozen ) state @xmath6 , is : @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are respectively the free energy and configurational entropy of the equilibrium states , and @xmath43 is the distribution of surface tension for state @xmath6 with other states of free energy @xmath44 ( see methods ) .",

    "the growth of the length is caused by the decreasing of the configurational entropy at low temperature .",
    "the expression ( [ compressed - exp ] ) is the compressed exponential form ( [ pota ] ) used above to fit our numerical data . within this framework ,",
    "the thermodynamic anomaly @xmath73 is directly related ( at low temperatures ) to the exponent @xmath67 describing the surface tension distribution .",
    "a non trivial @xmath63 could arise for two main reasons .",
    "one is strong pre - asymptotic corrections to standard rfot : though the surface tension between two typical states could be self - averaging in the @xmath74 limit , fluctuations can be state dependent and important at finite @xmath0 .",
    "this is often what happens for interfaces in random media ( see si ) .",
    "the second possibility is that the effective interface tension fluctuates even in the large @xmath0 limit . if the exponent @xmath51 turns out to be less than @xmath52 , as suggested by phenomenological arguments in ref .",
    ", then the interface should be a highly fluctuating object as e.g. in the droplet theory of spin - glasses@xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath33 , and therefore @xmath67 , increase when @xmath75 decreases indicates that the crossover of @xmath17 becomes sharper at larger sizes ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : alltemps ] ) .",
    "this is compatible with a finite - size effect scenario .",
    "this behaviour is also expected within the rfot scenario that predicts a vanishing surface tension at the mode - coupling transition @xmath76 , which behaves as a spinodal point .",
    "coherent amorphous order droplets should therefore be fractal around @xmath76 and compact below @xcite , which suggests an increase of the effective value of @xmath67 as @xmath75 decreases . a first principle rfot computation of @xmath17 for the model we simulated would be very instrumental to clarify this issue .",
    "we have unveiled a qualitative difference between the high temperature and deeply super - cooled equilibrium regimes : the influence of boundary conditions propagates into the bulk on an increasingly large lengthscale upon cooling .",
    "furthermore , the growth of this length is accompanied by a sharpening of the decay .",
    "we have developed a theoretical framework , based on a generalization of rfot , that explains these results as a one - state to multi - state transition governed by the surface tension distribution .",
    "the sharpening of the decay at low temperature corresponds to more and more regions developing a large surface tension . from a more general perspective",
    ", our numerical results strongly support a mosaic picture where the super - cooled liquid is characterized by a `` hidden '' static order on an increasingly larger scale upon cooling .",
    "although this is a natural consequence of rfot , other theoretical approaches may also account for these phenomena at least on a qualitative level : in particular the frustration limited domain theory @xcite and , perhaps surprisingly , some kinetically constrained models ( see @xcite for a discussion of this point ) .",
    "the main difference is the physical origin of the growing static lengthscale : within rfot and at variance with other approaches , it is tightly linked to the decrease of the configurational entropy .",
    "our work opens the way to a quantitative study of this issue and , hence , to a clear - cut test of rfot as a valid theory of the glass transition . from a more theoretical point of view ,",
    "several crucial questions remain elusive : can a rfot - like transition exist outside mean - field ?",
    "how precisely can amorphous metastable states be defined ? does the notion of effective surface tension between these states make sense ?",
    "a definitive test of the mosaic scenario requires to find a way to measure _ directly _ this surface tension and its distribution in the deeply supercooled phase .",

    "now the integral in equations  ( [ eq : pout ] ) and  ( [ eq : pout - noalpha ] ) can be simplified using the saddle point method , which is a very good approximation even for rather small values of @xmath0 .",

    "i.e.  _ it vanishes for @xmath106 , one finds up to subleading terms : @xmath107 . otherwise : ( b ) there are arbitrarily small effective tensions @xmath10 .",
    "remarkably , in this case , depending on the form of @xmath50 at small @xmath10 , one can obtain a renormalization of @xmath51 .",
    "for instance in the case @xmath108 , where @xmath88 is a positive exponent , one finds @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is a constant dependent of the outside state @xmath6 and temperature and @xmath111 .",
