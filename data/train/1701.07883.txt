    "this paper provides a description of a new technique for studying magnetic fields using gradients of synchrotron intensity .",
    "gradients of synchrotron polarization have been successfully used before ( see @xcite ) . however , in this letter we explore theoretically and numerically a more simple measure , namely , synchrotron intensity gradients ( sigs ) and evaluate its utility for observational study of magnetic fields and accounting for the foreground contamination induced by the interstellar media within the cmb polarization studies .",
    "galactic and extragalactic synchrotron emission arises from relativistic electrons moving in astrophysical magnetic field ( see @xcite ) . in terms of cmb and high redshift hi studies ,",
    "the most important is galactic synchrotron emission .",
    "however , diffuse synchrotron emission is observed throughout the interstellar medium ( ism ) , the intracluster medium ( icm ) , as well as in the lobes of radio galaxies ( e.g. ) .",
    "thus synchroton emission provides the largest range of scales for studying magnetic fields .",
    "astrophysical magnetic fields are turbulent as observations testify that turbulence is ubiquitous in astrophysics @xcite . as",
    "relativistic electrons are present in most cases , the turbulence results in synchrotron fluctuations , which may provide detailed information about magnetic fields at different scales , but , at the same time , impede measures of cmb and high redshift hi .",
    "the latter has recently become a topic of intensive discussion ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the statistics of synchrotron intensity has been studied recently in @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter lp12 ) , where it was shown how fluctuations of synchrotron intensity can be related to the fluctuations of magnetic field for an arbitrary index of cosmic rays spectrum .",
    "there it was shown that the turbulence imprints its anisotropy on synchrotron intensity and this provides a way of determining the direction of the mean magnetic field using synchrotron intensities only .",
    "the current paper explores whether on the basis of our present - day understanding of the nature of mhd turbulence , _ synchrotron intensities _ can provide more detailed information about magnetic fields .    in",
    "what follows  2 we discuss the theoretical motivation of this work routed in the modern theory of the of mhd turbulence , the properties of synchrotron intensity gradients ( sigs ) , their calculation as well as the influence of noise and sonic mach number are discussed in  3 .",
    "the comparison of the sigs technique with the technique based on the anisotropy of the correlation functions of intensity is presented in  4 , the synergy with other techniques of magnetic field studies is outlined in  5 .",
    "we present our summary in  6 .",
    "while the original studies of alfvenic turbulence done by @xcite and @xcite were based a hypothetical model of isotropic mhd turbulence , the later studies ( see @xcite ) uncovered the anisotropic nature of the mhd cascade.the modern theory of mhd turbulence arises from the prophetic work by @xcite , henceforth gs95 ) .",
    "further theoretical and numerical studies ( @xcite , henceforth lv99 , @xcite , see @xcite for a a review ) extended the theory and augmented it with new concepts .",
    "our theoretical motivation for the present work is based on the modern understanding of the nature of mhd turbulence that we briefly summarize below .",
    "the gs95 theory treats the alfvenic turbulence .",
    "the numerical simulations in @xcite testify that for non - relativistic mhd turbulence the coupling between different types of fundamental modes is the effect that can be frequently neglected .",
    "therefore , in realistic compressible astrophysical media one can consider three distinct cascades , namely , the cascade of alfven , slow and fast modes .",
    "alfven modes initially evolve by increasing the perpendicular wavenumber in the subalfvenic regime , i.e. for the injection velocity @xmath0 being less than the alfven velocity @xmath1 , of weak turbulence , while the parallel wavenumber stays the same ( see lv99 , @xcite ) .",
    "this is not yet the regime of gs95 turbulence , but , nevertheless , the increase of the perpendicular wave number means the modes get more and more perpendicular to magnetic field . in alfvenic turbulence the magnetic field and velocity",
    "are symmetric and therefore the aforementioned situation means that both the gradients of magnetic field and velocity are getting aligned perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the weak alfvenic turbulence can be viewed as the interaction of wave packets with a fraction of the energy cascading as a result of such an interaction . as the perpendicular wavenumber increases ,",
    "this fraction gets larger and eventually becomes @xmath2 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is the maximal fraction of energy that can be transferred during the wavepacket interaction .",
    "however , the equations dictate the necessity of further increase of perpendicular wavenumber as the result of the interaction of the oppositely moving wavepackets .",
    "this can only be accomplished through the simultaneous increase of the parallel wavenumber .",
    "this happens at the transition scale @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the turbulence injection scale and @xmath5 is the alfven mach number ( see lv99 , @xcite ) .",
    "this is the stage of the transfer to the strong or gs95 regime of turbulence . at this stage",
    "the so - called critical balance condition should be satisfied , which states that the time of the interaction of the oppositely moving wavepackets @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the parallel to magnetic field scale of the wavepacket is equal to the perpendicular shearing time of the wavepacket @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the perpendicular scale of the wavepacket and @xmath10 is the turbulent velocity associated with this scale .",
    "this is how the cascade proceeds in the strong regime with the wavepackets geting more and more elongated according to ( lv99 ) : @xmath11 which testifies that for @xmath12 the parallel scale of the wavepackets gets much larger than the perpendicular scale , i.e. the wavepackets get more and more elongated as the perpendicular scale @xmath9 decreases .",
    "this means that both the velocity and magnetic field gradients get even more aligned perpendicular to the magnetic - field direction .",
    "this increase of the disparity of parallel and perpendicular scales continues until the energy reaches the dissipation scale .",
    "the magnetic field direction is changing in the turbulent flow .",
    "therefore the important question that arises is what the direction of magnetic field should be used in the arguments above .",
    "most of the earlier work assumed the perturbative approach and thus the mean field direction was used .",
    "this looks also to be an implicit assumption in gs95 study .",
    "however , in the works that followed groundbreaking gs95 paper ( namely , lv99 , @xcite ) , where it was shown that it is not correct to use the mean magnetic field , but one should use the _ local _ magnetic field that is sampled by the wavepacket .",
    "therefore the aforementioned gradients of the velocities and magnetic fields are aligned with the _ local _ magnetic field and therefore sample the local direction of the magnetic - field flux .",
    "this point is very important for the technique that we are going to propose .",
    "indeed , by measuring the velocity / magnetic field gradients one can trace magnetic field in 3d volume .",
    "a more complicated situation emerges in the case of superalfvenic turbulence , i.e. for @xmath13 . if @xmath14 the turbulence in this regime is dominated by hydrodynamic motions with magnetic field lines following the streamlines of the flow within large turbulent eddies .",
    "therefore both the velocity gradients and the magnetic field gradients are expected to be the largest when they are perpendicular to the streamlines .",
    "this means that both the velocity and magnetic field gradients are going to be perpendicular to the magnetic field in the flow . as the turbulence proceeds along the kolmogorov cascade , i.e. @xmath15 , the kinetic energy decreases . at the scale @xmath16 the kinetic energy",
    "gets into equipartition with the magnetic energy and thus the gs95 picture of trasalfvenic turbulence is applicable from the scale @xmath17 .",
    "naturally , our earlier considerations for the alignment of magnetic and velocity gradients with the local magnetic - field directions is applicable for the eddies with @xmath18 . at the same time",
    ", the large - scale hydrodynamic eddies can also compress magnetic field providing the alignment of magnetic field gradients perpendicular to the velocity gradients .",
    "we explore this numerically in the paper .",
    "we also note that in both subalfvenic and superalfvenic turbulence the magnitude of velocity gradients increase with the decrease of the scale .",
    "our considerations above testify that the same should happen with the magnetic field gradients as well . in other words ,",
    "magnetic field gradients are expected to reflect the smallest eddies that are well - aligned with the magnetic - field direction at the scale of these small eddies .",
    "the mhd cascade also contains slow and fast modes .",
    "the slow modes are slaved by alfvenic modes , that shear them both in the case of magnetically dominated ( low-@xmath19 ) and gas - pressure dominated ( high-@xmath19 ) plasmas ( gs95 , @xcite ) .",
    "thus we expect that the slow modes will also show the properties of the magnetic gradients similar to the alfven waves .",
    "the fast modes are different , however .",
    "they create an accustic - type cascade @xcite which marginally cares about magnetic - field direction .",
    "however , numerical simulations show that the fast modes are subdominant even for supersonic driving @xcite .",
    "therefore we expect to see alignment of magnetic gradient perpendicular to the local magnetic - field direction .",
    "this is the conclusion that we use for the study below .",
    "we may add that for the weakly compressible flows the density associated with slow waves will mimic the gs95 scalings @xcite .",
    "however , for supersonic flows the production of shocks significantly disturbs the statistics of density . as a result , for subsonic flows density gradients",
    "are also expected to be aligned perpendicular to magnetic field which explain the results in empirical results in @xcite as well as our numerical experiments with density gradients in @xcite ( @xcite , henceafter gl16 ) and @xcite ( @xcite , henceforth yl17 ) . in terms of magnetic field tracing the density gradients are expected to be inferior to velocity and magnetic field gradients , but the misalignment of density gradients and magnetic - field directions can be informative in terms of shocked gas and supersonic flows .",
    "synchrotron emission arises from relativistic electrons spiraling about magnetic fields ( see @xcite references therein ) .",
    "careful study of the formation of the synchrotron signal ( see @xcite ) revealed that the signal is essentially non - linear in the magnetic field @xmath20 with the origin of nonlinearity arising from relativistic effects .",
    "for the power law distribution of electrons @xmath21 , the synchrotron emissivity is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the corresponds to the magnetic field component perpendicular to the line of sight , the latter given by the z - axis .",
    "the fractional power of the index @xmath24 was a complication for many statistical studies .",
    "however , the problem of the magnetic field dependence on the fractional power was dealt with in @xcite , where it was shown that the correlation functions and spectra of @xmath25 can be expressed as a product of a known function of @xmath26 times the statistics of @xmath27 . although we do not use the correlation function approach explicitly , our approach is based on the statistical properties turbulence and we expect that similar to the case considered in @xcite the gradients calculated with @xmath28 will correctly represent the results for other @xmath26 .",
    "thus the fractional power of magnetic field in eq .",
    "( [ synch ] ) will not be considered as an issue within the present study of aimed at determining magnetic field gradients .",
    "it is evident from eq .",
    "( [ synch ] ) that gradients of the synchrotron intensity transfer into the integral of magnetic field gradients .",
    "our considerations in  [ sec:2 ] suggest that the latter should be aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field . as the synchrotron polarization",
    "is also directed perpendicular to the magnetic field , we expect that the directions of the gradients and synchrotron polarization should coincide . to test this assumption we use the results of numerical simulations obtained with our 3d mhd compressible code ( see more details in @xcite ) and following the procedures described in @xcite created both the maps of synchrotron polarization and synchrotron intensity .      to calculate synchrotron intensity gradients ( sigs ) , we use the recipe of gradient calculation that we introduced in yl17 .",
    "the recipe is composed of three steps .",
    "we first pre - process our synchrotron intensity maps with an appropriate noise - removal gaussian filter .",
    "we then interpolate the map to ten times its original level , and determine the gradient field by computing the maximum gradient direction in the interpolated synchrotron intensity maps . by probing the peak in gradient orientation distributions in the sub - blocks of the gradient map , we gain an estimate of the _ sub - block averaged _ gradient vector as in yl17 .",
    "that allows us to compare our magnetic field predictions to synthetic polarization vectors .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] demonstrates that the recipe can deliver sigs in a robust way and the magnetic - field directions that are obtained with sigs provide a good representation of magnetic field . to demonstrate the latter point in figure [ fig:1 ] we also show the magnetic field directions as traced by the synchrotron polarization in the synthetic observations .",
    "the latter are also directed perpendicular to the magnetic field and therefore we observe a good alignment of the two types of vectors in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "for most of the environments of the spiral galaxies the areas dominating the synchrotron emission may correspond to the hot gas with low sonic mach numbers @xmath29 .",
    "however , suggesting it is interesting to explore to what extend the effects of compressibility can affect the sig technique .",
    "we also test how the sigs trace magnetic field in systems with different @xmath29.the upper panels of figure [ fig:2 ] show the relative alignment of polarization and sig .",
    "we observe the alignment decreases with the increase of @xmath29 , but the sigs which is also supported by the lower panels of figure [ fig:2 ] where the distribution of the sigs about the polarization direction is shown .",
    "we note that there exist different ways of measuring the turbulence sonic mach number and the studies like those illustrated in figure [ fig:2 ] allow to evaluate the accuracy of magnetic field tracing using the sigs .",
    "the alignment measure of the sigs as a function of the noise level for maps produced for @xmath30 and @xmath31 using block - size of 64 , which corresponds to the middle panels of figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "@xmath32 indicates the width of the gaussian filters , in the unit of pixels , applied in the pre - processing step .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    real observations are associated with the noise in the data .",
    "therefore we test to what extend the alignment persists in a noisy environment .",
    "we calculate the sigs by adding white noises to our synthetic maps and use the alignment measure ( see gl16 ) to quantify how well the sigs are tracing the synchrotron polarization that represents the projected magnetic field : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the angle between the sig direction and that of the polarization .",
    "the noise is introduced into the data in the following way .",
    "we generate white noises such that the noise amplitude is gaussian with mean value zero .",
    "the noise level is defined as the standard deviation of the noise distribution .",
    "the resultant noise is added to the original map .",
    "the noise level is selected to be the multiple of @xmath35 of the mean synchrotron intensity , extended to a maximum equals to the mean synchrotron intensity .",
    "this ensures maps with weak and strong noise level are produced correctly .",
    "we treat the synthetic data as it if it were the real observational data . for this purpose",
    ", we analyze our noisy data using pre - processing gaussian filters @xcite , which is a procedure frequently used as a noise reduction tool in observations . the smoothing effect from the gaussian filter",
    "enables us to compute per - pixel gradient information more accurately .",
    "the strength of the filter is controlled by the width @xmath32 , which characterizes how many pixels are averaged to give the information of one pixel in the filtered map .",
    "a larger @xmath32 will suppress noises and produce a smoother map , while sacrificing the accuracy in small scales . to see the effect of the filter on alignments , we perform a test on several @xmath32 on maps with different noise levels , and measure the @xmath36 of the resultant map .",
    "the results of alignment measures under different noise levels and gaussian filters are shown in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "without the gaussian filter pre - process , the alignment is expected to be strongly contaminated , which we also observed .",
    "applying gaussian filters significantly improves the alignment .",
    "while a small gaussian filter shows that the alignment decreases with the increase of the noise , a filter with larger width saves the alignment even in a strong - noise environment .",
    "this experiment demonstrates that sigs can trace magnetic fields in the presence of noise .",
    "the detailed maps of synchrotron radiation can be obtained with interferometers .",
    "interferometers measure the spatial fourier components of the image and changing the baseline of the interferometer one gets different spatial frequencies . for interferometric observations",
    "the single dish measurements deliver low spatial frequencies .",
    "the single dish observations frequencies are not available .",
    "then it is important to understand how this can affect the accuracy of the sigs .",
    "synchrotron polarization gradients were used in @xcite and one of the motivations for their use was the possibility of using gradients with the interferometric data obtained without single dish observations .",
    "below we test how the accuracy of the sigs of tracing of magnetic field depends on the missing spacial frequencies .    in figure [ fig:4 ]",
    "we show the alignment measure given by eq .",
    "( [ am ] ) using the same data as in figure [ fig:3 ] but gradually removing spatial frequencies starting with the lowest spatial frequencies from the inertial range of our data .",
    "we observe a gradual decrease of the @xmath36 .",
    "when the block size increases , removing more lower spacial frequencies will still preserve the alignment .",
    "our results confirm that the high spacial frequencies are the most important for determining the sigs .",
    "the alignment measure of the sigs as a function of the removed low spacial frequencies from the map with @xmath30 and @xmath31 using block - sizes of 16,32,64,128 , and applied a gaussian pre - filter of 4 .",
    "we by default remove the injection range , which is around @xmath37.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "the encouraging results above stimulated us to use the sig technique with the planck synchrotron data . for our test we picked a part of planck foreground synchrotron intensity map @xcite and compared the magnetic - field directions that we obtained with sigs with the magnetic - field directions as determined by the planck synchrotron polarization data .    to simplify the interpretation we used only the part of the data corresponding to high galactic latitudes , namely the data corresponding to @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "we projected the data to the cartesian frame .",
    "as shown in section [ subsec : gf ] that @xmath40 can already preserve the alignment in strong - noise environment , we follow the procedure and reduced the noise using a @xmath40 gaussian pre - filter .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] shows a part of the sky overplotted with sig and synchrotron polarization , which shows an good alignment in this region . the alignment measure for this region @xmath41 .",
    "sigs ( yellow ) and synchrotron polarization vector ( cyan ) on a piece of planck synchrotron data , overplotted with the synchrotron intensity.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    our test shows that the sigs can be applied to observational data at high latitudes .",
    "this test corresponds to our simulations of low @xmath42 turbulence . for the galactic plane region",
    "the magnetic field is much more complicated and the faraday rotation may be important .",
    "therefore it is more challenging to obtain a polarization map that would represent the true structure of the magnetic field .",
    "naturally , more tests of the sigs in the presence of the complex magnetic - field morphology are needed . therefore moving from our demonstration here to studies of magnetic fields in the galactic disk",
    "requires a more detailed study and will be performed elsewhere .",
    "sigs are not the only way to trace magnetic field with synchrotron intensity maps . for instance",
    ", anisotropic mhd turbulence also results in synchrotron anisotropies that are quantified in lp12 .",
    "there the quadruple moment of the synchrotron intensity correlation functions was shown to be aligned with the magnetic field .",
    "therefore by measuring the longer direction of the contours of the magnetic field isocorrelation ( see lp12 ) one can approximate the magnetic - field direction over the sky .",
    "the calculations of the correlation functions , require averaging , which for the astrophysical situations means the volume averaging .",
    "therefore one may expect that compared to the sigs , the lp12-type anisotropies are a significantly more coarse - graded measure . to test this statement we provide in figure [ fig:6 ] the @xmath36 for the sigs and the similarly - defined alignment measure of the correlation function anisotropies ( cfas ) .",
    "the directions of the cfas longer axes of anisotropy are rotated 90 degrees to be compared with the directions of the sigs and the synchrotron polarization .",
    "we compare sub - block averaged sigs with the cfas obtained in the same blocks .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] clearly shows that the sigs have a great advantage over the cfas on tracing magnetic field in smaller block size . in terms of the alignment measure ,",
    "the cfas can trace magnetic field only in a for a sufficiently coarse block size .",
    "comparatively , the sigs can work on smaller scales without losing much of the alignment .",
    "the ability of cfas for the same purpose is highly limited .         we , however , suggest that sigs and cfas are complementary measures in a number of ways .",
    "the correspondence between coarse - graded magnetic - field directions measured by the two techniques makes the tracing of magnetic field more trustworthy .",
    "their correspondence also indicates that the performed averaging may be sufficient to use the studies of the cfa anisotropies for the purpose of separating the contribution from fundamental mhd modes , i.e. alfven , fast and slow , as it is described in lp12 .",
    "it is always good to have yet another way of studying astrophysical magnetic fields .",
    "however , the advantages of the sigs are not limited by this .",
    "synchrotron polarization is a generally accepted way of studying magnetic fields in our galaxy , external galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "one of the difficulties of using of synchrotron polarization is that the polarized radiation is subject to the faraday rotation effect . to account for this effect ,",
    "multifrequency observations are performed and the faraday rotation is compensated .",
    "this is a significant complication .",
    "in addition , different regions may be responsible for the emission at different frequencies , which may be source of an error .",
    "moreover , recent analytical studies in @xcite have demonstrated that the separation of the effects of the faraday rotation in the presence of turbulent magnetic fields are far from trivial ( see also @xcite ) . in this situation",
    "the possibility of obtaining magnetic field direction using sigs is very advantageous .",
    "combining the sigs and the polarization measurements can be very synergetic . by measuring the actual direction of magnetic field using the sigs and comparing it with the direction of polarization one",
    "can get the measure of the faraday rotation of the media between us and the synchrotron - emitting region .",
    "the sig technique is similar to the velocity centroid gradient ( vcg ) technique that was introduced in gl16 and applied to studies of magnetic fields in atomic hydrogen in yl17 . within the vcg technique the calculation of gradients",
    "is performed using the 2d maps of velocity centroids gradients .",
    "the latter are readily available from the doppler - shifted spectroscopic data .    compared to the vcgs , the calculation of the sigs is simpler , as it requires only synchrotron intensities , rather than full spectroscopic data . in this sense",
    "the sig technique is similar to tracing magnetic fields using intensity gradients ( igs ) @xcite .",
    "the synergy of these techniques will be further explored in future publications .",
    "it is clear that , in general , sigs , vcgs and igs trace magnetic field in different environments .",
    "for instance , cold and warm diffuse hi , line emission , e.g. co emission , from molecular clouds present the natural environments for studies using the vcg technique . combining that with the igs , one can study shocks and self - gravitating regions ( yl17 , yuen & lazarian 2017b ) and measuring the relative alignment of the directions defined by the vcgs and igs one can characterize the sonic mach number of the media . at the same time ,",
    "synchrotron radiation in the mikly way mostly originate at the large expanses of the galactic halo and this is the domain of the sig technique .",
    "for some regions , however , e.g. for the supernovae shocks , it seems very advantageous to apply all three techniques .",
    "we would also like to note that there are several significant advantages of the sigs compared to the igs .",
    "first of all , numerical studies show that in mhd turbulence magnetic and velocity statistics are more robust and predictable measures compared to densities .",
    "this was confirmed for the gradient techniques in gl16 and yl17 .",
    "in addition , it is clear from the discussion in  [ sec:2 ] that the most reliable magnetic - field tracing is expected in nearly incompressible turbulence in the absence of self - gravity .",
    "these are the conditions for the warm and hot phases of the ism ( see @xcite for the list of the idealized ism phases ) .",
    "these are exactly the media that are responsible for the bulk of synchrotron radiation .",
    "in fact , earlier studies ( e.g. @xcite ) indicated that the sonic mach number of the synchrotron emitting warm media is around unity .",
    "it is expected to be much less than unity for the hot coronal gas of the galactic halo .",
    "therefore we expect that the sigs can trace magnetic fields well and be less affected by the distortion that arises from compressibility effects .",
    "compared to the vcgs , the sigs are also more robust , as the vcgs are influenced by the density distribution ( see @xcite ) and the density is not a robust tracer of mhd turbulence statistics . at the same time , the synchrotron intensity fluctuations are produced by uniformly distributed electrons and thus are expected to better reflect the magnetic - field statistics .",
    "in fact , rather than confronting the different techniques , it is more advantageous to search for their synergy .",
    "for instance , the sigs and the vcgs can trace magnetic fields in different phases of the ism , e.g. while vcgs are convenient for studying magnetic fields in cold and warm phases , the sigs can study magnetic fields in warm and hot phases . thus combining the measurements , one can investigate the relative distribution of magnetic fields in different ism phases along the line of sight .",
    "such studies are essential for understanding of the complex dynamics of magnetized multiphase ism .",
    "we can add that the ways of studying vcgs and sigs are similar .",
    "for instance , within our present study we successfully used the way of calculating gradients first suggested in yl17 .",
    "in addition , our present study also shows that sigs similar to vcgs can be obtained using interferometric data with missing low spatial frequencies , e.g. the interferometric data obtained without the corresponding single dish observations .",
    "this opens prospects of using of the two techniques for studying extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "faraday rotation is an important way of studying magnetic field component parallel to the line - of - sight ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one can define the rotation measure ( rm ) , which is proportional to the integral of the product of the parallel to the line - of - sight component of magnetic field and thermal electron density , if the original magnetic - field direction at the source is known .",
    "the sigs can be used to define this direction , which has advantages over the currently - used faraday - rotation measurements that employ multifrequency polarization measurements . moreover",
    ", sigs can help to distinguish the faraday rotation that arises from the source of polarized radiation and the media intervening between the source and the observer .",
    "indeed , at the source the sigs are measuring the actual magnetic - field direction .",
    "the alignment of interstellar dust is a well - accepted way of tracing magnetic field . both theoretical considerations and the observational testing ( see and ref .",
    "therein ) indicate that the alignment of dust is very efficient in the diffuse media where radiative torques are strong .",
    "the alignment can trace magnetic fields in the self - gravitating regions , but it may fail in starless molecular cloud cores .",
    "the polarization arising from grain alignment is complementary to the vcgs as it is discussed in yl17 .",
    "combining sigs , vcgs and polarimetry one can study how magnetic fields connect hot , warm and cold ism phases with molecular clouds .    a promising possibility is presented with tracing of magnetic field using aligned atoms or ions ( @xcite and ref . therein ) .",
    "this alignment happens for atoms / ions with fine or hyperfine structure and is induced by radiation .",
    "the larmor precession realigns atoms / ions and thus the resulting polarization becomes dependent on the magnetic field direction .",
    "this type of alignment can potentially trace extremely weak fields in the diffuse rarefied media and we expect that this can be complementary to the sig technique .",
    "using the theory of mhd turbulence we predicted that in magnetized flows the synchrotron intensity gradients ( sigs ) are expected to be aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "we successfully tested this prediction using synthetic synchrotron maps obtained with the 3d mhd compressible simulations as well as planck synchrotron intensity and polarization data .",
    "the new technique is complementary to the other ways of tracing magnetic field , which include traditional techniques using synchrotron and dust polarization as well new techniques that employ velocity centroid gradients ( vcgs ) and atomic / ionic alignment .",
    "the sigs are giving the true direction of the magnetic field in the synchrotron - emitting volume that is not distorted by the faraday rotation effect .",
    "therefore , combining the sigs with synchrotron polarimetry measurements one can determine the faraday rotation measure .",
    "this is useful for studying line - of - sight component of magnetic field .",
    "we have demonstrated that the sigs are a robust measure in the presence of gaussian noise .",

    "<S> on the basis of the modern understanding of mhd turbulence , we propose a new way of using synchrotron radiation , namely using synchrotron intensity gradients for tracing astrophysical magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we successfully test the new technique using synthetic data obtained with the 3d mhd simulations and provide the demonstration of the use of the technique with the planck intensity and polarization data . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the synchrotron intensity gradients ( sigs ) can reliably trace magnetic field in the presence of shocks and noise and can provide more detailed maps of magnetic - field directions compared to the technique employing anisotropy of synchrotron intensity correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the sigs are relatively robust for tracing magnetic fields while the low spacial frequencies of the synchrotron image are removed . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the sigs applicable to tracing of magnetic fields using interferometric data with single dish measurement absent . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the synergy of using the sigs together with synchrotron polarization in order to find the actual direction of the magnetic field and quantify the effects of faraday rotation as well as with other ways of studying astrophysical magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> we stress the complementary nature of the studies using the sig technique and those employing the recently - introduced velocity centroid gradient technique that traces the magnetic fields using spectroscopic data . </S>"
