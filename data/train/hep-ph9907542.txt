    "the discovery of a higgs boson @xcite is one of the major goals of the present searches in particle physics .",
    "the higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) is until now undiscovered but direct or indirect results give stringent lower bounds on its mass .",
    "moreover , the problematic scalar sector of the sm can be enlarged and some simple extensions of the sm with several higgs bosons have been intensively studied for many years .",
    "the simplest extension is the two higgs doublet model ( thdm ) @xcite , the two most commonly studied versions being classified as type i and ii .",
    "they differ in how the higgs bosons are coupled to the fermions , although both versions possess identical particle spectra after electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite . from the 8 degrees of freedom",
    "initially present in the 2 higgs doublets , 3 correspond to masses of the longitudinal gauge bosons , leaving 5 degrees of freedom which should be manifested as 5 physical higgs particles ( 2 charged higgs @xmath6 , 2 cp  even @xmath7 , @xmath8 and one cp  odd @xmath0 ) .",
    "model type ii is the structure found in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "until now no higgs boson has been discovered , and from the null searches one can derive direct and indirect bounds on their masses .",
    "the latest such limits are @xmath9 gev @xcite and @xmath10 gev @xcite gev @xmath11 gev . ] .",
    "we note that in the general thdm which will be considered in this paper the existence of a very light @xmath8 or @xmath0 is not excluded by the current searches ( @xcite and refs therein ) .",
    "higgs boson production in association with gauge bosons has been extensively studied in the literature :    * higgsstrahlung ( @xmath12 ) both for the sm higgs boson @xcite or for higgs bosons originating from extended higgs sectors @xcite ( thdm and mssm ) . *",

    "we consider the rare decay @xmath19 in the context of the thdm .",
    "such a process is forbidden at tree  level and proceeds via loops , with the rate at hadron colliders evaluated in ref .",
    "calculations of the loop mediated decay @xmath20 have appeared in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , but not for the full process @xmath19 . although not expected to give a rate comparable to the mechanisms above , if observable this decay would be a test of the thdm at the one  loop level , since this mechanism would be sensitive to new physics entering in the loop .",
    "in addition it is important to have an accurate prediction for @xmath21 in order to distinguish between possible signals from a cp  violating and cp  conserving thdm . in a cp  violating thdm tree ",
    "level mixing is allowed between the pure cp  even states and pure cp ",

    "such scalar  pseudoscalar mixing may also arise in the mssm , being generated radiatively if one allows cp  violating phases in the model @xcite . the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",

    "the quarks and leptons couple only to the second higgs doublet @xmath53 , while in the latter , in order to avoid the problem of flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xcite , one assumes that @xmath54 couples only to down quarks ( and charged leptons ) and @xmath53 couples only to up quarks ( and neutral leptons ) .",

    "the effects of down quarks and tau  lepton are enhanced ( suppressed ) in model type ii ( model type i ) .      in a general two higgs doublet model ,",
    "the interactions between higgs bosons and gauge bosons are completely dictated by the local gauge invariances and so they are model independent regardless of whether the model is supersymmetric or not .",
    "these interactions originate from the square of the covariant derivative in the higgs lagrangian which is given by : @xmath62^+(\\partial_\\mu + ig \\vec{t_a } \\vec{w_{\\mu}^a } + ig'\\frac{y_{\\phi_i}}{2}b_\\mu ) \\phi_i \\label{covder}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where : @xmath63 is the isospin operator , @xmath64 the hypercharge of the higgs fields , @xmath65 the @xmath66 gauge fields , @xmath67 the @xmath68 gauge field , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the associated coupling constants . + after expanding eq .",

    "level while the vertex @xmath71@xmath71@xmath0 vanishes by virtue of cp  invariance @xcite .",
    "+ therefore , at tree  level , the contributions to @xmath72 and/or @xmath73 only come from the @xmath74channel via electron exchange and from the following @xmath75channels : @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the two cp  even neutral higgs fields .",
    "all these contributions are proportional to the electron mass @xmath30 which we will neglect in our work . as a major consequence , in this limit",
    ", the studied process will be only due to loop effects .",
    "+   + from eq.([covder ] ) one can deduce the following vertices which are needed for our study : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the cosine and sine of the weinberg angle @xmath81 .",
    "we need also : @xmath82 where @xmath83 may refer to @xmath56 or @xmath57 , and @xmath84      in a thdm , cp  violation ( explicit or spontaneous ) is possible in the higgs sector if one allows the discrete symmetry to be broken softly by a term of dimension 2 ( @xmath85 ) . in such a case mixing",
    "is permitted between the pure cp  even states @xmath8 , @xmath7 and the pure cp ",
    "odd state @xmath0 , leading to three neutral higgs mass eigenstates which can not be assigned a definite cp quantum number .",
    "in the notation of ref.@xcite these are referred to as @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , whose couplings obey various sum rules @xcite,@xcite which in the cp  conserving case reduce to the familiar sum rules of the thdm / mssm e.g. one has ( where the couplings are normalized to sm higgs boson strength ) @xmath89 here @xmath90 run from 1 to 3 , @xmath91 is the coupling @xmath24 , and @xmath92 is the coupling @xmath93 .",
    "@xcite explained how cp  violation may be probed in the higgs sector by measuring non  zero values for each of @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , or for each of @xmath93 , @xmath24,@xmath97 ( where @xmath98 ) .",
    "a third way would be a positive signal in all three higgsstrahlung channels @xmath99 , and it is possible that the higgs masses are arranged such that the latter production mechanisms would be all open kinematically ( i.e. @xmath100 ) while pair production of higgs bosons are not .",
    "therefore the cp  violating thdm may provide measurable signals in the @xmath101 channel for all three neutral higgs bosons . hence in order to distinguish between a cp  violating thdm and a cp  conserving thdm in the above channels it is important to know the attainable value of @xmath21 in the cp  conserving case .    in refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite , using effective lagrangians , it was shown that a cp ",
    "odd higgs scalar with effective point like couplings @xmath102 and @xmath103 would give rise to angular distributions in the channel @xmath19 which would differ significantly from those in @xmath104 .",
    "our analysis essentially determines the possible magnitude of these effective couplings @xmath102 and @xmath103 in the context of the thdm . in the notation of @xcite this would correspond to evaluating the arbitrary couplings @xmath105 . given the expected smallness of the rate for @xmath106 , any angular distribution analysis for this channel would most likely be hampered by small statistics .",
    "if in the cp  violating thdm all three @xmath24 couplings have a reasonable strength ( i.e. significant pseudoscalar  scalar mixing ) , a detectable signal would be possible which could not be mimicked by the cp  conserving thdm .",
    "in addition there would be sufficient events to show that the angular distribution proceeded via the cp  even scalar component .",
    "the problematic case of interest to us is when a @xmath22 is dominantly pseudoscalar and thus has a smaller ( but still detectable ) rate in the @xmath107 channel . in this case",
    "the signal from @xmath108 is background to any possible interpretation of a cp  violating signal in this channel .",
    "it is also this scenario when angular distributions would be affected by low statistics .",
    "we have evaluated the pure radiative effects of the rare decay @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) at the one  loop level in the t hooft - feynman gauge .",
    "the sum of all the one  loop effects are ultra ",
    "violet ( uv ) convergent but since some feynman diagrams are uv divergent we will use the dimensional regularization scheme @xcite to deal with them .",
    "the typical feynman diagrams for the virtual corrections of order @xmath111 are drawn in figure 1 . in the thdm ,",
    "the @xmath112 and the @xmath113 vertices receive corrections only from fermion exchanges ( fig.1-a - b ) .",
    "there are also box diagrams and their crossed analogies ( fig.1-c ) .",
    "note that there is no mixing coming from the @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) s  channel self  energy because the vertices @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) and @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) vanish , while the mixing @xmath114 has to be considered in the t  channel ( fig.1.d ) .",
    "owing to lorentz invariance the @xmath114 self energy is proportional to @xmath120 ; then , since the vector boson v=@xmath51 or z is on  shell , the t  channel amplitude will be proportional to @xmath30 and consequently vanishes .",
