    "the idea of extra dimensions is by now a well - known one .",
    "it has led to new solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem without imposing supersymmetry  @xcite , and it has opened up new avenues to attack the flavour puzzle in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one such application is the seminal proposal of split fermions by arkani - hamed and schmaltz  @xcite that fermion mass hierarchy can be generated from the wave function overlap of fermions located differently in the extra dimension .",
    "the split fermion scenario had been implemented in both flat extra dimension models  @xcite , and warped extra dimension randall - sundrum ( rs ) models  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , phenomenologically successful mass matrices were found in the case of one flat extra dimension without much fine tuning of the yukawa couplings  @xcite , and in the case of warped extra dimensions , realistic fermion masses and mixing pattern can be reproduced with almost universal bulk yukawa couplings  @xcite .    to date , many attempts in understanding the fermion flavour structure come in terms of symmetries .",
    "fermion mass matrix ansatz with a high degree of symmetry were constructed to fit simultaneously the observed mass hierarchy and flavour mixing patterns .",
    "it is an interesting question whether in the pure geometrical setting of the rs framework where there are no flavour symmetries a priori , such symmetrical forms can arise and arise naturally without fine tuning of the yukawa couplings , i.e. whether symmetries in the fermion mass matrices can be compatible with a natural , hierarchyless yukawa structure in the rs framework , and to what degree .",
    "another interesting and related question is whether or not one can experimentally discern if the fermion mass matrices are symmetric in the rs framework . in the sm , only the left - handed ( lh ) fermion mixings such as the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing matrix is measurable , but not the right - handed ( rh ) ones .",
    "however , in the rs framework the rh fermion mixings become measurable through the effective couplings of the gauge bosons to the fermions induced from the kaluza - klein ( kk ) interactions . if the fermion mass matrices",
    "are symmetric , the lh and rh mixing matrices would be the same .",
    "thus the most direct way of searching for the effects of these rh mixings would be through the induced rh fermion couplings in flavour changing processes that are either not present or very much suppressed in the sm .    in this work we study how well the rs setting serves as a framework for flavour physics either with or without symmetries in the fermion mass matrices , and if the two scenarios can be distinguished experimentally .",
    "we concentrate on the quark ( and especially the top ) sector , and we study the issues involved in the rs1 model  @xcite with an @xmath4 bulk symmetry , which we shall refer to as the minimal custodial rs ( mcrs ) model . the @xmath5 is customarily identified with @xmath6 .",
    "the enlarged electroweak symmetry contains a custodial isospin symmetry which protects the sm @xmath7 parameter from receiving excessive corrections , and the model has been shown to be a complete one that can pass all electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) at a scale of @xmath8 to 4  tev  @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rsfp ] we quickly review the details of the mcrs model to fix our notations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rsmq ] we investigate which type of mass matrix ansatz is compatible with yukawa couplings that are perturbative and not fine - tuned by matching the ansatz form to that in the mcrs model .",
    "relevant matching formulae and ewpt limits on the controlling parameters are collected into the two appendices .",
    "we also investigate possible patterns in the mass matrices by numerically scanning the ewpt allowed parameter space for those that can reproduce simultaneously the observed quark masses and the ckm mixing matrix . in sec .",

    "in this section , we briefly review the set - up of the mcrs model .",
    "we summarize relevant results on the kk reduction and the interactions of the bulk gauge fields and fermions , and establish the notation to be used below .",
    "the mcrs model is formulated in a 5-dimensional ( 5d ) background geometry based on a slice of @xmath10 space of size @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the radius of the compactified fifth dimension .",
    "two 3-branes are located at the boundaries of the @xmath10 slice , which are also the orbifold fixed points .",
    "they are taken to be @xmath13 ( uv ) and @xmath14 ( ir ) respectively .",
    "the metric is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the @xmath10 curvature , and @xmath18 .",
    "the model has @xmath19 as its bulk gauge symmetry group .",
    "the fermions reside in the bulk , while the sm higgs , which is now a bidoublet , is localized on the ir brane to avoid fine tuning .",

    "the gauge field lagrangian is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 are field strength tensors of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "on the ir brane , @xmath31 is spontaneously broken down to @xmath32 when the sm higgs acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) . on the uv brane ,",
    "first the custodial @xmath29 is broken down to @xmath33 by orbifold boundary conditions ; this involves assigning orbifold parities under @xmath34 to the @xmath35-components of the gauge fields : one assigns @xmath36 for @xmath37 , and @xmath38 for all other gauge fields , where the first ( second ) entry refers to the parity on the uv ( ir ) boundary .",
    "then , @xmath39 is further broken down to @xmath40 spontaneously ( via a vev ) , leaving just @xmath41 as the unbroken symmetry group .",

    "one of the chiralities is projected out .",
    "it can be seen that the lh zero mode is localized towards the the uv ( ir ) brane if @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , while the rh zero mode is localized towards the the uv ( ir ) brane when @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) .",

    "the spectrum of fermion kk masses is found from the coefficient function relations given by eqs .   and  .",
    "now there is an additional @xmath29 gauge symmetry over the sm in the bulk , and the fermions have to be embedded into its representations .",
    "below we chose the simplest way of doing this , viz .",
    "the lh fermions are embedded as @xmath29 singlets , while the rh fermions are doublets  @xcite .",
    "note that since the @xmath29 is broken on the uv brane by the orbifold boundary condition , one component of the doublet under it must be even under the @xmath61 parity , and the other odd .",
    "this forces a doubling of rh doublets where the upper component , say the up - type quark , of one doublet , and the lower component of the other doublet , the down - type , are even .      in 5d , the interaction between fermions and a bulk gauge boson is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the 5d gauge coupling constant .",

    "q_th gauge kk mode is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the 4d sm gauge coupling constant .",
    "note that since the gauge zero - mode has a flat profile ( eq .  ) , by the orthonormality condition of the fermions wave functions , eq .  , only fermions of the same kk level couple to the gauge zero - mode , and the 4d coupling",
    "is simply given by @xmath86 .",
    "with the higgs field @xmath87 localized on the ir brane , the yukawa interactions are contained entirely in @xmath23 of the 5d action  .",
    "the relevant action on the ir brane is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 are the dimensionless 5d yukawa coupling , and @xmath90 the family indices .",
    "rescaling the higgs field to @xmath91 so that it is canonically normalized , the effective 4d yukawa interaction obtained after spontaneous symmetry breaking is given by @xmath92 where @xmath93  gev is the vev acquired by the higgs field .",
    "the zero modes give rise to the sm mass terms , and the resulting mass matrix reads @xmath94 where the label @xmath95 denotes up - type or down - type quark species .",
    "note that the yukawa couplings are in general complex , and so take the form @xmath96 , with @xmath97 the magnitude and the phase respectively .",
    "in this section , we investigate the possible quark flavour structure in the rs framework .",
    "one immediate requirement on the candidate structures is that the experimentally observed quark mass spectrum and mixing pattern are reproduced .",
    "another would be that the 5d yukawa couplings are all of the same order , in accordance with the philosophy of the rs framework that there is no intrinsic hierarchy .",
    "we also required that constraints from ewpt are satisfied .",
    "to arrive at the candidate structures , we follow two strategies .",
    "one is to start with a known sm quark mass matrix ansatz which reproduces the observed quark mass spectrum and mixing pattern .",
    "the ansatz form is then matched onto the rs mass matrix to see if the above requirements are satisfied .",
    "the other strategy is to generate rs mass matrices at random and then pick out those that satisfy the requirements above .",
    "tev where there is a little hierarchy . ]    to solve the hierarchy problem , we take @xmath98 and the warped down scale to be @xmath99  tev . since new physics first arise at the tev scale in the rs framework , it is also where experimental data are matched to the rs model below .",
    "we will assume that the ckm matrix evolves slowly between @xmath100 and @xmath101  tev so that the pdg values can be adopted , and we will use the running quark mass central values at @xmath101  tev from ref .  @xcite .      in trying to understand the pattern of quark flavour mixing , many ansatz for the sm quark mass matrices have been proposed over the years .",
    "there are two common types of mass matrix ansatz consistent with the current ckm data .",
    "one type is the hermitian ansatz first proposed by fritzsch some time ago  @xcite , which has been recently updated to better accommodate @xmath102  @xcite .",

    "the matrix @xmath124 depends on four free parameters , @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",

    "fig : brsymm](b ) and table  [ tb : asbrtc ] that in @xmath266 decays , the lh decays dominate over the rh ones in the case of both symmetrical and asymmetrical quark mass matrices .",
    "the reason for this is however different for the two cases . in the symmetric case , @xmath269 and",
    "so @xmath270 .",
    "thus the difference between the lh and rh decays is due to the differences in the weak eigenbasis couplings , as can be seen from eq .  , and @xmath246 .",
    "by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : hkftuc](b ) to  [ fig : hkgtuc](b ) we see @xmath271 , and from fig .",
    "[ fig : hkgtuc](b ) we have @xmath272   can be smaller than @xmath273 ( for @xmath274 ) , as one may expect that the couplings to be dominated by the top contribution , and the coupling to the rh top to be larger than that to the lh top due to the fact that the rh top is localized closer to the ir brane .",
    "however , such expectations can be misleading .",
    "because of the mixing matrices , the mass eigenbasis coupling , @xmath275 , is not just a simple sum of the weak eigenbasis couplings , @xmath233 , but involves their differences as already mentioned .",
    "moreover , although the greatest contribution comes from the top , the contribution from the second generation may not be completely negligible , as is the case here for @xmath276 for the particular symmetric ansatz that we study . ]",
    "however , as @xmath277 , the net effect is that the lh decay dominates ( see eq .  ) .    in the asymmetrical case , @xmath278 and @xmath279 with no pattern relating the lh to the rh mixings . in each of the configurations of localization parameters listed in table  [ tb : asbrtc ] , while @xmath280 , it turns out that not only @xmath281 and @xmath282 , there is also a relative minus sign between the gauge and the fermion kk contributions , which results in a destructive interference that leads to a greater branching ratio for the lh decay .",
    "this is to be contrasted with ref .",
    "@xcite where it is the rh mode that is found to dominate . there",
    "it appears that the possibility of having a cancellation between the gauge and fermion kk contributions was not considered .",
    "we note and emphasize here the crucial role the quark mass and mixing matrices play in determining the mass eigenbasis flavour off - diagonal couplings @xmath251 .",
    "most importantly , @xmath251 do not depend on the fermion localizations alone .",
    "whether or not there is a cancellation between the gauge and fermion kk contributions depends very much on the combination of the particular quark mass and mixing matrices considered just as well as the configuration of fermion localizations used .",
    "such cancellation is by no mean generic , and has to be checked whenever a new combination of admissible configuration of fermion localizations , and quark mass and mixing matrices arise . in addition , since 5d gauge and yukawa couplings are independent parameters , whether or not @xmath283 does not mean the same has to hold between @xmath284 and @xmath285 .",
    "since @xmath286 and @xmath287 have very different structures ( see eqs .   and  ) , the combined effect when convolved with the particular quark mixing matrices can be quite different , as is the case for the three asymmetrical configurations listed in table  [ tb : asbrtc ] .",
    "it is expected that both the single top and the @xmath288 pair production rates will be high at the lhc , with the latter about a factor of two higher still than the former . to a small correction ,",
    "the single tops are always produced in the lh helicity , while both helicities are produced in pair productions .",
    "thus a simple way of testing the above at the lhc is to compare the decay rates of @xmath1 + jets in single top production events ( e.g. in the associated @xmath289 productions ) to that from the pair productions , so that informations of both lh and rh decays can be extracted .",
    "note that both the single and pair production channels should give comparable branching ratios initially at the discovery stage .",
    "of course , a higher branching ratio would be obtained from pair productions after several years of measurements .",
    "we have performed a detailed study of the admissible forms of quark mass matrices in the mcrs model which reproduce the experimentally well - determined quark mass hierarchy and ckm mixing matrix , assuming a perturbative and hierarchyless yukawa structure that is not fine - tuned .",
    "we arrived at the admissible forms in two different ways . in one we examined several quark mass matrix ansatz which are constructed to fit the quark masses and the ckm matrix .",
    "these ansatz have a high degree of symmetries built in which allows the localization of the quarks ( that give rise to the mass hierarchy in the rs setting ) to be analytically determined .",
    "we found that the koide - type symmetrical ansatz is compatible with the assumption of a hierarchyless yukawa structure in the mcrs model , but not the fritzsch - type hermitian ansatz . because the ansatzed mass matrices are symmetrical , both lh and rh quark mixing matrices are the same .    in the other way , no _ a priori _ quark mass structures were assumed .",
    "a numerical multiparameter search for configurations of quark localization parameters and yukawa couplings that give admissible quark mass matrices was performed .",
    "admissible configurations were found after an extensive search .",
    "no discernible symmetries or pattern were found in the quark mass matrices for both the up - type and down - type quarks .",
    "the lh and rh mixing matrices are found to be different as is expected given the asymmetrical form of the mass matrices .",
    "we studied the possibility of differentiating between the case of symmetrical and asymmetrical quark mass matrices from flavour changing top decays , @xmath1 + jets .",
    "we found the dominant mode of decay is that with a final state charm jet .",
    "the total branching ratio is calculated to be @xmath8 to @xmath290 in the symmetrical case and @xmath291 to @xmath292 in the asymmetrical case .",
    "the signal is within reach of the lhc which has been estimated to be @xmath293 for a @xmath294 signal at @xmath295  @xcite .",
