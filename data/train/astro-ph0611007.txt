    "the most plausible picture for the observed universe seems to be represented by a nearly flat scenario dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) and a relativistic component endowed with large negative pressure , usually named dark energy @xcite .",
    "although having different status from a theoretical and observational viewpoints , the actual nature of these dominant components remains unknown until the present .",
    "therefore , in certain sense , one may say that the modern general relativistic cosmology is plagued with the so - called cosmological  dark sector problem \" .",
    "recently , many cosmological models driven by dark matter and dark energy have been proposed in the literature aiming to explain the late time cosmic acceleration and other complementary observational results@xcite . among these scenarios ,",
    "a very interesting one was suggested by kamenshchik et al . @xcite and further developed by bili et al .",
    "@xcite and bento et al .",
    "it corresponds to a class of world models dominated by an exotic fluid , named chaplygin gas ( c - gas ) , which can be macroscopically characterized by the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 = 1 and @xmath7 is a positive constant related to the present - day chaplygin adiabatic sound speed , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 stands for the current c - gas density ) .",
    "the above equation for @xmath10 constitutes a generalization of the original c - gas eos proposed by bento et al . in ref .",
    "one of its fundamental features comes from the fact that the c - gas becomes pressureless at high redshifts , which suggests a possible unification scheme for the cosmological  dark sector \" ( cdm plus dark energy ) .",
    "scenarios driven by a c - gas ( without an extra cdm component ) are usually termed quartessence models and have been largely explored in the literature @xcite .    in most of these quartessence analyses ,",
    "besides the present value of the c - gas density parameter ( @xmath11 ) , the above barotropic eos implies that one needs to constrain two additional free parameters , namely , @xmath7 and @xmath6 since the baryonic density ( @xmath12 ) may be fixed a priori by using , for instance , nucleosynthesis or the recent cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the context of a general friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmologies quartessence scenarios require at least 3 parameters to be constrained by the data ( see for instance , bertolami et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in other words",
    ", there are so many parameters to be constrained by the data , that a high degree of degeneracy on the parametric space becomes inevitable .",
    "the common solution in the literature to reduce the number of free parameters ( motivated by current cmb results ) is to assume a flat geometry , i.e. , @xmath13 , where @xmath12 and @xmath14 stand , respectively , for the baryons and c - gas density parameters .    in the last few years",
    ", some generalizations of the original c - gas @xcite , or even of its extended version @xcite have appeared in literature . in these cases ,",
    "the number of free parameters is usually increased , and , as consequence , the models become mathematically richer although much less predictive from a physical viewpoint .    in a recent paper ( from now on paper",
    "i ) we took the opposite way , that is , we have proposed a large set of cosmologies driven by dark energy plus a cdm component where the dark energy component was represented by a simplified version of the chaplygin gas whose equation of state is described by just one free parameter@xcite . by adding the flatness condition the resulting cosmology depends only of two free dimensionless quantities , namely : the density parameter , @xmath15 , and the equation of state parameter , @xmath6 .    in this work we explore the results of paper i now for a quartessence version thereby reducing still more the parameter space . in this way",
    ", we discuss what we believe to be the simplest quartessence scenario , that is , the one with the smallest number of free parameters . as we shall see , by an additional physical condition , the allowed range of the @xmath6 free parameter is also restricted a priori , which makes not only the relevant parametric space bidimensional - even for nonflat spatial sections - but also ( and more important ) the model can be more easily discarded or confirmed by the present set of observations since the range of its free parameter is physically limited from causality considerations .",
    "we test the viability of this simplified quartessence approach by discussing the constraints imposed from current sne ia observations , compilation obtained by supernovae cosmology project ( scp ) group , and large scale structure ( lss ) data . as we shall see the model passes the background tests discussed here and its reduced @xmath16 test is slightly smaller than the one of the @xmath17 model .",
    "let us now consider that the geometrical properties of the observed universe are described by the general frw line element @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the scale factor , @xmath20 is the area element on the unit 2-sphere , @xmath21 is the curvature parameter and we have adopted the metric signature convention ( @xmath22,@xmath23,@xmath23,@xmath23 ) . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt units such that @xmath24 .",
    "the matter content of the universe is assumed to be composed of a baryonic component plus the quartessence c - gas fluid .    since each component",
    "is separately conserved , one may integrate out the energy conservation for the c - gas , @xmath25 , to obtain the following expression for its energy density @xcite @xmath26^{\\frac{1}{1 + \\alpha}},\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is a convenient dimensionless constant ( as usual , the subscript  0 \" denotes present - day quantities ) . in the background defined by ( 2 ) , the friedmann equation for a conserved c - gas plus",
    "the baryonic component reads @xmath28^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 is the hubble parameter ) , the function @xmath31 is given by @xmath32^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha + 1}}$ ] and @xmath33 is the fractional contribution of the spatial curvature to @xmath34 .",
    "note that , besides the hubble parameter @xmath35 , we still have 3 additional parameters in this case ( @xmath36 ) , since the baryonic contribution is defined to be @xmath37 from current cmb experiments @xcite .",
    "this is the standard treatment .",
    "therefore , the important aspect to be discussed at this point is how to reduce the quartessence c - gas parameters based on reasonable physical requirements ?    in order to answer the above question , we follow the arguments of ref . @xcite . note that the c - gas adiabatic sound speed reads @xmath38 which must be positive definite for a well - behaved gas ( zero in the limit case of dust ) .",
    "note also that the present - day c - gas adiabatic sound speed is @xmath39 , or still @xmath40 therefore , from the above equation one clearly see that if the parameter @xmath41 is a function of the index @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath42 , the number of free parameters is naturally reduced , and , as an extra bonus , the positiviness of @xmath43 at any time , as well as its thermodynamic stability , is naturally guaranteed . clearly , among many possibilities the simplest choice is @xmath44 , which we assume in this paper . in this case , @xmath45 , or more generally , @xmath46 .",
    "note also that , since the light speed is a natural cutoff for the sound propagation , it follows that @xmath47 , thereby restricting @xmath6 to the interval [ -1,1 ] .",
    "an additional constraint can still be imposed to this parameter .",
    "in fact , with @xmath44 , the simplified c - gas eos ( 1 ) becomes @xmath48 so that a negative pressure is obtained only for positive values of @xmath6 .",
    "in other words , this accounts to saying that the combined requirements from causality along with the observed accelerating stage of the universe naturally restrict the parameter @xmath6 to the interval @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "0.1 in    note that the simplified quartessence component preserves the unifying character of the original c - gas , i.e. , it behaves as a pressureless fluid ( non - relativistic matter ) at high-@xmath50 while , at late times , it approaches the quintessence behavior , which now is fully characterized by the @xmath6 parameter .",
    "however , note also that , even in this limiting case , the sound speed is positive .    in this simplified approach , eq.([eq4 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath51^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath52 is simply given by @xmath53^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha + 1}}$ ] , so that the only remaining parameters to be determined in this unified dark matter / energy scenario are @xmath6 and @xmath14 . in what follows",
    ", we confront this simplified quartessence scenario with some the most recent sne ia and large scale structure ( lss ) data .",
    "let us first investigate the bounds arising from sne ia observations on the sc - gas scenario described above . to this end",
    "we use the most recent sne ia observations , namely , the union compilation @xcite .",
    "it includes 13 independent sets with sne from the scp , high - z supernovae search ( hzsns ) team , supernova legacy survey and essence survey , the older datasets , as well as the recently extended dataset of distant supernovae observed with hst .",
    "after selection cuts , the robust compilation obtained is composed by 307 sne ia events distributed over the redshift interval @xmath54 .",
    "figure 1 shows residual magnitude versus redshift for 307 sne type ia from scp union compilation .",
    "the union sample is illustrated on a residual hubble diagram with respect to the empty universe model ( @xmath55 ) .",

    "it displays the results for the union scp compilation .",
    "note that although degenerate in @xmath77 , the parameter @xmath6 is now considerably more restricted than in the standard c - gas approach ( see , e.g. , fig .",

    "figure ( 2c ) shows the results of our joint analyses for the bao + union sample .",
    "note that the available parametric plane in both cases are considerably reduced relative to the former analyses ( figs . 2a , 2b and 2c ) .",
    "for the bao + union sample we find @xmath1 and @xmath2 at 95.4% ( c.l . ) with @xmath97 .",
    "this best - fit scenario corresponds to a closed accelerating universe with @xmath98 , a total age of the universe of @xmath99 gyr , and a d / a transition redshift ( from deceleration to acceleration ) @xmath100 .    at this point , it is interesting to compare the above constraints with some independent analyses . in the context of the @xmath4cdm model , for instance , the wmap 5y constrains the curvature parameter to be @xmath101 ( @xmath102% ) @xcite in nice agreement with our result . in the same vein , the age of the universe falls on the interval 13.5 - 14.0 gyr , or equivalently , @xmath103 gyr which is also comparable with the above values .",
    "in addition , recent kinematic studies ( with no gravity theory ) using sne type ia also leads to the constraints @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) @xcite . finally , it is also worth noticing that many alternative scenarios unifying dark matter and dark energy and even accelerating cosmologies with no dark energy have been proposed in the literature @xcite",
    ". usually , such models are able to explain not only the present accelerating expansion , but also the majority of the so - called background tests ( see the paper by ellis et al .",
    "@xcite for a general analysis involving different scenarios ) .",
    "a considerable amount of observational evidence suggests that the current evolution of our universe is fully dominated by two dark components , the so - called dark matter and dark energy . the nature of these components , however , is a tantalizing mystery at present , and it is not even known if they constitute two separate substances . in this paper , we have argued that one of the candidates for a unifying dark matter / dark energy scenario , a c - gas quartessence whose eos is given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , may have a very simplified description .",
    "we have postulated that if @xmath41 is a function of the index @xmath6 the resulting frw cosmology ( with arbitrary curvature ) can be completely described only by a pair of parameters ( @xmath6 , @xmath77 ) . for the sake of simplicity , we have considered @xmath107 with @xmath108 .    by considering this class of parameterization",
    "we have investigated the constraints from current sne ia and lss data .",
    "we have shown that , differently from the original c - gas models ( in which the value of the index @xmath6 is completely degenerated ) a joint analysis involving these data sets restricts considerably the @xmath109 parametric space [ fig .",
    "( 2c ) ] with @xmath1 and @xmath2 . at the level of sne ia data and bao",
    ", we may conclude that this class of quartessence scenario passes this combination of tests , thereby providing an interesting possibility to a dark matter / dark energy unification .",
    "it is worth noticing that the best - fit for this simplified quartessence scenario corresponds to a spatially closed universe and , with the same number of parameters , the @xmath110 is slightly smaller than the one of the flat concordance model ( @xmath4cdm ) . still more important ,",
