    "to summarize , we have presented a hydrodynamical model study for @xmath0 collisions at lhc ( @xmath36 = 14 tev ) energy .",
    "the initial energy density for the hydrodynamic calculation is obtained by requiring a condition that the extrapolated rapidity density of charged particles should be reproduced in the model . after studying the basic properties of particle production ( e.g. , spectra , dn / dy , @xmath81 , and their centrality dependence ) , we have extracted @xmath1 and its dependence on @xmath13 and centralities . as the initial spatial eccentricity depends strongly on the shape of partonic density inside the proton , we have studied two cases of surface diffuseness parameters @xmath4 in woods - saxon profile .",

    "the energy density and particle multiplicity are expected to be substantially large , which suggests the creation of a system that shows collective properties .",
    "first results from the lhc  @xcite have already shown charged multiplicity at the midrapidity region going up to 60 .",
    "therefore , we suggest to measure @xmath1 and its centrality dependence in @xmath0 collisions at the lhc . the centrality dependence can be studied by selecting events with different multiplicity bins .",
    "the estimation of @xmath1 at lhc energy might be affected by the presence of nonflow effects ( e.g. jets ) , but methods based on a scalar product , a cumulant or a standard event plane with a large @xmath28-gap can be applied .",
