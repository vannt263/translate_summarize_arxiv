    "in the lsz formalism , the asymptotic states are taken as free states and the s ",
    "matrix elements are the residues of the poles that arise in the fourier transform of the correlation functions when four - momenta of the external particles are put on - shell .",
    "therefore , the initial and final states used to calculate the transition matrix elements are taken to be the fock states . however , in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) the asymptotic states are not free states and the fermion is accompanied by soft photons i.e. photons with very low momentum . in an actual experiment , due to the finite size of the detector , the charged particle can be accompanied by any number of such photons , which are source of infrared ( ir ) divergences . in the soft photon limit ,",
    "the virtual and real emission are indistinguishable .",
    "so when we are dealing with a virtual photon correction in a process , we need to take into account emission of an infinite number of real soft photons also .",
    "hence , the physical state should be defined as a set of states with an infinite number of soft photons .",
    "a method of asymptotic dynamics was developed by kulish and faddeev ( kf ) to address the issue of cancellation of ir divergences at amplitude level @xcite .",
    "they were the first to show that in qed , the asymptotic hamiltonian does not coincide with the free hamiltonian .",
    "kf constructed the asymptotic hamiltonian @xmath0 for qed thus modifying the asymptotic condition to introduce a new space of asymptotic states .",
    "kf further modified the definition of s@xmath1matrix and showed that it is free of ir divergences .",
    "thus the method of asymptotic dynamics proposed by kf replaces , the free hamiltonian by an asymptotic hamiltonian which takes into account the long range interaction between incoming and outgoing states and can be used to construct a set of coherent states as the asymptotic states .",
    "the transition matrix elements formed by using these states are then ir finite .    in light front field theory ( lfft ) , there are two kinds of ir divergences viz .",
    "the _ true _ ir divergences which are the bona - fide divergences of equal - time field theory and which appear when both @xmath2 and @xmath3 approach zero and the _ spurious _ ir divergences that are just a manifestation of ultra - violet divergences of equal - time theory",

    "the details of the calculation can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the coherent state method is based on the observation that for theories with long range interactions or theories having bound states as asymptotic states , the total hamiltonian does not reduce to the free field hamiltonian in the limit @xmath4 . in lfft , the asymptotic hamiltonian @xmath5 ,",

    "this hamiltonian is then be used to construct the asymptotic mller operator and the coherent states . the true ir divergences corresponding to @xmath21 are expected to disappear when one uses this coherent state basis to calculate the transition matrix elements .",
