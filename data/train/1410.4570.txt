    "the study of chemical abundance variations in globular clusters ( gcs ) has a long history , the essence of which is captured in reviews by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "recent work has vastly increased the number of gcs in which such variations are observed as well as the sample size in a given cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and so on ) .",
    "these studies highlight the spread in light elements , especially the well - established anticorrelations between oxygen and sodium and , to a lesser extent , magnesium and aluminum .",
    "these variations are connected with the products of nuclear burning at temperatures appropriate for the hot cno cycle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in intermediate- and high - mass stars , though the exact source of the nucleosynthesis site and nature of the pollution mechanism remain the subject of debate .",
    "identifying distinct sequences within a single gc solely from photometry began with the red giant branch ( rgb ; * ? ? ? * ) and main sequence ( ms ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of @xmath0 centauri .",
    "photometric discovery of multiple sequences has accelerated with the sensitivity and resolution of detectors on board the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ , see @xcite for a review of discoveries up until that time .",
    "the uvis and ir channels of the _ hst _ wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) are the most effective means of detecting multiple photometric sequences available at present ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the link between multiple stellar sequences in the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , as observed photometrically , and light - element abundance variations , as observed spectroscopically , is an area of active research .",
    "meanwhile , there have been a handful of studies that model the appearance of multiple stellar populations in gcs .",
    "the first major work on the influence of light - element adundance variations on stellar evolution models is that of @xcite , who compared stellar evolution models with a typical @xmath1-enhanced abundance pattern ( oxygen - rich ) to models with a composition reflective of the extreme end of the observed abundance variations ( oxygen - poor ) .",
    "salaris et al .  found that the abundance variations produce quite a small spread in effective temperature ( @xmath2 ) for coeval populations and , therefore , cmds comprising broadband , optical filters could only show large spreads in the presence of a significant variation in helium .",
    "@xcite expanded the basti database of stellar evolution models to include light - element variations following the same abundance pattern as @xcite , with masses from 0.4 to @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite made the first systematic comparison of model atmospheres and synthetic spectra from 3,000 to 10,000  computed with the abundance patterns of @xcite .",
    "models were computed for [ fe / h]=@xmath4 at 8 different @xmath2-log(g ) pairs corresponding to ms , subgiant , and red giant stars in the basti isochrones .",
    "the authors found modest differences in the atmosphere structures due to variations in the light elements . on the other hand ,",
    "the synthetic spectra and associated colour transformations were significantly influenced by differences in the absorption of carbon- , nitrogen- , and oxygen - bearing molecules at wavelengths shorter than 4,000 , while leaving longer wavelengths essentially unchanged ; the near - infrared was not considered .    sbordone et al .",
    "recommend broadband u and b filters , as well as strmgren u , v , and y , to maximise the separation of gc stars in the cmd .",
    "the authors found that increasing the helium content made essentially no change to the model atmospheres and synthetic spectra and , thus , its influence is restricted to the interior models ( in agreement with * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite found the separation of the sequences in a variety of cmds to be consistent with observations but made no direct comparison between their models and photometry .",
    "@xcite used the _ hst _ photometry of ngc6397 @xcite and predictions for the enhancement of helium , carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen at the metallicity of the cluster to estimate the allowed spread in helium of 2% by mass ( @xmath5 ) assuming c+n+o remains roughly constant or as much as 4% ( @xmath6 ) if c+n+o is allowed to increase along with helium .",
    "the photometry used in this case was limited to the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands that are insensitive to abundance variations ( see * ? ? ? * and sections [ atm ] and [ dsep ] of this paper ) .",
    "this paper presents a case study of the galactic gc ngc6752 that , due to its proximity and other distinguishing characteristics , has been the focus of significant observational effort in both spectroscopy @xcite and photometry @xcite .",
    "these complimentary data sets invite a careful , data - driven study of ngc6752 .",
    "the collective works of yong , grundahl , and collaborators on ngc6752 are particularly useful in the sense that their data set includes sufficient information to piece together more - or - less the full picture of light element variations for more than 20 red giants .",
    "furthermore , the abundance of nitrogen is derived not from cn , but from nh , whose measurement is independent of the carbon abundance .",
    "sufficient information is present in this data set to accurately model , in detail , the stars in ngc6752 with very little in the way of assumptions regarding the abundances that are significant for stellar evolution models @xcite as well as for synthetic spectra and the associated bolometric corrections that are necessary to compare stellar evolution models to photometry .",
    "the _ hst _ photometry presented by @xcite comprises data reaching down the ms in 15 filters from @xmath9 in the the ultraviolet ( uv ) to @xmath10 in the near - infrared ( near - ir ) ; see their table 1 for details .",
    "the multiple sequences revealed in these data exhibit a complex range of behaviors .",
    "based on these observations , milone et al .",
    "have identified three stellar populations ( labeled a , b , and c ) that can be traced through different evolutionary phases in the cmds .",
    "the rgb stars in these populations can also be matched with the spectroscopic targets of yong et al .",
    "; this allows average abundances to be estimated for each population ( table 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "the goal of the paper is to use the available abundance measurements to compute self - consistent stellar atmosphere and evolution models of stars at either end of the range of abundance variations ( that is , for populations a and c ) and then compare the _ hst _ photometry with those models along the ms .",
    "the stellar atmospheres and synthetic spectra are computed with two independent codes .",
    "if the models are successful in tracing the observed sequences , then they constitute a powerful tool for interpreting the observed behavior in terms of the physical conditions found along the ms of ngc6752 and , by extension , other gcs for which observations of comparable quantity may be obtained .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows : section [ abund ] lays out the abundances that will be used to construct models ; full details are included as an appendix .",
    "section [ atm ] describes the stellar atmosphere and spectrum synthesis codes and the models made by them .",
    "section [ dsep ] describes the stellar evolution models and isochrones .",
    "section [ hst ] presents detailed comparisons of the transformed isochrones with the _ hst _ photometry .",
    "section [ conclusions ] summarises the important results and discusses future directions for this work .",
    "we have adopted the collection of abundances reported by @xcite . in particular , we refer to the photometric identification of stellar populations a and c by @xcite and their average abundances summarised in table 2 of that paper .",
    "while @xcite have also identified an intermediate population ( b ) , we have chosen not to include it in this study because our main goal is to discover how well stellar models are able to describe stars at the upper and lower extremes of the light - element abundance distributions .",
    "if the models are able to reproduce the observed features in populations a and c , then we are confident they will perform equally well when applied to population b.    in addition to the published abundances , we have added measurements of carbon in 14 red giants ( yong et al . , in preparation ) in order to derive representative carbon abundances for populations a and c. since the spectroscopic measurements do not include ne , we have set [ ne / fe]=+0.4 in both populations .",
    "we have not included variations in elements heavier than copper because these elements are under - abundant to begin with and show only slight variations ( not more than 0.2 dex ) .",
    "these heavier elements are expected to have negligible influence on the properties of stellar evolution models in the h - r diagram and cmd .",
    "the results from yong et al .",
    "( in preparation ) indicate that the total c+n+o abundance is constant to within the measurement uncertainties ( @xmath11 dex ) across all populations in ngc6752 ."
