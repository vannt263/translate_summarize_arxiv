    "in nature cooperative behavior amongst individuals is widely spread .",
    "it is observed in animals , e.g. @xcite , as well as in microorganisms , e.g. @xcite . in the attempt to understand this phenomenon by models , theoretical approaches introduced different interpretations and forms of cooperation , mostly within the area of game theory @xcite . in all such approaches ,",
    "a defector ( or selfish ) type tends to have more offspring , but there are cases when it is outcompeted by the cooperator type under some circumstances .",
    "although in all of the models describing cooperation the question of extinction and survival of a type or the coexistence of several types are main subjects of the mathematical analysis , the frameworks for the theoretical studies may vary . while ( stochastic ) differential equations",
    "are mainly used for non - spatial systems ( see for example @xcite ) , the theory of interacting particle systems provides a suitable setup for the analysis of models with local interactions between the particles , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we define a model using the latter structure and terminology .",
    "investigations of models incorporating cooperation are interesting because of the following dichotomy : in non - spatial ( well - mixed ) situations , the whole population benefits from the cooperative behavior . if defectors have a higher fitness than cooperators , defectors always outcompete cooperators in the long run . however , if the system is truly spatial , cooperators can form clusters and then use their cooperative behavior in order to defend themselves against defectors , even though those might have higher ( individual ) fitness .",
    "this heuristics suggests that only structured models can help to understand cooperative behavior in nature . for the model studied in the present paper",
    ", we will make it precise in proposition [ prop : unstructured ] for extinction of cooperators in a non - spatial system and in theorem  [ thm : ext_surv ] for extinction of defectors in a spatial system , if cooperation is strong enough .    due to the variety of interpretations of cooperative behavior",
    "there are different ways of implementing these mechanisms in a spatial context . in the field of population dynamics , sturm and swart @xcite",
    "study an interacting particle system containing a cooperative - branching mechanism which can be understood as a sexual reproduction event . in @xcite ,",
    "blath and kurt study a branching - annihilating random walk and again , a cooperation mechanism is interpreted as sexual reproduction .",
    "in contrast , the model introduced by evilsizor and lanchier in @xcite originates from the game - theoretical study of a two player game with different strategies where the strategies can be altruistic or selfish . here",
    ", the altruistic strategies represent the cooperator type .",
    "we discuss the findings of these models to our results in section  [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "various interacting particle systems which appear in the literature are attractive , i.e.  two versions of the system , which start in configurations where one dominates the other , can be coupled such that this property holds for all times ; see e.g.  @xcite for an attractive model mentioned above . for such processes , there exist several general results ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) which provide some useful techniques helping in the analysis .",
    "however , cooperation often leads to non - attractive interacting particle systems ; see @xcite and the one presented here .",
    "the reason here is that cooperators ( or altruists ) do not distinguish between non - cooperators and their own type which usually contradicts attractiveness .",
    "the motivation for the present paper came from studies of bacterial cells in the context of public - good - dilemmas , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the idea is that there are two types ( defector=0 , cooperator=1 ) , where only cooperators produce some public good which helps neighboring cells to reproduce .",
    "however , this production is costly which means that defectors will have a selective advantage over the cooperator type .",
    "the resulting model is a biased voter model with an additional cooperation mechanism .",
    "the main objective of our paper is to study the long - time behavior of such a model dependent on the parameters of the system .    in particular",
    ", we prove for our main model in one dimension from definition  [ def : model].3 , that the system clusters independently of the parameter configuration . when starting in a translation invariant configuration , for @xmath3 , defectors take over the population , whereas for @xmath4 cooperators win",
    "; see theorem  [ thm : ext_surv ] .",
    "additionally , in higher dimensions , at least we can show that the parameter region where defecting particles win is larger than for @xmath5 ; see theorem  [ thm : ext_surv2 ] .",
    "we also show that a finite number of cooperators dies out if @xmath3 , but may survive if @xmath4 .",
    "the converse holds true for defectors ; see theorem  [ thm : complete_conv ] . what remains to be seen",
    "is if there are parameter combinations such that cooperators win also in higher dimensions .",
    "some preliminary results in the limit of small parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 or very large @xmath1 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "first , we give a general definition of the model in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "after the definition we derive some properties of the model , show its existence and consider some special cases and related systems . in section [ sec :",
    "result ] we state limit results for the main model and its derivatives , mainly restricted to the one - dimensional lattice .",
    "subsequently , in section [ sec : comparison ] , we compare our results with those obtained in similar models , e.g.  from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to the proofs of the theorems .",

    "we speak of a cooperative system .    in order to uniquely define a markov process",

    "the difference between the avmbc and the cvmbc becomes smaller in high dimensions suggesting survival of cooperators for large @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , clustering is usually more difficult in higher dimensions but cooperators can only survive due to clustering .",
    "first simulation results for @xmath114 and @xmath115 show that survival of cooperators is unlikely in the avmbc .",
    "another cooperation mechanism we might consider arises if cooperators only help other cooperators , i.e. the cells recognize related cells . in ecological literature",
    "this behavior is called kin - recognition or kin - discrimination , see @xcite for an overview . as to the theoretical behavior of the model",
    "this changes the transition rate in , i.e. if @xmath24 then @xmath125 here , cooperators are less likely to die and hence , this process dominates the cvmbc .",
    "in particular , for translation invariant initial conditions , defectors die out for @xmath4 in one dimension . moreover , as can be seen from a calculation similar as in the proof of lemma  [ l : dominance ] , a biased voter model , where type  0 is favored , still dominates this process for @xmath3 .",
    "hence , we also have that cooperators die out in this case and the same results as in theorem  [ thm : ext_surv ] hold .    since cooperators always die out in @xmath5 for the avmbc ( as long as @xmath62 ) , we focus on the cvmbc in the sequel .",

    "importantly , in both models , enlargement of existing clusters can be strong enough in order to outcompete the beneficial ( or unoccupied ) type .",
    "the model studied in @xcite  called the death - birth updating process",

    "we prove the general case by using martingale theory .",
    "we assume without loss of generality that @xmath198 for all @xmath199 .",
    "( otherwise , we use a time - rescaling . note that this rescaling is bounded by assumption   and therefore , @xmath192 holds iff it holds for the rescaled process . )    we first show that there exists @xmath200 such that for all @xmath201 , the process @xmath202 is a positive @xmath187-super - martingale . for this , consider the ( time - dependent ) generator of the process @xmath134 applied to the function @xmath203 which yields at time @xmath14 @xmath204 for @xmath205 . noting that for all @xmath14 , we have that @xmath206 and @xmath207 by , we find @xmath200 such that @xmath208 for all @xmath209 and all @xmath177 , which means that @xmath202 is an @xmath187-super - martingale . by the martingale convergence theorem",
    ", it converges almost surely and  since the sum of rates is bounded away from  @xmath23  the only possible almost sure limit is  0 .",
    "now , 1 .  follows since @xmath210 if and only if @xmath211 for some @xmath212 . for 2 . , the process @xmath213 is a non - negative supermartingale by optional stopping .",

    ", we have @xmath3 .",
    "the assertion is a consequence of the coupling with the biased voter model from lemma [ l : dominance ] ( with bias @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) .",
    "since the biased voter model dominates the cvmbc and type  1 dies out in the biased voter model ( [ rem : biasvoter ] ) , the same is true for the cvmbc .",
    "the proof of ( ii ) is more involved .",
    "we have to show that cooperators survive almost surely when started in a non - trivial translation invariant configuration .",
    "therefore , we analyze an arbitrary cluster of cooperators and show that the size of such a cluster has a positive probability to diverge off to infinity .",
    "note that the flanking regions of a cluster of cooperators can have three different forms : @xmath217 these are the only possible environments a cluster of cooperators can encounter in one dimension .",
    "note that a cluster can also only consist of a single cooperator .",
    "the dynamics of the cluster size depends on the environment .",
    "precisely , by the dynamics of the process , we obtain the following . a cluster of size @xmath218 @xmath219 under the assumptions of theorem  [ thm : ext_surv ] ,",
    "let @xmath220 be a stochastic process representing the cluster of cooperators which is closest to the origin and contains at least two cooperators .",
    "( if there is no such cluster at time 0 , wait for some time @xmath221 and pick the cluster then . )",
    "we will show that @xmath222 for this , we compare @xmath223 with a jump process @xmath224 as in corollary  [ cor:2 ] , where the jump rates at times @xmath14 are given as follows : @xmath225 moreover , this process is stopped when reaching  1 . by the comparison in , we see that we can couple @xmath226 and @xmath227 such that @xmath228 , at least until @xmath227 reaches  1 .",
    "since the jump rates of @xmath227 indeed satisfy @xmath229 for all times @xmath177 we find @xmath230 with positive probability which implies that @xmath231 holds as well .",
    "still , we need to make sure that the cluster does not wander to @xmath232 . for this , consider both boundaries of the cluster if it has grown to a large extent .",
    "the right boundary is again bounded from below by a jump process of the form as in corollary  [ cor:2 ] with @xmath233 and @xmath234 for the cases a and b ( note that the right boundary alone of case c is already captured by the right boundaries of the cases a and b ) .",
    "so , again , we see from corollary  [ cor:2 ] that the right border of the cluster goes to infinity with positive probability .",
    "the same holds for the left border of the cluster which tends to @xmath235 .",
    "therefore , we have shown .",
    "now we use to show that defectors indeed go extinct .",
    "note that , from the argument given above , the probability of survival of a cluster of cooperators depends on the environment , but is bounded away from  0 by some @xmath236 .",
    "we start at time @xmath23 with a cluster of cooperators which has at least probability @xmath237 to survive as proved above . in case",
    "it survives we are done , otherwise it goes extinct in finite time and has at most merged with finitely many other cooperating clusters until then .",
    "thus , at this extinction time we can choose another cluster of cooperators which exists due to the translation invariance of the starting configuration .",
    "this cluster again has a probability of survival of at least @xmath237 independently of the history of the interacting particle system .",
    "this allows for a borel - cantelli - argument showing that when repeating these steps arbitrarily often eventually one of the cooperating clusters survives .",
    "this happens at the latest after a geometrically distributed number of attempts and thus in finite time .",
    "hence , we have @xmath238 for all @xmath13 and we are done .    for ( iii ) , in order to prove clustering in the case @xmath239 , there are actually two proofs .",
    "one relies on the dual lattice and the study of process of cluster interfaces , which performs annihilating random walks .",
    "this technique would even show clustering for all parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 . however , we show clustering by studying the probability of finding a cluster edge in the special case @xmath2 . clustering for the other parameter configurations",
    "was already shown in ( i ) and ( ii ) since extinction also implies clustering of the process .",
    "for our method , we write @xmath240 for @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "we have to show that @xmath243 since then  by translation invariance  every configuration carrying both types has vanishing probability for @xmath244 .",
    "we start with the dynamics of @xmath245 , which reads ( recall that @xmath2 ) @xmath246 since @xmath247 $ ] , this probability has to converge for @xmath244 , hence @xmath248 , and therefore @xmath249 now , consider the dynamics of @xmath250 , which is @xmath251 since we know that @xmath252 by  , and because @xmath253 $ ] , we also have that @xmath254 we now conclude with @xmath255 which shows  .",
    "\\(i ) we use the comparison with the biased voter model from lemma  [ l:44 ] .",
    "therefore , we have that @xmath124 if and only if @xmath256 .",
    "since for this choice of parameters type  1 goes extinct in the biased voter model which dominates the avmbc , we are done .",
    "+ ( ii ) for @xmath5 and the nearest neighbor random walk , the altruistic mechanism is such that a configuration @xmath257 ( or @xmath258 ) turns into @xmath259 at rate @xmath260 .",
    "the same holds for the cvmbc with selection rate @xmath261 .",
    "in addition , @xmath262 ( or @xmath263 ) turns to @xmath264 at rate @xmath122 , which is the same as for the cvmbc with cooperation parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this shows that the transition rates for the altruistic process @xmath166 satisfy : + if @xmath265 , then @xmath266 these resemble the transition rates of a cvmbc with selection rate @xmath267 and cooperation rate @xmath268 , see also equations and . in particular",

    "let @xmath269 be the number of finite clusters in @xmath110 with sizes @xmath270 . if the process starts with finitely many defectors ( cooperators ) , @xmath271 are sizes of clusters of defectors ( cooperators ) , and @xmath272 are sizes of clusters of cooperators ( defectors ) .",

    "we assume that @xmath278 .",
    "note that @xmath279 is odd and remains so until it hits @xmath153 from where it may or may not jump to @xmath23 . in order to prove the claim",
    "we show that the hitting time @xmath280 is finite almost surely . for this",
    ", it suffices to show that @xmath281 almost surely , since by time @xmath282 , some cluster has size  1 and there is a positive chance that @xmath68 decreases at the next transition . if @xmath68 does not decrease , there is the next chance after another finite time and eventually , @xmath68 will decrease .    if @xmath283 , consider the size @xmath284 of a cluster of cooperators . before time @xmath282 , all clusters have size at least  2 , so @xmath284 jumps @xmath285 hence @xmath286 is dominated by a symmetric random walk with jump rate @xmath287 , stopped when hitting  @xmath153 , which implies that @xmath288 almost surely due to the recurrence of the symmetric random walk in one dimension . if @xmath132 , the same argument shows that @xmath288 if the role of cooperators and defectors is exchanged .",
    "hence we have proved and 1 .",
    "is shown .",
    "if @xmath275 and @xmath283 , the remaining finite cluster must consist of defectors ( since the argument used in 1 .",
    "shows that a finite cluster of cooperators would die out ) .",
    "therefore , in case ( ii ) , we must have that @xmath289 if @xmath290 , the remaining finite cluster consists of cooperators for the same reason .",
    "hence , in ( iii ) , we must have that @xmath289 thus , we have shown 2 .",
    "\\3 . as just argued in 1 .",
    "if @xmath275 the remaining finite cluster must contain the stronger type , i.e.defectors for @xmath291 and cooperators for @xmath4 .",
