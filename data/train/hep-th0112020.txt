    "the brane - world scenario offers possible solutions to the hierarchy problem @xcite and it predicts new effects , like modifications of newton s force law at short distances @xcite , modifications of the cosmological evolution at early times @xcite and the existence of `` faster - than - light '' gravitational signals @xcite . the last effect is due to the fact that , while the standard model fields ( namely the photons ) are confined to live only inside the brane world - volume , gravity can see the whole higher - dimensional space - time .",
    "consequently , a `` shorter '' path that leaves the brane , propagates through the bulk , and re - enters the brane later may exist for gravitons .",
    "this effect was pointed out in ref.@xcite , where the authors argued that all points in the visible universe can be connected in an arbitrarily short amount of time .",
    "the effect was also used in ref.@xcite to give a solution to the horizon problem without using inflation . in ref.@xcite",
    "the author argues that however , closed time - like curves do not form , and therefore causality is maintained .",
    "the causal structure and the horizon problem in the absence of inflation are also studied in ref.@xcite , and the holographic interpretation of the lorentz invariance violations is given in ref.@xcite .    since the 5d space - time is usually chosen to be ads - schwarzschild ( adss ) or ads - reissner - nrdstrom ( ads - rn ) in order to localize gravity and reproduce newton s law in the brane",
    ", the 5d metric has the general form of ref.@xcite : [ addss_metric ] ds^2=-f(r)dt^2+r^2d_k^2 + the 4d universe is seen as a 3-brane moving through this background . since there is no preferred orientation of the brane , there is no reason to expect lorentz invariance on the brane .",
    "the problem is addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite.the proper time of a 4d observer ( as a function of the 5th dimension ) changes differently than the scale factor of the space coordinates .",
    "consequently , the effective speed of light changes as a function of the position along the 5th dimension , and it is possible that , in a given coordinate time interval , a gravitational wave signal traveling outside our visible universe will move over larger distances than light wave signals traveling inside the visible universe . the same effect can affect the standard model particles if they are assumed to be localized modes of bulk fields , the particles being allowed to `` tunnel '' into the bulk ( see ref.@xcite ) .    in ref.@xcite",
    "the authors use the more general ads - rn bulk and they consider only flat 3-dimensional spatial slices of the visible universe . additionally they impose the existence of an event horizon in the bulk , and these constraints require the existence of exotic matter on the brane .    in the present work",
    "we discuss the conditions under which the geodesics will return to the brane and we estimate the relative advance of the gravitational signal with respect to the light signal traveling along the brane .",
    "we will consider more generic situations , without constraining the curvature to be zero , but assume that the cosmic scale factor of the universe is large at present .",
    "the static and the expanding cases will be treated separately since we will see that we can not take the limit @xmath0 in the expanding case .",
    "the analysis of the 5d null geodesics is essentially that of ref.@xcite , ( see ref.@xcite for a more complete analysis including time - like and space - like geodesics ) but in addition we explicitly impose the condition that the geodesics return to the brane .",
    "only then such apparent lorentz invariance violations can be detected by a brane observer .",
    "we also use the analogy with the bending of light in 4d schwarzschild spacetime , to study the bending of `` gravitational rays '' around the bulk black hole .",
    "since an expanding universe is not described by a minkowski metric , therefore , lorenz invariance is already broken by the expansion of the universe .",
    "we should rather call such effects `` causality violations '' . however , as explained in ref.@xcite , the 4d effective action for a field that can propagate through the bulk is not lorentz invariant , so we call such effects lorentz invariance violations .",
    "we also address the question whether such apparently superluminal signals can solve the horizon problem in the absence of inflation .",
    "we find that for both the static and the expanding universes the gravitational wave traveling through the bulk reaches a brane observer before a light wave emitted from the same source as the gravitational wave , but traveling along the brane . also if our brane separates two different adss spaces , there will be two different gravitational waves traveling through the two bulks , each reaching a brane observer at different times , both before a light wave traveling along the brane .",
    "regarding the horizon problem , we find that it is possible for the bulk signals to travel far enough to homogenize the universe we see today .",
    "however , the signals are redshifted by the gravitational field of the bulk black hole , and it is unlikely that they will carry enough energy back to the brane to have a significant effect on homogenizing the universe .",
    "the light - ray approximation used to calculate the advance of the bulk gravitational waves with respect to the electromagnetic signal traveling along the brane is valid only if the wavelength of the graviton is much smaller than the curvature radius of the adss bulk : @xmath1 .",
    "if the wavelength is comparable or larger than the the adss curvature radius , then we should study fluctuations around the adss background , describing the propagation of a gravitational wave .",
    "the effective 4d cosmological constant is given by : _",
    "eff=4 - 1l^2 if the brane tension is of the order of @xmath2 then the bulk cosmological constant must be of the same order of magnitude in order to give the small observed 4d cosmological constant .",
    "consequently the calculation of the advance of the gravitational signal is valid only for gravitons with energies of the order of @xmath2 , impossible to observe with ligo .",
    "we study the propagation of a signal through the adss bulk , with the aim to find which geodesics will leave the brane and re - intersect it . for simplicity we first study the stationary brane :",
    "the position of the brane along the 5th dimension simultaneously satisfies @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( see appendix [ static_brane_solutions ] ) .",
    "we use the setup of ref.@xcite in which the brane separates two ( not necessarily identical ) adss spaces described by the metric eq.([addss_metric ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath5 has the general form of ref.@xcite : has one extra term : @xmath6 f(r)=k+- we will see that the existence of killing vectors makes ( at least for the moment ) the explicit form of @xmath5 irrelevant .",
    "we are interested in finding the null geodesics of the adss space - time .",
    "we will allow only 3 coordinates to change , namely , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "depending on the curvature of the 3d spatial sections , this metric is of one of the following three forms : & & d_k^2=d^2+h()(d^2+^2d^2 ) + & & h()=\\ {    lrc ^2 ( ) & k=+1 + ^2 & k=0 + ^2 ( ) & k=-1    .",
    "since we keep @xmath10 and @xmath11 constant , the explicit form of @xmath12 is irrelevant . with this restriction",
    "the metric for which we want to find the geodesics is : [ short_metric ] ds^2=-f(r)dt^2+r^2d^2 + we notice that , up to specifying the explicit form of @xmath5 , this metric is identical with the 4d schwarzschild metric with the restriction @xmath13 .",

    "^ = 0 but we can use the fact that fictitious space - time described by the metric ( [ short_metric ] ) possesses the killing vector fields : @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "we obtain two prime integrals : & & ( ) ^ ( ) g_=const . -f(r)=-e + & & ( ) ^ ( ) g_=const .",
    "r^2=p one may argue that the original metric does not possess the killing vector field @xmath15 , but the same results can be obtained by integrating the geodesic equations .",
    "the geodesic equations for the @xmath7 and @xmath9 coordinates are : & & + = 0 + & & + = 0 they can be written in the form : = 0 & & r^2=const .",
    "+ = 0 & & f(r)=const . which coincides with the previous result .",
    "using these two prime integrals and the fact that the tangent vector to the geodesic is a null vector : -f(r)()^2 + r^2d()^2 + ( ) ^2=0 we obtain the following prime integrals that allow us to discuss the properties of the geodesics .",
    "[ t_equation ] & & = + [ sigma_equation ] & & = + [ r_equation ] & & = e using the analogy with the bending of light calculations , in fig.2 we represent @xmath9 as an angular variable .",
    "since in the present setup ( see ref.@xcite ) the coordinate @xmath8 decreases on either side of the brane , we are only interested in geodesics that are contained in the space delimited by the brane and the horizon , as illustrated in fig.1",
    ".    we can now proceed to analyze the propagation of the bulk null signals and find out how they are perceived by a brane observer .",
    "more precisely we want to find which geodesics can start on the brane , travel through the bulk , and re - intersect the brane .",
    "then we find the separation of the two events ( emission , re - entry ) as seen by a brane observer .",
    "we now want to find those geodesics that will be emitted from the brane , travel through the bulk and re - intersect the brane .",
    "since the @xmath8 coordinate decreases on both sides of the brane , the geodesics will first move toward decreasing @xmath8 so in eq.([r_equation ] ) we have to choose the `` - '' sign .",
    "the brane is either located at a fixed @xmath8 , or moving toward larger @xmath8 ( corresponding to an expanding universe ) , so in order for the geodesics to re - intersect the brane they have to reach a turning point after which they move toward increasing @xmath8 .",
    "the movement toward increasing @xmath8 corresponds to the `` + '' sign in eq.([r_equation ] ) so in order to switch between the initial `` - '' sign to the `` + '' sign , @xmath16 must be zero at the turning point . moreover , the turning point must be outside the horizon of the bulk black hole , since it will take null signals an infinite coordinate time to reach the horizon , so these signals do not re - intersect the brane .",
    "we will study the zeroes of the function : @xmath17 since these zeroes give the location of the turning point of the bulk null geodesics .",
    "the equation becomes : 1-(1l^2 + -)=0 first , the locations of the adss horizons are given by the zeroes of the function @xmath18 .",

    "the induced metric on the brane is @xmath112 and since the brane expands , in the @xmath75 description it moves towards increasing @xmath104 , i.e. away from the black hole .",

    "this results in the first red - shift term in eq.([shifted_time_bulk ] ) .",
    "when the signal re - enters the brane , both the brane and the signal move towards increasing @xmath104 , which results in the second red - shift term .    we now want to relate @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , @xmath116 with the proper time of a brane observer . by doing so we get an estimate of the red - shift of the signal as seen by a brane observer .",

    "the typical energy of the bulk signals at emission is the temperature of the radiation on the brane , so at the moment of re - entry the signal must have an energy equal to the new temperature of the radiation . the doppler effect only increases the redshift of the bulk signal .",
    "the energy of the signal re - entering the brane being smaller than the typical energy of a cmb photon , we will need large numbers of bulk signals , comparable to the number of photons in the cmb , in order to homogenize the universe .",
