    "the potential complexity of the magnetic interactions in this system is reduced by the absence of charge and orbital ordering of mn @xmath22 electrons suggested by our x - ray diffraction data .",
    "the absence of charge and orbital ordering in this system is most likely caused by the pinned charge disorder introduced by the random cr substitution , randomizing coulomb interactions amongst carriers and locally removing the @xmath22 orbital degeneracy .",
