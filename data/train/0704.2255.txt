    "the neutron star  in the center of supernova remnant  is the first discovered @xcite and most intensively studied of the so - called central compact objects ( ccos ) .",

    "more recently , accumulated x - ray observations of  were presented as showing large - amplitude changes of both sign in its spin period @xcite that were unlike any other pulsar and difficult to explain .",
    "consequently , the surface dipole magnetic field , which is a key parameter in all proposed mechanisms for the x - ray absorption lines , could not be estimated independently from the spin - down rate , which was indeterminate . in this letter , we present a definitive study of the spin history of  that corrects previous errors in the data and their analysis .",

    "several epic - pn data sets had photon timing errors uncorrected in their original processing @xcite .",
    "we reprocessed all epic data using the emchain and epchain scripts under science analysis system ( sas ) version xmmsas_20060628_1801 - 7.0.0 , which produces correct photon time assignments .",
    "the observations were affected by background to varying degree . to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio in each , we adjusted the source extraction aperture individually . for this soft source , an energy cut of @xmath15  kev",
    "was found to maximize pulsed power .",
    "we also examined data simultaneously available from the epic  mos camera , operated in `` full frame '' mode .",
    "although not useful for timing purposes ( 2.7  s readout ) , the location of the source at the center of the on - axis mos ccd allows a better background measurement to test for flux variability , an important indicator of accretion , than the epic - pn sw mode .",

    "for each observation in table  [ logtable ] we transformed the photon arrival times from  to barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) using the coordinates given in table  [ ephemeris ] , and identified the pulsed signal using a standard fft . to obtain a most precise value of the period in each observation we then generated a periodogram using a @xmath17 test @xcite around the fft value .",
    "the @xmath18 uncertainty in @xmath19 was determined by the monte - carlo method described in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the large period changes claimed by @xcite , a linear ephemeris is an excellent fit to our derived periods ( see fig .  [ periodplot ] ) , with @xmath20 for 12 degrees - of - freedom , and no significant detection of a period derivative .",

    "now knowing the precise and consistent values of @xmath19 in 2002 and 2005 , we were able to make a phase - connected combination of the 2001 december _ xmm - newton_observation and the 2002 january _ chandra _  one , which are 13 days apart , by finding an exact period match for the correct peak from among nearby aliases .",
    "finally , we combined the set of two _ chandra_observations spanning 2003 june 1019 , which again yielded a consistent period at the highest peak in the @xmath23 periodogram . after making these coherent combinations , it was not possible to achieve a further phase - connected solution over a longer time span , as the intervening cycle counts could not be determined uniquely .",

    ", the @xmath3 upper limit on @xmath4 implies , for an isolated pulsar , an energy loss rate @xmath35  ergs  s@xmath2 , surface magnetic field strength @xmath36  g , and characteristic age @xmath37  myr . in its spin properties ,  is nearly a twin of another cco , @xcite .",
    "the next section closely follows the discussion in @xcite , which anticipated the present result .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of  is of thermal origin , with @xmath10 ergs  s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this is much larger than the upper limit on its spin - down power , @xmath11 , and argues that it is mostly residual cooling .",
    "however , fits to the spectrum require two blackbody components ; the hotter one , of temperature @xmath38  kev , has an area of only 0.87  km@xmath39 @xcite , which may indicate heating by accretion onto the polar cap .",
    "the canonical area of the open - field - line polar cap is @xmath40  km@xmath39 .",
    "this is @xmath41 of the fitted blackbody component , but accretion may cover a wider area .",
    "the characteristic age @xmath42  myr , compared to the remnant age , estimated as @xmath43  kyr with an uncertainty of a factor of 3 @xcite , requires that pulsar was born spinning at its current period .",
    "a recent population analysis of radio pulsars favors a wide distribution of birth periods @xcite , in which 424  ms would be typical .",
    "furthermore , as magnetic field is generated by a turbulent dynamo whose strength depends on the rotation rate of the proto - neutron star @xcite , it is natural that pulsars born spinning slowly would have the weaker @xmath14-fields ; the model of @xcite supports this .",
    "there are no young radio pulsars with @xmath44  g. since is not necessarily beyond the radio pulsar death line , either empirical @xcite or theoretical @xcite , there may be another reason it is radio quiet .",
    "it is possible that low - level accretion of sn debris prevents ccos from becoming radio pulsars for thousands or even millions of years",
    ". accretion from a fallback disk @xcite was one of the theories considered by @xcite to explain the now defunct timing irregularities of .",
    "but accretion may still be needed to account for its radio - quiet and x - ray - hot properties .",
    "if the magnetic field is weak enough that an accretion disk can penetrate the light cylinder , the hotter portion of the ns surface in  can be powered by accretion of only @xmath45 g  s@xmath2 .",
    "it is required that @xmath46  g for  to be able to accrete in the propeller regime .",
    "but in this limit , the pulsar would tend to spin down at a rate that is excluded by observations , @xmath47 where the magnetic moment @xmath48 g  @xmath49 .",
    "also , @xmath50 would have to be greater than @xmath51 g  s@xmath2 , as most of the accreting matter is expelled from the magnetospheric radius rather than accreted .",
    "however , if @xmath52  g , then  may accrete as a `` slow rotator , '' and spin up at a small rate , @xmath53 in this regime , secular spin - up , and torque noise , which may be of the same magnitude , are below the sensitivity of the existing measurements .",
    "while flickering is also an indicator of accretion , we do not have strong evidence of variability of  ( @xmath54 on month timescales ) .",
    "also , upper limits on optical / ir emission from  are comparable to that expected from a geometrically thin , optically thick disk accreting at the rate required to account for its x - ray luminosity @xcite",
    ". therefore , it may be necessary to invoke a radiatively inefficient flow in order to consider accretion",
    ".      broad absorption lines in the soft x - ray spectrum of  are centered at @xmath55  kev and @xmath56  kev @xcite , and possibly at 2.1  kev and 2.8  kev @xcite , although the reality of the two higher - energy features has been disputed @xcite .",
    "proposed absorption mechanisms include electron cyclotron in a weak ( @xmath57  g ) magnetic field @xcite , atomic features from singly ionized helium in a strong ( @xmath58  g ) field @xcite , and iron @xcite , or oxygen / neon in a normal ( @xmath59  g ) field @xcite .    our upper limit , @xmath6  g , favors the electron cyclotron model , for at least one of the lines , over all others that require stronger fields .",
    "the cyclotron prediction , @xmath60  g , assumes that 0.7  kev is the fundamental energy @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the gravitational redshift .",
    "another solution postulates hydrogenic oxygen for the 0.7  kev kine , while the 1.4  kev line is the cyclotron fundamental @xcite .",
    "as these authors pointed out , abundant oxygen may be accreted from supernova debris .",
    "one caveat , however , is that the magnetic field strength at the ns surface can be larger in places than the global dipole that determines the spin - down rate .",
    "the half dozen radio - quiet ccos are similar in their x - ray luminosities , high temperatures , and absence of pulsar wind nebulae .",
    "therefore , they may comprise a fairly uniform class defined by a weak magnetic field , which in turn results from slow natal rotation .",
    "if accreting , a slow initial spin is still unavoidable , since even at eddington - limited accretion rates , the spin - up and spin - down time scales in  3.1 and in @xcite are much longer than the ages of the remnants .",
    "while we do not have definite evidence of accretion in any cco , small @xmath13 and large @xmath19 both make it possible for a pulsar to accrete at low rates from a sn debris disk ; the large @xmath13 and rapid spin of young radio pulsars prevents such a disk from penetrating the light cylinder . in order to test the general applicability of these results to the class of ccos , more sensitives searches for their pulsations",
    "are required .",
    "however , prior null results on all of them suggest that their pulsed amplitudes are very small .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of all timing data on the x - ray pulsar has resolved the dilemma of its mysterious spin properties by correcting previous errors in data processing and analysis .",
    "it is simply a low magnetic field ns that has no discernible variation in spin over 5 years . if an isolated ns , the upper limit on its spin - down power is much less than its bolometric x - ray luminosity , which leaves only internal cooling and/or accretion as possible energy sources . in either case ,",
    "must have been born with a weak magnetic field and its long rotation period .",
    "we speculate that these two parameters are causally related and , projecting from the near twins  and , possibly the physical basis of the cco class .",
    "an additional benefit of this solution is the new constraint on proposed absorption - line models for  that depend on the magnetic field strength .",
    "our upper limit on the dipole field is close to the prediction of the electron cyclotron model for both lines , and perhaps oxygen for one of the lines . to actually make a significant measurement of @xmath13 as small as @xmath57  g from dipole spin - down would require a fully phase - coherent timing solution spanning @xmath63  yr , assuming that there is no glitch or other timing noise .",
    "such a program would also be sensitive to accretion torques at the lowest rates predicted here for spin - up . in case @xmath13",
    "is as small as @xmath64  g and some of the x - ray luminosity of  is due to accretion from a debris disk , spin - up could be detected .",
    "this investigation is based on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa .",
