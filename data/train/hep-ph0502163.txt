    "however , a profound question arises : since @xmath12 is a sm gauge singlet , why should not there exist a gauge - invariant majorana mass term @xmath13 in the theory ?",
    "in fact , there is a strong theoretical motivation for the majorana mass term to exist since it could naturally explain the smallness of the observed neutrino masses via the so - called  see - saw \" mechanism @xmath14 @xcite . from a model - building point of view",

    "one may also consider constructing generic neutrino mass operators to parameterize the fundamental physics effects in a model - independent manner @xcite .    besides the phenomena of neutrino flavor oscillations and possible new cp - violating phases , the majorana mass term violates lepton number by two units ( @xmath2 ) , which may result in important consequences in particle physics and cosmology .",

    "<S> we consider four lepton - number violating ( @xmath0 ) processes : ( a ) neutrinoless double - beta decay @xmath1 , ( b ) @xmath2 tau decays , ( c ) @xmath2 rare meson decays and ( d ) nuclear muon - positron conversion . in the absence of exotic @xmath0 interactions , </S>",
    "<S> the rates for these processes are determined by effective neutrino masses @xmath3 , which can be related to the sum of light neutrino masses , the neutrino mass - squared differences , the neutrino mixing angles , a dirac phase and two majorana phases . </S>",
    "<S> we sample the experimentally allowed ranges of @xmath3 based on neutrino oscillation experiments as well as cosmological observations , and obtain a stringent upper bound @xmath4 ev . </S>",
    "<S> we then calculate the allowed ranges for @xmath3 from the experimental rates of direct searches for the above @xmath2 processes . comparing our calculated rates with the currently or soon available data , we find that only the @xmath5 experiment may be able to probe @xmath6 with a sensitivity comparable to the current bound . </S>",
    "<S> muon - positron conversion is next in sensitivity , while the limits of direct searches for the other @xmath2 processes are several orders of magnitude weaker than the current bounds on @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> any positive signal in those direct searches would indicate new contributions to the @xmath0 interactions beyond those from three light majorana neutrinos . </S>"
