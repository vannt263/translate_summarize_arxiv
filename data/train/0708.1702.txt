    "the relationship between the orbital state and the physical properties of ytio@xmath8 , along with its antiferromagnetic partner latio@xmath8 , has generated significant recent attention .",

    "direct evidence for an orbitally ordered state akin to that predicted in theoretical work has come from neutron diffraction @xcite .",
    "x - ray absorption @xcite and nuclear quadrupole resonance studies @xcite have yielded supporting evidence",
    ". however , some major questions remain open . while electronic - structure calculations generically predict a strong spatial anisotropy of the superexchange parameters ,",
    "inelastic neutron scattering experiments have revealed an almost isotropic spin wave spectrum @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of orbital excitations recently revealed by raman scattering is also in stark contrast to predictions based on the theoretically proposed orbitally ordered state @xcite .",
    "collective quantum zero - point fluctuations that strongly reduce the orbital order might offer a way out of this conundrum , but theoretical work on this scenario is still in its early stages @xcite .    here",
    "we present a comprehensive ellipsometric study of the optical properties of stoichiometric ytio@xmath8 , following the same methodology as in previous work on lamno@xmath8 @xcite . in lamno@xmath8 , the mott - insulating progenitor of a family of compounds exhibiting colossal magnetoresistance , a realistic quantitative description of the interplay between spin and charge correlations has found possible @xcite .",
    "the four @xmath10-electrons of lamno@xmath8 are subject to a nearly cubic crystal field that splits the energy levels available to these electrons into a higher - lying , doubly degenerate @xmath11 state and a lower - lying , triply degenerate @xmath9 state . following hund s rules ,",
    "these states are occupied by one and three electrons , respectively , so that the @xmath11 valence electron occupies a doubly degenerate level .",
    "this degeneracy is lifted by a cooperative jahn - teller distortion (  orbital order \" ) around 800 k. the anisotropic charge distribution that goes along with orbital order gives rise to optical birefringence .",
    "in particular , the spectral weight of the mott gap excitations around 2 ev becomes anisotropic below 800 k @xcite .",
    "ellipsometric measurements revealed that this anisotropy increases strongly below the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature of @xmath12 k @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the optical spectra on the alignment of nearest - neighbor mn spins reveals that the lowest - energy excitations are intersite @xmath13 transitions .",
    "a quantitative description of the temperature dependence of the optical spectral weight could be achieved , based on the realization that the same fundamental mechanisms that determine the spectral weight of the optical excitations ( namely , the pauli principle and hund s rules ) also underlie the superexchange interaction parameters between mn spins that had been obtained independently by inelastic neutron scattering .    as ytio@xmath8 is isostructural to lamno@xmath8 , but possesses only a single valence @xmath10-electron , it is not unreasonable to expect that its optical properties are amenable to a description in the same framework .",
    "however , there are several important differences between both compounds .",
    "ytio@xmath8 is _ ferromagnetic _ below @xmath14 k @xcite and it is hence an uncommon example of an electrically insulating ferromagnet .",
    "moreover , ytio@xmath8 does not exhibit any structural phase transition below its chemical decomposition temperature of around 700 k @xcite .",
    "a cooperative jahn - teller effect akin to that in lamno@xmath8 is thus not apparent in its phase behavior .",
    "these differences are rooted in the microscopic properties of the orbitals occupied by the valence electrons .",
    "specifically , the @xmath10-electron of ytio@xmath8 occupies the @xmath9 manifold , which exhibits a higher degeneracy and weaker lattice coupling than the @xmath11 electron in lamno@xmath8 .",
    "the comprehensive optical spectroscopy study of carefully prepared single crystals of ytio@xmath8 reported here was designed to motivate and guide further theoretical work on the interplay between spin and charge correlations in the titanates .",
    "the experiments proved surprisingly difficult , because the optical spectra were found to depend strongly on the type of surface exposed to the beam . through extensive characterization measurements",
    ", this effect could be traced to an accumulation of oxygen defects near some ( but not all ) surfaces of the perovskite structure .",
    "special care has to be taken in order to maintain stoichiometry in the crystal volume probed by the beam .",
    "after these difficulties were overcome , the results revealed a situation that is strikingly different from that in lamno@xmath8 .",
    "notably , the optical spectrum depends only weakly on light polarization and on temperature , and the spectral weight rearrangement at the curie temperature is extremely small .",
    "a noticeable spectral weight rearrangement is , however , observed at about 100 k , far above the curie temperature .",
    "possible origins of this effect are discussed .",
    "single crystals of ytio@xmath8 were grown by the floating zone method in a reducing atmosphere ( ar / h@xmath15 = 50/50 ) .",
    "the starting material was prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of y@xmath15o@xmath8 ( 5n ) and ti@xmath15o@xmath8 ( 3n ) powders in ethanol ( 99.8% purity ) .",
    "note that commercially available y@xmath15o@xmath8 powders contain 0.6 - 0.8 wt.% of water .",
    "ignoring this during the feed rod preparation leads either to a deficiency of yttrium , or to titanium oxide impurities in the as - grown crystal .",

    "the rods were sintered at 1050@xmath18c for 12 h under the same vacuum conditions .",

    "equipped with four 1.5 kw halogen lamps . in the growth process",
    "the seed and feed shafts were rotated in opposite directions at rates of 10 - 15 rpm , the pulling rate was varied from 5 to 10 mm / h .",
    "the grown ingots were cut into wafers perpendicular to the growth direction , and both sides of wafers were polished to mirror finish . then polished specimens were characterized using a polarizing optical microscope to examine the presence of sub - grains and inclusions .",

    "the saturated moment , which we estimate in the easy direction at the highest magnetic field of 7 t is @xmath42 = 0.84 @xmath43 , whereas @xmath44 = 0.82 @xmath43 in the hard direction , both are reduced from one bohr magneton .",
    "the data are in good agreement with those reported by tsubota _",

    "for optical measurements the surfaces were polished to optical grade .",
    "the measurements in the frequency range of 4000 - 44000 @xmath45 ( 0.5 - 5.5 ev ) were performed with a home - built ellipsometer of rotating - analyzer type @xcite , where the angle of incidence is 70.0@xmath18 .",

    "ytio@xmath8 has an orthorhombic crystal structure ( space group _ pbnm _ , d@xmath47 ) with four formula units per unit cell ( see fig .",

    "5 we show low - temperature optical conductivity spectra in the phonon frequency range .",
    "the spectra were deduced from polarized reflectivity spectra via a standard kramers - kronig analysis , combined with the respective ellipsometry spectra for correct normalization .",
    "our polarized optical measurements allowed us to observe fully anisotropic phonon spectra in ytio@xmath8 single crystals and make an assignment of the infrared - active modes according to their symmetry . for * e * @xmath59 * a * we distinguish 9b@xmath53 normal modes at the frequencies 154 , 210 , 316 , 336 , 428 , 440 , 516 , 554 , and 577 @xmath45 , for * e * @xmath59 * b * we distinguish 9b@xmath60 normal modes at the frequencies 139 , 240 , 273 , 309 , 364 , 380 , 463 , 523 , and 578 @xmath45 , and for * e * @xmath59 * c * we distinguish 7b@xmath54 normal modes at the frequencies 165 , 203 , 322 , 349 , 386 , 543 , and 563 @xmath45 .",
    "our observation of fully polarized phonon spectra and its consistency with the symmetry analysis indicate good alignment of the crystal with respect to the crystallographic directions .",
    "further , the narrow and intense phonon peaks are testimony to the excellent quality of our ytio@xmath8 crystal .",
    "we have found out that polarized optical spectra in ytio@xmath8 exhibit specific features associated with the surface type exposed to the beam .",
    "figure 6 shows spectra of high - frequency , oxygen - dominated optical phonons measured with light polarized along the @xmath21-axis on different types of the surface associated with the @xmath61 and @xmath58 crystallographic planes .",
    "although the main features are observed at the same frequencies in both cases , a number of side - band modes are present in measurements on the @xmath61 surface . a similar set of extra modes",
    "is observed in @xmath20-axis polarized measurements on the @xmath61 surface , compared to the @xmath57 surface . as single crystals of ytio@xmath29",
    "easily accommodate extra oxygen , the appearance of the weaker satellites in the phonon spectra can be naturally explained as arising from the coupling with local oxygen modes , associated with oxygen interstitials , predominating in the @xmath61 surface .",
    "in addition , we show that the optical conductivity spectra close to the absorption edge are also dependent on the type of surface . in the inset of fig .",
    "7 one can see that the optical conductivity spectrum measured along the @xmath21-axis on the @xmath61 surface exhibits an optical band at about 0.8 ev , near the fundamental absorption edge . as a result , the absorption edge shifts to lower energies , compared to the @xmath58 surface .",
    "this may be an indication on the filling of the gap states with the energy levels associated with the defects predominating in the @xmath61 crystallographic plane .",
    "it is well known that the absorption within the optical gap in the rtio@xmath8 system is extremely sensitive to the oxygen stoichiometry @xcite .",
    "therefore , these data provide additional evidence for the presence of defects associated with oxygen interstitials in the @xmath61 surface , in agreement with the phonon spectra .    motivated by the optical data , we have performed surface - characterization measurements using auger - electron spectroscopy ( aes ) .",
    "figure 8 shows typical aes sputter - depth profiles obtained by ar@xmath62 bombardment of different ytio@xmath8 surfaces .",
    "one can see that the titanium concentration is almost flat in the sputter - depth profile , and independent of the type of surface studied .",
    "this is also the case for the oxygen profile measured on the @xmath58 surface of ytio@xmath8 crystals . on the contrary ,",
    "monitoring the oxygen concentration in the @xmath61 surface shows the profile significantly extended into the sample depth .",
    "we now discuss the origin of the differences in oxygen defect concentration near the different types of surfaces . ignoring the orthorhombic distortion for simplicity",
    ", we note that the @xmath58- and @xmath61-surfaces correspond ( 110 ) and ( 001 ) planes of the simple cubic perovskite structure , respectively ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the atomic stacking sequences of these planes are o@xmath15-ytio - o@xmath15-ytio- ... and yo - tio@xmath15-yo - tio@xmath15- ... , so that the valence states of the constituent ions imply that these surfaces are polar .",
    "polar surfaces are intrinsically unstable due to the macroscopic polarization caused by a dipole moment perpendicular to the surface generated by the alternating , oppositely charged planes @xcite . for the perovskite structure of lamno@xmath8",
    ", it has been shown by @xmath61-@xmath63 calculations @xcite that the polarity can be lifted in different ways for different types of surfaces .",
    "for instance , a redistribution of charge is able to cancel the macroscopic polarization near the ( 001 ) surface , whereas surface oxygen vacancies serve as a better stabilizing factor at the ( 110 ) surface .",
    "of course , these calculations can not be simply transposed to ytio@xmath8 , nonetheless , they indicate a possible microscopic origin of the differences in oxygen profiles and optical spectra revealed by our data .",
    "thus in the case of the @xmath61 surface ( associated with the ( 001 ) plane of the perovskite structure ) the charge redistribution could result in a formation of the defects comprising oxygen interstitials in the extended near - surface region .",
    "this could effect the infrared oxygen phonon modes and optical absorption edge in ytio@xmath8 crystal , in agreement with our observations .",
    "contrary to the @xmath61 surface , the perpendicular surfaces ( associated with the ( 110 ) plane of the perovskite structure ) could have predominantly surface defects . accordingly , we clearly see that the optical conductivity spectra measured on the surfaces including the @xmath22-axis show a dip at around 4.5 ev , as illustrated by fig .",
    "this effect is by far more pronounced in the optical conductivity spectra and appears at the uv frequencies , close to the onset of the strongly dipole - allowed @xmath6 transition .",
    "these observations show the importance of the surface effects , associated with screening of the surface charges by crystal defects and bond - bending phenomena at the surface , on the optical conductivity of ytio@xmath8 .",
    "therefore , one should refer the polarized optical conductivity spectra to the type of the surface measured .",
    "most of the measurements discussed below were taken on the @xmath58-surface , where no excess oxygen is detected .",
    "aging effects on the optical spectra of samples kept in air for extended periods of time are presumably also related to oxygen incorporation .",
    "nonequilibrium conditions at the crystal surface due to the ti@xmath26 @xmath27 ti@xmath28 instability in air are conducive to the formation of the titanium oxides , with the valency of ti increased above 3 + , and simultaneous incorporation of extra oxygen ( interstitials ) . due to",
    "the diffusion processes these defects migrate from the surface into the crystal bulk and form an extended profile . in fig . 7 , optical conductivity spectra in @xmath21-axis polarization on freshly polished @xmath61-surfaces",
    "are compared to identical data taken after about 1 - 1/2 years .",
    "the flat background , which sets on around 1.9 ev and extends to higher energies , decreases progressively with time .",
    "we show later on that the temperature evolution of the optical response measured on aged surfaces differs drastically from the temperature effects we associate with the bulk properties of stoichiometric ytio@xmath8 .",
    "figures 9 and 10 show the anisotropic real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function , @xmath64 = @xmath65 , and the optical conductivity @xmath66 at t = 300 k extracted from ellipsometric data .",
    "in contrast to prior data deduced from reflectivity measurements via kramers - kronig analysis @xcite we are able to resolve a noticeable anisotropy in the intensity of the @xmath61-plane and @xmath22-axis dielectric response . we can also distinguish a weak anisotropy within the @xmath61-plane . in agreement with prior work @xcite , our optical conductivity spectra exhibit a smooth onset of optical absorption around 0.5 ev ( fig .",
    "7 ) . due to the mott nature of the optical gap in ytio@xmath8 , formed between the lower and upper @xmath10 bands ,",
    "the fundamental absorption edge is supposed to exhibit @xmath13 character .",
    "however , the origin of the low - energy transitions in optical spectra of ytio@xmath8 has not been addressed in details so far . in our @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    "spectra one can clearly see a lowest - energy optical band peaking around 1.9 ev , whereas the following optical transitions are strongly superimposed , and the optical spectra look like featureless background for the highly intense band around 5.5 ev . to separate contributions from the different low - energy optical bands ,",
    "we perform a classical dispersion analysis .",
    "figure 11 summarizes results of a dispersion analysis of the complex dielectric response for @xmath21-axis polarization measured on @xmath61 plane at t = 300 k. using a dielectric function of the form @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are the peak energy , width , and dimensionless oscillator strength of the @xmath73th oscillator , and @xmath74 is the core contribution from the dielectric function , we fit a set of lorenzian oscillators simultaneously to @xmath75 and @xmath67 . in our analysis",

    "the three low - energy optical bands are located at 2.0 , 2.9 , and 3.7 ev in @xmath21-axis polarization at t = 300 k. an important value is the associated spectral weight ( sw ) , which can be estimated for the separate lorentz oscillator as @xmath76 = @xmath77 . in table 1",

    "recent work on lamno@xmath8 has shown that the temperature dependence of the optical spectral weight can be instrumental in tracking down the origin of the various features in the optical response @xcite .",
    "the spectral weight of the inter - site @xmath13 transitions is very sensitive to the temperature dependent spin correlations , because the spin alignment controls the transfer of electrons between neighboring sites via the pauli principle .",
    "the contribution from these transitions can thus be singled out by monitoring the evolution of the optical response through the onset of magnetic order , as demonstrated in lamno@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "figure 12 shows that the temperature effect on the optical spectra is weak in the temperature range from room temperature down to low temperatures .",
    "the main effects are a shift of the absorption edge to higher energies and a narrowing of the strong optical band at about 5.5 ev .",
    "our ellipsometric measurements also allowed us to resolve much weaker effects at low temperature , which one may associate with redistribution of optical spectral weight around the spin ordering temperature t@xmath31 = 30 k. figures 13a and b show difference in the dielectric function spectra , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , between 15 and 55  k , measured along the @xmath21- and @xmath22-axis , respectively .",

    "as discussed in section iii.d.2 above , the temperature dependence of the sw allows us to single out the contribution from intersite @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 charge excitations to the optical response .",
    "such transitions lead to four different excited states : a high - spin ( hs ) @xmath5 state at energy @xmath100 , two degenerate low - spin ( ls ) states @xmath101 and @xmath102 at energy @xmath103 , and a ls state @xmath104 at energy @xmath105 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath106 is the effective coulomb repulsion of the two electrons with opposite spins on the same @xmath9 orbital , and @xmath107 is the hund interaction .",
    "an ellipsometry study of the latio@xmath8 single crystal ( characterized in @xcite ) has revealed that all optical bands are shifted to lower energies by @xmath87 0.5 ev compared to ytio@xmath8 , presumably due to the screening effects .",
    "based on this observation and the estimated value of the effective on - site electron correlation energy @xmath108 @xmath87 4 ev in latio@xmath8 @xcite , we estimate @xmath106 @xmath87 4.5 ev in ytio@xmath8 .",
    "the hund s coupling constant is expected to be in the range 0.51 ev .",
    "( note that the free - ion value is 0.59 ev @xcite ) .",
    "the optical transition around 2.85 ev ( @xmath109  0.1  ev ) , which exhibits a sw increase in @xmath61 polarization at low temperatures , is therefore naturally assigned to a hs ( @xmath5 ) transition , where the valence electron is transferred to an unoccupied @xmath9 orbital on the neighboring ti site with a parallel spin . as the data are noisier at higher energies , the assignment of the band at 3.95 ev ( @xmath109  0.1  ev ) is more difficult . with this caveat ,",
    "it can be reasonably attributed to the lowest - lying ls transition , based on the observation of a sw decrease upon fm spin ordering . with the resulting tentative values of @xmath106 = 4.5 @xmath109  0.2  ev and @xmath107 = 0.55 ev @xmath109  0.1 ev",
    ", the next ls transition is expected at @xmath87 5.6 ev , at the high - energy limit of our optical measurements . in our earlier optical study of lamno@xmath8",
    "we identified a hs state of @xmath110 symmetry at the energy @xmath111 2.0 ev , where @xmath112 is the jahn - teller splitting energy of the @xmath11 levels @xcite . the estimated parameters @xmath113 2.8 ev , @xmath114 0.5 ev , and @xmath115 0.7 ev yielded a good description of the observed spectra .",
    "this suggests a lower value of energy for the hs state multiplet in lamno@xmath8 than in ytio@xmath8 . as the values of @xmath116 ( and @xmath107 )",
    "are supposed to follow certain semiempirical rules and are lower for early transition metal ions than for mn or ions with almost filled @xmath88 shells @xcite , there is a controversy regarding the estimated @xmath116 values in ytio@xmath8 and lamno@xmath8 .",
    "however , there is a good agreement between the @xmath116 values estimated for the ti oxides from photoemission spectra @xcite , @xmath9 resonant soft x - ray emission spectroscopy ( sxes ) @xcite , @xmath117 predictions @xcite , and from the present optical study . from this",
    "follows that environmental factors ( covalency , polarisation , etc . ) , which are important in many oxide systems @xcite , are essential to the understanding the electronic correlations in lamno@xmath8 , in particular , optical transitions and electronic photoinization spectra @xcite .",
    "this assignment suggests that the optical band at energy 2 ev ( figs .",
    "9 - 12 ) is dominated by transitions of different origins .",
    "one can see a noticeable shift of the absorption edge to higher energies with decreasing temperature in the left panel of fig .",
    "theories of band - tail absorption ascribe this behavior to electrons interacting with a spatially random potential due to thermal and structural disorder @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the absorption edge shifts in the opposite direction below about 100 k , which results in a sw gain below 1.5 ev ( see fig",
    ". 13 ( a ) and fig .",
    "it is possible that this effect could be associated with spin - polaronic ( or exciton - polaronic ) states in the band - tail density of states or with contributions from indirect @xmath13 optical transitions .",
    "in addition , as we have discussed above , weakly dipole - allowed @xmath6 transitions @xcite and intra - site ( cf ) @xmath13 transitions can contribute here .",
    "further experimental and theoretical studies are required to estimate different contributions to the optical band at energy 2 ev .",
    "we now focus on the absolute sw gain of the ( hs ) @xmath5-state @xmath13 transition centered around 2.85 ev due to @xmath118 - between the high - temperature limit ( ht ) - disordered spins - and the low - temperature limit ( lt ) - fm ordered spins , as well as the sw gain at low temperatures . via the optical sum rule in the tight - binding approximation",
    ", one finds @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the kinetic energy associated with virtual charge excitations .",
    "the contribution of the ( hs)@xmath5 excitation to the kinetic energy @xmath120 can be estimated from a related term in the superexchange energy , @xmath121 .",
    "for the bond along the @xmath122 direction , @xmath123 , where the orbital operators @xmath124 depend on the direction of the @xmath125 bond and @xmath126 is the electron transfer amplitude @xcite .",
    "provided the optical excitation energy of the hs - state at @xmath127 is specified , the optical spectral weight depends on the transfer amplitude @xmath126 and the underlying orbital state .",
    "we estimate the sw in the framework of the isotropic @xmath128-type classical orbital ordering , considered by ole _",
    "the kinetic energy of the hs - state at @xmath129 = 0 k is then expressed as @xmath130 = @xmath131 . at high temperatures ,",
    "spin disorder reduces this value by a factor of 1/4 . in the fm state",
    "the isotropic exchange constants are determined by @xmath132 = @xmath133 . using the experimental value of the exchange constant @xmath134 = @xmath1353 mev @xcite , and conservatively considering a wide range of hund coupling constants 0.5 ev @xmath136 1 ev",
    ", the transfer amplitude is estimated in the range 120 mev @xmath137 160 mev , in reasonable agreement with _",
    "ab - initio _",
    "calculations @xcite . the resulting estimate of the sw in the paramagnetic state , 0.022 @xmath138 0.034 , is a factor of 2 - 3 lower than the @xmath21-axis experimental value listed in table i. this estimate gives credence to our contention that inter - site @xmath13 transitions contribute substantially to the optical sw in this energy range .",
    "the same analysis yields a theoretical value of 0.008 @xmath139 ( lt , ht ) @xmath140 0.012 for the sw gain of the ( hs)@xmath5 transition due to @xmath118 .",
    "the experimental value in @xmath21-polarization is @xmath141(15k , 55k ) @xmath142 0.002 , due to a total contribution from the direct @xmath13 transitions at @xmath87 2.85 ev and the indirect @xmath13 transitions ( or spin - polaronic states ) at the absorption edge ( see fig .",
    "as the onset of the sw transfer is about 100 k , and the transfer is only about half complete at 55k , the difference between experimental and theoretical values is again about a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "the absence of any noticeable temperature - dependent sw change of the band at 2.85 ev along the @xmath22-axis ( fig .",
    "13b ) disagrees with the simple analysis presented above .",
    "one might be tempted to attribute this discrepancy to a strong anisotropy of the superexchange parameters predicted by various theoretical calculations @xcite . however , according to our optical data , the spectral weight of the low - energy optical bands along the @xmath22-axis is only a factor of 1.5 - 2 smaller than in the @xmath61-plane ( table i ) .",
    "moreover , a direct determination of the exchange parameters by inelastic neutron scattering is inconsistent with this prediction @xcite .    to summarize the discussion",
    ", we note that the overall magnitude of the sw of the optical band at 2.85 ev and its temperature dependence in @xmath61-polarization are in reasonable agreement with the predictions of a simple superexchange model , in analogy to lamno@xmath8 . however , the model overestimates the sw gain of the ( hs)@xmath5 transition due to @xmath118 by a factor of 2 - 3 .",
    "in addition , the anisotropic temperature dependence of the optical sw indicates that an understanding of the optical conductivity of ytio@xmath8 requires mechanisms that go qualitatively beyond this simple model .",
    "these observations can be naturally understood as a consequence of a possible ti @xmath9 orbital rearrangement between 55 k and 15 k. then , the lowering of the optical spectral weight and the anisotropy come through selection rules of the modified ground state wavefunction .    this may imply an important @xmath143 difference between lamno@xmath8 and ytio@xmath8 .",
    "almost undistorted tio@xmath144 octahedra in ytio@xmath8 indicate a small jahn - teller instability , resulting from the weak coupling between the two nearly - degenerate electronic ground states .",
    "the jahn - teller instability may disappear if there is sufficiently large splitting of the nearly - degenerate levels by some perturbation , in particular by the spin - orbit interactions @xcite .",
    "the orbital degrees of freedom may be essentially quenched in the magnetically ordered state , when the ground multiplet experiences splitting into two doublets , with concomitantly , a partial uncoupling of the spin and orbital moments .",
    "then the temperature behavior in such a system is largely determined by the interplay between the spin - orbit coupling and the jahn - teller effect .",
    "in addition , the joint spin - and - orbital fluctuations , which develop at finite temperatures , can contribute significantly at @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the establishment of the spin - spin correlations in approaching the magnetic transition will give rise to complex @xmath7 effects , peculiar to the systems with orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "by contrast , the orbital degrees of freedom are quenched in lamno@xmath8 by a large static jahn - teller distortion , and with the use of the same approach we have shown that the redistribution of the optical spectral weight is in a good agreement with a superexchange model that attributes these shifts to the temperature dependent correlations between mn spins @xcite .    finally , in fig .",
    "17 we show temperature dependence of the @xmath21-axis optical conductivity investigated on the aged surface of our ytio@xmath8 single crystal .",
    "in contrast to the temperature dependencies measured on freshly polished surfaces ( see fig .",
    "13 ) , a sizable temperature dependence is apparent in these spectra . with decreasing temperature , the optical sw is transferred from higher energies to the low - energy band around 1.9 ev .",
    "this temperature effect , measured on the aged surface of our ytio@xmath8 single crystal , is very similar to the observations recently reported by gssling _",
    "however , one can hardly ascribe this temperature effect to spin - spin correlations , because the temperature changes are observable over a wide temperature range from 300 k to 15 k , and the high - temperature changes are much more pronounced than those that might be associated with the onset of correlated spin fluctuations at low temperatures .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "7 shows that the optical conductivity spectra that exhibit a noticeable high - temperature effect , differ from those of measured on freshly polished surfaces . as discussed in section iii.c , we associate this phenomenon with the presence of defects of the titanium oxides , with the valency of ti increased above 3@xmath62 , and nearby extra oxygen ( interstitials ) in the near - surface layer",
    ". the observed redistribution of the sw may then be associated with localized states at the edge of the @xmath146 and @xmath10 electronic bands .",
    "the detailed ellipsometric study presented here shows that oxygen defects can strongly modify the optical response in the near - surface region probed by the light beam .",
    "extreme care must therefore be taken to maintain oxygen stoichiometry at the surface under investigation .",
    "the intrinsic optical response of ytio@xmath8 is broad , weakly anisotropic , and weakly temperature dependent . nonetheless , using a careful study of the temperature dependence in combination with a dispersion analysis",
    ", we were able to identify an optical band at 2.9 ev whose energy , absolute spectral weight , and temperature dependence is consistent with the intersite @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 hs - state ( @xmath5 ) optical transition .",
    "this indicates that @xmath13 transitions constitute a significant part of the optical response below the onset of dipole - allowed transitions between oxygen @xmath146- and titanium @xmath10-states at about 5 ev .",
    "however , this analysis accounts for only part of the optical response of ytio@xmath8 . in particular",
    ", the origin of an intense optical band around 2 ev remains unclear .",
    "this indicates that other mechanisms , such as weakly dipole - allowed @xmath6 transitions or spin - polaron ( or exciton - polaron ) excitations , can contribute here significantly to the optical spectra .",
    "a more elaborate approach is required to obtain a quantitative description and verify the assignment of this optical band .",
    "our experiments also uncovered an important _ qualitative _ difference between lamno@xmath8 and ytio@xmath8 . in lamno@xmath8 ,",
    "the spectral weight of inter - site @xmath13 transitions exhibits a strong anomaly upon heating above the nel temperature , followed by a more gradual temperature dependence due to short - range spin correlations at higher temperature . in ytio@xmath8 , the optical spectral",
    "weight evolves smoothly through the onset of magnetic long - range order , with no discernible anomaly at the curie temperature @xmath147 k. however , a distinct anomaly is observed at about 100 k , far above @xmath1 but coincident with a deviation of the uniform magnetization from mean - field curie - weiss behavior .",
    "this observation appears inconsistent with models in which the orbital degeneracy is completely quenched by lattice distortions , as it is in lamno@xmath8 , and gives credence to models that allow for a temperature - dependent orbital rearrangement .",
    "our data therefore underscore the role of ytio@xmath8 as an interesting model system for the complex interplay between spin , orbital , and lattice degrees of freedom .",
