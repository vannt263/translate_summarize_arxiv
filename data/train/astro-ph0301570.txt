    "the idea about the blobby accretion in magnetic cataclysmic variables had appeared as an attempt to explain the flickering and the soft x - ray excess in such systems . the fast variability at a time - scale of dozens of seconds is well described by the `` shot noise '' model with an exponential decay of its auto - correlation function ( acf , andronov 1994 ) .",
    "the `` shot noise '' is interpreted as a result of accretion of large diamagnetic blobs ( beardmore & osborne 1997 ; kuijpers & pringle 1982 ; panek 1980 ) .",
    "the drag coefficient @xmath1 is dependent on such parameters , as the magnetic field strength @xmath2 , blob size @xmath3 , blob mass @xmath4 and alfvn velocity in interblob plasma @xmath5 .",
    "because the alfvn velocity and the mass of the blob are expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the densities of the blob and interblob plasma in the flow , respectively , the drag coefficient is expressed as @xmath9 in the models of accretion , the dipolar field configuration is usually assumed , although , it is not a precise approach .",
    "possible differences between the blob parameters , such as mass and size ( wynn & king 1995 ) , could lead the differences in locations of the active regions on the white dwarf surface and in the variability of the shot noise decay time .",
    "if we calculate the blob trajectories with the range of sizes between @xmath10 to @xmath11 cm , then in the case of hu  aqr , we can obtain the next ideal dependence of the initial blob size on the azimuth on white dwarf surface ( fig.1 ) .",
    "having such a clear picture of distribution of the blob sizes at the white dwarf surface , we can expect the smooth variability of the shot noise decay time .",
    "if we remove the orbital variability from our observations , we can calculate the biased acf and , using the method described by andronov ( 1994 ) , we can calculate the exponential decay time for unbiased acf .    during the fall onto the white dwarf s surface ,",
    "the blobs are deformed owed to tidal forces",
    ". the undisturbed size of a blob is expressed by halevin et al.(2002b ) as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the coupling distance and @xmath14 is a mass of the white dwarf .",
    "one can see that the falling time of the blobs does not depend on the stopping height .      to make more realistic model of blobby accretion in polars",
    ", we have used the sph method .",
    "the pure hydrodynamical model was made by cach & howell ( 2002 ) .",
    "dynamical positions of the flow points at the doppler tomogram is shown in fig.3 .    in our model ,",
    "we have used the hydrodynamical parameters of the flow to make comparison between the gas pressure ( not the ram one ) and the magnetic pressure . when the magnetic pressure becomes larger than the gas pressure , we convert our sph points into blobs .    here",
    "we used computed from our model parameters of the flow with the formula of hameury , king , & lasota ( 1986 ) for the minimum scale of the structures which are unstable to the rayleigh - taylor mechanism @xmath15 where @xmath16 is magnetic field and @xmath17 is the distance of blob appearance . substituting ( 6 ) to the ( 4 ) , we obtain the expression for the drag force in the next form : @xmath18 the very interesting result is that , under such assumptions , the drag force does not depend neither on the blob sizes nor on the blob density , but only on the magnetic field and the interblob plasma density , which we assumed to be a constant .",
    "first of all , one can see that this model can not explain the observed accretion curtain features .",
    "it will be possible , if we take into account the disruption of the blobs by the kelvin - helmholtz instability . in the next fig.5",
    ", one can see the distribution of the accretion blob sizes on the white dwarf surface for the case of am  her .",
    "there is already no strong dependence .",
    "however , possible effect is that large blobs can originate in outer parts of the accretion stream , and , hence , they will fall into outer parts of the active region on white dwarf surface .",
    "take a look at the size distribution ( fig.5 ) . because the sizes of the blobs are in inverse proportion with the blob density and the density is inversely proportional to the shock height",
    ", we can expect that this distribution is about to express also the shock height .",
    "such distribution of the shock heights could explain the observed double humped orbital soft x - ray variability of am  her ( christian 2000 ) as absorption by higher shocks .    under our assumptions ,",
    "larger blobs have smaller densities . as we know from the work of fisher & beuermann ( 2001 ) , for larger accretion rate per unit area ,",
    "the maximum of cyclotron radiation shifts to the shorter wavelengths .",
    "so we can expect , that in blue wavelengths we can observe accretion of the shorter blobs , that has been already discovered by beardmore & osborne ( 1997 ) .",
    "so , let me show the final results of investigations of the shot noise decay time in magnetic cataclysmic variables ( table 1 ) . for am  her and ef  eri",
    ", we have analysed the x - ray variability and detected the mean decay times of about 70 s.        from optical observations in v and r band for by  cam and qq  vul , the systems with higher magnetic fields , the decay time is smaller . for ar  uma",
    ", we could not find the shot noise because the system was in its low state .",
    "but it can be the consequence of the high magnetic field and the full disruption of the blobs by the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "so , the main our future perspectives are : + @xmath20advanced models with kelvin - helmholtz disruption .",
    "+ @xmath20investigations of the shot noise behavior in soft x - rays .",
    "+ @xmath20investigations of the systems with different magnetic fields , especially high - field polars .",
    "+ @xmath20analysis of the long term behavior of the shot noise parameters ."
