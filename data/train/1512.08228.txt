    "a key to decipher the dynamical formation of the galaxy is a population study in the representative galactic components : galactic center , disk , and the bulge .",
    "the galactic bulge is an old ( @xmath13  gyr ) spheroidal rotator with an angular size of @xmath14 , where massive stars are considered to have ended up to compact objects such as black holes or neutron stars .",
    "since these objects produce enormous amounts of x - rays ( @xmath15  erg  s@xmath11 ) via the accretion process , hence , the luminosity function of luminous x - ray sources provides indirect information on the distribution of primordial high - mass stars in the galactic bulge .",
    "because of its proximity , deep investigations in some intriguing regions were devoted to revolve spatially x - ray sources down to the x - ray fluxes of several times @xmath16  erg  s@xmath11  @xmath6 ( e.g. , galactic bulge survey ; @xcite ) , which have never been achieved in the extragalactic survey  erg  s@xmath11  @xmath6 corresponds to the x - ray luminosity of @xmath17  erg  s@xmath11 at a distance of @xmath18  kpc , which is @xmath19 orders of magnitude smaller than the sensitivity limit of the chandra survey of the m31 bulge ( @xmath20  erg  s@xmath11 ; ) ] .",
    "however , once we focus on moderately bright x - ray sources in the galactic bulge , which fluxes of @xmath21  erg  s@xmath11  @xmath6 correspond to the x - ray luminosity of @xmath22  erg  s@xmath11 at @xmath18  kpc , the low space density of these sources requires comprehensive mapping observations with wide - field coverage and relatively long exposures .",
    "this motivates us to develop an approach to pick up the discrete x - ray sources in the galactic bulge from the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) data .",
    "using the x - ray color provided in the rass bright source catalogue ( rbsc ; ) , we made a flux - limited sample of 68 sources towards the galactic bulge ; the nature of about half of these rbsc sources remains unclear . in order to improve the completeness of the galactic bulge x - ray sources and to construct the luminosity functions of different populations in the galactic bulge",
    ", we now proceed a campaign of x - ray follow - up observations for spectroscopic identification to the unidentified x - ray sources .",
    "a total of 21 rbsc sources has been observed so far with suzaku ( 5 ) , xmm - newton ( 5 ) , and chandra ( 11 ) . on the basis of these follow - up observations ,",
    "3 low - mass x - ray binaries ( , , @xcite ) , 1 rs cvn star @xcite , and 1 cluster of galaxies @xcite were identified .    in this paper , we report the results of two unidentified x - ray sources obtained with the xmm - newton and suzaku observations ; these two sources turned out most likely to be foreground stars .",
    "although these sources are unlikely to be the galactic bulge population , these stars are available for understanding the x - ray population in the galactic disk ; our result may provide a clue to resolve the enhanced soft x - ray emission below @xmath23  kev , so - called `` m - band problem '' ( e.g. , ) , or the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ; @xcite ) .",
    "we describe the observation and data reduction in section  [ section : observation ] .",
    "the analysis of the x - ray images and spectra as well as their results are given in section  [ section : analysis ] .",

    "the x - ray luminosity in the @xmath1@xmath2  kev is @xmath206  erg  s@xmath11 , where @xmath207 represents the source distance in unit of @xmath205  pc .",
    "this x - ray luminosity is comparable to that of fast rotating g giants , e.g. , fk comae ( g5iii , ) or @xmath208 ceti ( g9.5iii , ) , which luminosities were found to be @xmath209@xmath210  erg  s@xmath11 in the @xmath1@xmath29  kev band and @xmath211@xmath212  erg  s@xmath11 in the @xmath48@xmath213  kev band , respectively .    to elucidate plasma structures in stellar coronae , the distribution of the emission measures ( ems ) given as a function of temperature ( @xmath101 ) has been extensively examined with high - resolution spectroscopic studies using grating modules ( e.g. , , @xcite , , @xcite , @xcite )",
    "however , the x - ray spectra with moderate energy resolution for fk comae and @xmath208 ceti are known to be well reproduced with a two - temperature plasma model , similar to that for 1rxs j180556.1@xmath0343818 .",
    "the temperatures were @xmath80 and @xmath214  kev for fk comae during its low flux phase , and @xmath215 and @xmath97  kev for @xmath208 ceti . the lower - temperature plasma with @xmath216  kev of 1rxs j180556.1@xmath0343818 probably reflects a solar - type active region , which corresponds to a peak at @xmath217 of the em distribution for g - type stars .",
    "the temperature of the hot plasma ( @xmath218  kev ) of 1rxs j180556.1@xmath0343818 was an intermediate value compared with those of @xmath208 ceti and fk comae .",
    "as a possible origin of these hot components with @xmath219  kev , a continuous flaring activity is suggested ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is still an open issue what are the main physical conditions that determine x - ray flaring activities of late - type giants .",
    "however , we note that such flaring activities may be somewhat related to the stellar rotation .",
    "@xcite indeed pointed out the correlation between the x - ray luminosity and the projected rotational velocity ( @xmath220 ) for late - type stars . reported that the rotational velocity of hd 321269 was @xmath221  km  s@xmath11 , while the rotational velocities of fk comae and @xmath208 ceti were known to be @xmath222  km  s@xmath11 and @xmath223  km  s@xmath11 , respectively",
    "the elemental abundances of 1rxs j180556.1@xmath0343818 were found to be depleted for fe .",
    "regardless of the abundance tables and plasma codes  kev .",
    "see also http://www.atomdb.org/issues/fe_lambda_atomdb_spex.pdf ] we used for the spectral fit , the fe abundance was significantly lower than those of the other elements . while o and ne have first ionization potentials ( fips ) higher than @xmath29  ev , the fip of fe is @xmath224  ev .",
    "thus , the abundance pattern in the 1rxs j180556.1@xmath0343818 spectra may reflect differences of the fips .",
    "a similar abundance pattern was reported for hr 1099 , in which low - fip elements are suppressed , compared with high - fip ones .",
    "diffusive processes involved with magnetic fields could operate elemental segregation in the corona that leads to such an fip effect . in terms of the presence of a layer with an excess of high - fip elements , @xcite explained the ne and s enrichment in the flaring solar plasma .",
    "although hr 1099 is an rs cvn binary , the rotational velocity of hr1099 was obtained to be @xmath225  km  s@xmath11 @xcite , comparable to that of hd 321269 .",
    "thus , the rotational velocity of the system may be a factor to influence the abundance pattern in the coronal plasma .      in the suzaku observation of 1rxs j173905.2@xmath0392615 , we found faint x - ray emission , designated as suzaku j1739@xmath03926 , in the center of the xis field of view .",
    "judging from the radial profile of the surface brightness , the x - ray emission probably originated from a single point source .",
    "the source position was given to be @xmath157 , indicated with a red plus of figure  [ fig:1rxsj173905_zoomup_image ] .",
    "however , the exact position of the rbsc source ( magenta plus in figure  [ fig:1rxsj173905_zoomup_image ] ) was located @xmath226 away in the south - eastern direction from suzaku j1739@xmath03926 . the positional accuracy of suzaku j1739@xmath03926",
    "was estimated to be @xmath227 , taking into account the absolute pointing error in the suzaku observation , as is shown by a red dashed circle in figure  [ fig:1rxsj173905_zoomup_image ] .",
    "this circular region overlapped with an error circle that represents a typical positional accuracy of the rbsc sources ( @xmath228 for the 90% confidence limit , ) .",
    "hence , we concluded that suzaku j1739@xmath03926 was consistent with 1rxs j173905.2@xmath0392615 .",
    "( 80mm,50mm)fig5.eps    we note that @xmath29 near - infrared ( nir ) sources , which are listed in the 2mass second incremental release point source catalogue @xcite , are positionally coincident with suzaku j1739@xmath03926 .",
    "since no further information was available for a unique determination of the optical counterpart , hereafter , we only discuss the possibilities of the counterpart for two relatively bright ( with apparent @xmath229-band magnitude of @xmath230  mag ) sources : 2mass j1739035@xmath0392545 and 2mass j1739040@xmath0392609 .",
    "2mass j1739035@xmath0392545 is also identified with tyc 7888 - 111 - 1 and hd 323934 on the basis of the positional agreement .",
    "the source location of 2mass j1739035@xmath0392545 was @xmath231 away from the best - fit position of suzaku j1739@xmath03926 in the north - eastern direction ( blue plus in figure  [ fig:1rxsj173905_zoomup_image ] ) .",
    "the @xmath195 and @xmath196-band magnitudes of tyc 7888 - 111 - 1 were known to be @xmath232  mag and @xmath233  mag , respectively , and then the spectral type of hd 323934/tyc 7888 - 111 - 1 was inferred to be a2 . however , an unambiguous stellar classification is difficult ; @xcite recently derived the spectral type of f0ii to hd 323934/tyc 7888 - 111 - 1 by fitting a compilation of photometric data .",
    "if 2mass j1739035@xmath0392545/hd 323934/tyc 7888 - 111 - 1 is indeed an a - type star , we can estimate the luminosity distance as follows . assuming the upper limit of the absorption column density to be @xmath234  @xmath6 , the interstellar extinction in the @xmath196-band was estimated to be at most @xmath235  mag [ @xmath236 . while the apparent @xmath196-band magnitude was @xmath237  mag ,",
    "the absolute magnitude of a2 main sequence stars is @xmath238  mag .",
    "hence , the luminosity distance was estimated to be @xmath222  pc .",
    "we thus deduced the x - ray luminosity in the @xmath3@xmath9  kev band of @xmath239  erg  s@xmath11 .",
    "it is well known that a or f - type stars , e.g. , altair and hr 8799 , are faint x - ray sources with @xmath240  erg  s@xmath11 and seldom show intense x - ray flares , as is explained by weak magnetic activity and stellar winds .",
    "indeed , altair and hr 8799 are stable in x - rays during the decades . however , assuming that the x - ray source is indeed 1rxs j173905.2@xmath0392615 and that the rosat spectrum is reproduced with the best - fit optically - thin thermal plasma model described in section  [ subsection:1rxsj173905 ] , the source shows the flux drop from @xmath241 to @xmath242  erg  s@xmath11  @xmath6 .",
    "hence , the x - ray emission may not be attributed to 2mass j1739035@xmath0392545 . a possible scenario to explain",
    "this x - ray variability is that a hidden late - type companion of 2mass j1739035@xmath0392545 emits soft x - rays , similar to hd 161084 @xcite , and that the companion was in an x - ray flaring phase during the rosat observation .",
    "2mass j1739040@xmath0392609 is located @xmath243 away from the suzaku j1739@xmath03926 position in the south - eastern direction ( another blue plus in figure  [ fig:1rxsj173905_zoomup_image ] ) .",
    "the @xmath229 , @xmath244 , and @xmath245-band magnitudes of the source were @xmath246 , @xmath247 , and @xmath248  mag , respectively .",

    "thus , the intrinsic color index of 2mass j1739040@xmath0392609 was estimated to be @xmath256@xmath79  mag and @xmath257@xmath48  mag . according to table 3 of @xcite",
    ", the combination of the color indices corresponds to main sequence stars with a spectral type of f  k . assuming an f5v star with an absolute magnitude of @xmath258  mag @xcite , the luminosity distance of 2mass j1739040@xmath0392609 is derived to be @xmath259  pc , and",
