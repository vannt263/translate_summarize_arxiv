    "the recent cosmological observations , such as those from type ia supernovae  @xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation  @xcite , large scale structure  @xcite and weak lensing  @xcite , reveal that our universe is subject to a period of acceleration .",
    "in general , there are two ways to explain the phenomenon of the late - time accelerating universe  @xcite either by modifying the left- and right - handed sides of einstein equation , called modified gravity and modified matter theories , respectively . for modified gravity theories ,",
    "the acceleration is accounted as a part of the gravitational effect , while modified matter theories are constructed by including some negative pressure matter that could result in the expanding effect . in this study , we adopt the view point of an alternative gravity theory by selecting so - called poincar gauge theory ( pgt )  @xcite , which is also suitable to describe the late - time accelerating behavior  @xcite .",
    "pgt is under the consideration of gauging poincar group @xmath7 for gravity , and it sets out from a riemann - cartan spacetime @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a differentiable manifold , @xmath10 is a metric on @xmath9 , and @xmath11 is a general affine metric - compatible connection with @xmath12 so that it has a canonical decomposition into @xmath13 with @xmath14 the riemannian part and @xmath15 the contortion tensor written in terms of the torsion tensor @xmath16 of @xmath11 . as a result , pgt is in general a theory of gravitation  @xcite with torsion , which couples to the spin source .",
    "the theory comprises a degenerate case of the einstein s general relativity ( gr ) of the vanishing torsion @xmath16 and the einstein - cartan theory  @xcite with a torsion field equation ( tfe ) algebraically coupled to the intrinsic spin of the source , resulting in a non - dynamical torsion field . in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on a specific quadratic theory with only the scalar - torsion mode in pgt , which possesses the dynamical torsion field .",
    "this particular mode is the _",
    "simple @xmath0 mode _",
    ", which is one of the six modes : @xmath17 and @xmath18 labeled by spin and parity , based on the linearized theory  @xcite .",
    "we remark that the @xmath19 mode interacts with intrinsic spins of fermions  @xcite .",
    "however , its contribution is considered to have largely diminished from the early universe to the present time so that its effect in the current stage must be slight . on the other hand",
    ", since the @xmath0 mode has no interaction with any fundamental source  @xcite , one could imagine that it remains to have a considerable portion within the current universe .",
    "consequently , this mode naturally becomes the subject to study  @xcite .    in view of the flrw cosmology ,",
    "the vanishing spin current of the scalar - torsion mode renders a set of nonlinear equations which address the evolutions of the metric and torsion field . under the positivity energy argument ,",
    "shie , nester and yo ( sny ) in  @xcite have observed two separate cases : one has a constant affine curvature ( @xmath20 const ) which violates the positive energy condition ; and the other subject to the condition forms a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( odes ) . in the former",
    ", it has a late time de sitter space asymptote  @xcite yet the torsion energy density could be negative , and the equation of state ( eos ) of the torsion field has an interesting behavior  @xcite . in the latter , no obvious analytic solution is found so that numerical methods are generally applied . in particular ,",
    "one of interesting features in our previous study  @xcite for the latter case is that the torsion eos has an asymptotic behavior in the high redshift regime , whereas some other studies in the literature  @xcite point out that the affine curvature @xmath21 , torsion scalar @xmath22 and hubble parameter @xmath23 are oscillatory during the cosmological evolution .",
    "since the oscillating behaviors do not appear in our work  @xcite , a thorough study is clearly needed . in this paper",
    ", we find a proof from a semi - analytical solution in the large curvature regime to support our non - oscillatory result . in order to demonstrate the conformity with our semi - analytical solution",
    ", we will also present the numerical analysis .",
    "in this note , we explore a specific scalar - torsion mode in pgt called the _ simple @xmath0 mode _ , given by  @xcite @xmath24 with the positive coefficients of @xmath25 and @xmath26 are required by the positivity energy argument . under the flrw metric",
    ", the field equations have been shown in eqs .",
    "( 2.11)-(2.13 ) in ref .",
    "the friedmann equations for the scalar - torsion mode are given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 in gr , the subscript @xmath9 represents the ordinary matter including both dust @xmath29 and radiation @xmath30 , and @xmath1 and @xmath31 correspond to the torsion density and pressure of the effective geometric effect other than gr , defined as @xmath32 respectively . from ( [ e : rho , p_t ] ) , we can discuss the torsion eos , @xmath33 , defined by  @xcite @xmath34      in this context , we provide the semi - analytical solution of the positive energy scalar - torsion mode in the large scalar affine curvature limit @xmath35 which is commonly achieved in the high redshift regime @xmath36 .",
    "in such situation , we write the energy density of ordinary matter and torsion in series expansion of @xmath37 as @xmath38 respectively .    before the analysis",
    ", we first follow the rescaling of the parameters in  @xcite , @xmath39 where @xmath40 . the equations of motion  @xcite can be rewritten as dimensionless equations : @xmath41 respectively , where @xmath42 .",
    "in ( [ e : main eq3-n / dim ] ) , we have taken the approximation of @xmath35 for the high redshift regime . with the above rescaling",
    ", we shall argue that the lowest order of @xmath1 does not exceed @xmath2 in the following discussion .",
    "we formulate the statement as a theorem .    in the high redshift regime @xmath36 , @xmath43 .",
    "first we expand @xmath44 where @xmath45 is some integer , so that we have @xmath46 using ( [ e : main eq1-n / dim ] ) , ( [ e : main eq3-n / dim ] ) , ( [ e : h^2 ] ) and ( [ e : dh ] ) , we obtain @xmath47 substituting ( [ e : h^2 ] ) , ( [ e : dh ] ) , ( [ e : tilde_r ] ) and ( [ e : tilde_phi ] ) into ( [ e : main eq2-n / dim ] ) , and comparing the lowest power ( requiring @xmath48 , otherwise losing its leading position ) of @xmath3 in the high redshift , @xmath49 , we derive the following relation @xmath50 = 0,\\ ] ] which leads to @xmath51 if @xmath52 as @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "this is equivalent to say that ( [ e : h^2 ] ) has the form @xmath55    finally , we achieve our claim from ( [ e : h2 ] ) that @xmath56 note that the last equality follows since @xmath57 , which will be explained later .",
    "this is the end of the proof .",
    "we now write the expansion in ( [ e : rho_t ] ) , by the theorem above , simply as @xmath58 we shall only take first few dominating terms for a sufficient demonstration . by the procedure in the proof of the theorem , we can as well compare terms of various orders to yield the following relations , @xmath59 = 0,\\\\ \\label{eq : sol_pow5 } o(a^{-8 } ) & : &   \\left ( 1 + \\frac{\\tilde{a}_1}{\\tilde{\\mu } } a_3 \\right )   \\left [ 4 \\frac{\\tilde{a}_0}{\\tilde{\\mu } } \\left ( 1 + 3 \\frac{\\tilde{a}_1}{\\tilde{\\mu } } a_3 \\right ) a_2 \\right . \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.- \\left ( 3 a_2 + \\frac{\\tilde{a}_1}{\\tilde{\\mu } } \\left ( a_2 \\left ( 2 + 5 a_3 \\right ) -18",

    "however , due to the observational data that @xmath64 at the current stage , the radiation density is much smaller than the dust density ( @xmath65 ) , whereas the torsion density is the same order as the dust density , as seen from ( [ e : rho_t ] ) , @xmath66 - ( 1 + |r_1| ) \\simeq o(1)\\,.\\ ] ] subsequently , we have that @xmath67 \\leq \\max\\ { o(1 ) , o(|r_1| ) \\}$ ] , along with the assumption @xmath68 for each @xmath69 . as a result , we conclude that @xmath70 , for all @xmath71 , should not be too large , which forbids the possibility @xmath72 .",
    "this argument shows the validity of the last equality in ( [ e : rho_t ] ) with the non - vanishing @xmath73 coefficient .    from ( [ e : w_t ] ) , via the continuity equation  @xcite , we obtain @xmath74 where the prime @xmath75 stands for @xmath76 and we have used ( [ eq : rho_t ] ) for @xmath49 .      in this subsection",
