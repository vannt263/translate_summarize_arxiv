    "<S> the time to dissolve the intermediate hill containing the @xmath1-cluster grows exponentially with the size of the @xmath1-cluster , and hence the final sps state is reached over a time - scale @xmath45 . by contrast , in the fps and ips ( @xmath46 ) phases , the landscape is organized differently , and this leads to fast relaxation , with times growing as @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the part of the landscape beneath the intervening @xmath1 cluster either shows symmetric fluctuations ( for @xmath28 ) or gets pushed downward ( for @xmath20 ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : rel ] shows the scaling collapse of the equal time density correlation function for @xmath0 particles when separations are scaled by the coarsening length scale @xmath48 , which is found to grow as @xmath49 . in ips phase ( @xmath28 ) we find @xmath50 in both one and two dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the fps phase ( @xmath17 ) shows @xmath51 in one dimension for very large @xmath6 and @xmath38 while for smaller values of these variables , our data show finite size effects ( see @xcite for details ) . in two dimensions for fps , we measured @xmath52 , for the largest values of @xmath6 and @xmath38 we could access . </S>",
    "<S> our plots in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rel ] constitute the first observation of algebraic coarsening for completely phase separated systems , and stand in strong contrast to the ultraslow logarithmic coarsening observed in the lr and abc models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> underlying the speed - up of the coarsening process is a simple mechanism , namely the formation of disordered segments of the landscape between ordered clusters . </S>",
    "<S> these segments generate fluctuations which allow mergers of ordered regions to occur on a rapid time scale .     </S>",
    "<S> shows a collapse when @xmath53 is scaled by @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) and ( c ) show scaled data for @xmath55 in one and two dimensions , respectively . here </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) and ( d ) show similar plots for @xmath56 . here , in one dimension , @xmath51 and in two dimensions @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> we have used @xmath57(a ) , @xmath58(b ) and @xmath59((c ) and ( d ) ) here . ]    to summarize , we have considered coupled driven systems consisting of two species of particles being advected by an energy landscape whose dynamics is in turn influenced by the particles . </S>",
    "<S> the differential interaction between the landscape and the two particle species gives rise to different phases in the system as the interaction parameters are varied . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated the occurrence of new phases with fast dynamics , where both the particles and the landscape show long range order and the composite system is in a nonequilibrium current - carrying state .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with a discussion of the implications of our work for modeling in biophysical contexts . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that on the cell membrane , various proteins and lipids like integrins , t - cell receptors are present in the form of nano - clusters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this clustering is shown to be induced by the cortical actin cytoskeleton @xcite , and within a recent theoretical model of the process , an fdpo state has been observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is now experimental evidence that the actin cytoskeleton also gets reorganized by these membrane components @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this raises the interesting possibility of new phases arising if the treatment of @xcite is extended to account for the back action of membrane components on the cytoskeleton .    </S>",
