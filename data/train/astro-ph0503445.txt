    "debris disks around main - sequence stars are dusty , optically thin , and gas - poor .",
    "radiation pressure ( rp ) and poynting - robertson ( pr ) drag eliminate dust grains on timescales shorter than the stellar age , so the observed dust must be continuously replenished by collisions among , or evaporation of , planetesimals @xcite . the _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) _ and the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ revealed over 100 stars with far - infrared excesses indicating the presence of debris disks .",
    "however , spatially resolved images of these disks are relatively rare : only about a dozen debris disks have been resolved since the early 1980s ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the resolved disks are not featureless .",
    "they frequently display warps , spiral structures , and other azimuthal and radial asymmetries .",
    "different mechanisms have been suggested to explain these features .",
    "they may be caused by interactions between the dust and the gas in the disk ( @xcite , hereafter ta01 ) , the formation of small planets ( @xcite ) , the dynamical forces of embedded planets ( @xcite ) , or stellar - mass companions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "whatever their cause(s ) , the features observed in the dust disks provide insight into the characteristics of the unseen planetesimal population and illuminate the dynamical processes of young planetary systems .",
    "hd  141569a ( a0  v ; age 5@xmath63 myr , @xcite ) has a resolved circumstellar debris disk .",
    "its _ hipparcos _ distance is 99  pc from the sun and has co - moving m2  v and m4  v companions separated by 1.4  and located at distances of 755 and 893 , respectively ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the disk was first resolved in scattered light by @xcite and @xcite using the _ hubble space telescope s ( hst s ) _ near - infrared camera multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) .",
    "@xcite imaged the disk with _",
    "hst s _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) and noticed strong brightness asymmetries .",
    "these observations have recently been complemented by images from _",
    "hst s _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) ( @xcite , hereafter c03 ) .",
    "together , these scattered - light images reveal very complex structure , including an inner clearing within 175  au of the star , a bright spiral `` ring '' with a sharp inner edge from 175 to 215  au , a faint zone from 215 to 300  au , and a broad spiral `` ring '' from 300 to 400  au ( c03 ) .",
    "these distances are measured along the projected disk s southern semimajor axis .",
    "( for convenience , we will hereafter refer to the two tightly - wound spiral rings simply as `` rings . '' ) c03 also observed two low - intensity , large - scale spiral arms in the outermost part of the disk , that they attributed to tidal interaction with the m dwarf companions .",
    "the influence of the m dwarf companions on the disk s morphology was first discussed by @xcite .",
    "they argued that if all three stars were coplanar with the disk , the system would not be stable .",
    "given its young age , however , the system may be bound . with this assumption",
    ", @xcite concluded that resonant interactions between the companions and the disk do not account for the disk structure . assuming that the companions revolve around the primary star in a highly eccentric orbit , @xcite constructed dynamical models of the optical disk comprising dust grains that respond to the stellar gravitational field .",
    "they assumed that the grains are large enough that rp , pr drag , and gas drag are unimportant .",
    "they also ignored the presence of the large - scale spiral arms reported by c03 .",
    "their model reproduces the general appearance of the brightness asymmetries observed in the disk .",
    "@xcite constructed hydrodynamic models of hd  141569a s gas disk without dust , and concluded also that the companions lie in an eccentric orbit .",
    "their models reproduced the large - scale spiral arms ( even after several periastron passages ) and some other disk asymmetries .",
    "ta01 modeled the interaction between disks of gas and intermediately - sized ( @xmath7 m ) dust grains , and @xcite considered disks with very small particles .",
    "it is not clear that the conditions explored by any of these models is the correct one for the scattered light images of the disk around hd  141569a . in  [ obscons ] , we argue that submicron - sized grains account for most of the scattering opacity at optical wavelengths .",
    "such small grains are subject to rp which quickly expels them from the disk .",
    "the gas detected in the disk @xcite tempers somewhat the short `` blow out '' timescales , but its mass is not enough to dominate the dynamics of the dust (  [ conf ] ) . in this paper , we explore the effects of strong rp , gas drag , and gravity on small dust grains , using hd  141569a s disk as a benchmark .",
    "we simultaneously track the behavior of three different populations ",
    "the unseen planetesimals controlled by gravity , the gas controlled by gravity and volumetric fluid forces , and the dust controlled by gravity , rp , and gas drag . the insights obtained from this analysis should be applicable to other systems where rp is important .    in  [ obscons ] , we review the observational constraints that every model of the system should satisfy .",
    "we consider evidence that indicates the dominance of submicron - sized grains and we set limits on the amount of gas in the disk . in  [ conf ]",
    ", we explore the interaction between gas and dust by means of a one - dimensional model .",
    "we show that the gas slows the outward motion of the dust and can produce broad ring - like structures . in  [ model ] , we present two - dimensional dynamical simulations of the interactions between planetesimals , dust grains , gas , and the three stars . assuming that the two m dwarf companions are co - moving but unbound , we find that a recent parabolic fly - by causes some of the observed disk structure , including the large - scale arms . however , our models produce a more disorganized disk than is observed .",
    "we argue that the central hole in the disk can be produced by a planet with a mass a few times that of jupiter ( or , alternatively , some number of smaller planets ) in a highly eccentric orbit about the primary star .",
    "figure [ profiles ] shows the optical depth profile of the disk , taken from figure 5 of c03 .",
    "this profile represents the median values of concentric annuli centered on the primary star .",
    "drawn from a composite of f435w ( acs @xmath8 band ) and f606w ( acs broad-@xmath9 band ) images , it is roughly indicative of the optical characteristics of the disk at @xmath10 m .",
    "power - law fits to the inner and outer edges of the profile ( using as errors the standard deviation at every radius ) give @xmath11 for @xmath12  au and @xmath13 for @xmath14  au . beyond 500  au",

    "see @xcite ) .",
    "the disk is occulted by acs s coronagraphic mask within @xmath21  au . @xcite and @xcite detected mid - infrared thermal emission within this radius and @xcite concluded that the optical depth at @xmath22 m decreases by a factor of @xmath23 within this region .",
    "* hereafter ll03 ) modeled the thermal spectrum of the disk by assuming a density profile similar to the one shown in figure [ profiles ] .",
    "their model suggests that the reduced emission within @xmath24150  au is due to reduced dust density and not a change in the scattering properties of the grains .",
    "c03 reported that the disk is redder than the star , with color excesses of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "they also reported no color variation as a function of distance from the star ( which supports our use of a constant opacity in the mass calculation above ) .",
    "c03 inferred that the disk s colors are consistent with astronomical - silicate grains having a size distribution of @xmath27 and a minimum radius of @xmath28 m .",
    "@xcite used the same color information to derive lower size limits between @xmath29 m and @xmath30 m .",
    "the existence of such small grains is also implied by the small scattering asymmetry factor ( @xmath31 for the hd  141569a disk is quoted as @xmath32 in c03 ] ) of the henyey - greenstein function derived by c03 .",
    "the multicomponent models by ll03 suggest that the minimum grain size is between @xmath33 m and @xmath34 m : the smaller limit produces too little emission in the _ iras _ 60 @xmath35 m band and the larger limit produces too much emission in the _ iras _ 60 @xmath35 m and 100 @xmath35 m bands . taken together ,",
    "these arguments imply that there is a population of grains whose radii may extend down to @xmath33 m .",
    "the combined influences of the reduced scattering efficiency ( @xmath36 ) of small grains and the small number of large grains ( assuming a size distribution going as @xmath27 ) produce sharply peaked scattering opacity , which indicates that the grain sizes responsible for the optical images of the disk are of the order of the wavelength of observation .",
    "figure [ draine ] shows the scattering opacity at @xmath10 m as a function of grain radius for astronomical silicate grains @xcite larger than @xmath37 m .",
    "the scattering opacity is expressed as the scattering cross section per unit mass ( @xmath38 , where @xmath39 ) , weighted by mass and number of grains at each radius @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the function is centered at @xmath41 m with a characteristic width of @xmath42 m . the sharp decrease in the scattering opacity of grains larger than @xmath41 m",
    "is determined by the behavior of the first scattering peak in @xmath36 . in the limit of large grains ,",

    "@xmath45 m grains scatter @xmath46 times less than @xmath41 m grains , and @xmath47 times more than @xmath34 m grains .",
    "the location and width of the peak in the scattering opacity depends on the surface properties of the grains and the exact mixture of silicates , ices , and empty space .",
    "for example , increasing porosity moves the peak to smaller sizes and less - reflecting grains broaden the peak and move it to larger sizes @xcite .    if  as suggested by the disk colors , the phase of the scattering function and the spectral energy distribution ",
    "submicron - sized grains exist in the disk , their dynamics are strongly influenced by rp . according to ta01 ,",
    "the ratio ( @xmath2 ) of the forces from rp and gravity is @xmath23 for a @xmath45 m dust grain , and @xmath48 for @xmath49 m . for the very porous grains assumed by ll03 , @xmath50 for @xmath51 m . formally , and in the absence of gas , grains with @xmath52 ( `` @xmath2-meteoroids '' ) are expelled from the disk .",
    "grains with large @xmath2 will acquire a radial velocity on the order of their keplerian velocity in @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the orbital period at a given position ( ta01 ) . at the edge of a 500  au disk around a 2.3 m@xmath55 star , @xmath56 yr for @xmath57 .",
    "such short expulsion timescales are somewhat mitigated by the effects of another force : the gas drag .",
    "@xcite measured the gas content of hd  141569a s disk using the detected @xmath58 transition for @xmath59co and the upper limit on the same line for @xmath60co .",
    "they assumed that the star s distance was 200  pc , its disk had a radius of 130  au , and that h2/co @xmath24 10000 .",
    "they calculated gas masses between 20 and @xmath61 for optically thin and optically thick limits , respectively .",
    "assuming that the gas and dust disks are coincident , we recompute the gas content using the observed extent of the optical disk and the measured _ hipparcos _ distance to hd  141569a of 99 pc .",
    "@xcite have generously provided us with their unpublished digitized co spectra , which are reproduced in figure [ zuckerman ] . the spectra show a double peak characteristic of sharp disks , although the depths of the central line - emission in both measurements are a little over @xmath62 per resolution element .",
    "assuming an disk inclination of @xmath63 ( c03 ) , the velocity difference between the peaks is @xmath64  km  s@xmath65 , which implies emission at @xmath66  au .",

    "nondetection of the @xmath60co line yields an upper limit of @xmath70  mk , so the opacity of the @xmath59co line is uncertain .",

    ", the gas is assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "we now explore the interaction between small dust grains , gas , and the radiation and gravitational fields of hd  141569a , while ignoring the presence of the binary companions .",
    "most of the results of this axisymmetric treatment should be applicable to other debris and gas disks in which rp is important .",
    "the regime that we explore here is that of modest amounts of gas ( up to 50 m@xmath17 ) and not very large values of @xmath2 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "our calculations are complementary to those of @xcite , who consider @xmath74 and ta01 , who consider @xmath75 .",
    "notice that @xcite has shown that if the observed dust particles all have @xmath76 , a single ring of planetesimals in a gasless disk will produce a dust disk with surface density given by @xmath77 , as observed here .",
    "we solve the equations of motion for a dust grain , assuming that it is subject to rp , pr and gas drag . the gas is assumed to be in a circular orbit and we assume the same dust model as ta01 .",

    "the dust grain speeds are supersonic and almost radial at the outer edge of the disk ( figure [ rad_vel ] ) . the dimensionless stopping time",
    "( the stopping time in units of the inverse local keplerian frequency ) at the edge of the disk is given by ( ta01 ) :    @xmath90    which for the parameters considered here is @xmath91 .",
    "notice that , unlike in the case considered by @xcite , the radial velocity shown here does not have a deceleration region , because in our case the gas surface density decreases with radius : the radiation pressure always dominates the dynamics of the dust .",
    "the effect of gas on the grains depends on where the grains were created .",
    "figure [ time_it_takes ] shows that for a fixed value of @xmath2 and without gas , particles that start closer to the star soon overtake particles farther out .",
    "this changes with the presence of gas , because the drag force decreases outward , and for @xmath92m@xmath17 masses of gas , the particles created closer in will not overtake those created farther out",
    ". figure  [ time_it_takes ] also shows that the gas mass , not the grain size , determines the escape timescale : there is not much difference between @xmath57 and @xmath93 for @xmath94 of gas , because both the gas drag and the rp are proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "if one assumes a rate of dust generation , the results of these calculations can be used to predict the steady - state dust surface density in an isolated disk . in such a state ,",
    "grains are continuously generated by collisions and then blown away by rp . the dust surface density",
    "( assuming conservation in the number of particles ) is given by    @xmath95    where @xmath96 is the inner radius of dust generation , @xmath88 is the position at which the grains are created , @xmath97 is the number of grains created at @xmath88 , and @xmath98 is the radial velocity at @xmath99 of grains created at @xmath88 .",
    "the dust creation rate per unit volume is taken to be v@xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the number of planetesimals per unit volume , @xmath102 is the collision cross section and v@xmath103 is the relative velocity between the planetesimals , which is proportional to the dimensionless planetesimal disk thickness ( @xmath104 ) times the keplerian velocity @xcite .",
    "this implies @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the surface density of planetesimals at the creation point , which we assume to be proportional to @xmath82 .    in practice , this simple prescription ( the `` quadratic '' dust generation prescription ) may be affected by uncertainties in the planetesimal size distribution and in the relative velocities among the the planetesimals . to explore the sensitivity of the results to the exact generation mechanism we also consider a `` linear '' dust generation prescription in which @xmath107 .    for these calculations",
    "we assume that the planetesimals and the gas are well mixed and therefore @xmath108 .",
    "the resulting steady - state surface densities are shown in figures  [ 1d_model ] and [ 1d_model2 ] . in the figures ,",
    "the unit length is 1000 au .",
    "figure [ 1d_model ] shows that even modest amounts of gas have a significant effect on the surface - density profiles .",
    "the amounts of gas considered ( 10 and @xmath94 ) are not enough to confine the dust grains created at distances larger than 0.01 , but gas drag sharpens the profiles , as it slows down the dust particles .",
    "notice that if dust creation starts very close to the central star , the resultant surface - density profiles are effectively featureless .",
    "figures  [ 1d_model ] and [ 1d_model2 ] also show that a broad ring of dust is produced by truncating the dust creation within a certain radius . just outside this limit ,",
    "the number and surface density of planetesimals , and hence dust grains , are large .",
    "far from the creation limit , the surface density of the dust decreases because of decreasing surface density of planetesimals and the geometric dilution of `` blown out '' dust grains created at smaller radii .",
    "thus , if a mechanism exists for preventing the creation of dust at small radii ( for example , a planet that clears out the parent planetesimals ) , the result is , very naturally , a broad ring of dust at larger radii . the rate at which dust is lost from the disk depends on the rate of planetesimal erosion . in principle",
    ", one can use use the former to estimate the latter .",
    "ll03 calculated the amount of mass lost from hd  141569a s disk , assuming no gas , a grain - size distribution @xmath109 , @xmath2=1 for grains of all sizes , and a constant rate of mass loss throughout the age of the system .",
    "they also assumed a surface - density profile for the dust that is slightly different than the one shown in figure  [ profiles ] .",
    "they concluded that @xmath110 of solid material have been lost , in particles with @xmath111 m , from the disk due to rp and pr drag .    to examine the effect of the gas on the rate of mass loss",
    ", we consider a disk of radius 500  au about hd  141569a and no binary companions .",
    "figure  [ timescale ] shows the time required for small dust grains to move from a given radius to the edge of the disk for different values of gas mass and temperature .",
    "the presence of just @xmath112 of gas triples the escape time from 200  au , and a colder disk confines the dust more than a hotter one .",
    "( equation  [ fg ] shows that , neglecting @xmath80 , a colder  denser  gas disk , produces more drag ) . assuming a grain - size distribution @xmath113 , with @xmath94 of gas in lte , varying escape times , the ta01 dust model and a constant rate of mass - loss , we determine that @xmath114 of solid material have been lost over the @xmath115  myr age of the disk , in particles with sizes @xmath116 m . without gas , @xmath117 of solid material would have been lost .",
    "the difference with ll03 is due to the fact that in our calculation different size particles have different blow - out timescales .",
    "however , neither ll03 s estimate nor ours can be correct . because small grains ( @xmath118 m ) are quickly expelled from the disk , they must be the dominant component of the lost mass .",
    "if the grain - size distribution is @xmath113 for grains with radii @xmath119  mm , then grains up to 10 @xmath120 m compose only ten percent of the disk mass .",
    "the bulk of the dust mass comprises large grains that are eliminated in much longer timescales .",
    "if the collisional processes responsible for the replenishment of small grains also produce large grains , then submillimeter observations should detect @xmath121 of dust , which greatly exceeds the amount of @xmath122 measured by @xcite .",
    "one possible solution to this discrepancy is that the dust is not generated with a power - law size distribution , but with a distribution weighted toward small particles .",
    "the collisional - evolution models of @xcite suggest that , although large variations in the dust distribution are possible , most of the mass produced by the collisions is in large particles .",
    "these models assume that the collisional timescale is smaller than any other timescale in the disk .",
    "another possible solution is that the current rate of dust creation is larger than it has been in the past .",
    "this possibility is consistent with the idea that the disk has been recently stirred by a close encounter with a companion or unbound star . in section [ model ]",
    "we show that a parabolic encounter would occur over timescales on the order of @xmath123 yrs . over this time the disk would lose ( according to the model above ) @xmath124 of solids in small particles , or @xmath125 in particles up to 1  mm in size , close to the measured value .",
    "observationally , the presence of @xmath126 of solids in @xmath127m - sized particles ( section  [ obscons ] ) suggests that there is currently on the order of @xmath128 in particles up to 8 @xmath35 m in size , with the exact number depending on the assumed value of the opacity and dust size distribution .    furthermore",
    ", these estimates support the idea of a single exciting event , like an encounter with an unbound companion , as opposed to repeated exciting events . in the models by @xcite , which assume a bound companion , repeated encounters are required to explain the brightness asymmetries in the debris disk .",
    "the presence of large - scale spiral arms suggests that the dynamical influence of the binary companions , hd  141569b and c , is important .",
    "if they are coplanar with the disk , their center of mass is @xmath129  au away from the primary star and their separation is @xmath130  au .",
    "@xcite assumed that the companions are bound to hd  141569a in a very eccentric orbit .",
    "their dynamical models show that close encounters between the companions and the disk produced well - developed spiral rings within the disk after only a few periastron passages",
    ". however , the models do not maintain large - scale spiral arms after a few orbits .",
    "thus , within their model , the interaction geometry needed to create the spiral rings in the disk is not consistent with the presence of the large - scale spiral arms .",
    "the hydrodynamic model by @xcite does produce spiral arms after repeated close encounters , because the viscosity and gas pressure help generate a spiral at every periastron passage .",
    "however , the amount of gas actually present in the disk (  2.2 ) discourages the notion that the dynamics of the dust conforms to that of the gas .",
    "figure [ time_it_takes ] shows that , for a reasonable range of gas mass , @xmath2-meteoroid grains responsible for the scattered - light disk are impeded by gas drag , but they are not bound by the gas .",
    "so the assumption by @xcite that gas dynamics control the observed structures in the dust disk is not appropriate .",
    "we assume that the encounter between the disk and the binary companions is a parabolic fly - by , a situation known to produce spiral arms in dusty disks @xcite .",
    "such an encounter is consistent with the proper motion of the system . within an error box of 01",
    ", the position of the companions relative to hd  141569a has not changed over the 60  yr baseline of observations noted by @xcite .",
    "the largest expected relative motion is obtained when the system is currently at periastron and the encounter occurs in the plane of the sky . in this scenario , the relative motion of the companions over 60",

    "first , we obtain the distribution of planetesimals and gas as a function of time .",
    "then , for each planetesimal configuration , we generate a dust distribution and follow it as a function of time .",

    "the ratio @xmath2 , which couples the dust and the radiation , is also a free parameter .",
    "we explore two values : ( 1 ) @xmath57 , which corresponds to @xmath51 m ( ta01 ) or @xmath148 m ( ll03 ) , and ( 2 ) @xmath93 , which corresponds to @xmath149 m ( ta01 ) or @xmath51 m ( ll03 ) .",
    "we assume a single value of @xmath2 per simulation , which is equivalent to assuming that the scattering opacity ( figure  [ draine ] ) is a delta function .    to obtain the dust distribution at a given time , we consider all the dust particles created at previous times .",
    "figure [ multi_prof ] shows the behavior of dust particles created at various time intervals for @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath145 , and linear dust creation .",
    "the generations of particles were tracked to @xmath152 , and their respective surface densities were summed and azimuthally averaged at each time interval .",
    "this simulation tracks the entire history of dust generation , but in practice , dust blowout eliminates from the `` current '' surface density profile all the contributions of dust created before the last half time unit ( i.e. , @xmath153 ) .",
    "we now present our models for the fly - by encounter with a composite disk of planetesimals , gas , and dust .",
    "representative simulations are shown in figures  [ evolution][results4 ] .",
    "although most of the models are shown at @xmath152 , the images and profiles are representative of @xmath154 .",
    "to give our distance and time scales physical meaning , we set the distance between hd  141569a and the barycenter of the companions at @xmath152 equal to that observed in the acs images ( c03 ) .",
    "thus , one distance unit corresponds to 718  au and one time unit corresponds to 1800  yr . the companions are out of the frames .    for each of the figures  [ evolution][results4 ] we show the predicted logarithm of the density profile with linear dust generation ( top row ) or quadratic dust generation ( bottom row ) .",
    "the use of the logarithmic stretch allow us to highlight faint features .",
    "the images are all normalized to the same arbitrary constant . in general",
    ", the color table of the bottom row has a lower limit value that the color table at the top row .",
    "this means that `` white '' in the bottom panels corresponds to somewhat less material than it does in the top panels . in this way",
    ", we can show faint features in the bottom rows that would not be visible were we to use the same color table as that from the top rows .",
    "this modification has little effect on the color the dark features , which implies that all panels within a given figure can be compared to each other . as mentioned before ,",
    "an artificial inner hole has been set for the linear ( at @xmath155 ) and quadratic simulations ( at @xmath156 ) . in each panel",
    ", the plot inset compares the measured density profile with the model density profile .",
    "the latter is normalized to the value measured at 500  au .",
    "figure  [ evolution ] shows the evolution of the dust structures for @xmath4 , @xmath151 , @xmath145 , an initial disk size of one unit distance , and both linear and quadratic dust generation .",
    "figures  [ results1 ] and [ results2 ] show the effect of the amount of gas on @xmath57 and @xmath93 dust particles , respectively .",
    "the sharp , concentric rings in the gasless models ( panels 1 and 4 ) are artifacts of discrete dust generation .",
    "figure  [ results3 ] illustrates the role of the gas temperature , and figure  [ results4 ] shows the roles of disk sizes and planets .",
    "a side - by - side comparison of the observed disk and our favorite model is presented in figure  [ comparison ] .",
    "all the models look similar . despite the dynamical importance of rp , the overall appearance of the dust disk",
    "resembles the underlying distribution of planetesimals .",
    "figures  [ results1 ] and [ results2 ] show that models with gas reproduce the observed profiles better than models without gas , but it is not clear that @xmath112 of @xmath157 gas ( panel 2 of each figure ) is better than @xmath94 of @xmath157 gas ( panel 3 of each figure ) .",
    "there are no significant qualitative differences between the @xmath57 and @xmath93 conditions shown in figures [ results1 ] and [ results2 ] , respectively , as expected from the results in  [ conf ] .",
    "there is also no clearly preferred prescription for dust creation .",
    "the quadratic prescription does produce a more disorganized structure , as the dust is mostly generated in the denser spiral arms .",
    "overdensities in the planetesimal distribution produce streams of matter in these models .",
    "nevertheless , the combination of large @xmath2 and quadratic dust generation with @xmath157 gas ( figure  [ results2 ] , panels 5 and 6 ) reproduces very well the decay of the surface - density profile . notice that because more gas confines the dust better , the spirals in panels 3 and 6 of each figure look darker than the others .    figure [ results3 ] shows that the simulations are sensitive to the gas temperature .",
    "cold gas ( panels 1 and 4 ) tends to produce sharper spiral structures than hot gas , because cold gas is denser and imparts greater drag on the dust .",
    "this effect is less pronounced for quadratic dust generation , as the large density variations obscure the temperature - dependent effects of the gas .",
    "all the models produce a two - armed spiral .",
    "the arms are less pronounced for quadratic dust generation than for the linear dust generation because the former emphasizes regions of large planetesimal density .",
    "the density and extent of the arm diametrically opposite the companions can be reduced ( and made more compatible with the observations ) by diminishing the size of the initial disk ( figure  [ results4 ] ) .",
    "the appearance of this arm can also be changed with a different encounter geometry .",
    "@xcite show that , in a encounter between a circumstellar disk and a passing star , the spiral arm opposite the projectile is affected by the indirect tidal component of the potential , which diminishes as the collision becomes more hyperbolic .    in general , the models with quadratic dust generation produce more disorganized images than models with linear dust generation .",
    "planetesimal condensates are strong sources of dust that produce `` noise '' in the models .",
    "however , they also produce more peaked surface - density profiles , which match the observed profiles better .",
    "flatter initial density profiles ( not shown here ) produce large amounts of dust at large distances . disks with initial radii larger than @xmath241000  au produce remnant structures that are not observed , including very long spiral arms .",
    "conversely , disks with an initial radius of 400  au yield dust distribution that reproduce well the observed large - scale arms and surface - density profiles ( figure  [ results4 ] ) .",
    "we surmise from our models that hd  141569a s initial planetesimal and gas disks had radii @xmath158  au and 1050  @xmath159 of @xmath157 gas ( figure  [ comparison ] ) .      from figure  [ multi_prof ]",
    "it seems clear that different dust configurations ( i.e. large holes ) can be created by manipulating the dust generation history of the system .",
    "the size of the hole can be controlled by varying @xmath2 or the time between dust generations .",
    "though theoretically possible , such contrived scenarios are physically unreasonable .    a more reasonable agent for creating a hole in the dust distribution is a planet ( or planets ) within @xmath21  au .",
    "if large enough , planets would clear out the planetesimals and the gas , and create a region without dust .",
    "each planet would sweep up a lane along its orbit as wide as a few times its hill radius , @xmath160 . from @xcite , a @xmath5 planet with a semimajor axis of 100  au and eccentricity",
    "@xmath161 would clear a region with a half - width of 90  au .",
    "alternatively , multiple planets in less eccentric orbits would have similar effect .    here",
    "we present exploratory simulations that include the effect of a giant planet .",
    "panels  2 and 4 of figure  [ results4 ] show models that include a @xmath5 planet in an eccentric orbit ( @xmath162 ) around hd  141569a with a semi - major axis of 100  au .",
    "the planet clears the central region enough to greatly reduce the dust generation close to the star and produce an inner hole in the dust disk .",
    "weak signatures of the eccentricity ( the elongated shape and slight dust overdensities at the top and the bottom of the hole ) are observed .",
    "the inner ring in the observed density profile is not reproduced in the observations , at least with these orbital parameters .",
    "considering the uncertainties in the exact dust configuration close to the coronagraphic mask , this is a satisfactory result .",
    "a @xmath5 planet of age 5  myr would be @xmath163 times less luminous , and over 12 magnitudes fainter in @xmath164 , than hd  141569a @xcite .",
    "such an planet would be below the non - coronagraphic nicmos detection limits @xcite .",
    "the formation of small planets may produce sharp rings in the disk by stirring nearby planetesimals and enhancing dust generation .",
    "this process has been modeled in detail by @xcite . both this effect and the presence of a giant planet modeled above produce inner ring variability on timescales of @xmath165  yr .",
    "our favored model of the scattered - light disk is shown in figure [ comparison ] .",
    "this model assumes an initial disk size of 400  au , @xmath150 , and gas with with mass @xmath94 and an opening angle of @xmath157 .",
    "the model reproduces the large - scale spiral arms and , despite a large value of @xmath2 , produces localized structures .",
    "it does not reproduce the sharp and coherent rings or disk asymmetries of the disk around hd  141569a , as observed by c03 , which suggests that a different encounter geometry should be considered .",
    "the model includes a @xmath5 planet in an eccentric orbit ( @xmath161 ) with apastron 160  au for the purpose of clearing out a region of planetesimals close to the central star .",
    "the characteristics of this planet are not tightly constrained by the model , and other configurations ( including multiple planets ) are possible .",
    "the simulations clearly indicate that a mechanism capable of clearing the inside of the disk ( like a planet or planets ) is necessary to explain the observed density profile . there may be additional observational evidence supporting the existence of a planet .",
    "@xcite have detected h@xmath166 within 7  au of hd  141569a , which they suggest may come from the extended atmosphere from a giant protoplanet .",
    "although there is favorable evidence for the existence of planet(s ) , we should also consider the effect of ice condensation on the surface density of the dust . an abrupt change in the surface density is expected upon crossing the `` snow line , '' which for hd  141569a s disk is @xmath21  au ( ll03 ) .",
    "the location of the snow line depends strongly on grain size , so it likely varies with observed wavelength .",
    "current coronagraphic images lack the spectral resolution needed to probe these variations . while crossing the snow line can not explain the paucity of dust close to the star , it likely affects the shape of the observed surface density .",
    "most of the gas simulations do a similar job reproducing the optical depth images and profiles .",
    "it would seem that the only hard constraint that they provide is that the presence of gas is necessary .",
    "the quadratic dust generation method does a somewhat better job than the linear one in matching the density profiles .",
    "interestingly , figure  [ conclusion ] shows that the planetesimal distribution itself can also match the outer surface density profile .",
    "the surface density of planetesimals starts as @xmath82 , but the truncation by the encounter makes it steeper by the time the simulations are examined .",
    "the surface density of dust generated quadratically also matches the distribution of planetesimals : while the dust is generated as the square of the planetesimal distribution , it is blown outward by radiation pressure .",
    "this process tends to flatten the simulated profile .",
    "the applicability of our models to the debris disk around hd  141569a depends on the premise that the observed dust grains are small enough so that @xmath167 .",
    "this condition is borne out by the disk colors , the mean - scattering phase , and thermal models .",
    "could larger particles ( @xmath168 ) be contributing to the observed scattered light image ? in deriving the scattering - opacity function ( figure  [ draine ] ) , we assumed that the collisional equilibrium timescale is smaller than any other systemic timescale , which implies that the number of grains of size @xmath40 decreases as @xmath27 .",
    "if small grains were more quickly removed from their points of creation , then an excess of larger grains would result because they would no longer suffer erosion from collisions with the smaller grains @xcite . in the absence of gas ,",
    "@xmath168 grains are eliminated by pr drag on timescales orders of magnitude larger than the rp timescales @xcite , so the proportion of larger grains would further increase . however , in the presence of modest amounts of gas , @xmath168 grains migrate to stationary orbits ( ta01 ) , and small particles settle down at the outer edge of the disk .",
    "the timescale over which this migration occurs is quite small for small grains , but larger than the purely dynamical timescales associated with @xmath52 motions .",
    "all these processes may alter the shape of the dust size distribution . if , for example , the distribution is flatter than @xmath27 , then the peak of the scattering - opacity function is broadened . while the optical image of the disk may still be dominated by @xmath2-meteoroids , the contributions of larger",
    ", bound grains may be significant .",
    "the entangled roles of rp , gas drag , and the dynamical role of the companions greatly complicate any effort to model all components of the disk .",
    "to do so successfully requires multi - wavelength images of the disk .",
    "observations by the _ spitzer space telescope _ should soon help this situation , as _ spitzer _ will observe larger grains that are less affected by rp .",
    "future observations with the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) will also contribute valuable information about the composition and distribution of the dust .",
    "we have developed dynamical models to investigate the structures observed in the debris disk around hd  141569a .",
    "the models include , for the first time , the effects of radiation pressure and gas drag .",
    "the disk s colors and scattering phase indicate that the scattered - light images are produced by submicron - sized dust grains . to understand these images",
    ", we must consider the behavior of grains with values of @xmath2 ( the ratio of radiation and gravitational forces ) larger than one .",
    "these grains are expelled from the disk in shorter - than - dynamical timescales .",
    "we show that up to @xmath0 of gas may be present in the disk .",
    "gas drag slows the blow - out of grains and is fundamental to understanding the structure of the disk .",
    "if the dust is continuously created , its steady - state surface density is featureless and has a radial profile dependent upon the amount of gas and the prescription for dust creation . to produce a broad ring of dust",
    ", its creation must be prevented within some inner radial limit ( figure [ 1d_model2 ] ) . in principle , one can use the observed surface - density profile to estimate the amount of mass lost from by the disk throughout its history .",
    "however , because large grains remain in the disk longer than smaller grains , this estimation implies an implausible amount of solid material in the disk .",
    "consequently , either the observed rate of dust generation is limited to times near the encounter of the disk with hd  141569a s binary companions , or small grains are created highly preferentially over larger ones .",
    "inspired by disk s large - scale spiral arms , we explored the effect on the disk from a parabolic fly - by of the binary companions .",
    "such an encounter is consistent with the measured proper motion of the system .",
    "our models consider the dynamical evolution of three different populations : planetesimals ( subject only to gravity ) , gas ( subject to gravity and hydrodynamic forces ) , and dust ( subject to gravity , radiation pressure and gas drag ) .",
    "the poynting - robertson effect , self - gravity , and the dynamical effects of collisions are ignored .",
    "we vary @xmath2 , the initial gas mass , the gas disk opening angle , and the prescription for dust generation .",
    "we find that the dust distribution resembles that of the contemporary planetesimal distribution .",
    "the models are most sensitive to the gas temperature , with hotter gas producing more disorganized structures than colder gas .",
    "five - fold differences in the gas mass and two - fold differences in @xmath2 do not produce significant differences in the simulated disks .",
    "quadratic dust generation produces more disorganized and less distinct structures than linear dust generation .",
    "smaller initial disks produce smaller and less pronounced spiral arms .",
    "our favored model ( figure  [ comparison ] ) has an initial disk size of 400  au , @xmath150 , and gas with with mass @xmath94 and an opening angle of @xmath157 .",
    "a planet is introduced to reduce the surface density of the planetesimals close to the central star , but the characteristics of this planet are not tightly constrained .",
    "the model successfully reproduces the large - scale structures seen in the scattered - light images of the disk .",
    "however , the model does not reproduce the tightly - wound spiral rings or other observed asymmetries , which suggests that another population of grains ( perhaps with smaller @xmath2 ) or a non - coplanar encounter geometry should be investigated .",
