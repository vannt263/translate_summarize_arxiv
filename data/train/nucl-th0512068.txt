    "the study of the nucleon / hyperon mean free paths in nuclei / nuclear matter is an important aspect for us to know about the nucleon / hyperon in - medium properties , because the nucleon / hyperon mean free paths relate with the nucleon - nucleon / hyperon - nucleon interactions in nuclear matter . in nuclear reactions , the nucleon / hyperon mean free path is a useful concept for summarizing a large number of experimental data , because the nucleon / hyperon mean free path in a nucleus can be introduced from the cross sections of the nucleon / hyperon - nucleus reactions , which can be obtained from experiment directly .    since the work of bethe @xcite in 1940 , there has been considerable interest in the study of the mean free path of a proton or neutron in the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "however , theoretical calculation on hyperon mean free path in nuclear medium has never been done due to the scarce experimental data on hyperon - nucleon / nucleus interactions . recently , some experimental progresses on hyperon increased the necessary for the study of the hyperon mean free path in nuclei . in this paper , we will firstly attempt to calculate the hyperon mean free paths in nuclei in the framework of rmf theory .",
    "the rmf theory have been used to study the nucleon mean free paths @xcite . with rmf method ,",
    "the nucleon mean free path was found to be in reasonable agreement with experimental data .",
    "thus , in present work , we also study the @xmath0 and @xmath1-hyperon mean free paths in nuclei with rmf method . to calculate the hyperon mean free path in a nucleus ,",
    "the essential point is to construct the energy - dependent hyperon - nucleus optical potentials . in this work ,",

    "we find that , in the central of the nuclei , the hyperon mean free path is about @xmath6 fm for @xmath0 , and about @xmath7 fm for @xmath1 , depending on the hyperon incident energy .",
