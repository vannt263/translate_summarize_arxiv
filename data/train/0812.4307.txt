    "neutron induced elastic scattering processes represent an important background for direct dark matter detection experiments searching for weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , which may constitute the dark matter in the universe  @xcite .",
    "direct searches for wimps have been carried out by many experiments including cdms  @xcite , edelweiss  @xcite , xenon10  @xcite , ardm  @xcite , dama  @xcite , cresst  @xcite , picasso  @xcite , naiad  @xcite , and zeplin  @xcite . among these experiments ,",
    "dama / nai  @xcite and dama / libra  @xcite have claimed that they have observed a model independent annual modulation signature .",
    "the dama collaboration interprets this annual modulation as the signature induced by dark matter ( dm ) particles  @xcite .",
    "however , this claim is at odds with other experimental results if one assumes standard wimp interactions and halo models . with the best limits set by cdms ii  @xcite and xenon10 , wimps remain unobserved .",
    "large scale next generation detectors utilizing noble liquids to continue the direct search for wimps are underway .",
    "the key to these experiments lies in the ability to reduce various background to unprecedented low levels . among all possible sources of background ,",
    "neutron induced nuclear recoil is identified as a major source of background for this type of experiments .",
    "there are three sources of underground neutrons : 1 ) those produced by ( @xmath2 reactions through thorium , uranium , and other radioactive isotope decays in the materials that surround or constitute the detector ; 2 ) those from spontaneous uranium fission ; and 3 ) those from cosmic ray muon - induced processes . in general ,",
    "the ( @xmath2 neutrons dominate the total neutron contributions to the measured background for an underground experiment .",
    "this is because the origins of ( @xmath3 neutrons range from surrounding rock , external shielding , inner shielding , detector components , and detector target . in particular ,",
    "the ( @xmath2 neutrons produced in the detector components and target are hard to cope with .",
    "these neutrons need to be understood very well in terms of their origin , transport , and interaction with materials .",
    "calculations of the neutron yield and neutron energy spectrum in different materials are critical to dark matter experiments .",
    "the total neutron yield indicates the number of neutrons that enter or are produced in the target .",
    "the neutron energy spectrum determines the total background events in the region of interest ( roi ) .",
    "therefore , a full simulation of neutron background must take into account both neutron yield and energy spectrum .",
    "this paper is aimed at providing the ( @xmath2 neutron yield and energy spectrum for a number of materials that are used for the construction of dark matter detectors .",
    "the neutron yields from the ( @xmath2 reaction for various elements of natural isotopic concentrations have been discussed by many authors  @xcite .",
    "the decays of @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the materials produce mev @xmath0 particles .",
    "these @xmath0 particles interact with the nucleus in a thick target and yield neutrons .",
    "the neutron yield is calculated by  @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the initial energy of the @xmath0-particle , @xmath8 is the mass stopping power of element @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the atomic mass of element @xmath9 and @xmath11 is avogadro s constant . in secular equilibrium ,",
    "the @xmath12th decay chain yields 6 @xmath0 s and the @xmath13u decay chain produces 8 @xmath0 s with various energies @xmath14 .",
    "the neutron yields in the decay chains of @xmath12th and @xmath13u can be determined by the sum of the individual yields induced by each @xmath0 , weighted by the branching ratio for each element and weighted by the mass ratio in the host material .",
    "the energy attenuation of the @xmath0-particles in the medium is the dominant process for the thick target hypothesis . under the assumption that the incident flux of @xmath0-particles with energy of @xmath14 is invariant until the energy is attenuated to zero , for target element @xmath9 ,",
    "the differential spectra of neutron yield can be expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total number of atoms for the i@xmath17 element in the host material , @xmath18 is the flux of @xmath0-particles with specific energy @xmath14 , @xmath19 refers to the @xmath0-particle production rate for the decay with the energy @xmath14 from @xmath12th or @xmath13u decay chain .",
    "if we consider the specific activity of @xmath12th and @xmath13u in terms of the concentration in ppm / g / y , then @xmath20 where @xmath21 stands for the atomic mass number of @xmath12th or @xmath13u , @xmath22 represents the @xmath0-particle branching ratio for a specific energy decay channel @xmath14 , and @xmath23 is the half life of the decay .    the cross section in eq.([diff ] ) , @xmath24 , is calculated by the talys simulation code  @xcite in which the cross sections of neutron production for all possible reaction channels are calculated . the flux of @xmath0-particles is obtained by combining the production rate of @xmath0-particles with the corresponding mass stopping power in the target . the mass stopping power for specific energies is calculated by our simulation described in ref .",
    "@xcite and the astar program  @xcite .",
    "we use the decay chains of selected isotopes in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0-particle emission from @xmath4 and @xmath5 decays .",
    "only decays with visible energies larger than 0.1 mev or branching ratio more than 0.5% are included .",
    "the @xmath25 induced neutron yield is calculated for a number of elements by using eq.([diff ] ) and eq.([added ] ) .",
    "the differential energy spectra of neutrons for specific target elements are listed in tables [ ratear ] to [ ratefe ] and plotted in figures  [ fig : ar ] to  [ fig : fe ] .",
    "only the results for neutron energies greater than 0.1 mev with the energy bin size of 0.1 mev are presented .",
    "note that the calculations with the thick target model under equilibrium conditions give the maximum contribution of the neutron yield .",
    "it s worthwhile to note that we also calculated the @xmath25 neutron yield for lead .",
    "however , the result showed that there is no @xmath25 neutron yield in lead due to a very high coulomb barrier which largely restricts the ( @xmath0,n ) reactions .",
    "the neutron yield from spontaneous @xmath26 fission is about @xmath27 of the total neutron yields from uranium and thorium decays .",
    "those neutrons from @xmath26 with a natural isotropic abundance of @xmath28 is not included in these tables .",
    "the @xmath0-particles from samarium , a dopant of the glasses for pmts at a level of @xmath290.1% to @xmath291%  @xcite depending on the type of glasses , have a maximum energy of 2.5 mev . as a result ,",
    "the induced neutrons are less energetic ( @xmath30 5 mev ) compared to the neutrons caused by uranium and thorium decays .",
    "we compared our results with the calculations made by heaton _ et .",
    "@xcite , and found the total number of neutron yields in good agreement .",
    "note that the neutron energy spectra in various elements are quite different .",
    "neutron induced background in the region of interest for dark matter experiments is very sensitive to the neutron energy .",
    "thus the neutron energy spectrum is very important in the monte carlo simulation that evaluates the neutron induced background for various dark matter experiments .    [",
