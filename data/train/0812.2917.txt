    "tensor modes of the classical large scale cosmological perturbations are produced from the quantum fluctuations of gravitons @xcite .",
    "their amplitude is proportional to the energy scale of inflation , and their spectrum extends over a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "gravitational waves at the cosmological , long - wavelength part of the spectrum lead to b - mode polarization of the cmb anisotropy fluctuations .",
    "in high energy models of inflation ( like chaotic inflation ) , where the ratio of the amplitudes of the tensor to scalar modes is about @xmath0 , the b - mode of anisotropies should be detectable by forthcoming cmb polarization experiments .",
    "however , in anticipation of a null signal observation of gw from inflation , one might still be able to use gw to constrain inflationary models in ways other than just constraining the overall energy scale .",
    "there are models of inflation where the total number of inflationary e - folds @xmath1 exceeds the minimum required to homogenize the observable universe only by a small margin . for such models with anisotropic pre - inflationary expansion , gravity waves from pre - inflation are amplified and may contribute to the large scale cmb temperature anisotropy @xcite .",
    "observational limits on gravity waves from cmb polarization experiments also result in constraints on @xmath1 .",
    "if inflation occurs at lower energies ( as in many hybrid inflation models ) , the amplitude of the resulting gravity waves would be too weak to be observed with cmb anistropies .",
    "however , gw from inflation at the short - wavelength part of the spectrum might fall in the amplitude - frequency range which accessible to future gravity wave astronomy projects such as bbo and decigo .",
    "these experiments could probe @xmath2 down to the level @xmath3 .",
    "gravity waves may also carry unique information about the post - inflationary dynamics , in particular the inflaton decay and the subsequent evolution of its decay products towards thermal equilibrium .",
    "often this process starts with preheating , a violent non - perturbative restructuring of the field configurations shortly after inflation .",
    "preheating leads to large , non - linear field inhomogeneities which necessarily generate a classical gw background .",
    "this mechanism of gw production is complementary to the production of gw from vacuum fluctuations during inflation . in our previous paper @xcite we developed a machinery for analytic and numerical calculations of gw production in preheating models .",
    "there are several other papers on the subject that we will discuss below .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the techniques used to study gw from preheating have parallels in calculations of gw from phase transitions / hydrodynamical turbulence , see e.g. @xcite and references therein . in @xcite we developed applications of our methods to the example of preheating after chaotic inflation .",
    "the parameters of these large - field models are fixed by cmb normalization , which ensures that inflation must occur at high energy scales . as a result ,",
    "the gravity waves produced from preheating in these models have typical frequencies of order @xmath4 hz , which is far beyond the observable range ( see section [ discussion ] for observational constraints ) . as conjectured in @xcite , preheating after low - energy inflation may generate gw with lower frequencies @xmath5 .",
    "one of the most popular and most studied models of inflation and preheating is hybrid inflation @xcite with tachyonic preheating @xcite .",
    "there are many hybrid inflation models , notably in the context of supergravity ( see @xcite for a review ) and string theory ( see @xcite for reviews ) . in these models , the energy scale of inflation is not fixed by cmb normalization , so it was optimistically thought that for some parameters the frequency of gw from preheating may fall into an observable range .",
    "the subject of this paper is gw production from tachyonic preheating , in particular , assessing how realistic is the range of parameters that may lead to an observable signal .",
    "let us briefly review the literature on the subject .",
    "the production of gravitational waves from preheating was originally studied in @xcite for chaotic inflation , and recently by several groups in @xcite .",
    "the first numerical methods @xcite were based on the weinberg formalism @xcite , which , strictly speaking is applicable only for isolated sources in a minkowski background .",
    "this may lead to significant differences in the resulting gravity wave spectra , as explained in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the gravity wave equations in an expanding universe were solved in fourier space .",
    "another method was used in @xcite , where the evolution equation for metric perturbations were solved in configuration space . in @xcite and the earlier version of @xcite the transverse - traceless radiative part of gw was not properly extracted but after discussion of the problem in @xcite this was corrected in the second version of @xcite .",
    "finally , in @xcite , we developed a method based on the green s function solution in momentum space , to calculate , numerically and analytically , the production of gravity waves from a stochastic medium of scalar fields in an expanding universe . at present , the numerical methods of different groups @xcite , @xcite and @xcite seem to agree well with each other , see @xcite for a comparison of the results in a model of chaotic inflation .",
    "most of these papers focused on models of preheating based on parametric resonance after chaotic inflation , which leads to gravity wave signals at frequencies which are irrelevant observationally .",
    "models of preheating after hyrbid inflation are observationally much more interesting , because they involve extra parameters and they occur at lower energy scales , and thus they may generate gw with lower frequencies .",
    "gravity wave production after hybrid inflation was first considered in @xcite , extrapolating the results of @xcite , assuming that preheating occurs through parametric resonance .",
    "however , we know since @xcite that preheating after hybrid inflation occurs in the qualitatively different regime of tachyonic amplification due to the dynamical symmetry breaking , when the fields roll towards the minimum through the region where their effective mass is negative  a process called tachyonic preheating .",
    "it completes in one or very few oscillations of the fields and is very different from parametric resonance model of parametric resonance at low energy scales .",
    "however , as noted above , this model is not relevant for preheating after hybrid inflation .",
    "the gravity wave spectra shown in @xcite fall into an observable range for an inflaton mass of order @xmath6 gev , instead of @xmath7 gev in chaotic inflation ( and for a coupling constant of order @xmath8 ) .",
    "one can also consider gw production from the non - perturbative decay of a scalar field @xmath9 in this model not necessarily related to the inflaton , as for example in the scenario considered in @xcite .",
    "the present - day peak frequency @xmath10 may then be estimated , in the same way as we do below , from the typical momentum @xmath11 amplified in this model .",
    "if @xmath9 dominates the energy density before decaying and the decay is followed by the radiation dominated era , one finds @xmath12 , independently of the mass @xmath13 and the initial amplitude @xmath14 of the field @xmath9 ( as long as @xmath15 for preheating to occur ) .",
    "this bound can be relaxed if @xmath9 does not dominate the energy density , but a very small coupling @xmath16 is still required to achieve @xmath17 , a necessary condition for these gw to be observable . ] .    before further discussion on gw",
    ", we have to comment about specific challenges for numerical simulations of tachyonic preheating in hybrid inflation models with several parameters .",
    "these parameters include the self - coupling @xmath18 of the symmetry breaking fields and their coupling @xmath16 to the inflaton .",
    "the scales of the preheating dynamics can be significantly different depending on the combination @xmath19 ( roughly speaking , the ratio of effective masses around the local maximum and minimum of the potential ) .",
    "therefore , care should be taken to incorporate both scales in the simulations .",
    "an additional subtlety is related to the initial conditions for the fields around the bifurcation point , namely , relatively high or low inflaton velocity , which results in qualitatively different initial regimes  quantum diffusion or classical fast or slow rolls around the bifurcation point , see @xcite for details .",
    "the case with higher initial velocity is easier to model numerically .",
    "the production of gravitational waves properly from tachyonic preheating was first investigated in @xcite , for a specific region of the parameter space ( @xmath20 and significant velocity of the inflaton at the bifurcation point ) , where the dynamical scales are of the same order .",
    "the resulting gravity wave spectra were located at frequencies too high to be observable , as in chaotic inflation models .",
    "@xcite also displayed a conjecture for a low frequency spectrum , but the dependence on the parameters was not studied , so it remains unclear which model , if any , could lead to an observable signal . in @xcite ,",
    "it was conjectured that the peak frequency and amplitude of the gravity wave spectrum depends in a relatively simple way on the typical scale amplified during preheating , which is usually a known function of the parameters . in @xcite",
    "we verified this conjecture numerically for a model of chaotic inflation , and used it to estimate analytically the peak of the gravity wave spectrum produced in two different models of preheating after hybrid inflation .",
    "in particular , we noticed that models with low velocity of the inflaton at the critical point are observationally more promising , but it is also more challeging to model this case with numerical simulations , as noted above .    in the present paper , we investigate in detail gravity waves produced from preheating after hybrid inflation , focusing in particular on their dependence on various model parameters such as @xmath19 and the field velocities around the bifurcation point .",
    "we study gw production in several qualitatively different settings of tachyonic preheating , some of which , including the most interesting cases , were completely missed in the literature .",
    "we use a combination of analytical estimates and improved numerical simulations to compute the resulting gravity wave spectra and to identify the regions of the parameter space which may be relevant for upcoming gravity wave experiments .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we briefly review the hybrid inflation models that we will consider . in section [ analytics ] ,",
    "we identify three qualitatively different dynamical regimes of preheating in these models and we make analytical estimates of the resulting gravity wave spectra . in section [ gwcalculations ]",
    "we describe and advance further our numerical method for calculating gravity wave production from preheating .",
    "we apply this method to preheating after hybrid inflation in section [ numerics ] and we study the dependence of the gravity wave amplitudes and frequencies on the parameters of the model .",
    "we then discuss which regions of the parameter space may lead to a detectable signal .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of our results and directions for future work .",
    "some details of our numerical calculations are given in the appendices .",
    "we will consider simple hybrid inflation models with the potential @xmath21 the higgs field @xmath22 may in principle be real , complex , or consisting of any number of components , but the case of a real field is ruled out because it would lead to the production of dangerous sub - horizon size domain walls .",
    "we have tried simulations with varying numbers of @xmath22 components and found the results to be largely unaffected .",
    "the simulations shown below are for a two - component @xmath22 , for which @xmath23 should be understood as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are two real scalar fields .",
    "we take the inflaton @xmath9 to be real for simplicity .    for @xmath27 , where [ defphic ] _",
    "c v is the critical point , the fields have positive mass squared and the potential has a valley at @xmath28 .",
    "inflation occurs while @xmath9 decreases slowly in this valley due to the uplifting term @xmath29 in ( [ hybrid ] ) .",
    "the energy density is usually dominated by the false vacuum contribution , @xmath30 .",
    "inflation ends either at the bifurcation point when @xmath31 or when the slow - roll conditions are violated , whichever occurs first . in both cases ,",
    "when @xmath31 , @xmath22 acquires a tachyonic mass and the fields roll rapidly towards the true minimum at @xmath32 , @xmath33 . during this rolling field fluctuations are exponentially excited by tachyonic preheating @xcite , thus leading to a rapid decay of the homogeneous field energy , see fig .",

    "we see that the prediction ( [ fstarg ] ) , @xmath38 , is very well satisfied .",
    "the peak amplitude grows slightly more rapidly than ( [ omegastarg ] ) when @xmath39 decreases , @xmath40 .",
    "finally , @xmath34 grows slightly more rapidly than @xmath41 , @xmath42 . in these fits , we disregarded the point at the extreme right ( @xmath43 ) , which is slightly displaced compared to the others .",
    "in fact , for @xmath44 , and for the initial velocity @xmath35 considered here , the inflaton reached @xmath45 and spent most of the time in these regions .",
    "indeed , in these regions , the minimum in the @xmath22-direction is at @xmath28 and the effective mass for @xmath9 is very low , @xmath46 .",
    "apparently , this slightly increases the peak amplitude and decreases the peak frequency .",
    "however , it may not be a good approximation to neglect @xmath29 in the region where @xmath47 . also , we decreased @xmath39 while keeping @xmath48 fixed .",
    "however , for a given physical initial velocity @xmath49 , decreasing @xmath19 decreases the unitless velocity @xmath50 , see ( [ defvc ] ) . for sufficiently small @xmath50 ,",
    "the inflaton will not reach values @xmath47 .",
    "we will thus neglect this effect below , although it may be useful to further decrease the peak frequency .",

    "in this paper , we studied the stochastic background of gravitational waves produced from tachonic preheating after hybrid inflation in the very early universe .",
    "the present - day frequencies and amplitudes of these gravity waves may cover a wide range of values , depending on the main phenomenological parameters introduced in section ii : the vev @xmath58 and self - coupling @xmath18 of the symmetry breaking fields , their coupling to the inflaton @xmath16 and the ( unitless ) initial velocity of the inflaton at the critical point @xmath48 .",
    "we developed analytical and numerical tools to calculate the resulting gw spectra and to study in detail how they depend on these parameters .",

    "first , if the field @xmath22 in the model ( [ hybrid ] ) corresponds to a flat direction , we may expect its negative mass squared at the origin to be of the order @xmath86 , and the true minimum of the potential to be located at a vev at a much higher scale , as high as @xmath87 .",

    "we found that the gravity wave spectrum is highly sensitive to the uv and ir tails . when the lattice has insufficient uv coverage this results in a large , spurious growth in the uv part of the spectrum .",
    "this growth can in turn raise or lower the rest of the spectrum , leading to a generally unreliable spectrum .",
