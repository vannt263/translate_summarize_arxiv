    "lattice models of correlated electrons such as the single - band hubbard model @xcite represent one of the central issues in solid - state theory .",
    "one reason for this strong interest is that the hubbard model is one of the simplest but non - trivial models that allow for a benchmarking of new theoretical concepts . in the recent years",
    ", dynamical cluster approaches to the hubbard model and its variants have become more and more popular @xcite .",
    "contrary to techniques that are based on the ritz variational principle and on the optimization of wave functions , _ dynamical _ cluster concepts not only give information on the static thermodynamic properties of a system but also on the elementary single - particle excitations .",
    "these approaches can be divided into two groups : ( i ) cluster extensions of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite and ( ii ) variational cluster extensions of the simple hubbard - i approximation @xcite .",
    "the dmft can be understood as a mean - field theory which neglects spatial correlations but which fully takes into account temporal fluctuations .",
    "this is reflected in the dmft approximation for the self - energy @xmath1 which is local in the site indices @xmath2 but shows up a non - trivial and in general strong dependence on the excitation energy @xmath3 .",
    "spatial correlations are systematically restored in the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) @xcite or in the cellular dmft ( c - dmft ) @xcite .",
    "contrary to the original dmft , where the self - energy is generated from a model where a single correlated site is embedded into a continuous non - interacting medium ( `` bath '' ) , the cluster extensions employ more complicated reference systems where the single - site impurity is replaced by a cluster of @xmath4 correlated sites .",
    "this generates self - energies with off - site elements .",
    "the bath parameters are determined by a so - called self - consistency equation which relates the reference ( impurity / cluster ) model with the original ( hubbard ) model .",
    "the hubbard - i approximation represents a very simple approximation scheme which originally was constructed @xcite by a more or less _ ad hoc _ decoupling of the equations of motion for the one - particle green s function .",
    "equivalently , however , it can be understood as a scheme which approximates the self - energy of the original hubbard model by the self - energy of an atomic model consisting of a single correlated site ( @xmath5 ) . from this perspective , a cluster generalization is straightforward and yields the cluster - perturbation theory ( cpt ) @xcite .",
    "the cpt can also be considered as the first non - trivial order in a systematic expansion in powers of the inter - cluster hopping parameters .",
    "the usual cpt uses a cluster of finite size @xmath4 which is cut out of the original lattice to generate the approximate self - energy .",
    "the main idea of the variational cpt ( v - cpt ) @xcite is to optimize the self - energy by varying the parameters of the cluster .",

    "consider then a partitioning of the lattice into disconnected clusters with a finite number @xmath13 of correlated sites ( and possibly also a number of @xmath14 additional uncorrelated bath sites attached to each of the correlated sites ) .",
    "the model on the truncated lattice ( the `` reference system '' ) is therefore given by modified one - particle parameters @xmath15 and serves to define trial self - energies @xmath16 for the variational principle .",
    "the trial self - energy is varied by varying the one - particle parameters of the reference system @xmath15 . in this way",

    "approximations constructed in this way are dynamic and thermodynamically consistent in general : via the self - energy at the stationary point , they provide information on the one - particle excitations and an explicit , though approximate , expression for a thermodynamic potential from which all static quantities of interest can be derived .",

    "( ii ) if this is the case , which one is to be preferred ? ( iii ) comparing two different approximations resulting from two different choices of the reference system , which one is more reliable ?    these are questions that refer quite generally to any variational principle that does not share with the ritz principle the `` upper - bound property '' .",

    "this means that despite the fact that the complexity of the reference systems increases , the stationary point with the lowest sft grand potential could be a trivial stationary point , i.e.  could be associated with a very simple reference system only ( like @xmath186 or @xmath187 , for example ) .",
    "such an approximation must be considered as poor since the exact conditional equation for the self - energy is projected onto a very low - dimensional space only .",
    "therefore , one has to construct a different strategy which necessarily approaches the exact solution when following up a systematic sequence of reference systems .",
    "clearly , this can only be achieved if the following rule is obeyed :    * a non - trivial stationary point is always preferred as compared to a trivial one ( r0 ) .    a non - trivial stationary point at a certain level of approximation ,",
    "i.e.  for a given reference system becomes a trivial stationary point on the next level , i.e.in the context of a `` new '' reference system that couples at least two different units of the `` old '' reference system .",
    "hence , by construction , the rule r0 implies that the exact result is approached for a systematic series of reference systems .     as a function of a variational parameter @xmath202 which is assumed to couple two different subsystems of the reference system",
    ", i.e.@xmath203 corresponds to the decoupled case and ( according to the theorem of sec .",
    "[ sec : theorem ] ) must always represent a ( `` trivial '' ) stationary point .",
    "circles show the stationary points to be considered . according to r1 , the trivial stationary point @xmath203 has to be disregarded in all cases except for a ) .",
    "the arrow marks the respective optimum stationary point .",
    "note that in case c ) the sft grand potential is higher for the non - trivial as compared to the trivial stationary point . in case",
    "d ) the rule r2 applies . ,",
    "scaledwidth=95.0% ]    following the rule ( r0 ) , however , may lead to inconsistent thermodynamic interpretations for the case that a trivial stationary point has a lower grand potential as the non - trivial one . to avoid this ,",
    "another rule is necessary :    * trivial stationary points have to be disregarded completely unless there is no non - trivial one ( r1 ) .",
    "this automatically ensures that there is at least one stationary point for any reference system , i.e.  there is at least one solution at any level of the approximation .",
    "clearly , r1 makes r0 superfluous .    to maintain a thermodynamically consistent picture in case that there are more than a single _ non - trivial _ stationary points",
    ", one needs the following rule :    * among two non - trivial stationary points for the same reference system , the one with lower grand potential has to be preferred ( r2 ) .",
    "the rules are illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : om ] which gives different examples .",
    "note that the grand potential away from a stationary point does not have a direct physical interpretation .",
    "hence , there is no reason to interprete the solution corresponding to the maximum in fig .",
    "[ fig : om ] , c ) as `` locally unstable '' .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see figs",
    ".  2 and 4 therein ) nicely demonstrate that with the suggested strategy ( r1 , r2 ) one can consistently describe continuous as well as discontinuous phase transitions .",
    "it should be stressed that the above rules r1 and r2 are unambiguously prescribed by the general demands for the possibility of systematic improvement and for thermodynamic consistency .",
    "there is no acceptable alternative to this strategy .",
    "note that the strategy reduces to the standard strategy ( always taking the solution with lowest grand potential or , for @xmath204 , the lowest ground - state energy ) in case of the ritz variational principle because here a non - trivial stationary point does always have a lower grand potential as compared to a trivial one .",
    "there are also some consequences of the strategy which might be considered as disadvantageous but must be tolerated : ( i ) for a sequence of stationary points that are determined by r1 and r2 from a systematic sequence of reference systems , the corresponding sequence of sft grand potentials necessarily converges to the exact grand potential but not necessarily in a monotonous way .",
    "for example , the exact grand potential might be approached from below or in an oscillatory way .",
    "( ii ) given two different approximations specified by two different reference systems , it is not possible to decide which one should be regarded as superior unless both reference systems belong to the same systematic sequence of reference systems . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ref ] , for example , one has @xmath205 where `` @xmath206 '' stands for `` is inferior compared to '' .",
    "furthermore , @xmath207 and @xmath208 but there is no relation between @xmath187 and @xmath189 , for example .",
    "a dynamical variational principle is a principle of the form @xmath209 = 0 $ ] where @xmath210 is a thermodynamic potential and @xmath211 is a dynamical quantity that refers to excitations of the system out of equilibrium but in the linear - response regime .",
    "a common characteristic of the different dynamical variational principles used in solid - state theory @xcite is that stationary points are saddle points rather than minima in general and that the thermodynamic potential at a stationary point can not serve as an upper bound of the true potential .",
    "one of the most famous approximations that can be constructed in this context is the dynamical mean - field theory and , in fact , there is no general proof ( for finite - dimensional lattice models ) that @xmath212 so far .",
    "having these problems in mind , it becomes questionable how to judge on the _ relative _ quality of two different approximations resulting from two different stationary points of a dynamical variational principle .",
    "it has been shown here that at least within the context of the self - energy - functional theory there is an answer to this question which is prescribed by demanding approximations to be thermodynamically consistent as well as systematic and which is summarized by the rules r1 and r2 in sec .",
    "[ sec : hier ] .",
    "it has turned out that the intuitive strategy of _ always _ preferring the stationary point with the lowest sft grand potential is unsystematic and therefore unacceptable .",
    "the essence of the correct strategy , on the other hand , is to disregard , as far as possible , those stationary points that ( at a certain level of the approximation ) are trivially induced due to a partitioning of the reference system into subsystems with fully decoupled degrees of freedom ."
