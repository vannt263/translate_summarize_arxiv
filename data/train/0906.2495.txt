    "some time after the epoch of cosmic recombination at redshift @xmath8 , the bulk of the intergalactic gas in the universe must have been somehow reionized by @xmath9 , as indicated observationally from the spectra of high-@xmath2 qsos and the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . however , the sources , history and nature of this cosmic reionization process are still largely unknown , as most of this redshift range has yet to be explored through direct observations . because the first stars and galaxies in the universe must have formed during this period , the primary suspect is photoionization by uv radiation from such objects , potentially involving metal - free , population ( pop ) iii stars .",
    "alternative possibilities include mini - quasars , supernova remnants and dark matter decay .",
    "besides providing us with clues to such processes in the early universe , cosmic reionization also profoundly affects the ensuing formation of stars and galaxies , so elucidating this era is one of the most pressing issues in cosmology today ( see barkana & loeb 2001 ; ciardi & ferrara 2005 ; fan et al .",
    "2006 , choudhury 2009 for reviews ) .    in the majority of scenarios for reionization of hydrogen in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , the main protagonists are uv photons with energies above the lyman edge ( @xmath10 ev ) .",
    "although those with lower energies do not contribute to photoionization , they are also crucial since i ) they give indications as to the strength and nature of the ionizing radiation , ii ) those in the lyman - werner band ( @xmath11 ev ) can photodissociate @xmath12 molecules and suppress early star formation ( e.g. ciardi & ferrara 2005 ) , and iii ) ly@xmath13 photons ( @xmath14 ev ) can strongly affect the hi spin temperature and the associated cosmological 21 cm signatures ( e.g. furlanetto et al .",
    "thus , having some observational means to probe the evolution of uv intergalactic radiation fields ( irfs ) , here we avoid the term `` background '' , since irfs can be highly inhomogeneous in the reionization era , especially for @xmath15 , even though it turns out to be more or less uniform for the spectral regime relevant to @xmath0 absorption ; see below . ] in the cosmic reionization era would be of paramount importance , complementing existing observations that probe the neutral or ionized gaseous components of the igm .",
    "however , direct detection of this diffuse emission from very high @xmath2 is extremely difficult if not impossible .",
    "an indirect but powerful means of probing diffuse radiation fields is through photon - photon ( @xmath0 ) absorption of high - energy gamma - rays ( e.g. gould & schreder 1967 ; stecker et al .",
    "gamma - rays with energy @xmath16 emitted from extragalactic sources will be absorbed during intergalactic propagation by interacting with photons of the diffuse radiation field with energy @xmath17 to produce electron - positron pairs ( @xmath18 ) , as long as there is sufficient opacity for energies satisfying the threshold condition @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the incidence angle of the two photons .",
    "the observed spectra of the gamma - ray sources should then exbihit corresponding attenuation features , from which one can effectively infer or limit the properties of the diffuse radiation .",
    "this method has been utilized in recent tev observations of blazars by ground - based cherenkov telescopes to set important constraints on the extragalactic background light in the near infrared to optical bands at relatively low @xmath2 ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006 ; albert et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "as first discussed by oh ( 2001 ; see also rhoads 2001 ) , uv irfs with sufficient intensities to cause igm reionization are also likely to induce significant @xmath0 absorption in gamma - ray sources at @xmath21 at observed energies in the range of a few to tens of gev .",
    "however , these estimates i ) were made before _ wmap _",
    "observations indicating an early start of reionization and were limited to @xmath22 , and ii ) did not include the possibility of metal - free pop iii stars , which may have been active during the first epochs of star formation and are more prodigious uv emitters compared to normal stars .",
    "absorption measurements in low-@xmath2 blazars have set strong constraints against a large contribution from pop iii stars to the local near - ir background ( aharonian et al .",
    "2006 ; see also raue et al .",
    "the recent launch of the _ fermi _ satellite with the large area telescope ( lat ) operating in the @xmath23 gev domain motivates us to reevaluate the @xmath0 absorption opacity at very high @xmath2 , incorporating more recent observational and theoretical developments concerning the cosmic reionization era .",
    "for this purpose , we employ updated versions of the semi - analytical models of choudhury & ferrara ( 2005 ; 2006 ) , which self - consistently describe inhomogeneous reionization of the igm , accounting for both pop ii and pop iii stars and their radiative and chemical feedback effects . with only a few free parameters , they are able to fit a wide variety of high-@xmath2 observational data . using the evolving irfs as predicted by these models , the @xmath0 opacity is evaluated for the redshift range @xmath24 .",
    "we also briefly assess the detectability of the resultant absorption features in high-@xmath2 sources such as blazars or gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with current and future gamma - ray facilities , and the consequent implications .",
    "the salient features of our semi - analytical models are as follows ( see choudhury & ferrara 2005 ; 2006 ; 2007 ; choudhury et al . 2008 ; choudhury 2009 for more details ) : ( 1 ) adopting a lognormal distribution of igm inhomogeneities ( miralda - escud et al .",
    "2000 ) , the ionization and thermal histories of the neutral , hii and heii phases of the igm are tracked simulaneously and self - consistently .",
    "( 2 ) the formation and evolution of dark matter halos are described by a press - schechter - based approach .",
    "( 3 ) three types of radiation sources are considered : a ) metal - free pop iii stars with a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) in the mass range @xmath25 , with spectra according to schaerer ( 2002 ) and including nebular and ly@xmath13 emission lines ( see salvaterra & ferrara 2003 ) ; b ) low - metallicity ( @xmath26 ) pop ii stars with spectra according to bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) , otherwise being the same as pop iii ; and c ) qsos with power - law spectra and emissivity based on the observed luminosity function at @xmath27 , considering only those above the break luminosity ( choudhury et al .",
    "( 4 ) pop ii and pop iii stars each form from gas in virialized halos with efficiencies @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , and the corresponding escape fractions of ionizing photons from the host halos are parameterized by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "included self - consistently are the consequent effects of radiative feedback that suppresses star formation in sufficiently small halos , as well as a `` genetic '' merger - tree - based treatment of chemical feedback that induces the transition from pop iii to pop ii star formation ( schneider et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the free parameters of the model are @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath32 , which fixes both @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and @xmath33 , related to the mean free path of ionizing photons due to hi in high - density regions . , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( spergel et al .",
    "these are ascertained so as to simultaneously reproduce a large set of high-@xmath2 observational data : i ) redshift evolution of lyman - limit absorption systems ; ii ) effective optical depths of the igm for ly@xmath13 and ly@xmath40 from qso spectra ; iii ) electron scattering optical depth @xmath41 from _ wmap _ 3rd year results ( spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) ; , consistent with the 5th year results as well ( dunkley et al . 2009 ) . ]",
    "iv ) temperature of the mean igm ; v ) cosmic star formation history ; and vi ) limits on j - band source counts from nicmos hudf . in the fiducial , best - fit model , , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . ]",
    "h reionization begins rapidly at @xmath45 , initially driven by pop iii stars , and is 90 % complete by @xmath46 .",
    "thereafter it is slowed down by feedback effects and taken over by pop ii stars at @xmath47 , finally reaching completion by @xmath9 ( see fig.2 of choudhury 2009 ) .",
    "the cosmic star formation rate is always dominated by pop ii stars and is at the level of @xmath48 for @xmath49 ( fig.2(b ) of choudhury 2009 ) , in line with that deduced from observed grb rates ( e.g. salvaterra et al .",
    "2008 , kistler et al .",
    "2009 ) .    shown in fig.[fig :",
    "bg ] is the volume - averaged intensity of the irf as calculated from this model , which declines monotonically with @xmath2 following the evolution of the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "we caution that at @xmath21 before intergalactic hii regions have completely overlapped , the irf is expected to be inhomogeneous and fluctuating along different lines of sight , particularly strongly for @xmath15 .",
    "however , it is also evident that ionizing photons are strongly absorbed by the neutral igm and the mean irf spectrum cuts off very sharply above @xmath50 , so that this portion has negligible effects on the @xmath0 opacity ( madau & phinney 1996 , oh 2001 , rhoads 2001 ) . on the other hand , uv radiation with @xmath51",
    "have much longer mean free paths in the igm , and the notion of a nearly uniform and isotropic background may still be appropriate for this regime , which is also the most relevant for @xmath0 absorption .",
    "of particular note is the band @xmath52 ev where the spectrum dips somewhat due to blanketing by the lyman series lines , but which should nevertheless be very important for the @xmath0 opacity .",
    "being optimized for the cosmic reionization era , the main shortcoming of the present model is that it does not account for pop i stars or dust that can become important at lower @xmath2 .",
    "our irf calculations are available only for @xmath53 , and may be somewhat less reliable near @xmath54 as the comparison with observations has not been as thorough as for @xmath55 .",
    "a more complete model describing the evolution of the irf at all redshifts awaits future studies .",
    "we first estimate the `` local @xmath0 optical depth '' at each @xmath2 by the optical depth across a hubble radius @xmath56 ,    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the irf photon number density per energy interval , @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the threshold energy , and @xmath61 is the @xmath0 pair production cross section . for given @xmath16",
    ", @xmath62 rises sharply from @xmath63 , peaks at @xmath64 , and then falls off as @xmath65 .",
    "thus @xmath66 roughly mirrors the irf spectrum at each @xmath2 , although its detailed features are smeared out .",
    "displayed in fig.[fig : tauloc ] in terms of the rest - frame gamma - ray energy @xmath67 , we see that the opacity may be significant out to @xmath68 for @xmath69 gev .",
    "tev , but is irrelevant for our results below and not plotted in fig.[fig : tauloc ] . ] note the steep drop in @xmath66 at @xmath70 18 gev , corresponding to the sharp cutoff in the irf spectrum above the lyman edge . as pointed out by oh ( 2001 ; see also rhoads 2001 ) , this is crucial in that it allows appreciable contributions to the total @xmath0 opacity from higher @xmath2 even when the irf intensity is relatively weaker , and which should be uncontaminated from absorption at lower @xmath2 .",
    "however , we also see that due to the declining irf intensity together with the reduced path length , the opacity from @xmath71 is likely to be quite small .",
    "this can be seen more explicitly in fig.[fig : taudet ] where we show the integrated @xmath0 optical depths for different source redshifts @xmath2 , @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath16 is the observed gamma - ray energy at @xmath74 . as mentioned above ,",
    "the lower limit of @xmath2-integration that can be taken in our model is @xmath75 ; for additional absorption from the range @xmath76 , we can only consult other models at the moment ( e.g. kneiske et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter k04 ; stecker et al . 2006 ; razzaque et al . 2009",
    "; gilmore et al .",
    "overlayed here for comparison is k04 s `` high stellar uv model '' , which gives their best description of qso proximity effect measurements at @xmath77 .    as we could infer from fig.[fig : tauloc ] , our model predicts appreciable opacity at observed energies @xmath78 gev for sources at @xmath79 , with notable differences out to @xmath46 .",
    "however , the relative effects of further absorption from @xmath80 may be practically indiscernible .",
    "nevertheless , the spectral attenuation feature itself should be observable in high-@xmath2 gamma - ray sources by current or future gamma - ray facilities , and possibly distinguishable in the range @xmath81 for sufficiently bright objects (  [ sec : detect ] ) .",
    "owing to the drop in @xmath0 opacity at @xmath82 gev ( fig.[fig : tauloc ] ) , the differences in absorption in this @xmath2 range are caused in - situ by the evolution of uv irfs just below the lyman edge energy , including the crucial ly@xmath13 and lyman - werner bands .",
    "we also recall that in this model , pop iii stars continued to be significant contributors to the uv irf down to @xmath47 , where they are comparable with pop ii stars for ionizing photons . measurements of these effects would thus provide an important check of current models of cosmic reionization in its latter stages , as well as a unique and invaluable probe of evolving uv irfs in the sub - lyman edge regime during the era of early star formation (  [ sec : detect ] ) .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : expdet_com ] and [ fig : etau1_com ] , respectively , we plot the spectral attenuation factor @xmath83 $ ] and the observed energy @xmath84 where the optical depth is unity . here",
    "the fiducial results are compared with those of an alternative model and @xmath85 .",
    "the model gives @xmath86 , marginally consistent with the 5th year _",
    "wmap _ constraints . ] that does not include pop iii stars , in which reionization is driven only by pop ii stars and occurs relatively late at @xmath9 ( similar to the late reionization model of gallerani et al .",
    "the fact that pop ii stars are less efficient sources of ionizing photons compared to pop iii stars mandates a larger sfr , more intense irf for @xmath51 and hence larger @xmath0 opacity .",
    "however , since the sfr at @xmath87 is observationally constrained , notable differences appear only at @xmath80 , which should be challenging to distinguish in practice . thus gamma - ray absorption may not be a sensitive probe of the reionization history itself .",
    "we have also investigated various other models , e.g. those with more realistic prescriptions for radiative feedback that fit the current high-@xmath2 observations nearly equally well , and found that they generally do not lead to large differences .",
    "conversely , being constrained by existing data , our predictions may be considered reasonably robust , at least within the framework of our model .",
    "nevertheless , we caution that relaxing some of the present assumptions , e.g. regarding the stellar imf or the qso contribution , may yet allow a wider range of possibilities .",
    "note that although some other recent models ( e.g. razzaque et al . 2009 , gilmore et al . 2009 ) predict somewhat less absorption at @xmath88 , they are not directly comparable with ours as their focus is on the @xmath27 universe ( e.g. gilmore et al .",
    "2009 do not attempt to fit the ly@xmath13 effective optical depths at @xmath89 as we do ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath0 absorption is sensitive to photons with energies below the lyman limit rather than the ionizing radiation (  [ sec : model ] ) actually points to a unique probe of the cosmic reionization epoch that complements measurements of qso gunn - peterson troughs or cmb polarization anisotropies , which probe the neutral and ionized components of the igm , respectively . on the one hand , observationally deducing the global uv emissivity and hence the cosmic star formation rate from the latter two is problematic due to uncertainties in the inhomogeneity of the igm ( clumping factor ) and the escape fraction of ionizing photons from the host galaxies ( madau et al .",
    "1999 , wyithe et al .",
    "2009 ) . on the other , the direct census of the high-@xmath2 uv luminosity density from deep ,",
    "near - ir surveys are affected by the uncertain integrated contribution of faint galaxies below the telescope detection limit ( e.g. bouwens et al . 2007 ) . observing @xmath0 absorption in high-@xmath2 sources may allow more robust measurements of the evolution of the cosmic uv emissivity , and in combination with other data , possibly the determination of the escape fraction and/or the igm clumping factor as well .",
    "these inferences are general and independent of any particular model for reionization , but will be investigated in more quantitative detail in the near future .",
    "likewise , the implications for constraining ly@xmath13 or @xmath12-dissociating radiation from @xmath0 absorption will be discussed in future work .",
    "we now briefly address whether the effects discussed above are observable in real sources with current or future gamma - ray instruments . for blazars ,",
    "the most prominent and numerous extragalactic sources of gev gamma - rays , the highest redshift confirmed so far is @xmath90 ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ; abdo et al .",
    "however , objects similar to the most powerful known blazars such as 3c454.3 with apparent luminosities @xmath91 should be detectable by _ fermi _ out to @xmath92 if they exist at such redshifts ( e.g. romani et al . 2004 ) . according to the latest blazar evolution models ( inoue & totani 2009 )",
    ", it may be plausible for _ fermi _ to detect some blazars above @xmath9 during its survey period , for which deep , pointed observations may indeed reveal the irf absorption features described above .",
    "grbs are also promising as they are known to occur at @xmath93 ( kawai et al .",
    "2005 ; greiner et al . 2009 ) , at least up to @xmath94 ( tanvir et al . 2009 ; salvaterra et al . 2009 ) , and perhaps out to the very first epochs of star formation in the universe ( e.g. bromm & loeb 2006 ; salvaterra et al . 2008 ) .",
    "although the spectral properties of grbs in the gev domain are still rather uncertain , previous detections by cgro / egret ( hurley et al .",
    "1994 ) and the recent detection of grb 080916c at @xmath95 by _ fermi _ ( abdo et al . 2009a ) and @xmath96 gev , our fiducial model gives @xmath97 , consistent with the actual detection of a photon at this energy from grb 080916c .",
    "] demonstrate that at least some grbs have luminous emission extending to @xmath9810 gev , which can also be expected theoretically ( e.g. zhang & meszaros 2001 ; asano et al .",
    "a burst similar to grb 080916c may still be detectable at several gev by _",
    "fermi_/lat at @xmath99 , and even out to higher @xmath2 if the spectrum was somewhat harder .",
    "even better for this purpose would be proposed ground - based telescopes with much larger effective area and multi - gev energy threshold , such as the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) , advanced gamma - ray imaging system ( agis ) or the 5@5 array ( aharonian et al .",
    "together with measurements of ly@xmath13 damping wings ( mcquinn et al . 2009 ) and possibly radio dispersion ( ioka 2003 ; inoue 2004 ) , future , broadband observations of very high-@xmath2 grbs should open new windows onto the cosmic reionization epoch .",
    "even if irf - induced spectral features are detected , a generic problem for @xmath0 absorption studies is distinguishing them from spectral cutoffs intrinsic to the source . in this",
    "regard , spectral variability should offer an important clue .",
    "both blazars and grbs are highly variable gamma - ray emitters , and in general , changes in physical conditions of the source that cause variations in flux should also be accompanied by variations of the intrinsic cutoff energy , whether it is due to injection of freshly accelerated particles , changes in the magnetic fields , internal radiation fields , bulk flow velocity , etc .",
    "in contrast , cutoffs of irf origin should be stable in time and independent of the variability state of each object .",
    "acquisition of time - resolved spectra should thus allow the deconvolution of the two effects .",
    "another indication should come from statistical studies of a sufficient sample of measurements .",
    "irf - related cutoffs should occur at similar energies for sources at similar @xmath2 , and also exhibit a systematic evolution toward lower energies for higher @xmath2 , whereas there is no strong reason to expect such trends for intrinsic cutoffs .",
    "both the above strategies motivate the construction of future , high - sensitivity multi - gev facilities such as cta , agis and 5@5 , which should be powerful tools to probe the evolution of uv irfs in the cosmic reionization era through @xmath0 absorption in very high-@xmath2 sources .",
