    "the interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom in a 2d doped mott insulator represents an important problem in condensed matter physics.@xcite the strong constraint on the double occupancy gives rise to the non trivial coupling of the charge motion with the magnetic background . within the context of the @xmath2 model , shraiman and",
    "siggia@xcite showed that hole motion produces a long range dipolar distortion of the staggered magnetization resulting in a spiral order characterized by a pitch proportional to hole doping .",
    "further studies focused on the spiral stability under low doping@xcite and its possible relation with the spin glass behavior found in the superconducting cuprates . regarding the charge degrees of freedom , it was suggested that already for the one hole case such a distorsion of the magnetic background would lead to an orthogonality catastrophe,@xcite signalled by the vanishing of the quasiparticle weight @xmath3 .",
    "subsequent works,@xcite however , showed that such a dipolar distorsion could be compatible with the spin polaron picture where @xmath4 for the whole brillouin zone ( bz ) .    in frustrated mott insulators the single hole dynamics can change drastically .",
    "that is the case for the @xmath5 nel order of the triangular antiferromagnet ( af)@xcite where the spin polaron picture is not valid for an ample region of the bz ; while for the kagom af , whose magnetic ground state is disordered , the hole spectral functions seem to be completely incoherent@xcite for the whole bz .",
    "therefore , the coupling of the hole with the underlying spin excitations is crucial . in the former case ,",
    "the hole couples with the magnons above the @xmath5 spiralling magnetization ; while in the latter case it couples with an exponentially large number of singlets inside a triplet gap.@xcite    a hole can also couple with more exotic magnetic excitations like deconfined spin-@xmath6 spinons .",
    "the deconfined scenario , based on effective fields theories , was originally proposed in the presence of short range spiral correlation@xcite and , later , in the quantum critical point between nel and valence bond solid phases.@xcite given that these magnetic correlations are present in the af @xmath7 heisenberg model it is believed that it is an appropriated microscopic model for the search of deconfined spinons.@xcite recently , it was hypothesized that by coupling a non magnetic vacancy to the magnetic fluctuations of the above disordered regimes , in particular the plaquette ones , the strong reduction of the vacancy quasiparticle weight would give a measure of the degree of spinon deconfinement.@xcite even if the idea seems to be appealing the qp weight reduction can be interpreted within a more conventional scenario.@xcite    very recently , the phase diagram of the @xmath8 model was studied exhaustively with functional renormalization group , coupled cluster method , and series expansion@xcite .",

    "in fact , a classical spiral @xmath19 is related to @xmath44 and @xmath45 by a global rotation combined with a reflexion about @xmath46 and @xmath47 axis , respectively.@xcite higher orders beyond linear spin wave theory will lift these degeneracies,@xcite nevertheless for our purpose it is enough to keep up to quadratic order since the main effects on the hole dynamics will be related to the non - collinearity of the magnetic background signalled by the spiral pitch @xmath30 ( see below ) .",
    "the dynamics of a hole coupled with the magnetic excitations of a mott insulator is properly described by the @xmath2 model@xcite defined as    @xmath48    where the electronic operators are the projected ones , @xmath49 that obey the no double occupancy constraint , and in our present case @xmath27 is eq .",

    "( [ effham ] ) vanishes and it is widely accepted the spin polaron picture,@xcite where the qp excitations are identified with the coherent propagation of the hole with the magnetic disturbance ( magnon cloud ) . for spiral phases , instead , the free hopping processes interfere with the magnon assisted ones .",
    "in particular , we will show that the interference depends strongly on the spiral pitch @xmath30 , which for certain values of frustration leads to the vanishing of @xmath3 . regarding the hole - magnon vertex it is interesting to note that while for the nel phase @xmath57 vanishes at @xmath58 and @xmath59 for spiral phases it behaves as    @xmath60^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\sum_{r>0}t_r \\ ; ( { \\bf q}\\cdot { \\bf r})\\;\\sin \\frac{{\\bf q}.{\\bf r}}{2}\\;\\cos { { \\bf k}\\cdot { \\bf r}}\\ ] ]    @xmath61^{\\frac{1}{2 } } \\sum_{r>0}t_r \\sin { \\bf q}.{\\bf r}\\;\\sin ( { \\bf k}-\\frac{\\bf q}{2})\\cdot{\\bf r}\\ ] ]    for small @xmath62 .",

    "in this subsection we compare the hole spectral functions predicted by the scba and exact diagonalization on a cluster size of @xmath74 sites . for collinear phases , @xmath75 and @xmath21 ,",
    "we have already confirmed in a previous work a very good agreement between both techniques for the hole dynamics in the context of the @xmath26 model.@xcite here we are interested in frustration values that induce spiral correlations . in previous exact studies of the @xmath76 model@xcite",
    "it has been shown a coexistence of spiral and plaquette fluctuations which , in principle , would couple with the hole .",
    "therefore , a careful comparison of the exact hole spectral functions with that of the scba would allow us to discern the relevance , or not , of the spiral fluctuations .",
    "it is worth to stress that for finite systems the parameter space is restricted to frustration values that give rise to spiral pitchs coincident with the momenta of the @xmath74 bz . even in this case , the strong finite size quantum fluctuations renormalize the classical magnetic wave vector @xmath77 .",

    "it can be seen that the agreement is reasonably good . in particular , when the magnetic structure factor is characterized by only one main peak like that at @xmath84 ( see upper panels of fig .",
    "2 ) the agreement is quite good , in contrast to the case of two peaks ( see @xmath85 and @xmath86 at lower panels of fig .",
    "the latter is related to the strong competence of spiral and nel fluctuations for this regime ; however in the scba only the main spiral peak at momentum @xmath85 is considered .",
    "given that the exact results incorpore all kind of magnetic fluctuations , our results suggest that to describe the main characteristics of the hole spectral function , at least in the regimes considered , it is enough to take into account the coupling of the hole with magnonic excitations above the spiral correlations .",

    "we have computed the hole spectral functions for cluster sizes up to 1600 sites . in complete agreement with previous works we found that for the frustrated nel @xmath18 regime the hole spectral functions show a coherent low energy peak for the whole bz , which is identified with a well defined quasipaticle excitation , _",

    "as frustration increases the magnon dispersion bandwidth decreases , allowing to the hole to emit and absorb magnons more easily.@xcite then , there is an increasing contribution of the multimagnon processes in the spin polaron wave function accompanied by a reduction of the quasiparticle weight .",
    "therefore , as quantum fluctuation are enhanced by frustration the qp weight and the magnetization decrease monotonically .",

    "[ fig3 ] it is shown the peculiar structure of the low energy sector which is composed by several irregular peaks where no signal of qp excitation is present . in the scba",
    "this feature of the hole spectral function is typical for an incommensurate spiral correlations and is related to the fact that there are two mechanisms for hole motion the magnon assisted and the free one whose interference may increase the available phase space for hole scattering , leading to the lost of qp excitations . in fact , this effect depends strongly on the spiral pitch which can be fine tuned by frustration .",
    "for instance , we have found that when the spiral pitch is around @xmath105 ( case @xmath104 of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) the effect is maximum with a vanishing of the qp weight in approximately @xmath106 of the bz . it is worth to stress that here the local magnetization of the spiral state is about @xmath107 so the non trivial hole dynamics is already present at a semiclassical level . we have found a similar behavior for a hole injected in other non - collinear magnetic backgrounds such as the @xmath5 nel order@xcite and canted nel phases,@xcite although the incommensurate spiral correlations seems to be more effective in destroying the qp excitations .",
    "it is worth noting that the strong reduction of the qp weight along with the rapid redistribution of the spectral weight on several mulipoles has been observed previously on finite systems .",
    "alternatively , these features were related to a scenario of spinon deconfinement@xcite which , of course , is out of the scope of our present approximation .",

    "inset : qp weight for @xmath112 computed with the scba ( solid line ) and eq .",
    "( [ zk ] ) ( dashed line).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we have further investigated the effect of spiral fluctuations for the very weak coupling regime ( @xmath113 ) for a nel phase the only mechanism for hole motion is magnon assisted and , owing to its high energy cost , it is expected that the hole reaches a quasi - static regime where the qp weight approaches unity . for spiral phases , however , the hole can move via the free hopping term of eq.([effham ] ) , reducing the qp weight even with a very low average number of magnons promoted .",
    "this can be seen from the approximated expression of @xmath3 for the weak coupling regime,@xcite    @xmath114    in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] it is shown the good agreement between the above expression ( dashed line ) and the qp weight computed with the scba ( solid line ) for different values of frustration . in particular , for the selected hole momentum , @xmath3 is strongly reduced once the magnetic background reaches the spiral regime . in principle , one can attribute the reduced value of @xmath3 for spiral phases to the vertex behavior near @xmath19 , @xmath115 .",
    "nonetheless , we have checked that the most important contribution comes from the small values assumed by the denominators @xmath116 . in order to quantify globally this behavior we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the qp spectral weight averaged on the entire bz , @xmath117 for @xmath108 .",
    "again , it can be observed that as @xmath81 increases @xmath118 decreases notably when the magnetic background reaches the spiral regime .",
    "in particular , for @xmath119 it is always observed a single minimum at @xmath120 , analogously to that found in the strong coupling regime ( fig .",

    "[ fig4 ] ) , @xmath30 occurs in a region where @xmath122 , while for @xmath123 ( dashed line ) @xmath30 is inside the region where @xmath109 . in the latter we have modified the lsw approximation by introducing a gap in the magnetic dispersion in order to describe the short range spiral order properly.@xcite     in the weak coupling regime , ( @xmath108 ) . for the strong coupling regime , @xmath80 ,",
    "the scba predicts the vanishing of @xmath3 in some area of the bz .",
    "@xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we plotted the approximated area of the magnetic phase diagram where the qp weight is strongly reduced , that is , @xmath127 for the very weak coupling regime .",
    "the fact that the shaded area is located at the spiral region of the magnetic phase diagram is a clear indication of the crucial effect of the spiral fluctuation on the hole dynamics . since this is independent of the range of the magnetic fluctuations we expect the same effect for a hole coupled to the short range spiral fluctuation of the actual quantum magnetic phase diagram ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we have investigated the effect of semiclassical spiral fluctuations on a single hole dynamics . based on the magnetic phase diagram of the @xmath128 model and solving the hole green function with exact diagonalization and within the scba",
    ", we found that for the weak ( @xmath113 ) and the strong ( @xmath129 ) coupling regime there is characteristic value of the spiral pitch @xmath130 for which the available phase space for hole scattering is maximum .",
    "notably , for the whole spiral regimes ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) of the model we found a strong reduction of the averaged qp weight @xmath131 . in particular , for some momenta the qp weight vanishes and the spectral weight at low energy is redistributed on several irregular peaks , or multipoles .",
    "even if in our study the spirals have been described semiclassically we think that this effect should be also observed in the short range spirals phases recently found in the disordered regime of the quantum phase diagram.@xcite similar features have been found in finite size studies of the same model , although the strong reduction of the qp weight have been attributed to the spinon deconfinement inherent of the plaquette fluctuations.@xcite based on our results and given that the alternative scenario for spinon deconfinement is based on short range spiral correlations,@xcite it would be important to go beyond the semiclassical description and investigate , within the context of the present model , the hole dynamics on spirals treated in terms of spinon excitations.@xcite work in this direction is in progress .",
