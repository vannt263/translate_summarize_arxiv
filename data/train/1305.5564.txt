    "ever since the discovery of the @xmath1 by the belle collaboration in 2003 @xcite , one of the leading interpretations has been a charm meson molecule whose constituents are a superposition of @xmath13 and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this identification would require the @xmath2 quantum numbers of @xmath1 to be @xmath3 .",
    "the observation of its decay into @xmath17 determined the charge conjugation @xmath18 to be @xmath19 @xcite . in 2006 ,",
    "the cdf collaboration reduced the options for @xmath2 to @xmath3 and @xmath6 by analyzing decays into @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the lhcb collaboration recently ruled out @xmath6 , finally establishing the quantum numbers of @xmath1 as @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the option @xmath6 had been disfavored on various theoretical grounds , especially if the @xmath1 is identified with the @xmath20 charmonium state @xmath21 .",
    "the prediction of the mass of @xmath21 in most potentials models is lower than 3872  mev by 40 to 100  mev @xcite .",
    "the decay of @xmath21 into @xmath17 should have strong multipole suppression @xcite .",
    "the expected production rate for d - wave charmonium in a hadron collider is much smaller than the observed production rate of the @xmath1 at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "the decay of d - wave charmonium into @xmath22 should have angular momentum suppression @xcite . finally , the degree of isospin violation required by the observed branching fraction into @xmath0 is difficult to accommodate for d - wave charmonium @xcite .",
    "all of these problems are solved , or at least ameliorated , if the quantum numbers are @xmath3 .    back in 2010 ,",
    "the babar collaboration analyzed decays of @xmath1 into @xmath12 and concluded that @xmath6 was preferred over @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "they quantified this preference in terms of a probability that was 7.1% for @xmath3 and 61.9% for @xmath6 .",
    "we will point out that a proper quantification of the likelihood for the observed result increases the probability for @xmath3 to 18.7% . with the properly calculated probabilities ,",
    "the preference for @xmath6 over @xmath3 is no longer so significant .",
    "however it is still worth considering whether a more accurate description of the resonance in the @xmath12 channel would be important in the babar analysis or in future analyses .",

    "the proximity of the @xmath9 threshold to the @xmath13 and @xmath14 thresholds and the narrow width of the @xmath11 suggest that the effects of scattering between @xmath9 and charm meson pairs could be significant .",
    "we therefore study the effects of scattering between these coupled channels on the @xmath1 resonance in the @xmath12 channel .",
    "we also analyze the effects of scattering through the @xmath15 charmonium resonance , which has quantum numbers @xmath3 .    in section  [ sec :",
    "widths ] , we introduce our notation for the three coupled channels and for the many masses that are relevant to this problem . in section  [ sec : ddscat ] , we derive the scattering amplitudes due to s - wave scattering between the coupled channels . we use them in section  [ sec : lineshape ] to determine the inclusive line shape of the @xmath1 resonance and its line shape in the @xmath12 channel .",

    "we wish to determine whether the peak in the @xmath199 distribution can be shifted downward by about 10  mev by adjusting these parameters .",
    "we therefore consider @xmath269 in the range between 0 and 10  mev .",
    "for some values of @xmath282 , there is another resonance with energy below @xmath1 , which is inconsistent with observations .",
    "demanding no such resonance constrains @xmath283  mev .",
    "there can also be a substantial enhancement near @xmath284 from a cusp associated with the opening up of the @xmath285 threshold .",
    "this has the opposite effect of the suppression above the threshold that we want . to avoid the enhancement , we require @xmath286 , which combined with eq",
    ".   implies @xmath287  mev or @xmath288  mev .",
    "for the given regions of @xmath269 and @xmath289 , we are unable to obtain a significant shift in the peak of the @xmath199 distribution to lower mass .",
    "another way to suppress the resonance factor for @xmath88 above the @xmath290 threshold is through interference with the low - energy tail of the @xmath15 resonance . the inclusive line shape in the isospin-0 channel is given in eq .",
    "it can be resolved into contributions proportional to the imaginary parts of @xmath72 , @xmath195 , and @xmath127 by using eq .  .",
    "the line shape in the @xmath9 channel can be obtained by replacing the imaginary parts of @xmath72 , @xmath195 , and @xmath127 in eq .",
    "( [ imgammachi ] ) by the contributions to those imaginary parts from the @xmath9 channel , and allowing those imaginary parts to be energy - dependent .",
    "for example , the substitution for im@xmath183 is given in eq .",
    "( [ imgamma0-psiomega ] ) .",
    "if we use the assumption @xmath291 , the substitution for im@xmath183 reduces to @xmath202 multiplied by a constant . the substitutions for @xmath195 and @xmath127 would reduce to similar forms .",
    "the expression in eq .   then reduces to the product of the resonance factor @xmath292 , the threshold factor @xmath202 , and a quadratic function of the energy @xmath88 .",
    "the maximum possible interference effect corresponds to total destructive interference at some energy @xmath269 above the @xmath13 threshold . in this case , the quadratic function of @xmath88 reduces to @xmath293 and the expression in eq .",
    "( [ imgammachi ] ) reduces to @xmath294_{j/\\psi\\ , \\omega } \\longrightarrow\\ ,   \\frac { -\\text{im}\\,\\kappa_{\\psi \\omega } ( e ) }      { |e-\\nu+g^2 \\gamma_0|^2 } \\,\\frac{2\\gamma_x^2}{|\\gamma_v|^2 } \\ , ( e - e_0)^2 , \\label{imgamma0-last}\\ ] ] we vary the position of interference zero by changing @xmath269 between 0 and 10  mev .",
    "we are unable to obtain a significant shift in the peak of the distributions to smaller @xmath199 by tuning the interference position @xmath269 .",
    "we are also unable to obtain a significant shift using zeroes in both the @xmath1 resonance factor @xmath295 and the @xmath15 resonance factor in eq .  .",
    "the quantum numbers of the @xmath1 have been definitely established as @xmath3 from analyses of the @xmath190 decay channel .",
    "this settles an issue raised by a babar analysis of the @xmath199 distribution for the @xmath244 decay channel that preferred @xmath6 over @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we pointed out that in the babar analysis , the quoted values of @xmath7 were not minimized with respect to the adjustable normalizations of the monte carlo distributions .",
    "upon minimization of the @xmath7 , the probability for @xmath3 is increased significantly from 7.1% to 18.7% while the probability for @xmath6 is increased only slightly from 61.9% to 66.2% .",
    "thus the preference for @xmath6 over @xmath3 was overstated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for the benefit of future analyses of the @xmath1 resonance in the @xmath166 decay channel",
    ", we considered whether a more accurate description of the resonance could have further improved the agreement between the babar data and the babar s - wave monte carlo for the @xmath3 case . to describe the resonance more accurately , we derived the low - energy scattering amplitudes due to s - wave couplings between the three channels in eq .",
    "( [ ch012 ] ) : neutral charm meson pairs , charged charm meson pairs , and @xmath272 .",
    "we also considered how the scattering would be affected by an additional @xmath15 resonance with quantum numbers @xmath3 .",
    "we used the scattering amplitudes to derive the line shape for the @xmath244 decay channel and also the @xmath199 distribution .",
    "the babar p - wave monte carlo that was preferred by the babar data over the s - wave monte carlo gave an @xmath199 distribution whose peak was about 10  mev lower .",
    "we considered several mechanisms for shifting the peak for the s - wave case to lower values of @xmath199 .",
    "we considered the effects of the power - law tails of the universal scattering amplitude .",
    "we considered interference between the charm - meson scattering channels .",
    "we also considered the interference from the tail of a higher @xmath15 resonance .",
    "for all these mechanisms , the @xmath199 distribution was robust against a shift in the peak shift to lower values .",
    "we conclude that , given the resolution in the babar experiment , a more accurate description of the @xmath1 resonance in the @xmath166 decay channel is not essential .",
    "the effects we have considered may however be important in future analyses of this decay channel with higher resolution .",
