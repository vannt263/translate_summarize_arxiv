    "one of the great challenges facing modern mathematical physics and applied mathematics is to deduce turbulent transport properties directly from the fundamental equations of motion , often the navier - stokes equations describing the flow of incompressible newtonian fluids .",
    "this problem remains unsolved in general , but recent decades have witnessed significant progress in the derivation of rigorous estimates of complex flow characteristics .",
    "one approach to the analysis is the so - called `` background method '' based on a decomposition of the velocity ( or temperature ) field into a steady incompressible component that absorbs the inhomogeneous boundary conditions maintaining the flow and the associated dynamical fluctuations @xcite . roughly speaking , when the background component satisfies what appears to be a nonlinear energy stability condition as if it was a steady solution sustained by suitable forces ( or heat sources )",
    ", then it yields an upper bound on the actual transport of momentum ( or heat ) by all solutions with those boundary conditions .",
    "the background method was first applied to bound turbulent dissipation in high reynolds number shear flows driven by boundary motion , i.e. , for the traditional plane couette geometry and boundary conditions where the velocity field satisfies inhomogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions @xcite .    in many applications , however ,",
    "flows are driven by stresses , i.e. , momentum ( or heat ) fluxes , on a surface .",
    "mathematically this means that driving dirichlet conditions are replaced with inhomogeneous neumann boundary conditions which presents some challenges for the background analysis : the fluctuations are no longer `` pinned '' to the boundaries and the stability - like character of backgrounds are correspondingly more difficult to establish . this issue was first encountered in application of the background method to rayleigh - bnard convection . for conventional fixed - temperature conditions where temperature fluctuations vanish at the boundaries the background method produces rigorous upper limits to the heat flux @xcite .",
    "if the heat flux at the boundaries is specified , however , temperature fluctuations at the boundaries are not so constrained .",
    "nevertheless the background analysis could be adapted to derive lower limits on temperature drop across the layer that correspond , in terms of the high - rayleigh number scaling , with the fixed temperature bounds @xcite",
    ".    in physical oceanography applications it is natural to consider shear flows driven by ( wind ) stresses applied at a ( top ) surface , and this scenario presents a new set of challenges for the background method . in this case",
    "the goal is to derive an estimate of the mean surface flow speed from which the statistically steady state bulk dissipation may be deduced .",
    "tang , caulfield , and young @xcite first used the background method to study this problem , but rather than imposing stress boundary conditions they considered a modified model wherein a body force is applied in a thin layer near the upper surface of the layer satisfying a homogeneous neumann condition , by numerically solving the euler - lagrange equations for the optimal upper bounds producing relations between the `` applied stress '' and the mean surface speed and bulk dissipation .",
    "( they also applied a clever analysis method to establish the scaling rigorously . ) hagstrom and doering @xcite applied the background method to marangoni convection , which is also a flow driven by a stress ( proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient ) at the upper boundary .    in this paper",
    "we establish bounds for the stress - driven problem by adapting the background method to this class of problems .",
    "we derive scaling relations corresponding precisely to those of tang _",
    "et al _ with reasonable prefactors .",
    "this leads to an upper bound on the friction coefficient @xmath8 and consequently a lower bound on @xmath9 , which is what appears in tang _",
    "et al_. in the next section we describe the setup and introduce the notion of energy stability in the two - space - dimensional setting .",
    "the following section 3 presents energy stability analysis in three space dimensions , and the subsequent sections 4 and 5 contains application of the background method to stress - driven shear flow .",
    "are shown at the upper and lower surfaces , and all dependent variables are periodic in @xmath10 with period @xmath11 . ]",
    "consider flow in the two dimensional domain shown in in figure [ fig : sheardomain1 ] with periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal @xmath10 direction , a no slip condition on the bottom at @xmath12 , and a fixed shear stress on top at @xmath13 .",
    "it is convenient to work with a nondimensional version of the system so we use the domain height @xmath14 as the length scale , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid , as the time scale , and @xmath17 as the grashoff number , where @xmath4 is the stress applied at the upper surface of the fluid .",
    "the constant density throughout is scaled to unity via a suitable choice of mass units .",
    "then the equations of motion for the velocity vector field @xmath18 and pressure @xmath19 are @xmath20 with boundary conditions @xmath21 the simplest steady laminar solution of these equations , which exists for all parameter values , is the uniform shear ( couette ) flow with @xmath22 and @xmath23 constant .",
    "energy stability theory ensures that this solution is nonlinearly stable at sufficiently low @xmath0 .",
    "the analysis begins by making the substitution @xmath24 denoting the fluctuations by @xmath25 .",
    "the fluctuations equations of motion are @xmath26 with homogeneous dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions @xmath27    the dot product of the momentum equation with @xmath28 and an integration over the domain , integrating by parts with the help of the homogeneous boundary conditions for the fluctuations , leads to the energy evolution equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the @xmath31 norm on the domain , and @xmath32 is a quadratic form defined by the above expression .",
    "energy stability theory is based on the observation that if @xmath33 is positive for all divergence - free @xmath28 satisfying the fluctuations boundary conditions , then gronwall s lemma implies exponential decay of @xmath34 and thus unconditional stability of the base solution .",
    "the analysis proceeds by using variational methods to minimize @xmath35 subject to the constraints @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting euler - lagrange equations are the eigenvalue problem @xmath38 where the `` pressure '' @xmath39 is the lagrange multiplier enforcing incompressibility . if the smallest eigenvalue @xmath40 then @xmath35 is positive definite and the base solution is stable . to solve it we introduce the stream function @xmath41 satisfing @xmath42 and @xmath43 and eliminate the pressure to find the fourth order equation @xmath44 with the four boundary conditions",
    "@xmath45 the system is translation invariant in @xmath10 so we write @xmath41 in terms of its fourier series .",
    "writing @xmath46 , where @xmath47 for integer @xmath48 , the problem becomes the fourth - order ordinary differential equation @xmath49 with @xmath50 where , simply for notational neatness , we have suppressed the @xmath51 dependence of @xmath52 .",
    "we search numerically for the critical grashoff number below which all of the eigenvalues @xmath53 are positive . at the bifurcation point , where an eigenvalue first becomes negative",
    ", @xmath54 and @xmath55 must satisfy : @xmath56    therefore the critical grashoff number is the smallest magnitude real generalized eigenvalue of ( [ gr2dgen ] ) , where @xmath0 is the eigenvalue parameter .",
    "we discretized this eigenvalue problem using second order accurate finite differences with appropriate modifications to apply the boundary conditions , and used richardson extrapolation to accelerate the convergence of the resulting sequence of approximations to the smallest eigenvalue for each value of @xmath51 .",
    "the ultimate limitation on the accuracy of the computation was the condition number of the differentiation matrix corresponding to @xmath57 , which became extremely large as the mesh was refined .",
    "this approach leads us to conclude that the critical grashoff number is at least @xmath58 , and the value of @xmath51 where the first eigenvalue loses positivity is @xmath59 ( we note that @xmath51 seems very close to @xmath60 ) .",
    "in three spatial dimensions the stress driven flow problem is @xmath61 with mixed dirichlet and ( inhomogeneous ) neumann conditions @xmath62 in three dimensions @xmath63 and the domain is periodic in both @xmath10 and @xmath64 with , respectively , periods @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "steady plane parallel couette flow is again a solution and the same substitution @xmath67 and analysis as in the two dimensional case yields the euler - lagrange equations @xmath68    assuming that the critical eigenfunction is independent of @xmath10 , we can introduce a stream function @xmath41 defined by @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "( the lowest eigenmodes of shear driven flows tend to be langmuir - circulation - like flows , i.e. , streamwise aligned rolls that are independent of the streamwise direction ; this assumption is also justified by empirical observations @xcite . )",
    "then the euler - lagrange equations are @xmath71 we then eliminate the pressure @xmath72 to obtain the system @xmath73 finally we write odes for the fourier modes of @xmath74 and @xmath41 @xmath75 where @xmath76 for integer @xmath48 with boundary conditions @xmath77    this system can also be discretized and converted into a generalized eigenvalue problem exactly as before .",
    "the bifurcation occurs again through the loss of invertibility of the operator : @xmath78    we find the smallest magnitude generalized eigenvalue of ( [ gr3dgen ] ) , using @xmath0 as the eigenvalue parameter .",
    "this was done by using second order centered differences combined with richardson extrapolation .",
    "the critical grashoff number is @xmath79 , where the first negative eigenvalue appears at @xmath80 , in agreement with tang _ _ e__t al @xcite who imposed a body force in a vanishingly small layer near the upper surface to realize the shear stress boundary condition .",
    "therefore the methods used in the respective papers suggest that flows driven by shear stress are similar to those driven by a body force in a narrow region near the upper surface in terms of their energy stability boundaries .",
    "define @xmath81 to be the space - time average and @xmath82 to be the horizontal - time average . in dimensional variables the bulk energy dissipation rate , an emergent quantity ( emergent meaning that it arises from complicated interactions of the individual constituents of the fluid ) depending on the particular solution in this setup , is @xmath83 .",
    "the reynolds number , also an emergent quantity , is naturally defined @xmath84 . the familiar friction ( dissipation ) coefficient @xmath85",
    "is traditionally considered a function of @xmath86 ; for the steady couette solution @xmath87 .    for the system considered here the applied shear stress@xmath4 in dimensional variables , @xmath0 nondimensionally",
    " is the control parameter , so in order to express @xmath8 in the natural variables for analysis we need a connection between @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath4 .",
    "this comes from the global ( mean ) power balance : after taking the dot product of the momentum equation with @xmath90 and averaging we find , in dimensional units , that @xmath91 thus @xmath92 and lower estimates for the ( dimensional ) mean surface speed @xmath89 as a function of @xmath4 , i.e. , lower bounds on @xmath86 as a function of @xmath0 , result in upper limits on the friction coefficient .",
    "properly adapted to the boundary conditions at hand , the background method may be employed to produce such lower bounds on reynolds number as a function of the grashof number .",
    "we now turn to this analysis .    in the context of the non - dimensional equations , introduce a background horizontal velocity @xmath93 satisfying @xmath94 and the inhomogeneous boundary condition @xmath95 .",
    "write @xmath96 so that @xmath97 solves @xmath98 with homogeneous boundary conditions @xmath99    take the dot product with @xmath97 and compute the space time average . if the norm @xmath100 is uniformly bounded in time , then @xmath101 and we see that : @xmath102    to establish uniform boundedness of @xmath100 consider the space integral of the dot product of @xmath103 with [ eq : backgroundv ] : @xmath104    making use of the fundamental theorem of calculus for @xmath105 , and the cauchy - schwarz inequality we find : @xmath106    here we have defined the quadratic form @xmath107 by : @xmath108    we will choose @xmath109 so that we can bound @xmath107 by @xmath110 .",
    "we accomplish this by picking @xmath109 to have a vanishing derivative in the bulk of the flow , only being non - zero in boundary layers so that the boundary conditions of the fluctuation field may be satisfied .",
    "this may be accomplished by considering piece - wise linear background velocity profiles as shown in figure [ fig : background ] with boundary layers near the top and bottom of the layer .",
    "that is , consider @xmath111    , with boundary layers of width @xmath112 and @xmath113 where the slope satisfies @xmath114 , and constant profile @xmath115 in the bulk region @xmath116.,width=2 ]    for notation convenience we henceforth drop the accents and refer to the fluctuations away from the background as @xmath117 .",
    "then @xmath118    to deduce acceptable values for @xmath112 and @xmath113 , rewrite the second term on the right hand side of ( [ qd22 ] ) above as @xmath119 incompressibility implies @xmath120 which in turn implies that the second term in the integral above integrates to zero .",
    "thus , introducing the notation @xmath121 using successive applications of the cauchy - schwarz and young s inequalities , and recalling incompressibility once again , we deduce @xmath122 for any @xmath123 .",
    "choosing @xmath124 we deduce that @xmath125    then a precisely analogous analysis may be performed in the top boundary layer because although @xmath126 does not ( necessarily ) vanish when @xmath127 , @xmath128 does so the product @xmath129 does .",
    "indeed , the computation in ( [ calc ] ) does _ not _ use @xmath130 or any boundary condition on @xmath126 at all .",
    "this is where the neumann boundary conditions require a change in the analysis from dirichlet conditions @xcite ; in the latter case a properly scaling bound appears without invoking incompressibility , but in the former case incompressibility ( appears ) to be absolutely necessary .",
    "this difference reflects the fact that neumann conditions do not permit us to bound @xmath126 with the norm of its derivative near the boundary .",
    "this is a similar situation to that encountered in the fixed - flux vs. fixed temperature thermal convection case @xcite .",
    "finally , setting @xmath131 we conclude that @xmath132    using this bound : @xmath133    since we may take @xmath134 as small as we would like , we set @xmath135 , @xmath136 we invoke the poincare inequality , which for functions satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath12 , and neumann boundary conditions at @xmath137 , is @xmath138 .",
    "if @xmath139 , then we can use the poincare inequality inside the squared term : @xmath140    using this inequality , if @xmath141 , then @xmath142 .",
    "therefore @xmath143 is uniformly bounded by @xmath144 , and the time averaged expression ( [ thing ] ) is justified .",
    "having established uniform boundedness of the kinetic energy , we switch gears and prove bounds on the friction coefficient .",
    "substitute @xmath145 into @xmath146 and take a linear combination of the expansion with ( [ thing ] ) eliminating the @xmath147 term to establish @xmath148 now define the quadratic form @xmath149 which is the time average of @xmath150 , and use @xmath151 to deduce @xmath152    here is the essence of the background method : if we can choose @xmath93 so that @xmath153 is a non - negative quadratic form , then we have a lower bound for @xmath154 of the form @xmath155 the task is to produce a background profile @xmath93subject to its boundary conditions  with @xmath156 producing as large a value of @xmath157 as possible",
    ".    this may be accomplished by considering the same piece - wise linear background velocity profiles as used in the above demonstration of uniform boundedness of the the kinetic energy . then @xmath158 and @xmath159 when @xmath156 .",
    "hence the goal is to choose @xmath112 and @xmath113 to maximize their sum while keeping @xmath160 non - negative definite .",
    "using the calculations that led to [ qd22 ] leads to the equivalent expression :    @xmath161    this is positive if @xmath162 so @xmath163 when @xmath164 .",
    "in dimensional quantities this means @xmath165 , and the friction coefficient @xmath166 when @xmath167 .",
    "much of the same algebra may be used to derive bounds for the three dimensional case : the strategy is the same except that there is a @xmath64 component in the velocity field that influences details of the estimates .",
    "the same bound , @xmath168 , holds as long as @xmath169 we restrict attention to the same two - parameter ( @xmath112 , @xmath113 ) background profile as in ( [ background ] ) and figure [ fig : background ] . in this case",
    "the boundary layers thicknesses will not be chosen to be equal .",
    "we make the definition : @xmath170 a generalization of the notation introduced above in ( [ note ] ) . beginning with the second term in @xmath153 on the right hand side of ( [ qd3 ] )",
    "we use the fact that both @xmath171 and @xmath130 to deduce    @xmath172 + @xmath173 + @xmath174 + @xmath175 + @xmath176    choosing @xmath124 we conclude @xmath177    bounding the term from the upper boundary layer in three dimensions is slightly more involved than in two . first note that incompressibility implies @xmath178    the first term on the right hand side in ( [ 48 ] ) above",
    "is estimated using only the fact that @xmath179 : @xmath180    the second term on the right hand side of ( [ 48 ] ) requires a different approach .",
    "using only the fact that @xmath126 vanishes at the ( relatively distant ) bottom boundary , the inner integral may be bounded according to @xmath181 thus @xmath182    combining ( [ first ] ) an ( [ second ] ) we conclude @xmath183 and that @xmath184 when @xmath185 hence we may choose @xmath186 and @xmath113 arbitrarily small to establish the bound @xmath187 and @xmath188 , displaying the same scaling albeit with an order of magnitude larger prefactor than tang _",
    "et al _ s numerical bound @xmath189 @xcite .",
    "the latter bound is a variable bound that depends on @xmath86 , has a maximum value of @xmath190 and tends asymptotically to @xmath191 as @xmath86 goes to infinity .",
