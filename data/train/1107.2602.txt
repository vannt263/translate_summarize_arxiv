    "during last decades it has been realized that the investigation of the problems associated with the cosmological constant would provide an insight into the structure and the properties of elusive quantum gravity . a serious problem concerning the cosmological constant refers to the vast discrepancy between the value a theorist would expect and the very low value of the effective cosmological constant . as zeldovich @xcite",
    "first noticed , the effective cosmological constant we measure is the sum of the pure geometric origin cosmological constant plus the energy density of the vacuum .",
    "it seems impossible to understand why the measured effective cosmological constant is so much smaller than the value of the vacuum energy calculated by a quantum field theorist ( cosmic phase transition , quantum field zero - point energies ) .",
    "this puzzle challenges the inflationary scenario and the various models of quantum gravity .",
    "the present work attempts to solve a recently emerged problem regarding the cosmological constant issue which concerns the measured cosmic acceleration . during the last decade",
    ", it has been established through different independent pieces of astronomical data that empty space , devoid of the usual matter , is anti - gravitating .",
    "it creates gravitational repulsion and gives rise to an accelerated cosmological expansion . according to our present - day understanding",
    ", this accelerated expansion could be induced by an effective cosmological  constant \"- like term ( vacuum @xmath0 or dark energy @xmath1 ) .",
    "data suggest that the magnitude of the required vacuum / dark energy is quite close to the critical ( closure ) cosmological energy density ( approximately 70% ) . why vacuum energy , which stays constant in the course of cosmological evolution , or why dark energy , which evolves with time quite differently from the normal matter , have similar magnitude with matter density just today , all being close to the value of the critical energy density",
    "?    there are several ideas in literature , though yet incomplete , that have the potential to provide solutions to cosmic acceleration problem .",
    "the present paper proposes that _ the negative five - dimensional pressure produced from an astrophysical brane - bulk energy outflow occurring inside all cosmic black holes _ is large enough to drive the measured cosmic acceleration .",
    "assuming an rs - like cosmological brane @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , this total pressure ( called dark pressure ) arising from the sum of all negative pressures normal to the brane suffices to explain the coincidence problem , without using a negative vacuum energy or exotic fields / fluids throughout the universe . in the presented scenario dark energy",
    " originates \" from dark matter ( grows from a negligible value to a significant one due to dark pressure ) ; moreover , the recent appearance of the cosmic acceleration is correlated to the recent increase of the galactic core black hole density .",
    "an accelerating universe has already been produced by several brane - bulk energy exchange scenarios @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , in all these works the whole universe should be hot enough , and therefore , these scenarios fail to explain recent acceleration .    both astrophysical black holes in haloes and supermassive black holes at the galactic centres",
    "appear after the large scale structure of the universe , weight a portion of @xmath2 and are regions where high energy interactions occur .",
    "this fact will be at the center of the proposed mechanism .",
    "assuming that a brane cosmological model describes our universe , it is natural to expect a moderate exchange of energy between the brane and the bulk .",
    "astrophysical black holes contain matter in an unknown form , i.e. effective quantum fluid ( possibly arising from superposition of non empty black hole quantum spacetimes ) and accrete continuously mass .",
    "collapsing matter falling into a black hole accelerates , interacts and gets easily  thermalized \" to temperatures close and above @xmath3 ( five - dimensional fundamental planck mass ) .",
    "furthermore , it is expected portion of black hole mass to be in the form of highly energetic states close to @xmath3 , not only due to accreting matter interactions but also due to hawking - like particle production in the interior @xcite . but for energy scales close to @xmath3 , matter interactions result to graviton escape to the bulk . therefore , energy outflow can occur in the interior of galactic halo black holes and galactic core supermassive black holes .",
    "this black hole originated exchange results to non - zero energy - momentum tensor components @xmath4 and @xmath5 and is able to provide the necessary conditions for a cosmic acceleration .",
    "the emission of gravitons to the bulk is associated with negative dark pressure on the brane . indeed , a brane experiences positive pressure when bulk particles fall into it .",
    "this negative pressure is the responsible quantity that provides the required amount of the measured cosmic acceleration .",
    "although there is a small outflow in our scenario in each of the galactic black holes ( consistent with black hole mass evolution and galaxy dynamics ) , this leakage is associated unavoidably with orders of magnitude larger dark pressure . moreover ,",
    "the emerged dark energy is not a small portion of the dark matter but of the same order with it .",
    "note that in our scenario , before outflow starts ( before galaxy formation ) there may be either a zero or a very small positive non zero decelerating dark radiation term @xmath6 .",
    "however , this radiation term overpasses well known problems of nucleosynthesis constraints @xcite .",
    "when negative dark pressure emerges , this radiation term is modified and finally becomes an accelerating dark energy component .    note also that it costs almost nothing to stretch a brane that has zero total tension / cosmological constant @xcite . apparently spacetime is such that it takes a lot of energy to curve it , while stretching it is almost for free , since the cosmological constant is zero .",
    "this is quite contrary properties of objects from every day experience , where bending requires much less energy than stretching .",
    "the present study tries only to explain naturally the recent cosmic acceleration while assumes that there is some mechanism that sets the cosmological constant from field theory vacuum energy equal to zero ( for example r - s fine tuning , holography etc . ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii the mathematical framework",
    "is presented .",
    "here , it becomes obvious from eq .",
    "( [ simple2 ] ) that the negative dark pressure @xmath7 can drive acceleration . in addition ,",
    "( [ systemb3 ] ) shows that @xmath7 determines also the time derivative of dark energy , resulting to the current value of @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , the question of how large should be the present value of dark pressure @xmath7 , is estimated in eq .",
    "( [ current po ] ) .",
    "such a value can easily be obtained , as it is explained in sections iii and v , for moderate values of the involved astrophysical parameters . in section",
    "iii the connection of the mathematical framework with the astrophysical context is given .",
    "section iv provides various supportive theoretical aspects of the physics of the proposed mechanism .",
    "however , section iv is not crucial to the main results of the analysis . in section v numerical computations are presented in order to prove the success of the model .",
    "results have been derived both analytically and numerically ( for verification reasons ) and are presented together with descriptions of the range of the involved parameters that ensure : i ) recent passage from deceleration to acceleration , ii ) small outflow that do not violate black hole evolution / mass , iii ) nucleosynthesis bounds , and iv ) universe age . finally ,",
    "section vi is dedicated to the conclusions .",
    "we begin with a model described by a 5-dim einstein - hilbert action with matter and a 5-dim cosmological constant @xmath9 plus the contribution describing the brane @xmath10where @xmath11 is the ricci scalar of the five - dimensional metric @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 is the induced metric on the 3-brane .",
    "we identify @xmath15 with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , in order to impose the usual @xmath18 reflection symmetry of the ads slice . following the conventions of @xcite , we extend the bulk integration over the entire interval @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20and @xmath21 are the bulk and brane matter contents respectively .",
    "@xmath3 is the five - dimensional planck mass .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 can include the brane tension as well as quantum contributions to the four - dimensional cosmological constant .    in order to search for cosmological solutions we consider the corresponding form for the metric @xmath23where @xmath24 is a maximally symmetric 3-dimensional metric with @xmath25 ( we use @xmath26 to parameterize the spatial curvature ) .",
    "the five - dimensional einstein equations are @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the total energy momentum tensor , i.e. @xmath29 here , @xmath30 denotes the energy - momentum tensor of the brane perfect cosmic fluid and @xmath31 , @xmath32 are its energy density and pressure respectively . in our approach @xmath33",
    "gets non zero contributions from the presence of flows from the brane .",
    "the off - diagonal contribution @xmath34 expresses the brane - bulk energy exchange flow of gravitons , while the @xmath35 component expresses the corresponding pressure along the fifth dimension . in order to keep predictability we seek to derive a solution that is largely independent of the bulk dynamics .",
    "thus , any other existing bulk field contribution is considered negligible .",
    "in addition , a small energy exchange from the brane ( true in the proposed mechanism ) keeps the bulk largely unperturbed .",
    "the set of the einstein equations at the location of the brane is @xmath36 dots indicate derivatives with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "we indicate by the subscript @xmath38 \" the value of various quantities on the brane and @xmath39 are the 05 and 55 components of @xmath28 evaluated on the brane .",
    "since we are interested in a model that reduces to the randall - sundrum vacuum @xcite in the absence of matter we require the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension to satisfy @xmath40 .",
    "it is convenient to employ a coordinate frame in which @xmath41 in the above equations .",
    "this can be achieved by using gauss normal coordinates with @xmath42 and by going to the temporal gauge on the brane with @xmath43 .",
    "thus , using @xmath44 and @xmath45 and omitting the subscript @xmath38 for convenience in the following , we take @xmath46 here , @xmath47 is the usual deceleration parameter @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xmath51 are the discontinuities of the zero - five and five - five components of the bulk energy - momentum tensor respectively .",
    "it is obvious from eqs .",
    "( [ simple1 ] ) , ( [ simple2 ] ) that the only way to pass from a deceleration era to an accelerated cosmic phase in a flat universe ( @xmath52 ) is the case that the dark pressure term @xmath7 becomes negative at some moment in the cosmic history .",
    "this is actually what happens in the studied proposal where dark pressure from zero acquires a non - zero negative value due to the leakage towards the extra dimension .",
    "as we will explain in section iii this leakage causes a negative pressure in every galactic center resulting to a total value for @xmath7 capable to produce the observed cosmic acceleration .",
    "defining now an auxiliary quantity @xmath53 by @xmath54 we can rewrite equations ( [ systema1 ] ) , ( [ systema2 ] ) in the equivalent form @xmath55    here , the effective cosmological constant on the brane @xmath56 , as we have mentioned before , it will be set to zero , but for the time being we leave it intact .",
    "additionally , @xmath57 in order to recover standard 4-dimensional gravity",
    ".    in the special case of no - exchange @xmath58 represents the dark radiation @xmath59 , reflecting the non - zero weyl tensor of the bulk .    in order to study further cosmic acceleration ,",
    "it is convenient to consider the set of differential equations ( [ systemc1 ] ) , ( [ systemc2 ] ) for @xmath60 , equivalent to the last system of equations ( [ systemb1 ] ) , ( [ systemb2 ] ) , ( [ systemb3 ] ) @xmath61 \\label{systemc1 } \\\\ & & \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad\\frac{d\\rho } { da}=-\\frac{1}{a}\\left [ 3(1+w)\\rho + t\\ h^{-1}\\right]\\ , , \\label{systemc2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we should replace everywhere @xmath53 and @xmath62  by = -(2 + 3w)^2-(1 + 3w)+h^2q-  + [ psi ] = and we substitute @xmath63 with the help of @xmath64 it is worth mentioning that both @xmath65 and @xmath66 , according to the proposed mechanism , depend on the astrophysical properties of black holes .",
    "we are going to distinguish two cases in our numerical study of the system ( [ systemc1 ] ) , ( [ systemc2 ] ) .",
    "both are consistent with the details of the involved phenomena . in the first case , which is valid for a study of the recent cosmological time period , i.e. @xmath67 close to 0",
    ", we assume a constant number of typical galactic black holes and therefore , the dark pressure @xmath65 can be modeled to be analogous to a known constant @xmath68 times the inverse hubble volume , @xmath69 ( see section iii for justification ) .",
    "the same holds also for the outflow that can be approximated to be analogous to a known constant @xmath70 times the inverse hubble volume , @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , the derivative @xmath72 that appears in ( [ systemc1 ] ) should be replaced as follows @xmath73 finally , @xmath74 can be found solving exactly the cubic equation @xmath75 the above cubic equation for all realistic parameters has always two real positive roots associated with expanding universe and one negative leading to contracting cosmological solutions .",
    "these two roots for @xmath74 are given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 ^{1/3}\\,\\,,\\,\\ , s_{2}=\\big [ \\eta -(\\vartheta ^{3}+\\eta ^{2})^{1/2}\\big]^{1/3}\\nn \\\\ & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!a= \\frac{1-q}{\\sqrt{\\beta } \\,\\varpi}\\,\\,\\,,\\,\\,\\ , \\vartheta = -\\frac{1}{9}a^{2}\\nn\\\\ & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\eta \\!=\\!-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(3w\\!+\\!1)\\beta \\rho ^{2}\\!+\\!(3w\\!-\\!1)\\gamma \\rho + \\frac{k}{a^{2}}\\!-\\!2\\lambda } { \\sqrt{\\beta } \\varpi } \\!-\\ ! \\frac{1}{27}a^{3}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , the system of differential equations ( [ systemc1 ] ) , ( [ systemc2 ] ) can easily be solved numerically .",
    "thus , it is possible to test if the measured cosmic acceleration can be produced from some sensible values of @xmath78 according to our scenario .    in the second case which is more general",
    ", we do not assume a constant number of black holes since we are interested to include the dependence of the total mass density of black holes on the scale factor evolution .",
    "in this way it will be possible to describe the cosmological behaviour for redshifts far away from @xmath79 .",
    "the proposed mechanism suggests , in this second case , that @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where  @xmath82 , @xmath83 are known constants and  @xmath84 is the density of the relevant black holes which is a function of the scale factor .",
    "now , the derivative @xmath72 that appears in ( [ systemc1 ] ) , equals @xmath85 since it is possible to know estimations concerning the evolution of @xmath84 as a function of @xmath86 ( see section v ) , it is possible to solve numerically the system ( [ systemc1 ] ) , ( [ systemc2 ] ) . in this second case , there is no need to solve any cubic equation since we can estimate @xmath74 from ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "let s now see if we can learn from these dynamic equations something about the value of dark pressure we need to have in order to explain cosmic acceleration .",
    "equation ( [ constraint ] ) provides a constraint that the cosmic acceleration should satisfy . from it",
    ", we can determine the current value of @xmath65 as a function of the present values & & _ 0 = ( -1+q_0 + )  ^-1/2h_0 ^ 2 + & & q_0 = 1-+_0h_0 ^ -2  ^1/2 [ q0 ] , where we have replaced @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath89 .",
    "note that the current value of the deceleration parameter @xmath90 depends only on @xmath91 now , if we set @xmath92 and for example @xmath93 , we get @xmath94 such negative values can be easily realized in our scenario , arising from the proposed outflow mechanism .",
    "therefore , it is possible without solving the differential equations to check the efficiency of the proposed mechanism using the value of @xmath7 which is fully determined from the involved astrophysical parameters and the value of @xmath3 . in this way , someone can be convinced that a small outflow in each of the galactic black holes suffices to result to the required amount of the total dark pressure and consequently to the measured cosmic acceleration .",
    "intuitively , one could say that the geometry of the membrane universe is such that the negative dark pressure `` stretches '' this membrane and causes acceleration .",
    "since @xmath47 is not directly measured , we have to express it as a function of the ratios of cosmological matter density to critical density and dark energy density to critical density .",
    "we define@xmath95 and for the dark energy part @xmath96 therefore , eq .",
    "( [ systemb2 ] ) gives @xmath97 finally , the deceleration parameter can be found from @xmath98 this last equation is going to provide us the initial condition for @xmath99 given that @xmath100 is provided by the astrophysical parameters , either in the first or second case discussed above .",
    "now , the system of differential equations ( [ systemc1 ] ) , ( [ systemc2 ] can be solved using the initial conditions @xmath90 , @xmath101 .",
    "another useful quantity used in physical cosmology is the coefficient @xmath8 of the equation of state of the dark energy . in our case",
    "the dark energy density encodes the density required to represent the energy exchange . according to @xcite , @xmath8",
    "is given by @xmath102 it is straightforward to prove that @xmath103 and therefore , the today value ( for @xmath104 ) is @xmath105 the numerical value of @xmath106 will be a prediction for our model .",
    "this equation manifestly shows that a negative dark pressure term can easily cause not only cosmic acceleration but also the crossing of the @xmath107 phantom divide line .",
    "this was pointed out in a different context in @xcite .",
    "finally , an alternative useful expression that can be derived from equations ( [ systemb1 ] ) , ( [ systemb2 ] ) , ( [ systemb3 ] ) is the following single differential equation for @xmath52 that depends on the energy density and which can be easily solved numerically @xmath108,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath109and we replace everywhere @xmath74 and @xmath110 from equations ( [ psi ] ) , ( [ h ] ) or ( [ constraint ] ) .",
    "as mentioned , in the randall - sundrum model the effective cosmological constant @xmath111 vanishes , and this is the value we assume in the rest of the paper .",
    "we also set @xmath52 since we are interested on flat universes .",
    "finally , since we are analyzing the cosmic acceleration after the large scale structure of the universe we set @xmath104 .",
    "it is quite natural in the framework of brane cosmologies to expect a small energy exchange of our brane universe with the bulk space .",
    "this energy exchange phenomenon is a high energy phenomenon .",
    "the channels for energy exchange open \" when the relevant energies reach the relatively low five - dimensional fundamental planck energy scale @xmath3 . in the cosmological context regions where such high energy phenomena could occur",
    "are not as many .    in general",
    ", we would expect a brane - bulk energy exchange through :    1 .",
    "high energy interactions in some accretion disks and more importantly inside galactic centres / galactic black holes leading to energy loss to the bulk due to the production of gravitons from high energetic accelerated particles .",
    "2 .   gravitational attraction of a portion of the gravitons that were escaped into the bulk or gravitational accretion of bulk matter to brane black hole .",
    "3 .   attraction of bulk matter from the whole brane .",
    "4 .   decay of very massive scalars and/or fermions .    the third type of exchange can be seriously studied only if the bulk matter content is known in detail , see for example @xcite , and consequently only if we are sure about the geometry of the bulk space , its anisotropies and the motion of our brane in it .",
    "various different approaches to describe bulk dynamics / matter can be found in @xcite , @xcite , tetradis , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the fourth exchange mechanism @xcite works only for very massive particles like light supersymmetric particles with masses above 1tev . this option to produce",
    "the measured acceleration is not very generic ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the second exchange mechanism regarding attraction of the escaping gravitons contributes to dark pressure , but only to a small amount at late times @xcite , for which we are interested in . on the other hand , the attraction of bulk matter from the gravitational field of brane black holes may be not negligible for significant values of bulk matter density .",
    "nevertheless , since we are interested to investigate energy exchange without losing predictability we have assumed that the matter energy density of bulk fluid is small or zero .",
    "our proposed mechanism considers a homogeneous distribution of galactic black holes on a brane .",
    "the study of a swiss cheese - like brane world model with bulk energy exchange in each black hole ( extension of work @xcite ) certainly would be a more precise modeling .",
    "the case is analogous to a swiss - cheese like brane world model with schwarzschild - de sitter black holes finally resulting to a dust frw cosmology with an overall cosmological constant arising from each black hole contribution .",
    "however , the modifications of this more precise modeling are expected to be small .",
    "therefore , the total brane - bulk energy exchange under consideration will be @xmath112 where @xmath113 represents the outflow of energy due to the production of escaping gravitons from high energetic particles inside bhs .",
    "note also that in the present paper we will not consider the possibility of an existing considerable amount of primordial black holes today , and therefore we will not study further scenarios with such black holes .",
    "last years it became evident that every nearby massive galaxy possesses a central black hole with mass proportional to that of the galaxy spheroid .",
    "this implies that they also possess an active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are evidences for the existence of a large amount of extra - galactic exposure at tev energies @xcite , @xcite and some of it can be associated to the presence of galactic black holes and galactic core supermassive black holes .",
    "it is certainly a safe assumption that in the accretion discs and more importantly in the interiors of galactic black holes and galactic core supermassive black holes various particles as electrons and protons can be thermalised / accelerated to energies around @xmath3 or above .",
    "particle acceleration starts in the accretion discs outside the horizon and increases as the particle crosses it .",
    "consequently , particle collisions become capable to produce gravitons escaping to the bulk space .    moreover , assuming a black hole with physics that respects unitarity in its interior , it is acceptable to use the picture of an effective quantum fluid that fills the black hole and does not concentrate at the singular center ( otherwise there will be information loss from the exactly thermal hawking radiation ) .",
    "this effective fluid may be on a high temperature below or close to @xmath114 at these energies it is possible @xcite , @xcite to obtain rapid energy favored production of bulk gravitons from collisions of energetic brane matter . in a hot plasma the production rate per 3-volume is the thermal average of the cross section times the lost energy of the particles .",
    "therefore , the total energy loss rate due to bulk graviton radiation is @xcite , @xcite@xmath115where @xmath116 is the temperature and @xmath117 is the total energy density of the hot regions . the second equation in ( [ escapeplasma ] ) is derived assuming a relativistic plasma with @xmath118 the effective number of the relativistic degrees of freedom .    in order to proceed to a rough estimation of the mean outflow energy rate , an effective mean black hole plasma energy - mass density @xmath119is assumed inside brane black holes expressed with the help of an effective mean temperature @xmath120 the following expression will be used @xmath121 now , let @xmath122 be the leakage of energy from the total volume of the warm plasma of a black hole . in order to evaluate @xmath113",
    "we have to add all these leakages from all galactic halo black holes and all black holes at the galactic central regions and divide with the hubble volume @xmath123 , thus @xmath124 .",

    "it should be noticed that the proposed outflow mechanism has no similarity with scenarios that set the density of the plasma equal to the density of the overall cosmological fluid which cools as the universe expands .",

    "thus , the system of differential equations that the evolution of the collapsing region should respect is & & + 3 ( _ pls+p_pls ) = -t_pls + & & = _ pls^2 + 2_pls-+ + & & + 4=2 ( _ pls+ ) t_pls-2  _",
    "pls , where @xmath151 characterizes the spatial topology of the collapsing shell ( with most interesting case @xmath152 ) . here ,",
    "the scale factor @xmath153 of the collapse region is related to the proper radius @xmath154 from the center of the cloud through @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the comoving coordinate and the dot denotes a proper time derivative .",
    "the energy outflow and dark pressure are given by & & t_pls_pls^20.112  g _ + & & _ pls=-_pls^+1 -(g__mean^4)^+1 .",
    "collapsing plasma has been assumed to have an equation of state deviated from this of an ideal gas .",
    "the relation between the energy density and the temperature ( local thermodynamic equilibrium ) is given by the ansatz @xmath157 .",
    "pressure is expressed as @xmath158 .",
    "realistic quantum fluids can effectively be described by an equation of state with deviations from ideal gas behavior @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to study the temperature evolution as the collapse continues , we have to find solution of the following system of differential equations _ mean+_mean ( 1+^-1 _ mean^4 ( -1 ) )  + 0.014=0 = ^2 _ mean^8 + 2_mean^4-+ & & + 4=0.112 ( _",

    "mean^4(+1 ) .",
    "the above system of the first and third equation can be solved numerically without difficulties .",
    "this study shows that for expected parameters @xmath159 and for @xmath160 , which is the case of spherical collapse , we can get @xmath161 , which is what we want to prove . a typical solution of this system is shown in fig .",
    "1 , where time @xmath37 is measured in gev@xmath162 and temperature @xmath163 in gev .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     summary of results for @xmath164 and for various values of the parameters consistent with today acceleration    based on the derived expressions ( [ t0 ] ) , ( [ p0 ] ) for the cosmic energy outflow @xmath165 and the associated pressure @xmath166 , we will consider various cases for the black hole matter content in order to evaluate the cosmic acceleration .",
    "first we will consider as an extreme case a matter content with a large amount of black holes in halos suggested in @xcite . in this case",
    ", we assume a universe with @xmath167 halos and @xmath168 large black holesper halo .",
    "further we set as a crude mean mass for a halo black hole a value equal to @xmath169 .",
    "consequently , we estimate a total mass in the form of halo black holes equal to @xmath170 ( these numbers were taken from frampton , however , note that the assumption appeared in @xcite that all dark matter consists of black holes is not necessary or related to the present paper ) .",
    "galactic core black holes contribute much less in this case , i.e. there are @xmath167 supermassive black holes each with a mean mass @xmath171 , i.e. @xmath172 therefore , in this extreme case all the cosmic acceleration comes from halo black holes .",
    "we can get @xmath173 for various combinations of the parameters , see table 2 .",
    "it is more safe to assume that the mass density of galactic core black holes is larger than the density of halo black holes .",
    "taking @xmath174 , again there are plenty of numerical solutions of ( [ systemc1 ] ) , ( [ systemc2 ] ) for various parameters giving acceleration @xmath173 .",
    "similarly , assuming a more conservative case where @xmath175 it is easy to find many numerical solutions of equations ( [ systemc1 ] ) , ( [ systemc2 ] ) resulting to the required cosmic acceleration .",
    "such representative results are shown in table 2 .",
    "results shown in table 2 reveal that the various quantities are of the same order with the corresponding quantities of table 1 as expected .",
    "astrophysical constraints_. it is worth emphasizing that all these estimated values of energy loss @xmath165 appeared in tables 1 and 2 are small values that do not cause any astrophysical inconsistency on galaxy evolution or black hole dynamics .",
    "the rest of this section is devoted to the explanation of the absence of any conflict with the known observational characteristics of the galaxies and of their black holes .",
    "thus , two astrophysical constraints are considered for the case where the outflow occurs at the centers of core black holes .",
    "the other case where galactic halo black holes dominate the energy outflow will be considered later .    a first bound",
    "can be found demanding that the lifetime of a galactic core black hole loosing energy according to our scenario is larger than the typical lifetime of such black holes @xmath176 years .",
    "an estimate of the lowest possible lifetime in the worst case scenario is found dividing the rest black hole energy @xmath177 of a typical black hole by its outflow , eq.([escapeplasma ] ) , and its volume , therefore @xmath178 this bound is easily satisfied for all expected values of @xmath165 , for example for @xmath179 and @xmath180 the lifetime estimate is @xmath181 years !    a second bound can be obtained from the requirement that the current total energy loss from all the volume of black hole be smaller than the energy gain from the accretion of the black hole at the galactic core minus the energy ejected in various frequencies . in galaxies with agns and a super massive black hole @xcite , @xcite , @xcite the mass accretion rate @xmath182",
    "is expected to be a fraction of the measured luminosity @xmath138 .",
    "the ratio @xmath183 defines the conversion efficiency of gravitational energy into radiation and varies during the evolution of the accretion disc within the range @xmath184 . on the other hand ,",
    "the measured luminosity has been observed to be always a fraction ( called efficiency and ranging from somewhat below 0.01 for the low luminosity agns to 0.1 for the large luminosity agns - strong accretors ) of the eddington luminosity @xmath185erg sec@xmath162 . as a result , in any case for the purpose of estimating this second constraint , the net gain of energy rate @xmath182",
    "can be assumed to be around @xmath186 and therefore the second bound becomes @xmath187 a black hole with mass @xmath188 , losing energy with average temperature of the effective plasma @xmath189 and @xmath190 , is associated with an energy loss rate equal to @xmath191 erg sec@xmath162 .",
    "such losses are orders of magnitude smaller numbers compared to accretion rates .",
    "therefore , they can not alter significantly the black hole mass and make impossible the violation of any measured relations between central galactic back hole mass and galactic halo mass or of the observed expression of black hole density as a function of redshift ( eq .",
    "( [ rhoofz ] ) that was used in the present section ) .    next",
    ", let s study the constraints regarding the extreme case where galactic halo black holes @xcite , @xcite dominate the energy outflow @xmath165 .",
    "the first bound demands that the time duration required for a black hole of mass @xmath177 to lose all its rest energy be larger than the maximum lifetime of a typical galactic halo black hole @xmath192 years .",
    "the first bound can be easily met ; for example , for a halo black hole ( see table 2 ) with @xmath193 the estimated lifetime is @xmath194years !",
    "finally , for halo black holes the second bound can be studied demanding the net energy gain due to accretion of mass minus the radiated energy be larger than the energy loss to extra dimensions .",
    "now , we have to distinguish two types of galactic halo black holes .",
    "black holes that are part of a binary system have usually an efficiency @xmath195 from 0.01 to 1 , while the conversion efficiency is around 0.01 to 0.1 .",
    "thus the net energy rate gain is expected to be close to eddington accretion , which in this case is @xmath196erg sec@xmath162 . for halo black holes with mass @xmath197 and with @xmath193",
    "the loss rate is equal only to @xmath198 erg sec@xmath162 .",
    "on the other hand , galactic halo black holes that do not belong to a binary system can not be observed since they do not accrete matter and there is no accretion disk to radiate .",
    "therefore , in this case it is not possible to know their properties and apply the second bound .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our cosmology solves also the problem of the age of the universe .",
    "this is known to be true for braneworld models with non zero @xmath199 due to the produced cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "this work proposes that the recent cosmic acceleration happens as a result of the negative five - dimensional pressures produced in the galactic black holes of a brane cosmological rs setup .",
    "it was proved that the total contribution @xmath7 from all the dark pressures from all the centers of galaxies suffice to provide the measured cosmic acceleration .",
    "an exciting outcome is that the recent passage from the deceleration to the acceleration era happens due to the recent increase of the galactic core black hole mass density .",
    "based on the derived expressions we have shown that it is easy to get the expected negative values of cosmic acceleration @xmath173 and dark energy @xmath200 _ even for conservative values of all the relevant parameters _ ,",
    "i.e. for small values of the mean temperature @xmath134 in the interior of the black holes , for small values of galactic core black holes masses and for values of the five - dimensional planck mass @xmath3 several decades of tevs . in our mechanism",
    ", outflow is associated unavoidably with a large dark pressure .",
    "the magnitude of the produced dark pressure is connected with that of dark radiation through the equation of state of the quantum fluid in the interior of a black hole .",
    "qualitatively one can immediately check the efficiency of producing the observed cosmic acceleration estimating the required amount of dark pressure shown in equations ( [ q0 ] ) , ( [ current po ] ) or ( [ current po2 ] ) .",
    "this value of dark pressure can naturally be realized in our case based on the known astrophysical data and the assumed temperature of the effective fluid .",
    "of course , in order cosmic acceleration to be proven , the system of differential equations ( [ systemc1 ] ) , ( [ systemc2 ] ) has to be solved , and indeed it is seen that the energy exchange along with the dark pressure give an order one effect on cosmological scales .",
    "the proposed mechanism has several advantages : i ) it is independent of the bulk matter and consequently retains predictability , ii ) the associated values of @xmath110 in the hubble evolution ( [ systemb2 ] ) originate from the brane black hole astrophysical phenomenon of energy outflow @xmath66 and its associated pressure @xmath65 along the fifth dimension , and not from the motion or the position of the brane in the bulk , thus again retaining predictability , iii ) the mechanism is on `` at present times and off '' at the early stages of the cosmic evolution explaining naturally coincidence problem , iv ) it relates the amount of the produced acceleration with the present matter content , and v ) it produces easily cosmic acceleration for sensible values of the relevant parameters .",
    "however , the most interesting and worth mentioning finding is the fact that sensible and safe values of outflow , as those appeared in table 2 , suffice to result to the observed cosmic acceleration .",
    "a first reason behind this outcome is the large number of galaxies in the universe .",
    "another reason is that the additive effect of all outflows and associated much larger dark pressures from each galactic center result to a non negligible kinetic effect , i.e. acceleration due to the geometry of the setup .",
    "finally , the dark pressure drives towards acceleration from earlier times of the cosmic evolution and not just today . since energy density of the galactic core black holes increases as redshift decreases at recent times ( @xmath201 ) , dark pressure becomes stronger driving the passage to the acceleration era .    in summary ,",
    "the novelties of the present article are : 1 ) correction of a wide spread mistake among the brane cosmologists that outflow is associated with a positive and not negative dark pressure , 2 ) the presentation of a new astrophysical origin mechanism of brane - bulk energy exchange , 3 ) new braneworld solutions describing the evolution of brane equations with non zero @xmath4 , @xmath202 , 4 ) new gravitational collapse solution on a brane with non zero @xmath4 , @xmath5 , 5 ) numerical results estimating the produced cosmic acceleration , and 6 ) correlation of the measured acceleration to the recent rise of the galactic core black hole cosmic energy density .",
    "the calculations of the scenario could have failed for various reasons : if a very high temperature was needed in the interior of the black hole , or if a small fundamental planck scale or a large @xmath34 was needed conflicting of course with galactic dynamics , or if for the given variation of the cosmic black hole density as a function of redshift the cosmic evolution failed to posses a long deceleration era accompanied by a recent acceleration one . however , the concrete and conservative numerical values used lead the scenario to success .    one interesting point worth to be raised is that the proposed mechanism could work together with various studies that suggest solutions to the cosmological problem .",
    "for example , there are recent holographic ideas capable to explain why the cosmological constant should be almost zero @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , it appears to have a difficulty to explain naturally the cosmic equation of state .",
    "therefore , the present work together with all type of holographic explanations can provide a complete solution to the general problem of the cosmological constant value .",
    "we would like to thank v. charmandaris , t. harko , e. kiritsis and i. papadakis for useful discussions and comments ."
