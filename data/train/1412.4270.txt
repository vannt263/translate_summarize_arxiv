    "the dynamical control of the electronic properties of dirac fermions in the solid state environment by means of time periodic fields is currently an intense research topic .",
    "@xcite among the two - dimensional materials supporting these dirac fermions we have as prominent examples graphene@xcite and silicene@xcite . in this work",
    "we focus our attention on silicene which consists of a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice structure made of silicon atoms analogous to that of graphene . from the experimental point of view",
    "some recent works have reported the synthesis of silicene@xcite . as well as in the case of graphene ,",
    "the silicene honeycomb lattice consists of two triangular sublattices . however , silicene has a corrugated or buckled lattice structure that makes the silicon atoms in one sublattice to be perpendicularly displaced with respect to those atoms lying on the other sublattice . in the low energy hamiltonian description of silicene ,",
    "this sublattice degree of freedon is formally associated to a quantity called pseudospin which resembles the real spin . moreover , in momentum space there are two degenerate energy extrema called dirac points , denoted by momenta @xmath0 , that are related by time reversal symmetry and they lie at opposite corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone . to this energy extrema",
    "one can associate a valley degree of freedom which in turn can also be described as a pseudospin@xcite .",
    "this degree of freedom has been shown to be suitable for the potential realization of _ valleytronics _ ,",
    "i.e. , the analogous to spintronics based on the real spin ( for a review on spintronics see @xcite ) .",
    "+ in the case of the sublattice pseudospin there have also been proposals to realize the so called _ pseudospintronics _ , where physical operations such as pseudospin magnetism in bilayer graphene@xcite can in principle be performed by means of this physical quantity .",
    "this in turn steems from the chiral nature of the hamiltonian eigenstates for which the pseudospin is locked to the charge carrier s momentum .",
    "this chirality has profound consequences that include an unusual sequencing of plateaus in measurements of the quantum hall effect@xcite .",
    "in addition , in the conduction band of valley @xmath1 pseudospin is parallel to the momentum while in the valence band , pseudospin is antiparallel to the charge carriers momenta .",
    "therefore , another physical manifestation of this pseudospin degree of freedom in graphene is that chiral states can be perfectly transmitted through a potential barrier which constitutes a realization of the klein paradox in condensed matter@xcite . in silicene",
    ", another pseudospin effect has been predicted to appear when a perpendicular electric field @xmath2 is applied since , in this case , the atoms belonging to each sublattice would respond differently to @xmath2 , giving rise to an staggered potential@xcite . due to this peculiar pseudospin response to applied electric fields , the electronic properties of silicene",
    "are predicted to considerably differ from those of graphene , despite their formal similarities . in particular , one can induce a pseudospin polarization in the silicene sample by means of a perpendicular static electric field . since the pseudospin degree of freedom mus be included in the total angular momentum operator@xcite , this pseudospin polarization can be interpreted as a differential population of the charge carriers on each sublattice as a response of the charge carriers to the angular momentum content of the circularly polarized radiation field . moreover",
    ", the linear spectrum of the low energy hamiltonian ( near the dirac points ) for both graphene and silicene leads to a fermi velocity that is independent of momentum .",
    "in fact , within the dirac cone approximation , the velocity operator is proportional to the pseudospin operator describing the sublattice degree of freedom@xcite . in presence of a radiation field ,",
    "the pseudospin gets coupled ( via the minimal prescription ) to the electromagnetic field , and thus , dynamical modulation has been predicted to appear both in graphene@xcite and silicene@xcite either at zero or finite momentum.@xcite    another interesting feature of silicene is that its intrinsic spin - orbit coupling is much larger than that of pristine graphene .",
    "therefore , an interesting interplay among intrinsic spin - orbit coupling and electric field effects was predicted to appear because the bandgap can be electrically controlled .",
    "moreover , the addition of an exchange potential term ( which physically could represent the proximity effect due to coupling to ferromagnetic leads ) allows for topological quantum phase transitions in the static regime.@xcite furthermore , in presence of circularly polarized electromagnetic radiation it has been recently proposed the realization of the so called single dirac cone phase@xcite . at this topological phase",
    ", it is found that well defined spin polarized states are supported at every dirac point . within this configuration ,",
    "different spin components propagate in opposite directions giving rise to a pure spin current at finite momentum.@xcite yet , these photoinduced topological phase changes@xcite reported by ezawa@xcite were derived under the off resonant assumption , i.e. , dynamical processes such that the frequency ( coupling strength ) of the radiation field is much larger ( smaller ) than any other energy scale in the problem . under these assumptions it is possible to derive an effective time - independent floquet hamiltonian@xcite with a tiny photoinduced bandgap correction that stems from virtual photons that dress the static energy eingenstates . since the sign of the bandgap term ( i.e. , the effective bandgap ) determines important topological properties of the material , it is vital both for potential practical implementations , for instance in techonological realizations of silicene - based devices , as well as from a fundamental point of view , to effectively achieve manipulation of this quantity .",
    "+ in this work we show that in order to detect relevant photoinduced effects in the band structure of silicene under strong circularly polarized electromagnetic radiation in the terahertz ( frequency ) domain one needs to go beyond the aforementioned off resonant approximation . at intermediate coupling regime",
    "we reproduce the single valley dirac phase reported by ezawa@xcite and we show that effective dynamical gap closing occurs at or above the intermediate coupling regime of the dirac fermions to the radiation field . by exact evaluation of the zero - momentum pseudospin polarization",
    "we find that pseudospin inversion can only be dynamically achieved at intermediate or strong coupling of the charge carriers to the radiation field and thus , the off resonant modifications induced in the band structure turn out to be a rather small effect .",
    "this is verified by a numerical evaluation of the time - averaged density of states . + the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the model and obtain the quasienergy spectrum along with the exact zero - momentum dynamical polarization . in section",
    "iii we present our results for the finite momentum quasienergy spectrum as well as the density of states ( dos ) . in section",
    "iv we discuss the main results and give some concluding remarks .",
    "we adopt the dirac cone approximation to describe the dynamics of non interacting charge carriers in silicene subject to a perpendicular , uniform and constant electric field @xmath3 .",
    "this is given by the @xmath4 hamiltonian@xcite ( @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the electron s charge ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fermi velocity for charge carriers in silicene , with @xmath9  the lattice constant and @xmath10 the hopping parameter within a tight - binding formulation , whereas @xmath11 measures half the separation among the two sublattice planes .",
    "in addition , @xmath12 describes the dirac point , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) are pauli matrices describing pseudo and real spin degrees of freedom , respectively , whereas the time reversal symmetry of the two dirac points can be encoded in the momentum as @xmath16 , i.e. , it is the momentum measured from the corresponding dirac point @xmath17 . following reference , we are using a cooordinate system with the @xmath18 axis being perpendicular to the two inequivalent silicon atoms in the unit cell .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 represents the strength of the intrinsic spin - orbit contribution .",
    "moreover , the two contributions given by the terms @xmath20 describe the spin - orbit coupling associated to the next nearest neighbor hopping and nearest neighbors tight binding formulation , respectively .",
    "+ the term @xmath21 has its origin in the buckled structure of silicene whereas @xmath22 is induced by the application of an external static electric field @xmath2 .",
    "using first principle calculations , the authors of reference @xcite found that @xmath23 for a typical electric field @xmath24 whereas @xmath22 is of order @xmath25 for a critical electric field @xmath26 . in this manner",
    ", @xmath22 is much smaller than the other energy scales in the problem .",
    "therefore , these two non conserving contributions will be neglected in the following , although in the appendix we show that the largest contribution @xmath21 can be easily incorporated in the solution to the dynamical evolution presented below .",
    "yet , we have verified that our results do not qualitatively change by the introduction of these two small corrections .    within the approximation @xmath27 ,",
    "let us now consider the pseudospin dynamics under an _ intense _ radiation field represented by the time - dependent vector potential @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 its amplitude and frequency , respectively .",
    "it describes a monochromatic electromagnetic wave incident perpendicular to the sample .",
    "this vector potential can in turn be derived from the corresponding electric field by means of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the amplitude of the time - dependent electric field .    using the standard minimal coupling prescription given as @xmath33",
    ", we get the dynamical generator @xmath34.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the following we will explore the emerging photoinduced dynamical features at different momentum scenarios . for this purpose , we explore the low , intermediate and strong coupling regimes of the charge carriers in silicene under the radiation field .      at zero momentum the extrinsic spin - orbit term @xmath21 vanishes and the z - component of spin @xmath36 is a good quantum number . therefore , the following analysis is independent of taking into account the aforementioned spin - orbit contribution . setting for notational convenience @xmath37 and @xmath38 ,",
    "the physics at zero momentum @xmath39 is described by the dynamical generator @xmath40.\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this equation we note that the sublattice degree of freedom must be included in the total angular momentum of the system in order to account for conservation of this quantity as a consequence of the rotational invariance of the system that is preserved in absence of rashba spin - orbit terms .",
    "this was another motivation for studying the zero - momentum pseudospin modifications induced by the radiation field .",
    "now if we apply the unitary transformation @xmath41 we get the effective time - independent floquet hamiltonian @xmath42 @xmath43\\sigma_z+\\alpha\\sigma_x.\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     yet , under intense terahertz radiation , the conditions that lead to the derivation of the last term in eq .",
    "( [ offfin ] ) are not satisfied and therefore , appreciable photoinduced effective gap modulation requires a full tratment of the dynamical equations .",
    "for instance , if we consider values of the electric field intensities@xcite @xmath44 and frequencies in the far infrared domain@xcite for which @xmath45 , one gets for the coupling constant @xmath46 ( for a chosen frequency value of @xmath47 thz ) . therefore , higher order harmonics do contribute and the dynamics must be given a full numerical treatment by fourier transforming the schrdinger equation , and solving the resulting infinite dimensional static eigenvalue problem .",
    "+ however , we still can get a time - independent formulation since the static hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) commutes with the total angular momentum operator @xmath48 thus , applying the unitary transformation @xmath49 we get the effective time - independent floquet hamiltonian @xmath50 this form of the floquet hamiltonian is appropriate to evaluate approximate analytical solutions to the dynamics , but we will not follow this semi analytic approach . instead , in the following we present numerical solutions to the finite momentum dynamics for the coupling regime @xmath51 , with @xmath52 the hopping parameter in the tight binding formulation .",
    "+ now we present the quasienergy spectra at finite momentum which are obtained by a numerical diagonalization of the periodic hamiltonian given in equation ( [ e11 t ] ) . in fig.[fig : figure2 ] we present the momentum dependence of the quasienergy spectrum within the low ( @xmath53 ) and intermediate ( @xmath54 ) coupling regimes to the radiation field . here",
    "we have neglected the extrinsic spin - orbit contributions @xmath21 and @xmath22 . yet , the effects of the most important contribution @xmath21 can be readily incorporated as it is described in the appendix .",
    "we have checked that our results do not qualitatively differ when this extrinsic spin - orbit contribution is included .",
    "since the static band structure properties are determined by the sign of the static bandgap @xmath55 , we have selected two sets of significant values of this parameter as it is shown by the red ( black ) , thick curves in fig.[fig : figure2 ] for positive ( negative ) values of the static gap at low @xmath56 and intermediate @xmath57 absolute values of the static gap , respectively .",
    "the changes in the static bandgap are controlled through the static electric field @xmath2 .",
    "since the circularly polarized radiation introduces an isotropic modulation of the quasienergy spectrum , we can set the value of one of the momentum components , say @xmath58 without loss of generality .",
    "+ from the zero energy solution discussed above we have to take into account that the radiation field also modulates the gap , both through its frequency and amplitude .",
    "therefore , in order to have a reference for indicating qualitative changes in the band structure we have chosen the quasienergy spectrum for @xmath59 ( thin lines in fig.[fig : figure2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , for finite values of @xmath60 , we use thick arrows that point , for either subband , away from the zero bandgap curve signaling how the energy bands are `` pulled away '' in presence of the radiation field . from the results shown in fig.[fig : figure2 ] we see that at low coupling ( @xmath61 ) , the main modifications of the energy spectrum are due to the value of the static bandgap .",
    "this is true for both positive ( red , thick curves ) and negative ( black , thick curves ) values of @xmath60 .",
    "yet , at intermediate values of the light - matter coupling strength ( @xmath54 ) , we can infer that the driving field is the leading mechanism in modifying the quasienergy spectrum .",
    "in fact , as can be seen in the red thick curve ( corresponding to @xmath57 ) , at intermediate coupling regime ( @xmath54 ) , the effective bandgap of one of the pseudospin states can be closed at @xmath57 .",
    "this in turn signals the onset of the single dirac cone configuration ( red , thick curve in the rightmost panel ) .",
    "however , it is physically distinct in nature to that reported by ezawa in @xcite since it is due to real instead of virtual photon emission and absortion processes .      to complement the physical picture given before , in this section we present the results for the time - averaged density of states obtained through the expression@xcite @xmath62,\\ ] ] where the floquet eigenstates @xmath63 and the quasienergies @xmath64",
    "are defined via @xmath65    in fig.[fig : figure3 ] we show the resulting time - averaged dos within the low ( intermediate ) coupling regime @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) of the dirac fermions to the radiation field . we have taken as a reference the driven ungapped scenario @xmath59 , shown by the black dashed curve in order to explicitly show the interplay among the driving field and the static gap since for @xmath59 no physical configuration of the two pseudospin components would lead to the single dirac cone phase . however , in the inset ( d ) we can see that for a finite value of @xmath57 and at intermediate coupling regime , one configuration is non gapped ( black , continous curve ) for @xmath57 , whereas the other ( red , continous curve ) for @xmath66 , is gapped and thus one can achieve the driven single- dirac cone configuration by properly tuning the ratio of the amplitude / frequency of the driven field at this intermediate light - matter coupling values .",
    "we have theoretically analyzed the photoinduced effects on a monolayer of silicene subject to intense terahertz circularly polarized electromagnetic radiation .",
    "we have shown that dynamical gap modulation of the quasienergy spectrum can only occur for large enough coupling strenght regimes of the light - matter interaction effective parameter @xmath67 .",
    "we found that for frequencies @xmath30 within the range of the undriven bandgap real photon emission and absortion resonant processes induce a ",
    "band inversion  that changes the qualitative bandgap structure of driven silicene .",
    "therefore , the intermediate coupling regime qualitatively reproduces the single dirac dynamical structure predicted in reference@xcite but with real instead of virtual photon resonant processes and therefore , the obeservation of the physical realization of this topological phase could be achieved at more realistic values of the strength of the light - matter coupling parameter .",
    "these distinct phases are correlated to the averaged out of plane pseudospin polarization parameter oscillations which in turn stem from the angular momentum exchange among the charge carries and the electromagnetic field .",
    "we would like to add that performing a rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) would not be suitable to the regime under consideration since the corresponding rwa solutions can only properly describe the dynamics for small values of the coupling constant ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "we also note that considering another semianalytical approximation , such as the magnus expansion@xcite could provide some explicit formulae for both the quasienergy spectrum and floquet eigenstates . yet",
    ", this approach has the drawback that truncating the series leads to a violation of the stroboscopic relation which should be a general property of solutions to the dynamics of the periodically driven systems@xcite . from an experimental point of view",
    "we consider that the angular momentum exchange between the radiation field and the pseudospin degree of freedom could be detected by measuring the changes in the polarization state of the reflected radiation from the silicene sample by means of the magneto optic kerr effect as it has already been used for detecting real spin effects in semiconducting structures@xcite .",
    "we consider that our proposed scheme could shed light on the relevance of the pseudospin for practical implementations of this degree of freedom in realistic pseudospintronics applications .",
    "we would also briefly discuss two additional points that are in order to better understand the physics of our proposed model .",
    "on the one hand , we mention that in order to take into account non - radiative recombination processes one should introduce an electron - phonon coupling which was considered in a recent paper by mariani and von oppen@xcite where they have shown that inclusion of this electron - phonon interaction due to transverse or flexural phonos in graphene could lead to distinguishable temperature dependences of the single layer graphene resistivity .",
    "this is in turn due to the fact that flexural phonons dominate the phonon contribution to the resistivity .",
    "we could expect that these effects should be present in monolayer silicene and would be the focus of future work where one could discuss the interplay between photon and phonon couplings to the dirac fermions in silicene . on the other hand , one could also be interested in addressing the role of scattering effects at finite momenta . in this context",
    ", it has been recently shown by zhai and jin in reference@xcite that , within the off resonant approximation for epitaxial graphene , the photon dressing of the static eigenstates leads to an assymetry between the scattering amplitudes for the inter and intravalley conductances .",
    "this is explained as a consequence of the degeneracy lifting of the valley degree of freedom which is due to the time reversal symmetry breaking introduced by the electromagnetic radiation field .",
    "therefore , we propose that within our setup the pseudospin conductance would have a similar asymmetry but the measurability of this asymmetry could be experimentally tested within a more realistic set of parameters since , as we have previously discussed in this work , the measurable effects of physical changes within the off resonant assumption are far to small to have observable consequences .",
    "following the discussion presented in section iii , in this appendix we summarize the block diagonalization procedure of the hamiltonian to take into account the extrinsic spin - orbit correction @xmath21 . for simplicity ,",
    "let us focus on the @xmath69 dirac point ( @xmath70 ) where we have the @xmath71 hamiltonian @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "if we now define @xmath76 and perform a unitary transformation with @xmath77 with @xmath78 , we get @xmath79 we can further transform the previous hamiltonian as @xmath80 to get a block diagonal form @xmath81 where the unitary transformation has the explicit form @xmath82 and @xmath83 is chosen to get rid of the off - diagonal terms . for this purpose",
    "we have introduced the @xmath71 matrix @xmath84 with @xmath85 the @xmath86 identity matrix . after some straightforward algebra one gets the condition for block diagonalization to fix the angle by the parameter relation @xmath87 .",
    "then , the diagonal subblocks in eq.([1 ] ) read @xmath88 where the effective momentum dependent spin - orbit correction is defined as @xmath89 .    under inversion of the transformation ( [ t1 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath90 , we find that the upper diagonal subblock of equation ( [ 1 ] ) reads now @xmath91 where we have simplified the notation by setting the static gap as @xmath92 .",
    "following the decimation method presented by medina and pastawski @xcite , we present now a brief discussion on the derivation of the effective hamiltonian within the off resonant approximation for the periodic floquet hamiltonian @xmath93 , as it is given in equation ( [ general ] ) , where @xmath94 is the static contribution and @xmath95 is the time - periodic interaction . transforming to fourier space",
    "we get the floquet hamiltonian for a monochromatic perturbation in matrix form given in tridiagonal form as @xmath96 where the interaction submatrices are defined as @xmath97 and we have set @xmath98 . if we set out the eigenstate for a given number of fourier modes @xmath99 we will have @xmath100 + with each @xmath101 being a vector of dimensionality determined by @xmath94 . for instance , if we approximate the problem in such a way that we only consider one fourier mode ( @xmath102 ) , we have to solve the following system of coupled equations @xmath103 from the first and last equations we get @xmath104 such that we get an effective equation for @xmath105      for @xmath107 , i.e. , frequencies much larger than the typical energy scales of the static problem , we can simplify the denominators and approximate the previous equation as @xmath108 so we get the effective approximate floquet hamiltonian , valid for large frequencies @xmath109}{\\omega}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a similar procedure one can show that for @xmath110 one gets the approximate floquet hamiltonian @xmath111}{\\omega}-\\frac{1}{2\\omega}\\frac{[v^2_{-1},v^2_{+1}]}{\\omega^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] _ acknowledgments _ this work has been supported by deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft via grk 1570 and by yachay ep through a grant from senescyt .",
