    "in various fields of applications , such as topological robotics , configuration spaces of mechanical systems depend on a large number of parameters , which typically are only partially known and often can be considered as random variables . since these parameters determine the topology of the configuration space , the latter can be viewed in such a case as a _ random topological space _ or a _ random manifold_. to control such a system one has to understand geometry , topology and control theory of random manifolds .",
    "one of the most natural notion to investigate is the mathematical expectation of the betti numbers of random manifolds .",
    "clearly , these average betti numbers encode valuable information for engineering applications ; for instance they provide an average lower bound for the number of critical points of a morse function ( i.e. observable ) on such manifolds .",
    "in this paper we consider a specific instance of this general problem .",
    "we study closed planar @xmath0-gons whose sides have fixed lengths @xmath1 where @xmath2 for @xmath3 .",

    "space @xmath4 parametrizes the variety of all possible shapes of such planar @xmath0-gons with sides of length @xmath1 .",
    "the unit vector @xmath5 indicates the direction of the @xmath6-th side of the polygon .",
    "the condition @xmath7 expresses the property of the polygon being closed .",
    "the rotation group @xmath8 acts on the set of side directions @xmath9 diagonally .",
    "the polygon space @xmath10 emerges in topological robotics as the configuration space of the planar linkage , a simple mechanism consisting of @xmath0 bars of length @xmath1 connected by revolving joints forming a closed planar polygonal chain .",
    "the positions of two adjacent vertices are fixed but the other vertices are free to move and the angles between the bars are allowed to change .    the spaces @xmath10 also appear in molecular biology where they describe the space of shapes of closed molecular chains .",
    "statistical shape theory is another subject where the spaces @xmath10 play a role : they describe the space of shapes having certain geometric properties with respect to the central point , see @xcite .",
    "the configuration space @xmath10 depends on the length vector @xmath11 in an essential way . here",
    "@xmath12 denotes the set of vectors in @xmath13 having nonnegative coordinates .",
    "clearly , @xmath14 for any @xmath15    the length vector @xmath16 is called _ generic _ if @xmath17 for any choice @xmath18 .",

    "the moduli spaces @xmath10 of planar polygonal linkages were studied extensively by w. thurston and j. weeks @xcite , k. walker @xcite , a. a. klyachko @xcite , m. kapovich and j. millson @xcite , j .- cl .",

    "we study in detail two special choices for @xmath22 :    _ _    1 .",
    "@xmath27 is the probability measure on @xmath12 supported on the unit simplex @xmath28 such that @xmath29 coincides with the lebesgue measure on @xmath30 normalized so that @xmath31 .",

    "more precisely , our main result is the following :    [ thm1 ] let @xmath22 be either of the measures @xmath45 or @xmath46 described above",
    ". then for any @xmath41 there exist constants @xmath47 and @xmath48 such that for any @xmath0 the average betti number @xmath49 , given by ( [ barbi ] ) , satisfies @xmath50    this result appears quite surprising for two reasons .",
    "firstly , it states that the asymptotic values of the average betti number @xmath51 as @xmath52 are equal for the measures @xmath45 and @xmath46 and raises the intriguing question about the universality of the obtained asymptotic values .",
    "secondly , the binomial coefficient which appears in estimate ( [ ineqthm1 ] ) equals the @xmath23-dimensional betti number @xmath53 of the configuration space of the equilateral linkage @xmath54 for any @xmath23 satisfying @xmath55 , see @xcite , examples 3 & 4 . hence the betti numbers of the moduli space @xmath56 approximate the average betti numbers @xmath51 for @xmath0 large . on the other hand , by theorem 2 of @xcite",
    "the total betti number , @xmath57 viewed as a function of the length vector @xmath58 , is maximal for the equilateral linkage @xmath59 .",
    "this comparison shows that at least for some values of @xmath23 the maximum of the individual betti numbers @xmath24 viewed as a function of @xmath16 must be higher than @xmath60 .",

    "however if @xmath65 then @xmath66    in a subsequent work we shall describe a generalization of theorem [ thm1 ] which allows the dimension @xmath23 to grow with @xmath0 .",
    "in this section we express the average betti numbers in terms of certain volumes .",
