    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 have the dimension of angular momentum , to be measured in units @xmath15 . for the moment",
    "we suppose that the spin quantum number @xmath16 is an integer .    the term @xmath17 tries to generate a rotation about the @xmath18-axis and",

    "it certainly does so for @xmath19 . for arbitrary nonzero @xmath8 the degeneracy in the spectrum of @xmath20",
    "is lifted and no tunneling can occur _ unless _ a special choice of @xmath8 is made that restores the degeneracy . for @xmath21",
    "a degeneracy exists , if @xmath22 for some integers @xmath23 and @xmath24 , i.e. , putting @xmath25 , @xmath26 in passing we note that both @xmath27 and @xmath8 have the dimension of frequency . equation ( [ 3 ] ) tells us @xmath28 so that with @xmath29 we are left with @xmath30 where @xmath31 is chosen to be a positive integer .",
    "hence @xmath32 .",
    "the remarkable aspect of this condition is that it can be realized for _ all _ @xmath24 in the ballpark @xmath33 .",

    "one has exploited the fact that the anisotropy is _ quadratic _ in @xmath14 .",
    "the variable parameter @xmath8 is at the disposal of the experimentalist and the corresponding magnetic field is usually increased from minus to plus a few tesla .",
    "one then finds @xcite@xcite several resonances in between .",
    "it is fair to say that the above setup is indeed elegant .",
    "it is a corollary of semiclassical quantization as treated in the present paper that the resonance condition ( [ 5 ] ) also holds for @xmath35 .",
    "the ( tiny ) level splitting is a consequence of quantum mechanics .",
    "meanwhile resonance has been studied intensively .",
    "already those who invented it initiated a first attempt @xcite at its theoretical understanding . in an admirable _ tour de force _ , chudnovsky and garanin @xcite were able to fully analyze the influence of the heat bath provided by the surroundings of the spins on the tunneling process if @xmath36 , and there is little doubt that their arguments can be generalized to the @xmath37 case .",
    "here we assume a much lower temperature so that the heat bath can be neglected .",
    "the analysis of semiclassical quantization , including resonance , is the main theme of the present paper .",
    "it yields the energy eigenvalues of the hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) to a good approximation and thus completes our earlier work @xcite on the wkb formalism for spins ; we refer the reader to the excellent review @xcite for additional information regarding the experimental and theoretical context . in  2 we reconsider the wkb formalism and indicate the use of the wkb wave functions in computing the level splitting at resonance .",

    "the conclusion is that semiclassical quantization holds here too but that for even @xmath41 the condition ( [ 3 ] ) may correspond to true degeneracy ; that is , no resonance and no tunneling .",

    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] ) are solutions of the eigenvalue equation @xmath42 . the @xmath14 axis being the main anisotropy axis , it is natural to write this equation in a representation with @xmath14 diagonal .",

    "disregarding the remaining two equations , relation ( [ sch ] ) has two linearly independent solutions for _ any _ value of @xmath52 ; they are determined by fixing , e.g. , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath1 eigenvalues of @xmath55 are singled out by requiring that @xmath56 satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath57 equivalently , we can extend ( [ sch ] ) to @xmath58 by defining arbitrary real @xmath59 and imposing the boundary conditions @xmath60 .",

    "it is interesting to note that , as the energy increases while avoiding accidental degeneracies ( [ 3 ] ) , the eigenvectors are alternately localized on the ` right ' ( @xmath63 ) or on the ` left ' ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "far from degeneracy an approximate localization on alternating sides remains true for a nonvanishing @xmath7 , if @xmath65 , which is supposed throughout the paper .    by varying @xmath8",
    ", neighbouring eigenvalues can get very close to each other , although true degeneracy can not occur @xcite . as we discuss below",
    ", the mechanism of the avoided level crossing is spin tunneling .",
    "when two eigenvalues become as close as possible , we speak of a _ quantum - mechanical resonance_. this has to be distinguished from what we call a _ semiclassical resonance _ , which we understand to be the coincidence of semiclassical eigenvalues .",
    "we shall prove in  4 that the condition for a semiclassical resonance remains ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "apart from the resonance at @xmath66 , we can not expect that the two definitions predict the same ` resonant ' values for @xmath8 . because , however , semiclassical eigenvalues nicely approximate the true ones , only a small ` fine tuning ' of @xmath8 may be necessary to pass from semiclassical to true , quantum - mechanical , resonance . in the remaining part of this section",
    "we explain how one can estimate the level splitting at resonance .",
    "let us choose @xmath8 close to a resonant value and let @xmath67 be two ( unknown ) neighbouring , nearly degenerate , eigenvalues .",
    "let us also imagine that we are given two linearly independent vectors @xmath68 and @xmath69 which depend continuously on @xmath52 and solve ( [ sch ] ) . to avoid all confusion , we emphasize that no linear combination of them satisfies the boundary conditions ( [ bc ] ) and , hence , the eigenvalue equation , if @xmath52 is not an eigenvalue . on the other hand ,",
    "the eigenvector belonging to @xmath70 is a linear combination of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and its analog holds for @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath74 and @xmath75 be the semiclassical eigenvalues corresponding to @xmath70 and @xmath73 , respectively . because all four energies are now close to each other , we can replace @xmath71 and @xmath76 by @xmath77 , and @xmath72 and @xmath78 by @xmath79 , or _ vice versa_. in this way , finding @xmath70 and @xmath73 _ and _ the corresponding eigenvectors reduces to good approximation to diagonalizing @xmath55 in a two - dimensional subspace . in so doing , we can use the wkb method to obtain @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "though wentzel , kramers , and brillouin ( wkb ) never considered spins , their idea is applicable here too , provided one generalizes the formalism appropriately @xcite so as to take care of the discrete nature of a spin and its different commutation relations as compared to a particle .",
    "a semiclassical analysis formally means that we take the limit @xmath82 and at the same time @xmath83 in such a way that @xmath84 remains constant . in this limit",
    "we are left with a continuum description with @xmath85 ranging in the interval @xmath86 $ ] . in the spirit of wkb",
    "we now make the ansatz @xmath87 with @xmath88 for the wave function we are looking for , expand everything in powers of @xmath15 , and usually stop after the first - order term , the zeroth - order one being dominant .",

    "we write the matrix of @xmath55 ( for @xmath41 even ) in the basis of the @xmath50-eigenvectors @xmath331 . by noticing that @xmath332 whenever @xmath333 is odd",

    "in other words , every second ( expected ) step would be missing .",
    "unfortunately , an experiment in an applied magnetic field usually has a transverse component that induces steps at the remaining integer values .",

    "if so , one could apply semiclassical quantization (  3 ) to arbitrary numerical precision but the amount of insight thus obtained is fairly restricted .",

    "one would like to focus on states with @xmath23 and @xmath24 closer to zero since , in resonance , the tunneling frequency is much higher . as a consequence , the afore mentioned assumption may , but need not , hold .",

    "we will not pursue this idea here .",
    "collecting terms of order @xmath384 we find @xmath385 and arrive at ( [ 18a ] ) , as advertised .",
