    "despite several decades of intense scrutiny , our understanding of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) remains incomplete .",
    "fundamental issues such as the number density of agn , their contributions to the far - infrared and x - ray backgrounds , the role of orientation to our line of sight , the processes that form and power the nuclei , and their evolution still need to be resolved .",
    "recent large - scale x - ray , optical , and near - infrared surveys have begun to reveal new populations of agn with number densities comparable to , or exceeding , the number density of agn derived from previous optical and radio surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is finding large numbers of agn that have been missed by traditional uv / optical search techniques .",
    "new survey wavebands can uncover past observational biases and reveal a wider range of agn properties .",
    "polarization is an important property that can be used to explore the physics and structure of agn , and polarimetry yields valuable information about the various classes of active nuclei .",
    "for instance , early surveys of the most luminous known agn  quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) and quasi - stellar radio sources ( quasars )  showed that they could be divided into two classes by their optical polarization properties @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of objects , both radio and optically selected , show low optical polarization ( @xmath6% ; @xcite ) .",
    "about 1% of the sample exhibited higher and variable polarization @xcite , in part earning them the designation of optically violent variable quasars ( ovvs ) .",
    "almost all of these objects are associated with compact radio sources , and their variability behavior , both in flux and in polarization , clearly signifies that optically thin synchrotron radiation dominates the uv / optical continua .",
    "identification of the polarization mechanism(s ) in low - polarization qsos has not been as straightforward largely because of the low levels of polarization encountered . except for a handful of broad absorption - line qsos ( balqsos ; @xcite ) and qsos discovered by the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) @xcite , only the ovvs exhibit polarization above the traditional high - polarization threshold of @xmath7% . a good illustration of the difficulty in identifying the polarizing mechanism in most qsos is provided by the blue - excess palomar - green ( pg ) sample @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that this predominantly radio - quiet sample has a mean intrinsic optical polarization of only 0.5% and the maximum observed polarization is 2.5% .",
    "unambiguous statistical tests designed to determine the source of the polarized flux have been extremely hard to obtain , even though high quality broad - band polarimetry exists for the entire pg qso sample .    this is not the case for the the lower luminosity analogs to radio - quiet qsos , the seyfert  1 galaxies .",
    "these objects show overall polarization properties similar to the pg qsos , but their polarization distribution extends to higher values .",
    "the high - polarization seyfert  1 `` tail '' better facilitates comparison of the polarization distribution with dust extinction and dust emission indicators , and led @xcite to conclude that the primary polarizing mechanism in seyfert  1s is the scattering of nuclear light by dust located within the narrow emission - line region ( nlr ) .",
    "variations of this mechanism have been successful in explaining the polarization of several seyfert  2 galaxies and showing that these objects would look like seyfert  1s if viewed from sightlines that intercept the scattering material and the nlr ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "_ iras _ found a small number of infrared - luminous agn which suggest the existence of a population of red , optically - obscured radio - quiet qsos @xcite .",
    "spectropolarimetry of several of these `` hyperluminous '' infrared galaxies ( higs ) has confirmed that their tremendous ir luminosities are powered in large part by qsos hidden from our direct view , and that polarization arises from scattering of nuclear light by material with a relatively unobstructed view of the agn @xcite .",
    "a similar situation has been found for several radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "for these objects , light scattered by dust located up to several kiloparsecs from the nucleus reveals the rest - frame ultraviolet spectrum of a qso hidden from our direct view .",
    "@xcite have initiated a near - infrared , high galactic latitude survey for agn using 2mass .",
    "the survey is designed to find new red , radio - quiet objects and has , in fact , revealed a large population of previously unidentified agn .",
    "the new sample generally consists of low - redshift ( @xmath8 ) objects with redder near - ir colors ( a criterion of the object selection ) and much higher near - ir  to  optical flux ratios than optically selected agn .",
    "many of these agn can be classified as qsos in their own right since their @xmath0-band luminosities are comparable to those of optically selected qsos .    higher levels of optical polarization relative to uv - excess qsos are expected from the 2mass sample if , as with the ir - selected higs , many of these objects are obscured along our line of sight .",
    "nuclear light scattered by material ( dust and/or electrons ) distributed around the agn will make a larger contribution to the total observed flux than if , as inferred for optically selected qsos , we have a direct , unobstructed view to the bright unpolarized nucleus .",
    "given an asymmetric distribution and/or illumination of the scattering material , high polarization can result .",
    "the 2mass agn survey presents a large , well - defined sample of qsos that invites comparisons with agn selected by other means . in this paper",
    "we present observations of 2mass qsos aimed at determining their broad - band optical polarization properties .",
    "we test the conclusion reached by @xcite , based on the near - ir colors of the sample , that some of the objects in the general low-@xmath9 qso population found by 2mass are obscured along our line of sight .",
    "in addition , the polarization distribution of the new near - ir  selected qsos is compared to three largely radio - quiet qso samples ( pg , balqso , and _ iras _ higs ) for which polarization data are available .",
    "the objects selected for observation were 89 spectroscopically - confirmed agn from @xcite .",

    "mostly because of the relatively bright limiting apparent magnitudes and color selection of the 2mass agn survey , all of the objects observed in the polarimetry program have confirmed redshifts @xmath22 except 2m092145 and 2m234905 .",
    "we have excluded the objects listed in table  2 from the analysis of the 2mass qso sample so that we can solely concentrate on the polarization properties of a well - defined low - redshift sample and allow for a more straightforward comparison of these properties with other qsos in this redshift range .",

    "inclusion of the 21 higher - redshift pg qsos does not change the obvious difference between the general polarization levels of the two samples , since the highest polarization observed in the entire pg catalog is @xmath53% for pg  1114 + 445 ( @xmath54 ) and pg  1425 + 267 ( @xmath55 ) . for the purposes of comparisons between the pg and 2mass qsos ,",
    "the pg sample will be limited to the 75 qsos with @xmath50 and @xmath56 .",
    "the distributions of optical polarization show a dramatic difference between optically selected qsos represented by the pg sample , and near - ir selected agn having similar @xmath0-band luminosities ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the high polarization of the 2mass qsos relative to uv / optically selected qsos supports the conclusion that the red near - ir colors and high near - ir  to  optical flux ratios arise from some degree of obscuration by dust in our line of sight .",
    "extinction and reddening by dust bias these objects against discovery in traditional optical ( uv - excess ) agn surveys .",
    "high polarization is expected from a reddened , partially obscured qso population either because of the transmission of agn light through aligned dust grains ( the interstellar polarization mechanism ) within the agn host galaxy , or the scattering of nuclear light by material distributed fairly close to the agn .",
    "optical spectropolarimetric results for several highly polarized 2mass qsos support the view that scattering of nuclear light in regions near the nucleus is indeed the dominant polarizing mechanism @xcite , and not dichroic absorption by aligned dust grains . polarized light from analogous scattering regions in uv",
    "/ optically selected qsos appears to be completely swamped by the unpolarized , direct light from the nucleus , leading to the low polarization observed for most qsos measured in past surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we further explore this conclusion in the following sections .",
    "if dust obscuration in our line of sight plays a role in producing the high optical polarization of 2mass qsos relative to presumably unobscured qsos found optically , then a correlation might be expected between polarization and color in the sense that redder , more obscured objects would tend to be highly polarized .",
    "figures  2 and 3 show the observed polarization as a function of @xmath58 and @xmath59 color indices , respectively . the pg qsos with @xmath50",
    "are also plotted in both figures using data from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is readily apparent , especially with respect to @xmath59 , that the likelihood of detecting @xmath3% is higher for redder objects .",
    "a non - parametric correlation test ( kendall s tau ) applied to 2mass sample confirms the trends suggested in figures  2 and 3 , and these results are summarized in table  4 .",
    "the probability of finding a correlation this strong between polarization and @xmath58 or @xmath59 if these parameters are uncorrelated is @xmath60% .",
    "high polarization is observed over the range of @xmath61 spanned by the 2mass sample , though most 2mass qsos with @xmath62 have @xmath6% .",
    "the three objects with @xmath63 are also not highly polarized .",
    "it is interesting to note that the near - ir color criterion for selection into the 2mass sample seems to be near something of a threshold for observing high polarization .",
    "three of the nine highly polarized 2mass qsos are at the red end of the @xmath58 range spanned by the pg sample ( @xmath64 ) , although none of the 12 pg qsos that meet the 2mass color selection criterion have @xmath65% .",
    "the @xmath59 color index is much more sensitive to the presence of dust in our line of sight to the agn than @xmath58 , and as expected , the 2mass qsos span a range of at least 5.7 magnitudes in @xmath59 .",
    "four objects are undetected in the blue palomar digital sky survey ( dss ) .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the low-@xmath9 pg qsos that span only about 2 magnitudes in @xmath59 .",
    "all qsos with @xmath3% have @xmath66 with the exception of 2m151653 ( @xmath67 ; @xmath68% ) .",
    "if the 2mass qsos are similar to pg qsos except that they are obscured by dust , high polarization objects appear in the sample when there is @xmath691.5  mag of visual extinction of the direct nuclear light above that experienced by an average pg qso .",
    "a strong trend is observed among the 2mass qsos between optical polarization and the near - ir luminosity inferred from the apparent @xmath0 magnitudes ( figure  4 and table  4 ) .",
    "six of the 10 most luminous objects at 2.2@xmath70 m are highly polarized , and all objects with @xmath3% have @xmath71 .",
    "there are two probable effects that might preferentially select intrinsically luminous qsos in this sample to be highly polarized .",
    "first , under the assumption that 2.2@xmath70 m brightness is a more accurate measure of intrinsic luminosity than optical brightness , the most luminous objects are better able to illuminate scattering regions distributed around the nuclear source .",
    "brighter and/or more extensive scattering regions around the nucleus will generally result in more polarized , scattered light that contributes a larger fraction to the total observed flux .",
    "the second effect is the suppression of polarization by unpolarized sources of optical light such as starlight from the host galaxy .",
    "the relative contribution of the host galaxy to the total flux is typically higher for lower luminosity agn , and therefore , the observed polarization is lower .",
    "the 2mass agn sample has no morphological selection criteria and inspection of the dss and frames obtained from the imaging polarimetry easily reveal host galaxies for many of the 2mass qsos . in several cases , the extended galactic emission outshines the qso in the optical .",
    "for instance , only @xmath3350% of the @xmath24-band flux measured in a 20-diameter aperture for 2m022150 is included in a 6 aperture . by comparison , sophisticated optical observational techniques or near - ir imaging",
    "have typically been required to detect the host galaxies of uv / optically selected qsos ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "clearly , the effect on the measured optical polarization by host galaxy starlight will tend to be greater for the 2mass sample than it is for other qso samples .",
    "this issue is discussed further in  3.4 and  4 .",
    "one of the hallmarks of the 2mass color - selected sample is the wide variety of agn types revealed by optical spectroscopy @xcite . the full range of agn emission - line spectral types are represented in the 70 2mass qsos , from type 1 to type 2/liner .",
    "a majority of the objects show some evidence for broad emission lines ( type  11.9 ) with only 9 objects not showing a broad component in their balmer line profiles .    we have divided the qso sample into categories using the spectral classifications determined by @xcite : type 1 ( 22 objects ; which includes type  1.2 objects ) , type  1.5 ( 19 objects ) , and type  1.82/liner / starburst ( 15 objects ) . objects that show broad h@xmath72 emission lines , but whose available spectra either do not include h@xmath73 ( `` type  1.b '' ; 3 objects ) , or have no detected h@xmath73 emission line ( `` type  1.x '' ; 10 objects )",
    "have been combined into a fourth category ( type  1 . ?",
    "spectral classification has been ambiguous for 2m232745 and we have included it with the type  1.x and 1.b objects .",
    "the properties of these categories and the @xmath50 pg qsos are summarized in table  5 .",
    "inspection of figures  2 , 3 , or 4 reveals that all categories , with the exception of type  1 . ?",
    ", are represented among the nine highly polarized examples . over",
    "one quarter of the 19 qsos classified as type  1.5 are highly polarized . in the case of 2m165939",
    ", the polarized flux spectrum shows a blue continuum , broad balmer emission lines , and that the nlr features are unpolarized @xcite . although there is a broad emission - line component in the total flux spectrum ,",
    "these polarization properties imply that the agn is partially hidden from our direct view .",
    "moreover , the scattering material must lie further away from the continuum source than the broad emission - line region ( blr ) , but be close to , or within the nlr .",
    "the relative lack of high polarization among type  1 objects ( two of 22 objects ) is reminiscent of the @xmath50 pg sample that is composed of type  11.5 objects ( adopting the classifications compiled by @xcite ) , where none have @xmath3% .",
    "although 2mass detects redder type  1 objects , many that are presumably reddened by dust , direct unpolarized light from the nucleus is apparently still strong enough to swamp any scattered , polarized light sources . alternatively , as with any of the low - polarization objects , the scattered light component could also be reddened ,",
    "keeping its contribution to total observed flux too small to yield @xmath3% .",
    "one of the two highly polarized type  1 qsos , 2m151653 , has been shown by @xcite to be polarized in the same manner as 2m165939 .",
    "that is , material close to or within the nlr scatters light into our line of sight from an active nucleus partially obscured from our direct view .",
    "all of the highly polarized qsos discovered in this survey exhibit evidence for a broad - line region in their total flux spectra , albeit weakly in the cases of 2m010835 ( type  1.9 ; @xmath74 ) and 2m171559 ( type  1.8 ; @xmath75 ) .",
    "therefore , the high polarization of the 2mass sample is not the result of the inclusion of type  2 objects with hidden continuum sources and blrs like those that exist in several highly polarized seyfert  2 nuclei ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    on the other hand , the two highly polarized narrow emission",
    "line - dominated objects are the most luminous objects of their type in the sample .",
    "no other type  1.82 objects have @xmath76 and all but 2m145410 , 2m163736 , and 2m230304 have @xmath77 . within the context of the unified agn scheme , type  2 objects",
    "are thought to be more heavily obscured by dust than type  1s .",
    "this naturally explains why the @xmath0 luminosity of the type  2 objects is generally lower than that of type  11.5 and why @xmath59 is typically larger for type  2s ( table  5 ) .",
    "the prevalence of intermediate - type qsos among the highly polarized 2mass qsos suggests that unpolarized light sources dilute the optical polarization of objects of more extreme spectral type .",
    "type  2 objects may exhibit low polarization because of the relatively large flux contribution from stars in the host galaxy , assuming that there is no large systematic difference in host galaxy luminosity between types , or from other unpolarized sources such as the featureless continuum ( fc2 ) that is argued to be present in the spectra of some seyfert  2 nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in comparison , a similar host for a typical type  1.82 2mass qso will dilute @xmath78 by about a factor of 2 .    if the 2mass type  2 qsos are high - luminosity analogs to seyfert  2 nuclei , it is not surprising that high broad - band optical ( @xmath24 ) polarization is not observed in these objects .",

    "this category is dominated ( 10 of 14 objects ) by qsos that show no evidence for h@xmath73 emission in their confirmation spectra , though broad h@xmath72 is observed @xcite .",
    "the objects have a median @xmath16 similar to types  1 and 1.5 qsos in the 2mass sample , but their @xmath59 color indices are more typically like the much redder type  1.82 objects .",
    "the red colors and large balmer decrements suggest that we are not seeing much agn light at optical wavelengths and , as with the type  1.82 objects , the host galaxy dilutes the polarized flux .",
    "the low optical polarization of the highly reddened type  1.x qsos could also be the result of dust obscuring the scattering regions .",
    "the optical broad - band polarization results are consistent with the interpretation that the 2mass sample includes a fraction of low-@xmath9 , radio - quiet qsos that are obscured along our line of sight @xcite . in ",
    "3 the 2mass qsos were compared with the predominantly radio - quiet pg qsos in the same redshift range .",
    "this comparison is motivated not only by the similar numbers of objects and the high s / n polarimetry that is available , but also because the two samples have similar luminosity distributions at @xmath0 .",
    "however , it can be seen in figure  4 that the 2mass sample lacks objects as bright at @xmath0 as the most luminous pg qsos .",
    "@xcite suggest that this is caused by selection biases in the 2mass agn sample such as the exclusion of known agn , and that the extinction necessary to achieve @xmath80 essentially rules out finding new objects as bright as the most luminous unobscured qsos",
    ". this should not be the case in the mid- to far - ir where emission from dust near the nucleus will dominate the observed flux .",
    "an important test of the equivalence of the 2mass and optically - selected qsos is a comparison of their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from mid - ir to radio wavelengths where orientation effects are mitigated .",
    "nearly half ( 33 of 70 ) of the 2mass qsos are detected at 1.4  ghz by either the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; * ? ? ? * ) or the vla faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( first ) survey @xcite , and about half ( 5 out of 9 ) of the highly polarized qsos are detected .",
    "the detection rate is about the same for the pg qsos with @xmath50 ( 38 of 75 objects ) , even though the 2mass sample by design omits known agn in radio catalogs .",
    "no object has a 1.4  ghz radio power ( p@xmath81 ) above @xmath82  w  hz@xmath12 , while the pg sample boasts 10 objects with @xmath83 ( figure  5 ) .",
    "in addition to having a number of powerful radio sources , the radio - detected pg sample includes 14 objects with low radio luminosity ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "eleven of these objects have @xmath18 .",
    "the low - luminosity objects are missing from the 2mass sample primarily because of its higher average redshift .",
    "thus , although selection biases strongly affect the 2mass sample , the 2mass qsos are roughly consistent in radio luminosity with the radio - quiet pg qsos .",
    "there is no evidence for any relationship between radio luminosity and high optical polarization among the 2mass objects .    despite the similarity in the overall 1.4  ghz detection statistics for the 2mass and pg qso samples , the type  1 2mass objects are under - represented in the radio surveys .",
    "only three of 22 type  1 qsos are detected by first or nvss , whereas @xmath3360% of objects in the other 2mass spectral categories are detected at 1.4  ghz ( table  5 ) .",
    "the reason behind the lack of radio sources associated with type  1 objects in the near - ir selected sample compared to the optically selected pg qsos is not readily apparent , but this discrepancy hints at possible intrinsic differences in the central engine and/or agn environment between the two samples .",
    "comparison between the 2mass and pg qso samples in the mid infrared is difficult because of the small number of objects detected by _",
    "iras_. only 15 of the 70 2mass qsos are detected at 60@xmath70 m in the _ iras _ faint source catalog ( fsc ) .",
    "nineteen pg qsos with @xmath50 were detected and the slightly higher success rate is due to the pg sample containing more objects with @xmath18 that are more likely to be bright enough to be seen by _",
    "iras_. figure  6 shows that the",
    "_ iras_-detected 2mass qsos are generally more luminous at 60@xmath70 m for a given near - ir luminosity than the pg qsos , but this is at least partially a selection bias caused by the higher redshift of the 2mass sample .",
    "two highly polarized 2mass qsos were detected by _",
    "iras _ and neither of these objects show an excess of 60@xmath70 m emission above that expected from a pg qso .    as with the radio surveys , the type  1 2mass qsos are rare in the sample detected at 60@xmath70 m , with only 2m171442 being represented . the remainder of the 60@xmath70 m detections summarized in table  5 are distributed among types  1.5 ( 6 of 19 objects ) , 1.x ( 6 of 10 objects ) , 1.8 ( 2m022150 ) , and 1.b ( 2m130700 ) .",
    "the large representation of type  1.x qsos in figure  6 is striking .",
    "these objects tend to be the most luminous qsos at 60@xmath70 m for a given @xmath16",
    ". it may be that these systems contain more dust than other types of qsos , a difference that could account for the observed infrared emission , redder optical and near - ir colors , and large balmer decrements .",
    "one possibility is that the excess dust has been added via a merger with another galaxy .",
    "this would also help to explain the low polarizations observed for the type  1.x objects since a large amount of dust in the system could obscure the scattering regions .",
    "the presence of two stellar systems would also help to dilute any polarized flux from the agn .",
    "future high - resolution optical and near - ir imaging of the 2mass sample can explore the possible role that galaxy mergers play in qsos .    the high sensitivity of the _ space infrared telescope facility _",
    "( _ sirtf _ ) is well suited to examine the mid - ir seds of agn samples .",
    "sirtf _ observations may resolve the issue of whether near - ir selected , red qsos are similar to optically - selected qsos in their mid- and far - ir properties as expected if orientation to our line of sight is indeed the major discriminant between agn types at shorter wavelengths , or are systematically more luminous as suggested by the few _ iras _ detections .",
    "broad - band optical polarization surveys exist for the balqsos and _ iras _ higs that help place the new 2mass sample in context with current ideas concerning agn . in figure  7",
    "we plot the cumulative distributions of optical polarization for these two samples along with those of the 2mass and pg qsos .",
    "results of kolomagorov - shmirnov ( ks ) tests on the distributions are given in table  6 , where it can be seen that the observed differences between the pg qsos and the other three samples are far larger than would be expected if the samples were drawn from the same parent population .",
    "@xcite have shown that the polarization distributions for the pg qsos and balqsos can be made similar if @xmath38 for the pg sample is multiplied by @xmath332.4 .",
    "that is , the higher polarization observed in balqsos can be explained if the direct , unpolarized nuclear light from these objects is attenuated in our line of sight by @xmath331  mag above that experienced by a typical pg qso .",
    "this interpretation is in keeping with evidence that low - ionization balqsos are reddened by dust @xcite and with detailed spectropolarimetry that implies a covering factor @xmath85 for the absorbing gas and material partially obscuring the nucleus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the implications of the broad - band polarimetry are not changed by the addition of the observations of @xcite and @xcite that increases the balqso sample to 85 objects .",
    "the cumulative distributions of the 2mass qsos and balqsos ( figure  7 ) follow each other closely for low polarization levels ( @xmath86% ) . @xcite",
    "have shown that the larger statistical bias associated with the higher average observational uncertainty of the fainter balqsos does not explain the generally higher levels of polarization observed for balqsos relative to the pg sample for @xmath872% . because the mean observational uncertainties of the 2mass qso and balqso polarization measurements are similar , the divergence of the 2mass and pg qso distributions at low polarization levels also can not be an artifact of statistical bias in the measurements .",
    "therefore , the 2mass qso sample is not distinguished from the pg qso sample simply by the addition of a small fraction ( @xmath331015% ) of highly polarized objects . like the balqsos , the 2mass qso sample _ as a whole _ exhibits higher polarization than the pg qsos .",
    "the congruence of the 2mass qso and balqso distributions at low polarization levels suggests a possible relationship between these two samples .",
    "in fact , despite a divergence at high polarization , a ks test yields a reasonable probability that the samples could be drawn from the same parent population ( p@xmath88 ) .",
    "of the four known high - redshift ( @xmath89 ) agn found by 2mass , one shows broad mg  ii absorption @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the 2mass qso sample is made up in part of objects that are low - redshift analogs to the high-@xmath9 balqsos , but there are some effects that must be taken into account to properly compare the polarization properties of the two samples .    first , the balqsos tend to be at a much higher redshift ( @xmath90 ) than the 2mass qsos ( @xmath51 ) . as a result , optical polarimetry of most balqsos measures @xmath38 in the rest - frame ultraviolet . any general wavelength dependence in the continuum polarization between the optical and near - uv will result in a systematic difference between the samples .",
    "possibly more important is the effect of host galaxy starlight . unlike the 2mass objects , polarization measurements of balqsos are unlikely to be affected by the host galaxy because of the overwhelming brightness of the nucleus and the fact that the observations are made blueward of the ca  h and k break where the flux from galaxies is diminished .    correcting the polarimetry of 2mass qsos for host galaxy starlight will result in a greater differentiation between the polarization distributions of the 2mass and balqso samples .",
    "we have attempted to measure the effect on @xmath38 of the host galaxy in several 2mass qsos using the imaging polarimetry data .",
    "various digital apertures were tried to explore the dependence of @xmath38 on aperture size . however , with an image scale of @xmath3305 pixel@xmath12 , even the smallest practical apertures admit a large fraction of the total stellar flux , and in no case is the expected trend of decreasing @xmath38 with increasing aperture size unambiguously observed .    a final difference to be noted between the polarization properties of 2mass qsos and balqsos",
    "is presented by spectropolarimetry .",
    "@xcite summarize the general spectropolarimetric properties found for balqsos from various studies which imply that scattering produces the observed polarization ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in most cases ,",
    "the broad emission lines are not as highly polarized as the continuum , and in several instances there is no evidence for broad emission lines in the polarized flux spectrum at all .",
    "spectropolarimetry of highly polarized 2mass qsos , on the other hand , shows that the broad balmer lines tend to be polarized to about the same level as the continuum @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the view that the continuum source is more heavily obscured than the blr in balqsos , but the two are attenuated by about the same amount in the 2mass objects .",
    "future ultraviolet spectroscopy will provide a direct test of the possible relationships between the 2mass qsos and balqsos .",
    "determining the fraction of near - ir selected qsos that show broad absorption lines and comparing the uv properties of 2mass qsos with other samples will likely yield important information about the structure of luminous , obscured agn and about the role that orientation plays in the selection and identification of these objects .",
    "in a similar vein , soft x - ray observations of 2mass qsos can measure the x - ray absorption in the line of sight and these values can be compared to the absorbing column densities exhibited by other agn samples ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "results from the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory suggest that 2mass qsos exhibit column densities ,",
    "@xmath91  @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "the higs are another important qso sample @xcite that may be closely related to objects found from their near - ir colors . like the 2mass sample , the higs are composed of agn of various optical spectral types and show larger infrared - to - optical flux ratios than are observed for uv / optically selected qsos . @xcite and @xcite have found that the _ iras _ higs as a class are optically highly polarized ( see figure  7 ) .",
    "spectropolarimetry of the most luminous higs with type 2-like spectra has revealed that these objects are powered by qsos obscured in our line of sight @xcite .",
    "the small _ iras _ sample occupies a larger region of redshift space ( @xmath932.3 ) than do the 2mass qsos ( @xmath50 ) , and it is the high - redshift ( most luminous ) higs that tend to be the most highly polarized .",
    "this resembles the trend between @xmath38 and near - ir luminosity found for the 2mass qsos (  3.3 ) .",
    "another parallel between the two samples is that objects with the highest infrared - to - optical flux ratios ( as measured by @xmath94 for the 2mass sample and @xmath95 for the higs ) tend to be the most highly polarized .",
    "these trends in the polarization properties suggest that the higs may represent the high - luminosity tail of the dust - obscured qso population .",
    "the type 2 _ iras _ higs are among the most luminous objects known and are highly polarized ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas the lower luminosity type 2 2mass qsos do not show high optical broad - band polarization .",
    "we ascribe this difference to the dominance of the scattered light over host galaxy starlight in the higs , and to the fact that the polarimetry of the 2mass qsos does not measure the polarization in the rest - frame uv .",
    "the broad - band optical polarization of qsos selected by their near - ir colors are consistent with the view that many of these objects are obscured to some degree by dust . over 10% of a sample of 70",
    "`` red '' qsos discovered by 2mass @xcite shows high polarization ( @xmath3% ) , and values range up to @xmath3311% .",
    "these high levels of polarization are not present among objects in standard uv - excess catalogs of qsos except for ovvs and a small number of balqsos .",
    "the polarization of 2mass qsos is correlated with near - ir luminosity and color , and with near - ir  to  optical flux ratio in the sense that more luminous and redder objects tend to show high polarization .",
    "these trends suggest that the polarization arises from the scattering of nuclear light by material located close to a partially obscured agn .",
    "spectropolarimetry of two highly polarized 2mass qsos confirms that scattering is the dominant polarizing mechanism in these objects with the scattering material located close to , or within , the nlr @xcite . determining the nature of the scattering material ( either dust and/or electrons )",
    ", however , likely awaits careful modeling of high - quality spectropolarimetry at uv , optical , and infrared wavelengths ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the near - ir color selection of the 2mass agn survey is unbiased with regard to optical spectral type , and we find that high polarization is found among nearly all types , especially those classified as type  1.51.9 by @xcite .",
    "like optically selected qsos , few of the broad emission line - dominated ( type  1 ) qsos have @xmath3% .",
    "this is presumably because the obscuration of direct agn light is sufficiently low that the relative contribution of any scattered component is small .",
    "high polarization is not observed in type  2 qsos in this sample , although their colors and @xmath0 luminosities are consistent with these objects being among the most heavily obscured in the sample . dilution of scattered , polarized light by starlight from the host galaxy is suggested as the reason for low observed optical polarization in this case .",
    "this assertion is consistent with the fact that most seyfert  2 galaxies that are highly polarized in the uv show @xmath6% for @xmath96   .",
    "ultraviolet polarimetry and high quality imaging provide obvious tests of the effect of host galaxy starlight on the polarization of 2mass qsos .",
    "the distribution of optical polarization for the 2mass qsos further substantiates the trend that higher polarization is seen in qso samples that have higher apparent ir  to  optical luminosity ratios ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the 2mass objects are not as extreme in @xmath97 as the _ iras _ higs , and neither is their general level of polarization . on the other hand , the 2mass sample is much more highly polarized than the pg qsos , which generally have the lowest @xmath97 .",
    "this is presumably because our view of the nuclear region is not hindered by dust in uv - excess agn .",
    "although the 2mass and balqso distributions in @xmath38 are fairly similar , corrections for starlight and for differing observing bandpasses are likely to better differentiate these two samples and thereby increase the significance of the correlation between @xmath38 and @xmath97 .",
    "this correlation implies that orientation effects and/or the dust covering factor are largely responsible for differences in the optical and ir properties between various samples of high - luminosity agn .",
    "alternatively , the near - ir  selected qsos may represent a different evolutionary stage than the optically selected , uv - excess qsos .",
    "further orientation - independent investigations of these samples , such as imaging of host galaxies and environments , extended radio emission , and ir observations using _ sirtf _ will be necessary to distinguish between evolutionary and orientation effects .",
    "finally , the polarization properties of the 2mass qsos suggests that this new near - ir  selected sample may include a large proportion of low - redshift balqsos .",
    "ultraviolet observations can directly test this possibility , and together with x - ray measurements , investigate the nature of the obscuring material .",

    "<S> more than 10% of a sample of 70 qsos discovered in the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) with @xmath1 and @xmath2 show high broad - band linear polarization ( @xmath3% ) , and values range to a maximum of @xmath4% . </S>",
    "<S> high polarization tends to be associated with the most luminous objects at @xmath0 , and with qsos having the highest near - ir  to  optical flux ratios . </S>",

    "<S> high polarization is seen in two of 22 broad emission - line ( type  1 ) objects , but @xmath5 of the qsos of intermediate spectral type ( type  1.51.9 ) are highly polarized . none of the nine qsos classified as type  2 exhibit @xmath3% . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that the unavoidable inclusion of unpolarized starlight from the host galaxy within the observation aperture results in reduced polarization for the narrow emission - line objects .    </S>",
    "<S> the high polarization of 2mass - discovered qsos supports the conclusion inferred from their near - ir and optical colors , that the nuclei of many of these objects are obscured to some degree by dust . </S>",
    "<S> correlations between optical polarization and near - ir luminosity and color imply that the dominant polarizing mechanism in the sample is scattering of agn light into our line of sight by material located in relatively unobscured regions near the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the broad - band polarization properties of the 2mass qso sample are compared to those of other , predominantly radio - quiet , qsos and are found to be consistent with the idea that the orientation of agn to the line of sight plays a major role in determining their observed properties . </S>"
