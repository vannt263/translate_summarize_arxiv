    "the double - exchange model , involving the interaction @xmath6 between the magnetic impurity spin @xmath7 and the electron spin @xmath8 , has been the starting point in nearly all theoretical studies , and we first review the emerging physical picture and the different approaches employed .",
    "long range ferromagnetic interaction between the @xmath9 mn@xmath10 ions is mediated , in the mean - field ( zener model ) picture,@xcite by a uniform itinerant - carrier spin polarization , which is caused , in turn , by an effective uniform magnetic field , resulting from site - averaging ( virtual crystal approximation ) of the local impurity fields . in the weak - field limit ( @xmath11 ) , the carrier spin polarization is proportional to the pauli susceptibility @xmath12 , and the transition temperature ( @xmath13 ) is therefore proportional to the mn concentration @xmath14 , @xmath15 , the carrier effective mass @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the hole concentration . in dms , @xmath18 is a only a small fraction ( @xmath19 ) of @xmath14 due to large compensation by as antisite defects .",
    "therefore , the fermi energy @xmath20 itself is quite small compared to the bandwidth @xmath21 , and hence the weak - field limit is valid only for @xmath22 .",
    "valence band spin splitting comparable in size to the fermi energy has been confirmed experimentally.@xcite    dynamical correlations in the ordered state have been studied within a path - integral formulation in which the itinerant carriers are integrated out and the effective action for the impurity spins is expanded up to quadratic order ( non - interacting spin - wave approximation).@xcite in contrast to the mf results , the spin stiffness ( and hence @xmath2 ) is independent of @xmath0 and inversely proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "other approaches incorporating dynamics include the dynamical mean field theory,@xcite in which the local charge and spin fluctuations are included but long - range spin - wave excitations are neglected , and a rpa - level spin - fluctuation approach in which mn disorder is treated within the coherent potential approximation ( cpa).@xcite    while the positional disorder of mn ions is not taken into account in the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) , several recent works highlight the importance of disorder , both positional and electronic .",
    "stability of the collinear ferromagnetic state has been investigated with randomly distributed mn ions , and noncollinear ordering is suggested to be common to these semiconductor systems.@xcite competing ( af ) interactions leading to frustration has already been evidenced by spin - glass behavior in ii - vi dms.@xcite the presence of large compensation due to as antisite defects implies substantial electronic disorder as well , and the sensitivity of @xmath24 , magnetization @xmath25 , transport and spin - wave spectrum to disorder has been investigated.@xcite monte carlo simulations have also been used to study disorder effects on magnetic ordering,@xcite and dynamical and transport properties;@xcite the background fermions determine the spin interactions and hence the nature of the spin ordering , which in turn affects the fermionic states .",
    "ab - initio methods@xcite have also been recently employed .",
    "an alternative mechanism for the ferromagnetic coupling between impurity spins involves the hole - mediated rkky interaction.@xcite the rkky theory has been extended for various dimensionality structures , including effect of potential scattering through carrier mean - free path , indicating enhancement of ferromagnetic interaction by disorder in low dimensions.@xcite exchange and correlation has been shown to slightly enhance @xmath24 within the rkky theory.@xcite spin - wave dispersion in the rkky picture has been compared with the result of spin - wave theory in which a uniform impurity - induced polarization has been assumed ( vca ) , resulting in a zeeman splitting @xmath26 in the carrier bands.@xcite it was shown that the rkky - level dispersion is incorrect except when @xmath27 .",
    "the traditional rkky approach is based on linear response in the weak - field limit ( @xmath28 ) , which is not quite valid for the dms . in this paper , we present a generalized rkky approach which takes into account the spatial variation of the impurity - induced carrier spin polarization beyond linear response theory [ section ii ] . in the generalized rkky picture , the local magnetic field @xmath29 of a magnetic impurity at site @xmath30",

    "we find several interesting competing processes which limit the growth of spin couplings .",
    "as the rkky response involves a particle - hole process , it vanishes for a filled ( valence ) band and grows with increasing hole concentration @xmath18 . while the spin coupling is therefore expected to strengthen with @xmath18 , a competing process involving the length scale sets in , which limits the growth of the spin coupling and therefore of the ferromagnetic transition temperature @xmath2 .",

    "we find a similar optimization in the spin coupling as a function of the impurity field strength @xmath36 . by going beyond linear response theory , and examining the generalized rkky response for a fixed hole concentration , we find that the rkky oscillation becomes more rapid with increasing polarizing field .",
    "therefore , for a fixed separation between two impurity spins , the spin coupling initially increases like @xmath15 as expected , but then crosses over and eventually changes sign , resulting in frustration [ section iii ] .",

    "when the spin - wave energy is much smaller than the mean - field strength @xmath26 , spin dynamics is dominant at low temperatures and charge fluctuations can be ignored for @xmath209 .",
    "incorporating the low - energy spin fluctuations about the mf state yields quantitatively correct temperature dependence of ( sublattice ) magnetization and reliable @xmath24 within the renormalized spin - wave - theory ( swt).@xcite whereas @xmath24 pertains to global ordering , with the spin coupling energy providing the relevant energy scale for spin fluctuations , the mft deals with local ordering , and greatly over - estimates the transition temperature ( @xmath210 ) , which really represents the moment - melting temperature .    specifically with regard to the dms , there is a subtle issue concerning the energy scale relevant for global ordering .",
    "whereas for a generic ferromagnet , energy scales corresponding to the local mean field and spin coupling are identical , for the dms , three distinct energies can be identified  the two local mean fields seen by the carrier spin ( @xmath211 ) and impurity spin ( @xmath212 ) , and the coupling between impurity spins ( @xmath213 ) . in the weak doping limit ( @xmath214 )",
    ", the magnetic response function @xmath83 decays slowly on the impurity - separation scale , so that @xmath215 , and the distinction between the two latter energy scales gets blurred .",
    "however , for a realistic fractional doping of @xmath216 , the impurity spin coupling @xmath217 is by far the lowest energy scale , and should therefore control the low - temperature behaviour of the magnetization @xmath218 .",
    "the ferromagnetic transition temperature @xmath2 , determined within the spin - wave - theory from the spin coupling energy for a realistic ( heavy ) hole bandwidth , corresponds closely with the observed @xmath2 values in @xmath139 and @xmath219 . with appropriate hole doping ,",
    "transition temperature much above room temperature appears possible for @xmath178 , which is within experimental limit.@xcite    the mf+sf approach also highlights the role of impurity disorder .",
    "while the low - energy spin - wave modes are significantly softened as compared to the ordered case , the high - energy spin - wave modes are clearly stiffened , indicating that a single spin - wave energy scale is not sufficient to describe the low - temperature spin dynamics in the dms .",
    "in fact , a distribution in spin couplings , with weak and strong bonds , has been suggested to be responsible for anomalous temperature dependence of magnetization , susceptibility , specific heat etc.@xcite using a simple model involving two spin - excitation energy scales corresponding to weakly and strongly coupled spins , the temperature dependence of magnetization is found to be in good agreement with the squid magnetization data for ga@xmath3mn@xmath4as.@xcite",
