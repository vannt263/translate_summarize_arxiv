    "after the discovery of the heavy top quark at the tevatron in 1995 there has been much interest in the use of the proposed high energy linear @xmath1 collider as a copious source of top quark pairs . when the proposed linear collider ilc comes into operation it is necessary to have available detailed radiative corrections to the production and the decay of top quark pairs .",
    "concerning production there are a number of unpolarized and single spin polarized structure functions that describe the @xmath1 production process of massive top quark pairs . in the unpolarized case one",
    "has the three structure functions @xmath6 ( unpolarized transverse ) , @xmath7 ( longitudinal ) , and @xmath8 ( forward - backward ) which determine the polar angle orientation of the top pair relative to the beam axis .",
    "partial results on the full @xmath0 radiative corrections to the unpolarized structure functions @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 had been written down in refs .",
    "@xcite starting with the early work on the @xmath9 qed radiative corrections to the vector current @xmath10 vertex function  @xcite .",
    "complete results on the @xmath0 unpolarized structure functions have been first given in refs .",
    "all of the unpolarized @xmath0 structure functions were recalculated in the course of computing the top quark s @xmath0 polarization asymmetries where the unpolarized structure functions were needed to normalize the polarization asymmetries @xcite .",
    "the numerators of the polarization asymmetries are expressed in terms of polarized structure functions . in the case of the longitudinal polarization of the top one",
    "has the three structure functions @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 for which the full @xmath0 radiative corrections were given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the case of a top quark polarized transverse or normal to the event plane ,",
    "one has two structure functions in each case which are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "these were calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when doing the full @xmath0 radiative corrections one integrates over the full ( hard and soft ) gluon phase space . for some applications it is also interesting to consider radiative corrections where one integrates over gluon phase space up to a given gluon energy cut @xmath18 . , @xmath19 and @xmath18 . ]",
    "such radiative corrections may be dictated by experimental considerations when soft gluons accompanying the top quark pair can not be resolved by the detector .",
    "alternatively one could attempt to measure the cross section for top  antitop  gluon production with a given gluon energy cut @xmath18 and compare the energy cut dependence of the cross section with the predictions of qcd .",
    "finally , one could define a hard gluon region by introducing a lower gluon energy cut and compare experiment with qcd in the hard gluon region .",
    "in this paper we provide analytical results for the @xmath0 radiative corrections to the three unpolarized structure functions @xmath6 ,",
    "@xmath7 , and @xmath8 as well as for the seven polarized structure functions @xmath20 ,",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 for polarized top quarks where we integrate over the gluon energy phase space up to a given energy cut @xmath18 .",
    "we mention that radiative corrections with a gluon energy cut have been treated before in the unpolarized case  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that we are not using the soft - gluon approximation ( sga ) in the present calculation but integrate over the full @xmath0 matrix element tree graph structure .",
    "however , we will compare our results with the soft - gluon approximation .",
    "the soft - gluon approximation consists of the factorization of the tree graph contribution into the born term contribution and a universal soft - gluon piece which can be easily integrated .",
    "an @xmath0 calculation of some of the structure functions appearing in polarized top pair production using variants of the soft - gluon approximation has been done before in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the further aims of the present investigation is to find out to what extent one can pin down a new non - sm ( standard model ) coupling structure in top quark pair production in the presence of @xmath0 radiative corrections with an exact treatment of gluon emission rather than soft - gluon emission . in the latter approximation",
    "the tree graph contribution is born term like and thus polarization - type observables would not be affected by the radiative tree graph corrections but only by the non - born term structure of the one - loop contributions .",
    "deviations from sm predictions for the polarization - type observables could result from new non - sm coupling structure or from an exact treatment of radiative corrections . as an example we will introduce an anomalous @xmath25-odd axial current and compare the results of our exact next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation with the contributions of the anomalous axial current for some relevant observables and structure functions .",
    "in order to acquaint the reader with our notation , we use this section to outline the main structure of the cross section calculation and to introduce the various unpolarized and polarized structure functions that come into play . to start with , we define a polarized hadron tensor for the three - body process @xmath26 according to @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the four - momenta of the quark , antiquark and gluon , respectively , and @xmath31 is the four - momentum of the intermediate gauge boson .",
    "the spin vector of the quark is denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "a similar definition holds for the born case @xmath33 .",
    "the hadron tensor defined in eq .",
    "( [ hadten ] ) depends on the vector ( @xmath34 : @xmath35 ) and axial - vector ( @xmath36 : @xmath37 ) composition of the product of currents @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the four independent hadron tensor components @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) defined according to @xmath42 for notational convenience we have omitted all arguments in the hadron tensor components in eqs .",
    "( [ h^i ] ) . in the following",
    "we will use explicit arguments only when they are needed .",
    "for example , we include the spin vector argument when we define unpolarized and polarized structure functions @xmath40 and @xmath43 ( @xmath41 , @xmath44 ) according to @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the spin vector corresponding to longitudinal ( @xmath47 ) , transverse ( @xmath48 ) and normal ( @xmath49 ) polarization of the top quark .",
    "our choices of the three orthonormal spin directions @xmath50 are given by @xmath51 ( cf .",
    "[ tsys ] ) .    for the hadron tensor components we introduce the compact notation @xmath52 where the round brackets indicate that , in the unpolarized case , the index @xmath53 and the round bracket is omitted .",
    "we use this compact notation to display the general features common to the unpolarized and polarized parts .    for the process @xmath54",
    ", the cross section can be written in modular form consisting of the hadron tensor , the lepton tensor and the model dependent coupling coefficients @xmath55 . the standard model ( sm )",
    "values of the coupling coefficients @xmath55 are listed in appendix  a. the unpolarized and polarized cross sections read @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the phase - space factor . the lepton tensor components @xmath58 ( @xmath41 ) are defined in the same way as in eq .",
    "( [ h^i ] ) .",
    "the process @xmath54 can be described either in the _ beam plane _ spanned by the electron and positron beam and the outgoing quark , or the _ event plane _ spanned by the quark , the antiquark , and the gluon . in the born case where no gluon is emitted ,",
    "both planes coincide by convention .",
    "the polar angle between the quark momentum and the electron momentum is denoted by @xmath59 ( or by @xmath60 ) , and the azimuthal angle between the two planes is denoted by @xmath61 . in order to determine directions , we define different frames with the @xmath62 plane lying in the corresponding plane . for the beam plane",
    "we define a _ lepton frame _ with the @xmath63 axis determined by the momentum direction of the electron , and a _ beam frame _ with the @xmath63 axis determined by the momentum direction of the quark . for the event plane",
    "we define an _ event frame _ with the @xmath63 direction determined again by the momentum direction of the quark .",
    "the transition from one frame to the other is performed by using the two euler angles @xmath59 and @xmath61 .    the natural frame for describing the hadron tensor",
    "is the event frame which makes no reference to the beam plane . on the other hand ,",
    "the lepton tensor is most naturally described in the lepton frame . in this frame the lepton tensor component @xmath64",
    "vanishes identically and @xmath65 vanishes for zero lepton masses ( which we assume ) .",
    "the remaining two components have the simple form @xmath66 the contraction of the lepton and hadron tensor has to be done in one particular frame for which we choose the event frame .",
    "we therefore have to rotate the lepton tensor into the event frame . in doing so",
    "a variety of angular dependences appear .",
    "in fact we can decompose the lepton tensors according to @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 contain an implicit linear dependence on @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the matrices @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath68 , @xmath74 and @xmath69 are called _ projectors _ because when contracting the lepton tensor with the hadron tensor they project out the relevant coefficients of the hadron tensor that give rise to the various angular dependences . the decomposition in eq .",
    "( [ decomp ] ) describes the complete angular dependence of unpolarized and polarized top production in the process @xmath54 .",
    "it gives rise to the decomposition of the differential cross section according to @xmath75 where @xmath76 without beam polarization effects one finds the following pattern . for @xmath77",
    "one has contributions from @xmath78 and for @xmath79 one has contributions from @xmath80 as written out in eq .",
    "( [ decomp ] ) .",
    "more details about the coupling pattern including transverse and longitudinal beam polarization effects can be found in  @xcite . in eqs .",
    "( [ sigmaa ] ) we have divided out the @xmath81 differential which has already been taken into account in the polar distribution ( [ polar ] ) . for the two - particle final states ( born term and loop contribution ) one has the phase - space factor @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the velocity of the outgoing quark .",
    "the transition to the rightmost form in eq .",
    "( [ dps2 ] ) marked by an arrow expresses the fact that the azimuthal integration over @xmath61 is always implied throughout this paper . as we shall see , the transverse and normal spin dependence drop out for the components @xmath84 in @xmath85 but are retained for the components @xmath86 after the azimuthal integration over @xmath61 .",
    "just the opposite happens to the spin independent and longitudinal spin components .",
    "for the two - particle final state one obtains @xmath87 with @xmath78 for @xmath77 and @xmath80 for @xmath79 as above .",
    "next we turn to the @xmath0 tree graph contributions .",
    "the relevant three particle final state phase - space is given by @xmath88 where the transition to the last expression is again due to the azimuthal integration .",
    "we have introduced two phase - space variables @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the @xmath0 tree graph contributions to the various cross sections @xmath91 are written as @xmath92 with @xmath78 for @xmath77 and @xmath80 for @xmath79 , as before .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the tree graph helicity structure functions @xmath93 by defining @xmath94 the born term and the @xmath0 corrections @xmath95 and @xmath96 will be referred to as the _ unpolarized _ and _ polarized structure functions _ to leading ( lo ) and next - to - leading ( nlo ) order , respectively , while the sum of the lo and nlo contributions will be referred to as the @xmath0 results .    in summary ,",
    "one has three unpolarized and seven polarized hadronic helicity structure functions .",
    "it is instructive to list them together including a specification of whether they are fed by the parity conserving ( @xmath97 ) or by the parity violating ( @xmath98 ) part of the product of hadronic currents and to which of the two classes of the so - called @xmath99-even and @xmath99-odd structure functions they belong to .",
    "one has @xmath100 if one neglects contributions proportional to the imaginary part @xmath101 of the breit  wigner line shape of the @xmath102-boson ( see appendix a ) the @xmath99-odd helicity structure functions @xmath103 and @xmath104 are contributed to by the imaginary parts of the one - loop amplitudes leading to nonvanishing triple product correlations of the type @xmath105 , whereas the @xmath99-even structure functions obtain contributions from the born term , the @xmath0 tree graph contributions and the real part of the one - loop contributions .",
    "if one includes the contributions proportional to the imaginary part @xmath101 the structure functions @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are also contributed to by the imaginary parts of the one - loop contributions , and , vice versa , @xmath103 obtains also contributions from the born term , the @xmath0 tree graph contributions and the real part of the one - loop contributions .",
    "all the latter contributions originate from the @xmath109 part of the product of hadron currents and thus belong to the class of helicity structure functions @xmath110 according to the classification of eq .",
    "( [ h^i ] ) . the latter contributions can only be probed through the imaginary part of the breit  wigner resonance shape which is strongly suppressed for @xmath111 production .",
    "in fact , the contributions coming from the imaginary part of the breit  wigner resonance shape are of order @xmath112 and can thus safely be neglected for top quark pair production .",
    "for example , in the threshold region of top quark pair production @xmath113 is approximately @xmath114 and decreases further with a @xmath115 power fall - off behaviour .",
    "we shall nevertheless include all @xmath110 contributions for completeness and for possible applications in @xmath116 production where the @xmath110 contributions can not be neglected in the @xmath102 resonance region .",
    "the projectors @xmath117 will be written in covariant form .",
    "we go to the rest frame of the gauge boson such that @xmath118 .",
    "the @xmath63 axis is defined by the momentum direction of the top quark . for the top quark momentum one has @xmath119 ( @xmath120 for two - body decays ) with @xmath121 .",
    "we construct a four - transverse quark momentum and a four - transverse metric tensor @xmath122 and use @xmath123 and @xmath124 to build up two elements of a coordinate basis , @xmath125 in covariant form the longitudinal spin vector of the top quark reads ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath126 in the gauge boson rest system eq .",
    "( [ covspin ] ) turns into @xmath127 while in the top quark rest system one has @xmath128 .",
    "the longitudinal spin vector @xmath129 can be seen to be a linear combination of the two basis vectors @xmath130 and @xmath131 and does not provide a new direction in our vierbein basis .",
    "the projectors that can be constructed with the help of @xmath130 and @xmath131 are limited to the three projectors @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the totally antisymmetric levi - civit tensor with @xmath134 .",
    "they project out the three unpolarized and three longitudinally polarized helicity structure functions where , according to eq .",
    "( [ spinprojection ] ) , the polarized structure functions @xmath135 ( @xmath84 ) are obtained from @xmath136 .",
    "the transverse and normal polarization vectors of the top quark are defined in the beam frame .",
    "viewed from the event frame they are given by @xmath137 these two vectors therefore allow one to span the beam plane and a plane perpendicular to the beam plane in event frame coordinates . with these new elements it is possible to construct the remaining additional projectors .",
    "they read ( @xmath138 ) @xmath139 for example , according to eq .",
    "( [ spinprojection ] ) , one obtains the structure function @xmath140 by calculating @xmath141 .",
    "note that since @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 the primed projectors are redundant .",
    "this set of four ( eq .  ( [ project2 ] ) ) and six ( eq .  ( [ project1 ] ) )",

    "we mention that there exists a large body of literature of how non - sm interactions in the production ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) ( such as the anomalous coupling eq .  ( [ anocurrent ] ) ) , and/or in the decay affect such spin  momentum correlations ( see e.g.  ref .",

    "gluons can be emitted from the original production process @xmath431 as well as from the follow - up decay process @xmath432 and @xmath433 where we take the @xmath430 s to decay leptonically .",
    "interference effects between the two processes are expected to be quite small since they are suppressed by a factor of @xmath434 . in order to identify the gluons of the original production process ( which are the subject of this paper )",
    "one has to demand that the gluon s four - momentum satisfies @xmath435 .",
    "gluons that satisfy @xmath436 or @xmath437 clearly originate from the follow - up processes and can thus be vetoed .",
    "how effectively gluons not originating from the original production process can be removed from the data sample has to be carefully studied in detailed monte carlo simulation runs .    with the appropriate modifications our results",
    "can also be applied to the @xmath116 case .",
    "while the @xmath101 contributions resulting from the imaginary part of the breit  wigner line shape are negligibly small in the @xmath111 case ( since @xmath111 threshold is far away from the @xmath102 pole ) the @xmath101 contribution is more pronounced in the @xmath116 case in particular in the vicinity of the @xmath102 pole .",
    "however , close to the @xmath102 pole the transverse and normal polarization of the bottom quark are severely suppressed due to the overall helicity suppression factor @xmath438 . in this sense",
    "the phenomenology of the top quark spin above @xmath111 threshold is richer than that of the bottom quark in the high energy realm .",
