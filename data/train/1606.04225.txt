    "_ physarum polycephalum _ is an amoeboid slime mold that exhibits remarkable information processing capabilities . in controlled experiments ,",
    "the slime mold s abilities have been leveraged to determine the shortest path between two locations in a network @xcite and , more generally , to adaptively form efficient transport networks @xcite .",
    "the question remains , however , of detailing and analyzing the underlying mechanisms and goals of such an optimization process , which have been only partially explored @xcite .    _",
    "p.  polycephalum _ , like other myxomycetes , has a somewhat complicated life cycle consisting of several stages @xcite . during its mature plasmodium stage it forms a single , giant multinucleate acellular structure",
    "this acellular structure takes the form of a tubular vein network , through which protoplasm is periodically transported , driven by the gradient of hydrostatic pressure .    in a remarkable experiment by @xcite ,",
    "the plasmodium has been placed on a preexisting artificial network structure and two food sources ( oat flakes ) have been laid over two nodes @xmath0 , @xmath1 of the network . _",
    "p.  polycephalum _ reacted by adapting its shape dynamically , by controlling the width of the tubular structures forming its veins , based on feedback from the protoplasmic flow .",
    "gradually , several branches of the vein network collapsed , eventually leaving the mass of the slime mold only along the shortest path between the two food sources @xmath0 and @xmath1 , thus exhibiting evidence of fluid transport optimization .",
    "@xcite were the first to propose a mathematical model for the transport optimization dynamics of _",
    "p.  polycephalum_. for a critical value of the model parameters , the model s dynamics indeed provably converge to the shortest path between the two food - source terminals of the underlying network .",
    "such a convergence to the shortest path has been analytically proven by @xcite for a ring - shaped network , by @xcite for a wheatstone bridge - shaped network , and finally by @xcite for arbitrary complex networks .",
    "however , the global convergence of the dynamics to the shortest path fails for other values of the model s power - law exponent , called @xmath2 by @xcite , as well as for nonzero values of the parameter @xmath3 controlling saturation of the tubular dynamics . in this article",
    "we propose a revised model that , while enlarging the class of admissible response functions , has the property of converging to the shortest path in the network from any initial condition , independently of the specific details of the response dynamics or of the values of its parameters .",
    "we prove this analytically for a parallel - edge network , and test our claim by simulation on more complex topologies .",
    "fluid transport in _",
    "p.  polycephalum _ is based on the positive feedback mechanism between the width of the veins and the fluid flow . on a longer time scale , it is driven by network peristalsis , which reverses the flow velocities periodically @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the time between reversals is much larger than the time required for the veins to adapt their widths under a steady flow . in this work",
    "we focus on the vein adaptation dynamics , without attempting to model the peristaltic oscillations .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for one possible model of the rhythmic protoplasmic movement .",
    "other details on the physical underpinnings of physarum s tubular dynamics are discussed by @xcite .",
    "finally , the slime mold network dynamics have also been considered from a combinatorial optimization perspective in the discrete algorithms literature @xcite .",

    "a stability analysis of the new model s equilibria is carried out in section [ sec : parallel ] for networks consisting of parallel edges ; it is proved that the unique stable fixed point corresponds to the shortest path in the graph , independently of the power - law exponent and of the saturation parameter , or , indeed , of the particular shape of the tubular response functions . moreover ,",
    "any nontrivial trajectory approaches such a fixed point . in section [ sec : simul ] we report on simulations for more complex network topologies ; these suggest that the globally optimal behavior of the dynamics may hold in arbitrary topologies , again independently of the particular shape of the tubular response functions .",

    "the two distinguished nodes @xmath0 , @xmath1 are two junctions corresponding to the location of the food sources .    as food is absorbed by the organism , and protoplasmic flow is distributed through the network , the widths of the tubular channels adapt to the flow . in our discussion",

    "for an edge @xmath10 , the value @xmath11 is called the _ capacity _ of @xmath12 .",
    "the transport optimization process described in the introduction has previously been modeled @xcite as a system of coupled , nonlinear ordinary differential equations , @xmath13    equation is called the _ adaptation equation_. the function @xmath14 models the response dynamics of the tubular channels to the fluid flow @xmath15 along the edge .",
    "proposed forms include @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are parameters of the model .",

    "node @xmath0 is the _ source _ of the flow , node @xmath1 the _ sink_. it is very important to remark that while the flow has been somewhat arbitrarily directed from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , the opposite choice yields exactly the same dynamics , because of the absolute value in ; the only effect would be to replace @xmath24 with @xmath33 .",
    "in other words , a flow reversal has no effect on the veins dynamics .    the value @xmath34 is called the _ resistance _ of edge @xmath12 , while @xmath35 is the _ divergence _ of the flow @xmath24 at @xmath36 .",

    "the revised model that we propose resembles closely that discussed in the previous section , following in particular equations . however , since in this work we conjecture that pressure gradients , rather than sheer flow amounts , control the response of the tubular channels , we take the controlling variables to be the ratios @xmath60 ( instead of the edge flows @xmath61 ) .",

    "<S> optimization of fluid transport in the slime mold _ physarum _ _ polycephalum _ has been the subject of several modeling efforts in recent literature . </S>",
    "<S> existing models assume that the tube adaptation mechanism in _ p. polycephalum _ </S>",
    "<S> s tubular network is controlled by the sheer amount of fluid flow through the tubes . </S>",
    "<S> we put forward the hypothesis that the controlling variable may instead be the flow s pressure gradient along the tube . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out the stability analysis of such a revised mathematical model for a parallel - edge network , proving that the revised model supports the global flow - optimizing behavior of the slime mold for a substantially wider class of response functions compared to previous models . simulations also suggest that the same conclusion may be valid for arbitrary network topologies . </S>"
