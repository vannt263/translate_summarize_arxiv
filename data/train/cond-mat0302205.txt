    "in a recent study @xcite we proposed a frustrated spring - network model to simulate the surface structures of crosslinked polymer gels into which voids are introduced through templating by surfactant micelles . experimentally , templated polyacrylamide gels are created by mixing acrylamide with a crosslinker in the presence of a surfactant @xcite .",
    "the resultant gels have a wide range of pore sizes , making them ideal materials for macromolecular separation @xcite .",
    "the crosslinking process introduces inhomogeneities in the spatial density of the gel that affect its surface configuration .",
    "our results show that the surfaces generated by the spring - network model have a nontrivial , multiaffine scaling behavior at small length scales , with a crossover to scale - independent behavior on large scales .    at small length scales we found that the @xmath0th order increment correlation function has a power - law behavior , with @xmath0-dependent exponents that change with the vacancy concentration .",
    "however , experimental surfaces of surfactant - templated hydrogels studied by atomic force microscopy ( afm ) @xcite show @xmath0-independent self - affine scaling at length scales below the crossover length . in ref .",
    "@xcite we discussed the possibility that the multiaffine behavior was due to a finite density of vertical discontinuities due to overhangs in the simulated surfaces .",
    "later work showed analytically and numerically that when vertical discontinuities are introduced into a self - affine surface , it becomes multiaffine @xcite . here",
    "we extend this study to hydrogel surfaces , and we show that smoothing the simulated surfaces by convoluting them with a gaussian changes the scaling behavior from multiaffine to self - affine , in agreement with the experimental afm results .",
    "the smoothing process mimics the effect of the measurement process of an afm tip interacting with the soft substrate .",
    "the model , described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , consists of a two - dimensional triangular network of nodes interconnected by massless harmonic springs .",
    "the nodes represent the crosslinkers , and the springs correspond to the polymer chains .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction , while the top nodes are free to move in two dimensions .",
    "the bottom nodes are fixed , corresponding to bonding to a rigid substrate .",
    "we assume that each spring corresponds to a collapsed polymer chain with equilibrium end - to - end length @xmath1 , which is randomly chosen with probability density @xmath2 thus , @xmath1 is proportional to the square root of an exponentially distributed number of monomers between crosslinkers @xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath3 is proportional to the inverse of the average number of monomers between crosslinkers .",
    "consistent with the picture of a random - coil collapsed polymer chain , we require that the elastic constant of each spring , @xmath4 , be proportional to its equilibrium length , @xmath5 in dimensionless units @xcite .    for each statistical realization of the system , the equilibrium spring lengths are chosen independently according to eq .",
    "( 1 ) . in the initial network configuration",
    ", all springs are placed on the bonds of a regular triangular lattice of unit lattice constant , such that all springs are stretched or compressed to unit length , @xmath6 .",
    "this initial configuration is highly stressed .",
    "however , by choosing the value of @xmath3 such that the average force exerted by each spring is zero , we ensure that the initial configuration is not _ globally _ stressed . from the initial configuration , the system is relaxed to one of its many local energy minima by a limited - memory broyden - fletcher - goldfarb - shanno ( l - bfgs ) quasi - newton minimization algorithm @xcite , and by repeating the calculations for several different realizations of the equilibrium spring lengths we verified that the statistical properties of the different relaxed configurations are essentially the same .",
    "spring networks of @xmath7 nodes were generated , and voids were introduced by randomly removing nodes and the springs connected to them .",
    "the hoshen - kopelman algorithm @xcite was applied to eliminate clusters that were not connected to the fixed substrate , thus mimicking the removal of non - bonded material which is washed away during the experimental preparation .",
    "the one - dimensional surfaces are defined as the set of surface heights , @xmath8 , at equally spaced discrete horizontal points , @xmath9 .",
    "the surface height at @xmath9 , @xmath8 , is taken as the largest vertical distance , measured from the bottom , of the intersections of the springs with a vertical line at @xmath9 , where each spring is represented by a straight line segment between the connected nodes .",
    "this definition of the surface is described in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the @xmath0th order generalized increment correlation function is defined as @xcite @xmath10 for many surfaces , @xmath11 displays a power - law behavior , such that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the generalized hurst exponent @xcite . for self - affine surfaces ,",
    "the scaling behavior is independent of @xmath0 , @xmath14 , but for multiaffine surfaces , there is an infinite hierarchy of scaling exponents , such that @xmath13 depends continuously on @xmath0 , at least for some range of @xmath0 values and length scales @xcite .    very often surfaces present a mixed behavior . for length scales smaller than some crossover ,",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath11 displays a non - trivial scaling behavior , while at length scales larger than this crossover , @xmath16 , @xmath11 is constant , @xmath17 . in our previous work",
    "@xcite it was shown that the simulated gel surfaces are multiaffine , and the scaling exponents , crossover length scales , and saturation values of the increment correlation function are strongly dependent on the void concentration . despite the fact that the experimental surfaces seem to have a similar dependence on the void concentration ,",
    "one major difference between the simulated and experimental surfaces remains : the experimentally measured surfaces are clearly self - affine on short length scales @xcite , while the simulated surfaces are clearly multiaffine @xcite .",
    "recent work @xcite indicates that vertical discontinuities are one important source of multiaffinity , and the surfaces generated by our model certainly have many vertical discontinuities caused by overhangs . even with a weakly interacting afm tip , experimental measurement of a soft surface , such as the polyacrylamide gels studied in  @xcite , should have the effect of smoothing out any vertical discontinuities and overhangs , thus showing a self - affine surface , even if the real surface is multiaffine . to mimic the effect of passing a weakly interacting afm tip over the spring - network surfaces",
    ", we have smoothed the simulated surfaces by convolution with a gaussian of @xmath18 in the dimensionless spatial units of the problem .",
    "this process eliminates the overhangs without changing the overall structural properties of the surfaces .",
    "figure  1 shows a detail of the generated surface and the smoothed surface .",
    "figure  2 shows the @xmath0th root of the generalized increment correlation function @xmath19 for systems with @xmath20 , and @xmath21 vacancies , for both the original and smoothed surfaces .",
    "it is evident that when the discontinuities are eliminated by smoothing , the @xmath22 values become independent of @xmath0 , thus indicating that the surfaces are no longer multiaffine but have become self - affine after smoothing .",
    "the @xmath22 exponents are plotted in fig .  3 versus the void concentration for the original spring - network surfaces .",
    "for the smoothed surfaces , @xmath23 for all void concentrations , as expected for a smooth surface .",

    "the surfaces are averaged over 8 , 8 , and 10 independent realizations of the equilibrium spring lengths for the networks with 0% , 40% , and 49% vacancies , respectively .",
    "the linear regions of the plot indicate power - law scaling , and for the original simulated surfaces , the different power - law exponents ( slopes in the log - log plots ) indicate @xmath0-dependent multiaffine scaling . after smoothing ,",

    "open symbols indicate the original , multiaffine surfaces , while corresponding filled symbols indicate the smoothed , self - affine surfaces . as expected , @xmath23 for all of the smoothed surfaces .",
    "the observed multiaffine scaling of the original surfaces is consistent with the behavior caused by vertical discontinuities as expected from ref .",
    "the data are averaged over 8 independent realizations of the equilibrium spring lengths for 0% to 47% vacancies , 10 realizations for 49% vacancies , and 14 realizations for 49.5% vacancies . ]",
    "in this paper we have shown that surfaces generated by a frustrated spring - network model can reproduce several aspects of the scaling behavior of surfaces of surfactant - templated polyacrylamide gels , as observed in recent afm experiments @xcite .",
    "both real and simulated surfaces show a nontrivial scaling behavior characterized by a power - law form of the increment correlation function at small and intermediate length scales . at",
    "larger length scales the increment correlation function reaches a saturation value .",
    "this large - scale behavior reflects the average network structure , while the small - scale behavior is due to microscopic density fluctuations .",
    "below some crossover length , the experimental surfaces are self - affine while the original simulated surfaces are multiaffine .",
    "we show that after smoothing by convolution with a narrow gaussian , which eliminates vertical discontinuities , the simulated surfaces become self - affine .",
