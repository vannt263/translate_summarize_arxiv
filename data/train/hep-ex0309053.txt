    "measurements of fermion - pair production in  collisions at high energies provide a sensitive test of standard model predictions , and allow limits to be set on many possible new physics processes  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present measurements of cross - sections and angular distributions for hadronic and lepton - pair final states at centre - of - mass energies @xmath87 between 189  gev and 209  gev ; forward - backward asymmetries for the leptonic states are also given .",
    "the data were collected by the opal detector at lep in 1998 , 1999 and 2000 .    in the standard model ,",
    "fermion - pair production proceeds via @xmath88-channel photon and @xmath89 diagrams , except for the @xmath90 final state where @xmath91-channel diagrams dominate .",
    "a general feature of @xmath90 collision data at these energies is radiative return to the @xmath89 .",
    "if one or more initial - state radiation photons are emitted which reduce the effective centre - of - mass energy of the subsequent @xmath90 collision , @xmath92 , to the region of the @xmath89 resonance , the cross - section is greatly enhanced .",
    "a separation can be made between these radiative events and non - radiative events for which @xmath93 .",
    "while the properties of radiative events are similar to those measured in @xmath89 decays at lep1 , modified only by the boost due to recoil against hard initial - state radiation , non - radiative events have different properties , reflecting the increased relative importance of photon - exchange processes above the @xmath89 resonance . at the centre - of - mass energies considered here , the contribution of the photon - exchange diagram to the cross - section is about four times greater than that of the @xmath89-exchange diagram for @xmath94 and @xmath95 final states with @xmath93 .",
    "the analyses presented here are similar to those already presented at lower energies  @xcite .",
    "we use identical techniques to measure @xmath96 and to separate non - radiative events , which have little initial - state radiation , from radiative return to the z peak .",
    "we define non - radiative events as those having @xmath97 , while inclusive measurements correspond to @xmath98 .",
    "we correct our measurements of hadronic ,   and , but not , events to remove the effect of interference between initial- and final - state radiation , as in our previous publications .",
    "the treatment of the four - fermion contribution to the two - fermion final states is similar to that at lower energies .",
    "the precise signal definition is discussed in section  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "while the event selection for hadronic and  final states is essentially unchanged from previous analyses , an improvement in the rejection of cosmic ray events in the  final state has led to a significant reduction in the uncertainty in the residual background . the event selection for  events",
    "has been tightened to reduce the background in this channel , also reducing one of the larger systematic uncertainties . in all channels ,",
    "the higher luminosity and hence higher statistics now available have enabled a more thorough study of systematic effects . combining data from three years",
    "has led to a significant reduction of the experimental systematic uncertainties compared with previous analyses ; for example , the systematic error on the non - radiative hadronic cross - section has been reduced by @xmath9940% . to take advantage of these reduced systematic errors in fits to the standard model and searches for new physics we present updated results for the high statistics data at 189  gev , together with new results at higher energies ; the 189  gev results supersede those presented in  @xcite .    measurements of fermion - pair production up to 189  gev have shown very good agreement with standard model expectations  @xcite . here",
    "we repeat our measurement of the electromagnetic coupling constant ( @xmath87 ) including the higher energy data .",
    "in addition , we combine results at energies above the  peak ( lep2 ) with those from data taken around the  peak ( lep1 ) to determine the mass of the  boson and the size of the @xmath0  interference contribution within the framework of the s - matrix formalism  @xcite . including data at higher energies",
    "also allows us to extend the searches for new physics presented in  @xcite .",
    "in particular we obtain improved limits on the energy scale of a possible four - fermion contact interaction , and also present limits on the mass of a possible heavy  boson .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] we discuss the signal definition , theoretical considerations and the corrections made to the data to obtain measurements corresponding to this definition . the data and monte carlo samples used in the analysis are described in section  [ sec : datamc ] , while section  [ sec : meas ] describes the data analysis and the cross - section and asymmetry measurements . in section  [ sec : sm ]",
    "we compare our measurements to the predictions of the standard model and use them to measure the energy dependence of @xmath100 .",
    "the s - matrix analysis is presented in section  [ sec : smat ] and the results of searches for new physics in section  [ sec : new_phys ] .",
    "to make precise tests of the standard model , the measurements of two - fermion processes must be compared with theoretical predictions calculated by , for example , the semi - analytical program  @xcite .",
    "we therefore need a signal definition for which the theoretical predictions can be made , and also which corresponds closely to the experimental measurements .",
    "the definition of the two - fermion signal used in this paper is the same as in previous publications  @xcite . for the @xmath90 final state it is described in section  [ sec : theory_ee ] below . for hadronic , @xmath94 and @xmath95 final states",
    "it is as follows :    * @xmath96 is defined as the square of the mass of the /@xmath0 propagator .",
    "a ` non - radiative ' sample of events is defined by @xmath97 , while inclusive measurements correspond to @xmath98 .",
    "* interference between initial- and final - state radiation makes the definition of @xmath96 ambiguous . to remove this ambiguity ,",
    "the predicted contribution of interference is subtracted from the measured cross - sections , as described in section  [ sec : ifsr ] . * four - fermion final states with a secondary pair arising from an initial - state photon in an @xmath88-channel diagram ( i.e.  initial state non - singlet photon diagrams , isns@xmath101  @xcite )",
    "are considered to be signal if the primary pair passes the @xmath96 cut .",
    "four - fermion final states arising from final - state photon diagrams ( fs@xmath101 ) are included in the signal .",
    "this corresponds to definition 1 from  @xcite page 346 .",
    "the procedure is discussed in detail in section  [ sec:4f ] . *",
    "cross - section and asymmetry measurements are corrected to full @xmath102 acceptance .",
    "the data include the effects of interference between initial- and final - state radiation , which needs to be subtracted from the measurements to form an unambiguous signal definition for comparison with theoretical predictions .",
    "we have investigated two methods of performing this subtraction .",
    "the first method is identical to that used in previous analyses , described fully in  @xcite .",
    "we define a differential ` interference cross - section ' , d@xmath103/d@xmath104 d , as the difference between the differential cross - section including interference between initial- and final - state radiation and that excluding interference , as calculated by",
    ". the differential interference cross - section may be either positive or negative , depending on the values of the cosine of the angle @xmath105 between the fermion and the electron beam direction , and the invariant mass of the fermion pair @xmath104 .",
    "we then estimate the fraction of this cross - section accepted by our selection cuts by assuming that , as a function of @xmath106 and @xmath104 , its selection efficiency @xmath107 is equal to @xmath108 , where @xmath109 has been determined from monte carlo events which do not include interference .",
    "the selected interference cross - section is then subtracted from the measured cross - section before efficiency correction , as for other backgrounds .",
    "as the accepted cross - section is estimated as a function of @xmath106 , the correction is easily applied to total cross - sections , angular distributions or asymmetry measurements .",
    "the second method investigated uses special samples of monte carlo events generated with the  program  @xcite .",
    "these samples were generated including initial - final - state photon interference with event weights allowing them to be reweighted to exclude the effects of interference . applying selection cuts to these samples allowed the accepted ` interference cross - section ' to be determined .",
    "the accepted cross - sections were in good agreement with those derived from the first method . in the case of hadronic events ,",
    "the average of the two methods was used to correct the data and half the difference between them taken as the associated systematic error . for  and",
    "final states the first method was used . as at lower energies",
    ", the systematic error was assessed by repeating the estimate assuming that the efficiency in each bin of  and @xmath104 was increased by half its difference with respect to the efficiency at @xmath110 at the same .",
    "the corrections to the final measured cross - sections and asymmetry measurements are given in table  [ tab : ifsr ] .",
    "the treatment of the four - fermion contribution to the two - fermion final states is similar to that at lower energies .",
    "secondary pairs arising from initial - state photons in @xmath88-channel diagrams ( isns@xmath101 ) are considered to be signal if the primary pair satisfies the @xmath96 cut .",
    "pairs arising from final - state photons ( fs@xmath101 ) are always considered to be signal .",
    "the overall efficiency of event selection cuts @xmath111 is calculated as @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the efficiencies derived from two - fermion and four - fermion signal monte carlo events respectively , @xmath115 is the generated four - fermion signal cross - section , and @xmath116 is the total cross - section from  including pair emission . using this definition of efficiency , effects of cuts on soft pair emission in the four - fermion generator are correctly summed with vertex corrections involving virtual pairs .",
    "for these analyses , a change has been made to the method used to separate the signal contribution from the background contribution in the four - fermion monte carlo events . at lower energies ,",
    "separate samples of @xmath88-channel and @xmath91-channel four - fermion monte carlo events were generated , and the signal contribution was defined by kinematic cuts on the @xmath88-channel events , designed to include pair production via an initial - state photon but to exclude pair production via a z boson . in this analysis , monte carlo samples including all four - fermion diagrams , generated with either the grc4f  @xcite program or with  @xcite with grc4f matrix elements , were used . each event was given a weight to be signal ( or background ) calculated using the matrix elements of the appropriate diagrams .",
    "this method gives a definition of signal which is closer to that employed in the semi - analytic calculations with which we compare our results , and also avoids the necessity of generating special monte carlo samples .",
    "the inclusion of the four - fermion part of the signal reduces efficiencies by about 0.3% for inclusive hadrons , 0.8% for inclusive muons and",
    "1% for inclusive taus . for non - radiative events",
    "the effects are much smaller , less than 0.02% for hadrons and around 0.2% for muons and taus .",
    "the discussion above applies to hadronic ,  and  final states .",
    "because of ambiguities arising from the @xmath91-channel contribution , the acceptance for the  final state is defined in terms of the angle @xmath105 of the electron or positron with respect to the electron beam direction and the acollinearity angle @xmath117 between the electron and positron ; a cut on @xmath96 is not used .",
    "it is thus unnecessary to subtract interference between initial- and final - state radiation to make an unambiguous signal definition .",
    "cross - sections and asymmetries for  are not corrected for interference between initial- and final - state radiation ; they are compared to theoretical predictions which include interference . in principle the @xmath91-channel process with a second fermion pair arising from the conversion of a virtual photon emitted from an initial- or final - state electron should be included as signal , as well as the @xmath88-channel diagrams . diagrams with real pairs are included in four - fermion monte carlo generators , but diagrams with virtual pairs are not included , and neither real nor virtual pairs are included in the program we use for comparison with the data .",
    "it would be improper to treat real pairs alone either as signal or background .",
    "we choose the best alternative , and simply ignore such events in both efficiency and background calculations .",
    "if the efficiency for four - fermion events is similar to that for two - fermion events , as is expected to be the case here , we are effectively comparing data including the four - fermion contribution to theory without .",
    "this does not introduce a large error because real and virtual pair contributions have opposite sign , and thus their effects tend to cancel in any total cross - section .",
    "the opal detector axis is along the electron beam direction and the @xmath118 axis is horizontal .",
    "the polar angle @xmath105 is measured with respect to the @xmath119 axis and the azimuthal angle @xmath120 with respect to the @xmath118 axis . ] , trigger and data acquisition system are fully described elsewhere  @xcite . the high redundancy of the trigger system leads to negligible trigger inefficiency for all channels discussed here .",
    "the analyses presented in this paper use data recorded during 1998 , 1999 and 2000 .",
    "the 1998 data were recorded at a centre - of - mass energy near 189  gev . in 1999 ,",
    "data were taken at four different centre - of - mass energy points , close to 192  gev , 196  gev , 200  gev and 202  gev . in 2000 , a small amount of data was taken at centre - of - mass energies near 200  gev and 202  gev ; these data have been included with the 200  gev and 202  gev data sets taken in 1999 .",
    "the bulk of the 2000 data was taken at a range of centre - of - mass energies between 203  gev and 209  gev , as shown in fig.[fig : lumi ] .",
    "also , in 2000 , the beam energy was changed within a run by a series of ` miniramps ' , resulting in a broad distribution of centre - of - mass energies rather than a series of discrete values as in previous years .",
    "data taken while the beam energy was changing and other data with a poor beam energy measurement have been removed from these analyses .",
    "these data amount to about 1.1% of the total 2000 data set . for analysis",
    "the good data have been divided into two centre - of - mass energy ranges : 202.5  gev ",
    "205.5  gev and @xmath121 205.5  gev ( henceforth referred to as 205  gev and 207  gev respectively ) ; these are the energy ranges used for the combination of data from all lep experiments . the mean centre - of - mass energy and approximate total integrated luminosity collected at each energy point",
    "are shown in table  [ tab : lumi ] ; the actual amount of data varies slightly from channel to channel because of differing requirements on data quality .",
    "the estimation of efficiencies and background processes makes extensive use of monte carlo simulations of many different final states . for studies of @xmath122 we used the  @xcite program ,",
    "version 4.13 . in  photon radiation",
    "is modelled using coherent exclusive exponentiation ( ceex ) and complete @xmath123 matrix elements for initial - state radiation are included .",
    "hadronization was performed according to the 6.150  @xcite string model .",
    "samples hadronized with the 6.2  @xcite cluster model or 4.11  @xcite colour dipole model were used for systematic studies . in all cases input parameters",
    "have been optimized by a study of global event shape variables and particle production rates in  decay data  @xcite .",
    "final - state radiation from quarks was simulated as part of the hadronization process , and not by the  program .",
    "for @xmath124 we used the 1.04  @xcite monte carlo program , and for @xmath125 and @xmath126  was used with 4.0  @xcite for comparison .",
    "four - fermion events were modelled with the grc4f  @xcite generator or with the  @xcite program with grc4f matrix elements .",
    "the latter has superior modelling of initial - state radiation in channels without electrons .",
    "final states containing quarks were hadronized using , with  and  used for systematic studies , as for the @xmath122 events .",

    "@xmath127 the  @xcite program ( with the ` perimiss ' option  @xcite ) ,  and  were used . in the following , the terms ` tagged ' and ` untagged ' are used to denote the high- and low-@xmath127 samples respectively .",
    "the bdk generator  @xcite was used to simulate two - photon processes resulting in @xmath128 and @xmath129 final states , while the vermaseren generator  @xcite was used for the @xmath130 final state .",
    "the @xmath131 background in the  final state was modelled with the  @xcite program , while the contribution from @xmath132 where the photon and one of the charged particles are inside the detector acceptance was modelled with  @xcite .",
    "monte carlo samples were generated at 189  gev , at the four nominal energy values of the data collected in 1999 , and at several energies spanning the range 204  gev to 208  gev for simulation of the data taken in 2000 .",
    "all samples were processed through the opal detector simulation program  @xcite and reconstructed in the same way as for real data .",
    "efficiencies and backgrounds at the centre - of - mass energy values corresponding to the data were determined by fitting the energy dependence of these quantities .    for the measurement of the luminosity , the cross - section for small - angle bhabha scattering was calculated using the monte carlo program  @xcite , using generated events processed through a program which parameterizes the response of the luminometer  @xcite .",
    "the integrated luminosity was measured using small - angle bhabha scattering events , @xmath133 , recorded in the silicon - tungsten luminometer  @xcite .",
    "the luminometer consisted of two finely segmented silicon - tungsten calorimeters placed around the beam pipe , symmetrically on the left and right sides of the opal detector , 2.5  m from the interaction point .",
    "each calorimeter covered angles from the beam between 25  mrad and 59  mrad .",
    "the luminosity determination closely followed the procedure used for the precise determination at lep1  @xcite .",
    "however , before lep2  data - taking , tungsten shields designed to protect the tracking detectors from synchrotron radiation were installed .",
    "these introduced about 50  radiation lengths of material in front of the calorimeter between 26  mrad and 33  mrad from the beam axis , thus reducing the useful acceptance of the detector .",
    "bhabha scattering events were selected by requiring a high energy cluster in each side of the detector , using asymmetric acceptance cuts .",
    "the energy in each calorimeter had to be at least half the beam energy , and the total energy in the fiducial region of both calorimeters had to be at least three quarters of the centre - of - mass energy .",
    "the two highest energy clusters were required to be back - to - back in @xmath120 , , where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the azimuthal angles of the cluster in the right- and left - hand calorimeter respectively .",
    "they were also required to be collinear , by placing a cut on the difference between the radial positions , @xmath136 , at @xmath137 2.5  cm , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the radial coordinates of the clusters on a plane approximately 7 radiation lengths into the calorimeter at @xmath140 .",
    "this cut , corresponding to an acollinearity angle of about 10.4  mrad , effectively defines the acceptance for single - photon radiative events , thus reducing the sensitivity of the measurement to the detailed energy response of the calorimeter .",
    "the distribution of @xmath141 for the data taken in the year 2000 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : swlumi](a ) .",
    "inner and outer radial acceptance cuts delimited a region between 38  mrad and 52  mrad on one side of the calorimeter , while for the opposite calorimeter a wider zone between 34  mrad and 56  mrad was used .",
    "two luminosity measurements were formed with the narrower acceptance on one side or the other side .",
    "the final measurement was the average of the two and has no first order dependence on beam offsets or tilts .",
    "the distributions of the radial coordinates of the clusters for the data taken in the year 2000 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : swlumi](b , c ) .",
    "the acceptance a of the luminosity measurement is affected by any change in the inner and outer edges of the acceptance as follows :    @xmath142    and @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 denote the radial coordinates of the inner and outer cuts .",
    "the coefficients in the expressions given above are determined by simple analytic calculations , using the @xmath146 bhabha spectrum , the nominal half distance between the reference planes of the two calorimeters and the inner and outer acceptance radii ( 9.45  cm and 12.7  cm ) .",
    "the residual bias on the inner and outer cut positions was estimated as at lep1 , by a procedure called _ anchoring _ , which is fully explained in @xcite . in this approach",
    "the fundamental tool is the radial position of the silicon pad with maximum signal in a given longitudinal layer . as the radial position of the incoming particles crosses a radial pad boundary in a single layer , the average pad - maximum moves rapidly from one pad to the next , giving an image of the pad boundary , as shown in fig .",

    "; this offset can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbimage ] . by applying equation  ( [ eq : rinner ] ) this is equivalent to an acceptance variation of + 0.14  % . at lep1",
    "the absolute value of the coordinate offset at the inner cut was less than 10  @xmath147 m . the larger value in lep2  data is attributed to the effects of about 2  radiation lengths of preshowering material , consisting of cables and beam pipe support structures , in front of the central angular region of the calorimeter including the position of the inner radial cut .",
    "the estimated systematic correction was applied to the measurement , but the full size of the effect was conservatively kept as a systematic error .",
    "the errors on the luminosity measurement at each energy are summarized in table  [ tab : lumi_errors ] .",
    "the experimental systematic error is dominated by the uncertainty of the inner radial cut . among the other errors",
    "are trigger efficiency ( 0.06% ) , energy response particularly in the low energy tail ( 0.03% ) , beam parameters ( 0.02% ) , backgrounds ( 0.02% ) and monte carlo statistics ( 0.08% ) , where all the numbers refer to year 2000 data but are fairly similar in the other data samples .",

    "the selection efficiency is typically @xmath9985% and the purity is @xmath9992% .    * to reject leptonic final states , events were required to have high multiplicity : at least 7  electromagnetic clusters and at least 5  tracks satisfying standard quality criteria  @xcite . *",
