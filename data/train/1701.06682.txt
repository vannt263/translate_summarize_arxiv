    "<S> within the framework of the relativistic vlasov - uehling - uhlenbeck transport model based on the relativistic nonlinear nl@xmath0 interaction , we study pion in - medium effects on the @xmath1 ratio in au+au collisions at the energy of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these effects include the isospin - dependent pion @xmath3-wave and @xmath4-wave potentials , which are taken from calculations based on the chiral perturbation theory and the @xmath5-hole model , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the @xmath1 ratio in this collision is suppressed by the pion @xmath3-wave potential but enhanced by the @xmath4-wave potential , with a net effect of a significantly suppressed @xmath1 ratio . </S>",
    "<S> including also the in - medium threshold effects on @xmath5 resonance production and decay and using a nuclear symmetry energy with a slope parameter @xmath6 by reducing the coupling of isovector - vector @xmath0 meson to nucleon , our result is in good agreement with measured @xmath1 ratio from the fopi collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> we further investigate the pion in - medium effects on the ratio of charged pions as a function of their kinetic energies . </S>"
