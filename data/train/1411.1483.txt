    "cloud radio access networks ( c - rans ) have received considerable research interest as one of the most promising solutions to mitigate interference , fulfil energy efficiency demands and support high - rate transmission in the fifth generation cellular network @xcite . in c - rans , a large number of remote radio heads ( rrhs ) are deployed , which operate as non - regenerative relays to forward received signals from mobile stations ( mss ) to the centralized base band unit ( bbu ) pool through wire / wireless backhaul links for uplink transmission @xcite . to suppress the inter - rrh interference by using cooperative processing techniques at the bbu pool ,",
    "the channel state information ( csi ) of both the radio access links ( als ) and wireless backhaul links ( bls ) are required@xcite . in @xcite , though a segment - training scheme was proposed to estimate the individual channel coefficients for two - hop scenario under flat fading environments , this proposal results in high overhead consumption for backhaul transmission since the rrhs need to forward both al and bl training sequences to the bbu pool @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the superimposed - training scheme @xcite , where a training sequence is superimposed on the data signal , can significantly reduce the overhead and is valid to perform channel estimation for time - varying environments using complex - exponential basis expansion model ( ce - bem ) @xcite .",
    "however , straightforward implementation of superimposed training in c - rans would degrade transmission quality due to the fact that superimposing both al and bl training sequences on the data signal declines the effective signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xcite .    motivated to reduce the training overhead and enhance the channel estimation performance at the bbu pool , a superimposed - segment training design is proposed in this letter , where superimposed - training is implemented for the radio al while the segment - training is applied for the wireless bl .",
    "moreover , based on the training design , a ce - bem based maximum a posteriori probability ( map ) channel estimation algorithm is developed , where the bem coefficients of the time - varying radio al and the channel fading of the quasi - static wireless bl are first obtained , after which the time - domain channel samples of the radio al are restored in terms of maximizing the average effective snr .",

    "consider a c - ran consisting of one bbu pool and multiple rrhs depicted in fig .",
    "the rrhs operate in half - duplex modes , and different mss served by the same rru are allocated with a single subcarrier through the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access ( ofdma ) technique .",
    "it is assumed that mss move continuously , while rrus remain fixed .",
    "thus , the channels of radio als would vary during one transmission block , while those of wireless bls undergo quasi - static flat fading . due to the orthogonality characteristics of ofdma for the accessing of multiple mss , we can focus on the transmission of only a single ms .",
