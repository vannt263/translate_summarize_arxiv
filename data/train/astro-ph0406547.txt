    "the rates of supernovae ( sne ) at different redshifts provide important information about the evolution of a number of physical processes over cosmic times . as core collapse sne ( i.e.",
    ", type ii and ibc supernovae , hereafter cc sne ) originate from massive short - lived stars , the rate of these events should reflect on - going star formation and therefore offers an independent way to determine the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) . furthermore , the sn rate ( snr ) directly probes the metal production at different cosmological epochs .",
    "type ia sne do not directly follow the sfr since there is a delay between the formation of the progenitor star and the explosion of the sn . constraining",
    "this delay time is important for a better understanding of the processes leading to the type ia explosions , and therefore essential for the usefulness of type ia sne as cosmological distance indicators . with accurate measurements of the sn ia rate",
    ", it should be possible to set constraints on this poorly known delay time as discussed in e.g. , madau , della valle , & panagia ( 1998 ) and dahlen & fransson ( 1999 ) . a first attempt to constrain the delay time using observations",
    "is presented in gal - yam & maoz ( 2004 ) and maoz & gal - yam ( 2004 ) .",

    "local and nearby sn ia rates have been measured in the field by numerous surveys , e.g. , at redshifts @xmath10  ( cappellaro , evans , & turatto 1999 ) , @xmath11  ( hardin et al . 2000 ) , @xmath12  ( strolger 2003 ) , and @xmath13  ( reiss 2000 ) .",
    "similarly , at larger distances , rates have been measured at @xmath14  ( pain et al . 1996 ) , @xmath15  ( tonry et al . 2003 ) , and @xmath16  ( pain et al . 2002 ) . while rates at @xmath17  are in general higher than the local rates , these measurements are still consistent with a constant type ia rate out to @xmath00.6 ( tonry et al .",

    "the resulting completeness limit is @xmath27 , defined as the magnitude where 50% of these sources where recovered .      the goods sn sample consists of 42 sne detected in both cdf - s and hdf - n . for 29 of these",

    "we only lack redshift for one sn with no apparent host galaxy .",
    "we wish to differentiate between type ia and cc sne when calculating rates since these types originate from different progenitors and explosion mechanisms .",
    "it is therefore essential to conduct accurate type determination for the full sample .",
    "we divide the sne into types using all available information including spectra , redshifts of sne or host galaxies , magnitudes , colors and light curve shapes .",
    "we find that 25 sne are consistent with being type ia , with the remaining 17 being cc sne .",
    "we are most confident in the type determination of 20 of the ia and 7 of the cc sne . for the remaining ones ,",
    "the type determination is less certain and a few may be misclassified .",
    "when calculating rates , we account for this by including possible misclassifications in the systematic errors .",
    "in this paper , we express snrs in units of number of exploding sne per rest - frame year and comoving volume element ( i.e. , yr@xmath24mpc@xmath28 ) .",
    "alternatively , rates can be expressed in supernova units , snu s ( 1 snu = 1 sn per 100 year per 10@xmath29 ) , which are normalized to the @xmath30-band luminosity density , and are preferentially used for local measurements .",
    "we do not use snu s because this introduces further uncertainty in surveys covering cosmological distances where the rest - frame @xmath30-band luminosity and its evolution has to be determined to provide proper rates in snu s .",
    "when we compare local rates given in snu s with rates per volume , we convert units assuming a local @xmath30-band luminosity density 2.0@xmath31mpc@xmath28 , approximately evolving as @xmath32 at @xmath331 ( strolger 2003 ) .",
    "the redshift correction is , however , small since the highest redshift we convert is @xmath34 .",
    "we use monte carlo ( mc ) simulations to calculate the underlying snr that is consistent with observations .",
    "this is done separately for cc and type ia sne .",
    "we start by assuming an input snr and use this to calculate the number of sne exploding each year within a volume given by the field - of - view and the redshift range of interest .",
    "each sn is assigned a peak magnitude , a random epoch on the light curve , a host galaxy extinction and a redshift .",
    "the apparent magnitude is thereafter calculated at this epoch on the light curve , as well as at an earlier epoch separated in rest - frame by @xmath35 days , corresponding to the 45 day spacing between observations . by subtracting the fluxes between the two epochs",
    ", we derive a detection magnitude , @xmath36 , and the direction of the magnitude change , i.e. , if the sn is rising or declining .",
    "this gives us a list of simulated sne with known detection magnitudes and redshifts .",
    "the mc simulation is repeated 10,000 times to calculate the mean number of detectable sne for a specified search set - up .",
    "finally , to determine the observed rate , we adjust the input rate to match the number of detected sne in a chosen redshift bin .    calculating",
    "the apparent magnitude of the sne in the simulations includes specifying a number of sn characteristics .",
    "after the following general formula , we specify the cc and sn ia characteristics in the two next subsections . the apparent magnitude in the observed filter @xmath37 for a sn at redshift @xmath9 which is at time @xmath38 relative to the light curve peak in the observers frame is given by    m_f850lp(t , z)=m_peak , + m_[t(1+z)^-1 ]    @xmath39+{\\rm a}_{\\lambda}\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 is the peak absolute magnitude in a rest - frame filter @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the light curve decline relative to the peak , @xmath43 is the distance modulus .",
    "the k - correction , @xmath44 , is calculated using the formalism in kim , goobar , & perlmutter ( 1996 ) and includes information on the spectral sed of the sn together with appropriate filter transmission curves and qe for the detector used .",
    "finally , a@xmath45 is the extinction in the sn host galaxy .",
    "this is further described below .",
    "cc sne can be divided into a number of different subtypes , characterized by e.g. , light curve decline , spectral features or peak magnitude .",
    "we adopt the division into subtypes given in richardson et al .",
    "here cc sne are divided into ibc , iil , iip and iin , where the ibc and iil types are further divided into a normal and a bright population , while the iip type is divided into a normal and a faint population .",
    "a summary of peak @xmath30-band magnitudes and corresponding dispersions are given in table 1 .",
    "we use the intrinsic fractions of subtypes given in dahlen & fransson ( 1999 ) , with the addition of 1% of the sne assigned to a bright population as proposed by richardson et al .",
    "this bright population is further divided so that half are ibc and half iil .",
    "note that the division into different types is highly uncertain .",
    "also , the intrinsic fractions may change with redshift ( metallicity ) . in   5.1.1 , we investigate how the subdivision into subtypes affects the results .",
    "to obtain k - corrections , we use the approach in dahlen & fransson ( 1999 ) , where the sn spectra are characterized by black bodies with temperatures evolving from @xmath125,000k near explosion to @xmath15,000k at late stages .",
    "we use these models since there does not exist a full sample of observed cc sn spectra of different subtypes and epochs on the light curve covering a sufficiently large range in wavelength to calculate k - corrections . for particular sne ( e.g. , 1999em ) with good observational coverage , we find that the blackbody approximation and observed spectra yield similar k - corrections , with deviations mostly @xmath46 0.1 mag .",
    "this is typically less than the photometric uncertainty in the observed cc sne , justifying the use of the blackbody approximation .",
    "light curves for ibc , iil , and iip are taken from filippenko ( 1997 ) , while for iin , we use a light curve intermediate between iil and iip .",
    "cc sne should preferentially occur in star bursting regions within the host galaxy .",
    "we therefore use a starburst extinction law ( calzetti et al .",
    "2000 ) when calculating absorption of the sn due to dust in the host galaxy .",
    "furthermore , we use a mean color excess @xmath47=0.15 .",
    "the details of dust extinction , especially in star forming regions , are , however , highly uncertain and in   5.1.1 , we thoroughly investigate how different assumptions about the extinction affects results .",
    "each sn is placed in a disk with random inclination .",
    "the extinction is thereafter calculated by integrating the light path through the host galaxy using the recipe in hatano , branch , & deaton ( 1998 ) .",
    "this leads to a distribution of extinctions that peaks at low values , a@xmath48 , but that also shows a tail with high extinction values ( a@xmath49 ) , originating from highly inclined host galaxies .      to characterize type ia sne",
    ", we use the peak magnitude distributions in tonry et al .",

    "the sne are distributed within these three distributions so that 20% are bright , 64% are normal , and the remaining 16% are dim ( li et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "k - corrections are calculated using a set of observed spectral templates from sn1994d , observed at days 5 , 0 , 5 , 9 , 17 , and 55 relative to peak in light curve .",

    "this is consistent with the fraction @xmath130% found by farrah et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , as well as preliminary results from the goods sn sample .",
    "the scale height used for the disk in hatano et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is larger than for the cc sne , leading to lower mean absorption for sn ia . for both bulge and disk components ,",
    "the distribution of host galaxy @xmath30-band absorption has a very dominating peak at low extinctions ( a@xmath48 ) .",
    "there is , however , also a narrow tail out to high extinctions ( a@xmath52 ) , especially for sne occurring in inclined disks .",
    "the overall distribution of extinctions can be approximated by an exponential , @xmath53(a@xmath54 , consistent with the observed distribution of sn ia absorption in jha et al .",
    "using the method described above , we calculate the cc snr in two redshift bins @xmath55  and @xmath56 , which is the first measurement of cc sn rates at cosmological distances .",
    "the resulting rates are 2.51@xmath57  and 3.96@xmath58 in the two bins , respectively ( table 2 ) .",

    "the second quoted errors are systematic and include e.g. , the possibility of misclassification of sn type .",
    "systematic errors are further discussed in  5.1.1 .",

    "nevertheless , this is the first time it has been measured , supporting the general shape of the star formation history as predicted from e.g. , measurements of galaxy uv - luminosities .",
    "we revisit this discussion below .",
    "with sufficient knowledge of how a star becomes a sn , it is possible to calculate the relation between the sfr and the snr .",
    "depending on the nature of the relation , it is possible to either use the snr as a probe for the sfr , or to use independently determined sfrs and snrs to investigate the relation between the two and extract information about the nature of the sn progenitors .",
    "for cc sne , the relation between sfr and snr is fairly straightforward since the progenitors are massive stars with life times spanning only a small fraction of the hubble time .",

    "first , we examine how the results change under the assumption that all cc sne are of a single type represented by the sn iip characteristics .",
    "we find that the resulting number of expected sn decreases by @xmath115% , which is less than the statistical errors and suggests that results are not highly dependent on the exact division into subtypes .",
    "the reason for this weak dependence is that omitting both the bright and the faint sub - populations cancels most of the net effect",

    "excluding the bright ibc and iil population only changes the result by 3% , while an exclusion of the faint iip population changes the rate by at most 15% , both changes are less than statistical errors .",
    "next we examine how much we have to increase the fractions of faint or bright sne in order to change the predicted number by @xmath103 .",

    "* _ imf_. the constant @xmath88  in equation ( 2 ) depends on the imf and the assumed mass range for the progenitor stars . changing the shape of the imf assuming a scalo imf ( scalo 1986 ) instead of the salpeter imf , decreases @xmath88 by a factor 2.6 . however , changing the imf also changes the conversion from observed uv - luminosities to estimated sfrs . for a scalo imf ,",
    "the conversion factor increases by a factor @xmath12 , i.e. , the net effect of changing the imf is therefore a decrease in @xmath88 by @xmath130% , which increases the measured sfr by the same amount .",
    "again this does not exceed the statistical error in the derived rates . * _ progenitor mass range_. we have chosen 50@xmath90 as the upper limit to the progenitor mass since it is believed that more massive star become black holes without exploding as sne ( tsujimoto et al .",

    "the steep slope of the imf , increasing the upper limit to 125@xmath90 , only increases the factor @xmath88  by 7% . if we instead lower the upper limit to 30@xmath90 , we get a resulting decrease in @xmath88 by 9% .",
    "a more significant change in @xmath88 comes from changing the lower mass limit of the progenitor stars . to change @xmath88",
    "corresponding to @xmath103 , we have to increase the lower integration limit to 10.2@xmath90 .",
    "this could be possible since the lower mass range of cc sne is not well constrained and is estimated to be in the interval @xmath111  ( timmes , woosley , & weaver 1996 ) . * _ hubble constant_. finally , the relation between snr and sfr depends on the hubble constant to the second power .",
    "according to spergel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the error in the determination of @xmath112  is less than 5% , suggesting that the uncertainty due to the @xmath94  factor in equation ( 3 ) , should be @xmath110% , clearly less than statistical errors . note that the comparison between the sfrs derived from luminosity densities and snrs respectively , provides a method for determining @xmath112 . for a stringent determination of @xmath112 , both statistical and systematic errors must , however , be significantly better constrained than is possible today . at face values , we can take our observed rates and compare to the sfr derived from uv - luminosity densities to calculate @xmath112 . this exercise results in @xmath112=66@xmath113  km",
    "s@xmath24  mpc@xmath24 , where errors are statistical and represent 1@xmath51 .",
    "errors introduced by systematic effects described above are mostly non - gaussian , and it is difficult to estimate the total effect of the uncertainty on the results . for the snr , only assumptions about dust extinction may have a significant effect on the rates .",
    "when deriving the sfr from the snr , we add sources with possible systematic effects .",
    "to estimate the total error , we make the assumption that the uncertainty in peak magnitudes introduces a 5% error , while division into subtypes introduce an additional 15% uncertainty . furthermore , we assume uncertainties due to dust extinction 10% and 20% in the two redshift bins , respectively .",
    "this results in a total error in the snr of @xmath114 , equivalent to @xmath115 . for the sfr derived from the cc snr",
    ", we add three possible sources of statistical errors as shown by the listed points above .",
    "assuming that each of these introduce a 10 - 15% uncertainty would lead to a systematic error that is of the same order as the statistical error ( @xmath116 ) .    to investigate if the strong significance of the increased snr in the redshift range @xmath117 found in  5.1 decreases when taking systematic effects into account , we assume systematic errors @xmath118 , as derived above . in section",
    " 5.1 , we found that a flat cc rate could be rejected with 99.9% probability , based on statistical errors only . adding the estimated systematic errors decreases this probability to 99.4% , which is still significant .",
    "we also note that the systematic effects discussed above are mostly independent of redshift .",
    "this implies that the relative increase in snr over the redshift range observed should remain the same , and therefore supporting an increase in sfr , even if the absolute normalization of our determined rates may have a systematic offset .",
    "only the assumptions about the amount of dust extinction have a strong redshift dependent effect on the derived rates . assuming a higher extinction results in a steeper increase with redshift of the estimated rates , as can be seen in figure [ figure1 ] by comparing the corrected and uncorrected data points .    in summary",
    ", there are a number of possible sources for systematic errors in our estimates , however , most errors are relatively small , not exceeding the statistical errors . for the snr",
    ", we estimate that the summed systematic errors should be smaller than the statistical , while the systematic errors may be of the same order as the statistical when it comes to the sfr derived from the snr .",
    "since we have shown that systematic errors are unlikely to dominate over the statistical , and that they are mostly independent of redshift , we are confident that the increase in supernova and star formation rates we observe are true features . the main concern is the amount of dust extinction .",
    "the effects of changes in the dust extinction are further discussed in  6 .",
    "when we derive the sfr from the snr , we also note that the direction of the errors is mainly to increase the observed rates , e.g. , this is the case if the lower limit for cc progenitor mass is larger than 8@xmath90 , if the imf is changed to become less top heavy or if the amount of dust extinction is underestimated .",
    "we finally note that the quoted systematic errors in table 2 are sums of the 19 - 25% uncertainty derived above , and the uncertainty due to possible misclassification .",
    "these errors are therefore non - gaussian .      even though the physics behind type ia sne has been extensively investigated using both observations and theoretical simulations , there is still a lack of understanding of the mechanisms that proceed the explosion of this sn type ( see livio 2000 , 2001 for reviews ) . the evolution of the type ia snr should follow the sfr , but shifted towards lower redshift after taking a delay time into account . for a particular distribution of delay times , @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the time elapsed between the formation of the progenitor star and the explosion of the sn ia , the snr is given by a convolution of the sfr over delay times @xmath121 where @xmath38  is the age of the universe and @xmath122  is the time corresponding to the redshift , @xmath123 , where the first stars formed .",

    "we do , however , note that there may be corrections to the derived rates . with the systematic effects being of the same order of magnitude as the statistical errors , it is necessary to increase the statistical sample , as well as learn more about systematic effects , in order to significantly reduce errors .",
    "note , however , that uncertainties involved in deriving the sfr from high redshift galaxy uv - luminosities are also most certainly affected by systematic effects and unknown details regarding e.g. , dust extinction and imf , leading to uncertainties that should be of the same order of magnitude .",

    "a caveat is , however , that cc sne are relatively faint , and it will be challenging to derive a sufficiently large , as well as complete , sample at redshifts exceeding @xmath168 , until the next generation of telescopes are operational .",
    "the results from type ia rates clearly show an increase in the rate to @xmath0  1 , thereafter the rate flattens and shows a suggested decrease in the redshift range @xmath169 . deriving a snr with this shape from a sfr scenario that is consistent with recent observations of the uv - luminosity density ,",
    "requires that there is a significant delay between the star formation and the subsequent explosion of the ia sne . in strolger",
    "et al . ( 2004 ) , we showed that a narrow gaussian distribution of delay times best fits our observations .",
    "however , other functional forms for the delay time may also be consistent with observations as long as the characteristic time delay , @xmath128 , is @xmath170  2 gyr . here",
    "we have shown that the narrow gaussian distribution is best - fitting also when we enlarge our sample of observed rates by rates taken from the literature .",
    "to further constrain the characteristic time delay @xmath128 , as well as the functional forms of the delay time , it is necessary to determine the shape of the sfr to greater detail than known today .",
    "especially , an increased redshift coverage will make it possible to set firmer constraints on @xmath128 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ figure2 ] , where models diverge significantly at higher redshift @xmath6  2 .",
    "alternatively , if studies of sn ia can reveal the mechanisms that lead to the explosion , i.e. , determining the distribution of delay times , then it will be possible to set firmer constraints on the sfr using the observed snr .",
    "using a unique sample of high redshift supernovae obtained with the acs on - board hst , we have calculated the rates of core collapse sne to @xmath0  0.7 and type ia sne to @xmath0  1.6 .",
    "these redshifts are significantly higher than those where rates have previously been measured .",
    "we find a core collapse sn rate that is a factor @xmath1  1.6 higher at @xmath171  0.7 than at @xmath171  0.3 . compared to local rates",
    ", we find an increase in the rate by a factor @xmath1  7 over the redshift range @xmath117 . relating the sn rate with the star formation rate , we find that this increase is consistent with the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate measured from extinction corrected galaxy uv - luminosity densities .",
    "the rates we derive are also consistent with the star formation rate estimated from mid- and far - ir luminosity densities , even though the data do not fit as well as with the uv - luminosity density .",
    "a better fit with the ir derived star formation rate would be achieved in a scenario where the dust extinction increases with redshift .",
    "these first measurements of the sfr based on cc sne are affected by both statistical uncertainties and possible systematic errors , as extensively discussed above . however , most of these errors are independent of redshift",
    ". therefore , the relative increase in the sfr with redshift is robust .",
    "the type ia sn rate shows a significant increase to @xmath0  1 , compared to measurements at @xmath4 taken from the literature . in the redshift range @xmath172",
    ", we find a snr that is consistent with decreasing . when fitting observed rates to those derived from observed star formation rates combined with different assumptions on the sn ia delay time distributions , we find that the observed shape of the ia rate is most consistent with models assuming a significant delay time between the epoch of star formation and the explosion of the ia sn .",
    "we find characteristic delay times @xmath173  2 gyr are consistent with data .",
    "this provides further support to arguments favoring single - degenerate scenarios for the progenitors of sne ia ( livio 2001 ) .",
    "fitting observations to models also provide estimates of the fraction of formed stars that eventually explode as sn ia . assuming a salpeter imf and a progenitor main sequence mass range @xmath7",
    ", we find that @xmath8% of the white dwarfs formed from these progenitor stars subsequently explode as sne ia . furthermore , if we assume that all stars with main sequence masses @xmath155 become white dwarfs , then @xmath156% of these will turn into sne .",
    "investigating the intrinsic ratio of exploding cc to ia sne results in a ratio @xmath1  3 , which is fairly constant up to @xmath0  0.7 . at higher redshifts the ratio increases , reflecting the fact that a long delay time for ia progenitors shifts the rate towards lower redshift compared to the sfr and therefore also the cc snr .    to set firm constraints on the sfr using core collapse sne , as well as determining the distribution of delay times for sne ia progenitors",
    ", it is of great importance not only to increase the sample size ( i.e. decrease statistical errors ) , but also to better understand sn characteristics . nevertheless , using available information on sn statistics and characteristics , combined with the unique sample of high redshift sne provided by the goods",
    ", we have already shown that using high redshift supernova rates can provide important information about the properties and the evolution of stars and star formation in the universe at earlier cosmic epochs .",
