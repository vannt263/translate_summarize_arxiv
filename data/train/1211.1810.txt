    "the term frustration was first introduced into magnetism by toulouse @xcite . according to the original concept ,",
    "the frustration is basically a topological property and refers to a negative sign of the product of coupling constants implying an incapability of spins to satisfy all pair spin - spin interactions between them .",
    "one of the simplest frustrated spin systems is the ising model on a triangular lattice with the unique antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor coupling @xcite . for many years",
    ", frustrated spin systems have been widely studied mainly in connection with their unconventional low - temperature behavior and reentrant phase transitions ( see refs . @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "an alternative definition of the spin frustration was introduced by dos santos and lyra , which have proposed a negative sign of the product of pair correlation functions as another useful hallmark of the spin frustration @xcite .",
    "this latter definition has an advantage in that it provides plausible criterion whether or not the spin system is frustrated at finite ( non - zero ) temperature as well .",
    "recently , quantum spin chains have attracted a lot of attention as they provide an useful playground for the investigation of thermal entanglement and moreover , they represent promising candidates for the quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that the entanglement is one of the most exciting properties of quantum systems , which does not have any classical analog and is most clearly manifested at zero temperature .",
    "however , thermal fluctuations gradually destroy the quantum entanglement , which may finally completely disappear above a certain temperature called as the threshold temperature @xcite .",
    "a theoretical investigation of the heisenberg model on a two - leg ladder is motivated not only from the theoretical point of view , but also from the experimental viewpoint @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the frustrated heisenberg model on a two - leg ladder can not be rigorously solved quite generally and there exist only few exact results for some special cases , such as the heisenberg tetrahedral chain @xcite or the heisenberg ladder with the first- and second - neighbor interaction exhibiting an exact dimer ground state @xcite .",
    "owing to this fact , different powerful analytical and numerical approaches have been employed in order to examine the magnetic behavior of the frustrated heisenberg two - leg ladder ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) . on the other hand",
    ", the ground state of frustrated ising - heisenberg ladder can be rigorously attained from a precise mapping correspondence with the quantum ising chain of composite spins and this model still displays typical quantum features including remarkable quantum phase transitions as discussed in detail by verkholyak and streka @xcite .",
    "other similar exact studies of the ground state have been performed for the slightly different ising - heisenberg chains made up of corner sharing double - tetrahedra @xcite .",
    "recently , the magneto - caloric properties of the ising two - leg ladder was discussed within the framework of the transfer - matrix approach @xcite .",
    "another interesting quantum spin model represents the heisenberg tetrahedral chain developed by niggemann _",
    "et al_. @xcite , whose ground state and thermodynamic properties can be obtained from the local gauge symmetry revealing the hidden ising symmetry . in the present work , we will exactly treat the analogous ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain with the aim to examine thermal properties ( partition function , free energy , specific heat and correlation functions ) in addition to the ground state .",
    "the outline of this letter is as follows .",
    "the tetrahedral ising - heisenberg chain is introduced in sec .",
    "2 together with its ground - state phase diagram . in sec .",
    "3 we present basic steps of the calculation procedure suitable for evaluating finite - temperature properties such as the correlation functions , the frustration temperature , the threshold temperature for bipartite entanglement , as well as , the zero - field specific heat . finally , we will draw our conclusions and summarize the most important findings in sec .",
    "motivated by the comments given in the introduction , let us consider the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg chain of edge - sharing tetrahedra as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . for easy reference ,",
    "the investigated spin system will be hereafter referred to as the ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain and it may be alternatively viewed as the particular case of the ising - heisenberg two - leg ladder @xcite with a heisenberg intra - rung interaction and a unique ising interaction along the legs and diagonals , respectively ( see fig .  [ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) denote spatial components @xmath4 of the spin-@xmath0 pauli operator at a site labeled by suffix @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "note furthermore that the interaction terms @xmath8 and @xmath9 determine the spatially anisotropic xxz heisenberg coupling , whereas the interaction term @xmath10 represents the ising coupling .    to proceed further with calculations ,",
    "let us introduce three spatial components of the total spin angular momentum @xmath11 for two spins coupled by the heisenberg interaction . using the above definition",
    "one simply obtains the identity @xmath12 , which allows us to express both parts of the heisenberg interaction in terms of two commuting operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 it is quite obvious from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : spin - transf ] ) and ( [ eq : spin - transf-1 ] ) that the heisenberg interaction can be rewritten with the help of total spin angular momentum @xmath17 and its @xmath18th spatial component @xmath14 , which correspond to conserved quantities with well defined quantum spin numbers @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "besides , the ising interaction as the other interaction term entering the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham - orig ] ) can also be trivially expressed by means of the spin operator @xmath14 . bearing all this in mind",
    ", the hamiltonian of the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain can be decomposed into two parts @xmath21 , whereas @xmath22 and @xmath23\\right\\}. \\label{eq : ham - eff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] up to unimportant constant term @xmath24 , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham - orig ] ) of the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain can be rigorously mapped to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham - eff ] ) of the classical chain of composite ising spins , since the quantum spin number for the total angular momentum is either @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the ising interaction @xmath27 directly determines the effective nearest - neighbor interaction in the equivalent classical chain of composite ising spins , while the spatial anisotropy in the xxz heisenberg interaction determines the effective single - ion anisotropy @xmath28 acting on the composite spins .",
    "it should be emphasized , moreover , that the relevant gauge transformation directly brings the effective hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham - eff ] ) into a diagonal form .",
    "hence , one easily obtains also a diagonal form for the hamiltonian of the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain @xmath29\\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & \\left.+j_{1 } s_{i}^{z}s_{i+1}^{z}+\\frac{j_{z}-j_x}{4}\\left[\\left(s_{i}^{z}\\right)^{2}+\\left(s_{i+1}^{z}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\right\\}. \\label{eq : diagham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is worthwhile to remark that the transformation between the quantum tetrahedral spin chain and the classical chain of composite spins is only possible because the total spin of the heisenberg bonds is locally conserved quantity for the hamiltonian whenever the ising interactions along the legs and diagonals are identical .",
    "if both the ising interactions would be different , the total spin of the heisenberg bonds does not represent the locally conserved quantity and this would consequently prevent a rigorous mapping onto the classical chain of composite spins even though the investigated spin system could still be mapped onto the quantum ising chain of composite spins @xcite .",
    "however , the latter quantum chain of composite spins can exactly be treated only at zero temperature unlike the former classical chain of composite spins ( see sec . 3 ) .",
    "it should be also noted here that the heisenberg tetrahedral chain under the local gauge symmetry has been studied by niggeman _",
    "et al_. @xcite when combining the fragmentation approach with numerical calculations , while the relevant high - temperature expansion has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .      the diagonalized form of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : diagham ] ) can be straightforwardly used in order to obtain all possible ground states of the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq : diagham ] ) implies an existence of four different ground states , namely , the ferromagnetic state ( fm ) , the superantiferromagnetic state ( sa ) , the triplet - dimer state ( td ) , and the singlet - dimer state ( sd ) , which are unambiguously given by the following eigenvectors @xmath30 in above , the upper @xmath31 sign applies for @xmath32 and the lower @xmath31 sign stands for @xmath33 .",
    "the corresponding energy per unit cell for each individual ground state reads @xmath34 by making use of the eigenenergies ( [ ee ] ) we have constructed the zero - temperature phase diagram , which is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : gs ] in the @xmath35 plane .",
    "the disordered sd state with singlet dimers placed on all heisenberg bonds becomes the ground state whenever @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "on the other hand , the similar disordered td state is being the respective ground state if @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the most fundamental difference between td and sd states lies in the symmetric versus antisymmetric quantum superposition of two antiferromagnetic states as evidenced by the eigenvectors and , respectively .",
    "note furthermore that td and sd ground states are of a purely quantum nature , whereas they become the relevant ground states only if the intra - rung heisenberg interaction is sufficiently strong .",
    "finally , the less interesting classical fm ( sa ) state without any quantum correlations constitutes the ground state for @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) on assumption that @xmath42 .",
    "in this part , let us calculate finite - temperature properties of the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain . to gain the partition function , it is quite convenient to adopt a trace invariance and to calculate the partition function using the diagonalized form of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : diagham ] ) @xmath43 here , @xmath44 , @xmath45 is being the boltzmann s constant and @xmath46 is the absolute temperature .",
    "let us first rewrite the diagonalized form of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : diagham ] ) into the following compact form @xmath47 with the hamiltonian @xmath48 defined as @xmath49 \\nonumber \\\\ & - \\frac{j_x}{4 } \\left[s_i(s_i + 1 ) + s_{i+1}(s_{i+1 } + 1 ) \\right ] .",

    "@xmath50 and the latter expression behind the product symbol can be subsequently identified as the usual transfer matrix @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "hence , it follows that the partition function can be evaluated by the standard transfer - matrix approach @xcite .",

    "the short - range correlation functions can in turn be calculated by differentiating the free energy with respect to the relevant coupling constant .",
    "for instance , both spatial components of the correlation function between two spins coupled by the heisenberg interaction can be obtained by differentiating the free energy with respect to the relevant spatial component ( @xmath63 or @xmath8 ) of the heisenberg interaction @xmath64\\ !",

[",
    "fig : corrl ] against temperature for the isotropic heisenberg interaction and two different values of the interaction ratio @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "two selected values of the interaction ratio @xmath69 has been chosen so as to achieve two different ground states . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the zero - temperature limits of the displayed correlation functions are consistent with a presence of the classical sa ground state in the former case with @xmath67 , while the existence of the more striking quantum sd ground state is evident in the latter case with @xmath70 .",
    "it is quite obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig : corrl](a ) that thermal fluctuations may induce quantum correlations above the classical sa ground state if the interaction ratio @xmath69 is selected sufficiently close to the ground - state boundary with the sd state .",
    "it actually turns out that the transverse pair correlation function @xmath71 becomes non - zero upon increasing temperature and the longitudinal pair correlation function @xmath72 changes its signal at some finite temperature @xmath73 called as the frustration temperature . following the definition by dos santos and lyra @xcite , the tetrahedral chain is frustrated above the frustration temperature as",
    "the product @xmath74 between three correlation functions along the triangular face of an elementary tetrahedron becomes negative .",
    "it is worthy of notice , moreover , that the correlation functions @xmath72 and @xmath75 remain negative for arbitrary temperature whenever the sd state constitutes the ground state .",
    "this result is taken to mean that the frustration persists for all temperatures if the sd state constitutes the ground state .",
    "another interesting aspect of the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain surely represents a study of thermal entanglement with regard to its unusual quantum ground states . for this purpose ,",
    "one may take advantage of the quantity referred to as the _ concurrence _",
    "@xcite , which may serve as a measure of the bipartite entanglement .",
    "the concurrence is defined in terms of the reduced density matrix @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath79 here , @xmath80 is the complex conjugate of the reduced density matrix @xmath76 and @xmath81 is being the relevant pauli matrix .",
    "it is quite well established that matrix elements of the reduced density operator can be expressed through the correlation functions @xcite and hence , the concurrence can be directly calculated from the correlation functions as evidenced by amico and co - workers @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the concurrence quantifying the bipartite entanglement between two spins coupled by the heisenberg interaction then follows from the relation @xmath82 which just involves two pair correlation functions given by eqs . and .",
    "it is noteworthy that an equivalent result could be obtained by employing the approach developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the concurrence is plotted against temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig : concrr](a ) for a specific choice of the antiferromagnetic ising and heisenberg interactions , which ensures occurrence of the classical sa spin alignment in the ground state .",
    "it surprisingly turns out that the ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain exhibits a weak thermal entanglement in spite of the classical sa ground state whenever a relative strength between the heisenberg and ising couplings is sufficiently close to the phase boundary @xmath83 with the other possible sd ground state ( @xmath84 if assuming the isotropic heisenberg interaction @xmath85 ) .",
    "accordingly , the concurrence shows a striking reentrant behavior when it becomes non - zero at a lower threshold temperature and disappears at an upper threshold temperature @xmath86 , whereas the lower threshold temperature gradually tends towards zero as the interaction ratio approaches the boundary value @xmath83 .",
    "it can be readily understood that the observed weak thermal entanglement comes from a temperature - induced strengthening of the transverse correlation function @xmath71 , whose effect is also supported by a relevant crossover of the longitudinal correlation function @xmath72 from the ferromagnetic regime to antiferromagnetic one after passing through the frustration temperature .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ fig : concrr](b ) displays more typical temperature variations of the concurrence on assumption that the interaction ratio between the heisenberg and ising interactions supports the sd ground state .",
    "the spins coupled by the heisenberg interaction are consequently maximally entangled at zero temperature and their quantum entanglement is gradually suppressed by thermal fluctuations .",
    "it appears worthwhile to remark that the threshold temperature above which the relevant spins become disentangled becomes higher as the magnitude of the ratio @xmath69 between the heisenberg and ising interactions increases .",
    "now , it might be quite interesting to compare the _ threshold _ temperature , delimiting the regimes of entangled spins ( finite concurrence ) and unentangled spins ( vanishing concurrence ) , with the _ frustration _ temperature that delimits the regimes with ( non frustrated ) and without ( frustrated ) a well defined spin configuration among the three spins forming a triangular face of an elementary tetrahedron .",
    "it is quite obvious from our previous analysis of the correlation functions that the absence of spin correlations can be directly connected with a disappearance of the longitudinal pair correlation function @xmath72 between two spins coupled by the heisenberg interaction . while the threshold temperature can be calculated from the condition @xmath87 by making use of eq .   for the concurrence ,",
    "the frustration temperature can be either calculated from the condition @xmath88 or the simpler equivalent condition @xmath89 after taking into account eq .   for the relevant correlation function .",
    "the frustration and threshold temperatures are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : frustration - t ] against the interaction ratio @xmath69 for three different values of the exchange anisotropy @xmath90 of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg interaction .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that the ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain is thermally entangled just in the parameter region below the line of threshold temperatures ( solid lines ) , which shows a relatively narrow reentrant behavior in a close vicinity of the ground - state boundary between the sd and sa ground states in agreement with our previous analysis of the concurrence . on the other hand ,",
    "the ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain is affected by a spin frustration only above the line of frustration temperatures ( broken lines ) , which also starts from the ground - state boundary between the sd and sa ground states but asymptotically tends towards infinity as @xmath91 .",
    "altogether , the frustration and threshold temperature remarkably coincide at sufficiently low temperatures , while they exhibit a very different behavior in the high - temperature region when tending towards completely different asymptotic limits .",
    "it is quite interesting to notice , moreover , that the thermally entangled region above the quantum sd ground state as well as the more peculiar thermally entangled region above the classical sa ground state fall into the frustrated region .",
    "hence , it could be concluded that the spin frustration seems to be an essential ingredient , which is needed in order to produce the thermal entanglement in the antiferromagnetic ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain .",
    "it is worthy to mention , moreover , that the relevant behavior of the ferromagnetic ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain has no special features at least for the isotropic case with @xmath92 , because the ground state is then always classical and there will be neither frustration nor threshold temperature .",
    "in addition , the other particular case with @xmath40 and @xmath93 shows a completely analogous behavior as the investigated antiferromagnetic tetrahedral chain with @xmath41 and @xmath94 due to the relevant symmetry of the interactions @xmath27 and @xmath8 ( see eq .  ) .",
    "last but not least , let us turn our attention to a discussion of typical temperature dependences of the specific heat numerically calculated from the free energy with the help of thermodynamic relation @xmath95 .",
    "[ fig : specific - heat](a ) displays typical thermal variations of the specific heat for the isotropic antiferromagnetic heisenberg coupling @xmath96 by choosing the interaction ratio @xmath69 close to and precisely at the ground - state boundary between the sa and sd ground states . under this condition",
    ", the specific heat generally exhibits the temperature dependence with a single round schottky - type maximum irrespective of a relative strength @xmath69 between both the interaction parameters , whereas there does not appear any additional low - temperature maximum that would reflect thermal excitations between the ground state and the respective low - lying excited state ( either from sa to sd state or vice versa ) .",
    "contrary to this , the more diverse temperature variations of the heat capacity can be observed by considering the more general case of the anisotropic heisenberg coupling ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : specific - heat](b ) ) .",
    "in addition to the standard thermal dependences of the specific heat with a single more or less symmetric round maximum , one may also detect a more pronounced double - peak temperature dependence as the exchange anisotropy strengthens ( i.e. @xmath97 ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that the ising - like exchange anisotropy drives the investigated spin system close to the ground - state boundary between two quantum sd and td ground states and thus , the additional low - temperature peak clearly reflects the low - lying thermal excitation from the sd ground state towards the excited td state .",
    "in this work , the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain has been exactly solved by employing its local gauge symmetry and the transfer - matrix technique .",
    "it is worthwhile to recall that the investigated spin system can be alternatively viewed as the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg two - leg ladder with equal ising interactions along the legs and diagonals , respectively .",
    "the elaborated rigorous procedure enabled us to obtain exact results for basic thermodynamic quantities ( e.g. free energy , specific heat ) and several pair correlation functions , which were subsequently used for a calculation of the concurrence quantifying the thermal entanglement between two spins coupled by the heisenberg interaction , the frustration and threshold temperature .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the frustration and threshold temperature coincide at low enough temperatures , while they tend towards completely different asymptotic limits in the high - temperature range .",
    "it actually turns out that the frustration temperature diverges as the interaction ratio @xmath91 , while the threshold temperature goes to infinity if @xmath98 . an interesting observation is that the investigated ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain is thermally entangled just in the frustrated region and hence , the frustration seems to be an essential ingredient in order to produce the quantum entanglement .",
    "it is worth noticing that the threshold temperature for the pairwise entanglement exhibits a striking reentrant behavior .",
    "therefore , it can emerge at moderate temperatures above the classical ground state without any quantum correlations .",
    "this feature unveils that the usual view point of thermal fluctuations as a mechanism through it quantum correlations are destroyed is not generally correct . in systems with an ordered classical ground state but close to a frustration point , thermal fluctuations",
    "can firstly destroy the magnetic local order , thus leaving space to the emergence of quantum entanglement at finite temperatures . only at sufficiently high temperatures ,",
    "the absence of quantum entanglement is recovered . besides",
    ", we have also investigated in particular typical temperature variations of the specific heat , which may exhibit a thermal dependence with ( without ) an anomalous low - temperature peak for a relatively strong ( weak ) heisenberg interaction .",
    "finally , it should be also mentioned that our rigorous procedure can be adapted in a rather straightforward way to account for the non - zero external magnetic field as well .",
    "our future work will continue in this direction .                                                                               ising - heisenberg tetrahedral chain .",
