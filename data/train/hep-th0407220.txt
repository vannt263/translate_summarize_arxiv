    "noncommutativity has been intensively studied in past years , in part due to its role in string theory ( @xcite and references therein ) and its application to condensed matter physics ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein )",
    ". it also offers interesting alternatives for gauge theories . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the development of noncommutative geometry  @xcite and the formality theorem in deformation quantization  @xcite , have been fundamental to the understanding of noncommutativity .",
    "the case of a constant noncommutativity parameter , which leads to the familiar moyal product , is well understood ( see , for example , @xcite ) . however , space - dependent noncommutativity is much more involved , since there is no general procedure to find an explicit representation for the resulting infinite - dimensional algebra , except when it comes from a poisson structure  @xcite .",
    "the whole physical picture corresponding to this situation is , consequently , not completely known , although a lot of progress has been made due to recent efforts .",
    "for example , the connection between curved d - branes and space - dependent noncommutativity has been established in  @xcite , and the construction of gauge theories in curved noncommutative spaces has been presented in  @xcite .",
    "see also refs.@xcite-@xcite .",
    "besides , an illuminating field - theory interpretation of kontsevich 's construction in terms of a sigma model has been provided in  @xcite .    the aim of this paper is to show how certain cases of coordinates satisfying a space - dependent commutation relation may be analyzed with the help of a change of variables .",
    "the main idea is that it may be possible to define new variables in terms of which one obtains a constant commutator . in terms of those coordinates",
    ", we can work with the usual moyal representation of the noncommutative product and then easily construct a calculus and study the geometry of the space .",
    "if the relevant objects ( product , derivatives , integrals ,  ) may at the end be written in terms of the original variables , we can obtain explicit representations for the original algebra , as well as for the derivatives and integrals .",
    "interestingly enough , cases in which this can be achieved are not artificial but arise in a variety of problems , for example related to the construction of noncommutative solitons and instantons @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : metric ] , we discuss the relation between the metric and a space - dependent commutation relation for the coordinates of a two - dimensional space , based on general considerations . in section  [ ssec : particular ] , we consider the particular case of a commutation relation that depends on only one of the coordinates . we show that , for this particular case , it is always possible to perform a change of variables to new coordinates verifying a constant ( i.e. , space - independent ) commutation relation so that the moyal product representation can be used with the resulting simplifications it implies .",
    "we then extend all the previous results to the example of a curved interface dividing two regions that have ( different ) constant values for @xmath0 in section  [ sec : interface ] , where we present the concrete example of a scalar field theory .",
    "the possibility of generalizing the method is discussed in section  [ sec : general ] . in section  [ sec : conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "coordinate commutators in a non - flat background spatial metric , necessarily imply the introduction of a coordinate - dependent noncommutativity parameter @xmath1 : @xmath2_\\star = i\\theta^{ij}(x ) \\;.\\ ] ] now , as it is well known , there are severe constraints that have to be satisfied for a consistent definition of a noncommutative associative @xmath3-product . in general , even when those constraints are satisfied , it is not possible to give a closed and explicit formula for the @xmath3-product between two arbitrary functions , as it can be done for the constant-@xmath0 case ( where one has the standard moyal product ) .",
    "the general conditions under which such a product can be defined are derived in  @xcite .    a sufficient condition to have an associative noncommutative product",
    "may be stated as follows  @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the covariant derivative corresponding to a metric connection .",
    "although up to this point we have not introduced any metric into the game , a natural one will appear precisely when solving ( [ suff ] ) in @xmath6 dimensions . that metric will be determined ( up to a constant scalar factor ) by @xmath7 itself",
    "; see ( [ conchap1 ] ) and ( [ conchap2 ] ) below .    condition ( [ suff ] ) may be derived by starting from the definition of the poisson bracket @xmath8 for two functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 : @xmath11 and then noting that a noncommutative product , up to order @xmath0 , takes the form   are presented in  @xcite . ] : @xmath12    the associativity of the @xmath3-product ( [ starr ] ) requires the jacobi identity for the poisson bracket ( [ pb ] ) to hold true , which in turns results in the equation : @xmath13 i.e. , @xmath1 is a poisson structure .",
    "in fact , this implies  @xcite that the product will be associative to all orders .",
    "the previous condition can be written covariantly in the form : @xmath14 since the terms in @xmath15 containing the ( symmetric ) connection cancel out .",
    "condition ( [ suff ] ) is a sufficient condition for ( [ eq : jacovar ] ) to be true , namely , for the associativity to be valid to all orders in @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , ( [ suff ] ) is very easy to deal with on a two dimensional space .",
    "indeed , the most general @xmath1 can be written in @xmath16 in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a scalar and @xmath19 is the determinant of the two dimensional metric @xmath20 .",
    "but then , condition ( [ suff ] ) reduces to @xmath21 and hence @xmath22 must be a constant .    then , the sufficient condition ( [ suff ] ) is equivalent , in @xmath16 , to the equation : @xmath23 where @xmath22 is a real ( non - vanishing ) constant .",
    "this expression relates the space - dependent associative noncommutativity to a non - trivial background metric @xmath24 .",
    "in fact , it is believed  @xcite that quantum gravity is at the origin of noncommutative effects , so that kind of relation is not entirely unexpected .",
    "the @xmath24 tensor can be explicitly written by taking into account that in @xmath6 dimensions every metric is conformally flat : @xmath25 and that the conformal factor @xmath26 is determined by @xmath27 : @xmath28    let us also note that , in the presence of a metric , the natural integration measure , @xmath29 , should be @xmath30 which is , as we shall see , consistent with the definition of a noncommutative product in which the integral acts as a trace .",
    "let us specialize the previous discussion in two dimensional space to the case in which @xmath0 depends on only one coordinate , @xmath32 say .",
    "we know that @xmath0 can then be written as follows : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a positive definite function .",
    "our aim is to present an explicit formula for a noncommutative associative @xmath3-product such that @xmath35 _ { \\star } \\;=\\ ;   x^1 \\star   x^2   - x^2 \\star   x^1   \\;=\\ ; i \\ , \\theta_0 \\ ,",
    "t(x^1 ) \\label{11 } \\;.\\ ] ] an expression for @xmath3 in powers of @xmath22 was already found by kontsevich @xcite , where the first terms are given by ( [ starr ] ) .",
    "however , the procedure to construct it , based on the formality theorem , can be quite involved in practice . rather than following that approach",
    ", we shall show how to arrive to an associative noncommutative product by a different path .",
    "inspired by the change of variables found in  @xcite , while studying noncommutative vortices in a curved space , we left and right multiply ( [ 11 ] ) by @xmath36 where the square root is the noncommutative one , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "then : @xmath38 here we have used the associativity of the @xmath3-product , which is valid for any positive function @xmath39 .",
    "we then change variables , from @xmath40 to new ones @xmath41 defined by : @xmath42 obtaining : @xmath43 note that ( [ tres ] ) involves the ( well - defined ) square root of a positive element , and besides , the definition of the new variables is not sensitive to the sign ambiguity of the square root , since that square root appears quadratically .",
    "also , the variables @xmath44 and @xmath45 , as defined in ( [ tres ] ) , are hermitian and , because of ( [ cuatro ] ) , the noncommutative @xmath3-product can then be realized as an ordinary moyal product .",
    "we shall use ` @xmath46 ' to denote the constant @xmath0 ( @xmath47 ) moyal product in terms of variables @xmath48 : @xmath49 for functions of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , working with the @xmath46-product , we can use all the standard ( flat - space ) noncommutative geometry tools @xcite .",
    "besides , we can rewrite the moyal formula in terms of the original variables , where it leads to a concrete expression for the @xmath3-product . to that end , we first note that from ( [ tres ] ) one has @xmath50 using ( [ eq : moyal1 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath51    where all the noncommutative artifacts have disappeared . then : @xmath52 is an ( exact ) expression for the change of variables , that will allow us to derive explicit expressions for @xmath3 and for the integration measure in the ` physical ' variables @xmath32 , @xmath53 .    as an example , consider the @xmath3-product between two functions of the original variables @xmath54 .",
    "it can be defined in the form @xmath55 it is easy to verify that ( [ cinco ] ) provides a consistent associative realization of the algebra ( [ 11 ] ) .    the first line in eq.([cinco ] ) may be applied to verify _ a posteriori _ the associativity of the @xmath3-product to all orders . indeed , that property is , in this light , simply _ inherited _ from the ( well - known ) associativity of the @xmath56 product : @xmath57 @xmath58    of course , since we have at our disposal the formula for the change of variables ( [ eq : changecoord ] ) , we may write everything in terms of @xmath32 and @xmath53 on the right hand side of eq.(22 ) .",
    "one has to take into account the formul @xmath59 using ( [ car ] ) , the @xmath3-product of functions of the original variables can be finally written , to all orders in @xmath22 , as @xmath60\\!f(x ) g(\\tilde x ) \\big \\vert _",
    "{ \\tilde x = x}\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by explicit computation order to order in @xmath22 one can verify the _ inherited _ associativity .",
    "for example , up to order @xmath61 , the product ( [ eq : moyal2 ] ) takes the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are partial derivatives with respect to @xmath32 and @xmath53 .",
    "one can explicitly verify that this formula satisfies associativity .",
    "note that kontsevich construction @xcite leads to equivalence classes ( one for each particular function @xmath0 ) of associative products .",
    "the product we have defined is not the representant chosen in @xcite where the procedure to change the representant is given .",
    "we are ready now to consider integrals of products of fields and derivatives , starting from the known expressions in terms of the new variables .",
    "taking into account that : @xmath65 and starting from an integral @xmath66 involving the @xmath56-product of two functions , we can write an equivalent expression in the new variables : @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "this expression guarantees that integrals of quadratic terms coincide with ordinary ones ( when fields satisfy appropriate boundary conditions ) . up to order @xmath69 this can be verified using eq.([eq : moyal3 ] ) .",
    "hence we see that also in this approach , the natural integration measure , in terms of variables @xmath40 is that given in ( [ dmu ] ) , @xmath70 this agrees with the result obtained in  @xcite , based on an operatorial description of noncommutativity .    let us end the previous discussion by noting that the machinery developed in this section is very helpful in the construction of solitons ( vortices and monopoles ) and instantons in noncommutative gauge theories .",
    "indeed , one can connect an axially symmetric ( in time @xmath71 ) ansatz for instantons in @xmath72-dimensional noncommutative yang - mills theory with noncommutative vortices in two dimensional curved space with variables @xmath73 .",
    "now , the metric in which this connection is realized takes the form @xmath74 .",
    "since it depends on just one variable , one can proceed , as explained above , to change variables in order to work with a standard moyal product . in this way , passing as usual to the fock space framework , explicit vortex , monopole and instanton solutions can be found in a very simple way  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "as an application ( and extension ) of the previous results , we shall study now the case in which @xmath75 is a function whose variation is concentrated along a curve @xmath76 , and is approximately constant elsewhere . in particular , we are interested in considering cases where @xmath0 has different ( constant ) values on two different regions which have @xmath77 as a common interface .    a simple , and yet non - trivial example of this situation corresponds to a @xmath78 with the following structure : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are two different real constants , and @xmath82 denotes the heaviside s step function , with integral representation @xmath83 the shape of the interface is determined by the function @xmath84 , which we assume to be smooth .",
    "the zeroes in the argument of @xmath82 correspond to @xmath85 which defines a smooth curve @xmath76 , dividing the plane into two regions with different values of @xmath0 , denoted @xmath80 and @xmath81 ; see figure  [ fig : single ] .",

    "we now proceed to change variables from the original coordinates @xmath40 to new ones @xmath94 which are defined by : @xmath95 so that the new variables verify the commutation relation : @xmath96_\\star \\;=\\ ; i \\,\\left (    \\theta_0 \\,+\\ , \\delta \\ , \\tanh(\\frac{q^1}{\\epsilon } ) \\right)\\;.\\ ] ] in what follows we shall assume that the constants @xmath80 and @xmath81 have the same sign ( positive , say ) , since the opposite situation , which necessarily involves a passage of @xmath0 through zero , is qualitatively different , as it will become clear below . with this in mind , we may write ( [ eq : commy ] ) in the form : @xmath97_\\star \\;=\\ ; i \\,\\theta_0 \\ ; t(q^1 ) \\;,\\ ] ] where : @xmath98    assuming that both @xmath80 and @xmath81 are positive , the function @xmath71 shall always be positive , and we are of course in the same situation we considered in  [ ssec : particular ] .",
    "based on those results , we introduce a second set of variables , @xmath99 , such that : @xmath100^{-1/2 } \\,\\star\\ ,   q^2 \\,\\star\\ , \\big [ t(q^1 ) \\big]^{-1/2 } \\ ; , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] which verify the constant-@xmath0 algebra @xmath101_\\star \\;=\\ ; i \\ ; \\theta_0 \\;,\\ ] ] with as the noncommutativity parameter .    then , in terms of the original variables , we have : @xmath102^{-1/2 } \\,\\star\\ , x^2 \\,\\star\\ , \\big[t(x^1-\\varphi(x^2 ) ) \\big]^{-1/2}\\;\\;\\;. \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    of course , by a similar procedure to the one explained in  [ ssec : particular ] , we may write everything in terms of the variables @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which have a much simpler commutation relation than the original coordinates @xmath32 and @xmath53 .",
    "the inverse transformation is easy to find , @xmath103 where all the products are commutative .",
    "therefore , we also have the direct transformation : @xmath104    an important tool in the construction of noncommutative field theories is the definition of derivatives .",
    "since we know two variables @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which verify a ` canonical ' ( i.e. , constant-@xmath0 ) commutation relation , it is natural to construct derivative operators in terms of them : @xmath105\\nonumber\\\\ d_2 & \\equiv & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^2}\\,=\\ ,   t(x^1 - \\varphi(x^2 ) ) \\ , \\big [ \\varphi'(x^2 ) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^1 } + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^2 } \\big ] \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can then obtain an explicit expression for the @xmath3-product between @xmath9 and @xmath27 : from ( [ cinco ] ) and ( [ eq : direct ] ) using the derivatives above defined , @xmath106 where : @xmath107 this expression shows explicitly how the interface enters in the star product",
    ".    it may be hard to attempt a direct proof of the fact that the operators defined in this way do satisfy leibniz rule ( with the star product ( [ eq : newstar ] ) ) .",

    "see , for example , @xcite for a discussion of inner derivations in a general setting .      one immediate outcome of ( [ eq : direct ] )",

    "we have at this stage the complete set of tools to define a noncommutative field theory . for a scalar field in euclidean time @xmath115 ,",
    "satisfying a reality condition which we will determine in a moment , we may define the action : @xmath116 \\;=\\ ; \\int\\frac{d\\tau dx^1 dx^2}{|t(x^1 - \\varphi(x^2))| } \\ , \\big[\\frac{1}{2}\\big ( \\partial_\\tau\\sigma \\star   \\partial_\\tau\\sigma + d_j \\sigma \\star d_j \\sigma + m^2 \\sigma \\star \\sigma \\big ) + v_\\star ( \\sigma ) \\big]\\ ] ] where the @xmath117 s ( @xmath118 ) have been defined in ( [ eq : defder ] ) , and the @xmath3-product is the one of ( [ eq : newstar ] ) .",

    "it becomes evident that a positive action requires @xmath123 to be a real function of @xmath124 ; then , noting that the transformation ( [ eq : direct ] ) is real , @xmath125 has to be real .",
    "working in terms of the variables @xmath48 provides another important simplification : from the moyal product ( [ eq : moyal1 ] ) , we see that @xmath126 then the quadratic part of the action coincides with its commutative counterpart .",
    "noncommutative effects appear in @xmath127 and , when we return to the original coordinates @xmath40 , they show up in the existence of nontrivial metric and derivatives .",
    "this procedure of ` pulling back ' the action to the coordinates @xmath119 may be used , for example , to derive the free propagator in terms of the ` physical ' coordinates @xmath128 .",
    "considering for simplicity the massless case , we see that : @xmath129^{-1/2}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this expression allows one to derive , in particular , the propagator for points on the interface .",

    "the result is different for pairs of arguments that are entirely inside each one of the two constant-@xmath0 regions .",

    "thus the presence of the interface introduces a fundamental change in the propagator , which never becomes equal to the free one , except for points on the interface .",
    "we have mentioned the difficulties that arise when @xmath0 vanishes ; indeed , it is clear now that this implies a singularity in the change of variables . assuming that @xmath81 and @xmath80 are such that @xmath0 vanishes on the interface , we know that @xmath71 will vanish ( with a non - zero normal derivative ) at the interface .",
    "one can , however , still define an action for the region where @xmath140 , say .",

    ". they satisfy leibniz rule and @xmath203      let us consider the special and important case of conformal transformations @xmath204 with @xmath27 an analytic function . applying eqs.([eq : rel1])-([eq : rel3 ] ) to our present situation , we see that @xmath27 must satisfy the condition @xmath205 this is of course much simpler than the general condition ( [ eq : condition1 ] ) , but it will only be useful to deal with some special cases .    for instance , we use this to study the rotation - invariant case @xmath206_\\star \\,=\\,i \\frac{\\theta_0}{2 } ( x_1 ^ 2 + x_2 ^2)\\;.\\ ] ] in the complex plane , @xmath207_\\star\\,=\\,\\theta_0 \\ , w \\bar w \\;.\\ ] ] from the condition ( [ eq : condition2 ] ) , @xmath208 has to satisfy @xmath209 this suggests to take @xmath210 where @xmath211 is a parameter with units of length and @xmath212 is a dimensionless constant . indeed , @xmath213 so , @xmath212 must satisfy @xmath214    according to ( [ eq : measure2 ] ) , the integrals will be of the form @xmath215 since @xmath216 the derivations are , using the chain rule , @xmath217    @xmath218    from @xmath219 and eqs.([eq : rel1])-([eq : rel3 ] ) , the fundamental @xmath3-products are @xmath220 ( no summation over repeated indices ) and @xmath221 for @xmath222 .",
    "it is worth noting that with this star product , @xmath223 is also rotation - invariant .",
    "we have shown how , in some special cases , planar noncommutative theories with a space - dependent @xmath0 can be equivalently described in terms of a constant @xmath0 , by performing a suitable change of variables . in this way",
    ", we have been able to find an explicit representation of the noncommutative product , and to deal with its associated calculus ( i.e. , derivatives and integration ) .",
    "we applied that procedure in section  [ sec : metric ] to the concrete example of a @xmath224 depending on only one coordinate .",
    "we have also unravelled the connection between space - dependent noncommutative parameter @xmath224 and associative noncommutativity in a non - trivial background metric @xmath24 .",
    "as explained at the end of this section , apart from its interest _ per se _ , this connection can be useful in the solution of selfduality noncommutative soliton equations which can be derived , one from the other if one introduces an appropriate background metric .",
    "the resulting @xmath3-product was later on ( section  [ sec : interface ] ) adapted to the example of a smooth interface @xmath225 dividing two regions with different constant @xmath0-values . the resulting noncommutative field theory obtained in this way",
    "could be used , for example , to study the physics of a reduced ( relativistic ) lowest landau level description , when the magnetic field is not homogeneous , but rather has two different constant values in two respective regions ( which have @xmath225 as a boundary ) .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : general ] , we sketched the extension of the change of variables to more general situations , by taking advantage of the holomorphic representation for planar systems .",
    "the simple and yet important case in which the redefinition of variables is realized by a conformal transformation , has been analyzed in  [ conformal ] , applying the results to the particular case of a rotation - invariant @xmath0 .",
    "a crucial point in the method is , of course , to find an adequate change of variables .",
    "this , in turn , depends on the explicit form of @xmath224 , in particular on its symmetries .",
    "that is the reason why it does not seem possible to construct an _",
    "explicit _ coordinate transformation to address the general case .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the present results can contribute to an understanding of the properties of theories with a space - dependent noncommutativity in a simpler way , by mapping them to systems equipped with the standard moyal product .",
