    "the ability to tailor the optical properties of a medium in such a way that it becomes transparent to a resonant laser field while its index of refraction is shaped at wish has been used for a wide range of applications , e.g. , from slow light @xcite and dark - state polariton physics @xcite to light - matter interfaces @xcite .",
    "these investigations are mainly motivated by the fast development of quantum information technologies and have been carried out in different types of media from atomic vapours , either cold @xcite or at room temperature @xcite , to solid state materials @xcite , photonic crystals @xcite and optical fibers @xcite .    for practical implementations it would be desirable to work at room temperature but",
    "often this implies the presence of inhomogeneous broadening that tends to reduce the transparency .",
    "explicitly , in hot atomic vapors , the atomic motion leads to doppler broadening due to the velocity - dependent shift of the laser field frequencies .",
    "if so , one direct approach to avoid inhomogeneous broadening consists of using cold atomic samples although it involves demanding technological requirements .",
    "in fact , albeit there are some proposals on how to reduce the negative role of the doppler broadening in a hot vapor @xcite , a fully satisfactory solution is still challenging . here",
    "we will focus on avoiding the adverse effects of the doppler broadening to obtain on - resonance transparency for two - level hot atomic vapours .",
    "however , our results could be extended to other inhomogeneously broadened systems , e.g. , solids with non - uniform crystalline fields @xcite .    in a two - level system",
    ", there exists a simple approach for achieving doppler - free transparency named _ self - induced transparency _ ( sit ) @xcite , which consists in shaping a resonant optical pulse propagating in the medium such that an integer number of rabi oscillations is performed .",
    "this occurs in the coherent regime whenever the pulse area is an integer multiple of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , sit requires a very precise temporal control of the rabi frequency .",
    "analogously to sit , when the pulse area is a multiple of an odd number of @xmath2 , self - induced absorption ( sia ) occurs .",
    "an alternative approach to achieve resonant transparency consists in using induced atomic coherences in three- or multi - level atomic systems , e.g. , by means of the coherent population trapping ( cpt ) @xcite and the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite phenomena or via a double - stirap process @xcite . in most cases , an intense laser field , the so - called control field , couples to an atomic transition while modifying the optical properties of the medium for a weak laser field , the probe , acting on an adjacent transition .",
    "however , the fact that all these atomic coherence effects , cpt , eit , stirap and double - stirap , operate in the so - called two - photon ( or raman ) resonance condition means that , in the presence of doppler broadening , the two laser fields must have near identical frequencies which severely restricts the range of applications of atomic coherence effects in hot atomic vapors @xcite .    in this paper , we present a novel approach that gives rise to doppler - free transparency in a two - level ( 2l ) system resembling a double - stirap process in a three - level ( 3l ) system . to achieve self - transparency",
    "we will appropriately modify in time the amplitude and detuning of the laser pulse .",
    "it will be shown that this technique , which we name _ adiabatic self - induced transparency _ ( asit ) , operates for a larger parameter range than sit and is much more robust against fluctuations of the parameter values .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] the nature of the asit phenomenon is described in the framework of the topological equivalence between density matrix equations for a 2l system and the schrdinger equation for a 3l system . in section [ asit ] ,",
    "the time evolution of the 2l system under conditions for asit is studied in the inhomogeneously ( doppler ) broadened case .",
    "section [ sit - asit ] is devoted to the comparison between the proposed asit process and the already known sit phenomenon .",

    "we note that the temporal variation of the field amplitude and the detuning can be accomplished for instance by chirped pulses , and that chirped pulse excitation to achieve population inversion in a 2l system has been discussed via stark chirped raman adiabatic passage ( scrap ) @xcite .",
    "such analogy between stirap and chirped two - state excitation has been studied in @xcite in the complete coherent case , e.g. , without spontaneous emission , and in the absence of doppler broadening .",
    "from that study it follows that for the 2l - stirap case the bloch vector moves from the south pole ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) to the equator ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath38 ) [ see fig .",

    "a functional definition of transparency is that the two - level atom evolves coherently from @xmath43 ( population in the lower level ) back to @xmath44",
    ". this coherent evolution should be fast enough such that spontaneous emission becomes negligible , which in turn , means that there is not irreversible em absorption .",

    "as it has been mentioned above , a well known method to obtain transparency in a 2l system is the sit phenomenon @xcite , i.e. , coherent induced absorption of pulse energy during the first half of the pulse followed by coherent induced emission of the same amount of energy back into the beam direction during the second half of the pulse . in this case",

    ", the spontaneous decay rate of the excited state does not play any role either in the stirap or in the double - stirap processes , because the whole adiabatic process occurs without coupling the excited state .",

    "[ f6v4](a ) ) and @xmath141 ( fig .",
    "[ f6v4](b ) ) .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ f6v4 ] that nonadiabatic effects are negligible for pulses with large area and short time duration .",
    "in contrast they are pronounced for long pulses and also for short pulses with small area , when the amplitude @xmath91 of the d pulse becomes comparable to the doppler width of the transition . by taking into account",
    "that at room temperature ( @xmath142 ) , the doppler width is equal to @xmath143 we can conclude , [ see fig . [ f6v4](a ) ] , that the reported phenomenon of asit can be feasible experimentally in an atomic vapour cell of rubidium at room temperature and under excitation of nanosecond em and d pulses with pulse area of few @xmath2 .     under conditions of asit in the plane @xmath144 for a doppler broadened 2l system of @xmath145 atoms excited by em and d pulses of equal areas for two values of the time duration @xmath140 ( a ) and @xmath146 ( b ) .",
    "the considered transition of the @xmath145 atoms is @xmath137 @xmath138 @xmath139 with @xmath147 nm , @xmath148 @xmath149 and @xmath110 . ]    in conclusion , we have demonstrated the feasibility of the adiabatic self induced transparency ( asit ) technique , which yields doppler - free transparency for electromagnetic pulses in a 2l system .",
    "our technique consists of driving the 2l system with a laser pulse whose detuning with respect to the atomic transition and whose em field amplitude are temporally varied in a proper shape .",
    "the detuning modulation can be introduced either by using the stark or the zeeman effect to obtain time - dependent energy levels in the atom / molecule , which gives rise to time - dependent detunings , or alternatively by introducing a suitable chirp on the em pulse .",
    "we have studied the robustness of the reported phenomena against modifications of the pulse parameters and we have shown that the asit process is much more robust than the conventional sit , in the sense that the area of the pulses needs not to be adjusted with precision and it can be much less sensitive to doppler broadening . because of the adiabaticity condition , the pulse areas for asit need in general to be somewhat larger than for sit , for which a @xmath51 area is sufficient , but it could be implemented with no essential difficulty in real doppler - broadened atomic systems such as for instance rubidium hot vapors . although the results presented in this article have been obtained for gaussian pulses we have also checked the validity of the asit technique for pulses with other forms of temporal profiles .",
