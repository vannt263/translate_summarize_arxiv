    "we need an encoding technique to restore errors on the quantum state by decoherence , namely the error correcting code .",
    "it has been pointed out that error correction of the quantum state has a deep connection with spin glass models and lattice gauge theories in finite dimensions .",

    "recently it has been shown that a more useful quantum error correcting code , the topological color code , also has a connection with the spin glasses @xcite .",
    "these fascinating bridges between the spin glasses and the quantum error correcting codes are established in a special subspace in spin glasses .",
    "this subspace is known as the nishimori line which goes through the phase boundary between the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] @xcite .",
    "the ferromagnetic phase on the nishimori line represents the region where errors on the quantum state can be restored , and vice versa .",

    "the phase boundary under the nishimori line is believed to be vertical by the argument of the gauge transformation @xcite.,width=226 ]    there are little exact and rigorous approaches for spin glasses in finite dimensions .",
    "one of the powerful theoretical techniques is the gauge symmetry on the nishimori line . on this line",
    ", we can calculate the exact value of the internal energy , evaluate the upper bound for the specific heat , and obtain some sets of rigorous and exact inequalities by the gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "in addition , the analytical theory estimating the precise location of the multicritical point has been established by a technique with the duality and the replica method @xcite . in the present study ,",

    "the hamiltonian of the three - body ising model on the triangular lattice is @xmath10where the summation is taken over all the triangles ( both of up - pointing and down - pointing triangles ) , and @xmath11 is the ising spin variable taking @xmath12 on sites as in fig .",
    "this model is known as a self - dual model @xcite , and has a single transition point @xmath13 which is the same as the ordinary two - body ising model on the square lattice @xcite .",

    "two principal boltzmann factors are important pieces of information and given as @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , similarly to the case for the random bond ising model on the square lattice @xcite .",

    "it is given as the fixed point of the duality and is known to yield the exact critical point for a simple ferromagnetic system as reviewed in the previous section . in order to obtain the multicritical point of the present replicated spin glass system , we set @xmath67 , which defines the nishimori line on which the multicritical point is expected to lie . since @xmath68 is a multivariable function , there is no fixed point of the duality relation in the strict sense which satisfies @xmath53 conditions simultaneously , @xmath69 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the non - random case , in which the duality is a relation between single - variable functions .",

    "this consequence would not be correct , since two color codes have different computational capabilities @xcite .",
    "for the topological color code on the square - octagonal lattice , it is possible to implement the whole clifford group of unitary gates generated by the hadamard gate , the @xmath75 gate , and the controlled - not gate ; while , for that on the hexagonal lattice , the @xmath75 gate can not be implemented . in spin glasses ,",
    "the quenched randomness yields frustration depending on geometry of lattices , and the locations of the multicritical points in quenched random systems are thus different in general .",
    "in addition , the symmetry ( e.g. , spin - reversal ) is quite different between two - body and three - body ising models , while the above estimation is also given for the case of the two - body @xmath76 ising model on the self - dual lattices @xcite .",

    "it is , however , very difficult to obtain a precise value of the location of the multicritical point , that is the accuracy threshold , by numerical approaches because of the necessity of very long time for the equilibration and statistical error for the average of the quenched randomness . in the following section , instead of the numerical approach",

    "we thus predict that the location of the multicritical point for the union - jack lattice would be @xmath115 from the results by @xmath113 and @xmath114 clusters , or equivalently the accuracy threshold for the color code on the square - octagonal lattice is @xmath116 .",
