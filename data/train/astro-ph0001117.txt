    "data from iras ( the infra - red astronomical satellite ) allows unparalleled uniformity , sky coverage and depth for mapping the local galaxy density field . in 1992 , with completion of the qdot and 1.2 jy surveys ( rowan - robinson 1990a , lawrence 1999 , strauss 1990 , 1992 , fisher 1995 ) , and with other large redshift surveys in progress , it became clear that a complete redshift survey of the iras point source catalog ( the psc , beichman 1984 , henceforth es ) had become feasible .",
    "our specific targets for the pscz survey were two - fold : ( a ) we wanted to maximise sky coverage in order to predict the gravity field , and ( b ) we wanted to obtain the best possible completeness and flux uniformity within well - defined area and redshift ranges , for statistical studies of the iras galaxy population and its distribution .",
    "the availability of digitised optical information allowed us to relax the iras selection criteria used in the qigc ( rowan - robinson 1990b ) , and use optical identification as an essential part of the selection process .",
    "this allowed greater sky coverage , being essentially limited only by requiring that optical extinctions be small enough to allow complete identifications .",
    "the psc was used as starting material , because of its superior sky coverage and treatment of confused and extended sources as compared with the faint source survey ( moshir 1989 ) .",
    "the depth of the survey ( @xmath2 ) derives from the depth to which the psc is complete over most of the sky .",
    "the topology of the survey is analysed and presented by canavezes ( 1998 ) ; the inferred velocity field by branchini ( 1999 ) ; the real - space power spectrum and its distortion in redshift - space by tadros ( 1999 ) ; the redshift - space power spectrum by sutherland ( 1999 ) .",
    "the direction and convergeance of the dipole has been investigated by rowan - robinson ( 1999 ) , and its implications for cosmological models by schmoldt ( 1999 ) .",
    "sharpe ( 1999 ) presented a least - action reconstruction of the local velocity field , while an optical / iras clustering comparison was presented by seaborne ( 1999 ) .",
    "many of these results are summarised in saunders ( 1999 ) .",
    "we aimed to include in the survey all areas of sky with ( a ) reliable and complete iras data , and ( b ) optical extinction small enough to allow reliable galaxy identifications and spectroscopic followup .",
    "we defined a mask of those parts of the sky excluded from the survey ; the final mask was the union of the following areas :    1 .",
    "areas failing to get 2 hours - confirming coverages ( hcons , es iii.c.1 ) . in these areas",
    ", there is either no data at all or the data does not allow adequate source confirmation .",
    "2 .   areas flagged as high source density at @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "hsd at @xmath3 or @xmath4 implies an impossibly high stellar density for galaxy identifications .",
    "areas flagged as hsd at @xmath5 were processed differently in the psc , with completeness sacrificed for the sake of reliability .",
    "3 .   areas with @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath7 intensity values are those of rowan - robinson ( 1991 ) . above this value",
    ", we found the fraction of sources which were identifiable as galaxies dropped dramatically .",
    "areas with extinctions @xmath8 , where secure optical identifications become increasingly difficult .",
    "our extinction estimates were based on the @xmath9 values above , and incorporated a simple model for the the variation in dust temperature across the galaxy ; they are discussed further in section 4.3 . except towards the centre and anti - centre ,",
    "this criterion and the previous one are almost equivalent 5 .",
    "small patches covering the lmc and smc , defined by @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively . in these areas , there are large numbers of hii regions in the clouds themselves with similar optical and iras properties to background galaxies , making identifications very uncertain .    the mask is specified as a list of excluded @xmath12 ` lune - bins ' ( es ap.x.1 ) , so these values are necessary averages over @xmath13 .",
    "the overall area outside the mask is 84% of the sky . for statistical studies of the iras galaxy population and its distribution , where uniformity is more important than sky coverage",
    ", we made a ` high @xmath14 ' mask , as above but including all areas with @xmath15 , and leaving 72% of the sky . in practice , this criterion is almost identical to @xmath16 .",
    "henceforth , when we say ` high - latitude ' , we simply mean outside this mask . both masks are shown in figure 1 .",
    "our aim was to relax the criteria of the qigc sufficiently to pick up virtually all galaxies , even at low latitude , purely from their iras properties ; simultaneously , we wanted to keep contamination by galactic sources to a reasonable level .",
    "our actual colour selection criteria were almost the same as the qigc :    [ cols=\"<,^ , > \" , ]     however , unlike the qigc , upper limits were used only where they guaranteed inclusion or exclusion .",
    "we did not at this stage exclude any source solely on the basis of an identification with a galactic source . because the pscz evolved from the qigc ,",
    "there remain in the catalogue 3 galaxies which actually fail the new selection criteria . in total , we selected 16422 sources from the psc .",
    "many very nearby galaxies have multiple psc sources , associated with individual starforming regions .",
    "70 such sources were pruned to leave for each such galaxy , the single , brightest psc source . also at this stage , local group galaxies were excised from the catalogue , and a separate catalogue of far - infrared properties for local group galaxies made .",
    "all iras surveys are bedevilled by the question of how to deal with galaxies which are multiple or extended with respect to the iras @xmath5 beam .",
    "the size of most @xmath5 detectors was @xmath17 in - scan by @xmath18 cross - scan .",
    "the raw data was taken every @xmath19 , and for the psc this was then filtered with an 8-point zero - sum linear filter , of the form @xmath20 . hence galaxies with in - scan far - infrared sizes larger than about @xmath17 , will have their fluxes underestimated in the psc .",
    "there is a lesser sensitivity to cross - scan diameter , caused by some of the scans only partially crossing the full width exteneded sources .",
    "the approach we have settled on is to preferentially use psc fluxes , except for sources identified with individual galaxies whose large diameters are likely to lead to significant flux underestimation in the psc .",
    "the psc flux is based on a least chi - squared template fit to the point - source - filtered data - stream , so the flux is correctly measured for slightly extended sources , with diameters smaller than about @xmath17 .",
    "as far - infrared diameters are typically half optical , ( e.g. rice 1988 ) , and optical @xmath21 diameters are typically several times the fwhm for spirals , we can expect that isolated galaxies must have extinction - corrected diameters larger than several arcmin for their fluxes to be badly underestimated by the psc .",
    "fluxes for extended sources can be derived using the addscan ( or scanpi ) software provided at ipac , which coadds all detector scans passing over a given position .",
    "we have tested how the ratio of psc - to - extended flux depends on @xmath21 , and , as expected , we find that the ratio is almost constant for galaxies up to @xmath22 ( figure 2 ) , where the addscan flux is typically 10% larger . however , we also find that addscan fluxes are systematically 5% larger than psc fluxes , even for much smaller galaxies .",
    "this discrepancy is not due to any difference in calibration ( we have tested this by extracting a point - source - filtered flux from the addscan data and substituting this for the psc flux , but the discrepancy in figure 2 remains ) . the reason is the large number of multiple and/or interacting galaxies seen by iras , for which the addscan picks up the entire combined flux .",
    "using such combined fluxes throughout is not a consistent approach , since nearby interacting galaxies will always be resolved into two or more sources , while more distant ones will not be .",
    "the effect of the psc filter is more subtle : a close pair of galaxies unresolved by the iras beam will in general have unequal fluxes , and in a flux limited survey , at least one will be below the flux limit .",
    "in such a situation , the zero - sum linear psc filter still overestimates the flux of the brightest source on average ( because of clustering ) , but by much less than the addscan .",
    "very large galaxies will have fluxes underestimated by the addscan , because their cross - scan extent is large compared with the detector size .",
    "fluxes for galaxies with optical diameters @xmath23 have been taken from rice ( 1988 ) , who made coadded maps for each such galaxy . in principal ,",
    "galaxies somewhat smaller than this may have underestimated fluxes from the addscans .",
    "however , we find that , for the 19 pscz galaxies in rice with quoted diameters @xmath24 , the flux differance between addscan and rice fluxes is @xmath25 , that is the addscan fluxes are slightly but not significantly larger ; so we do not expect smaller galaxies to have underestimated addscan fluxes .",
    "bearing these points in mind , we proceeded as follows : we made a catalogue , with the same sky coverage as the pscz , of optically - selected galaxies from the leda database ( paturel 1989 ) with extinction - corrected @xmath21 diameters larger than @xmath26 , where the extinctions were estimated as per section 4.3 , and the consequent corrections to the diameters are as given by cameron ( 1990 ) . in saunders ( 1995 ) , it was argued that leda is reasonably complete to this limit .",
    "for the largest sources , we used the positions and fluxes of rice ( 1988 ) .",
    "ipac kindly addscanned all the remainder for us to provide coadded data .",
    "we then used software supplied by amos yahil to extract positions , fluxes and diameters from this data , on the assumption that the galaxies have exponential profiles . where these addscan fluxes are used in the catalogue ,",
    "they have been arbitrarily decreased by 10% , to bring them statistically into line with the psc fluxes at the @xmath26 switchover .",
    "we ended up with 1402 sources associated with large galaxies entering the catalogue , and 1290 psc sources associated with large galaxies flagged for deletion .",
    "the latter are kept in the catalogue , so that a purely iras - derived catalogue can be extracted if wanted .      in the qigc",
    ", sources flagged as associated with confirmed extended sources , or with poor correlation coefficient , or flagged as confused , were addscanned .",
    "the above prescription should have dealt with the extended sources ; the only other reasons for a galaxy source to have a poor cc are that ( a ) it is multiple , and as argued above we prefered psc fluxes in these cases , or ( b ) it has low s / n , in which case the psc is an unbiased flux estimator , while addscanning risks noise - dependent biases .",
    "the confusion flag is set very conservatively ( i.e. most sources flagged as confused have sensible psc fluxes ) and in any case the psc in general deals better with confusion than the addscans , in both cross - scan and in - scan directions .",
    "for these reasons , and to avoid introducing any latitude - dependent biases into the catalogue , we opted to use psc fluxes throughout for sources not identified with optical galaxies as above .",
    "addscan fluxes are included in the catalogue for all sources for those wishing to experiment with them .      for a source to be accepted into the psc",
    ", it required successful hours - confirmation on two separate hcons ( es v.d.6 ) . thus at low s / n , areas of the sky with only 2 hcons are inevitably less complete than those with 3 or more ; the estimated completeness at @xmath27 in 2hcon areas is only 82% ( es xii.a.4 ) . to improve this completeness ,",
    "we supplemented the catalogue with 1hcon sources satisfying our colour criteria in the point source catalog reject file ( es vii.e.1 ) , where there is a corresponding source in the faint source survey .",
    "we demanded that psc and fss sources be within each other s @xmath28 error ellipse , and that the fluxes agree to within a factor of @xmath29 .",
    "this revealed many sources in the reject file where two individual hcon detections had failed to be merged in the psc processing ( es xii.a.3 ) , as well as sources which failed at least one hcon for whatever reason .",
    "new sources were created or merged with existing ones , and the flux overestimation parameters ( es xii.a.1 ) assigned or recalculated accordingly . as well as these 1hcon sources , we also searched in the reject file for additional sources with flux quality flags 1122 and 1121 ; neither of which category made the psc .",
    "finally , we looked for sources in the psc itself with flux quality flags 1113 , but correlation coefficient at @xmath5 equal to a , b or c indicating a meaningful detection .",
    "altogether we found an additional 323 galaxies , mostly in 2hcon regions , and made 143 deletions as a result of merging individual hcon detections .      optical material for",
    "virtually all sources was obtained from cosmos or apm scans , including new apm scans taken of 150 low - latitude poss - i e plates . in general , we used red plates at @xmath30 and blue otherwise .",
    "the actual categories of optical material are : + 1 . uncalibrated poss - o plates scanned with apm . here",
    "the magnitudes are typically good to @xmath31 for faint ( @xmath32 ) galaxies .",
    "src j plates scanned with apm .",
    "these plates were scanned and matched for the apm survey , and have @xmath33 magnitudes typically good to @xmath34 for faint galaxies .",
    "uncalibrated src j or ej plates scanned with cosmos , giving @xmath33 accurate to about @xmath31 .",
    "src sr plates scanned with cosmos .",
    "the quoted magnitudes are r - magnitudes , good to @xmath31 .",
    "poss - e plates scanned with apm . for these plates , the standard poss - o calibration was assumed .",
    "since the o plates are about 1 magnitude deeper than the e plates , while @xmath35 for iras galaxies , this gives a reasonable approximation to the @xmath36 magnitude .",
    "when there is extinction , this procedure gives systematically too bright a magnitude by about @xmath37 ( assuming mathis 1990 ) .",
    "the scatter is still dominated by the @xmath31 zero - point error .    at bright magnitudes , photographic photometry for galaxies",
    "becomes increasingly uncertain because of non - linearity and saturation in the emulsion .",
    "the image parameters from cosmos and apm data were also used to get arcsecond positions and offsets from nearby stars , and to make ` cartoon ' representations of the @xmath38 field centred on each iras source .",
    "the identifications were made using the likelihood methods of sutherland and saunders ( 1992 ) . in general , and always at low latitudes , these cartoons were supplemented by grayscale images from the digital sky survey and/or inspection of copy plates , and any change in best identification noted .    at this stage ,",
    "non - galaxies were weeded out by a combination of optical appearance , iras colours and addscan profiles , vla 20 cm maps from the nvss survey ( condon 1998 ) , millimetre data from wouterlout and brand ( 1989 ) , simbad and other literature data .",
    "several hundred low - latitude sources were also imaged at @xmath39 , as part of the extension of the pscz to lower latitudes ( saunders 1999 ) .",
    "we found a total of 1376 confirmed non - galaxies .",
    "we are left with 15332 confirmed galaxies , and a further 79 sources where no optical identification is known but there is no clear galactic identification either .",
    "the distribution of identified galaxies and the mask are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the galactic sources are dominated by infrared cirrus ( 774 sources )",
    ". however , there are also 88 planetary nebulae , 140 emission - line stars , 24 sources identified with galactic hii regions , 212 sources identified with bright stars or reflection nebulae , and 138 sources associated with yso s .",
    "an essential part of the project was maintenance of a large database of redshift information from the literature , from databases such as the ned and leda ( the nasa and lyons extragalactic databases ) and huchra s zcat , and also work in progress for other surveys .",
    "redshifts were accepted on the basis that their claimed error was better than any other available for that source , including our own .    of the 15,411 galaxies in the sample ,",
    "about 8,000 had known redshift at the inception of the project , with about another 2,000 expected to be observed as part of ongoing projects such as the cfa2 and ssrs surveys .",
    "the project was fortunate enough to be allocated 6 weeks of int+fos time , 1 week int+ids , 6 nights aat+fors time , 18 nights on the ctio 1.5 m , two weeks at the inaoe 2.1 m and 120 hours at nanay radiotelescope , over a total of 4 years .",
    "4600 redshifts were obtained in this time . for the int+ids and ctio spectra ,",
    "redshift determination was made from the average observed wavelengths of the , nii and sii features .",
    "the rest of the data was taken with low dispersion spectrographs with resolutions around 15 - 20 angstroms , and the /nii lines are blended together , as are the two sii lines .",
    "we modelled each continuum - subracted spectrum as a linear combination of , nii and sii features , with redshift as a free parameter .",
    "the model giving the smallest @xmath40 versus the data gave the redshift and its error , also the various linestrengths and a goodness of fit .",
    "spectra with poor @xmath40 , large redshift uncertainty or unphysical line ratios were checked by hand and where necessary refitted with different fwhm or initial guesses .",
    "wavelength calibration included cross - correlation of each sky spectrum with a well calibrated template .",
    "the final derived errors average @xmath41 , as compared with @xmath42 for the qdot survey .",
    "further details are presented in keeble ( 1996 ) , and oliver ( 1999 ) .    by construction",
    ", we have minimised the overlap with other redshift surveys , but there are to date 448 galaxies for which we have both our own measurement , and higher resolution measurements by other workers ( figure 3 ) .",
    "there are 31 sources where the velocity difference is more than @xmath43 ( errors combined in quadrature ) , if these are clipped out , the remaining 417 sources give an average offset @xmath44 , with a scatter of @xmath45 and a reduced @xmath46 .",
    "the scatter includes the contribution from the non - pscz redshift , and suggests that our quoted errors are good estimates of the genuine external error .",
    "of the 31 discrepant redshifts , 5 involve hi observations with unrealistically small quoted errors and with absolute differences less than @xmath47 , a further 11 are between 100 and 600 @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and suggest a non - gaussian error distribution , and 15 are greater than @xmath50 and @xmath51 and must represent different galaxies or incorrect line identification or calibration .",
    "we thus have 15 redshifts seriously in error out of a total of 896 recent measurements ( both ours and other workers ) giving an error rate of 1.7% .",
    "we did not pursue very faint ( @xmath52 ) galaxies , on the basis that ( a ) they were certain to be at distances too large to be included for either statistical or dynamical studies , and ( b ) very large amounts of telescope time would be needed to achieve useful completeness for these galaxies .",
    "there are 438 sources without known redshift with a clear or probable faint optical galaxy identification ( with @xmath52 ) , and a further 127 with no obvious optical identification but no secure identification as a galactic source either . at time of writing",
    "we are still lacking redshifts for 189 brighter ( @xmath53 ) galaxies .",
    "the sky distribution of these categories is shown in figure 4 .",
    "redshifts are available for 14677 sources .",
    "the @xmath54 distribution is shown in figure 5 .",
    "the source density amounts to 1460 gals @xmath55 at high latitudes and the median redshift is @xmath56 . to account for the effect of the flux limit on the observed number density of galaxies as a function of distance , we need to know the _ selection function _",
    "@xmath57 , here defined as the expected number density of galaxies in the survey as a function of distance in the absence of clustering .",
    "we have derived this both non - parametrically and parametrically using the methods of mann , saunders and taylor ( 1996 ) .",
    "this method is almost completely insensitive to the assumed cosmology , in the sense that the derived expected @xmath54 is invariant .",
    "the resulting selection function can be transformed to other cosmologies or definitions of distance simply by mapping the volume element or distance , keeping @xmath58 invariant .    for simplicity , and to allow comparison with simulations , we assume for derivation purposes a euclidean universe without relativistic effects , and with distance @xmath59 equal to @xmath60 .",
    "we derive the result both non - parametrically , and parametrically using the double power - law form    \\(r ) = _ * @xmath61 ^ 1- @xmath62 ^ - @xmath63    which very well describes the non - parametric results .",
    "the parameters @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively describe the normalisation , the nearby slope , the break distance in @xmath69 , its sharpness and the additional slope beyond it .",
    "using the high - latitude pscz to derive the selection function , and correcting redshifts only for our motion with respect to the centroid of the local group , @xmath70 , we obtain    @xmath71    both non - parametric and parametric results are shown in figure 6 . the uncertainty in the selection function is less than 5% for distances @xmath72 , and 10% for @xmath73 , although the selection function drops by 4 decades over this range .    in figure 6",
    ", we also show the non - parametric selection function derived by the same method , for the qdot and @xmath74 surveys .",
    "the utility of the pscz for cosmological investigation depends on its reliability , completeness and uniformity .",
    "the major sources of unreliability in the catalogue are ( a ) incorrect identifications with galaxies nearby in angular position , and ( b ) incorrect identification of spectral features .",
    "later cross - referencing used increasingly sophisticated methods based on sutherland and saunders ( 1992 ) , but many older identifications depend on simple @xmath75 proximity .",
    "the most recent cross - correlation with zcat provided 1975 updated velocities , of which 84 were altered by more than @xmath76 and 50 by more than @xmath77 , suggesting an error rate of 2% , in agreement with the analysis of section 3 .",
    "the identifications made for our own redshift followup were done much more carefully than those taken from the literature , using a likelihood approach including full knowledge of the error ellipse , optical galaxy source counts etc , and checked by eye from a greyscale image .",
    "the number of ambiguous identifications is negligible , though the psc source is often confused between two galaxies separated by a few arcmin in the cross - scan direction .",
    "where there was real ambiguity , we took redshifts for both galaxies and used the one with larger flux .",
    "it is also possible that galactic sources were occasionally identified as background galaxies , but we believe this to be very rare .",
    "incompleteness enters into the catalogue for many reasons :    \\1 ) there will be iras incompleteness where sources with true @xmath5 flux greater than @xmath2 fail to appear in the catalogue .",
    "the largest source of this incompleteness is the areas of sky with only 2hcons , where the psc incompleteness is estimated as 20% ( differential ) and 5% ( cumulative ) at @xmath2 ( es xii.a.4 ) .",
    "based on source counts , we estimate that our recovery procedure ( section 2.5 ) for these sources has reduced the overall incompleteness in these areas from 5% to 1.5% ; figure 7 shows the source counts for high - latitude 2hcon sky .",
    "our recovery procedure was impossible for @xmath30 , so lower - latitude 2hcon sky ( 2% of the catalogue area ) retains the psc incompleteness .",
    "\\2 ) the psc is confusion limited in the plane .",
    "however , by construction , the pscz does not cover any areas with high source density at @xmath5 ( as defined in es v.h.6 ) , and the mask defined at @xmath7 effectively limits the number of confusing sources .",
    "also , at low latitudes , there are known problems in the psc with noise lagging .",
    "however , the source counts shown in figure 8 show low - latitude incompleteness to be small down to @xmath2 .",
    "\\3 ) some galaxies are excluded by our colour criteria .",
    "cool , nearby galaxies may fail the @xmath78 condition , but will normally be included separately as extended sources . from the comparison with the @xmath74 survey , we estimate that about 50 galaxies from the psc have been excluded ( see section 5 ) .",
    "\\4 ) no attempt was made to systematically obtain redshifts for galaxies with @xmath52 . at high latitudes",
    ", the work of e.g. clements ( 1996 ) shows that these will in general be further than @xmath79 . at lower latitudes , incompleteness cuts in at lower redshifts .",
    "it was originally hoped that the pscz would be everywhere complete to @xmath80 , but it is clear from the 3d density distributions that there is significant ( 10% or more ) incompleteness down to z=0.04 towards the anti - centre . the reasons for this are discussed in the next subsection .",
    "patchy extinction can lead to higher local extinction than our values , which are averages over @xmath13 bins .",
    "we have obtained @xmath39 images of most low - latitude sources without obvious galaxy or galactic identification ; many faint galaxies are revealed , but only a handful of nearby ones .",
    "spectroscopy of the missing low - latitude galaxies is continuing as part of the behind the plane extension to the pscz survey ; for the time being , we estimate that good completeness has been achieved for @xmath81 .",
    "the incompleteness is strongly concentrated towards the anticentre and at low latitudes ; for @xmath82 , the survey is estimated to be useably complete to @xmath80 everywhere .",
    "the number of galaxies with @xmath53 for which redshifts are still unknown is 192 , or 1.2% of the sample . a further 85 have only marginal redshift determinations and some of these will be incorrect .",
    "both unknown and marginal redshifts are well distributed round the sky , but with some preference for lower latitudes .",
    "our extinction maps started from the @xmath9 intensity maps of rowan - robinson ( 1991 ) , binned into lune bins , with the @xmath83 ratio as given by boulanger and perault ( 1988 ) , and @xmath84 ratio as given by mathis ( 1990 ) . because the dust temperature declines with galactic radius , this procedure over - estimates extinctions towards the galactic centre , and under - estimates them towards the anti - centre .",
    "we attempted to correct for this dependence of dust temperature on position by devising a simple model for the dust and starlight in our galaxy .",
    "we assumed a doubly exponential , optically thin distribution of dust and stars , with standard iau scalelengths for the solar radius and stellar distribution ( @xmath85 ) and an assumed the dust to have the same radial and half the vertical scalelength .",
    "the dust properties were assumed to be uniform , and we assumed a dust temperature of @xmath86 at the solar radius , and proportional to the one fifth power of the local stellar density elsewhere .",
    "we then found , for each position on the celestial sphere , the ratio of @xmath7 emission to column density of dust , and normalised this ratio by the boulanger and perault value for the ngp .",
    "subsequent to our definition of the pscz catalogue and mask , schlegel ( 1998 ) used the iras issa and cobe dirbe data to make beautiful high resolution maps of the dust emission and extinction in our galaxy .",
    "comparison of our own maps and those of schlegel show that ( a ) our temperature corrections across the galaxy are too small , and ( b ) there are several areas where cooler ( 16k ) dust extends to @xmath87 .",
    "overall , our extinction estimates may be in error by a factor 1.5 - 2 , in the sense of being too low towards the anticentre and too high towards the galactic centre .",
    "this has two principal effects .",
    "( a ) towards the anticentre , galaxies may fall below the @xmath88 limit because of extinction .",
    "a subsequent program of @xmath39-imaging has revealed a handful of extra nearby galaxies , and a significant number at redshifts 0.05 and greater .",
    "( b ) the definition of the optically - selected catalogue in section 2.3 depends on the extinction corrections .",
    "we will have selected too many optical galaxies towards the centre and too few towards the anticentre .",
    "however , our matching of addscan and psc fluxes was designed to be robust to exactly this sort of error . to test for any effect ,",
    "we have compared the simple , number - weighted dipole of the surface distribution of pscz galaxies , ( a ) using the normal catalogue and ( b ) using purely psc - derived fluxes as described in section 2.3 .",
    "the dipole changes by @xmath89 in direction and 2.5% in amplitude when we do this , showing that any bias caused by incorrect extinctions is negligible .",
    "the error quoted for psc @xmath5 fluxes for genuine point sources is just 11%(es vii.d.2 ) .",
    "we are more concerned with any non - fractional random error component , since this may lead to malmquist - type biases .",
    "the analysis in lawrence ( 1999 ) , based on the @xmath90 colours of bright stars , finds an absolute error of @xmath91 , in addition to a fractional error of 10% .",
    "stars are better point sources than galaxies , so this may underestimate the absolute error for our sample .",
    "we have made an independent estimate , by investigating the scatter between our psc and addscan fluxes .",
    "of course psc and addscan fluxes start from the same raw data , but the processing and background estimation are entirely different , while the actual photon noise is negligible .",
    "the absolute component of the scatter is @xmath92 , of which an estimated 20% comes from the error in the addscan flux - confirming that the lawrence value is a reasonable estimate of the psc absolute error component .",
    "this error estimate leads to malmquist biases in the source densities of order 5 - 6% ( differential , at the flux limit ) and 2 - 3% ( cumulative ) ( murdoch , crawford and jauncey 1973 ) .",
    "2hcon sky may have biases as large as 10% ( differential ) and 4% ( cumulative ) , so the non - uniformity introduced into the catalogue should be no worse than 5% ( differential ) and 2% ( cumulative ) .",
    "this is borne out by the source counts in figures 7 and 8 , but note that in any noise - limited catalogue such as the psc , where the noise varies across the catalogue , there will always be a regime where malmquist biases are masked by incompleteness .",
    "lawrence ( 1999 ) find evidence for slight non - linearity in the psc flux scale , but this should not affect any analysis except evolutionary studies .",
    "the effect on evolution was considered by saunders ( 1997 ) .",
    "non - uniformity can also come about as a result of simple changes in the absolute flux scale . a small fractional error in the calibration will on average lead to an error half again as large in the source density .",
    "there are three obvious reasons for flux scale variations :    \\1 ) the absolute calibration of the third 3hcon was revised by a few percent after the release of the psc ( and fss ) .",
    "the effect of this revision on psc fluxes would be to change those in the 75% of the sky covered by 3hcons by 1% .",
    "\\2 ) whenever the satellite entered the south atlantic anomaly , radiation hits altered the sensitivity of the detectors , and data taken during such times were discarded ( es iii.c.4 ) .",
    "however , this leaves the possibility of malmquist effects , and also data taken near the boundaries of the saa potentially suffers residual effects .",
    "we have investigated this by checking the source counts for declinations @xmath93 , where data taken is most likely to be affected .",
    "we see no evidence for any variation ( figure 7 ) above the few % level in source counts .",
    "\\3 ) whenever the satellite crossed the galactic plane , or other very bright sources , the detectors suffered from hysteresis .",
    "this effect was investigated by strauss ( 1990 ) .",
    "they found that the likely error is typically less than 1% and always less than 2.2% .",
    "this is confirmed by the constancy , to within a few percent , of our galaxy source counts for identified galaxies in the pscz as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "overall , differential source densities across the sky due to incompleteness , malmquist effects and sensitivity variations are not believed to be greater than a few percent anywhere at high latitudes for @xmath94 .",
    "tadros ( 1999 ) found an upper limit to the rms amplitude of large scale , high latitude spherical harmonic components to the density field of the pscz of 3% .",
    "since this is close to the expected variations due to clustering , the variations due to non - uniformity in the catalogue must be smaller than this . at lower latitudes ,",
    "variations are estimated to be no greater than 10% for @xmath95 .",
    "the @xmath74 survey of 5500 iras galaxies ( fisher 1995 ) used looser colour criteria than the pscz , and as such acts as a valuable check on the efficacy of our selection procedure from the psc .",
    "we find that the @xmath74 survey contains 11 galaxies that have been excluded by our selection criteria .",
    "it contains a further 5 galaxies that satisfy the pscz criteria , but are not included due to programming and editing errors , either during construction of the qigc survey or its various extensions and supplements to form the pscz . extrapolating these numbers to lower fluxes",
    ", we can expect that about 50 psc galaxies are missing altogether from the catalogue .",
    "conversely , the conservative selection criteria for the @xmath74 survey led to much greater levels of contamination by cirrus and other galactic sources than in the pscz . in the @xmath74 survey , these were eliminated by visual inspection of sky survey plates ; inevitably real galaxies occasionally got thrown out by mistake , especially at low latitudes .",
    "we have found , within the pscz area , 110 galaxies which are misclassified as galactic in the @xmath74 survey , and we have obtained redshifts for 67 of them .",
    "most of the remainder are fainter than our @xmath88 cutoff .",
    "there are also known to be to date a further 117 galaxies classified as galactic in the @xmath74 survey outside the pscz area .",
    "these were found as part of the ongoing ` behind the plane ' extension of the pscz to lower latitudes described in more detail in saunders ( 1999 ) .",
    "along with the psc data , the catalogue also contains the following information : poss / src plate and position on that plate ; the ra,@xmath96 , offset , diameters and magnitude of the best match from the digitised sky survey plates ; name , magnitude and diameters from ugc / eso / mcg , pgc name , de vaucouleurs type and hi widths where available ; most accurate available redshift and our own redshift measurement ; classification as galaxy / cirrus / etc ; estimated @xmath9 and extinction ; addscan flux and width when treated as an extended source , and point source filtered addscan flux .",
    "the data is available from the cds catalogue service ( http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cats.html ) .",
    "full and short versions of the catalogue , maskfiles , description files , format statements and notes , are also available via the pscz web site + ( http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/@xmath97wjs/pscz.html ) , or by anonymous ftp from ftp://ftp-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/pub/users/wjs/pscz/ .",
    "the psc - z survey has only been possible because of the generous assistance from many people in the astronomical community .",
    "we are particularly grateful to john huchra , tony fairall , karl fisher , michael strauss , marc davis , raj visvanathan , luis dacosta , riccardo giovanelli , nanyao lu , carmen pantoja , tadafumi takata , kouichiro nakanishi , toru yamada , tim conrow , delphine hardin , mick bridgeland , renee kraan - kortweg , amos yahil , ron beck , esperanza carrasco , pierre chamaraux , lucie bottinelli , gary wegner , roger clowes and brent tully , for the provision of redshifts prior to publication or other software or data .",
