    "recent work by @xcite has highlighted the scarcity of small-@xmath7 asteroids and identified possible mechanisms for their destruction .",
    "of the 34 known asteroids with @xmath8 au , the smallest has @xmath9 au , which is well beyond typical `` sungrazing '' distances of @xmath100.01 au ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a possibly overlooked source of small-@xmath7 asteroids is the database of objects discovered by solar observatories , primarily _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( _ soho _ ) .",
    "more than 3000 comets have been discovered in _",
    "soho _ images since 1996 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the vast majority belong to one of several families , whose members are dynamically related to each other and are apparently produced by cascading fragmentation from a single progenitor comet into numerous higher generation fragments .    only @xmath10100 _",
    "soho_-discovered comets are not dynamically linked to the major near - sun comet families .",
    "most do not display a coma or tail , however , these `` sporadic '' objects are designated as comets since all prior objects seen at these distances have been of apparently cometary origin .",
    "this assumption is reasonable given that _",
    "s limiting magnitude would necessitate a bare asteroid being @xmath11 km in diameter to be observed ; numerous such large objects are unlikely to be missed in the modern survey era , especially by neowise where they would be particularly bright @xcite . although these objects are almost certainly active when in the _ soho _ fields of view ( @xmath120.15 au ) , this activity is not necessarily due to the traditional `` cometary '' mechanism of sublimation of volatile ices . @xcite and",
    "@xcite argue that ( 3200 ) phaethon produces dust near perihelion ( 0.14 au ) via non - traditional means such as thermal fracture , while @xcite and others have shown that silicates and other refractory materials begin to sublimate at even smaller distances .    of the sporadic near - sun objects , comet 322p / soho  1 ( henceforth 322p ) , is the most promising for study at larger distances to investigate whether or not it is of a traditional cometary origin .",
    "322p was discovered in _",
    "soho _ images in 1999 and originally designated c/1999  r1 .",
    "it was the first _",
    "soho_-discovered object conclusively shown to be periodic @xcite and has now been observed on five apparitions : 1999 , 2003 , 2007 , 2011 , and 2015 .",
    "322p has an orbital period of 3.99 yr , an inclination of 12.7 , and @xmath13 au ( jpl horizons ) .",
    "its tisserand parameter with respect to jupiter of 2.3 is consistent with jupiter - family comets ( jfcs ; @xcite ) , although dynamical integrations to explore its prior orbital evolution are inconclusive due to its proximity to the 3:1 resonance with jupiter @xcite",
    ".    322p does not display a coma or tail in _ soho _ images , but its asymmetric lightcurve has repeated nearly identically each apparition @xcite and implies a large , unresolved cross - section of dust in the photometric aperture . its brightness has not changed substantially from apparition to apparition , implying that the depth of material lost each apparition is negligible in comparison to its total size .",
    "this suggests that 322p is significantly larger than comparably bright kreutz comets seen at similar distances which are always destroyed prior to perihelion and are therefore estimated to be @xmath1210 m ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we concluded that 322p was likely @xmath1100 m in diameter and potentially recoverable when far from the sun .",
    "322p s orbit was sufficiently constrained to attempt observations from earth prior to its 2015 perihelion passage despite having very large positional uncertainties .",
    "since no short period objects discovered by _ soho _ had ever been observed beyond the near - sun region , such observations would be unique and highly valuable for helping to understand the population .",
    "as described below , we successfully recovered 322p and acquired optical and ir follow up observations over two months to characterize its properties and investigate its likely origin .",
    "we recovered 322p with very large telescope ( vlt ) and fors2 imager on 2015 may 22 and obtained subsequent snapshot observations with vlt on june 16 and july 12 , with lowell observatory s discovery channel telescope ( dct ) and lmi camera on june 17 , 18 , and 20 , and with _ spitzer space telescope _ on july 24 .",
    "the _ spitzer _ images were taken with infrared array camera ( irac ) through the 3.6 and 4.5   filters @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of all ground - based images were obtained through the @xmath14 filter in order to obtain a lightcurve and look for faint dust features , but sets of @xmath15 and @xmath16 were also obtained may 22 and june 16 for color information .",
    "all observations were conducted at the comet s ephemeris rate .",
    "observing circumstances and telescope details are given in table  [ t : obs_circ ] .",
    "we attempted to observe 322p with dct contemporaneously with _",
    "spitzer _ on july 24 but could only set a weakly restrictive brightness upper limit because of clouds . due to 322p s high southern declination , all dct observations were obtained for short duration at high airmass and were therefore substantially noisier than the vlt observations .",

    "the combination of optical and ir observations allows us to constrain 322p s albedo and size with near earth asteroid thermal modeling ( neatm ; @xcite ) .",

    "we use the @xmath44 statistic to assess relative goodness of fit , but realize its absolute value has little meaning in this context . for each @xmath35 and @xmath41 combination",
    ", we repeated our fitting procedure with 1000 new input data sets normally distributed about the observed values using their estimated uncertainties . figure  [ fig : model ] shows example best - fit @xmath42 and @xmath43 pairs .",

    "a subset of the spectral slope @xmath35 , and beaming parameter @xmath41 values are presented here to illustrate their minimal effects on the retrieved values .",
    "the gray - shaded panels have higher @xmath44 values suggesting those @xmath35 , @xmath41 pairs are less likely.,width=332 ]    [ lastfig ]    the large uncertainties on our optical magnitudes combined with the number of free parameters prevents unequivocally deriving a unique solution for 322p s diameter and geometric albedo . despite this ,",
    "322p s geometric albedo is evidently substantially higher than typical values for cometary nuclei ( 0.020.06 ; @xcite ) .",
    "such low geometric albedos are incompatible with the _ spitzer _ 3.6 @xmath38 m data and would require an unusually high @xmath41 .",
    "however , @xmath43 is consistent with the geometric albedos of many asteroids , notably including v- and q - types @xcite and those having small-@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the modeling confirms our assumption that 322p was substantially larger than typical kreutz comets seen close to the sun .",
    "other than the kreutz family and fragments of recently split comets like c/1999 s4 linear @xcite , 322p is the smallest comet nucleus ever identified @xcite .",
    "such small comets may not be necessarily rare but simply difficult to detect because they are so faint .",
    "322p is not unusual compared to the sizes of known neas , where @xmath10100 m diameter objects are common @xcite    as shown in figure  [ fig : image ] , the radial profile was consistent with profiles of untrailed stars suggesting cometary activity is minimal or absent .",
    "we estimate that any undetected coma had a surface brightness @xmath1028 mag arcsec@xmath46 or fainter at a distance of 2.5 arcsec on june 16 . assuming a steady state coma",
    ", we estimate the total magnitude of any undetected coma to be @xmath1924.0 following @xcite , and convert this to @xmath47 cm @xcite for an assumed dust albedo of 0.04 .",
    "we next attempt to constrain 322p s lifetime with some order of magnitude calculations about its total mass loss per orbit . the undetected coma upper limit can be converted to a cross section of dust and then to a combined dust mass of @xmath12200 kg using standard assumptions about the dust s geometric albedo ( 0.04 ) , density ( 3000 kg m@xmath2 ) , and radius ( 1 @xmath38 m ) .",
    "if the albedo or density are closer to the values derived for the nucleus above , the dust mass will be even smaller . assuming the dust crosses our photometric aperture at @xmath121 km s@xmath23 sets a conservative upper limit to the mass loss rate of @xmath48 kg s@xmath23 at 1.419 au .",
    "we repeat the calculation when 322p is in the _ soho _ field of view , where it reaches a peak @xmath49 in an aperture of radius @xmath50 @xcite at perihelion . near perihelion ,",
    "the sublimation lifetime of dust grains ( @xmath10100 sec for amorphous olivine ; @xcite ) may dominate the aperture crossing time ( @xmath110@xmath51 sec ) , so we estimate the dust spends @xmath110010@xmath51 sec in the aperture , yielding a peak mass loss rate of @xmath12202000 kg s@xmath23 . assuming a power - law slope between these points and integrating around the orbit , we find that the total mass lost is dominated by activity at perihelion and is highly assumption dependent . for the low and high activity cases ,",
    "the total mass lost per orbit is @xmath52 kg . for a diameter of 200 m and a density of 1500 kg m@xmath2 ,",
    "322p s active lifetime is therefore likely to be @xmath53 yr , which is comparable to or shorter than estimates of the total dynamical lifetimes of jfcs and neas , @xmath54 yr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , 322p may be destroyed by sublimation - driven mass loss sooner than it is removed by dynamical processes , although we caution that the activity calculations are extremely uncertain .",
    "our observations of 322p / soho 1 suggest that it may be of classically asteroidal rather than cometary origin .",
    "it appears inactive , has a rotation period that is faster than any known comet and implies a density @xmath191000 kg m@xmath2 , has a higher albedo than has ever been measured for a comet nucleus , and has colors rather atypical for a comet and most consistent with v- and q - type asteroids .",
    "the unweathered spectra of q - types seem to correlate with recent close approaches to planets @xcite ; given 322p s small @xmath7 , similar processing may be occurring .",
    "however , no comet nucleus has ever been studied following such a close perihelion passage , and we can not exclude the possibility that 322p s unusual properties are caused by its extreme orbit , where equilibrium temperatures exceed 1000 k at perihelion .",
    "it is possible that 322p s repeated close approaches to the sun devolatilized its outer layers and caused changes to the surface , such as annealing , that are sufficient to alter its properties ( albedo , color ) and increase its strength against rotational breakup .",
    "if 322p is an `` active asteroid , '' it has the smallest @xmath7 of any known asteroid .",
    "all asteroids with @xmath8 au reach perihelion within _ soho _ s field of view , but we are only aware of phaethon having been detected . _",
    "soho _ data are routinely scoured for moving objects by multiple comet hunters , so it is unlikely that all such objects would have gone undetected if visible . since both phaethon and 322p display evidence of being active inside @xmath100.15 au ,",
    "the lack of detections of any other small-@xmath7 asteroids in the _ soho _ fields of view is likely significant .",
    "all of the small-@xmath7 asteroids studied by @xcite had absolute magnitudes brighter than 322p , so if they are active by the same mechanism as 322p , they should have been detectable when in the _ soho _ field of view despite their larger @xmath7 values .",
    "thus , 322p may be different from typical small-@xmath7 asteroids .",
    "one possible difference is that 322p may have undergone a recent breakup that exposed parts of its interior which could be more easily lost on subsequent perihelion passages .",
    "three other _",
    "soho_-discovered objects have been suggested to be dynamically linked to 322p as part of the `` kracht-2 group '' @xcite and could be fragments of such an event .",
    "since 322p s orbit is well beyond the distances where tidal forces should be significant ( @xcite and references therein ) , breakup would likely have been caused by other mechanisms such as rotational spin - up or heating - driven fracture .",
    "such processes have recently been suggested by @xcite as the mechanisms by which small-@xmath7 asteroids are destroyed .",
    "thus , 322p may be providing a near - real time glimpse at a common end state of small bodies in the solar system and warrants further inquiry .",
