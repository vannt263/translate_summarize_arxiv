    "x  ray observations are excellent probes of coronally active and accreting sources . whereas studies of x  ray sources in our galaxy have to a large extent focussed on bright systems , investigations of fainter source classes",
    "have typically been done in the galactic center ( e.g.  @xcite ) . there , however , crowding and extinction make it more difficult to identify the correct optical and/or infrared counterparts for large fractions of the sources ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear from previous surveys that multi  wavelength observations are vital for classifying faint x ",
    "ray sources since x  ray spectral information alone is rarely sufficient .",
    "classification is important for various science goals as we outline below .",
    "the galactic bulge survey ( gbs ) we present in this paper was designed to allow multi ",
    "wavelength observations of the detected x  ray sources .",
    "the gbs consists of and optical imaging of two strips of @xmath5 , one centered @xmath6 above the galactic plane and the other @xmath6 below the plane .",
    "we have chosen this area as the source density is still high , but by excluding @xmath7 we avoid the regions that are most heavily affected by extinction and source confusion ( see figure  [ changbs ] ) . in table",

    "we list the nearest one .",
    "+ @xmath9 these two sources are 4.8 apart ; these are likely two detections of the same source .",
    "we have started the galactic bulge survey ( gbs ) with the goals : i ) to identify quiescent , eclipsing ns and bh x  ray binaries that are bright enough in the optical or near  infrared to allow phase resolved spectroscopic observations tailored to measure the compact object mass .",
    "ii ) to constrain binary population synthesis and x  ray binary formation and evolution models by means of a source number count and a study of the spatial distribution of x  ray binaries .    in this paper",
    "we have presented the source list and some properties of the x  ray sources of observations covering @xmath10two - thirds ( @xmath11 square degrees ) of the total envisaged survey area of 12 square degrees .",
    "the accurate source position will help identify the optical counterparts .",
    "the 1234 x  ray sources that have been discovered so far compares well with the total number of @xmath12 x  ray sources that we predict we should detect in the full 12 square degrees . however , this is of course no guarantee that the number of sources per source class are close to those we calculated .",
    "we compared our source list with the source list of the rass .",
    "two bsc rass sources , 1rxs  j175113.2 - 293842 and 1rxs  j174220.8 - 273736 , are not detected in our gbs survey , indicating a decrease in flux with factors larger than 200 and 500 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we compared our source list with the sources found in the catalog of sources derived from pointed hri and pspc rosat observations that fall inside the gbs area ( see table 3 ) .",
    "we also imaged the complete survey area using optical observations obtained with the 4 m blanco telescope at ctio .",
    "furthermore , we re - imaged the survey area @xmath1330 times in the @xmath14 band to search for ( periodic ) variable sources .",
    "results of these campaigns will be presented in forthcoming papers .",
    "we are in the process of obtaining optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of all optical proposed counterparts in the error circle to classify the x  ray sources .",
    "this step is crucial to achieve our science goals outlined above .",
    "a full discussion of all known information on all the x  ray sources is beyond the scope of this paper and we defer the discussion of the other fainter sources to a forthcoming paper , where they will be discussed together with optical photometric and spectroscopic information .",
