    "for over a decade now , the finite - element method has been developed for application to quantum systems .",
    "( for a review of the program see @xcite . )",
    "the essence of the approach is to put the heisenberg equations of motion for the quantum system on a minkowski space - time lattice in such a way as to preserve exactly the canonical commutation relations at each lattice site .",
    "doing so corresponds precisely to the classical finite - element prescription of requiring continuity at the lattice sites while imposing the equations of motion at the gaussian knots , a prescription chosen to minimize numerical error .",
    "we have applied this technique to examples in quantum mechanics and to quantum field theories in two and four space - time dimensions . in particular , recent work has concentrated on abelian and non - abelian gauge theories @xcite .    because it is the equations of motion that are discretized , a lattice lagrangian does not exist in minkowski space .",
    "this is because the equations of motion are in general nonlocal , involving fields at all previous ( but not later ) times .",
    "similarly , a lattice hamiltonian does not exist , in the sense of an operator from which the equations of motion can be derived .",
    "however , because the formulation is unitary , a unitary time - evolution operator must exist which carries fields from one lattice time to the next . for linear finite elements",
    "this operator in quantum mechanics has been explicitly constructed @xcite .",
    "construction of this operator requires solving the equations of motion , which are implicit .",
    "therefore , it is most useful , and perhaps surprising , that when matrix elements of the time evolution operator are constructed in a harmonic oscillator basis , they do not require the solution of the equations of motion @xcite .",
    "although these general formulas were derived some years ago , it seems they have not been exploited .",
    "my purpose here is to study , in a simple context , the matrix elements of the evolution operator , and see how accurately spectral information may be extracted .",
    "my goal , of course , is to apply similar techniques in gauge theories , for example , to study chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "let us consider a quantum mechanical system with one degree of freedom governed by the continuum hamiltonian @xmath3 from which follow the heisenberg equations @xmath4 these equations are to be solved subject to the initial condition @xmath5=i.\\ ] ] it immediately follows from ( [ eqm ] ) that the same relation holds at any later time @xmath6=i.\\ ] ]    now suppose we introduce a time lattice by subdividing the interval @xmath7 into @xmath1 subintervals each of length @xmath8 . on each subinterval ( `` finite element '' )",
    "we express the dynamical variables as @xmath9th degree polynomials @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a local variable ranging from @xmath12 to @xmath8 .",
    "we determine the @xmath13 operator coefficients @xmath14 , @xmath15 , as follows :    1 .",
    "on the first finite element let @xmath16 2 .",
    "impose the equations of motion ( [ eqm ] ) at @xmath9 points within the finite element , at @xmath17 , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "this then gives @xmath20 3 .",
    "proceed to the next finite element by requiring continuity ( but not continuity of derivatives ) at the lattice sites , that is , on the second finite element , set @xmath21 and again impose the equations of motion at @xmath22 , and so on .",
    "how are the @xmath23 s determined ? by requiring preservation of the canonical commutation relations at each lattice site , @xmath24=[q_0,p_0]=i , \\label{unitarity}\\ ] ] one finds @xmath25 these points are exactly the gaussian knots , that is , the roots of the @xmath9th legendre polynomial , @xmath26 amazingly , these are precisely the points at which the numerical error is minimized . it is known for classical equations that if one uses @xmath1 @xmath9th degree finite elements the relative error goes like @xmath27 , while imposing the equations at any other points would give errors like @xmath28 .",
    "let us consider a simple example .",
    "the quartic anharmonic oscillator has continuum hamiltonian @xmath29 for which the equations of motion are @xmath30 if we use the linear ( @xmath31 ) finite - element prescription given above , the corresponding discrete lattice equations are @xmath32 ( notice the easily remembered mnemonic for linear finite elements : derivatives are replaced by forward differences , while undifferentiated operators are replaced by forward averages . ) by commuting the first of these equations with @xmath33 and the second with @xmath34 the unitarity condition ( [ unitarity ] ) follows immediately .",
    "these equations are implicit , in the sense that we must solve a nonlinear equation to find @xmath35 and @xmath36 in terms of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "although such a solution can be given , let use make a simple approximation , by expanding the dynamical operators at time 1 in powers of @xmath8 , with operator coefficients at time 0",
    ". those coefficients are determined by ( [ leqm ] ) , and a very simple calculation yields @xmath39 we can define fock space creation and annihilation operators in terms of the initial - time operators @xmath40 which satisfy @xmath41=1.\\ ] ] here we have introduced an arbitrary variational parameter @xmath42 .",
    "the fock - space states ( harmonic oscillator states ) are created and destroyed by these operators : @xmath43 which states are not energy eigenstates of the anharmonic oscillator .",
    "we can now take matrix elements in these states of the dynamical operators at lattice site 1 , using ( [ exp ] ) : @xmath44 and @xmath45 where we have assumed approximately exponential dependence on the energy difference @xmath46 .",
    "equating the coefficients of the terms through order @xmath47 constitutes four equations in two unknowns .",
    "these equations are consistent and yield @xmath48 so the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state is approximately @xmath49 which is only 5% higher than the exact result @xmath50 .",
    "a similar calculation using quadratic finite elements ( @xmath51 ) reduces the error to 0.5% .",
    "because the canonical commutation relations are preserved at each lattice site , we know that there is a unitary time evolution operator that carries dynamical variable forward in time : @xmath52 for the system described by the continuum hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) in the linear finite - element scheme , we have found @xcite the following formula for @xmath53 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 ^ 2+v(g^{-1}(4x / h^2)),\\ ] ] @xmath56 the implicit nature of the finite - element prescription is evident in the appearance of the inverse of the function @xmath57 .    given the time evolution operator , a lattice hamiltonian may be defined by @xmath58 . for linear finite elements @xmath59 differs from the continuum hamiltonian by terms of order @xmath47 .",
    "for example , @xmath60,\\label{hc}\\\\ v={\\lambda\\over3}q^3 : & & { \\cal h}={1\\over2}p^2+{1\\over3}\\lambda q^3 + h^2\\left[{\\lambda\\over12}pqp+p^3\\right]+\\dots,\\\\ v={\\lambda\\over4}q^4 : & & { \\cal h}={1\\over2}p^2+{1\\over4}\\lambda q^4 + h^2\\left[-{\\lambda^2\\over24}q^6-{\\lambda\\over8}qp^2q\\right]+\\dots .",
    "\\label{ahc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if one uses quadratic finite elements @xmath59 differs from the continuum hamiltonian by terms of order @xmath61 , etc .",
    "remarkably , it is not necessary to solve the equations of motion to compute matrix elements of the dynamical variable . introduce creation and annihilation operators as in ( [ aadag ] ) .",
    "then , in terms of harmonic oscillator states ( [ hostates ] ) the following formula is easily derived @xcite for a general matrix element of @xmath35 : @xmath62 where @xmath57 is given by ( [ gee ] ) , @xmath63 is the @xmath64th hermite polynomial , and we have introduced the abbreviations @xmath65 for the example of the harmonic oscillator , this formula gives for the ground state ",
    "first excited state energy difference @xmath66 , consistent with ( [ hc ] ) , while for the anharmonic oscillator if we expand in @xmath8 we obtain precisely the expansion ( [ q1 ] ) .",
    "a similar formula can be derived for the harmonic oscillator matrix elements of the time evolution operator .",
    "( there is an error in the formula printed in @xcite . )",
    "@xmath67 } , \\label{umat}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which again is expressed in terms of @xmath57 not @xmath68 .    for the harmonic oscillator , where @xmath69 , ( [ umat ] ) gives for the ground - state energy @xmath70 which follows from ( [ hc ] ) . for the anharmonic oscillator , @xmath71 , again , for a first look",
    ", we expand in powers of @xmath8 , with the result , for the harmonic oscillator ground state , @xmath72 which is also derivable from ( [ ahc ] ) .",
    "equating powers of @xmath8 gives us two equations , which are to be solved first for the dimensionless number @xmath73 .",
    "once the number @xmath74 is determined , the value of @xmath75 is expressed as @xmath76    for a first estimate , we use the `` principle of minimum sensitivity '' , that is , use the stationary value of @xmath74 , @xmath77 which is about 2% higher than the exact value of 0.42081 @xcite .",
    "in fact , when we solve ( [ woo ] ) for @xmath74 we find a complex value @xmath78 the imaginary part is small , and the real part is only 0.7% low . the failure of ( [ wo1 ] ) to be real does not indicate any breakdown of unitarity , but only that the one state approximation is not exact .",
    "we do much better by making a two - state approximation , where we must diagonalize the @xmath79 matrix @xmath80 we then find the following relation between @xmath81 and @xmath82 : @xmath83 , \\label{omgood}\\ ] ] which , for the @xmath84 sign , is plotted in fig .  1 :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ fig .  1 .",

    "the simple calculations given here for the quantum - mechanical anharmonic oscillator are the beginning of a program to develop use of lattice hamiltonian techniques to explore gauge theories in the finite - element context .",
