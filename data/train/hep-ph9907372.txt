    "the sighting of a supernova , sn1987a in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xcite , led to great excitement , since , for the first time , the neutrinos from stellar collapse were detected by earth ",
    "based detectors @xcite . unlike electromagnetic radiation , which takes a long time to emerge from the collapsing core ,",
    "neutrinos provide direct information about core collapse .",
    "the direct observation of neutrinos from sn1987a by the kamiokande ( kii ) @xcite and the imb @xcite detectors forms the beginning of a new phase in neutrino astrophysics with far  reaching implications for particle physics .",
    "since then , the kii detector has been upgraded with tremendous improvement both in size and resolution , and many new detectors like sno and borexino will begin taking data soon .",
    "immediately after sn1987a , several authors analysed @xcite the neutrino events recorded by the kii and the imb detectors . while the number of events were not statistically significant enough to obtain quantitative information on the neutrino spectrum , there was a qualitative agreement between the predictions from the core collapse mechanism and the observations .",
    "the present situation with improved neutrino detectors affords quantitative analysis of the neutrino events if a supernova collapse were to take place in the near future .",
    "while the observational scenario is positive , there has also been much progress in understanding the properties of neutrinos , namely their masses and mixings , through the analyses of solar and atmospheric neutrino puzzles @xcite .",
    "both the solar and atmospheric neutrino deficits that are observed conclusively point to the requirement of ( at least ) three neutrino generations and mixing among them .",
    "the masses and mixings are then constrained by the observed deficit in the neutrino fluxes @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analyse in detail the signatures of neutrinos from stellar collapse .",
    "the analysis is confined to type ii supernovae ( which occur when the initial mass of the star is between 820 solar masses ) since the neutrino emission from these are significant enough to make reasonable predictions .",
    "we consider the emission of all three types of neutrino ( and antineutrino ) flavours .",
    "there exist many models of stellar collapse .",
    "the present understanding of neutrino emission involves dividing the neutrino emission into two distinct phases  the neutronisation burst and thermal neutrino emission .",
    "the number of neutrinos emitted during the burst phase is only a few percent of the neutrinos emitted during the thermal or cooling phase of the proto - neutron star .",
    "while only @xmath0 is emitted during the earlier phase , neutrinos and antineutrinos of all types are emitted during the final phase .",
    "much of the binding energy of the neutron star is radiated away as neutrinos while a small fraction ( few percents or less ) is deposited in the shock wave that blows away the mantle @xcite .",
    "detailed predictions for the luminosity and average energy as a function of time are available @xcite for neutrinos emitted during the burst and the cooling phase .",
    "we use these predictions as an input in our analysis .    an important fact to note",
    "is that the neutrinos , which are produced in the high dense region of the core , interact with matter before emerging from the supernova .",
    "the presence of non - zero masses and mixing in vacuum among various neutrino flavours results in strong matter dependent effects , including conversion from one flavour to another .",
    "hence , the observed neutrino flux in the detectors may be dramatically different for certain neutrino flavours , for certain values of mixing parameters , due to neutrino oscillations .",
    "the effect of mixing on the neutrino signal from supernovae has been analysed in detail before by several authors @xcite .",
    "the effect of masses and mixing on time - of - flight information has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "our analysis is based on the pioneering work of kuo and pantaleone @xcite where they include mixing among all three neutrino flavours . however , unlike all the previous analyses , we take into account the constraints on the neutrino mixing and masses imposed @xcite by solutions consistent with the solar and atmospheric neutrino puzzles .",
    "there are several possible solutions here , including a purely vacuum solution for the solar neutrino problem .",
    "we choose some typical ( allowed ) values for the mixing angles , to illustrate the possible effects of mixing .",
    "this is important from the point of view of integrating known constraints on the neutrino masses and mixings in order to obtain a realistic picture of neutrino emissions from supernovae .",
    "we analyse in detail the dependence of the recoil energy spectra on the mixing parameters , at water cerenkov detectors . in sec .",
    "ii we review the theoretical framework of our calculation , including a reanalysis of the matter effects on the neutrino spectrum in the hot dense core . sec .",
    "iii highlights the various inputs ",
    "neutrino fluxes and cross - sections in the detector  that we have used in order to compute the event rate expected at water cerenkov neutrino detectors .",
    "the numerical computation of the total number of events for the time integrated neutrino spectrum , and the effects of neutrino oscillation , are discussed in sec .",
    "iv , where the results are discussed and summarised .",
    "some well - known results , adapted to the present situation , are discussed in appendices a and b for completeness .",
    "in this section , we discuss the mixing among three flavours of neutrinos ( or antineutrinos ) and compute the electron ( or antielectron ) neutrino survival probability , @xmath1 ( or @xmath2 ) . we will explicitly show that these are the only relevant probabilities . while the theoretical details of this mixing are well - known , the effects of super - dense matter , such as is found in the stellar cores , are non - trivial .",
    "we shall also use this analysis to set our notation .",
    "the three flavour eigenstates are related to the three mass eigenstates in vacuum through a unitary transformation , @xmath3 = u^v   \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\nu_1 \\\\ \\nu_2 \\\\ \\nu_3   \\end{array } \\right],\\ ] ] where the superscript @xmath4 on the r.h.s .",
    "stands for vacuum .",
    "the @xmath5 unitary matrix , @xmath6 , can be parametrised by three euler angles @xmath7 and a phase .",
    "the form of the unitary matrix can therefore be written , in general , as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mixing matrix between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 mass eigenstates with the mixing angle @xmath12 .",
    "it has been shown that the expression for electron neutrino survival probability , integrated over the time of emission and of absorption , is independent of the phase and the third euler angle @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "they can be set to zero without loss of generality and we have the following form for @xmath6 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 , etc",
    ". the angles @xmath17 and @xmath18 can take values between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "recently , the chooz collaboration set a laboratory limit on @xmath21 oscillations @xcite that resulted in a strong limit , @xmath22 , on the ( 13 ) mixing angle @xcite .",
    "however , a combination of solar and atmospheric neutrino data allows for both large and small angle solutions for the ( 12 ) mixing angle , @xmath17 .",
    "the angle @xmath13 is large , typically of the order of @xmath23 ( although this is not relevant here ) .",
    "these constraints will be imposed later on in our numerical analysis .",
    "the masses of the eigenstates in vacuum are taken to be @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in the mass eigenbasis ,",
    "the @xmath27 matrix is diagonal : @xmath28 where the mass squared differences are given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 . without loss of generality , we can take @xmath31 and @xmath32 to be greater than zero ; this defines the standard hierarchy of masses .",
    "neutrino oscillation amplitudes are independent of the first term so we drop it from further calculation . in the flavour basis , therefore , the relevant part of the mass squared matrix has the form , @xmath33 where @xmath34 the relevant matter effects may be included by a modified mass squared matrix , @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 which is proportional to the electron number density , @xmath39 , in the supernova core . here",
    "@xmath40 is the radial distance from the centre of the star .",
    "the detailed modifications due to matter effects are discussed in appendix a.    the maximum value of @xmath41 occurs at the core and is approximately @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the neutrino energy in mev .",
    "the modification due to the matter dependence is similar to the case of solar neutrinos , although , unlike in the case of solar neutrinos , all flavours are produced in the supernova core .",
    "it is clear that the mass squared matrix is no longer diagonal in the presence of matter ; we therefore diagonalise @xmath44 in order to determine the matter corrected eigenstates .",
    "this is a difficult problem in general for arbitrary values of @xmath32 and @xmath31 .",
    "these are however constrained by the limits on them given by the simultaneous analysis of solar and atmospheric neutrino problems , namely @xmath45 ev@xmath46 and @xmath47 ev@xmath46 , so that @xmath48 ; the value of @xmath41 for energetic neutrinos ( of a few mev to tens of mev ) in the core is therefore several orders of magnitude greater than these mass - squared differences .",
    "the eigenvalue problem may thus be solved perturbatively , with the following hierarchy : @xmath49 .",
    "as a result , the electron neutrino undergoes two well - separated resonances when the value of @xmath37 approaches the two mass squared differences . following kuo and pantaleone @xcite , and using the above mass hierarchy ,",
    "the matter mixing angle @xmath50 is given by ( see appendix a for more details ) , @xmath51 at the point of production inside the core , @xmath52 ; thus , @xmath53 .",
    "this makes further calculations extremely simple , since the electron neutrino is produced as a pure @xmath54 mass eigenstate in the core of the supernova .",
    "the survival probability of the electron neutrino is simply given by the projection of the @xmath55 mass eigenstate on to the @xmath56 flavour state in the detector , after correcting for the landau - zener jumps which may occur in the stellar matter during propagation .",
    "the average survival probability of the electron neutrino is therefore given by @xmath57 here @xmath18 and @xmath17 are the vacuum mixing angles defined earlier and @xmath58 denote the landau - zener jump probabilities among the mass eigenstates , @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 denote the jump probabilities at the higher and at the lower resonances . in appendix",
    "b we show that for the parameters values relevant in the case of neutrinos produced in the supernova core , @xmath60 is actually very close to zero . therefore to a good approximation",
    ", we may write , @xmath62 this result implies that the propagation of neutrinos is adiabatic in the high dense core .",
    "we will support this conclusion in appendix b. the information given above is not enough to obtain completely the survival and oscillation probabilities of the individual flavours .",
    "however , since the detectors we are interested in do not separately detect @xmath63 and @xmath64 , this is sufficient for our analysis .",
    "we shall therefore use this form for the survival probability for the numerical results calculated in the next section .",
    "we now consider the case of @xmath21 propagation in high dense matter .",
    "the only change in this case is that the matter dependent term in the relevant part of the mass squared matrix has the opposite sign ( to that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defa ] ) ) , that is , @xmath65 the analysis goes through as in the case of @xmath0 propagation through matter and the mixing angle , @xmath18 , for antineutrinos in matter is given by , @xmath66 on using the fact that @xmath67 , we obtain @xmath68 in contrast to the solution @xmath53 for electron neutrinos .",
    "thus @xmath69 is produced in the mass eigenstate , @xmath70 , in the core of the supernova .",
    "there are no landau - zener jumps to consider in this case since the resonance conditions are never satisfied unless the mass hierarchy is altered .",
    "the propagation is therefore adiabatic and the survival probability is obtained by simply projecting the @xmath71 eigenstate on to the flavour eigenstate in vacuum ( at the detector ) . the antineutrino survival probability is therefore given by , @xmath72 where @xmath18 and @xmath17 are as usual the vacuum mixing angles defined earlier .",
    "we need the inputs of neutrino flux emission at the supernova , and neutrino cross - section at the detector , in order to obtain the event rates .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the neutrino fluxes .      following kuo and pantaleone @xcite",
    ", we denote the flux of various flavours of neutrinos and antineutrinos produced in the core of the supernova by @xmath73 , where @xmath74 denotes all the flavours .",
    "in particular we use the generic label @xmath75 for flavours other than @xmath0 and @xmath76 since @xmath77 all these flavours are produced via the neutral - current ( nc ) pair production processes and therefore have the same flux for all practical purposes .",
    "however , the @xmath0 and @xmath76 fluxes are different from each other and the rest since they are produced not only by pair production but also derive contribution from charged - current ( cc ) processes .    in the presence of matter",
    ", the flux emerging from the core undergoes changes due to oscillations as was discussed in the previous section .",
    "the flux reaching the detector from a supernova at a distance @xmath78 from earth is reduced by an overall geometric factor of @xmath79 .",
    "apart from this , there is a further modification of the observed flux due to oscillations .",
    "the flux on earth , in the various flavours , is given in terms of the flux of neutrinos produced in the core of the supernova by , @xmath80 where we have made use of the constraint @xmath81 and @xmath82 denotes the probability of a flavour @xmath83 or @xmath84 neutrino emerging as an electron neutrino .",
    "since @xmath85 and @xmath86induced events can not be separated in water cerenkov detectors , their combined flux on earth may be written as @xmath87 note that flavour mixing does not affect the total flux .",
    "similar expressions hold for antineutrino flavours with appropriate changes , that is , @xmath88 and @xmath89 since @xmath90 , in general , the mixing breaks the equality of the @xmath91 and @xmath92 fluxes .",
    "we use the luminosity and average energy distributions ( as functions of time ) as given in totani et al .",
    "@xcite , based on the numerical modelling of mayle , wilson and schramm @xcite .",
    "the neutrino number flux is described , in a given time interval , @xmath93 , as a thermal fermi dirac distribution , @xmath94 for neutrinos of flavour @xmath95 and energy @xmath43 at a time @xmath96 after the core bounce . here",
    "@xmath74 refers to the time - bin , @xmath97 .",
    "hereafter , we set the time of bounce , @xmath98 .",
    "the overall normalisation , @xmath99 , is fixed by requiring that the total energy emitted per unit time equals the luminosity , @xmath100 , in that time interval .    the thermal distribution that we have used ( where the chemical potential has been set to zero ) results in a flux that shows a slower fall with energy , @xmath43 , than the results of the corresponding numerical model used in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , the effect of this on the event rates is small , of the order of a few percent .",
    "typically , this distribution corresponds to an average neutrino energy or temperature ( @xmath101 ) of @xmath102 mev , @xmath103 mev , and @xmath104 mev . beyond about 1 second after the bounce",
    ", the average energies remain constant over the emission times of the supernova . however , the luminosities decrease , with very little emission beyond 10 seconds .",
    "hence , in order to compute the event rates , we consider neutrino emission up to 10 seconds after bounce .",
    "the total emitted energy in all flavours of neutrinos up to this time is about @xmath105 ergs , which is more or less equally distributed in all flavours .",
    "the number of neutrinos emitted in each flavour , however , is not the same since their average energies are different .",
    "the basic quantity we are interested in is the distribution of events in the detector as a function of the energy of the detected particle . in the case of a water cerenkov detector",
    ", this corresponds to the detection of a charged lepton in the final state .",
    "here we are concerned with detection of electrons ( or positrons ) with energy , @xmath106 .",
    "the various processes of interest therefore are the interactions of the neutrinos    1 .   with electrons in water as targets",
    ": @xmath107 2 .   with free protons in water as targets : @xmath108 3 .   with oxygen nuclei in water as targets : @xmath109    the cross - sections , @xmath110 , for all these processes , except the ones on oxygen , are well known @xcite .",
    "the oxygen cross - sections have been taken from fig .  1 of haxton @xcite .",
    "as the interactions on protons and oxygen nuclei are purely cc interactions , they involve only @xmath0 and @xmath21 .",
    "reaction ( 1 ) involves both cc and nc interactions for @xmath0 and @xmath21 and only nc interactions for all other flavours .",
    "the @xmath111 cross - section is the largest , being proportional to the square of the antineutrino energy . in terms of total number of events ,",
    "therefore , water cerenkov detectors are mostly dominated by @xmath21 events .",
    "however , the different interactions in the detector have distinct angular signatures ; this may be used to distinguish them .",
    "the elastic electron cross - sections are forward peaked , especially for neutrinos with energies 10 mev @xcite , while the proton cross - section is isotropic in the lab frame .",
    "finally , the cc @xmath0 ( @xmath21 ) cross - section on oxygen , although having a rather large threshold of 15.4 mev ( 11.4 mev ) @xcite , increases rapidly with incoming neutrino energy and is somewhat backward peaked .",
    "the higher the temperature at which the neutrino is emitted , the larger is this backward peak ; hence it may be possible to distinguish this contribution from the rest by angular resolution as well , especially if there is substantial mixing between @xmath0 ( or @xmath21 ) and @xmath91 since the latter have a considerably hotter spectrum .",
    "the time integrated event rate , from neutrinos of flavour @xmath95 and energy @xmath43 , as a function of the recoil electron ( or positron ) energy is given by , @xmath112 where the flux distribution , @xmath113 includes the effects of mixing in the hot dense core and the index @xmath96 refers to any of the various processes through which the neutrino @xmath95 can interact with the detector . here",
    "@xmath114 refers to the number of scattering targets ( of either @xmath115 , @xmath116 or @xmath117 ) that are available in the detector .",
    "the total number of events from a given flavour of neutrino in a given bin , @xmath118 , of electron energy ( which we choose to be of width 1 mev ) then is the sum over all possible processes integrated over the bin width of the event rate : @xmath119 in the next section , we shall use this formula to compute the time integrated event rates for neutrino scattering with and without mixing , in water cerenkov detectors , as a function of the detected electron ( or positron ) energy , in order to examine the effects of neutrino oscillations on supernova neutrino fluxes .",
    "we compute the time integrated event rate at a prototype 1 kton water cerenkov detector from neutrinos emitted by a supernova exploding 10 kpc away . results for any other supernova explosion",
    "may be obtained by scaling the event rate by the appropriate distance to the supernova and the size of the detector , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate ] ) .",
    "we assume the efficiency and resolution of such a detector to be perfect .",
    "including these effects does not change the results by more than a few percents , as we will see .",
    "in fact , the maximum variation is at low energies , close to the threshold , where the low detector efficiency leads to lower detection rates .",
    "the following constraints derived from solar and atmospheric neutrino observations are imposed .",
    "we begin with the constraints in the neutrino sector . here , the angle @xmath17 does not play a role . as stated earlier , the ( 13 ) mixing angle",
    "is severely restricted : @xmath120 .",
    "the solar and atmospheric neutrino problems allow for a wider choice in @xmath18 .",
    "this restriction on @xmath18 comes mainly from the chooz experiment @xcite .",
    "since the survival probability , @xmath1 depends only on this angle ( @xmath121 ) ; this implies that @xmath122 and is thus very small .",
    "the observed dynamics of electron  type neutrinos , therefore , is completely driven by mu and tau  type neutrinos produced in the supernova : @xmath123 hence , due to mixing , the original electron neutrino flux is virtually replaced by the @xmath83 or @xmath84 neutrino flux .",
    "the cross - sections at the detector increase with energy .",
    "since the average energy of @xmath91 is of the order of @xmath124 mev while that of @xmath0 is @xmath125 mev , the effect of mixing and matter in the dense core is to dramatically increase the number of events due to @xmath115type neutrinos while reducing the corresponding @xmath91 contribution .",
    "we now discuss the antineutrino sector .",
    "while the same limits apply on @xmath18 , we now have to consider the limits on the @xmath126 mixing angle @xmath17 as well .",
    "the constraints on @xmath17 mainly emerge from the solar neutrino problem .",
    "( for a recent review , see ref .",
    "the best global msw fit gives @xmath127 ev@xmath46 and @xmath128 .",
    "there is also a large angle solution with msw fit . for vacuum oscillations ,",
    "the fit gives @xmath129 ev@xmath46 and @xmath130 . in the present analysis , @xmath131 ev@xmath46 ,",
    "which is consistent with both msw and vacuum solutions . for @xmath17 ,",
    "therefore , we choose two possible values , viz . , @xmath17 small and @xmath17 large .",
    "these two typical choices cover the extreme ends of the possible effects of mixing in supernova neutrinos .",
    "if @xmath17 is small ( corresponding to the msw solution to the solar neutrino problem ) , then the antineutrino survival probability becomes , @xmath132 , since @xmath18 is small .",
    "this , in effect , is similar to the no - mixing solution .",
    "the large angle solution allows for a near - maximal mixing of @xmath133 ; in this case , the survival probability becomes , @xmath134 and this corresponds to maximal mixing in the antineutrino sector .",
    "therefore we have , @xmath135 in any case , we have the result that @xmath2 0.5 for any choice of @xmath17 when @xmath18 is small .",
    "hence , typically , the antineutrino fluxes that reach the earth are combinations of @xmath21 and @xmath92 fluxes . again , since the average energies of @xmath21 and @xmath92 are 15 and 24 mev respectively , this results in an enhanced @xmath21 event rate and a reduced @xmath92 rate at the detector .",
    "it is important to note that these flux mixings are energy independent .",
    "for example , the energy spectrum of a given neutrino flavour produced in the supernova is not altered during propagation ; however , its flavour content at the detector will depend on the extent of mixing .",
    "we shall now probe the quantitative effects of these mixings on the observed event rates .",
    "we first consider the case where there is no neutrino mixing .",
    "the largest contribution comes from the @xmath136 interaction , which has a cross - section proportional to the square of the antineutrino energy .",
    "this is shown in the left  hand part of fig .  1 , where the number of events , @xmath137 , in the k@xmath138 bin is plotted against the central values of the recoil electron energy in that bin .",
    "in comparison , the @xmath139 contribution is negligibly small .",
    "however , this is not the case with the @xmath140 contribution , which though small , may be measurable at , say , the large ( 32 kton ) superk detector .",
    "it can be seen , though , that the total rate is saturated by the proton interaction .",
    "neutrino mixing causes an increase in the high energy event rates , as can be seen from the right hand side of fig .  1 . here",
    ", we have used typical values for @xmath17 ( @xmath141 ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath142 ) ; this choice of @xmath17 maximises mixing effects .",
    "the other ( small - angle ) solution for @xmath17 is similar to the no - oscillation scenario shown on the left hand side of the figure .",
    "note that our three - flavour analysis precludes the choice @xmath143 .",
    "for example , the result that @xmath0 starts out as a pure @xmath144 mass eigenstate in the stellar core will not hold if @xmath145 .",
    "the corresponding results for @xmath0 events are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "while the no  mixing contributions are negligible , it is seen that there is a more than 10fold increase in the event rate due to scattering off oxygen .",
    "the low no  mixing rate was because the average @xmath0 energy is less than the threshold energy required for this reaction to proceed .",
    "mixing opens up this channel since there are now many more @xmath0 , originating as @xmath91 in the star , which are more energetic .",
    "since the backward peak in the @xmath146 cross - section is more pronounced for flux distributions at higher temperatures @xcite , it may be possible to separate these events from the bulk of the anti - electron neutrino events at the detector .    finally , we see from fig .",
    "3 that there is a low - energy enhancement of the @xmath91 and @xmath92 rates upon mixing .",
    "their contribution , however , is still small , of the order of the @xmath147 elastic scattering events . for comparison , all the contributions , with and without mixing ,",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that the proton absorption events are the largest , independent of mixing .",
    "however , it is the @xmath146 events which are most sensitive to the amount of mixing , and are likely to be most important in furthering our understanding of neutrino oscillations in vacuum and matter .",
    "we recall that the proton absorption events are isotropic , the scattering off oxygen is backward enhanced , while the elastic scattering on electrons is mostly forward peaked .",
    "in fact , even the elastic @xmath0 and @xmath91 ( including antineutrinos ) events may be separated based on angular resolution @xcite .",
    "hence , it is likely that a nearby supernova explosion ( at a distance of about 10 kpc , say ) can yield information _ independently _ on the various neutrino flavours , @xmath0 , @xmath21 and @xmath91 .",
    "we have therefore shown the total contribution from each of these flavours , with and without neutrino mixing , in fig .",
    "5 . for a 32 kton detector such as superk",
    ", this translates to a total event rate of 12,235 events with mixing as opposed to 9,871 events without mixing , a 25% increase , with individual channels contributing as shown in table  1 .",
    "note that the thermal flux distribution , while agreeing with the numerical model of ref .",
    "@xcite at lower energies , overestimates the flux at larger energies .",
    "hence , the number of events at high energies may be overestimated in this model .",
    "however , we emphasise that the _ relative _ increase , with and without oscillation , remains the same .",
    "we now briefly discuss these results in relation to the supernova sn1987a .",
    "recall that the supernova , which was 55 kpc away , was detected by kii , which was a 2.14 kton ( fiducial volume ) water cerenkov detector ; the corresponding results for this can therefore be obtained from our analysis by multiplying the results by a factor of @xmath148 . however , since kii mostly detected low energy events , we have now included the detector efficiency @xcite in our analysis .",
    "the event rate is determined entirely by the @xmath149 events .",
    "since kii measured the time dependence of the spectrum , we have shown our results for the event rate as a function of time in fig .",
    "the figure on the left hand side of fig .",
    "6 shows the event rates for energies from @xmath150 mev , which is the energy range in which kii made observations ; the dotted curve indicates the contribution in the absence of mixing .",
    "it is seen that mixing marginally decreases the event rate while it almost doubles the rate for events with energies @xmath151 mev as can be seen from the figure on the right .",
    "this separation has been done since the thermal fermi - dirac distribution that we use overestimates the flux at larger ( neutrino ) energies due to a very large high - energy tail compared to the corresponding numerical model @xcite , while agreeing quite well at lower energies , @xmath152 mev .",
    "this is particularly true for the event rate at early times ; hence our high energy predictions may be overestimated by a factor of 4 or more .",
    "note , however , that even if the absolute spectrum is overestimated by the model we have used , the results we had shown earlier contrast the relative differences with and without mixing and still hold .",
    "finally , the model also predicts that high energy events are most likely to occur at early times in the supernova explosion .",
    "this is not inconsistent with the observations of kii @xcite .    to summarise",
    ", a great deal of the physics of neutrino mixing and the effects of dense matter in neutrino propagation may be tested from neutrinos emitted during supernova explosions . specifically , from the results summarised in table  1",
    ", we may conclude ,    1 .   the observed @xmath136 events are the largest in number as well as least sensitive to the mixing parameters .",
    "hence they provide a direct test of the supernova models .",
    "since the angular distribution of these events is isotropic , they may be used to set the overall normalisation .",
    "all the interactions involving electrons as targets are peaked in the forward direction ( in fact , for @xmath153 mev , more than 90% of them lie in a @xmath154 cone with respect to the supernova direction ) . in the absence of any mixing",
    ", there will also be a few events in the backward direction due to cc scattering on oxygen targets .",
    "as indicated in table  1 , the forward - backward asymmetry in the event distribution will be clearly marked .",
    "the main effect of mixing is then to produce a dramatic increase in the events involving oxygen targets . as remarked earlier",
    ", this will show up as a marked increase in the number of events in the backward direction with respect to the forward peaked events .",
    "the actual increase , however , will depend sensitively on a combination of both the mixing parameters as well as the supernova model .",

    "we show that the propagation is indeed adiabatic and the expressions given above provide a reasonably accurate description of the matter effects in the stellar interior .",
    "a few remarks about the eigenvalues , @xmath205 , are in order .",
    "note that the eigenvalues themselves are always positive definite for electron type neutrinos , whereas for muon type neutrinos or electron - antineutrinos , this is not always the case since @xmath41 is large and negative .",

    "@xmath209 few mev , the second term is small and may be neglected except when computing matter mixing angles . however , for neutrinos having energies of the order of tens of ev ( but still with @xmath210 ) , the two terms compete .",
    "since the sign of the second term changes depending on whether the particle scattering is a neutrino or an antineutrino , one may expect interesting phenomena when @xmath208 becomes negative .",
    "this may lead to the trapping of low - energy neutrinos .",
    "this phenomenon is unique to neutrinos produced in supernova explosions .",
    "while it is of little relevance to the detection of neutrinos on earth , it may have interesting astrophysical consequences .",
    "the dynamics of such neutrinos is under further investigation .",
    "the electron neutrino @xmath0 is produced in the core of the supernova in the mass eigenstate @xmath55 with a negligible admixture of the other two states .",
    "as the produced @xmath55 propagates outwards , it passes through variable density matter ( since the density inside the stellar core decreases monotonically outwards ) .",
    "such a propagation may in general induce the presence of other mass eigenstates ( since they are no longer eigenstates of the hamiltonian ) by the time the neutrino exits the star and reaches the detector .",

    ", the non - adiabaticity parameter evaluates to @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the radius at which the higher resonance occurs , i.e. , when @xmath224 . using the explicit expression for @xmath37",
    ", the resonant density is given by @xmath225 where @xmath32 is in ev@xmath46 and @xmath226 mev ) . here",
    "@xmath227 is the electron fraction in the matter . for @xmath228 , as preferred by solar and atmospheric neutrino data , and a typical detected neutrino energy of @xmath229 mev , the resonant density is @xmath230 gm / cc .",
    "this determines the resonant radius , @xmath223 for a given value of @xmath18 .",
    "if the angle @xmath18 is indeed small , as indicated by chooz @xcite , this implies @xmath231 which evaluates to 2050 thousand kilometres for @xmath232 mev ( @xmath233 ) .",
    "the non - adiabaticity parameter is then given by ( for @xmath223 in km ) , @xmath234 since @xmath223 is large , it is clear that @xmath213 is large unless @xmath18 is very small .",
