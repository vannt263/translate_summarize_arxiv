    "charge - density - wave ( cdw ) behavior occurs in a wide variety of different materials .",
    "peierls@xcite originally showed the instability of a one - dimensional metal to a distortion with a unit cell twice as large as in the uniform phase , that opens an insulating gap at the fermi level .",
    "since then , cdw behavior has been seen in many different materials and in higher dimensions as well . still , the precise origin of cdw behavior in real materials is controversial@xcite  is it arising from electron - phonon interactions and a softening phonon or from a purely electronic instability in the static charge susceptibility or via an instability driven by the electron - phonon coupling ?",
    "we do not investigate that question here , but instead focus on the behavior in the nonequilibrium state .",
    "recently , nonequilibrium photoelectron pump - probe experiments have been carried out for a number of different cdw systems , with both valence electron photoemission@xcite and core - hole photoemission@xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the charge density wave material is pumped with an infrared laser pulse and displays nonequilibrium melting of the cdw state , which is illustrated by a filling in of the gap in the photoemission spectrum , while the system still retains its modulation of the electronic charge in the ordered cdw phase .",
    "this phenomena has already been examined with an exactly solvable model@xcite .",
    "the simplest model for a cdw insulator is to start with a system that can be divided into two sublattices , called @xmath0 and @xmath1 and having hopping only between the two sublattices .",
    "then we pick an on - site energy to be equal to @xmath2 on the @xmath0 sublattice and 0 on the @xmath1 sublattice .",
    "the equilibrium hamiltonian becomes @xmath3 here @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the creation and annihilation operators for a spinless fermion at site @xmath6 .",

    "the electrons are allowed to hop between nearest neighbors with a hopping matrix @xmath11 , which is a real and symmetric matrix that equals @xmath12 for @xmath6 and @xmath13 nearest neighbors and vanishes otherwise .",
    "when this hamiltonian is diagonalized ( see below ) , it forms two bands , so filling the electrons halfway ( one electron per two lattice sites ) , yields an insulating phase . because the site energy is fixed and never varies , the cdw order is always frozen in , and remains for all finite temperatures . while this might seem like an extreme limit",
    ", it should describe the behavior of experimentally studied cdw systems for short times , before the phonons are able to relax the system and reduce or eliminate the effective site energy ( which arose from the phonon distortion in the ordered phase ) .",
    "nevertheless , because this model can be solved exactly , it provides an interesting limit for other ( more accurate ) model calculations and displays interesting nonequilibrium behavior that has a number of nontrivial results .",

    "ii , we develop the formalism for the exact solution of the nonequilibrium problem . in section iii",
    ", we present our solutions for the bloch oscillations and nonequilibrium density of states , and we conclude in section iv .",

    "even though one might have expected the dos to instantly switch between the equilibrium and the nonequilibrium results as the field is turned on , since the dos measures the quantum mechanical states of the system , they must evolve from one result to the other continuously and this occurs slowly in this case because the equilibrium dos has long tails in the time domain due to the inverse square root singularity at the upper or lower band edge .",

    "this `` mixed '' green s function interpolates between the equilibrium and nonequilibrium steady state dos .",

    "one should note that due to the long tail in time for the equilibrium green s function , it becomes difficult to think of the local dos as being defined at a specific average time only .",

    "one can still see a wannier - stark - like ladder in these systems , but the peaks no longer occur just at the bloch frequencies , but are shifted , and also broadened , as we expect them to be . clearly the behavior of the dos is complex , and depends in a nontrivial way on the site energy @xmath2 and the field amplitude @xmath164 .",

    "this formalism works and is exact in any spatial dimension . for concreteness , and to compare to work done for interacting systems , we solved the problem in infinite dimensions on the hypercubic lattice .",
    "we used this formalism to study the bloch - oscillation problem given by the question of how does this system evolve after a large amplitude field is turned on at @xmath165 .",
    "we found that the current undergoes a transient response before settling into a steady state - like behavior for longer times , but the time trace of the current versus time is not governed solely by the bloch frequency but shows more complex structure and behavior .",
    "we also examined the local dos to see how the wannier - stark - ladder physics was modified by the gap in the spectrum .",
    "we found complex behavior here as well , which is not determined solely by any simple rule for how the system will evolve , although we did find a propensity for minibands to form with gaps at half - odd integer multiples of the field amplitude .",
    "finally , we examined whether the fluctuation - distribution theorem holds at long times , and we found that typically , as one might expect , the systems do not follow a thermal distribution , but show a markedly athermal distribution of states .",
    "the work we presented here will be challenging to observe in cdw systems in condensed matter , but they could be seen more easily in cold atom systems on double - well optical lattices , where this model is a natural model to describe the behavior of those systems . while the local dos can not be measured , analogs to photoemission experiments are possible , as is the possibility of measuring the number of particles in each band as a function of time",

    "<S> charge - density - wave systems have a static modulation of the electronic charge at low temperatures when they enter an ordered state . while they have been studied for decades in equilibrium , it is only recently that they have been examined in nonequilibrium with time - resolved studies . here </S>",
    "<S> , we present the exact solution for the nonequilibrium response of electrons ( in the simplest model for a charge density wave ) when the system is placed under a strong dc electric field . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to examine the formation of driven bloch oscillations and how the presence of a current modifies the nonequilibrium density of states . </S>"
