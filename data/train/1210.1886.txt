    "redshifted  21-cm provides a probe of the most abundant element in the universe , through surveys which are not subject to the flux limitations of optical surveys . in absorption ,",
    "21-cm probes the cool component of the neutral gas , which is the reservoir of raw material ultimately responsible for all star formation .",
    "furthermore , the strength of the absorption depends only upon the column density of the absorber and the flux of the background source , making the 21-cm transition potentially detectable up to redshifts of @xmath4 , where the ionosphere begins to affect the @xmath5 mhz radio waves .    despite this , redshifted 21-cm absorption is currently rare , with only 78 absorbers known at @xmath6 , 80% of which are detected at @xmath7 .",
    "much of this is due to the past availability of interference free bands at low frequencies , although there are additional selection effects at play :    * for absorbers _ intervening _ the sight - lines to more distant radio sources , the 60% detection rate at @xmath8 , compared to 20% at @xmath9 , in systems known to have high hydrogen column densities absorption systems ( dlas ) , with neutral hydrogen column densities of @xmath10 .",
    "] , can be attributed to the geometry effects introduced by an expanding universe , where the coverage of the background flux is systematically lower at redshifts of @xmath0 @xcite . * for absorbers _ associated _ with the radio source itself , the detection rate at @xmath7 is 40% , compared to 17% at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this is believed to be due to the higher redshifts biasing towards the most ultra - violet luminous objects , where the intense flux ionises the gas .",
    "specifically , associated 21-cm absorption has _ never _ been detected where the @xmath11    continuum luminosity of the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) exceeds @xmath12 ( @xcite and recently confirmed by @xcite ) . at these frequencies ( @xmath13 hz ) and above , the photons have enough energy to excite the hydrogen beyond the ground state , so that it can not absorb in 21-cm .",
    "@xcite have extended this to the ionising ( @xmath14  ) radiation and show that a similar ( i.e. @xmath15 ) cut - off also applies .",
    "the large fraction of non - detections at high redshift are therefore due to the flux limited nature of the optical surveys selecting the brightest objects , where the observed - frame optical light is rest - frame ultra - violet , in which all of the gas is believed to be ionised @xcite .",
    "in order to find the neutral gas missing from high redshift agn , we suggest that high redshift 21-cm surveys should be directed towards the most optically faint sources .",
    "we have therefore embarked on an observing campaign of objects selected by faint optical magnitudes . as discussed in @xcite , our usual source catalogue ,",
    "the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample ( phfs , @xcite ) , yielded only two sources with faint blue magnitudes ( @xmath16 ) in the 90-cm band ( @xmath17 ) curve ( figure 5 of @xcite ) , gives @xmath16 for @xmath18  at these redshifts . ] , both of which have been previously searched for in 21-cm @xcite .",
    "we therefore compiled all available radio catalogues , which give both redshifts and magnitudes , and selected those with @xmath19 magnitudes which indicate that @xmath20  at the given redshift ( fig .",
    "[ m - z ] ) .",
    "we further shortlisted those in which 21-cm is redshifted into the 290395 mhz band of the green bank telescope ( gbt ) or the uhf - low band ( 250460 mhz ) of the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) and which reached sufficiently high elevations at these locations , while having flux densities estimated to be @xmath21 jy at the redshifted 21-cm frequency .",
    "this gave eleven sources which we observed ( table  [ obs ] ) , eight of which were not completely ruined by rfi , and as seen from fig .",

    "however , this is based upon four limits to the turnover frequencies out of eight seds and , as warned by asurv , may be unreliable . , it is conceivable that seven of the turnover frequencies are limits .",
    "furthermore , the high redshift sources will also be subject to a higher mean turnover due to that fact that the lowest typical value , 74 mhz , is in the observed - frame , giving the high redshift sources higher upper limits in the rest - frame . ] in the case of the spectral indices , where there are no limits , we see that the spectra of our sample are significantly steeper than for the other sub - samples .",
    "thus , if the spectral index is a reliable tracer of the background source size , the fact that this sample consists almost exclusively of steep spectrum sources , indicating large radio source sizes , means that poor coverage of the background source can not be ruled out as the cause of the non - detections .",
    "note , however , for the `` uv luminous '' sources ( the 19 which lie above the @xmath53 cut - off , @xcite ) , the mean spectral index is close to that of the 21-cm detections , thus ruling out the same predisposition towards large radio sources being the cause of the non - detections .      although all of our sources were selected to have @xmath11    continuum luminosities below the critical value of @xmath12  ( fig .",
    "[ m - z ] ) , it is clear that the total ionising ( @xmath54  ) luminosity , @xmath55 , provides a much better measure of the ionising flux than a monochromatic value ( be it @xmath56 or @xmath57 , @xcite ) . in equilibrium ,",
    "the total ionising luminosity is related to the recombination of the atoms via @xcite , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the planck constant , giving the number of ionising photons per second . on the right hand side of the expression ,",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 are the proton and electron densities , respectively , @xmath62 the radiative recombination rate coefficient of hydrogen and @xmath63 is the extent of the ionisation ( the `` strmgren sphere '' ) . for a gas which decreases in density with increasing distance from the ionising source , @xcite show that @xmath64 for a finite ultra - violet luminosity and that for a large spiral this value is @xmath65 , thus explaining this critical luminosity above which 21-cm absorption has never been detected .    from the mean seds of all of the associated 21-cm searches ,",
    "the critical ionising photon rate arising from this luminosity is estimated to be @xmath66 s@xmath67 @xcite . from",
    "the polynomial fits ( see the appendix ) , we could determine photon rates for three of the targets presented here ( fig .",
    "[ seds ] ) , one of which is above the estimate of the critical value ( @xmath68 = 56.5 $ ] , cf .",
    "table  [ lums ] ) .",
    "applying fits to each of the seds , the highest photon rate which could be determined for a 21-cm detection is @xmath69 s@xmath67 , which is below or close to the photon rate of the three targets ( @xmath70 =   55.7 $ ] , see fig .",
    "[ 3-n ] ) .",
    "however , given that we have no estimates of the photon rates for the remaining five sources , from the previous estimates of the @xmath71  continuum luminosities ( table  [ lums ] ) , it is possible that several of these have rates lower than for the three for which we do have estimates .",
    "for instance , j0121 + 1320 has been detected in co emission @xcite , which may suggest a uv luminosity below the critical value , although further studies are required to find if this applies to the warm emitting molecular gas . while the monochromatic luminosities may not provide a reliable estimate of the photon rates , if , for the sake of argument , the remaining five sources do have ionising photon rates below the critical value , for a 40% detection rate ( sect .",
    "[ odl ] ) , the binomial probability of zero out of five detections is 0.078 .",
    "this is significant at @xmath72 , assuming gaussian statistics , and so not statistically important .",
    "recalling that a possible reason for the non - detections is that the targets have not been searched sufficiently deeply ( sect .",
    "[ odl ] ) , this significance could be lower , thus not requiring us to `` explain away '' all eight non - detections .",
    "lastly , given that @xmath73 s@xmath67 is sufficient to ionise all of the gas in a large spiral , photon rates lower than this will completely ionise gas disks of correspondingly smaller scale - lengths @xcite .",
    "the sample presented here is at more than double the look - back time of the majority of 21-cm detections ( fig .",
    "[ m - z ] ) and so if there is any evolution in galactic morphology , with a larger fraction of smaller galaxies at higher redshift @xcite , we may expect the value of the critical photon rate to be lower at the redshifts searched here , making the detection of 21-cm absorption all the more difficult .",
    "evolution may also play a rle in that if the molecular ( ) component constitutes a larger fraction of the gas at high redshift @xcite , lower relative column densities will make the  more difficult to detect .",
    "however , as seen from fig .",
    "[ m - z ] , 21-cm has already been detected at @xmath1 and , although molecular gas has been detected in emission in over 100 ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( see @xcite and references therein ) , searches for molecular absorption within the hosts of millimetre - loud sources have proved unfruitful @xcite . ) , these sources should be searched in the millimetre band to rule out the possibility of a high molecular fraction suppressing the atomic abundance ( if not already done so , although there are no published searches for molecular emission in the remaining targets ) .",
    "however , the cool absorbing molecular gas , rather than warm emitting component , may be expected to be the coincident with the cool atomic gas ( see @xcite and references therein ) . ]",
    "we have undertaken a survey for the hydrogen apparently missing in high redshift radio galaxies and quasars by selecting targets in which the optical magnitudes indicate that these are below the uv luminosity cut - off , above which all of the gas is ionised @xcite . despite this",
    ", there were no detections in the eight @xmath1 objects for which useful data were obtained . upon an examination of the spectral energy distributions of the targets , we suggest two possible reasons for this :    1 .",
    "due to our requirement of optically faint , radio - loud objects , for which their redshift placed them within the gbt and wsrt 90-cm bands , our sample was dominated by the ultra - steep spectrum sources of @xcite . by fitting radio seds to these , we find a mean spectral index of @xmath2 , which is significantly higher than @xmath74 and @xmath75 for the 21-cm detections and the remaining non - detections , respectively .",
    "this suggests that most of our targets may have extended radio emission , thus reducing the coverage of the background flux by the absorbing gas , lowering the effective sensitivity of our survey .",
    "although our magnitude selection predicted that all of the targets are below the critical luminosity of @xmath76 , those for which the ionising photon rate could be determined are above or close to @xmath69 ionising photons s@xmath67 , the highest value which can be determined for a 21-cm detection .",
    "however , the photon rate could only be estimated for three of the eight sources and their monochromatic @xmath11    continuum luminosities may nevertheless suggest that these are below the threshold . without sufficient blue / ultra - violet photometry ,",
    "this is , however , speculation .    although it is impossible at this time to determine which reason is main the culprit , note that the mean radio - band seds of the 19 sources for which @xmath77 , which initially highlighted a uv threshold , is no steeper than the seds of the 21-cm detections",
    "this suggests that a bias towards larger radio sources is not the cause of the exclusive non - detections for the uv luminous sample . also , presuming that the remaining five sources , for which the photon rate could not be determined , are below the threshold gives a detection rate ( 0 out of 5 ) which is not statistically significant , given the 40% chance of a detection at @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , at these redshifts we are probing look - back times more than double that of the @xmath7 sources and if there is a larger fraction of smaller galaxies at these epochs , the gas will be ionised at lower luminosities .",
    "for instance , the highest photon rate for which there exists a 21-cm detection ( @xmath78 s@xmath67 ) , is sufficient to fully ionise a gas distribution of scale - length of 1.6 kpc ( 50% that of a large spiral , @xcite ) , for @xmath79  @xcite . , a sixth of that found for a rate of @xmath80 ionising photons s@xmath67 , the critical value estimated by @xcite . ]",
    "if this is the case , objects even fainter than those targetted here are required to find the missing hydrogen at high redshift , a task perhaps best suited for blind surveys with the square kilometre array , where an optical redshift is not a prerequisite .    to conclude ,",
    "although we can not rule out the radio structure and other hitherto unforeseen high redshift effects as the source of the non - detections , the fact remains that @xmath54   photons ionise hydrogen and there exists a @xmath81 probability ( a @xmath82 significance ) of the exclusive non - detections above a given ionising photon rate arising by chance @xcite .",
    "this is conjunction with the fact that the critical rate observed is just sufficient to ionise all of the gas in a large galaxy , leaves little doubt that photoionsation of the gas by the active nucleus is a dominant issue in the search of neutral gas within the hosts of these objects .",
