    "generalized wallach spaces are a remarkable class of compact homogeneous spaces which were introduced in @xcite .",

    "let @xmath10 be the @xmath11-orthogonal complement to @xmath5 in @xmath4 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath10 is @xmath12-invariant ( and @xmath13-invariant , in particular ) .",
    "the module @xmath10 is naturally identified with the tangent space to @xmath1 at the point @xmath14 .",
    "every @xmath2-invariant riemannian metric on  @xmath1 generates an  @xmath12-invariant inner product on  @xmath10 and vice versa .",

    "there are many examples of these spaces , e.  g. the manifolds of complete flags in the complex , quaternionic , and cayley projective planes : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , which are known as _ wallach spaces _ ; the various khler @xmath22-spaces @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . the classification of generalized wallach spaces @xmath1 is obtained in @xcite , and the part for simple lie groups @xmath2 is also given in @xcite .",

    "in this section , we give a further study on @xmath0 satisfying @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "in particular we will prove theorem [ ems ] and theorem [ emsn ] .",
    "for this goal we get some more detailed information on some special sets in @xmath62 related to the normalized ricci flows on the spaces @xmath0 .",
    "in particular we prove      the intersection of the surface @xmath66 ^ 3 $ ] with the plane @xmath67 is a triangle with the vertices @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 and the point @xmath72 for @xmath73 . for any @xmath74 ,",
    "this intersection denoted by @xmath75 is a `` curvilinear triangle '' with the vertices on the singular `` edges '' of @xmath51 .",
    "obviously , @xmath75 is invariant under the group of symmetry of a usual triangle with the same vertices .",
    "now , let @xmath56 be a maximal usual triangle in @xmath75 ( in the plane @xmath76 , in particular ) with the same symmetry group as @xmath75 has .",
    "denote by @xmath57 the usual triangle ( in the plane @xmath76 ) with the same vertices as @xmath75 has .",
    "clearly , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 for @xmath80 ( see figure  [ singsur ] ) . in order to show the evolutions of these types of triangles , we reproduced the pictures in the planes @xmath76 with four values of the parameter @xmath81 ( see figure  [ curv1 ] and figure  [ curv2 ] ) .    in particular , if @xmath82 and @xmath83 , then the equation @xmath84 is @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",

    "hence the equation ( [ ih3 ] ) has three real roots .",
    "the first one is in @xmath97 , the second one is in @xmath98 , and the third one is in @xmath99 .    note that @xmath94 decreases for @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to prove that @xmath101 , hence @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , the point @xmath103 , but @xmath104 is a vertex of @xmath75 and @xmath57 . clearly the point @xmath104 does belong to the `` edge '' of @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath122 .",
    "clearly the function @xmath123 decreases on the interval @xmath124 $ ] and increases on the interval @xmath125 $ ] .",
    "then we have @xmath126 since @xmath127 . by proposition  [ prop1 ]",

    "since the function @xmath130 decreases on @xmath89 $ ] for @xmath131 $ ] ( since @xmath132 ) , we know that the inequality ( [ ih5 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath133 which is equivalent to @xmath134 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath135 .",
    "now , it suffices to apply proposition [ prop1 ] .",
    "obviously , if @xmath154 , the point @xmath151 is a vertex of @xmath155 ( because it is an unique point in this degenerate triangle ) . on the other hand , assume that @xmath116 and @xmath151 is a vertex of @xmath152 .",

    "hence , @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath159 since the discriminant is @xmath160 .                    from proposition [ prop1n ] and corollary [ cor4 ]",
    "we get that @xmath118 for @xmath135 and @xmath146 for @xmath182 .",
    "now , it suffices to apply theorem [ odomains ] , taking in mind that singular points for the normalized ricci flow are exactly invariant einstein metrics of fixed volume .    for @xmath142 , where @xmath183 , we get @xmath184 by ( [ singval2 ] ) and direct calculations . alternatively , it suffices to check that @xmath185 , see  ( [ equag2 ] )",

    "[ remim ] it is easy to check using of ( [ two_equat_sing1 ] ) that @xmath186 , the generalized wallach space with @xmath187 , has exactly three einstein metrics ( up to constant multiple ) for @xmath188 , whereas @xmath189 has unique ( up to a homothety ) einstein invariant metric . indeed , direct calculations show that there are the following einstein metrics @xmath190 up to a homothety : @xmath191 @xmath192 see details in @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the second and the third metrics are isometric ( in fact , one need only to permute @xmath193 and @xmath194 ) .",
