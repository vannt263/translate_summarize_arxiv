    "an important property of most quantum phase transitions studied to date in systems with a metallic fermi surface in spatial dimensions @xmath0 is that the critical field theory for the order parameter is a free gaussian theory @xcite .",
    "this result has its origin in the fact that the order parameters considered can be expressed as a fermion bilinears , and consequently the order parameter fluctuations are efficiently overdamped and suppressed by fermionic particle and hole excitations near the fermi surface .",
    "the temperature dependencies of physical observables near the quantum critical point have been perturbatively computed @xcite , and these can be understood as corrections to scaling@xcite at the gaussian critical point@xcite .",
    "the quantum and thermal fluctuations near quantum phase transitions in fermi systems have been used to interpret experiments in a variety of correlated electron materials . in the cuprate superconductors , the anomalous properties in the normal state",
    "have been described in terms of the proximity to a quantum phase transition associated with the onset of spin density wave ( sdw ) or charge density wave ( cdw ) order in a fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "however , the observed anomalous properties extend to quite high temperatures , and it would be preferable to explain these in theories with stronger non - linearities among the order parameter modes .",
    "further , many of the anomalous properties extend to the optimal doping regime where there is no strong evidence of a large correlation length of the sdw and cdw orders .",
    "this paper describes an alternative class of quantum critical points whose critical theories are non - gaussian , and which remain strongly coupled even in the presence of a fermi surface because they are below their upper critical dimension . only in such theories can the order parameter relaxation rate , and possibly the quasiparticle energy width ,",
    "be generically equal to @xmath1 times a universal numerical constant@xcite ( @xmath2 is the absolute temperature ) .",
    "examples of such quantum phase transitions abound in insulators and superconductors@xcite , and some of these have been used to explain low temperature properties of the cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "this paper will discuss transition in metals with a fermi surface , and so the possible regime of applicability is restricted to higher temperatures where superconductivity is absent",
    ".    our primary focus will be on a transition with a non - local `` topological '' order associated with certain defects in the sdw / cdw order",
    ". however , long - range sdw or cdw order will not be present on either side of the critical point . this transition ( shown in fig",
    ".  [ phase ] below ) is being offered as a candidate@xcite for a possible optimal doping quantum critical point @xcite in the cuprate superconductors .",
    "this proposal for the optimal doping quantum critical point must be distinguished from a conventional sdw ordering transition in a _",
    "superconductor _ discussed recently by one of us@xcite ; the latter transition occurs at lower doping concentrations ( near 1/8 ) and was used to predict and explain a number of recent _ low temperature _ neutron scattering and stm experiments .",
    "here we are interested in higher dopings and temperatures , where , as we have already noted , the correlation length of conventional sdw / cdw order is surely quite small , but , as we shall discuss below , correlations in a topological order may be far more robust .",
    "we also hope for applications of our theory in other correlated materials , like the heavy fermion systems , where many experiments are in disagreement with the conventional weakly coupled theories@xcite .",
    "in particular , we will show that the strongly - coupled critical points predict a scaling structure for physical observables which is quite similar to those proposed by schrder _",
    "@xcite related scaling structures are also known to appear near strongly - coupled spin glass quantum critical points , and this is reviewed in appendix  [ app : qsg ] .",
    "there is one simple route to obtaining a strongly coupled field theory in the presence of a fermi surface that has been discussed earlier @xcite : use restrictions from momentum conservation to prevent the order parameter from coupling linearly to low energy fermionic excitations .",
    "for example , a transition with the onset of sdw order at the wavevector @xmath3 , but the geometry of the fermi surface such that no two points on the fermi surface are separated by @xmath3 .",
    "in such a situation the order parameter excitations remain undamped , and the fermions appear to be innocuous bystanders to the transition",
    ". however , it turns out that the fermi surface can still be relevant for the structure of the critical theory in certain situations ; these effects are related to those that arise in the transitions we do discuss below , and so we defer discussion of this point until section  [ sec : sdw ] .    turning to transitions characterized by a non - local , ` topological ' order parameter , a situation that has been much discussed in the recent literature@xcite has the electron , @xmath4 , ( @xmath5 is a spin index ) fractionalize into a spinless charge @xmath6 boson , @xmath7 , and a neutral spin 1/2 fermion @xmath8 : @xmath9 this fractionalization transition",
    "is described by a @xmath10 gauge theory @xcite , and both @xmath7 and @xmath8 carry a unit gauge charge ; the physical fermion , @xmath4 , is , of course , gauge neutral .",
    "if we denote the @xmath10 gauge field by @xmath11 ( @xmath12 are site labels ) , then terms like @xmath13 will generically appear in the effective hamiltonian @xcite . in the fractionalized phase , where the fluctuations of @xmath11 are effectively quenched , this term is a bcs - like pairing of the @xmath8 fermions , and it implies that the fermi surface will generically be gapped out ( except possibly at special points if the pairing is anisotropic ) .",
    "consequently , this fractionalization transition does not provide us with a candidate quantum phase transition in the presence of a fermi surface , and we will not consider it further in this paper .",
    "the main focus of this paper shall be on a fractionalization transition that does less damage to the integrity of the electron : the electron ( and hence its fermi surface ) remains intact on both sides of the transition , but charge neutral collective modes ( in the particle - hole sector ) do fractionalize ; only at the quantum critical point , and in the associated non - zero temperature quantum critical region , is the electronic quasiparticle ill - defined .",
    "_ @xcite have recently given an appealing pictorial description of such a transition .",
    "a transition with closely related physical content was introduced in ref .  ; we will follow the latter approach here , and will describe the physical content and experimental motivation below in section  [ sec : op ] .",
    "there have also been earlier discussions of the fractionalization of order parameters in other physical contexts @xcite .    after introducing the order parameters in section  [ sec : op ] ,",
    "we write down and classify quantum field theories for the critical points in section  [ sec : qft ] .",
    "we pause briefly in section  [ sec : sdw ] to consider the conventional transitions mentioned above , in which the fermion bilinear order parameter is not damped by fermi surface excitations because of restrictions arising from momentum conservation , and show that it is described by field theories similar to those in section  [ sec : qft ] .",
    "the latter are subjected to a renormalization group analysis in section  [ sec : rg ] , and the physical implications of the results are noted in section  [ sec : phys ] .",
    "consider a correlated electronic system in two dimensions with enhanced sdw correlations at the wavevectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; these are vectors of equal length pointing along the @xmath16 and @xmath17 axes respectively .",
    "similar considerations apply to other choices for the ordering wavevectors , but we will focus on this case because it directly applies to the doped cuprates @xcite at doping concentrations above @xmath18 . we can write for the spin operator @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is a spatial co - ordinate , @xmath21 labels spin components , and @xmath22 is imaginary time ) : @xmath23 ; \\label{e1}\\ ] ] @xmath24 and @xmath25 are then the sdw order parameters . except of the case of two sublattice order ( @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) , these order parameters are complex numbers .",
    "concommitant with this sdw correlations , symmetry demands @xcite that there are also `` bond order '' correlations at half the wavelength : @xmath28 + \\ldots \\label{e2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there is an implied summation over the repeated spin index @xmath29 .",
    "the vector @xmath30 represents a bond ( say the nearest neighbor vector ) , we have assumed that @xmath24 does not vary significantly over the spatial distance @xmath30 , and the ellipses denote numerous other similar terms which can be deduced from ( [ e1 ] ) . for @xmath30 a nearest - neighbor vector , @xmath31 measures the modulations in the exchange energy , while for @xmath32 , @xmath33 measures the local charge density ( for the @xmath34-@xmath35 model the charge density is linearly related to the on - site @xmath36 ) .",
    "so , quite generally , the bond order parameters , @xmath37 , measure modulations in all observables invariant under spin rotations and time reversal ( such the electron kinetic , pairing , or exchange energies ) .",
    "the modulation in the total charge density may be strongly suppressed by the long - range coulomb interactions , but this suppression is not expected to apply to observables with @xmath38 .",
    "we will loosely refer to such bond order modulations as cdw order in this paper , but the caveats discussed in this paragraph must be kept in mind .",
    "now examine the structure of the effective potential , @xmath39 controlling fluctuations of @xmath40 ( parallel considerations apply implicitly in the remainder of this subsection to @xmath41 ) . on general symmetry grounds",
    "@xcite , this potential has the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 are phenomenological landau parameters , and there is again an implied summation over repeated spin indices @xmath46 . in the usual landau theory , the transition to the onset long - range sdw order happens when @xmath43 first becomes negative , and the minimum of the potential moves from @xmath47 to a non - zero value .",
    "the theory of the critical point then accounts for fluctuations of @xmath40 about the value of @xmath48 , and these allow for strong fluctuations in both the amplitudes and the phases of the three complex fields @xmath49 .    in much of the discussion on stripe physics in the literature ( see _",
    "e.g. _ ref .  )",
    ", the physical picture advocated for the onset of long range sdw / cdw ( or `` stripe '' ) order is quite different .",
    "as one decreases the doping from a fermi liquid towards a mott insulator , initial local stripe - like correlations form , the the orientation and phase of these regions changes from point to point ; only when these locally ordered regions align with each other , is there long range sdw / cdw order . in terms of our order parameter formulation",
    ", this means that locally the amplitude @xmath50 first becomes large , and that long range order develops subsequently upon alignment of the orientation and phases of @xmath40 .    in the familiar @xmath51 field theory of a",
    "_ real _ vector order parameter , this change in perspective from a `` soft - spin '' landau theory ( with strong amplitude fluctuations ) to a `` hard - spin '' perspective ( with amplitude fluctuations quenched ) does not make a fundamental difference in the physics being considered .",
    "the orientation fluctuations in the hard - spin approach are described by a non - linear @xmath52 model , whose critical properties can be analyzed by expansion away the lower critical dimension .",
    "conversely , the soft - spin approach leads to an expansion away from the upper critical dimension .",
    "however , these are merely complementary approaches to the same critical point , and the quantum numbers of the excitations in the phases flanking the critical point are the same in both approaches ; indeed a @xmath53 expansion ( @xmath54 is the number of field components ) can interpolate between the soft - spin and hard - spin theories , and also between the upper and lower critical dimensions @xcite .    for the present situation with a _ complex _",
    "vector order parameter the situation is dramatically different , and there is a fundamental difference between the soft - spin and hard - spin approaches to fluctuations implied by the effective potential ( [ vphi ] ) .",
    "the key difference is that not all order parameter configurations with a fixed @xmath55 are physically equivalent , and they can not all be rotated into each other by a symmetry transformation .",
    "a minimization of ( [ vphi ] ) at fixed @xmath56 shows two distinct classes of minima , chosen by the sign of @xmath45 ; their most general form is : @xmath57 by inserting into ( [ e1 ] ) , it is easy to see that ( i ) describes a spiral sdw for which the charge order in ( [ e2 ] ) vanishes , while ( ii ) is a collinear sdw with a modulation in the length of the spin as a function of @xmath58 , and a concommitant charge order .",
    "all experimental indications @xcite are that the spin fluctuations in the cuprates are always of the form ( ii ) .",
    "it therefore seems physically reasonable to impose the amplitude constraint implied by ( ii ) at an early stage , and to examine the theory associated with @xmath59 in the limit of large and negative @xmath45 ( stability requires @xmath60 ) .",
    "this last constraint is the more formal statement of the physical requirement that the spin and charge ordering is `` stripe - like '' .    as has been discussed in ref .",
    ", the imposition of the limit @xmath61 at the outset leads to a theory for phase and orientation fluctuations with a non - trivial structure that is very naturally described by a @xmath10 gauge theory . with the parameterization ( ii ) in ( [ ab ] ) , and for fixed @xmath62 , the order parameter @xmath49 takes values in the space @xmath63 , where the @xmath64 pertains to the orientation of @xmath65 , the @xmath66 is the phase factor @xcite @xmath67 , while the all - important @xmath10 quotient accounts for the invariance of @xmath40 under @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we can define global actions @xcite for single - valued fields @xmath65 and @xmath67 only at the cost of introducing a @xmath10 gauge field @xmath70 . a simple phenomenological form for the spatial terms in such",
    "an action is @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath12 are lattice sites , and @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 are coupling constants that vary with doping .",
    "the @xmath10 gauge invariance ensures that all physical properties are invariant under the @xmath10 gauge transformation @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the point defects associated with order parameter space @xmath63 were analyzed in ref .  , and a fundamental role is played by the `` stripe dislocation '' , sketched in fig  [ dislocation ] , which is a half - vortex in the angular field @xmath78 .",
    "( see ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ ab ] ) ) with @xmath79 containing a half vortex . as noted below ( [ e2 ] ) @xmath80 should not be literally interpreted as the electron charge density , and the modulation about could be associated with _",
    "e.g. _ the exchange per link .",
    "the quantum phase transitions discussed in this paper involve a transition from a fermi liquid state in which these dislocations proliferate to one in which they are suppressed ; there is no long - range spin or charge density wave order in either state ( see also fig .",
    "[ phase]).,width=240 ]    this vortex also carries a @xmath10 gauge flux of @xmath81 , as is easily seen from ( [ z2flux ] ) .",
    "we are now in a position to introduce our candidate transition for strongly coupled quantum criticality in the presence of a fermi surface .",
    "begin in a fermi liquid state , with only short range spin and charge order correlations : @xmath82 , @xmath83 ( @xmath43 in ( [ vphi ] ) is large and positive , @xmath84 , @xmath73 in ( [ z2flux ] ) are not large ) and only a small core energy for the stripe dislocations , which therefore proliferate .",
    "the dislocation core energy is controlled by the maxwell term for the @xmath10 gauge field , @xmath74 , and a small value of @xmath74 implies that the @xmath10 gauge field is in its confining state . in this state , the strong fluctuations of the @xmath10 gauge field `` bind '' the @xmath85 and @xmath86 fluctuations together , and the appropriate collective excitation is the conventional field @xmath40 itself , as it appears in ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "the single @xmath40 collective mode therefore describes both the sdw fluctautions ( via [ e1 ] ) ) and the bond order / cdw fluctuations ( via ( [ e2 ] ) ) .",
    "now increase the dislocation core energy by increasing @xmath74 , while keeping @xmath43 reasonably large ( or @xmath84 , @xmath73 small ) : this will decrease the number of stripe dislocations but still maintain @xmath87 , @xmath88 . in the cuprates",
    "we imagine that the increase in @xmath74 is associated with the decrease in carrier concentration towards the mott insulator . at a critical value of @xmath89 ,",
    "the @xmath10 gauge theory undergoes a transition into a deconfined state in which the stripe dislocations are suppressed .",
    "the transition at @xmath90 is the focus of interest in this paper . in this deconfined state ,",
    "the @xmath65 and @xmath67 fluctuations become independent collective excitations : _",
    "i.e. _ the single spin / charge collective mode , @xmath40 , has _",
    "fractionalized _ into two independent modes .",
    "the bond order , ( [ e2 ] ) , fluctuations are now given by the ` square ' of the @xmath91 collective mode , while the spin fluctuations , ( [ e1 ] ) , are the product of the @xmath65 and @xmath92 collective modes .",
    "we reiterate that there is no long range spin or charge density wave order on either side of this fractionalization transition , and it is entirely associated with the suppression of the defects in fig  [ dislocation ] ; see fig  [ phase ] .",
    "is the one studied in this paper .",
    "the phases on both sides of @xmath89 have well defined electronic quasiparticles near a fermi surface and no long range spin or charge order ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) .",
    "the order parameters @xmath95 are defined in section  [ sec : qft ] : these are ising order parameters dual to the @xmath10 gauge theory . the phase on the right is a conventional fermi liquid ; that on the left is a fermi liquid with local stripe correlations with random phases and spin orientations , and a ` topological rigidity ' associated with the suppression of stripe dislocations .",
    "in the application to the cuprates , the horizontal axis represents increasing doping and the critical point is near optimal doping .",
    "states with long range spin or charge density wave order do appear at smaller doping but these have not been shown .",
    "the phase transition at @xmath90 should be distinguished from the conventional sdw ordering transition in a superconductor ; this occurs at lower doping and was used recently by one of us @xcite to predict and explain the results of neutron scattering and stm experiments.,width=288 ]    at dopings lower than those shown in fig  [ phase ] , the cuprates possess phases with a variety of possible long range orders ( _ e.g. _ sdw or cdw ) which were reviewed in ref .  .",
    "these transitions are associated with conventional order parameters , and we will not consider them in this paper , as theories are already available in the literature .",
    "we are interested in describing the universal properties of the transition at @xmath90 .",
    "these turn out to be controlled by two distinct characteristics of the electronic system .",
    "( _ i _ ) tetragonal or orthorhombic crystal symmetry : with tetragonal symmetry we have to simultaneously consider the separate @xmath10 gauge theories associated with fractionalization transitions in both @xmath40 and @xmath41 . with orthorhombic symmetry , only one of these will be selected ( the `` stripes '' have a preferred direction ) .",
    "( _ ii _ ) presence or absence of long - range coulomb interactions : as we argue below , an important coupling of the critical @xmath10 gauge degrees of freedom to the fermions arises from long - wavelength deformations of the shape of the fermi surface . as is well known , in the presence of long - range coulomb interactions the `` dilatational '' mode , involving local changes in the area of the fermi surface , is strongly suppressed . for completeness",
    "we will also consider the case of fermions with only short - range interactions ( perhaps the coulomb interactions have been screened by a metallic gate ) , where the coupling to the dilatational mode has to be included .    with these two criteria , four distinct categories emerge , which we label a , b , c , d , as summarized in table  [ table ] .",
    ".[table ] classification of quantum field theories . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we will describe these cases in the subsections below .",
    "we begin with case a , for which the critical theory has the simplest form .",
    "as we noted in section  [ sec : op ] , the transition at @xmath90 is described by a @xmath10 gauge theory .",
    "we know that the pure 2 + 1 dimensional @xmath10 gauge theory is dual a 2 + 1 dimensional ising model@xcite ; we represent this ising order parameter by a real scalar field @xmath96 . for now , we neglect the independent @xmath10 gauge theory associated with @xmath41 , because orthorhombic symmetry has oriented all the spin and charge density waves along @xmath49 .",
    "the action for @xmath97 in the vicinity of the transition is the familiar field theory for the ising critical point : @xmath98 ; \\label{sx}\\ ] ] we have chosen the spatial units so that the velocity of @xmath96 excitations is unity in both directions , @xmath99 is a quartic non - linearity , and the quadratic coupling @xmath100 is the tuning parameter across the transition .",
    "the field @xmath96 can be viewed as the creation / annihilation operator for the dislocations : @xmath96 is condensed in the confining phase where the dislocations proliferate , and @xmath96 has short - range correlations in the deconfined phase where dislocations are suppressed .    in principle , we also need to account for the `` matter '' fields @xmath78 , @xmath85 in ( [ z2flux ] ) near this confinement transition .",
    "closely related @xmath10 gauge models have been considered in the literature@xcite , and it has been established that their fluctuations do not change the universality class of the transition .",
    "their presence does modify the effective couplings in ( [ sx ] ) , but the confinement transition continues to be described by the ising field theory ( [ sx ] ) all along the phase boundary .",
    "the main question we need to address here is the coupling between @xmath101 and the electronic excitations near the fermi surface ; the gapless excitations near the fermi surface have the potential of inducing long - range interactions which are more destructive than the matter fields in ( [ z2flux ] ) .",
    "the electrons _ do not _ carry any ising gauge charges , and couple to degrees of freedom of interest here only via the bilinears in ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) : @xmath102 where @xmath103 are the spin pauli matrices .",
    "we now imagine integrating out @xmath40 and generating terms which couple the electrons to the @xmath10 gauge degrees of freedom .",
    "the electrons are gauge singlets , and so can only couple to the physical @xmath10 gauge flux : the simplest such coupling is one in which the coupling @xmath74 in ( [ z2flux ] ) becomes @xmath104 dependent via its dependence on the local fermion bilinears @xmath105 where the ellipses represent terms with higher derivatives ; we have to include all such terms because the typical electron momentum is of order the fermi momentum , and this is not small . upon performing the duality transition to the ising field @xmath96",
    ", the mapping applies to @xmath106 , the co - efficient of @xmath107 , via its dependence upon @xmath74 , and this is also noted in ( [ kmap ] ) .",
    "we can now integrate over the fermionic degrees of freedom and examine the structure of the terms which modify @xmath108 : it is not difficult to see that apart from the modification of the numerical values of the couplings in ( [ sx ] ) , all such terms are formally irrelevant .",
    "the leading non - analytic terms induced by the low energy fermionic excitations arise from long wavelength deformations of the fermi surface : in the presence of long - range coulomb interactions , all such excitations allowed by symmetry to couple to @xmath107 are suppressed .",
    "so we reach the important conclusion that the critical theory for case a is specified by ( [ sx ] ) .",
    "there is one important caveat to this conclusion that deserves highlighting .",
    "our analysis has neglected topological berry phase terms that could be present in the coupling between @xmath96 , the fermions , and the @xmath10 gauge field @xmath11 .",
    "similar phase factors do arise in other analyses of @xmath10 gauge theories @xcite .",
    "we leave the study of this issue to future work , and restrict our attention here to couplings associated with ( [ kmap ] ) .",
    "the higher tetragonal symmetry has two important consequences : we have two consider fractionalization in both @xmath40 and @xmath41 simultaneously , and distortions of the fermi surface with @xmath109 symmetry do couple to the critical degrees of the freedom even in the presence of long - range coulomb interactions .",
    "there are now two dual ising fields , @xmath96 and @xmath110 , associated with the independent @xmath10 gauge fields in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions ; simple symmetry considerations show that @xmath108 in ( [ sx ] ) is replaced by @xmath111 ; \\label{sxy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for simplicity , we have neglected a possible difference in the velocity of the @xmath97 modes in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 directions .",
    "the critical properties of the theory @xmath112 are well understood @xcite : they are described by a stable fixed point with @xmath113 and a global o(2 ) ( or xy ) symmetry of rotations between @xmath95 .",
    "the fundamental new phenomenon here is that low energy deformations of the fermi surface destabilize the critical point just noted .",
    "although long - range coulomb interactions do suppress a local uniform dilatational change in the fermi surface , they do not suppress shape deformations which preserve the local volume .",
    "in particular , the tetragonal symmetry allows an oscillation of the fermi surface with @xmath109 ( or @xmath114 ) symmetry which has singular contributions at low energy , as has been emphasized recently by oganesyan _",
    "_ @xcite ; moreover , by symmetry , this deformation will couple linearly to @xmath115 . integrating the fermi surface deformations out by a standard procedure @xcite , we obtain the following non - analytic term in the effective action : @xmath116 the @xmath117 factor is the standard density of states of long - wavelength fermi surface oscillations in dimensions @xmath118 . a simple scaling argument",
    "now gives the scaling dimension of the coupling @xmath119 at the @xmath113 fixed point of @xmath112 .",
    "the @xmath117 factor implies that ( [ l5 ] ) couples @xmath120 to itself at distinct spacetime points , which precludes any additional operator renormalization ; consequently @xmath121 = d+1 - 2 \\mbox{dim } [ \\phi_x^2 - \\phi_y^2 ] ; \\label{scale1}\\ ] ] here and henceforth we will state such scaling dimensions for general spatial dimensions @xmath122 , although our interest is in @xmath123 .",

    ", we obtain @xmath131 = 0.52 > 0 $ ] .",
    "so we have established our earlier claim that @xmath109 deformations of the fermi surface constitute a relevant perturbation .",
    "it is now necessary to extend the renormalization group to include contributions higher order in @xmath119 .",
    "however , a simple one - loop analysis shows that this is not a stable procedure @xcite : at order @xmath132 we generate additional quartic terms which have a different @xmath133 , @xmath134 dependence than that in ( [ l5 ] ) , and new relevant terms are generated at each successive order .",
    "the solution to this conundrum is to introduce a new real scalar field , @xmath135 , as a hubbard - stratonovich decoupling of ( [ l5 ] ) : this field will be a measure of the amplitude of @xmath109 deformations of the fermi surface .",
    "note that we expect @xmath136 , and so to make the hubbard - stratonovich transformation positive definite , it is necessary to subtract a @xmath137 term before decoupling , and to compensate for this by corresponding changes to @xmath99,@xmath138 . in this manner",
    "we get the action @xmath139 our final effective action for case b is @xmath140 . in obtaining @xmath141",
    "we have expanded the coefficient of @xmath142 for small @xmath143 , and rescaled @xmath135 to make the co - efficient of the analytic @xmath142 term unity .",
    "we now have two new coupling constants , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , and it can be checked that @xmath136 implies @xmath146 .",
    "further , at the fixed points of @xmath112 , we will show in section  [ rgb ] that @xmath147= \\mbox{dim}[\\lambda_5]$ ] .",
    "the most important property of @xmath148 is that this action is stable under renormalization , and no new relevant terms are generated at any order .",
    "consequently , it can be subjected to a standard field - theoretic renormalization group analysis , and this will be presented in section  [ sec : rg ] .      the analysis of the remaining cases is a straightforward generalization of the discussion in section  [ b ] .    as in case",
    "a , the orthorhombic symmetry implies that we need only one ising field @xmath96 .",
    "however , because of the absence of long - range coulomb interactions , dilatational changes in the local fermi surface volume with full lattice symmetry do carry large low energy spectral weight .",
    "we measure these changes by the real scalar field @xmath149 , and obtain its effective action @xmath150 the effective action for case c is now @xmath151 .",

    "this section makes a brief detour to a separate class of quantum phase transitions mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] : those with conventional order parameters which do not couple linearly to low energy excitations on the fermi surface .",

    "further , we assume that the values of @xmath161 are such that they can not connect any two points on the fermi surface ; consequently the @xmath162 fluctuations are undamped and the quantum critical modes are strongly coupled .",

    "we have assumed that the strongly relevant `` mass '' term @xmath106 has been tuned to its critical value , and are examining above only the flow within this critical manifold .",
    "the first of the equations in ( [ rg1 ] ) is the most important : it is an exact equation ( although the values of @xmath174 and @xmath175 do have corrections at higher order ) which follows from the fact that there are no loop corrections to the non - analytic term with coefficient @xmath145 in the effective action .",
    "first , let us examine ( [ rg1 ] ) in the subspace with @xmath183 , where the long - range forces associated with the fermi surface are absent . the results in appendix  [ rg1 ] ) show that @xmath184 independent of @xmath180 , and @xmath185 ; here @xmath186 is a scheme - dependent constant whose value does not effect the physical properties .",
