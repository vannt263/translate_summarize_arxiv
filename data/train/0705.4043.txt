    "although general relativity ( gr ) passes all precision tests with flying colors @xcite , there remain some puzzling experimental issues , notably the fact that the universe seems to be filled with about 72% of dark energy and 24% of dark matter , only 4% of its energy content being made of ordinary baryonic matter @xcite .",
    "dark energy , a fluid whose negative pressure is close to the opposite of its energy density , would be responsible for the present accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "dark matter , a pressureless and noninteracting component of matter detected only by its gravitational influence , is suggested by several experimental data , notably the flat rotation curves of clusters and galaxies  @xcite .",
    "another experimental issue is the anomalous extra acceleration @xmath0 towards the sun that the two pioneer spacecrafts exhibited between 30 and 70 au @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "actually , none of these issues contradicts gr nor newtonian gravity directly .",
    "indeed , dark energy may be understood as the existence of a tiny cosmological constant @xmath1 , or as a scalar field ( called quintessence ) slowly rolling down a potential @xcite .",
    "many candidates of dark matter particles have also been predicted by different theoretical models ( notably the class of neutralinos , either light or more massive , occurring in supersymmetric theories ; see e.g. @xcite ) , and numerical simulations of structure formation have obtained great successes while incorporating such a dark matter ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . [",
    "it remains however to explain why @xmath2 is so small but nonzero , and why the dark energy and dark matter densities happen to be today of the same order of magnitude .",
    "] the pioneer anomaly seems more problematic , but the two spacecrafts are identical and were not built to test gravity , therefore one must keep cautious in interpreting their data .",
    "a dedicated mission would be necessary to confirm the existence of such an anomalous acceleration .",
    "nevertheless , these various issues , considered simultaneously , give us a hint that newton s law might need to be modified at large distances , instead of invoking the existence of several dark fluids .",
    "to avoid the dark matter hypothesis , milgrom  @xcite proposed in 1983 such a phenomenological modification , which superbly accounts for galaxy rotation curves  @xcite ( although galaxy clusters anyway require some amount of dark matter ) , and automatically recovers the tully - fisher law  @xcite @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 denotes the baryonic mass of a galaxy , and @xmath5 the asymptotic circular velocity of visible matter in its outer region ) .",
    "the norm @xmath6 of a particle s acceleration is assumed to be given by its newtonian value @xmath7 when it is greater than a universal constant @xmath8 , but to read @xmath9 in the small - acceleration regime @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the gravitational acceleration should now read @xmath11 at large distances , instead of the usual @xmath12 law .",
    "various attempts have been made to derive such a modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) from a consistent relativistic field theory .",
    "the main aim of the present paper is to examine them critically , by underlining their generic difficulties and how some models managed to solve them .",
    "three classes of difficulties may actually be distinguished : ( i )  theoretical ones , namely whether the proposed model derives from an action principle , is stable and admits a well - posed cauchy problem ; ( ii )  experimental ones , in particular whether solar - system and binary - pulsar tests are passed , and whether the predicted light deflection by galaxies or haloes is consistent with weak - lensing observations ; and ( iii )  `` esthetical '' ones , i.e. , whether the proposed model is natural enough to be considered as predictive , or so fine - tuned that it almost becomes a fit of experimental data .",
    "these different classes of difficulties are anyway related , because fine - tuning is often necessary to avoid an experimental problem , and because some tunings sometimes hide serious theoretical inconsistencies .",
    "we will not address below the problem of dark energy , although it may also be tackled with a modified - gravity viewpoint .",
    "for instance the dgp brane model @xcite predicts an accelerated expansion of the universe without invoking a cosmological constant @xcite , and the k - essence models @xcite also reproduce many cosmological features in a somewhat more natural way than quintessence theories .",
    "some of our theoretical discussions below , notably about stability and causality , are nevertheless directly relevant to such models .",
    "indeed , k - essence theories are characterized by a non - linear function of a scalar field s kinetic term , precisely in the same way relativistic aquadraric lagrangians ( raqual ) were devised to reproduce the mond phenomenology in a consistent field theory @xcite .",
    "our aim is not to discuss the pioneer anomaly in depth either .",
    "although the numerical value of these spacecrafts extra acceleration @xmath13 is of the same order of magnitude as the mond parameter @xmath14 , there indeed exist important differences between their behavior and the mond dynamics .",
    "however , we will come back to the pioneer anomaly at the very end of the present paper . while analyzing a new class of models _ a priori _ devised to reproduce the mond phenomenology , we will show that it can account for the pioneer anomaly without spoiling any of the precision tests of general relativity , while being stable and admitting a well - posed cauchy problem .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ field ] , we examine the various ways one may try to modify the laws of gravity in a consistent relativistic field theory , and give a critical review of several models proposed in the literature . we notably underline that an action should not depend on the mass of a galaxy , otherwise one is defining a different theory for each galaxy .",
    "we also recall why higher - order gravity is generically unstable , contrary to scalar - tensor theories .",
    "when the dynamics of the scalar field is defined by an aquadratic kinetic term ( raqual or k - essence theories ) , we discuss the different consistency conditions it must satisfy .",
    "we point out that such conditions suffice for local causality to be satisfied , although some modes may propagate faster than light or gravitational waves .",
    "we finally recall how ref .",
    "@xcite reproduced the mond gravitational force thanks to a raqual model , but we exhibit a serious fine - tuning problem which does not seem to have been discussed before  or at least was not pointed out so clearly .    in sec .",
    "[ light ] , we recall that many models fail to reproduce the observed light deflection by `` dark matter '' haloes .",
    "we exhibit a counter - example to an erroneous claim in the literature , although this counter - example does not reproduce the correct mond phenomenology .",
    "we also recall how a `` disformal '' ( i.e. , non - conformal ) coupling of the scalar field to matter allowed refs .",
    "@xcite to predict the right light deflection , but that this class of models has been discarded too quickly , because of the existence of superluminal gravitons .",
    "actually , the consistency and causality of such models is clear when analyzed in the einstein frame . on the other hand , we show that the consistency of the field equations _ within _",
    "matter implies new conditions which must be satisfied by the functions defining the theory .",
    "as far as we are aware , these crucial conditions were not derived previously in the literature .",
    "we finally discuss how the best present model , called teves  @xcite , solved the problem of light deflection by considering a stratified theory , involving a unit vector field in addition to a metric tensor and one or several scalar fields .    in sec .",
    "[ section4 ] , we discuss the various difficulties which anyway remain in this teves model , including some which have already been discussed in the literature and that we merely summarize .",
    "reference @xcite proved that the teves hamiltonian is not bounded by below , and therefore that the model is unstable .",
    "we also point out other instabilities in related models .",
    "many papers underlined that stratified theories define a preferred frame , and that they are _ a priori _ inconsistent with solar - system tests of local lorentz invariance of gravity .",
    "however , the vector field is assumed to be dynamical in teves , and it has been argued in @xcite that such tests are now passed . although we do not perform a full analysis ourselves , our discussion suggests that preferred - frame effects are actually expected in teves , and that they may be avoided only at the expense of an unnatural fine - tuning .",
    "the reason why disformal models were discarded in favor of the stratified teves theory was mainly to avoid superluminal gravitons .",
    "however , the opposite phenomenon occurs in teves : photons ( and high - energy matter particles ) propagate faster than gravitons .",
    "references @xcite actually proved that the observation of high - energy cosmic rays imposes tight constraints on such a behavior , because these rays should have lost their energy by cherenkov radiation of gravitational waves . after recalling this argument",
    ", we conclude that the sign of one of the teves parameters should be flipped , implying that gravitons now propagate faster than light , like in the raqual models .",
    "we finally discuss briefly binary - pulsar constraints , still without performing a full analysis , but underlining that a large amount of energy should be emitted as dipolar waves of the scalar field .",
    "the matter - scalar coupling constant should thus be small enough in teves to pass binary - pulsar tests , and this implies an unnatural fine - tuning of its lagrangian .",
    "section  [ nonmin ] is devoted to new models whose point of view differs significantly from those of the literature .",
    "they are extremely simple in vacuum , reducing respectively to general relativity and to brans - dicke theory .",
    "the mond phenomenology is obtained via a non - minimal coupling of matter to the gravitational field(s ) .",
    "however , the first model exhibits a subtle instability , similar to the one occurring in higher - order gravity ( although no tachyon nor ghost degree of freedom may be identified in vacuum ) .",
    "the second model avoids this instability due to higher derivatives , and reproduces the mond phenomenology ( including light deflection ) quite simply , as compared to the literature .",
    "however , our analysis of the field equations shows that they do not remain hyperbolic within the dilute gas in outer regions of a galaxy .",
    "therefore , although promising , this model is inconsistent .",
    "but the same framework provides a simple model to reproduce consistently the pioneer anomaly , without spoiling the precision tests of general relativity .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "we notably mention other experimental constraints that any complete mond - like theory of gravity should also satisfy , besides those which are discussed in the present paper .",
    "einstein s general relativity is based on two independent hypotheses , which are most conveniently described by decomposing its action as @xmath15 .",
    "first , it assumes that all matter fields , including gauge bosons , are minimally coupled to a single metric tensor , that we will denote @xmath16 throughout the present paper .",
    "this metric defines the lengths and times measured by laboratory rods and clocks ( made of matter ) , and is thereby called the `` physical metric '' ( the name `` jordan metric '' is also often used in the literature ) .",
    "the matter action may thus be written as @xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 denotes globally all matter fields , and where the angular brackets indicate a functional dependence .",
    "this so - called `` metric coupling '' implies the weak equivalence principle , i.e. , the fact that laboratory - size objects fall with the same acceleration in an external gravitational field , which is experimentally verified to a few parts in @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the action of a point - particle reads @xmath20 , and depends both on the spacetime position @xmath21 of the particle and its velocity @xmath22 .",
    "the second building block of gr is the einstein - hilbert action @xmath23 which defines the dynamics of a spin-2 field @xmath24 , called the `` einstein metric '' .",
    "we use the sign conventions of  @xcite , notably the mostly - plus signature , and always indicate with a tilde or a star ( either upper or lower ) which metric is used to construct the corresponding quantity .",
    "for instance , @xmath25 is the determinant of the einstein metric and @xmath26 its scalar curvature .",
    "similarly , we will denote as @xmath27 and @xmath28 the covariant derivatives corresponding respectively to the jordan and einstein metrics , and as @xmath29 and @xmath30 the inverses of these two metrics .",
    "this rather heavy notation will allow us to be always sure of what we are talking about in the following .",
    "einstein s second hypothesis is that both metrics coincide : @xmath31 .",
    "milgrom analyzed in  @xcite the consequences of modifying the matter action , that he called `` modified inertia '' .",
    "he focused on a point particle in an external gravitational field , and assumed that its action could depend also on the acceleration @xmath32 and its higher time - derivatives .",
    "however , he proved that to obtain both the newtonian and the mond limits and satisfy galileo invariance , the action must depend on all time - derivatives @xmath33 to any order , i.e. , that the action is necessarily nonlocal .",
    "this does not necessarily violate causality ( see the counter - example in  @xcite ) , and is actually a good feature for the stability of the theory ( see sec .",
    "[ r2 ] below ) , but the actual computation of the predictions is quite involved .",
    "we refer the reader to the detailed paper  @xcite for more information about this interesting viewpoint , but we focus below on metric field theories , i.e. , such that matter is minimally coupled to @xmath16 as in gr , with only first derivatives of the matter fields entering the action .",
    "another way to modify gr is to assume that this physical metric does not propagate as a pure spin-2 field , i.e. , that its dynamics is no longer described by the einstein - hilbert action ( [ eh ] ) , and that @xmath16 is actually a combination of various fields .",
    "since the weak equivalence principle is very well tested experimentally , and implied by a metric coupling , most mond - like models in the literature focused on such a `` modified gravity '' viewpoint , and we will examine them in the present paper . the fact that they involve extra fields , besides the usual graviton ( fluctuation of @xmath24 ) and the various matter fields entering the standard model of particle physics , makes the distinction with dark matter models rather subtle .",
    "the crucial difference is that , in the dark - matter paradigm , the amount of dark matter is imposed by initial conditions , and its clustering generates gravitational wells in which baryonic matter fall to form galaxies and large - scale structures . on the other hand , in the modified - gravity viewpoint ,",
    "baryonic matter generates itself an effective dark - matter halo @xmath34 .",
    "such a halo may just be an artifact of the way we interpret the gravitational field of baryonic matter alone at large distances .",
    "but it may also be a real dark - matter halo , made of the extra gravitational fields , and generating itself a newtonian potential .",
    "in such a case , the difference with standard dark - matter models would be that its mass @xmath35 is imposed as above by the baryonic one , and modified gravity could thus be considered as a constrained class of dark - matter models .",
    "most of the theories that we will mention in the following predict that the energy density of the extra gravitational degrees of freedom is negligible with respect to baryonic matter : @xmath36 a model of the `` constrained dark matter '' type ( @xmath37 ) , as a counter - example to some claims in the literature about light deflection . is caused by a background of gravitational dipoles contributing directly to the newtonian potential . ]    as suggested by milgrom , one may also consider models modifying _ both _ inertia and gravity .",
    "paradoxically , as we will see in sec .  [ matterspin2 ] below , there also exists a non - trivial ( non - gr ) possibility in which _ neither _ of them is modified in the above sense .",
    "matter will be universally coupled to a second - rank symmetric tensor @xmath16 , i.e. , still described by an action @xmath38 $ ] , and the dynamics of gravity will be described by the pure einstein - hilbert action ( [ eh ] ) in vacuum , but the two metrics @xmath16 and @xmath24 will nevertheless differ within matter .      although interesting from a phenomenological point of view , some models proposed in the literature write field equations which do not derive from an action , and can not be obtained within a consistent field theory .",
    "for instance , actually not to reproduce a mond - like behavior but anyway as a model of dark matter , ref .",
    "@xcite proposes to couple differently dark matter and baryonic matter to gravity ( an idea explored in the cosmological context by various authors , notably @xcite ) .",
    "the authors underline themselves that it can not be considered as a fundamental theory ( and they actually need some negative energy to obtain a repulsive force ) , but it is also instructive to stress that it can not derive from an action .",
    "indeed , the scalar field entering this model is assumed not to be generated by baryons , which implies that the scalar - baryon vertex vanishes . on the other hand ,",
    "the assumed equation of motion for this baryonic matter does depend on the scalar field , thereby implying that the scalar - baryon vertex does not vanish . in conclusion , although the behavior of such a model might be mimicked as an effective theory of a more fundamental one , it can not be described itself as a field theory , and notably does not satisfy conservation laws . in the present paper , our discussion will be restricted to consistent field theories .    some models in the literature",
    "do write actions , but they depend on the ( baryonic or luminous ) mass @xmath4 of the galaxy @xcite . for instance ref .",
    "@xcite proposes a gravitational action in which the kinetic term is some power of the ricci scalar @xmath39 . since this implies , in general , an asymptotic velocity of the form @xmath40 , ref .",
    "@xcite then proposes to replace @xmath41 by @xmath42 in order to recover the tully - fisher law . however , without an additional prescription ( which must be non - local in nature ) specifying which mass @xmath4 enters the action , this theory is ill defined .",
    "we will come back to such @xmath43 theories of gravity in sec .",
    "[ r2 ] and in sec .",
    "it should be also underlined that a gravitational force @xmath44 is not difficult to obtain by choosing an appropriate scalar field potential , for instance , as we will illustrate in sec .",
    "[ st ] below .",
    "however , the second crucial feature of mond , which arises from the tully - fisher law , is _ also _ the factor @xmath45 multiplying this @xmath46 .",
    "some consistent field theories actually obtain a flattening of rotation curves but do not predict the right amplitude of the asymptotic velocity @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , einstein and straus studied an extension of general relativity in which the metric tensor is nonsymmetric , @xmath47 . in modern language",
    ", this corresponds to considering an antisymmetric tensor field @xmath48}$ ] as a partner to the usual graviton @xmath49 .",
    "moffat analyzed the phenomenology of this class of models in many papers ( starting with @xcite ) , and it was shown to define a consistent and stable field theory provided @xmath48}$ ] is massive @xcite .",
    "more recently , moffat showed that it may reproduce the flat rotation curves of clusters and galaxies @xcite , probably even better that the original mond proposal .",
    "however , several assumptions are needed to obtain such a prediction , and it can not yet be considered as a predictive field theory , in our opinion .",
    "indeed , the author points out himself that a constant entering his action must take three different values at the solar system , galaxy , and cluster scales .",
    "it must therefore be considered as a running ( renormalized ) coupling constant instead of a pure number imposed in the action , and a complete theory should be able to predict the three needed values .",
    "a related difficulty is the fact that the force generated by the antisymmetric tensor field @xmath48}$ ] is repulsive , whereas galaxy rotation curves need a gravitational attraction greater that the newtonian one . here again , the author invokes renormalization of the constants to obtain the right behavior , but does not provide a full derivation .",
    "but the most instructive difficulty of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the extra force is predicted to be @xmath50 instead of the needed @xmath51 behavior .",
    "the author first assumed in @xcite that an unknown mechanism could tune the proportionality constant to be @xmath52 , so that the right mond phenomenology would be recovered .",
    "more recently @xcite , he managed to derive this relation by assuming a particular form of a potential .",
    "however , this potential does depend explicitly on the mass @xmath4 of the galaxy , and the predictivity of the model is thus lost . in conclusion , although the framework of nonsymmetric gravity seems promising , it is not yet formulated as a closed consistent field theory , and it should only be considered at present as a phenomenological fit of observational data .    in the following ,",
    "we will focus on field theories whose actions do not depend on the mass or scale of the considered objects .",
    "they may involve fine - tuned numbers , but they will be fixed once for all .",
    "this is necessary to define a predictive model , but we will underline that it does not suffice to prove its consistency . in particular , the stability needs to be analyzed carefully .",
    "one - loop divergences of quantized gr @xcite are well known to generate terms proportional to will be later assumed to be minimally coupled to matter . ]",
    "@xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "it is thus natural to consider extensions of gr already involving such higher powers of the curvature tensor in the classical action . at quadratic order ,",
    "it is always possible to write them as @xmath56 , \\label{r+r2}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 denotes the weyl ( fully traceless ) tensor , @xmath58 is the gauss - bonnet topological invariant , and @xmath59 are constants having the dimension of a length squared ( i.e. , @xmath60 if @xmath61 denotes the corresponding mass scale ) .",
    "the topological invariant @xmath62 does not contribute to the local field equations and may thus be discarded . in his famous thesis @xcite ,",
    "stelle proved that such an action gives a renormalizable quantum theory , to all orders , provided both @xmath63 and @xmath64 are nonzero .",
    "however , he also underlined that this can not be the ultimate answer to quantum gravity because such a theory contains a ghost , i.e. , a degree of freedom whose kinetic energy is negative .",
    "to understand this intuitively , it suffices to decompose the schematic propagator in irreducible fractions : @xmath65 where the first term , @xmath66 , corresponds to the propagator of the usual massless graviton , whereas the second term corresponds to a massive degree of freedom such that @xmath67 .",
    "the negative sign of this second term indicates that it carries negative energy .",
    "note that one can not change its sign by playing with that of @xmath63 : if @xmath68 , this extra degree of freedom is even a tachyon ( negative mass squared ) , but it anyway remains a ghost ( negative kinetic energy ) .",
    "the problem with such a ghost degree of freedom is that the theory is violently unstable . indeed",
    ", the vacuum can disintegrate in an arbitrary amount of positive - energy usual gravitons whose energy is balanced by negative - energy ghosts . even at the classical level , although such an instability is difficult to exhibit explicitly on a toy model , one expects anyway the perturbations of a given background to generically diverge , by creating growing gravitational waves containing both positive - energy ( massless ) modes and negative - energy ( massive ) ones .",
    "the actual calculation , taking into account all contracted indices in the propagators , confirms the above schematic reasoning for the @xmath69 term in action ( [ r+r2 ] ) , and shows that the extra massive mode has also a spin 2 , like the usual massless graviton . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath70 term generates in fact a positive - energy massive scalar degree of freedom .",
    "we will recall a well - known and simple derivation in sec .",
    "[ st ] below .",
    "the intuitive explanation is that the scalar mode corresponds in gr to the negative gravitational binding energy ( which is not an actual degree of freedom because it is constrained by the field equations ) , so that the negative sign entering the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ propag ] ) in fact multiplies an already negative term .",
    "the resulting extra degree of freedom thereby appears as a positive - energy scalar field @xcite .",
    "more general actions @xmath71 have been considered several times in the literature , notably in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that they generically contain the massive spin-2 ghost exhibited above , which ruins the stability of the theory .",
    "the only allowed models , within this class , are functions of the scalar curvature alone , @xmath43 , that we will study in sec .  [ st ] below .",
    "the fact that such functions of the curvature _ generically _ involve a ghost tells us that some particular models may avoid it .",
    "one may for instance consider a lagrangian of the form @xmath72 , @xmath73 , whose quadratic term reduces to the gauss - bonnet topological invariant @xmath74 . around a flat minkowski background ,",
    "the only quadratic kinetic term @xmath75 is thus the one coming from the standard einstein - hilbert term @xmath76 , so that no propagator can be defined for any ghost degree of freedom .",
    "however , ref .",
    "@xcite underlined that flat spacetime is generically not a solution of such higher - order gravity theories . around a curved background ,",
    "the second - order expansion of higher - order terms like @xmath77 thereby generates a nonzero kinetic term for the spin-2 ghost ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] in sec .",
    "[ matterspin2 ] below for a diagrammatic illustration ) .",
    "one may still try to devise higher - order gravity models such that their second - order expansion around _ any _ background never generates a negative - energy kinetic term .",
    "for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite consider lagrangians of the form @xmath78 , and show that the two degrees of freedom corresponding to the generic spin-2 ghost are not excited . a similar trick as the one presented in sec .",
    "[ st ] below for @xmath43 models indeed proves that @xmath78 theories only involve a scalar degree of freedom in addition to the usual massless spin-2 graviton .",
    "however , the kinetic terms take nonstandard expressions in this framework , and at present there is no proof that the full hamiltonian is bounded by below .",
    "one can even show that ghost modes do exist in particular backgrounds ( see , e.g. , eq .  ( 22 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , although this does not prove either that the hamiltonian is necessarily unbounded by below . in our opinion ,",
    "the clearest hint that @xmath78 models are probably unstable comes from the schematic reasoning of eq .",
    "( [ propag ] ) above . in @xmath43 models , the scalar degree of freedom happened to have positive kinetic energy because it corresponded to a higher - order excitation of the negative - energy newtonian potential ( constrained by the field equations ) . in @xmath78 models , the scalar degree of freedom _",
    "a priori _ corresponds to a higher - order excitation of _ another _ mode present in gr , generically dynamical and therefore carrying positive energy . the crucial minus sign entering eq .",
    "( [ propag ] ) then shows that the new scalar mode should probably be a ghost .",
    "more generally , deadly instabilities can exist in higher - order field theories even if no ghost degree of freedom can be identified in a perturbative way .",
    "indeed , as recalled notably in @xcite , their hamiltonian is generically unbounded by below because it is linear in at least one of the canonical momenta . as in @xcite ,",
    "let us illustrate this on the simplest example of a lagrangian depending on a variable @xmath79 and its first two time derivatives , say @xmath80 .",
    "if @xmath81 can be eliminated from @xmath82 by partial integration , we are in the standard case of a theory depending only on first derivatives , and we know that some models do give a hamiltonian which is bounded by below .",
    "this is the case when @xmath81 appears only linearly in @xmath82 , even multiplied by a function of @xmath79 and @xmath83 since @xmath84 boundary terms .",
    "let us thus consider only the case of a `` non - degenerate '' lagrangian , models studied in refs .",
    "@xcite are degenerate , so that their hamiltonian can not be written in the ostrogradski form ( [ h ] ) , but this does not suffice to prove their stability . ]",
    "i.e. , such that the definition @xmath85 can be inverted to express @xmath81 as a function of @xmath79 , @xmath83 and @xmath86 : @xmath87 in such a case , ostrogradski showed in 1850 @xcite that the initial data must be specified by two pairs of conjugate momenta , that he defined as    [ qp ] @xmath88    and he proved that the following definition of the hamiltonian @xmath89 does generate time translations .",
    "indeed , @xmath90 and @xmath91 reproduce the euler - lagrange equations of motion deriving from the original lagrangian @xmath82 .",
    "however , this hamiltonian must be expressed in terms of the momenta @xmath92 and @xmath93 defined in eqs .",
    "( [ qp ] ) above .",
    "recalling that eq .",
    "( [ ddotq ] ) allows us to write @xmath94 , one gets @xmath95 the crucial problem of this expression is that it is linear in @xmath96 , and therefore unbounded by below @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the theory is necessarily unstable , even if one does not identify any explicit contribution @xmath97 defining a ghost degree of freedom . if one diagonalizes the kinetic terms in eq .",
    "( [ hbis ] ) at quadratic order , say in terms of new momenta @xmath98 , then the standard positive - energy degree of freedom should appear as @xmath99 .",
    "since we know that @xmath100 is unbounded by below , the other momentum @xmath101 must have a negative contribution , but it may be for instance of the form @xmath102 , and therefore absent at quadratic order .    this result can be straightforwardly extended to ( non - degenerate ) models depending on even higher time - derivatives of @xmath79 , say up to @xmath103 . in that case ,",
    "@xcite shows that the hamiltonian is linear in @xmath104 of the momenta @xmath93 , and thereby unbounded by below . on the other hand ,",
    "ostrogradski s construction of the hamiltonian can not be used if @xmath82 depends on an _ infinite _ number of time derivatives , i.e. , if it defines a _ nonlocal _ theory .",
    "in such a case , the theory may actually be stable although its expansion looks pathological @xcite .",
    "this is notably the case in the effective low - energy models defined by string theory , which do involve quadratic curvature terms like eq .",
    "( [ r+r2 ] ) above , but also any higher derivative of the curvature tensor ( whose phenomenological effects occur at the same order as the quadratic terms ) .",
    "nonlocal models of mond have been studied in the literature @xcite , and they can be proved to satisfy anyway causality , but they remain difficult to study from a phenomenological point of view . in the following , we will focus on local field theories .",

    "near a binary system , these fields can not be static because they are driven by the orbital motion .",

    "ghost degrees of freedom are known to be deadly at the quantum level , because the vacuum then disintegrates instantaneously  @xcite .    in conclusion , the nonminimally - coupled model ( [ nonminaction])-([gtilde ] )",

    "this number is not far from the needed dark matter density @xmath947 in the standard @xmath2cdm ( cosmological constant plus cold dark matter ) cosmological model , and illustrates that the existence of dark matter ( as massive neutrinos ) would anyway be needed in the teves model , although the mond dynamics was initially devised to avoid the dark matter hypothesis .",
    "however , it is already known that some amount of dark matter is anyway needed to account for the cluster rotation curves , within the mond model , and massive neutrinos would be perfect candidates since they can cluster on such scales although they are too light to cluster on galaxy scales . therefore , a mond - like field theory remains a possibility , provided there is a large enough density of massive neutrinos  or any other dark matter candidate with similar properties . in the model @xcite ,",
    "closely related to teves , one of the two scalar degrees of freedom is assumed to play the role of this dark matter .",
    "a third difficulty of mond - like field theories is also to explain the numerical coincidence @xmath948 between the mond acceleration constant and the hubble constant ( i.e. , the present expansion rate of the universe )  @xcite .",
    "some very promising ideas have been developed notably in @xcite , but it can not be considered as a prediction .",

    "in such a case , it would not vary with time , and one would `` only '' have to explain why it happens to take this precise value . on the other hand ,",
    "a constant value of @xmath14 would probably be ruled out by the observed cmb spectrum , although this obviously depends on the precise features of the model .",
    "a fourth and related difficulty is to explain structure formation without cold dark matter , while remaining consistent with the tiny amplitude of cmb fluctuations . as far as we are aware",
    ", there is at present no obvious solution to this crucial problem , and a larger value of @xmath14 at early cosmological times might be necessary . the modification of gravity , the possible renormalization of newton s constant @xmath950 at large distances , and the contribution of the various fields entering the model might also contribute to a solution .",
    "a fifth difficulty is more theoretical than experimental .",
    "the action - reaction principle implies that if a mass @xmath951 feels a force @xmath952 caused by a second mass @xmath953 , in the mond regime , then the latter must feel the opposite force and thereby undergo an acceleration @xmath954 .",
    "since this expression diverges as @xmath955 , any light enough particle should thus be infinitely accelerated by distant objects feeling its mond potential .",
    "actually , the self - energy of such particles must be properly renormalized , and it has been proven in @xcite that the raqual model does not suffer from any inconsistency due to the action - reaction principle .",

    "the exact expression of the forces has been derived in @xcite , @xmath957 $ ] , so that the acceleration @xmath958 remains finite even when @xmath955 .",
    "although we expect that similar arguments would apply for any field theory deriving from an action principle , it remains to explicitly prove so for new models that one may consider , for instance for the class of nonminimally coupled fields studied in sec .",
    "[ nonmin ] above .",
    "all these difficulties , in addition to those discussed in the present paper , underline that the construction of a consistent field theory reproducing the mond dynamics and the right light deflection is far from being obvious .",
    "although the considered actions depend on several free functions allowing us to _ fit _ different kinds of data , there are so many theoretical and experimental constraints that no model passes all of them at present .",
    "the conclusion of our analysis seems thus to be in favor of the dark matter paradigm . on the other hand , the tully - fisher law , i.e.",
    ", the existence of a universal acceleration scale @xmath14 , has not yet been derived in dark matter models .",
    "more generally , dark matter profiles seem to be tightly correlated to baryonic ones @xcite ( up to apparent counterexamples such as the bullet cluster @xcite ) , and this lacks any explanation in cdm whereas this is an obvious prediction of mond .",
    "therefore , the dark and baryonic matter clustering still needs to be understood in more detail , and the analysis of modified gravity theories remains an interesting alternative to the standard @xmath2cdm paradigm .",

    "<S> modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) is a possible way to explain the flat galaxy rotation curves without invoking the existence of dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> it is however quite difficult to predict such a phenomenology in a consistent field theory , free of instabilities and admitting a well - posed cauchy problem . </S>",
    "<S> we examine critically various proposals of the literature , and underline their successes and failures both from the experimental and the field - theoretical viewpoints . </S>",
    "<S> we exhibit new difficulties in both cases , and point out the hidden fine tuning of some models . on the other hand , we show that several published no - go theorems are based on hypotheses which may be unnecessary , so that the space of possible models is _ a priori _ larger . </S>",
    "<S> we examine a new route to reproduce the mond physics , in which the field equations are particularly simple outside matter . </S>",
    "<S> however , the analysis of the field equations _ within _ matter ( a crucial point which is often forgotten in the literature ) exhibits a deadly problem , namely that they do not remain always hyperbolic . </S>",
    "<S> incidentally , we prove that the same theoretical framework provides a stable and well - posed model able to reproduce the pioneer anomaly without spoiling any of the precision tests of general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion is that all mond - like models proposed in the literature , including the new ones examined in this paper , present serious difficulties : not only they are unnaturally fine tuned , but they also fail to reproduce some experimental facts or are unstable or inconsistent as field theories </S>",
    "<S> . however , some frameworks , notably the tensor - vector - scalar ( teves ) one of bekenstein and sanders , seem more promising than others , and our discussion underlines in which directions one should try to improve them . </S>"
