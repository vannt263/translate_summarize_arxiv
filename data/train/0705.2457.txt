    "since the detection of the first extrasolar giant planet ( egp ) , 51 peg b @xcite , considerable effort has gone into both observing and modeling properties of the atmospheres of the close - in `` hot jupiter '' planets .",
    "spitzer space telescope _ now provides us a unique probe into the mid - infrared emission from these exotic atmospheres .    in this letter",
    "we examine mid infrared spectra of transiting planets hd  209458b  and hd  189733b , which were recently observed with _ spitzer _ s infrared spectrograph ( irs ) by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the spectra were obtained from @xmath27.5 to 14@xmath3 m around the time of secondary eclipse .",
    "the most prominent conclusion of these works is that strong absorption arising from h@xmath4o , expected short - ward of 10@xmath3 m , was not seen for either planet .",
    "possible explanations put forward for the relatively featureless spectra included a lack of h@xmath4o in these atmospheres , masking by a continuum of opaque clouds , or an isothermal temperature structure .",
    "recently @xcite published an 8@xmath3 m light curve for hd  189733b  that includes an observation of the secondary eclipse .",
    "these observations used _ spitzer _",
    "s infrared array camera ( irac ) .",
    "we suggest that this data point is inconsistent with the irs spectrum , that water vapor is present and absorbs from 6.5 - 10@xmath3 m , and that the published , low s / n spectrum of hd  189733b  may not reflect the true planet spectrum .",
    "we have computed model atmospheres and spectra of hd  189733b  and hd  209458b  in an effort to shed additional light on these exciting observations .",
    "we will also briefly discuss l- and t - type brown dwarfs , whose atmospheres span the same temperature range as hot jupiters .",
    "we suggest that the generally very good fits of our models to these high signal - to - noise irac and irs datasets supports the veracity of the underlying physics and chemistry of our planet models .",
    "two teams employed the irs instrument in `` short - low '' configuration to obtain low resolution spectra of parent stars hd  209458 and hd  189733 around the time of planetary secondary eclipse .",
    "each group compared the spectrum of the system when the planet s day side was still visible ( before and after the secondary eclipse ) to the stellar spectrum when the planet was behind the star .",
    "the observed enhancement in flux seen when the planet was visible was attributed to the planet , thus providing a measurement of the planet - to - star flux ratio .",
    "these exciting and difficult observations are at the leading edge of spectral characterization of exoplanets .",
    "@xcite observed two secondary eclipse events of planet hd  189733b  and from these observations published a planet - to - star flux ratio from 7.57 to 14.71@xmath3 m .",
    "they found a flux ratio spectrum that is essentially flat across these wavelengths with a mean eclipse depth of @xmath5 .",
    "the subset of their data with the highest signal - to - noise is shown in _",
    "@xcite observed two secondary eclipses of planet hd  209458b  and published a flux ratio spectrum from 7.5 to 13.2@xmath3 m .",
    "the derived average ratio is shown in _",
    "c_. these authors also find a spectrum that could be characterized as mostly flat .",
    "however , they also detect increases in the flux ratio from 9.3 - 10@xmath3 m , as well as a narrow emission feature at 7.7@xmath3 m , which they attribute to emission from a stratosphere .",
    "in addition to spectra , we plot _ spitzer _ secondary eclipse photometric data . these points",
    "include the irs blue peak - up at 16@xmath3 m @xcite and the irac 8@xmath3 m point @xcite for hd  189733b , and the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) point at 24@xmath3 m for hd  209458b  @xcite .",
    "we note that in _ a _ the irac 8@xmath3 m point clearly plots below the irs data , which we ll discuss in detail in  2.2 .          in order to further the study of these observations and their constraints on the character of each planet s atmosphere",
    "we have computed model atmospheres and generated low resolution spectra .",
    "we employ a 1d model atmosphere code that has been used for a variety of planetary and substellar objects .",
    "recently it has been used for brown dwarfs @xcite and egps @xcite .",
    "it explicitly includes both incident radiation from the parent star ( if present ) and thermal radiation from the planet s atmosphere .",
    "the radiative transfer solving scheme was developed by @xcite and was first applied to irradiated giant planet atmospheres by @xcite .",
    "we use the elemental abundance data of @xcite and compute chemical equilibrium compositions following lodders & fegley ( 2002 , 2006 ) .",
    "our opacity database is described in @xcite .",
    "the stellar models are from @xcite and the system parameters are from @xcite for hd  189733b  and @xcite for hd  209458b .",
    "the planet models presented here are cloud - free .",
    "we plot model planet - to - star flux ratios in . for hd  189733b",
    "we show two one - dimensional models .",
    "the solid red curve is for a day - side model that assumes all incident flux is efficiently redistributed over the entire planet , meaning that the incident flux is multiplied by a factor of 1/4 @xcite .",
    "following conventions adopted in solar system atmosphere modeling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , here and in our previous papers @xcite the incident flux is decreased by incorporating a multiplicative factor @xmath6 of 1/2 due to the day - night average , and another factor of 1/2 arises from the mean 60@xmath7 stellar zenith angle ( @xmath3 , the cosine of this angle , is 0.5 ) that is correct for global average insolation conditions @xcite . with this prescription more stellar flux",
    "is absorbed at low pressures , leading to a warmer upper atmosphere and shallower temperature gradient , compared to a model where incident flux is directly multiplied by 1/4 with @xmath3=1.0 .",
    "the greater absorption of incident flux at lower pressure is due to the twice longer path length for incident photons to reach a given pressure . in reality , these differences in 1d models could be swamped by a more complex day - side temperature structure for these planets . here , for models with a warmer day side ,",
    "the incident flux is multiplied by a factor @xmath6 between 1/2 and 1 , while @xmath3 remains 0.5 .",
    "the dash - dot curve in _",
    "c _ is for a warmer model , where @xmath8 , meaning that only 20% of the absorbed incident flux is assumed to be advected to the night side .",
    "both models predict an absorption feature due to h@xmath4o short - ward of 10@xmath3 m .",
    "_ b _ shows absorption cross sections for h@xmath4o , co , and ch@xmath9 . at these temperatures ( @xmath21200 k ) , co is strongly favored at the expense of ch@xmath9 .",
    "the dashed model in _ a _ is a good ( @xmath21@xmath10 ) fit to the band - averaged 8@xmath3 m @xcite and 16@xmath3 m @xcite secondary eclipse observations .",
    "we note that although @xcite claim their flat ratio spectrum is consistent with a blackbody , _ a _ shows that it is actually bluer than a blackbody .",
    "_ c _ shows the mean @xcite data set . in solid red",
    "we plot the @xmath11 1d model spectrum from @xcite .",
    "note that the predicted `` downturn '' in the ratio spectrum short - ward of 10@xmath3 m is actually quite small in this 1d model , less than that predicted by other modelers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for reasons that are not yet clear , but could be related to the angle of incident radiation . given the s / n of this dataset and the relatively small predicted depth of the model h@xmath4o absorption feature , it is not clear that absorption due to h@xmath4o can be dismissed .",
    "dynamical processes can act to produce isothermal profiles in the upper atmosphere which would also suppress the depths of absorption features . in solid blue",
    "we plot the spectrum of the day side of the @xcite 3d dynamical model of hd  209458b , as computed in @xcite .",
    "the isothermal atmosphere is due to a super - rotating west - to - east equatorial jet ; as cool night side gas is blown around the planet s limb this gas is more readily warmed at lower pressures where the radiative time constant is shorter @xcite , leading to day side _ p - t _ profiles that are more isothermal than one would predict for a radiative equilibrium model @xcite .",
    "neither the 1d nor 3d model has the increase in flux ratio seen from @xmath12@xmath3 m , as neither model has the strong temperature inversion that would be necessary to create emission features . in _",
    "b _ we plot the mie absorption efficiency of 1@xmath3 m silicate particles of forsterite ( mg@xmath4sio@xmath9 ) and enstatite ( mgsio@xmath13 ) .",
    "larger particles have a grayer spectrum and do not exhibit the canonical silicate feature @xcite .",
    "the location of this possible emission feature in the hd  209458b  spectrum is suggestive , but it will take higher signal - to - noise observations to determine if silicates have indeed been detected .",
    "hd  209458b  is a better candidate than hd  189733b  for having silicate clouds in its visible atmosphere , due to the higher stellar insolation and hotter atmosphere .      as was noted above and shown in _",
    "a _ , the irac observation at 8@xmath3 m by @xcite indicates a downturn that is in fact consistent with h@xmath4o vapor absorption .",
    "we now take a closer look in . our model ( red )",
    "is a good fit to the data , while in blue we show a @xcite model , as taken from @xcite , that appears to also be a good fit to the photometry , albeit with a much deeper water feature . binning the 31 irs data points from 7.57 to 9.39@xmath3 m ( which overlaps the irac band ) into a single point",
    ", we find an eclipse depth of @xmath14 , @xmath25.3@xmath10 removed from the knutson et al .  irac point .",
    "if variation in planetary or stellar flux were to account for this difference ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the variability would have to be @xmath225% near 8@xmath3 m .",
    "if there is no variability and both the irs spectrum and irac data point are accurate as published , we can examine how small the flux ratio must be short - ward of the bluest irs point at 7.57@xmath3 m .",
    "we have created synthetic data with the same spectral resolution of the irs data set . in triangles",
    "we show a constant flux ratio of 0.00156 between 6.3@xmath3 m ( the blue end of the irac filter ) and 7.57@xmath3 m . in boxes we show a synthetic ratio that decreases linearly from the 0.00430 binned value .",
    "the ratio must fall to _ zero _ by 6.79@xmath3 m to give a band - average eclipse depth that agrees precisely with the irac data point .    in _ b _ we showed that the only potential absorbers predicted from equilibrium chemistry from 6 to 10@xmath3 m are h@xmath4o and ch@xmath9 ,",
    "neither of which possess a sharp increase in opacity short - ward of 7.7@xmath3 m .",
    "with the assumption that the irac secondary eclipse depth is accurate , and given the severe absorption feature that would be needed just short of 7.57@xmath3 m to fit this point given the irs spectrum , we conclude that the published irs spectrum short - ward of 10@xmath3 m does not reflect the true spectrum at these wavelengths , where the irac data point suggests absorption by water vapor .",
    "one possibility toward reconciling the data sets would be to shift the entire irs spectrum downward .",
    "indeed , for hd  209458b , @xcite were unable to accurately determine the absolute depth of the secondary eclipse with the irs , and therefore tied their spectrum to an unpublished irac 8@xmath3 m observation of the secondary eclipse . given this issue , the absolute depths of the @xcite data may also require a shift .",
    "however , the downward shift that would be required ( @xmath225% ) would lead to much poorer agreement between this data set and the @xcite point at 16@xmath3 m .",
    "in addition , although both teams corrected for slit losses , this was only done in a gray manner .",
    "since the point spread function is larger at longer wavelengths , it is possible that slit losses would be more pronounced at the red end of the spectrum .",
    "greater flux at longer wavelengths , together with a downward scaling , may be able to bring the observed spectrum for hd  189733b  into agreement with the photometric points .",
    "future work on all of these data sets may be beneficial , as , for example , the relative photometry for these measurements is more than an order of magnitude more precise than irac s initial specifications @xcite .",
    "the _ p - t _ conditions encountered by the atmospheres of hot jupiters is coincident with that found in the atmospheres of l- and t - type brown dwarfs . although the actual _ p - t _ profiles of irradiated egps are of course different , the underlying atmospheric physics and chemistry are similar and indeed the actual computational models are in some cases virtually identical , such that a comparison of brown dwarf models to data can illuminate theoretical areas that are well understood .",
    "comparisons of our group s models to near- and mid - infrared spectra of l- and t - dwarfs , including superb observations with the irs , have generally found very good to excellent matches with data @xcite .",
    "specifically our `` cloudy '' l - dwarf and `` clear '' t dwarf models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* m.  s. marley et al . in prep . )",
    "fit the depths of the water bands lying between y , j , h , and k bands as well as the @xmath15 water band @xcite expected in the irs spectra of hot jupiters .",
    "there are , however , departures from the data in regions where molecular opacities are poorly known as well as some systematic spectral shape differences in k and n bands .    since the marley et al .",
    "models have been demonstrated to fit the near and mid infrared data of the cloud - free t dwarfs we gain confidence in our radiative transfer @xcite , opacity database @xcite , and chemistry calculations @xcite .",
    "this experience gives us confidence these areas are becoming well understood .",
    "of course , since isolated brown dwarfs lack incident flux that drive atmospheric dynamics and photochemistry , these additional areas may remain challenging topics of hot jupiter characterization for some time .",
    "it is in deviations from 1d or simple day / night models that these aspects will become apparent .",
    "the common conclusion of the @xcite and @xcite secondary eclipse observations was the apparent lack of absorption due to water vapor .",
    "however , for hd  189733b  we have shown that photometry indicates a planet - to - star flux ratio that is not as featureless as indicated by the published irs data .",
    "if variability in planetary flux is to make up for this discrepancy , it must reach @xmath225% .",
    "the apparent downturn in the flux ratio from 16 to 8@xmath3 m implied by photometry is consisent with a model that predicts absorption due to water shortward of 10@xmath3 m .",
    "as was shown in , there is considerable diversity in feature depths among models , perhaps due to differences in chemistry , opacities , or treatment of incoming stellar flux .    for hd  189733b , here",
    "we have shown that our model is a good match to 8 and 16@xmath3m - band photometry .",
    "in addition , both our 1d and 3d models fit the hd  209458b  observations reasonably well . our conclusion that water vapor absorption is present in these atmospheres",
    "is supported by the recent analysis of the @xcite transit data set by @xcite , who concluded that water absorption in present in the atmosphere of hd  209458b  in a band at @xmath16 nm .",
    "of course the characterization of the atmospheres of these planets is just beginning .",
    "both planets have been observed in all 4 irac bands , but this data has not yet been published .",
    "additional irs spectroscopic observations for hd  209458b  ( deming and collaborators ) and hd  189733b  ( grillmair and collaborators ) will be obtained this year .",
    "importantly , these observations will go down to 5.5@xmath3 m , fully overlapping the irac 8@xmath3 m band , which will allow for more accurate normalization of the obtained spectra .",
