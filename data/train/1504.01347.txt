    "bilayer graphene may be stacked in three different configurations , namely the ab - type ( bernal stacking ) , aa - type and twisted - type .",
    "the twisted bilayer graphene ( tblg ) is the most general , consisting of two sheets of graphene rotated by an arbitrary twist angle @xmath0 other than an integer multiples of @xmath1 .",
    "each of the three stacking types exhibits a different low energy electronic structure , and hence a different optical response @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the interlayer interaction in tblg , in particular , modifies significantly the low - energy band structure and yields novel electronic features not present in monolayer graphene or other bilayer graphenes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the tblg , therefore , has the richest optical absorption spectrum , owing to its complex low energy band structure , where the optical response is observed to be highly tunable through the twist angle @xmath0 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "commensuration in tblg occurs at very specific twist angles @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "experimentally prepared tblg structures are in general incommensurate .",
    "the electronic band structures of bilayer and few - layers graphene have been investigated intensively using absorption measurement experiments @xcite-@xcite .",
    "theoretically , various models have been developed to calculate the electronic structure in commensurate tblg @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "these models were also used to calculate the optical absorption for tblg for a wide range of rotation angles , doping conditions , and interlayer potential asymmetry @xcite,@xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the optical properties of incommensurate twisted bilayer ( tblg ) and few - layers graphene ( tflg ) have not been investigated yet on the basis of a systematic theory for incommensurate heterostructures .",
    "incommensurate tblg constitutes a disordered heterostructure characterized by a quasi - continuum set of interlayer bonds , and a quasi - infinite set of configurations for carbon atoms at the bilayer interface . in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we have developed a non - trivial virtual crystal approximation - tight binding ( vca - tb ) theory to study the electronic properties in such systems .",
    "our vca - tb theoretical approach determines the vca effective medium for the incommensurate tblg system , derived in a direct manner from the quasi - infinite set of structural configurations at the bilayer interface .",
    "the theory consequently determines the vca - tb hamiltonian for the effective vca system and yields the tblg s electronic structure and density of states for any incommensurate twist angle @xmath0 .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to extend the vca - tb theoretical approach to study the electronic structure and the optical absorption properties in incommensurate twisted few - layers graphene ( tflg ) with arbitrary stacking geometries .",
    "the band structure for incommensurate tflg calculated by the vca - tb method is found to be formed of overlapped dirac cones , equal in number to that of the graphene sheets forming the incommensurate heterostructure .",
    "the overlap between these dirac cones gives rise to numerous saddle points in the low - energy band structure and consequently to van hove singularities ( vhs ) in the density of states ( dos ) .",
    "the optical absorption spectrum , calculated in the framework of the vca - tb theory , is found to be characterized by a series of peaks associated with the angle dependent van hove singularities .",
    "the transition energies corresponding to optical absorption peaks are hence directly tunable via the rotation angles defining the twists in the stacking configurations of the incommensurate tflg .",

    "ii we extend the vca - tb model and apply it to determine the band structures and densities of states for incommensurate twisted tflg . in section iii",
