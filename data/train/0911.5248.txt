    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , which can last from milliseconds to nearly an hour , are the most luminous astrophysical events observed so far . the parameter of @xmath0 , which is defined as the time interval during which the background - subtracted cumulative counts increase from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , is usually used to denote the time duration of grbs . those with @xmath8 are conventionally described as long / soft grbs and those with @xmath9 as short / hard grbs  @xcite .",
    "in  @xcite , it was demonstrated that the x - ray decay curves of grbs measured by _",
    "swift _ can be fitted using one or two components  the prompt component and the optional afterglow component  both of which have exactly the same functional form comprised of an early falling exponential phase and a following power - law decay .",
    "the prompt component contains the prompt gamma - ray emission and the initial x - ray decay .",
    "the transition time @xmath1 from the exponential phase to the power - law decay in the prompt component defines an alternative estimate of the grb duration , which is comparable with @xmath0 for most grbs  @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed the classification of grbs into long and short ones at @xmath10 instead .",
    "grbs can be observed at very high redshifts due to their high luminosities .",
    "for example , the recently observed grb 090423 has a redshift of @xmath11  @xcite . it may be possible to calibrate grbs as standard candles  ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* etc . ) .",
    "the key to the calibration of grbs is to find correlations between some measurable properties ( the luminosity indicators ) of grbs and the energy ( the isotropic energy @xmath12 or the collimation - corrected energy @xmath13 ) or the luminosity ( e.g. , the peak luminosity @xmath14 ) of grbs .",
    "these correlations are usually referred to as luminosity relations , which are useful both in applying grbs to cosmology and understanding grbs themselves .",
    "the grb luminosity relations used in cosmological studies in the literature include the relations of @xmath15 ( the spectral lag , i.e. , the time shift between the hard and soft light curves)@xmath14",
    "@xcite , @xmath16 ( the variability , a quantitative measurement on the spikiness of the light curve ; there exist several definitions of @xmath16 , mainly depending on the smoothing time intervals the reference curve is built upon , and on the normalization as well)@xmath14  @xcite , @xmath17 ( peak energy of the spectrum)@xmath12  @xcite , @xmath17@xmath13  @xcite , @xmath17@xmath14  @xcite , and @xmath18 ( minimum rise time of the light curve)@xmath14  @xcite .",
    "for each of the above luminosity relations , there is only one luminosity indicator involved .",
    "more complicated luminosity relations , which include two luminosity indicators are also discussed in the literature ; see , for example , @xcite and references therein .    in this paper , we explore the correlation between @xmath1 and the x - ray luminosity of grbs at @xmath1 and discuss its implications , especially on the time duration of grbs and their classification .",
    "in  @xcite , the x - ray light curves of grbs were constructed from the combination of burst alert telescope ( bat ) and x - ray telescope ( xrt ) data in the way described by  ( * ? ? ? * the bat data is extrapolated to the xrt band ) and fitted using one or two components  the prompt component and the optional afterglow component  both of which have the same functional form : @xmath19 the transition from the exponential to the power law occurs at the point @xmath20 .",
    "the subscript @xmath21 is replaced by @xmath22 for the prompt component and by @xmath23 for the afterglow component , and the fitted x - ray flux is the sum of the two components , i.e. , @xmath24 . in the derivation of the parameters ,",
    "an initial fit was done to find the peak position of the prompt emission ; the peak time was then used as time zero .",
    "a second fit was done with @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the derived parameters are all referenced with respect to the estimated peak time rather than the somewhat arbitrary bat trigger time .",
    "in addition , large flares have been masked out of the fitting procedure  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion on the average luminosity of x - ray flares as a function of time ) .",
    "we investigated the correlation between the transition time @xmath1 for the prompt component and the x - ray luminosity of grbs at @xmath1  ( see also * ? ? ? * for a discussion on the correlation between @xmath26 and the luminosity at @xmath26 ) .",
    "the fit of the grb light curves directly gives the values of @xmath1 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of grbs at a given time @xmath27 is calculated by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the luminosity distance , for which we have used the flat @xmath30cdm cosmological model with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the @xmath34-corrected flux given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the spectral index and , in general , it is time dependent .",
    "@xcite presented in table 3 of their paper the spectral index in the prompt phase ( @xmath37 ; from the bat data ) , in the prompt decay ( @xmath38 ; from the xrt data ) , on the plateau of the afterglow component ( @xmath39 ; xrt data ) , and in the final decay ( @xmath40 ; xrt data ) . since the bat data have been extrapolated to the xrt band in the combination of the bat data and xrt data , @xmath41 should be used here and for this limited energy range , the simple power - law @xmath42 is sufficient for the grb spectrum .",
    "so , the x - ray luminosity of grbs at the transition time @xmath1 is @xmath43 where we have used @xmath44 at @xmath45 .    for the investigation of the correlation , we mainly fit the data to the relation @xmath46 where @xmath5 is the corresponding transition time in the burst frame . like many other luminosity relations ,",
    "this relation is by no means an accurate one .",
    "due to the complexity of grbs , it is hardly possible that @xmath2 is fully determined by only @xmath4 $ ] . as usual",
    ", intrinsic scatter @xmath47 is introduced here , i.e. , lacking further knowledge , an extra variability that follows the normal distribution @xmath48 is added to take into account the contributions to @xmath2 from hidden variables . for the fit , we used the techniques presented in  @xcite . let @xmath49",
    "$ ] and @xmath50 ; according to  @xcite , the joint likelihood function for the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath51 and the intrinsic scatter @xmath47 is @xmath52    , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are corresponding observational data for the @xmath55th grb .    for grb data , we used the samples compiled in  @xcite , that is , the @xmath56 grbs detected by both bat and xrt on _ swift _ up to 2006 august 1 .",
    "the @xmath0 duration for these @xmath56 grbs were obtained from http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/. the uncertainties of the fitted parameters in  @xcite are given in @xmath57 confidence level .",
    "we symmetrize the errors and derive the corresponding @xmath58 uncertainties by just dividing the @xmath57 confidence level errors by @xmath59 . unless stated explicitly , the errors in this paper are for the @xmath58 confidence level . in our analysis , when not all of the grbs have the needed parameters available , we use the maximum subset of the @xmath56 grbs satisfying the requirement .",
    "for example , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : luminosity_xp ] ) , the calculation of @xmath3 needs the observed redshift @xmath60 , in addition to @xmath61 and @xmath37 , which are derived from the fit of grb data .",
    "we plot the logarithm of @xmath3 versus the logarithm of @xmath5 in figure  [ fig : lp_vs_tpz ] , which include @xmath62 grbs .",
    "we can see that most of the grbs ( @xmath63 grbs ) lie in the range of @xmath64 .",
    "there is obviously a correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , when fitting the grbs to the relations of eq .",
    "( [ eq : luminosity_relation ] ) , we have different options depending on how we view the three grbs with the largest @xmath5 , i.e. , those with @xmath65 . for the first choice",
    ", we can simply include all the data points in the fit ( see the top panel of figure  [ fig : fit_result ] ) , which leads to a result that the grb with the largest @xmath5 lies outside the @xmath66 confidence region of the fit .",
    "alternatively , it is also possible that the grbs with the largest @xmath5 , instead of just being outliers , may indeed reveal some trend of the luminosity relation at large @xmath5 . in this case",
    ", we can not simply ignore the grbs with large @xmath5 just because their quantity is small and , if they are taken more seriously , it seems that the samples are split into two groups at some value of @xmath5 based on the slope of the luminosity relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : luminosity_relation ] ) . to show this",
    ", we perform a fit using only the grbs with @xmath67 ( see the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : fit_result ] ) , which gives a result quite different from the prior fit . from the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : fit_result ]",
    ", we can see that if the best fit line is extended to the range of @xmath68 , all the grbs with @xmath68 lie below the line . as a comparison",
    ", we also fit the grbs with @xmath64 ( see figure  [ fig : fit_result_subl ] ) , which show that the difference is indeed introduced by the three grbs with the largest @xmath5 when compared with the fit of grbs with @xmath67 .",
    "we tabulate the fit results in table  [ tab : fit_result ] . from the table",
    ", we can see that the values of @xmath51 for the first two cases are quite different .",
    "in addition , it is also interesting to note that , for the first case , the slope @xmath51 is close to the slope ( @xmath69 ) of a similar luminosity relation about @xmath26 and luminosity at @xmath26 presented in  @xcite . for the second case ,",
    "the slope @xmath51 is close to the index ( @xmath70 ) of the power - law declination of the average luminosity of x - ray flares as a function of time presented in  @xcite .",
    "these coincidences may be worth noting in future studies with a bigger sample of grbs .",
    "+    generally speaking , in statistical analysis , except for the different measurement precisions , we should treat all the data points equally and should not give more attention to some data points over the others .",
    "however , since our sample of grbs here is very limited , and there are only a few grbs with very large @xmath5 , some selection rules may have already been imposed implicitly on the sample itself . considering this",
    ", it may be unfair to the grbs with large @xmath5 to be treated as outliers just because their quantity is small , especially when they may reveal some trend in the luminosity relation .",
    "this is why we consider both cases in the analysis , i.e. , whether the few grbs with large @xmath5 should be treated as just outliers or taken more seriously .",
    "correspondingly , the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath5 could be a simple power law or a broken power law with a change in the slope of eq .",
    "( [ eq : luminosity_relation ] ) at some characteristic value of @xmath5 . for the present sample of grbs used in our analysis ,",
    "it is not sufficient for us to conclude which case is real and , for the later one , to determine the exact value of @xmath5 where the slope of the luminosity relation changes . here ,",
    "we leave it open to future studies with more grbs and discuss in the following the implications of the luminosity relation , especially in the situation where there is a change in the slope at some value of @xmath5 .",
    "first of all , we emphasize that the luminosity relation is between the luminosity and @xmath1 , though @xmath1 and @xmath0 can both act as an estimate of the grb duration and are comparable to each other for most grbs , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : tp_vs_t90 ] .",
    "a similar relation seems not to exist between the luminosity and the @xmath0 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : lp_vs_t90z ] ; the corresponding data points turn out to be very dispersive . despite the fact that most grbs in figure  [ fig : tp_vs_t90 ] are distributed around the line on which they are equal , there are some of them that have been considerably different from @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the two quantities differ from each other significantly from their derivation .",
    "@xmath0 is calculated directly by using the bat data in the @xmath71@xmath72 kev band , while for the calculation of @xmath1 , the bat data are first extrapolated to the xrt band of @xmath73@xmath74 kev in order to be combined with the xrt data . for @xmath0 ,",
    "the emphasis is on the percent of the fluence of a burst , while for @xmath1 , the emphasis is on the transition in a grb light curve from the exponential decay in the prompt phase to the initial power - law decay . in the time interval of @xmath0 , @xmath57 of the total fluence is observed , while the ratio between the observed fluence in the time interval of @xmath1 and the total fluence depends not only on the temporal decay index of the initial power - law decay duration in the prompt component , but also on the shape of the light curve in the afterglow component .",
    "in addition , we must remember that large flares have been masked out from the light curves before performing the fit that allows us to derive @xmath1  @xcite .    as stated above , because the data are limited , there are two possible models for the luminosity relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : luminosity_relation ] ) , i.e. , the luminosity relation , using one set of values for the parameters ( the intercept @xmath23 and the slope @xmath51 ) , may be applicable to all the grbs except for some outliers . or there may be a change in the slope @xmath51 of the luminosity relation at some value of @xmath5 .",
    "if there is a change in slope this may suggest that grbs could be classified into two groups based on their values of @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath5 is an estimate of the grb duration , this is in fact an indication of how we should classify grbs into long and short ones and is actually the same as the proposal by  @xcite to use @xmath1 as the criterion for the classification of long and short grbs . in principle",
    ", we should use the quantity in the burst frame ( @xmath5 ) instead of that in the observer frame ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , for a large portion of the observed grbs , the redshifts are not available .",
    "generally speaking , due to the diversity of grbs , the classification of a grb is unlikely to be completely determined by only its time duration , not to mention that the time duration of long and short grbs overlaps near the demarcation point .",
    "let us assume the demarcation point in the burst frame for the long and short grbs to be @xmath75 then , as an approximate method , an effective redshift @xmath76 can be defined , such that grbs can be classified into long and short ones in the observer frame at @xmath77 in addition , since a similar relation does not hold if we replace @xmath1 with @xmath0 as mentioned previously , the change in the slope @xmath51 , which may be a reflection of different mechanisms , if confirmed , would favor @xmath1 over @xmath0 as a criterion for the classification of long and short grbs .",
    "we investigated the correlation between @xmath1 and the x - ray luminosity of grbs at @xmath1 and found a ( broken ) linear relation between @xmath2 and @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "there may be a change in the slope of the relation at some value of @xmath5 mainly because of the presence of the few grbs with large @xmath5 .",
    "the limited grb sample used in our analysis is still not sufficient for us to conclude whether the change in the slope is real or just an illusion caused by outliers .",
    "we considered both the cases in our analysis .",
    "if the change is real , the different slopes may be a reflection of different mechanisms for grbs , which may suggest that using @xmath1 instead of @xmath0 ( considering that a similar relation does not hold if we replace @xmath1 with @xmath0 , though @xmath0 and @xmath1 are both estimates of the grb duration ) as a criterion for the classification of long and short grbs .",
