    "the physics of neutron star cooling is based on a number of ingredients , among which the neutrino emissivity of the high  density hadronic matter in the star s core plays an important role .",

    "emission process at the early stages of the thermal evolution , the cooling simulations follow either the slow ( standard ) or the fast ( nonstandard ) scenario of thermal evolution . in the first case the dominant neutrino ",
    "radiation reactions are the modified urca and the bremsstrahlung processes . in the second case ,",
    "these are the pion ( kaon ) @xmath0decay processes , direct urca on nucleons and hyperons , as well as their analogous reactions taking place in the deconfined quark phase .",
    "the main difference in the cooling efficiency driven by these processes lies in the rather different phase spaces associated with these reactions . in the first case",
    "the available phase space is that of a two  baryon scattering process , while in the second case it is that of a one  baryon decay process .",
    "numerical simulations of neutron star cooling , incorporating these types of neutrino emission , have been extensively performed in the past ( see , for instance , tsuruta @xcite , richardson et al .",
    "@xcite , van riper @xcite , and schaab et al .",
    "these calculations suggest that the combined soft x - ray data from einstein , exosat , and rosat are roughly consistent with the slow cooling scenario , depending on the equation of state and the uncertainties associated with the behavior of super  dense matter .",
    "some pulsars , however , as for example vela and geminga , possess rather low temperatures and thus seem to call for a more rapid cooling than is obtained for the modified urca process .",
    "the fast cooling scenarios , on the other hand , generally have the tendency to underestimate the surface temperatures of these pulsars .",
    "so a natural question , motivated by these observations , is whether the physics of neutrino emission from the star s dense core will be able to resolve this problem .",
    "this will be discussed in this paper .",
    "obviously , the corresponding modifications must be such that the theoretical cooling curves describe both the hotter as well as cooler classes of pulsars , which could be linked to variations in gross  structure parameters , like the star s mass ( voskresensky & senatorov 1984 ( @xcite ) , 1986 ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to implement a number of medium  modified neutrino emissivities , which dominate a neutron star s thermal evolution , in numerical cooling simulations of such objects .",
    "we shall demonstrate that by means of this one is indeed able to achieve agreement with both the high as well as low observed pulsar temperatures .",
    "it is a well established fact that neutrino emission at the early stages of the standard evolution is dominated by the modified urca and bremsstrahlung processes .",
    "the neutrino radiation in the modified urca process was first estimated by bahcall & wolf ( @xcite ) and by tsuruta & cameron ( @xcite ) .",
    "bremsstrahlung processes dealing with the neutral currents were first evaluated by flowers et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . then the corresponding rates have been more closely studied by friman & maxwell ( @xcite , fm79 ) resulting in sufficiently higher rates .",
    "the calculation were performed in the free one  pion ",
    "exchange approximation to the long  range part of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( nn ) interaction , supplemented by a parametrization of the short  range part of the nn interaction by the landau fermi  liquid parameters .",
    "medium effects enter these rates mainly through the effective mass of the nucleons .",
    "therefore the density dependence of the rates is rather weak and the neutrino radiation from a neutron star depends only very weakly on its mass .",
    "this is the reason why the standard scenario based on the fm79 result , though complying well with a few slowly cooling pulsars , fails to explain the data of the more rapidly cooling ones .    here",
    ", we shall carry out detailed simulations of the cooling of neutron star models , which incorporate the softening of the one  pion exchange mode , other medium polarization effects , like the inclusion of the nucleon - nucleon correlations in the vertices , as well as the possibility of neutrino emission from intermediate reaction states ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also include the processes of neutrino pair radiation from superfluid nucleon pair breaking and formation mechanism first estimated by flowers et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and then more closely studied by voskresensky & senatorov ( @xcite ) and senatorov & voskresensky ( @xcite ) using the closed diagram technique .",
    "the medium modifications of these rates result in a pronounced density dependence , which , in turn , links the cooling behavior of a neutron star decisively to its mass .    using a collection of modern equations of state for nuclear matter in its ground state , which covers both relativistic as well as",
    "non  relativistic models , we shall demonstrate the robustness of the new cooling mechanisms against variations in the equation of state of super - dense neutron star matter .",
    "part of these variations are caused by the possible superfluid behavior of neutron star matter . to demonstrate this effect on the new cooling mechanisms , we proceed in three successive steps , starting from stars made up of non - superfluid matter .",
    "these models are then supplemented with superfluidity , with superfluid gap parameters taken from the literature .",
    "unfortunately , the gap energies are not very well known because of uncertainties in the effective baryon masses , the nucleon  nucleon interaction , and polarization effects ( cf .",
    "chen et al .",
    "@xcite ) . to account for these uncertainties , their values",
    "are finally varied about the theoretically determined ones .",
    "since there are also uncertainties concerning the possibility of fast cooling processes the calculations are done with both the nucleon direct urca and the @xmath0-decay processes in pion condensates ( pion urca ) and additionally without any fast cooling process .",
    "we shall show that the above mentioned medium ",
    "modifications lead to a more rapid cooling than obtained for the standard scenario .",
    "hence they provide a possible explanation for the observed deviations of some of the pulsar temperatures from standard cooling .",
    "particularly , it is shown that they provide a smooth transition from standard to nonstandard cooling for increasing central star densities , i.e. , star masses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",

    "pair breaking and formation , direct urca and pion urca processes . in sect .",

    "4 we present the results of the numerical calculations and compare them with the observed data .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in the last section .",
    "the modified urca ( mu . ] ) process is linked to neutrino emission via a weak decay of a nucleon in the presence of a bystander nucleon .",

    "fluctuation effect the pion condensation sets in via a first order phase transition ( see dyugaev @xcite , voskresensky & mishustin @xcite ) .",
    "this manifests itself in a jump of the pion gap at @xmath33 from a positive value to a negative one , see solid line in fig 2 .",
    "it has to be emphasized that the density dependence of @xmath31 is rather unknown .",
    "our choices for the parametrization are motivated by microscopic many - body calculations .",
    "somewhat different choices for the values of @xmath31 , @xmath27 and the critical density for the onset of pion condensation affect of course the resulting cooling rates .",
    "the qualitative conclusions , however , remain unchanged .",
    "indeed , as we will see below , the cooling curves for the two different parametrizations of @xmath31 do not differ very much ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : hvh_nsf ] ) .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 for @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "this parameter accounts for the changes caused by the neutrino emissivity of the modified urca process below and above the critical point where pion condensation occurs ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the factor @xmath39 takes roughly into account the suppression caused by the nucleon pairing , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the superfluid gap and the critical temperature for superfluid phase transition of neutrons .",
    "the factor @xmath42 is defined in the analogous way and takes into account the proton  proton pairing .",
    "when a neutron star cools down to temperatures in the vicinity of the critical temperature for pairing of neutrons and protons , pairing correlations play an increasingly important role in the dynamics of the star s thermal evolution .",
    "generally , the onset of superfluidity tends to slow down the cooling rate of a neutron star , since the neutrino emission processes are drastically suppressed .",
    "it enables however two additional processes as noticed in flowers et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and voskresensky & senatorov ( @xcite ) : the superfluid neutron ",
    "pair breaking and formation process ( npbf ) and the superfluid proton  pair breaking and formation process ( ppbf ) .",
    "the superfluid in a neutron star can be considered as a two  component system , which , for a fixed density and temperature , consists of paired quasiparticles in the condensate and elementary excitations above the condensate .",
    "their associated quasi ",
    "equilibrium densities are controlled by cooper ",
    "pair  formation and pair  breaking processes .",
    "these processes , which are rather frequent at temperatures in the vicinity of @xmath43 , become successively suppressed at lower temperatures , because of an exponential increase in the number of paired particles . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph2 ] , these processes proceed with the emission of neutrino pairs via the reactions @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes the cooper pair , @xmath47 an excitation .",
    "the respective emission rates can be calculated either in terms of the closed diagram formalism , using the normal and anomalous green s functions for the paired nucleons , or in terms of the method of bogoliubov s transformations applied to reaction rates in the normal ground state .",
    "as far as one works in the quasiparticle limit , which is an excellent approximation for neutron star matter , the preference for one or the other method is primarily a matter of taste .",
    "however , in a broader context , the green s functions method provides a more general treatment by allowing for off - mass - shell effects and a systematic diagrammatical representation of the approximations to the self - energy functions ( scattering rates ) .",
    "a first estimate of the reaction rates was given by flowers et al .",
    "( @xcite ) using the bogoliubov s transformations .",
    "it was recalculated by voskresensky & senatorov ( @xcite ) using closed diagram technique .",
    "voskresensky & senatorov have also included the contribution of the axial vector coupling and used different parameterizations of the weak coupling vertices .",
    "this results in a rate being higher by an order of magnitude .",
    "besides the npbf process , the ppbf process was considered , too .",
    "one finds in lowest order of the expansion parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 and @xmath50 are the fermi  energies of neutrons and protons , respectively ) for the neutron and proton components ( see voskresensky & senatorov @xcite ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 ^ 2 }   \\nonumber\\\\    & \\simeq & e^{-2x}\\sqrt{\\pi /4x }",
    "\\quad { \\rm for } \\quad x=\\delta /t   \\gg 1 ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be seen that in the limit @xmath53 , the rate of these processes is exponentially suppressed , as it is the case for the two  nucleon process considered above .",
    "however , because of mild phase space restrictions ( we deal here effectively with a one  nucleon phase  space volume ) these processes may considerably contribute to the neutrino emissivity of the neutron star .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath54 depends only on the ratio @xmath55 . for @xmath56pairing",
    "the maximum value is equal to @xmath57 , for @xmath58pairing it is @xmath59 .",
    "this causes the emissivity of the npbf process in the core ( @xmath58paring ) to be smaller by three orders of magnitude ( for equal gap energies ) compared to the emissivity in the crust ( @xmath56pairing ) .",
    "along with the two processes described above we include in the numerical calculations other relevant channels of neutrino emission , too . though we shall see that the processes described above lead to `` _ intermediate _ ''",
    "cooling rates , it still appears useful to distinguish between `` _ standard cooling _ '' and `` _ nonstandard _ '' or `` _ fast cooling _ '' , depending on whether the predominant process is the modified urca process or a faster one , as nucleon or hyperon direct urca , processes in pion- or kaon - condensed matter , or those caused by the presence of quarks in dense matter .    as examples of a fast cooling processes",
    ", we shall use the nucleon direct urca ( du ) and the pion urca ( pu ) processes .",
    "these processes are rather representative for other fast processes .",
    "indeed , all the fast cooling processes lead qualitatively to the same temperature dependence of the emissivity , @xmath60 .",
    "moreover the values of the critical densities beyond which these processes are possible are close to each other .",
    "the du processes @xmath61 can only occur if the proton fraction exceeds some critical value ( about 1113  % depending on the composition ) in order to fulfill energy and momentum conservation ( see boguta @xcite and lattimer et al .",
    "in contrast to nonrelativistic eos s ( e.g. uv@xmath62+uvii ) which predict proton fractions that lie below these critical values , relativistic eos s contain sufficiently large proton fractions such that the direct urca process becomes possible .",
    "however , the proton fraction depends crucially on the symmetry energy which is unfortunately not well known at higher densities .",
    "we shall use the emissivity calculated by lattimer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , however corrected by the suppression factor @xmath63 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) ) accounting for the nucleon ",
    "nucleon correlations in the weak interaction vertex ( for simplicity , we assume the same suppression factor in all vertices , cf .",

    "[ sec : finres ] , where the final results are discussed , whereas it is neglected in the other cooling curves in order to demonstrate the efficiency of mu - vs86 and npbf and ppbf- processes .",
    "even more uncertain is the possibility of the hyperon direct urca ( see prakash et al .",
    "@xcite ) . whereas the contribution of the hyperon direct urca is small compared to the contribution of the nucleon direct urca in the non superfluid case",
    ", the hyperon direct urca might become important if the nucleons form superfluid pairs .",
    "if however the hyperons become also superfluid , then their contribution is again neglible .",
    "the superfluid phase transition of hyperons has unfortunately not been studied so far since it is rather difficult to implement superfluidity in relativistic treatments with hyperons .",
    "we therefore neglect this contribution to the neutrino emissivity .",
    "the pion condensation was suggested by migdal ( @xcite ) , scalapino ( @xcite ) , and sawyer ( @xcite ) and then considered by many authors ( e.g. brown & weise @xcite , migdal @xcite , and migdal et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in the last years",
    ", some arguments against the occurrence of pion condensation in neutron stars were given in the literature ( see , for instance , brown et al .",
    "these arguments are generally based on the rather strong increase of the landau - migdal parameter @xmath65 with the nucleon density .",
    "however other effects which might be important for the pion condensation problem ( cf .",
    "migdal et al .",
    "@xcite ) were not incorporated .",
    "thus one may conclude that the question whether a pion condensate occurs in neutron stars is still not settled ( see ericson & weise @xcite and kunihiro et al .",
    "@xcite for extensive reviews ) .",
    "we shall therefore use models both with and without pion condensates applying two parametrizations of @xmath31 ( see sect .",

    "additionally the neutrino emissivity in kaon condensation , which is now favored by various authors ( e.g. brown et al .",
    "@xcite and thorsson et al .",
    "@xcite ) as well as the critical density for the onset of condensation are quite similar to the case of pion condensation . the additional @xmath66-factor in the kaon condensation case , where @xmath67 is the cabibbo  angle , is partly compensated by a probably larger value of the suppression - factor @xmath68 due to a possible suppression of the correlations between strange and non - strange baryons .",

    "superfluidity strongly suppresses the neutrino emission rates from stars containing a superfluid core , which thus delays cooling . as it was the case for standard cooling ,",
    "the thermal evolution of superfluid stars is rather insensitive against variations of the star s mass .",
    "however , as soon as charged pions condense in the core of a neutron star , superfluidity disappears and the much higher neutrino emission rates cause the cooling curves to drop down by more than two orders of magnitude . for the model which allows for pion condensation",
    ", this occurs when the star s mass is varied from 1.6 to 1.7 @xmath130 . in principle , it appears possible to achieve agreement between the body of observed cooling data and the cooling simulations by properly varying the star s mass in an extremely narrow range .",
    "surely , such a procedure is not very satisfying because it requires an extreme fine  tuning of the mass of a star . as we shall see below",
    ", the superfluid state allows for other neutrino  emitting processes which decisively influence the cooling of stars and thus provide other , less stringent conditions by means of which agreement with the observed data can be achieved .",
    "to demonstrate the relevance of the superfluid pair breaking and formation processes for the cooling of neutron stars , in the first step , we implement these two processes into standard cooling calculations . in these calculations the fm79 result for the modified urca process is used .",

    "[ fig : hvh_sfpair ] .",

    "the du process is taken into account in the right graph , whereas it is neglected in the left graph .",
    "the solid curves refer again to the @xmath79parameterization with phase transition to a pion condensate , the dashed curves to the one without phase transition . for masses in the range between 1.0 and 1.6 @xmath130 ,",
    "the cooling curves pass through most of the data points .",
    "we again recognize a photon luminosity drop by more than two orders of magnitude of the 1.7 @xmath130 mass star with pion condensate , due to vanishing of the superfluidity as a consequence of pion condensation .",
    "this drop is even larger if the du is taken into account ( right graph , this allows to account for the photon luminosity of psr 1929 + 10 ) .",
    "a comparison with the observed luminosities shows that one gets quite good agreement between theory and observation if one assumes that the masses of some of the underlying pulsars are different from the canonical value , @xmath136 .",
    "since the masses of these pulsars are not known , no further conclusions about the actually operating cooling mechanism of these pulsars can be drawn yet .",
    "future mass determinations of these objects will change the situation .",
    "the only two stars whose photon luminosities can not be accounted for by the new processes studied here are the rather hot pulsars psr 1055 - 52 and psr 1951 + 32 .",
    "again , as mentioned above , their temperatures may be explained by internal heating .    to explore the impact of somewhat smaller superfluidity gaps on cooling",
    ", we arbitrarily reduced the gap by a factor of 6 .",
    "its major effect is a drop in the cooling curves of the 1.0 to 1.6 @xmath130 mass stars and of the 1.7 and 1.9 @xmath130 mass stars without pion condensate ( dashed curves ) .",
    "this would lead to better agreement with the low  temperature pulsar 0630 + 18 ( geminga ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hvh_all_sf2 ] ) .",
    "so far we have selected a particular model for the equation of state of neutron star matter , i.e. hv , and studied the dependence of the cooling curves on the star s mass .",

    "the general qualitative features obtained for hv carry over to this case , except that the temperature drop occurs now at a lower mass threshold .",
    "for that reason the 1.1 @xmath130 mass star is already anomalously cold . because of the relatively high neutron fraction of the uv@xmath62+uvii compared to relativistic eos s the superfluid phase does not reach to the center of the @xmath137 mass star in this particular model of amundsen & stgaard ( @xcite ) .",
    "this causes the luminosity drop to occur also for the model without pion condensate ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the high neutron fraction , or identically the low proton fraction , has also the effect that the du process can not occur .",
    "the cooling curves constructed for rbhf , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rbhf_all_sf ] , are rather similar to those of uv@xmath62+uvii though the underlying microscopic theories employed to determine these two models for the equation of state are completely different .",
    "we recall that the former , rbhf , is based on a parameter  free relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock calculation while the latter , uv@xmath62+uvii , was derived in the framework of a non - relativistic many - body variational calculation . in both cases , however , dynamical nucleon - nucleon correlations are taken into account , which  as a general feature  tend to soften the equation of state at intermediate nuclear densities , both in the relativistic as well as in the non - relativistic case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eos ] ) .",
    "for that reason both of these models for the equation of state lead to similar slopes of star mass as a function of central star density ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] ) and similar cooling behaviors . with respect to the differences between rbhf and uv@xmath62+uvii ,",
    "the former is harder than the latter .",
    "therefore the magnitude of the temperature drop for increasing star masses is smaller . for both of these models ,",
    "pion condensation set in at rather low neutron star masses , causing already the rather light neutron stars ( @xmath138 ) to cool very rapidly .",
    "in contrast to the uv@xmath62+uvii eos , the rbhf has large proton fractions at high densities causing the superfluid phase to reach to the center of the star for all star masses and allowing for the du process .",
    "the cooling tracks for the @xmath79parameterization without pion condensation and the ones with the du process are similar to the cooling tracks for the hv eos .",
    "thus , we can restrict ourselves to the pion condensation case without du process .    besides hv , we employ a second model , labeled g@xmath87 , for the equation of state derived in the framework of relativistic mean  field theory .",
    "both equations of state are rather similar , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : eos ] and [ fig : mass ] , and so are the corresponding cooling curves , fig .",
    "[ fig : g300_all_sf ] .",
    "again only the pion condensation case without du process is studied .",
    "two recalculated neutrino - emitting processes in dense neutron star matter , i.e. , the modified urca process and the superfluid pair breaking and formation processes , have been implemented in numerical cooling simulations of neutron stars .",
    "our major finding is that standard cooling processes supplemented with the medium effects enables one to achieve theoretical agreement with a large fraction of the observed pulsar luminosities , which  subject to uncertainties in the equation of state and transport properties of superdense matter  seems to be a problem for the standard cooling scenario alone ( cf .",

    "it is possible to account for the low temperatures of psrs 0833 - 45 ( vela ) , 0656 + 14 , and 0630 + 18 ( geminga ) .",
    "secondly , the new processes studied here provide a crossover between standard cooling and the so  called fast cooling scenarios of neutron stars and thus can be viewed as `` _ _ intermediate _ _ '' cooling scenarios .",
