    "recent advances in nanotechnology have ignited the study of surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) , which have become a popular topic @xcite due to their wide range of potential applications in surface - enhanced raman scattering ( sers ) @xcite , surface enhanced second harmonic generation , nano - photonics @xcite , thermal - photovoltaic devices @xcite , and data storage and imaging @xcite    however , finding a way to excite and control spps in an advantageous manner is still the main concern of scientists .",
    "the technology available to control spps with precision and flexibility remains underdeveloped , and different schemes have been proposed in this regard .",
    "for example , since the discovery of extraordinary transmission @xcite , major interest has centered on investigating cylindrical hole arrays in which subwavelength hollow cylinders are periodically formed on a flat metal film using lithographic methods @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite , however , has demonstrated showed that the shape of an individual cavity in metallic grating plays a dominant role in controlling the excitation of spps .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed that there are shape and localized resonances in two - dimensional ( 2d ) periodic subwavelength metallic cavity arrays .",
    "as a result , different shapes can lead to different resonances because the holes act like plasmonic cavities to confine the electric field and thereby give rise to strong localized resonances @xcite .",
    "understanding the geometry effects of cavities can lead to a number of applications that require the precise spatial and frequency control of an enhanced electric field , such as sers and thermal radiation .",
    "however , scientists have only a limited understanding of the surface shape resonances , and the correlation between spp excitation and cavity geometry has not been widely investigated until recently @xcite . in a recent work , we reported the fabrication of 2d nano - cavity arrays on a gold surface using interference lithography ( il ) @xcite . in this article , we focus on a theoretical study of 2d nano - cavity arrays by using finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) simulation @xcite methodology .",
    "our particular focus is on the symmetric properties and polarization dependence of excited spps",
    "we consider a model system that contains a gold slab drilled with a 2d array of cylindrical cavities .",
    "it is convenient to define the unit cell shown in fig .",
    "[ structure ] with suitable boundary conditions .",
    "periodic boundary conditions ( pbcs ) are applied in both the @xmath2- and @xmath3-directions to produce a periodic structure . to account for non - periodicity in the @xmath4-direction , the perfectly matched layer ( pml ) @xcite boundary condition is adopted in the @xmath5-directions .",
    "in addition , certain parameters are fixed throughout the study .",
    "for example , we only examine optical wavelengths that range from @xmath6  nm to @xmath7  nm .",
    "moreover , the thickness of the gold layer is set at @xmath8 @xmath9 m to ensure that the structure can be considered to be optically thick and such bulk photonic effects as fabry - prot resonance and guiding mode resonance @xcite are substantially reduced and negligible . finally , the spatial and time resolution are @xmath10 nm and @xmath11 , respectively , and the two lattice constants are fixed at @xmath12  nm .",
    "gold processes complex electron inter - band transitions at infrared frequencies . as a result ,",
    "simple dielectric functions such as the drude model , which considers only the electric response of conduction electrons , may not be adequate for modeling the dielectric response of gold . in this work , the multiple drude - lorentz model proposed by @xcite is adopted : @xmath13 here , index @xmath14 represents the contribution to the dielectric function made by the electrons of different bands ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the frequency and damping parameters ; @xmath17 is the high - frequency response , which is originated by the screening of the core electrons ; and , finally , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the static dielectric response contributed by the different electron bands .",
    "equation  ( [ drude - lorentz ] ) is fitted against the measured dielectric function of gold @xcite , and the fitted parameters are tabulated in table [ table2 ] .",
    "figure [ fit ] shows both the measured and fitted dielectric functions .",
    "as can been seen , eq .",
    "( [ drude - lorentz ] ) agrees well with the measured @xmath20 throughout our frequency range of interest .    .(color",
    "online ) fitted parameters for eq .",
    "[ drude - lorentz ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      to calculate the dispersion relation , several gaussian sources are placed within the simulation cell .",
    "these gaussian sources have a frequency width that covers the entire optical frequency range .",
    "they are randomly located so that all of the resonant modes of the system can be excited . after turning off the sources ,",
    "some fields are left in the system to allow their magnitudes to be recorded as a finite - length signal .",
    "this signal is then expressed as the sum of a finite number of sinusoids with exponentially decaying factors in a given bandwidth .",
    "the frequencies , decay constants , amplitudes , and phases of these sinusoids are determined from the coefficients of the sum .",
    "furthermore , line sources pointing in the @xmath21-direction are used to allow an investigation of the effects of different polarizations on the dispersion relations .",
    "these sources can be classified as @xmath22-polarized or @xmath23-polarized , depending on whether it is the magnetic field ( @xmath24 ) or electric field ( @xmath25 ) that pointis in the @xmath21-direction , respectively .",
    "some of the resonant modes shown in fig .",
    "[ cylindrical : band : r75 ] correspond to wood s anomalies @xcite .",
    "wood s anomalies occur when one diffracted order is parallel to the structure surface , which results in energy redistribution to the other diffracted orders . in other words ,",
    "the incident light is scattered in parallel to the structure surface .",
    "this causes a sudden change in reflectance when the frequency ( @xmath26 ) and in - plane wave vector ( @xmath27 ) of the incident light satisfies @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the incident wave - vector , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the reciprocal lattice vectors , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are integers .",
    "additionally , we can trace the spps by plotting their dispersion relation driven by the following equation @xmath34 it can be seen that eq .",
    "( [ spp.dispersion.relation ] ) agrees well with the remaining excited modes of the @xmath22-excited resonances for @xmath35 = @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , whereas only the @xmath38-type resonances are present for @xmath23-polarization .",
    "this is due to the fact that the array has @xmath39 point group symmetry .",
    "the eigenstates with @xmath29 parallel to the @xmath40-@xmath41 direction are irreducible representations of point group @xmath42 @xcite , and each eigenstate is either symmetric ( @xmath43 mode ) or antisymmetric ( @xmath44 mode ) under a mirror transformation along the @xmath45-@xmath4 plane and can be excited only by incident waves that have the same symmetric property .",
    "these are , as is discussed in appendix [ symmetric.operation ] , @xmath22- and @xmath23-polarized lights , respectively .",
    "furthermore , it is proven that only a symmetric eigenstate is present for ( @xmath46 ) = ( @xmath0 ) and ( @xmath47 ) , but that , on the contrary , both symmetric and antisymmetric eigenstates exist for ( @xmath46 ) = ( @xmath1 ) . therefore , the black dotted lines shown in figs . [ cylindrical : band : r75](a ) and ( b ) represent the eigenstates of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 symmetries , respectively .",
    "we are now in a position to present the field density distribution of the various excited spp modes . guided by the dispersion relations",
    ", we have located the wave - vectors and frequencies of these excited modes at @xmath48 , @xmath49 for the @xmath22-excited resonance from fig . [",

    "[ cylindrical : band : r75](b ) , respectively , and have calculated their corresponding near field intensities . to calculate field intensity , a plane - wave gaussian source is put above the array at @xmath51  @xmath9 m to mimic an incident beam .",
    "the source has a narrow frequency width , such that it simulates a single - frequency incident plane wave .",
    "in addition , a spatially dependent amplitude function , exp(@xmath52 ) , is added to the source , where @xmath27 is the in - plane wave - vector , such that the angle of incidence is given by @xmath53 .",
    "this simulation provides us with useful information on the way in which the incident light interacts with the array and the physical properties of the excited resonances .",
    "time - domain simulations provide information about both the transient and steady states .",
    "we focus on the steady states by calculating the spectral field density of an excited mode at specified @xmath27 , @xmath26 values : @xmath54 consider the time - average of energy density , as follow @xmath55 spectral field density is a single @xmath26 component of @xmath56 .",
    "theoretically , we need to sum up all of the @xmath26 components .",
    "however , as the gaussian source used has only a narrow frequency width , @xmath57 , the component of the specified central frequency , @xmath58 dominates the integral . by assuming the other @xmath59 components are weak ,",
    "that is , @xmath60 we have @xmath61 in addition , @xmath62 also provides information about the harmonic eigenstate with a specified @xmath27 and @xmath58 .      in this section",
    ", we present the calculated field densities of the excited ( @xmath63)-spps and discuss their symmetry properties . a general discussion of the symmetric properties of the eigenstates @xcite is given in appendix [ symmetric.operation ] .",

    "[ cylindrical : e : s : r75](a)(d ) , respectively .",
    "the colors indicate field strength , which ranges from 080 arbitrary units ( a.u . ) . the cavity is outlined with black dotted lines .",
    "as can been seen in fig .",
    "[ cylindrical : e : p : r75](a ) , strong electric fields are distributed along the @xmath45-axis ( @xmath65 ) , with the strongest being concentrated near the rim of the cavity .",
    "this is in accordance with eqs .",
    "( [ even.odd.explicit.ex])([even.odd.explicit.ez ] ) , where @xmath66 [ fig .",
    "[ cylindrical : e : p : r75](b ) ] and @xmath67 [ fig .",

    "[ cylindrical : e : p : r75](c ) ] is anti - symmetric .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 along @xmath65 and @xmath70 .",
    "in contrast , the field is asymmetric along the @xmath71 plane , which is due to the propagating nature of the excited spp mode @xcite .",
    "when calculating the @xmath64 , two kinds of electric fields are present in the system : one is the electric field of the resonant mode , labeled @xmath72 , and the other is the electric field of the incident light , labeled @xmath73 . according to group theory , these two electric fields should have the same symmetric properties under @xmath42 symmetric operations .",
    "the @xmath22-polarized light contains an electric field at the incident plane ( the @xmath45-@xmath4 plane ) whose time average is always symmetric along the @xmath65 plane , but asymmetric along the @xmath71 plane . as a result ,",
    "the resultant field density , @xmath64 , is asymmetric along the @xmath71 plane .    to further investigate the @xmath22-excited @xmath38 spp",

    "it should be noted that the @xmath45-component of the electric field is very weak at @xmath71 , and is mainly concentrated at ( @xmath79 ) , which suggests that the local field should , at least to the first order , be dominated by point dipole - like distribution , ( that is , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the total dipole moment along the @xmath45-axis .",
    "this is in accordance with the hypothesis of @xcite , who treats each cavity as a resonator that consists of a simple capacitor , an inductor and resistance .",

    "it should be noted that the field densities of @xmath84 and @xmath85 are very similar . however , as is revealed in figs .",
    "[ cylindrical : exy : field : s : r75](a)(b ) , @xmath82 and @xmath78 are actually very different from each other .",
    "moreover , it should also be noted that @xmath78 can be attributed to an effective dipole along the @xmath21-axis . in other words , @xmath86 , which is similar to the case for @xmath82 in the @xmath22-excited ( @xmath1 ) mode [ figs .",
    "[ cylindrical : e : p : r75](a ) and [ cylindrical : exy : field : p : r75](a ) ] .",
    "the present analysis relies only on the knowledge of @xmath39-point group symmetry , which should be valid for any plasmonic structure that belongs to the same point group .",
    "therefore , our argument can be applied to all @xmath39-point group structures , such as square cavities , cross - shape grooves , circular crafters , pyramidal structures @xcite , and bottle - shape cavities @xcite .",
    "additionally , spp excitation along the @xmath40-m direction also has similar symmetric properties @xcite , and the corresponding eigenmodes can also be classified into even and odd modes , which are excited by @xmath22- and @xmath23-polarized light accordingly .    to sum up",
    ", we have performed fdtd analysis on a gold cylindrical cavity array and investigated the excited ( @xmath1 ) mode based on the symmetry argument .",
    "although very close in resonance frequencies , the even and odd modes display very different types of behavior in terms of field distribution , which has important implications for near - field applications such as sers .",
    "it is hoped that this work will provide insight into the fields of plasmonics and nano - optics .",
    "the eigenfunctions , @xmath87 , of a periodic plasmonic structure at eigenfrequency @xmath26 are bloch functions that satisfy the master equation @xcite : @xmath88 where @xmath29 denotes wavevectors within the first brillouin zone .",

    "the vector fields are transformed by operator @xmath92 , defined as @xmath93 and thus , @xmath94 however , vectors defined by cross products are transformed differently .",
    "for example , for magnetic field @xmath95 , @xmath96 to preserve the transformation properties of the force and velocity , the magnetic field is transformed as follows @xmath97 electric fields and magnetic fields are transformed in different ways under the mirror transformation .   + it is well known that @xmath98 commutes with @xmath92 for periodic structures : @xmath99 also , if @xmath100 , then we have @xmath101 and @xmath102 that is , the eigenmode is either symmetric ( @xmath103 ) or antisymmetric ( @xmath104 ) under mirror transformation along the @xmath45-@xmath4 plane .",
