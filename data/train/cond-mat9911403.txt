    "the nature of phase transitions in frustrated systems are generally found to be quite different from those in conventional magnets.@xcite frustration often leads to non - trivial ground state degeneracies as in the case of the antiferromagnetic spin 1/2 ising model on the triangular lattice .",
    "@xcite the classical heisenberg model on the two dimensional triangular lattice with antiferromagnetic nearest neighbour coupling and easy axis exchange anisotropy is another example where frustration leads to a novel ground state degeneracy .",
    "miyashita and kawamura@xcite(mk ) have investigated both the ground state and the nature of harmonic excitations at low temperatures in this model . at zero temperature",
    "the spins lie in a plane which contains the easy @xmath0-axis .",
    "in addition to the @xmath1 degeneracy related to the rotation of this plane about the @xmath0-axis , there is also a non - trivial @xmath1 degeneracy of the ground state related to rotations of the spins within the plane .",
    "the planar spin configuration distorts as it is rotated about an axis normal to the plane but the energy remains constant .",
    "this degeneracy is not broken by the harmonic excitations . using monte carlo methods",
    ", mk measured the specific heat as well as various susceptibilities and suggested that the system undergoes two successive phase transitions as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the two transitions indicated the onset of power law correlations of the spin - spin correlation functions parallel and perpendicular to the easy axis .",
    "more recently , sheng and henley@xcite have examined both the effects of finite temperature and quantum fluctuations on this non - trivial degeneracy .",
    "they predicted that the continuous degeneracy at finite temperatures @xmath2 is reduced to a discrete six - fold degeneracy and that an additional phase transition from a floating phase to a locked phase occurs at a temperature in between the upper and lower transitions for large values of the easy axis anisotropy .    in the present work",
    ", we use a direct method to study the free energy cost of both spin wave and vortex formation in this system at low temperatures .",
    "we define a spin stiffness and a vorticity modulus in terms of an equilibrium correlation function which can be evaluated using standard monte carlo methods .",
    "our results indicate that there are only two transitions and that both correspond to vortex unbinding transitions accompanied by power law decay of spin correlations .",

    "we shall consider the case where the parameter range a @xmath7 1 represents an easy axis anisotropy .",
    "the limit @xmath8 corresponds to the isotropic heisenberg model@xcite whereas the limit @xmath9 corresponds to an infinite spin ising model.@xcite southern and xu@xcite have previously studied the heisenberg limit and found direct evidence for a vortex unbinding transition at finite temperature even though the spin stiffness vanishes on large length scales .",
    "this latter fact indicates that the spin correlations decay exponentially at all finite temperatures @xmath2 .",
    "this behaviour is quite different from that which occurs in the corresponding two - component @xmath10 model@xcite where power law decay of the correlations appear at low temperatures .",
    "the triangular lattice can be decomposed into three sublattices @xmath11 and @xmath12 as shown in figure 1 with the three spins on each triangle labelled as @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "a chirality vector@xcite for each upward pointing triangle is defined as follows @xmath15    in the present case of the easy axis antiferromagnet , the low temperature spin configuration on each triangle has the spins lying in a plane which includes the @xmath0-axis and which is perpendicular to the chirality vector . we introduce a local spin space coordinate system for each upward pointing triangle using the three unit vectors @xmath16 and @xmath17 . hence the vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 lie in the spin plane and @xmath20 is the local normal to the plane .",
    "the @xmath18 is a global axis for all triangles whereas the @xmath20 are only all aligned at @xmath21 . as @xmath2 increases , the local normal directions fluctuate and the spin plane develops curvature .",
    "hence local coordinates are needed to properly define the response properties of the system .",
    "information about the rigidity of the system against fluctuations can be obtained from the spin wave stiffness coefficient .",
    "the spin stiffness ( helicity ) tensor is given by the second derivative of the free energy@xcite with respect to the twist angle about a particular direction in spin space .",
    "we apply a twist about each of the local axes defined above and the corresponding average stiffness is given by @xmath22 [ s_i^\\beta s_j^\\gamma -   s_i^\\gamma s_j^\\beta ] ) ^2 \\rangle \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the superscipts take the values @xmath23 and @xmath24 are to be taken in cyclic order .",

    "the number of spins is related to the linear size @xmath29 of the cluster as @xmath30 .",
    "we have used a single spin - flip heat bath algorithm@xcite to update the spin directions at each monte carlo step and all thermal averages are replaced by time averages . for the largest value of the system size @xmath31 studied we discard the first @xmath32 monte carlo steps and perform averages over the next @xmath33 steps .",
    "the values of the stiffnesses at zero temperature can be evaluated using the exact classical ground state correlation functions .",
    "we find these values to be @xmath34 these three stiffnesses satisfy a perpendicular axis theorem which is consistent with the ground state being a planar spin arrangement . in the heisenberg limit",

    "these limiting values can also be obtained from the harmonic excitation spectrum.@xcite    figure 3 shows the results obtained for the three stiffnesses as a function of @xmath39 for various system sizes @xmath29 with @xmath40 . as the temperature increases towards @xmath41 , the stiffness corresponding to the smaller energy scale , @xmath42 , decreases abruptly and a strong dependence on system size @xmath29 is evident indicating that above this temperature the system has no rigidity against twists of the spins about the easy axis .",
    "mk suggested that this transition corresponds to the unbinding of vortices associated with the chirality vector which lies primarily in the @xmath10 plane .",
    "we will provide further support for this interpretation in section iv .",
    "the remaining two stiffnesses do not vanish at @xmath43 but do exhibit a rapid decrease followed by a more steady decrease until a higher temperature @xmath44 . at this higher temperature",
    ", the strong dependence of the stiffness @xmath45 on system size @xmath29 indicates that the system loses rigidity against rotations about the local chirality axes .",

    "the dashed line in figure 3 corresponds to @xmath48 and intersects the stiffnesses at temperatures where finite size effects first appear .",
    "the stiffnesses @xmath42 and @xmath45 indicate two temperatures where rigidity of the system about the @xmath0-axis is first lost followed by a loss of rigidity about the local chirality axis with an apparent universal value for the ratio @xmath49 in each case .",
    "the third stiffness @xmath50 has a change in curvature at the two transitions but remains finite to high temperatures .",
    "similar behaviour is found for other values of @xmath36 as well",

    "the dashed line plotted in both figures corresponds to @xmath48 and in each case this line intersects the stiffnesses at the temperatures where finite size effects first become significant .",
    "these results indicate that the ratio @xmath46 appears to have the universal value @xmath52 for both stiffnesses for all values of @xmath53 .",
    "we have used this criterion to estimate the values of @xmath43 and @xmath54 .    in the same way that the spin stiffness is a measure of the response of the spin system to a twist over the length of the lattice",

    "@xmath64 we can extract the vorticity modulus @xmath65 defined as follows @xmath66 using @xmath67 where the @xmath68 are normalized so that they have the same zero temperature values as the corresponding stiffnesses .",
    "our approach does not require any change in boundary conditions and is applied directly to the antiferromagnetic model .",
    "figure 5 shows our results for the vorticity moduli obtained by comparing systems of different sizes when @xmath40 .",
    "the behaviour of the moduli as a function of increasing temperature is identical to the spin stiffnesses shown in figure 3 .",
    "the vorticity modulus @xmath69 is only weakly sensitive to the two transitions and is not plotted .",
    "the vanishing of the vorticity moduli @xmath70 and @xmath71 at @xmath43 and @xmath54 respectively indicates that free vortices appear at these two transition temperatures .",
    "the results are also consistent with a universal value @xmath72 .",
    "similar behaviour is found for the values @xmath73 .",
    "the results presented so far do not indicate directly that power law decay of correlations are present below these two transition temperatures . in the next section we present results for the spin - spin structure factor which are also consistent with kt transitions .",
    "we have also studied the spin - spin structure factor for various system sizes @xmath29 @xmath74 where @xmath75 . in particular , we have studied @xmath76 and @xmath77 as a function of both @xmath78 and @xmath2 . in both cases",
    "the fourier component @xmath79 exhibits a divergence at and below the two transition temperatures @xmath43 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "other values of @xmath78 only exhibit a maximum .",
    "this fourier component corresponds to the three - sublattice structure associated with the triangles .",
    "if we assume power law decay of the spin - spin correlation functions , then the structure factors should depend on the system size @xmath29 as follows @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the corresponding correlation length exponents .",
    "figure 6 shows the values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 as a function of @xmath39 obtained by comparing systems of different sizes with @xmath40 .",
    "the dashed line indicates the value @xmath85 predicted by the kt theory and intersects both exponents at temperatures where a strong dependence on system size first appears .",
    "similar results were obtained for other values of @xmath36 .",
    "the universal value of @xmath86 is consistent with the universal value of @xmath87 and @xmath72 obtained in section ii .",
    "we have used these two criteria to obtain the temperatures @xmath88 and @xmath89 as a function of @xmath36 as shown in figure 7 .",
    "the values obtained from the stiffnesses and the structure factors agree with each other fairly well .",
    "the error bars in @xmath90 reflect contributions from the statistical uncertainty of the monte carlo measurements , as well as estimated systematic contributions due to finite size effects .",
    "if we make the simple assumption that the dependence of @xmath43 and @xmath54 on @xmath36 is the same as the zero temperature values of @xmath42 and @xmath50 respectively , then we have @xmath91 where the values of @xmath43 and @xmath54 in the isotropic limit @xmath92 are both equal to @xmath93.@xcite these expressions are plotted as the solid curves in figure 7 and the agreement with the data points is remarkable .    the limit @xmath9 of the present model is equivalent to the @xmath94 limit of the antiferromagnetic spin @xmath95 ising model on the same lattice with coupling @xmath96 . the solid curve for @xmath54 approaches the value @xmath97 in this limit .",
    "this value is also in excellent agreement with that obtained by nagai et al.@xcite for the @xmath98 ising model . in the next section",
    "we give a more detailed microscopic description of these phases .",
    "the three spins @xmath13 and @xmath99 on each triangle can be expressed in terms of the following three vectors @xmath100 the vectors @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the real and imaginary parts of the complex fourier component @xmath103 where @xmath79 .",
    "in addition , the chirality for each triangle can be written as @xmath104 .    in the ground state",
    "the three spins lie in a plane which includes the @xmath0-axis .",
    "we denote the angle that each sublattice spin makes with the @xmath0-axis by @xmath105 , and define @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "we measure @xmath108 relative to the @xmath0-axis in the counter - clockwise direction .",
    "as discussed by sheng and henley@xcite , the nontrivial degeneracy of the ground state can be parameterized in terms of the angle @xmath108 .",
    "it has been previously pointed out that both the energy and the magnitude of @xmath109 are constant in the ground state manifold@xcite .",
    "however , it is easy to show that the modulus of the complex vector @xmath110 is also constant . in the appendix",
    "we give some exact results for the components of these vectors in the ground state .",
    "the @xmath111 components of these two vectors depend on @xmath108 in quite different ways",
    ". the components of @xmath109 have periodicity @xmath112 whereas the vectors @xmath101 and @xmath102 have period @xmath113 .",
    "figure 8 shows ground state spin configurations of the sublattices in the @xmath111 plane for values of @xmath108 in the range @xmath114 .",
    "the top row corresponds to @xmath40 and the bottom row to @xmath9 .",
    "also shown are the corresponding directions of @xmath115 and @xmath116 which are independent of the value of @xmath36 .",
    "rotations of the angle @xmath108 by @xmath117 correspond to interchanges of the sublattice spin directions and to a complete rotation of @xmath109 by @xmath113 .",
    "hence vortex - like configurations of @xmath109 simply correspond to switches of the sublattice magnetizations . for large values of the easy axis anisotropy ,",
    "the spin configurations become more ising - like . in the range @xmath118 ,",
    "sublattices @xmath36 and @xmath119 remain locked parallel to the easy axis while sublattice @xmath12 simply follows @xmath109 . in the range @xmath120",
    ", the roles are interchanged with sublattice @xmath36 following the direction of @xmath109 .",
    "these sublattice changes as a function of @xmath108 are similar to the domain transition regions described by wannier@xcite for the @xmath121 ising model at @xmath21 . in this latter case ,",
    "the transition regions contribute to the macroscopic entropy of the system and to the power law decay of correlations with wavevector @xmath122 .",
    "@xcite    the moduli of the complex numbers @xmath123 and @xmath124 are not constant in the ground state but the combination @xmath125 has constant modulus and a phase angle @xmath126 which has a leading term linear in @xmath108 but with an additional small 6-fold modulation . at low temperatures the chirality vector lies in the @xmath10 plane and it can be described by the complex number @xmath127 where the modulus is not constant but exhibits only a weak @xmath128 variation in the ground state .",
    "these two phase angles @xmath129 and @xmath126 describe the complex order parameters associated with the transitions at @xmath43 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "our monte carlo procedure permits us to take snapshots of the spin configurations at various temperatures . in order to separate the topological defects from the continuous deformations of the spin configurations ,",
    "we first raise the temperature to some fixed value and allow the system to reach equilibrium .",
    "we then rapidly quench the system to low temperatures and allow the system to approach a nonequilibrium configuration .",
    "the topological defects are metastable at low temperatures and require a much longer time to disappear than the continuous deformations . in figures 9 and 10 we show snapshots of the spin configuration at very low temperatures obtained by heating the system above @xmath43 and @xmath54 respectively and then rapidly quenching . in both cases , ( a ) describes the spatial variation of the chirality angle @xmath129 and ( b ) describes the angle @xmath108 .",
    "figure 9 shows snapshots of the spin configuration for a cluster of size @xmath130 with @xmath40 after quenching from a temperature of @xmath131 , just above @xmath43 .",
    "vortices associated with the angle @xmath129 are clearly visible in ( a ) whereas only continuous distortions of the angle @xmath108 are visible in ( b )",
    ". these vortices in @xmath129 only persist at low @xmath2 if the system is first heated to a @xmath132 and then quenched .",
    "they are metastable configurations at this lower temperature but become stable at @xmath43 .",
    "our results provide direct evidence for a vortex unbinding transition at @xmath43 involving the chirality vector .",
    "figure 10 shows similar snapshots when the system is first heated to a temperature @xmath133 , well above @xmath54 , and then rapidly quenched .",
    "vortices in both @xmath129 and @xmath108 are clearly visible in this case .",
    "the vortices in @xmath108 are only visible after quenching from above @xmath54 .",
    "hence the upper transition corresponds to a vortex unbinding transition associated with the sublattice ordering vector @xmath110 .",
    "we have also studied how the sublattice magnetizations change as we update the spin configurations . in the temperature range",
    "@xmath134 there is a continuous sublattice switching that occurs .",
    "the time scale for the switching depends both on @xmath2 and system size @xmath29 increasing with @xmath29 and @xmath135 .",
    "we have not been able to determine a scaling form for this time scale .",
    "similar behaviour has been reported previously for other frustrated systems on the triangular lattice .",
    "the antiferromagnetic spin @xmath136 ising model with both nearest and next - nearest neighbour interactions@xcite as well as the antiferromagnetic @xmath98 nearest neighbour model@xcite exhibit this phenomena in the temperature range where a kt phase occurs . in our case ,",
    "the switching is due to the wave - like variations in @xmath108 which can produce `` vortex - like '' variations in the local magnetization vector @xmath109 . in the range of @xmath36 that we have studied ,",
    "we have not observed a transition from sublattice switching to a partially ordered phase where one of the sublattices is locked in the @xmath137 direction , another in the @xmath138 direction and the third perpendicular to the @xmath0-axis .",
    "sheng and henley@xcite predicted that such a locking transition might occur at low enough temperature .",
    "we have presented strong evidence for the occurence of two distinct kosterlitz - thouless types of defect - mediated phase transitions in the heisenberg antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice with easy axis anisotropy .",
    "a numerical approach was used to calculate the rigidity of the system against both spin wave deformations and the formation of free vortices at low temperatures for several values of the easy axis anisotropy . in each case a universal value of the stiffness or vorticity modulus , @xmath139 , was found .",
    "in addition , the spin correlation length exponent has the universal value @xmath85 .",
    "these are the same values that are predicted by the kosterlitz - thouless theory for defect unbinding transitions in two dimensions .",
    "the two phase angles identified in equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) in section iv describe the complex order parameters associated with the transitions at @xmath54 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "we find that the spin stiffnesses and the corresponding vorticity moduli behave identically for the easy axis case @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast , at the isotropic heisenberg limit , the spin stiffness vanishes at large length scales whereas the vorticity moduli are non - zero at low t and vanish abruptly at a finite temperature.@xcite our previous work on the @xmath10 model @xcite also indicated that the vorticity and stiffness behave identically .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath140 limit where there are again two transitions but they are very close in temperature with the upper transition corresponding to an ising - like transition and the lower to a kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "recent work by capriotti et .",
    "@xcite has also found similar behaviour in the range @xmath141 .",
    "hence the heisenberg point is a multicritical point where four phase transition lines meet . for @xmath53",
    "there are two kt transition lines whereas as for @xmath142 there is an ising and kt line .",
    "this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
    "miyashita and kawamura@xcite were the first to identify the nontrivial degeneracy of the ground state configuration .",
    "other groups@xcite have studied the effects of quantum fluctuations on this degeneracy .",
    "one indicator of the degeneracy is that the magnetization vector @xmath109 has a constant magnitude in the ground state independent of the value of @xmath108 .",
    "in particular we find the following exact relations @xmath143 where @xmath108 is measured counter - clockwise from the @xmath0-axis in the @xmath111 plane .",
    "a rotation of @xmath109 by @xmath113 corresponds to rotating @xmath108 by @xmath117 which is simply a cyclic permutation of the sublattices on the triangle .",
    "hence vortices in @xmath109 can be associated with sublattice switching .",
