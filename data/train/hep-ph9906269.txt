    "we study the impact of isospin violation on the extraction of @xmath1 from an isospin analysis in decays  @xcite .",
    "isospin is broken not only by electroweak effects but also by the @xmath4 and @xmath5 quark mass difference .",
    "the latter drives @xmath6 mixing  @xcite , which , in turn , generates an amplitude in not included in the isospin analysis .",
    "thus , although the effect of electroweak penguins is estimated to be small  @xcite , when all the effects of isospin violation are included , the error in the extracted value of @xmath1 can be significant  @xcite .    to review",

    "if isospin were perfect , then the bose symmetry of the @xmath28 @xmath29 state would permit amplitudes merely of @xmath30 , so that the amplitudes @xmath31 would be purely @xmath32 . in this limit the penguin contributions are strictly of @xmath33 character , so that they can not contribute to the @xmath32 amplitude : no cp violation is possible in the @xmath34 final states . the penguin contribution in @xmath17 , or in @xmath35 , can then be isolated and removed by determining the relative magnitude and phase of the @xmath36 to @xmath32 amplitudes .",

    "although electroweak penguin contributions are estimated to be small  @xcite , other isospin - violating effects , such as mixing , can be important  @xcite .    to include the effects of mixing , we write the pion mass eigenstate @xmath51 in terms of the su(3)@xmath52-perfect states @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , where , in the quark model , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and latexmath:[$|\\phi_0\\rangle=    explicit relations between the physical and su(3)@xmath52-perfect states can be realized by expanding qcd to leading order in @xmath59 , momenta , and quark masses to yield a low - energy , effective lagrangian in which the pseudoscalar meson octet and singlet states are treated on the same footing  @xcite .",
