    "in nonholonomic mechanics a special attention is given to the systems whose equations of motion after suitable reduction yield conformally hamiltonian vector field , which can be studied by the standard methods of hamiltonian mechanics after an appropriate time reparameterization , see reviews @xcite and the references therein .",
    "for instance , because the generic level set of the integrals of motion is independent of time , we can study symmetries of this manifold simultaneously for hamiltonian and non - hamiltonian vector fields associated with this level set .",
    "the main our aim is to obtain bcklund transformations ( bt ) for the nonholonomic veselova system @xcite .",
    "historically , the bcklund transformations originate in differential geometry in the 1880s and , in particular , they arose as certain transformations between surfaces . in the theory of integrable systems , according to classical definition by darboux @xcite , a bcklund transformation ( bt ) between the two given pdes @xmath0 is a pair of relations [ ff - bk ] f_1,2(u , x , t,,,)=0 and some additional relations between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which allow to get both equations @xmath3 and @xmath4 , see details in @xcite .",
    "the bt is called an auto - bt or a hetero - bt depending whether the two pdes are the same or not .",
    "auto bts are used to generate solutions of the given partial differential equation , starting from known solutions , even trivial ones .",
    "the hetero bts describe a correspondence between two different pde s rather than a one - to - one mapping between their solutions .    in classical mechanics ,",
    "auto bt of the hamilton - jacobi partial differential equation @xmath5 is a canonical transformation of variables [ btrans ] b:(u , p_u)(,_u ) on the phase space @xmath6 preserving the form of this hamilton - jacobi equation @xcite .",
    "there are also other definitions associated with lax pair @xcite or with the corresponding algebraic curve @xcite , but we prefer to use definition related to the hamilton - jacobi equation itself .",
    "a comprehensive definition of hetero bt is also not yet available .",
    "some examples the hetero bts relating different hamilton - jacobi equations were considered in @xcite .    for many integrable by quadratures dynamical systems in holonomic and nonholonomic mechanics",
    "one faces the abel quadratures , which for the veselova system with were obtained in original paper @xcite . in these cases solutions of equations of motion",
    "are given by jacobi inversion of abel quadratures and the corresponding abel map allows us to relate the generic level set of integrals of motion with the jacobian @xmath7 of some algebraic curve @xmath8 , which has a well - studied group structure .",
    "it also allows us to consider original variables @xmath9 and their images @xmath10 on @xmath6 as coordinates of two reduced divisors @xmath11 and @xmath12 on @xmath7 and to identify any auto bt ( [ btrans ] ) with a composition of suitable group operations @xmath13 d=\\tilde{d}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 $ ] denote equivalence , addition and scalar multiplication by an integer and @xmath17 is an auxiliary divisor depending on arbitrary parameters",
    ".    in @xcite cantor proposed a concrete algorithm for performing computations in jacobian groups of hyperelliptic curves which consists of two stages : the composition stage , which generally outputs an unreduced divisor , and the reduction stage , which transforms the unreduced divisor into the unique reduced divisor .",
    "now we have a lot of algorithms and their professional computer implementations for the divisor arithmetics on low , mid and high - genus curves , for generic divisor doubling , tripling etc , see references in @xcite .    in hamiltonian mechanics ,",
    "authors usually consider only full degree divisors @xmath18 and weight one divisor @xmath17 in ( [ add - jac ] ) that makes the reduction stage of cantor s algorithm trivial . this partial group operation and the corresponding auto bts have been studied from the different points of view in many publications , in particular see @xcite and references therein .",
    "in fact , this very special construction of auto bts was developed for simplest one - parametric discretization of original continuous systems .",
    "below we discuss auto bts associated with addition of two generic divisors and with generic divisor doubling when reduction coincides with inversion .",
    "these auto bts represent hidden symmetries of the level manifold which yields new canonical variables on original phase space and , therefore , we can use these new variables to to construction of new integrable systems , i.e. to construction of hetero bts . in our opinion",
    "it is natural to use different types of auto bts for the different purposes .",
    "following @xcite , consider the motion of the rigid body with a fixed point under nonholonomic constraint [ rel - ves ] ( , ) = 0 . here",
    "@xmath19 is the vector of the angular velocity in the body frame , @xmath20 is a unit vector which is fixed in a space frame , @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the scalar and vector products in @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "isomorphism of this system with the system describing the motion of a nonhomogeneous ball without slipping and twisting on a plane was found in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "a standard form of the equations of motion describing rotation of a rigid body around a fixed point is the following : [ ves - eqm ] = , = m+ .",
    "the last term in the second equation in ( [ ves - eqm ] ) is related to condition that projection of the angular velocity @xmath24 to a fixed vector @xmath25 must zero ( [ rel - ves ] ) .",
    "here @xmath26 is the vector of kinetic momentum of the body , expressed in the body frame .",
    "this frame is firmly attached to the body , its origin is in the body s fixed point , and its axes coincide with the principal inertia axes of the body .",
    "the inertia tensor of the body in this frame is diagonal @xmath27 using the equations of motion ( [ ves - eqm ] ) and constraint ( [ rel - ves ] ) we can calculate lagrangian multiplier @xmath28 @xmath29 equations of motion ( [ ves - eqm ] ) determine vector field @xmath30 on the manifold @xmath31 with coordinates @xmath32 : [ z - ves ] z_i = z_i , i=1,,6 .",
    "vector field @xmath30 possesses four independent first integrals [ int - ves ] h_1=(m , ) , _ 2=(m , m)-(,m)^2,_1=(,)=1,_2=(,)=0 , and an invariant measure [ rho - ves ] = gd dm,= ( , a ) ^1/2=. hence , it is integrable by quadratures according the euler - jacobi theorem @xcite .    in order to get these quadratures",
    "we introduce the following poisson bivector on @xmath6 [ poi - ves ] p= (    0 & 0 & 0 & & _",
    "3(g+ ) & -_2(g- ) + 0 & 0 & 0 & -_3(g- ) & & _ 1(g+ ) + 0 & 0 & 0 & _ 2(g- ) & -_1(g+ ) & + * & * & * & 0 & & - + * & * & * & - & 0 & + * & * & * & & - & 0 +    ) , where vector @xmath33 is equal to @xmath34 this bivector @xmath35 may be obtained using chaplygin method of reducing multiplier @xcite , poisson reduction on lie groups @xcite or the turiel deformations of the canonical poisson structures @xcite .",
    "it is easy to prove that vector field @xmath30 ( [ z - ves ] ) is a conformally hamiltonian vector field on the phase space @xmath36 @xmath37 where hamiltonain @xmath38 is given by ( [ int - ves ] ) .    in the next section we present auto and hetero bcklund transformations for these vector fields @xmath30 and @xmath39 having a common level set of integrals of motion .",
    "according @xcite we can integrate original equations of motion ( [ ves - eqm ] ) after change of time @xmath40 , i.e. after transition from conformally hamiltonian vector field @xmath30 to hamiltonian vector field @xmath39 .",
    "indeed , let us introduce variables @xmath41 and @xmath42 using equations [ ves - gamma ] _",
    "i=,ijk and [ ves - m ] m_i=((i_i - u_1)p_u_1-(i_i - u_2)p_u_2 ) , where @xmath43 is a totally skew - symmetric tensor . in this variables poisson bivector ( [ poi - ves ] ) has the following form @xmath44 i.e. variables @xmath41 and @xmath42 are canonical variables [ poi1 ] \\{u_i , p_u_j}=_i , j,\\{u_1,u_2}=\\{p_u_1,p_u_2}=0 .",
    "we can identify @xmath41 with the standard elliptic or spheroconical coordinates on the unit sphere [ ves - def - u ] + + = , i_k= the defining equation ( [ ves - def - u ] ) should be interpreted as an identity with respect to @xmath45 , and for each set of elliptic coordinates @xmath41 it is possible to solve ( [ ves - def - u ] ) for @xmath46 by calculating the residues at @xmath47 .",
    "notice also that ( [ ves - def - u ] ) implies @xmath48 and @xmath49 , so that the elliptic coordinate system is orthogonal , and the coordinates @xmath41 take values only in the intervals @xmath50 in geometry using a simultaneous rescaling of the coordinates and the parameters , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , it is always possible to take @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in mechanics @xmath55 are the some fixed momenta of inertia which can not be changed .",
    "the corresponding momenta [ ves - def - pu ] p_u_1,2=(+ + ) _ x = u_1,2 differ on standard expressions of momenta via angular momentum by the factor @xmath56 in the denominator .",
    "it would do no harm us to identify phase space @xmath6 with the cotangent bundle @xmath57 of the unit sphere @xcite .    in this canonical variables",
    "@xmath57 original hamiltonians ( [ int - ves ] ) are equal to [ ves - ham - u ] h_1=+h_2=+ , where [ ves - phi ] ( u)=4u(1-a_1u)(1-a_2u)(1-a_3u ) .",
    "to describe evolution of @xmath58 with respect to @xmath59 we use the canonical poisson bracket ( [ poi1 ] ) and expressions for @xmath60 to obtain @xmath61 and @xmath62 to solve the hamilton - jacobi equations @xmath63 with respect to @xmath42 @xmath64 and to substitute these expressions into ( [ ves - eq1]-[ves - eq2 ] ) one gets standard abel quadratures [ ves - ab - q1 ] + = 2dt_2,+=2dt_1 , on the hyperelliptic curve @xmath8 of genus two defined by equation [ ves - eq - c ] c : y^2=f(x),f(x)=4x(a_1x-1)(a_2x-1)(a_3x-1)(h_1x - h_2 ) .",
    "thus , we can identify the generic level set of the first integrals for the veselova system with a symmetric product @xmath65 and later with jacobi variety @xmath7 of hyperelliptic curve @xmath8 of genus two @xcite .",
    "it is a starting point in the construction of the auto and hetero bcklund transformations of the veselova system .",
    "multidimensional generalizations of the veselova problem of a nonholonomic rigid body motion and abel quadratures for the corresponding hamiltonian vector fields are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we can directly apply these quadratures to construction of the bcklund transformations in the framework of the abel theory @xcite .",
    "suppose that transformation of variables [ st - b - ves]b:(u_1,u_2,p_u_1,p_u_2)(_1,_2,_u_1,_u_2 ) preserves hamilton equations ( [ ves - eq1]-[ves - eq2 ] ) and the form of hamiltonians ( [ ves - ham - u ] ) .",
    "it means that new variables satisfy to algebraic equations @xmath66 and differential equations [ ves - ab - q2 ] + = 2dt_2,+=2dt_1 .",
    "subtracting ( [ ves - ab - q2 ] ) from ( [ ves - ab - q1 ] ) one gets two abel differential equations @xmath67 where [ xy - ves ] x_1,2=u_1,2,y_1,2=(u_1,2)p_u_1,2,x_3,4=_1,2,y_3,4=-(_1,2)_u_1,2 and @xmath68 form a base of holomorphic differentials on hyperelliptic curve @xmath8 of genus two @xmath69 here we change sign of @xmath70 by using standard hyperelliptic involution @xmath71 . historical perspective and modern geometric meaning of abel differential equations",
    "are discussed in @xcite .",
    "abel equations are closely related with the group law in the jacobian of the corresponding algebraic curve @xcite .",
    "in fact , there are two main methods for deriving the group law in jacobian of hyperelliptic curve : the algebraic method @xcite based on harley s formulation of cantor s algorithm , and the geometric method using interpolation of points @xcite , which is based on clebsch s geometric formulation of the abel theorem . in both cases , we can either use an abstract modern language of algebraic geometry , which is somewhat difficult to understand experts in mechanics , physics , practical cryptography etc , either use some trivial geometric construction , which allow us to get the necessary explicit formulae .",
    "for the low - genus hyperelliptic curves and the corresponding mechanical systems it is easy to explain all the necessary explicit formulae in the framework of the classical abel theory , i.e. without the modern abstractions applicable to all the possible cases .",
    "indeed , let us consider abel differential equations ( [ ab - eq - g2 ] ) on the genus two hyperelliptic curve [ eq - c ] c : y^2=a_5x^5+a_4x^4+a_3x^3+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0 . according to abel s idea , solutions @xmath72 are abscissas and ordinates of the points of @xmath8 intersecting with the second plane curve defined by equation [ eq - p ] y - p(x)=0,p(x)=b_3x^3+b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0 .",
    "in our case four points of intersection @xmath73 are solutions of abel equations ( [ ab - eq - g2 ] ) , whereas two remaining points @xmath74 are arbitrary . using this freedom",
    "we can suppose that ( see figure 1 ) :    1 .",
    "points @xmath74 are given at some fixed finite positions ( three full degree divisors ) ; 2 .",
    "one point @xmath75 is at infinity ( two full degree divisors and divisor weight one ) ; 3 .",
    "points @xmath74 coincides with @xmath76 ( generic divisor doubling ) .",
    "there are other reduced divisors on @xmath7 @xcite . here",
    "we consider only divisors associated with the given integrable system with two degrees of freedom ( [ ves - eq1]-[ves - eq2 ] ) .",
    "examples of auto bts associated with reduced divisors at case 1 and at case 2 may be found in @xcite .",
