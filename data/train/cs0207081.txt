    "an _ inversion _ of @xmath0 is a bijection generated by a circle , that maps circles to circles and preserves angles between pairs of curves .",
    "the circle with center @xmath1 and radius @xmath2 gives an inversion as follows : each point @xmath3 along a ray with origin @xmath1 is mapped to another point @xmath4 along the same ray , so that the product of the distances @xmath5 and @xmath6 is @xmath7 .",
    "thus points on the circle remain fixed and the center @xmath1 maps to @xmath8 .",
    "the set of products of inversions forms a group , the group of _ mbius transformations _ on euclidean space @xmath9 .",
    "mbius transformations arise in data visualization .",
    "for example , hyperbolic browsing  @xcite uses the poincar model of the hyperbolic plane to view large graph structures .",
    "a change of focus in a hyperbolic browser is given by an isometry of hyperbolic space corresponding to a mbius transformation of @xmath9 that maps the unit disk to itself  @xcite .",
    "brain mapping  @xcite flattens a convoluted surface by mapping it quasiconformally to a disk ; subsequent navigation in the brain map can be accomplished by hyperbolic browsing . for these applications ,",
    "it is reasonable to ask for computational primitives specially designed for compatibility with mbius transformations .",
    "we previously considered the problem of finding an optimal mbius transformation for viewing hyperbolic or spherical data  . in this paper",
    "we give a mbius - invariant method of extending a function defined only at discrete sample points to a continuous function defined everywhere on their convex hull .",
    "let @xmath10 be a set of points in @xmath9 , and let @xmath11 be another point in the convex hull of @xmath12 .",
    "assume we have real- or complex - valued `` elevation '' @xmath13 for each @xmath14 , and we would like to define an elevation @xmath15 at @xmath11 , such that @xmath16 is a continuous function of @xmath11 and @xmath17 .",
    "natural neighbor interpolation  @xcite sets @xmath18 to be a convex combination of the @xmath13 values at the _ natural neighbors _ ( also known as delaunay or vorono neighbors ) of @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the vorono cell of @xmath11 in the vorono diagram of @xmath20 ( that is , the set of points in @xmath9 closer to @xmath11 than to any @xmath14 ) , and let @xmath21 denote the vorono cell of @xmath14 in the vorono diagram of @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the fraction of @xmath19 covered by @xmath21 .",
    "see figure  [ vorfigs](a ) .",
    "sibson  @xcite showed that the weights @xmath23 act as a sort of local coordinate system for @xmath11 in the sense that if @xmath24 and @xmath25 , then @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "sibson s theorem also implies that natural neighbor interpolation reconstructs linear functions , that is , if @xmath28 for each @xmath29 and some @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath1 , then @xmath32 .",
    "natural neighbor interpolation is a logical starting point for mbius - invariant interpolation , because the notion of vorono neighbor can be made invariant under mbius transformations .",
    "two sites @xmath14 and @xmath33 are _ extended vorono neighbors _ if there is a circle @xmath34 through @xmath14 and @xmath33 bounding either an empty disk or empty disk complement .",
    "after an inversion , @xmath34 or its complement remains empty and thus @xmath14 and @xmath33 are still neighbors .",
    "what do we do with the weights @xmath23 ?",
    "area changes under mbius transformations , so we must find an invariant alternative : angle .",
    "the angle most obviously associated with natural neighbor @xmath14 is the angle at the _ lune _ formed by maximal empty circles , as shown in figure  [ vorfigs](b ) .",
    "we use the exterior lune angles @xmath35 , because the sum of these angles is fixed : @xmath36 .",
    "( one way to see this fact is to perform an inversion that takes @xmath11 to @xmath8 ; the exterior lune angles become the exterior angles around the convex hull of the transformed point set . ) for invariance , we can simply set @xmath23 to be proportional to any function of angle , @xmath37 . but is there some especially natural choice for @xmath38 ?",
    "first , we would like the interpolation to be continuous as @xmath39 , so we require @xmath40 as @xmath41 .",
    "second , we would like the interpolation to reconstruct some class of functions , analogous to linear functions in sibson s method . harmonic functions ( solutions to laplace s equation @xmath42 ) would be high on anyone s wish list , because of numerous applications ( heat , electrostatics ) and because the family of harmonic functions is itself invariant under mbius transformations .",
    "the values of a harmonic function on a discrete point set , however , do not determine the function , so we can not hope for a property as strong as sibson s theorem .",
    "we instead ask for a property that holds only in the limit .",
    "let @xmath43 be a set of points on a circle @xmath34 , and let @xmath44 be the maximum angle of arc between a pair of successive @xmath14 s . let @xmath11 be a point interior to @xmath34 , and let @xmath35 be the exterior lune angle between @xmath11 and @xmath14 as above .",
    "now let @xmath16 be a harmonic function defined on the closed disk bounded by @xmath34 .",
    "then as @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "there is a mbius transformation that puts the image of @xmath11 at the center of the image of circle @xmath34 .",
    "now the harmonic measure of an arc of a disk with respect to the disk center is proportional to its arc angle ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "it is not hard to confirm that in the limit of small arcs , the arc angles are the same as the exterior lune angles .",
    "thus @xmath47 is the sum over small arcs of harmonic measure times the value of @xmath48 at a point in the arc ; this sum converges to the limit @xmath49 .",
    "thus in summary we would like the weighting function @xmath37 to go to infinity as @xmath41 and @xmath50 to go to a constant as @xmath51 .",
    "the most obvious choice is to make @xmath37 proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "we normalize the weights so that they sum to one , and thus the actual weights are @xmath53 , where @xmath54 .",
    "natural neighbor interpolation using weights proportional to @xmath52 gives a continuous function @xmath18 that interpolates the elevations at sample points and , in the limit of dense samples on a circle , reconstructs harmonic functions .",
    "open questions include : is there a nice @xmath55 continuous version ?",
    "( one idea is to weight by @xmath56 , but this loses the harmonic function property . )",
