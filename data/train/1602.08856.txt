    "recent exciting developments in condensed matter physics concern a variety of topological phases . these are phases that are not classified by broken symmetries and local order parameters  @xcite .",
    "while the term `` topological phases '' was originally used to refer only to topologically ordered gapped phases with long - range entanglement , it is now understood to encompass a broader class of phases .",
    "this includes symmetry - protected topological phases  @xcite  gapped states with no long - range entanglement that are distinct from the trivial phase only in the presence of certain symmetries  and now frequently even gapless states  @xcite .",
    "the prototypical gapless topological phase of matter is the nodal semimetal in which nodal points act as sources and sinks of berry s phase making them topologically stable .",
    "such states are realized in certain phases of liquid helium and have been discussed extensively in that context  @xcite , while their condensed matter realization in the 3 + 1d weyl semimetals is a very recent experimental achievement  @xcite .",
    "the non - trivial topological structure is induced by spin - orbit coupling",
    ". the surface states corresponding to a pair of weyl nodes disperse chiraly and result in open fermi surfaces  the fermi arcs .",
    "the presence of these exotic surface states is closely related to quantum anomalies which also govern the unusual response of the system to external fields  @xcite .",
    "whether strong electronic correlations can stabilize exotic cousins of nodal phases is the open question that motivates our work .    one fruitful strategy to describe and analyze unconventional 3 + 1d gapless states of matter",
    "is inspired by the fact that a boundary between gapped phases , one topological and another one not , is expected to be gapless  .",
    "accordingly , the first key idea of this manuscript is to approach the putative fractional weyl semimetal as a surface state of a higher - dimensional gapped topological state , namely that of a 4 + 1d fractional quantum hall state  @xcite .",
    "previous studies have described such a state in terms of landau levels for dirac fermions in higher dimensions  @xcite , quaternions  @xcite , and ground state wave functions  @xcite .",
    "our understanding of these phases , however , is still much less advanced in comparison to their 2 + 1d counterparts .",
    "while some general results , such as the connection between charge fractionalization and a non - trivial ground state degeneracy in a gapped 2 + 1d system on a torus  @xcite , should carry through in higher dimensions , other aspects of topological order , including for example exotic quasiparticle statistics , are much less transparent . describing the 4 + 1d fractional quantum hall state , although not the main goal of this study , will therefore be a useful spin - off that adds to the existing body of knowledge of this state .    in this work ,",
    "we combine the above strategy  approaching a putative fractional 3 + 1d metallic state as the surface state of a fractional 4 + 1d quantum hall state  with a second powerful approach , the so - called coupled - wire construction .",
    "the advantage of the combined strategy is that , unlike previous parton constructions  @xcite , it does not postulate fractionalization from the start , allows us to address both the gapped bulk and the gapless surfaces of a 4 + 1d quantum hall state , and remains analytically tractable .",
    "the main idea is to trade the isotropy usually inherent to low - energy topological quantum field theories for the analytical control over electron - electron interactions provided by luttinger liquid theories describing ( coupled ) one - dimensional systems . starting with the seminal studies @xcite ,",
    "coupled - wire constructions have been successfully employed to describe a large variety of chiral topological phases in 2 + 1d @xcite , including surfaces of topological 3 + 1d states @xcite , topological superconductors @xcite , and spin liquids @xcite .",
    "first generalizations of the coupled - wire approach to higher dimensions have been discussed in  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we adapt the coupled - wire construction for the description of topological 4 + 1d phases , and apply it to a specific class of 4 + 1d fractional quantum hall states  .    in the next section",
    "we summarize our main results and discuss the main ideas .",
    "this section is aimed at those readers that are not experts in coupled - wire constructions but are interested in the main ideas behind the calculation .",
    "all the technical details are given in section  [ sec : cwc_field ] and require some background knowledge ; those not interested in these details can safely skip this section and go directly to the discussion in section  [ sec : discussion ] , where we also discuss the connection to current experimental prospects .",
    "in this section we discuss the general philosophy and the key ideas of our work ; the technical details of our calculation are given in the next section .",
    "the central result of our work is a coupled - wire construction of a 4 + 1d fractional quantum hall insulator that has 3 + 1d fractional chiral metals at its surfaces , and the conjecture of a fractionalized gapless 3 + 1d phase composed of two fractional chiral metals of opposite chiralities .",
    "the 4 + 1d quantum hall insulator we construct has a current density response @xmath0 to an external electromagnetic field @xmath1 given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 with integer @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the totally antisymmetric tensor ( here and henceforth we use units where @xmath7 ) .",

    "this result we interpret as the chiral anomaly induced response of a surface 3 + 1d fractional chiral metal .",
    "this fractional chiral metal interpretation is motivated by an analogy with the edge states in the 2 + 1d fractional quantum hall effect . there , the 2 + 1d hall current can be understood as arising from a chiral charge that is pumped from one edge to the other .",
    "the chiral charge is therefore not separately conserved on each edge and the theory describing a given edge is anomalous .",
    "the change in chiral charge is proportional to the electric field inducing the hall current , with a coefficient that is a fraction of that obtained in the noninteracting integer case .",
    "analogously , the response   represents the pumping of chiral charge from one anomalous 3 + 1d metallic surface to another . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the coefficient of this anomaly is fractionalized with respect to the well - known coefficient of the chiral anomaly of noninteracting weyl fermions , which is obtained for @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "we thus define the obtained surface state as a fractional chiral metal .",
    "the fundamental idea of our construction is as follows : a 4 + 1d quantum hall state is constructed by regularly stacking 3 + 1d weyl semimetals along a fourth spatial direction at @xmath19 , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 the lattice spacing . by suitably coupling nodes of opposite chiralities in neighboring weyl semimetals the bulk is gapped out , as shown schematically in fig .",

    "instead , they form 3 + 1d chiral gapless surface states that are higher dimensional analogues of the chiral 1 + 1d edge modes of a 2 + 1d quantum hall state . like these modes , they escape the fermion doubling theorem  @xcite by the fact that they live on the 3 + 1d surfaces of a topological 4 + 1d state .",
    "we therefore identify the gapped state just constructed as an integer 4 + 1d quantum hall state .    in the presence of interactions",

    "the way this essentially works is that one of the dimension in the weyl semimetal , say @xmath41 , is made into effective one dimensional quantum wires by quenching the kinetic energy along the other @xmath42 and @xmath43 directions .",

    "this we recognize as the action of a 2 + 1d quantum hall effect edge described by @xmath59 with an extra functional dependence @xmath60 that , as above , has its origin in the landau level degeneracy .",

    "the application of a strong magnetic field has the advantage of allowing us to identify the dominant couplings at the microscopic level , leading to a well defined phase .",

    "regarding the first point , our construction of the 4 + 1d quantum hall effect has two advantages : i ) it naturally incorporates by construction the chiral anomaly at the boundary and ii ) it provides a natural way to write down the boundary field theory , one of our main results .",

    "this way , we find that the fractional chiral metal existing at each edge of the 4 + 1d fractional quantum hall effect pumps chiral charge to the opposite boundary through the bulk , only now the magnitude of this phenomenon is a fixed fraction of that corresponding to the non - interacting case of weyl semimetals .    an important ingredient of our coupled - wire construction is the selection of the wire axis by the applied magnetic field , which quenches the kinetic energy in the @xmath269-plane . alternatively , one could stack weyl semimetals with strongly anisotropic weyl nodes , in which the velocity in a given direction , @xmath41 for instance , is much larger than the rest , e.g. , the @xmath269-plane . treating the motion in this plane as a perturbation to the dominantly one - dimensional motion along @xmath41",
    ", we have checked that correlated tunnelings analogue to the ones depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : weyl_b_scattering ] can lead to a bulk gapped state with gapless edge modes . in the integer quantum hall case ,",
    "the edge modes recover a single anisotropic weyl node per surface once the weak dispersion in the @xmath269-plane is taken into account . in the fractional case",
    ", the edge modes do not correspond to free fermions , but still exhibit an anisotropic three - dimensional dispersion .",
    "finally , our work opens a number of future directions .",
    "the coupled - wire construction can be naturally generalized to incorporate non - abelian states  @xcite and it would be appealing to define topological defects with anyonic statistics in chiral 3 + 1d metals  @xcite . what is missing at this point is a microscopic hamiltonian that can support a fractional chiral metal as its ground state .",
    "our construction has defined such a state , thus making the first step toward realization of this novel phase of matter ; we expect our work to trigger further research in strongly correlated metallic topological phases .",
