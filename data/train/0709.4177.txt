    "understanding the nature of the explosion mechanism of type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) is important for the use of sne ia as precision cosmological probes as well as for stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis .",
    "determining something about the nature of the explosion will almost certainly shed light on the physical explanation of the empirical light curve shape ",
    "luminosity relationship @xcite as well as further physical parameters associated with the observed diversity in the sn  ia population . understanding the physical nature of the diversity is crucial in being able to estimate systematic errors that may arise in comparing the characteristics of the nearby sample with the cosmological one .    while there is widespread agreement that the sn  ia progenitor consists of a c+o white dwarf that accretes material from a companion and ignites the c+o fuel when the chandrasekhar mass is reached , the exact mechanism of explosion",
    "is not known .",
    "the explosion could take the form of a super - sonic detonation ( shock - wave ) , or a sub - sonic deflagration . if a unexpanded chandrasekhar mass wd detonates , the resulting products would be almost entirely @xmath0 and @xmath1-particles @xcite , contrary to the signature intermediate mass elements of silicon , sulfur , and calcium that define the sne  ia class .",
    "for many years the standard sn  ia model has been the 1-d , parameterized , deflagration model w7 @xcite . in that model the speed of the flame was adjusted in order to reproduce the approximately correct amount of @xmath0 , as well as intermediate mass elements .",
    "nevertheless , the central regions of the model undergo significant electron capture and far too much neutron - rich material is produced , polluting the interstellar medium .",
    "@xcite showed that with pf - shell model calculations the electron capture rates are reduced over those of standard sd - shell rates of @xcite ( @xcite ) , we are unaware of hydrodynamical calculations that show that the problem is completely solved . in order to avoid some of the problems of w7 ,",
    "the delayed - detonation model has gained significant favor @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the ignition begins as a deflagration , allowing the star to pre - expand , before the deflagration transforms into a detonation at lower densities , which produces both @xmath0 and intermediate mass elements .",
    "while this process is known to occur in confined terrestrial situations , it is not known whether it can take place in the unconfined white dwarf .",
    "the last decade has seen the beginning of full 3-d hydro calculations @xcite .",
    "much of the work has focused on pure deflagration models as well as developing the necessary sub - grid techniques to handle the essentially infinite dynamic range ( due to turbulence ) or studying the effects of differing numbers of ignition points .",
    "the initial ignition conditions may well be unknowable since about one hundred years before ignition the white dwarf becomes turbulent @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been general agreement that pure deflagration models leave behind significant amounts of unburnt carbon and oxygen and that the kinetic energy of the explosion is too low to reproduce the observed spectra of normal sne  ia @xcite .",
    "the alternative is a delayed detonation @xcite where the deflagration accelerates into a detonation or some other process that turns the deflagration into a detonation .",
    "two alternatives that act in a similar manner to the delayed - detonation scenario are the `` gravitationally confined detonation '' @xcite and the `` pulsating reverse detonation '' @xcite",
    ".    we present detailed nlte synthetic spectral calculations of an angle averaged version of prd5.5 a pulsating - reverse - detonation calculation ( e.  bravo & d.  garca - senz , in preparation ) .",
    "the detailed chemical composition was determined from the hydro model with a post - processing code that included a maximum of 725 isotopes .",
    "the evolution of the electron fraction @xmath2 was followed along with the hydrodynamic calculation with the aid of tables of electron capture rates in nse matter .",
    "the procedure was identical to that used in @xcite .",
    "the calculations were performed using the multi - purpose stellar atmospheres program ` phoenix `  version 15 @xcite .",
    "version 15 incorporates many changes over previous versions used for supernova modeling @xcite including many more species in the equation of state ( 83 versus 40 ) , twice as many atomic lines , and many more species treated in full nlte . `",
    "phoenix `  solves the radiative transfer equation along characteristic rays in spherical symmetry including all special relativistic effects .",
    "the non - lte ( nlte ) rate equations for many ionization states are solved including the effects of ionization due to non - thermal electrons from the @xmath3-rays produced by the radiative decay of @xmath4ni , which is produced in the supernova explosion .",
    "the atoms and ions calculated in nlte are : h  i , he  i  ii , c  i - iii , o  i - iii , ne  i , na  i - ii , mg  i - iii , si  i  iii , s  i  iii , ca  ii , ti  ii , fe  i  iii , ni  i - iii , and co  i - iii .",
    "these are all the elements whose features make important contributions to the observed spectral features in sne  ia .",
    "each model atom includes primary nlte transitions , which are used to calculate the level populations and opacity , and weaker secondary lte transitions which are included in the opacity and implicitly affect the rate equations via their effect on the solution to the transport equation @xcite .",
    "in addition to the nlte transitions , all other lte line opacities for atomic species not treated in nlte are treated with the equivalent two - level atom source function , using a thermalization parameter , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the atmospheres are iterated to energy balance in the co - moving frame ; while we neglect the explicit effects of time dependence in the radiation transport equation , we do implicitly include these effects , via explicitly including the rate of gamma - ray deposition in the generalized equation of radiative equilibrium and in the rate equations for the nlte populations .",
    "the outer boundary condition is the total bolometric luminosity in the observer s frame .",
    "the inner boundary condition is that the flux at the innermost zone ( @xmath6  @xmath7 ) is given by the diffusion equation .",
    "we treat the @xmath3-ray deposition by solving the full radiative transfer for a grey opacity .",
    "detailed fitting of the observed spectra determines all the parameters .",
    "` phoenix `  has been well tested on sne  ia @xcite and particularly on sn  1994d @xcite . `",
    "phoenix `  is subjected to rigorous regression testing with each new version .",
    "in the pulsating reverse detonation model @xcite the deflagration starts in a number of rising plumes that are already somewhat close to the surface .",
    "these plumes burn without much expansion of the white dwarf and hence burn to iron peak elements .",
    "the energy released by this initial deflagration is not enough to unbind the star and the outer parts fall back producing an accretion shock .",
    "the unburnt core settles back into equilibrium and the accretion shock detonates the outer parts which are at low enough density that they burn to intermediate mass elements .",
    "thus the composition structure in this model is not completely stratified and the outer layers are polluted by iron and radioactive nickel .",
    "the precise amount of polluting fe - group elements is sensitive to the outcome of the deflagrative phase of the explosion , more efficient subsonic burning reduces the amount of stable fe - group pollution .",
    "the mass fraction of radioactive material close to the surface of the ejecta depends as well on the amount of electron captures that , in turn , are a sensitive function of the central density at ignition .",
    "we present results from model prd5.5 ( e.  bravo & d.  garca - senz , in preparation ) .",
    "the model started from five sparks , incinerating 0.14 @xmath8  during the initial subsonic combustion phase , and later on a detonation processed most of the remaining carbon and oxygen .",
    "finally , the explosion produced @xmath9  ergs of kinetic energy , and ejected 0.86  @xmath8  of @xmath10 , 0.15 @xmath8  of intermediate - mass elements , and 0.18 @xmath8  of carbon and oxygen . in model",
    "prd5.5 the ejected mass of stable iron and nickel was @xmath11 , most of which was moving at velocities in excess of 10,000  @xmath7 .",
    "the final averaged distribution of elements in velocity space is quite similar to that of model prd6 ( see fig .  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "the 3-d composition of model prd5.5 is quite clumpy .",
    "the angle averaged version is rather uniform in the outer layers above @xmath12  @xmath7 , where the supernova spectrum mostly forms before a few days past maximum light ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comps ] ) .",
    "while the outer layers are dominated by @xmath4ni , there is significant silicon , sulfur , and oxygen as required for sn ia spectra .",
    "it is a quantitative question that only a code such as ` phoenix `  can determine whether or not the outer @xmath4ni conflicts with observations .",
    "there is also significant carbon in the outer layers and c+o dominates the innermost region .",
    "synthetic spectrum modeling by @xcite of the deflagration model c3_3d_256_10s @xcite found that abundant c+o matter in the interior was inconsistent with late - time nebular spectra .",
    "model c3_3d_256_10s had more interior c+o than prd5.5 , therefore future nebular modeling of prd5.5 is also important .",

    "we first examine the maximum light spectrum of sn  1994d , which we have used in previous papers to study the detailed spectral behavior since it is nearby and extremely well - observed @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : sn94d_max ] shows the results of our best - fit model ( we use the outer boundary condition of the total bolometric luminosity in the observer s frame to find the best fit ) .",
    "the overall fit is not all that bad , the feature at 6150  attributed to si  ii @xmath13 is reasonably well fit , however the `` w '' feature attributed to s  ii is totally washed out . additionally just to the red of the 6150 feature",
    "is another feature almost certainly due to c  ii @xmath14 .",
    "this feature has in fact been observed in early sne  ia spectra @xcite .",
    "while the 6150  feature is the usual defining feature for sn  ia , the s  ii `` w '' is even a more reliable diagnostic .",
    "sne  ib / c spectra do show features that have been identified as si  ii , but only sne  ia show the s  ii feature .",
    "since silicon and sulfur are made nearly simultaneously one might expect the lines to appear together , however the si  ii line is much stronger than the s  ii lines , thus it requires more sulfur to obtain the s  ii `` w '' feature .",
    "empirically s  ii seems to be the best classifier of sne  ia .",
    "even the extremely odd sn  ia 2002ic which shows strong narrow balmer lines in emission shows solid evidence for the s  ii `` w '' @xcite .",
    "if s  ii is used as the defining feature of sn  ia , then the synthetic spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig : sn94d_max ] is not that of a sn  ia .",
    "since the angle averaging will automatically lead to some washing out of the flux spectrum we should be careful not to draw too strong conclusions about the absence of s  ii lines , but their complete absence in the presence of si  ii is interesting .",
    "while the relative amount of silicon and sulfur in the model is quite similar s  iii is less abundant than si  iii only by a factor of two or more everywhere in the outer atmosphere , thus it is unclear why there is no evidence for s  ii in the synthetic spectra ( the lines of the ionization stage just below the most abundant one tend to be strongest , since there is then energy to excite the levels above the ground state ) .",
    "we speculate that the complete absence of evidence for s  ii in the synthetic spectrum is a peculiarity of the particular nlte state realized in the outer ejecta of prd5.5 .",
    "if so ( and only a very detailed decomposition of the spectrum formation in future work can tell ) , only a ` phoenix `   level calculation could reveal this peculiarity inherent in prd5.5 .",
    "the synthetic spectra of a full nlte model of prd5.5 , 20 days after explosion , is compared to the observed spectrum of sn  1994d on march 21 , 1994 ( the time of b maximum ) .",

    "scaledwidth=70.0% ]    figure  [ fig : sn06d_m07 ] shows the best fit spectrum compared to sn  2006d seven days prior to @xmath16 maximum , where the c  ii @xmath17 line is prominent in the observed spectrum . at this earlier time",
    "the emission portion of the carbon line in the synthetic spectrum is evident but the absorption trough is not blue enough and does not have the right shape .",
    "the triangular shape in the observed spectrum is almost certainly due to line blending .",
    "s  ii is again missing in the synthetic spectrum .",
    "the outermost compositions used in the spectral modelling are somewhat uncertain due to lower resolution in the outer parts of the spectral grid and to the need to interpolate from the gridless hydro models ( the grid needed for good resolution in synthetic spectra is different from that needed in hydro ) .",
    "this effect , coupled with the smearing created by the angle averaging procedure would lead us not to expect perfect agreement with the observed lineshapes .",
    "the synthetic spectra of a full nlte model of prd5.5 , 13 days after explosion , is compared to the observed spectrum of sn  2006d on 7 days prior to b maximum .",

    "no reddening correction was made .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]    one of the key features of the pulsating - reverse - detonation model is that it creates a composition inversion .",
    "that is , the initial deflagration burns at high density and thus tends to make iron - peak elements on the outside at high velocity .",
    "high velocity features have been detected in supernova spectra at early times , but they tend to be either unburnt material such as carbon , or intermediate mass elements like calcium . @xcite",
    "used high velocity fe  ii to fit near maximum light supernova spectra , using the simple parameterized code synow .",
    "however , the optical depths used were low , and thus the material could be primordial .",
    "it is impossible to use synow to directly determine abundances .",
    "figure  [ fig : sn92a_d25 ] shows the combined _ hst _ and optical spectrum of sn  1992a five days past maximum light @xcite .",
    "plotted on this figure are five different choices for the outer boundary condition , the total luminosity in the observer s frame .",
    "the luminosity varies from the lowest value to the highest by a factor of 13 .",
    "the logarithmic bolometric luminosity ( ergs  s@xmath19 ) is : l1=-17.02 , l2=-18.58 , l3=-19.07 , l4=-19.31 , l5=-19.81 . clearly",
    "no value chosen for the luminosity can reproduce the observed colors across the uv+optical spectrum .",
    "this is almost certainly due to the large amount of iron - peak elements in the outer parts of the model .",
    "these elements have such strong line blanketing that they always push much of the flux to the red and thus the red colors are too red for all reasonable luminosities .     the synthetic spectra of a full nlte model of prd5.5 , 25 days after explosion , are compared to the observed spectrum of sn  1992a observed five days past b maximum .",
    "the indicated lines show synthetic spectra of models with increasing total bolometric luminosity in the observer s frame ( l1-l5 ) .",
    "the observed spectrum has been corrected for redshift assuming a velocity of 1845  @xmath7 .",
    "no reddening correction was made .",
    "while the optical spectra can be somewhat fit , no variation in the luminosity can fit the entire wavelength range from the uv to the optical .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "the pulsating - reverse - detonation model is a novel mechanism that combines the advantages of the delayed detonation mechanism ( higher explosion energy , low amounts of unburnt fuel remaining ) without requiring a deflagration to detonation transition in an unconfined medium .",
    "however , the mechanism still has to be explored further and different variations will change the total mass in the initial deflagration .",
    "we have examined just one particular realization here and we have also studied only the angle averaged flux spectra calculated in spherical symmetry , thus losing some of the important 3-d effects of the model .",
    "we note that we have also studied the spectra of prd6.0 .",
    "prd6.0 burned carbon more efficiently during the deflagration phase , thus the mass fraction of stable iron and nickel in the outer layers of that model is nearly one order of magnitude lower than in prd5.5 .",
    "however , the mass fraction of @xmath10  in the outermost layer is only slightly lower ( @xmath20% ) in prd6.0 .",
    "the overall differences in the synthetic spectra were not significant .",
    "this suggests that the composition inversion inherent in the model will lead to supernova spectra and light curves that are extremely red , which has not been observed",
    ". a way out of this would be if there were some pre - expansion during the initial deflagration phase so that the burning is to intermediate mass elements rather than all the way to the iron - peak .",
    "the pre - expansion is dependent on details of the initial model .",
    "for instance , if a shallow enough thermal gradient were present in the bubbles , the nuclear burning would propagate initially with a shockless supersonic phase velocity that would lead to pre - expansion before the combustion settled in a subsonic flame regime .",
    "another possibility is that the explosion takes place in the core of a rotating white dwarf . since for the same central density ,",
    "fast rotators are more prone to synthesize more intermediate - mass elements and less iron than static initial models .",
    "the determination of the ignition configuration of the white dwarf is one of the key problems in the physics of snia during the explosion phase .",
    "thus , we reiterate that the problem found in the models studied here do not rule out the prd scenario , just the particular realizations that we have studied .",
    "clearly there is more work to be done in studying this particular explosion mechanism .",
    "our work also shows the power of quantitative spectroscopy in validating hydrodynamical explosion models .",
