    "in recent years a variety of kinetic exchange models have been investigated within the emerging discipline of econophysics ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "these models involve a population of agents , each possessing a certain amount of wealth , undergoing random pairwise exchanges of wealth according to certain predefined rules .",
    "one is mainly interested in the evolution of the wealth distribution as the process unfolds , and in particular in its convergence to a limiting distribution and in the characteristics of this equilibrium distribution .    in this work",
    "we study the directed random market process , recently introduced by martnez - martnez and lpez - ruiz @xcite . in this model ,",
    "when two agents interact , one of them is randomly chosen and transfers a fraction @xmath1 of its wealth to the other agent , where @xmath2 $ ] is a uniformly distributed random number .",
    "thus if agents @xmath3 with wealths @xmath4 , interact , and if @xmath5 is the ` winner ' , then the agents wealth following the interaction is given by @xmath6    this process should be contrasted with the well - known drgulescu - yakovenko process @xcite , in which the two agents wealths are pooled and then randomly re - divided , so that @xmath7 thus in directed random market , exchanges are always uni - directional rather than bi - directional as in the drgulescu - yakovenko model",
    ". as we shall see below , this leads to a significant difference in the eventual distribution of wealth at the macro - level .",
    "it should be noted that kinetic exchange models with uni - directional exchanges are already present in the pioneering work of j. angle @xcite , but in angle s inequality process the fraction @xmath1 is either fixed for all agents , or a fixed number associated to each agent , rather than a random number independently drawn in each exchange , as in the directed random market .",
    "martnez - martnez and lpez - ruiz @xcite derived the functional iterations for the discrete - time evolution of the probability density describing the wealth distribution @xmath8 , in the limit of infinitely many agents , so that @xmath9 is the fraction of the population whose wealth is in the interval @xmath10 $ ] at time @xmath11 .",
    "it is assumed that in each time step all agents are randomly paired , and interact according to ( [ inter ] ) .",
    "the functional iterations are given ( in slightly different notation than used in @xcite ) by @xmath12(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath13(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^x p_t(x - u ) \\int_{u}^\\infty   \\frac{1}{v } p_t(v ) dv   du+\\frac{1}{2 } \\int_x^\\infty \\frac{1}{u } p_t(u)du.\\ ] ] based on numerical evaluation of these iterations , martnez - martnez and lpez - ruiz @xcite noted that the wealth distribution ` piles up ' at low values of wealth .",
    "here we will find an explicit expression for the equilibrium distribution , that is the solutions of @xmath14 of the fixed - point problem @xmath15=p_w^*,\\ ] ] parameterized by the mean wealth @xmath16 , which is a conserved quantity of the iterations ( [ recursion ] ) .",
    "[ tip ] the equilibrium distributions for the directed random market process are given by the probability density ( @xmath17 ) : @xmath18    note that the density ( [ exd ] ) corresponds to the gamma distribution with shape parameter @xmath0 and mean @xmath16 .",
    "this can be compared with the equilibrium distribution for the drgulescu - yakovenko process , which is an exponential ( boltzmann - gibbs ) distribution : @xmath19 the equilibrium density ( [ exd ] ) , in contrast with ( [ drage ] ) , goess to infinity as @xmath20 goes to zero , which accounts for the ` piling up ' at low values of wealth noted in @xcite ( see figure [ exa3 ] for plots of the two densities ) . we note also that the coefficient of variation ( standard deviation divided by mean ) of ( [ drage ] ) is @xmath21 , while that of ( [ exd ] ) is @xmath22 , which shows that the directed random market leads to a higher degree of inequality .",
