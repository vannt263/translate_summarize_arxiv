    "the current in each winding is constrained to be the same , and we preserve this feature in our related geometry .",

    "both authors noted that in the limit @xmath23 the solutions approach those for a uniform infinite slab of width @xmath3 carrying an average current density @xmath24 .",
    "in other words , the stack becomes equivalent to a homogenous superconducting slab with critical current density @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the critical current in each tape .",
    "we expect that in practical applications the ratio @xmath18 will lie in the range 0.01 - 0.2 . in figure 2",

    "it is likely that the error in this approach will be similar to that of the infinite stack ; see figure 2 .",
    "the current density @xmath27 and magnetic induction @xmath28 are averaged over a volume @xmath29 ; that is , we use only macroscopic values of these quantities . to model the constraint of constant total current in each tape , we require that @xmath30 for all @xmath31 . in section 2",

    "further , we can not assume that @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the region @xmath35 , as is the case for the homogeneous infinite slab .",
    "it is known from studies of the critical state model in an isolated superconducting strip @xcite that no significant amount of magnetic flux can penetrate subcritical portions of the strip ( i.e. , @xmath14 wherever @xmath36 ) ; this is also true for each of the strips in the @xmath19 stack . on the other hand ,",
    "a finite @xmath37 is allowed , since magnetic flux can thread between the superconducting layers from the ends of the tapes without fully penetrating any superconductor .",
    "this leads to important constraints on @xmath28 and @xmath38 in the middle region @xmath35 : since @xmath39 , we must have @xmath40 , such that @xmath37 depends only on @xmath8 .",

    "the result is @xcite @xmath72 the physical interpretation of this formula is that @xmath61 is the summation of the energy dissipated by vortices as they move a distance @xmath73 from the edge to their final positions ; the force per unit length is @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the superconducting flux quantum , and the density of vortices is @xmath76 .",
    "the current and field distributions during the initial penetration of magnetic flux are not the same as those that occur during one quarter of the ac cycle .",
