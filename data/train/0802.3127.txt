    "an abundance of astrophysical evidence points to the conclusion that the bulk of the matter in the universe is composed _ not _ of standard model ( sm ) particles , but of some unknown non - relativistic elementary particle known as cold dark matter ( cdm)@xcite . an analysis of the three - year wmap and galaxy survey data sets@xcite implies that the ratio of cold dark matter density to critical density , _ cdmh^2_cdm/_c = 0.111^+0.011_-0.015  ( 2 ) .",
    "[ eq : oh2 ] where @xmath9 is the scaled hubble constant .",
    "while the density of cdm is becoming precisely known , the identity of the cdm particle ( or particles ) is still a complete mystery .",
    "although numerous candidate cdm particles populate the theoretical literature , the wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) stand out in that their thermal abundance can be calculated , and is found to be in rough accord with eq .",
    "( [ eq : oh2 ] ) provided the wimp mass is of order 100 - 1000 gev .",
    "of the numerous wimp candidates in the literature , the lightest neutralino of supersymmetric ( susy ) theories is especially popular because susy solves a host of theoretical problems associated with the sm , and also receives some ( albeit indirect ) support from data ( in the form of the measured gauge couplings unifying at @xmath10 under mssm rg evolution and also from other precision electroweak measurements@xcite ) .",
    "there is at present a multi - pronged effort aimed at identifying wimp dark matter particles and measuring their properties@xcite .",
    "the most direct approach is to try to detect relic wimps left over from the big bang by observing wimp - nucleon collisions in experiments located deep underground .",
    "limits from the cdms@xcite experiment and more recently from the xenon-10@xcite experiment have begun probing the upper limits of susy model parameter space .",
    "wimp particles can also be searched for at collider experiments such as those at the cern lhc , especially if the dark matter particle is but one of a whole family of particles , some of which can be produced via strong and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "the dark matter particle would then be produced by cascade decays of heavier particles , and would lead to missing transverse energy in collider events .",
    "such is the case of theories such as @xmath11-parity conserving supersymmetry@xcite , @xmath12-parity conserving universal extra dimensions ( ued)@xcite and little higgs models with @xmath13-parity@xcite .",
    "dark matter may also be searched for indirectly .",
    "for instance , the sun can sweep up wimp particles as it traverses its galactic orbit , so that wimps accumulate at a high density in the solar core",
    ". then wimp - wimp annihilation to sm particles can occur at high rates in the solar core .",
    "while most sm particles would be absorbed by the surrounding solar medium , multi - gev scale @xmath14s would escape and later convert to muons in neutrino telescopes such as amanda / icecube or antares .",
    "in addition , dark matter in the galactic halo can be searched for indirectly via its annihilation into high energy gamma rays or anti - matter . in the case of gamma rays ,",
    "searches look either for wimp - wimp annihilation directly to @xmath15 pairs ( loop - suppressed since wimps are electrically neutral ) or via wimp - wimp annihilation to @xmath16 pairs , followed by @xmath17 via hadronization and decay . in the latter case ,",
    "one expects a diffuse spectrum of gamma rays with energies @xmath18 atop a background arising from cosmic ray spallation onto nuclei , inverse compton scattering and bremsstrahlung .",
    "the spectral shape of the gamma ray sky has been measured in the 1990s by the egret experiment in the energy range of 0.1 - 10 gev@xcite , where already an excess of signal with @xmath19 gev above expected background was noted .",
    "the @xmath19 gev excess apparently is seen in all sky directions .",

    "@xcite , strong , moskalenko and reimer verify that a `` conventional model '' of cosmic ray production and propagation is insufficient to explain the egret gev anomaly , even if augmented by hard sources of additional cosmic ray production in the inner galaxy .",
    "however , by suitably adjusting the spectrum of cosmic protons and electrons , they find they _ are _ able to by - and - large match the egret data .    alternatively ,",
    "et al._@xcite claim the egret excess can be explained by a calibration error in egret gamma measurements with @xmath19 gev .",
    "this would explain why an excess of high energy gammas comes from all sky regions .",
    "et al._@xcite point out that if they use the deboer derived distribution of galactic dark matter , including the ring structure , then the susy region favored in the deboer analysis yields an anti - proton flux far in excess of measurements from the bess experiment .",
    "these calculations adopt the isotropic darksusy model of cosmic ray propagation .",
    "counter that using an _ anisotropic _ model of galactic cosmic ray propagation would greatly reduce the expected @xmath45 flux@xcite .    in this note , we wish to examine the susy interpretation of the egret excess , and compare it with other constraints on sparticle masses .",
    "we find that the susy interpretation in terms of the msugra model is in conflict with recent results on direct detection of dark matter from the xenon-10 experiment . by moving to models with non - universality in the higgs sector ,",
    "however , one may preserve the susy interpretation of the egret gamma ray excess , while staying below bounds on direct detection of dm . in any case , the imminent turn - on of the lhc should decide the issue .",
    "the deboer interpretation predicts gluinos with mass @xmath2 gev .",
    "production cross sections for gluino pair production in this mass range at the lhc are at the @xmath46 fb level .",
    "thus , lhc should decisively test the deboer scenario with as little as 0.1 fb@xmath3 of integrated luminosity .",
    "if the msugra interpretation is correct , then the heavy higgs boson @xmath37 should have mass around @xmath47 gev .",
    "if an interpretation in terms of the nuhm model is correct , then @xmath34 should be much lower- in the @xmath48 gev range .",
    "we begin by calculating sparticle mass spectra using the isajet 7.76@xcite isasugra code .",
    "isajet begins with weak scale @xmath49 values for the three gauge couplings and yukawa couplings , and evolves up in energy to determine @xmath24 , defined as the @xmath50 value where gauge couplings @xmath51 . at @xmath24 , soft susy breaking boundary conditions",

    "all tree level sparticle masses are computed .",
    "once these are known , then all 1-loop sparticle masses are computed , including susy threshold corrections to @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the threshold effects alter the trajectories of the running couplings , so that an up - down iterative approach is used to calculate all 1-loop corrected sparticle masses ; the iterations terminate when a convergence criterion is satisfied . at this point , all sparticle decay branching fractions are calculated , along with neutralino relic density @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath29 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , via the isatools package@xcite .",
    "the latter quantity , the neutralino annihilation cross section times relative velocity , in the limit as @xmath66 , is the crucial particle physics quantity needed to evaluate various halo annihilation processes .    regarding the neutralino direct dark matter detection cross section , we note here that a new limit on the spin - independent neutralino - nucleon scattering cross section , @xmath63 , has appeared from the xenon-10 collaboration@xcite .",

    "the beauty of this approach is that when neutralino annihilation in the early universe via @xmath38-channel @xmath37 exchange is large , so also is halo annihilation of neutralinos@xcite .",

    "[ fig : eg1]_a_. we see that as @xmath32 increases , the value of @xmath63 also increases .",
    "this is due to higgs exchange direct detection scattering diagrams , and the increasing magnitude of the @xmath1-quark yukawa coupling . the important point to notice",
    ", however , is that the value of @xmath63 has increased into the xenon-10 excluded region at a @xmath32 value somewhat lower than that needed for the relic density to enter the wmap - allowed dark matter band .",

    "we do so by scanning over the entire msugra model parameter space : @xmath95 our results of this scan are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sug ] . here , we keep only points with @xmath96 , and also @xmath97 gev .",

    "of course , one way out is to assume we live in a local void of dark matter , and the local density is far below the assumed value of 0.3 gev/@xmath70 .",

    "our goal will be to lower @xmath32 , so that we will diminish the direct detection cross section to levels below the xenon-10 limit .",
    "meanwhile , we wish to maintain a large @xmath65 so that we maintain a high rate of neutralino halo annihilations .",
    "this can be done by lowering @xmath34 so that we move nearer ( but not directly on ) @xmath37-resonance annihilation .    here , we scan over the nuhm2 parameter space : @xmath110 while again plotting points which satisfy the wmap relic density bound and have @xmath97 gev .",
