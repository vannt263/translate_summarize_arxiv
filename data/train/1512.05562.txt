    "periodically driven quantum dynamics has recently attracted much attention both in experiment and theory@xcite , as it possesses novel properties such as topological phases@xcite and quantum phase transitions@xcite that otherwise would be impossible to achieve in the undriven case .",
    "therefore , the application of ac fields has become a very promising tool to engineer quantum systems .",
    "it is difficult to handle a quantum system driven periodically by a field with respect to its undriven counterpart , fortunately , floquet theorem provides us with a method to deal with such a system .",
    "it tells that for a closed system governed by a periodic hamiltonian , its evolution operator can be decomposed into two parts , one can given by a time - independent effective hamiltonian ( called floquet hamiltonian ) and another is periodic in time describing the periodic micromotion of the driven system(called micromotion operator ) .",
    "hence , we can design a suitable time - periodic driving to change the properties of the floquet hamiltonian as well as the micromotion operator .",
    "this method has been used in many experiments with ultracold atoms in driven optical lattices , for example , the dynamic localization @xcite , the control of the bosonic superfluid - to - mott - insulator transition @xcite , resonant coupling of bloch bands @xcite , the dynamic creation of kinetic frustration @xcite , the realization of artificial magnetic fields and topological band structures @xcite as well as the manipulation of spin - orbit coupling for cold atoms@xcite .    for closed systems ,",
    "periodically driven quantum dynamics is governed by a time - periodic hamiltonian @xmath5 leading to an unitary time - evolution operator @xmath6 . because @xmath5 , it is convenient to define a time - independent hamiltonian @xmath2 satisfying @xmath7 . by the use of @xmath2 ,",
    "we can rewrite @xmath8 . defining @xmath9",
    ", we can easily check that @xmath1 , where @xmath10 is an operator describing micromotion as mentioned above .",
    "@xmath2 is the effect floquet hamiltonian .",
    "having @xmath2 , we can use its eigenstate as a basis @xmath11 . for any initial state",
    ", we can expand it with these bases as @xmath12 , then the state at time @xmath13 takes , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 called floquet modes . in the large frequency limit , we can consider stroboscopic time evolution only , and the problem is then simplified to calculate @xmath2 .",
    "for some special cases , we can get an explicit expression for @xmath2 , but in general we can only get an approximating result for @xmath2@xcite .    in most realistic situations , a quantum system should be considered as an open quantum system coupled to an environment that induces decoherence and dissipation .",
    "such systems are of interest for studies due to its connection to quantum computation , precision measurements and theories of quantum measurement .",
    "however , a general theory for open quantum systems similar to the floquet theorem for closed systems remains unexplored .    in this work",
    ", we present a floquet theorem for open systems .",
    "we find that the linear map which transforms the system from initial states to final states can be decomposed into two parts .",
    "the first part stems from the periodic time dependence of the driven system and is called micromotion , while the second contribution , which leads to deviations from the periodic evolution , originates from a time - independent lindbladian . using the floquet theorem of open system , we calculated the dynamics of a dissipative two - level system with periodic hamiltonian or lindblad operators .",
    "we define a fidelity to quantify the deviation of the exact dynamics to that by the floquet theorem , and find numerically the dependence of the fidelity on the driven frequency and decay rate etc ..",
    "we start with a time dependent master equation with time - dependent lindbladian @xmath16 , @xmath17 as @xmath16 is a linear operator , we can define a linear map @xmath18 by , @xmath19 so the solution of the eq.([master equation ] ) is formally given by , @xmath20 where the propagator @xmath21 takes , @xmath22 , and by the divisibility condition , we have @xmath23 if @xmath16 periodically depends on time and the dynamics is markovian , @xmath24 and @xmath25 in @xmath21 are not independent , i.e. , the propagator depends only on @xmath26 . noting that at each time instance , there is a infinitesimal propagator , @xmath27 and @xmath28",
