    "we may get the stark effect by , instead , applying two dc voltages perpendicular to the cavity axis ( and perpendicular to each other ) .",
    "thus the atomic orbital plane may be maintained perpendicular to the @xmath6 or @xmath7 polarizations , and the atom may be coupled to just one mode at a time .",
    "such voltages may be produced directly in the ring around  the cavity ( in this case the ring must not be continuous ) or , if we take away the ring , in plates outside the cavity .",
    "\\2 ) the modes may be constructed in two separate cavities .",
    "since we are investigating effects of the interaction between the cavities modes through the environment , it would be suitable to have the cavities as close as possible to each other .",
    "in fact , if the distance between the cavities is small in the modes wavelength scale , this interaction is expected to be maximized .",
    "adjusting the curve @xmath91 could teach us something about the values of @xmath115 and @xmath47 , or at least about a tendency to form a dfs , if one approaches the ideal limit described above .    from the theoretical point of view",
