    "in the standard formulation of general relativity ( gr ) , it is axiomatic that frames are non - dynamical objects determined by the choice of observers .",
    "this feature of gr is a consequence of the clock hypothesis axiom , which postulates that the rate at which an ideal clock ( one that is corrected for the mechanical effects of acceleration ) operates depends only on its 4-velocity .",
    "however , the role that frames play in dynamical structure of gr is more complicated than suggested by their place in the axiomatic framework .",
    "this is because matter , as it is modeled in the theory , often distinguishes a frame which becomes a dynamical object .",
    "examples of such frames are the 4-velocity streamlines in fluid models and stationary observers in static space - times .",
    "the dependence of the space - time metric on the distinguished frame of the matter flow suggests an extension of gr in which the frame dependence of the metric is incorporated into the axiomatic structure of the theory .    to see the possibility of such an extension",
    ", a frame of observers must be viewed as a geometric object in its own right .",
    "this is best accomplished if a frame , rather than being viewed as a choice of coordinates on space - time , is represented in an abreviated form , as a closed 1-form field @xmath0 on space - time @xmath1 .",
    "the data that @xmath0 carries concerning the associated field of observers is the nature of the observers clocks , and the local decomposition of @xmath1 into space - like submanifolds . now a 1-form field can also be viewed as a section of the cotangent bundle @xmath2 of @xmath1 . from this perspective",
    "the geometric object most easily associated with a frame is its image @xmath3 .",
    "to arrive at the proposed extension of gr , the frame of observers @xmath3 is thought of as an analogue of an observer s world - line in galilean or special relativity .",
    "the fundamental problem in special or galilean relativity is to fix a representation of time along a world - line .",
    "a similar question arises in extending gr which is to establish method for defining a space - time metric on @xmath3 .",
    "the galilean approach advocates an extrinsic procedure in which there is a fixed correspondence that takes @xmath3 to a model space where distances are measured . in galilean relativity",
    "the fixed extrinsic structure is the universal time line @xmath4 . in the present case , @xmath1 and the bundle map @xmath5 serves this purpose . on the other hand",
    ", relativistic approach postulates that distance measurement is intrinsic to the submanifold @xmath3 itself , and may depend on the position of the submanifold in the ambient space .",
    "the galilean approach can be seen to yield the standard structure of gr .",
    "it is encoded in the axiom which for emphasis einstein states as _ continuum spatii et temporis est absolutum _ @xcite . in this article",
    "we shall investigate whether the relativistic approach may be the more powerful .",
    "following einstein s dictum , if the relativistic approach is to be a viable alternative , it must be demonstrated to be consistent , in the appropriate limit reduce to prior tested theories , and have interesting consequences .",
    "consistency is of course a very difficult question in physics .",
    "the second criteria of reduction to existing theoretical structure at least suggests a level of consistency similar to existing theories .",
    "in following we hope to demonstrate that an extension of gr using the relativistic approach to measuring space - time distances satisfies the last two of these criteria .    to show that the relativistic approach does in fact have interesting consequences",
    ", we shall examine the implications of the extended theory for homogeneous cosmological models . here , because in the extended theory the metric is frame dependent , it is most natural to apply the equivalence principle in the matter frame .",
    "this leads to a third rather than second order equation for the cosmic scale factor ; the solutions of which appear to have interesting global consequences .",
    "it will be shown that if the universe is assumed to evolve towards a dust state , then it must have originated from an inflationary state .",
    "in fact the model suggests that the alternation of standard and inflationary phases may be a cyclic process .",
    "analysis of the model shows that it has the same consequences as current homogeneous inflation models but with the advantage that cosmic evolution from the inflationary phase to the present can be described as a single process .",
    "the mathematical structure presented here does not yet apply to the study of fluctuation in initial cosmic matter density , and so it can not be expected to account adequately for phenomena such as reheating and condensation .",
    "in this discussion a frame on a space - time @xmath1 will be represented by the pair @xmath6 , where @xmath0 is 1-form field on @xmath1 , and @xmath7 is vector field on @xmath1 .",
    "a frame provides a decomposition of the tangent space to @xmath8 at @xmath9 that is given by @xmath10 .",
    "this decomposition is interpreted as the infinitesimal decomposition of @xmath11 into space and time directions by the observer associated with the frame and located at @xmath9 .",
    "note that this decomposition is independent of the choice of scale for the vectors @xmath7 and @xmath0 .",
    "the scale of @xmath7 and @xmath0 has useful descriptive properties .",
    "the scale @xmath7 is associated with the observer s choice of time coordinates and the scale of @xmath0 can be interpreted as a mass scale for particles .",
    "although the association of 1-forms with mass is a standard correspondence in gr that is usually established from momentum consideration , we provide here an argument for this relation based on newton s second law .",
    "suppose that @xmath12 is another vector field on @xmath1 , then the invariant velocity @xmath13 of @xmath12 in the frame @xmath6 is given by @xmath14 .",
    "note that @xmath13 is invariant quantity in that it is independent of the choice of scale of @xmath12 , and hence is a geometric objects associated with the flow lines of @xmath12 .",
    "the velocity @xmath13 , however , is dependent on the choice of scale of @xmath0 .",
    "newton s law in the given frame may be expressed as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the force and @xmath17 is the invariant derivative of @xmath13 .",
    "the invariant derivative is given in terms of the levi - civita connection @xmath18 by the expression    @xmath19    here @xmath20 is the projection onto the complement of @xmath7 .",
    "now suppose that the frame @xmath6 is replaced by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a positive constant .",
    "let @xmath23 be the invariant velocity of @xmath12 in the frame @xmath21 .",
    "the above definitions imply that @xmath24 or @xmath25 . hence in the frame @xmath21",
    "the mass of @xmath12 is @xmath26 .",
    "hence @xmath0 can be imputed to have the same dimension as @xmath27    the equivalence principle guarantees that relativistic dynamics can be reduced to newtonian dynamics infinitesimally along any flow line of @xmath7 .",
    "however , it is only under very strong conditions that this correspondence can be extended locally . in the case where @xmath28 , @xmath29 being the 1-form metrically dual to @xmath7 , the newtonian constructions gives an equivalent description of metric geometry only",
    "when @xmath7 is a gradient killing field @xcite .",
    "this assumption implies that @xmath7 is holonomically trivial or @xmath30 .",
    "unfortunately , a self gravitating frame of massive observers can not be holonomically trivial , and this fact leads to a global incompleteness in the description of the physics of such systems .",
    "mathematically , this difficulty surfaces in the lack of a globally holonomic frame in which to apply the equivalence principle . this mathematical fact is mirrored in physical principle that gravity destroys states of local thermodynamic equilibrium by invoking the other fundamental forces and thus altering the local equation of state .",
    "this is particularly true in cosmology where the evolution of fluid streamlines can only be determined by fitting equations of state appropriate to each of the local temperature regime found in the evolving universe .",
    "the fact that there is no universal law that describes cosmic evolution thus can be traced to the fact that we lack a universal description of the forces in nature . however , the fact that such a simple model as the perfect fluid model appears to describe the bulk of cosmological space - time , suggests there should exist an underlying principle from which a globally significant cosmological model can be derived .    here",
    "we shall investigate the possibility that such a principle may be derived from a generalization of the equivalence principle that arises in an extension of gr in which the space - time metric is frame dependent .",
    "this extension of gr is obtained by a procedure that is analogous to the procedure used to obtain special relativity ( sr ) from galilean relativity ( glr ) .",
    "recall that the galilean theory of time can be formulated by supposing that the space - time manifold @xmath1 possesses a fibration @xmath31 .",
    "this fibration is assumed to possess a connection represented by a vector field @xmath7 on @xmath1 which must necessarily have the property that if @xmath32 is the flow of @xmath7 then @xmath33 .",
    "thus the pair @xmath34 determines a synchronous field of observers on @xmath1 with the special property @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath36 be a model for the fiber of @xmath37 .",
    "glr supposes that @xmath36 and @xmath4 are separately endowed with the complete riemannian metric tensors @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and that @xmath39 is solely responsible for determining the time between two events @xmath40 .",
    "if @xmath41 is the topological metric on @xmath4 determined by @xmath39 , then according to glr , the time between @xmath9 and @xmath38 is given by @xmath42 . in sr time does not have this well defined character but depends on the observer with respect to which these events are referenced .",
    "the metric that an observer uses is induced on the observer world line from a metric @xmath43 on @xmath1 that is obtained by summing @xmath39 and @xmath38 .",
    "this is done using the decomposition @xmath44 , the natural isomorphisms @xmath45 , and the identification @xmath46 .",
    "the metric @xmath43 is then given by the expression @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a universal constant . in the limit as @xmath49",
    ", sr reduces to glr .",
    "this procedure can be carried out again with the base manifold @xmath4 replaced by the space - time manifold @xmath1 , and the fibration @xmath31 replaced by a fibration @xmath50 .",
    "the manifold @xmath51 that replaces @xmath1 can be discovered by noting that in sr the fiber @xmath52 parameterizes the positions of all possible observers at time @xmath53 .",
    "thus , by analogy it is natural to suppose that for an event @xmath54 the fiber @xmath55 parameterizes the frames of all possible observers at @xmath9 .",
    "the above description of frames indicates that the fiber should be @xmath56 .",
    "however , it will be assumed that there is a relation @xmath57 , and that the frames under consideration all have the form @xmath58 , and thus the fiber of @xmath59 at @xmath9 may be assumed to be @xmath60 , making @xmath61 .",
    "as in sr , a metric can be constructed on @xmath2 using the lorentzian metric on @xmath1 and the induced metric on the fibers of @xmath2 .",
    "to interpret this construction it is helpful to recall how relativity unifies space and time dimensions . in the case of sr ,",
    "tangent vectors to @xmath36 are assigned the dimension of length @xmath62 while tangent vectors to @xmath4 are assigned the dimension of time @xmath63 .",
    "metric tensors are supposed to be dimensionless .",
    "if the universal constant @xmath48 is supposed to have the dimension @xmath64 , then for vector fields @xmath7 and @xmath12 on @xmath1 , @xmath65 has dimension @xmath66 .",
    "this suggests that the dimensional structure of @xmath1 should be simplified by measuring the length of tangent vectors to @xmath36 in @xmath63-units with 1 @xmath62-unit equaling @xmath67 @xmath63-units .",
    "in such a system @xmath68 and all physical tangent vectors to @xmath1 have dimension @xmath63 .    in the case of @xmath2 ,",
    "the above discussion of newton s law suggests that the fibers of @xmath2 should be given the dimension mass @xmath69 .",
    "thus in this case we see that there is the need of a physical constant @xmath70 of dimension @xmath71 relating the base and fiber dimensions .",
    "the constant @xmath72 is easily seen to have the same dimension as the gravitational constant .    to construct a metric on @xmath2",
    "denote the space - time metric by @xmath39 and proceed analogously to construct a metric @xmath43 on @xmath2 . in analogy with glr",
    ", the horizontal distribution @xmath73 of the levi - civita connection plays the role of the field @xmath7 .",
    "it is a well known fact in connection theory that @xmath74 decomposes as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the vertical distribution of the fibration @xmath5 . because @xmath2 is a vector bundle",
    "there is a natural isomorphism @xmath77 defined for each @xmath78 .",
    "the isomorphism @xmath79 together with the isomorphism @xmath80 can be used to define a class of metrics on @xmath74 with the property that @xmath73 and @xmath76 are orthogonal distributions .",
    "of particular interest is the metric @xmath43 given by @xmath81    this expression is considerably more complicated than the corresponding expression in sr due to the presence of the metric dependent conformal factors .",
    "there are several reasons why this particular form was chosen for @xmath43 .",
    "first , the parallelism of this metric can be shown to be closely related to fermi parallelism along curves on the space - time @xcite .",
    "thus , the relativistic effects of acceleration are encoded in the geometric structure defined by @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "second , since @xmath82 should have a well defined dimension , the dimensions of the vertical and horizontal summand of this quantity should be equal .",
    "this implies that @xmath83 has dimension of the gravitational constant @xmath84 , and so @xmath85 has the dimension of plank s constant @xmath86 .",
    "thus the dimension of the conformal factors can be factored as @xmath87 .",
    "this factorization is similar to the factorization of the gravitational constant @xmath88 where @xmath89 is planck s mass .",
    "this particular way of expressing the dimensional dependence of @xmath43 will prove very useful in cosmological applications .",
    "to interpret the metric @xmath43 , consider a field of observers associated with a section @xmath0 of @xmath2 .",
    "just as in sr where the world - line of an observer inherits a metric that measures time displacement , in this case the image of space - time @xmath3 inherits a metric @xmath90 which measures the space - time displacement in that frame . here a dimensional constant @xmath72 is introduced with dimension @xmath91 so that when evaluated @xmath92 has dimension @xmath66",
    ". thus in extended general relativity ( egr ) , an observer field @xmath0 detects not the space - time metric @xmath93 but rather the space - time metric @xmath94 .",
    "it will be demonstrated in section 3 that if @xmath95 and @xmath96 in such a way that @xmath97 , then egr reduces to gr .",
    "this section shall examine some consequences of egr in the standard cosmological model . in this case ,",
    "space - time @xmath1 is modeled by the product @xmath98 where @xmath36 is now a simply connected 3-dimensional space - form of constant sectional curvature @xmath99 .",
    "if @xmath38 is the constant curvature metric on @xmath36 and if @xmath37 is the natural affine coordinate on @xmath4 , then consider the class of friedmann metric tensors @xmath100 where @xmath101 is assumed to be a smooth positive function .",
    "freidmann geometries possess a distinguished frame determined by the unit vector field @xmath102 in the distribution @xmath103 .",
    "this frame is described by the pair @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath27 is some intrinsic mass . to study the geometry of the frame @xmath104",
    "first observe that @xmath106 is of robinson - walker type . to determine the form of @xmath43 on @xmath107 use the induced map @xmath108 to parameterize @xmath109 .",
    "it follows from the theory of linear connections that for any tangent vector @xmath110 , @xmath111 where @xmath18 is the dual levi - civita connection of @xmath39 and @xmath112 denotes the horizontal lift to @xmath74 determined by @xmath18 . from the identities @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a vector field in the distribution @xmath115 , and the above expressions for @xmath116 and @xmath43 , it is easy to see that @xmath117",
    "these expressions imply that since @xmath118 is a diffeomorphism @xmath119    since the intrinsic geometry of the frame determined by @xmath53 is a friedmann geometry , it provides a model of a self gravitating perfect fluid . to complete the model one needs in addition to einstein s equations an equation of state for the fluid . at this point",
    "it is customary in gr to appeal to the equivalence principle and to sr for an equation of state . in egr , since the metric is frame dependent , there is the question of choosing the frame in which to apply the equivalence principle .",
    "the hypothesis that shall be advanced is that the equivalence principle should be applied in the frame of the matter flow , and that in this frame it yields an equation of state with global validity . in other words ,",
    "the entropy generating effects of gravity can be eliminated by `` viewing '' space - time from the matter frame .",
    "this idea can be thought of as an extension of einstein s original version of the equivalence principle in which gravitational forces were eliminated by accelerated frames .",
    "the original form of the equivalence principle was too strong as it only applies infinitesimally or to pseudo - gravitational forces as note above .",
    "however , because the metric in egr is frame dependent the original form of the equivalence is no longer limited to flat geometries and appears to have interesting implications .    to derive the consequences of this assumption recall that for a simple gas , kinematic analysis implies that the energy @xmath120 , pressure @xmath9 and density @xmath121 satisfy the equations of state @xmath122 and that the energy momentum tensor has the form @xmath123 . when coupled with einstein s equations , the equation of state yields a system of equations that determine @xmath101 . for simplicity let @xmath124 . from einstein",
    "s equations in the frame determined by @xmath53 , we have @xmath125 further the matter conservation law implies that there is a constant @xmath39 such that @xmath126 .    to obtain the equations for @xmath101 implied by these relations and the equation of state ,",
    "first assume that , as suggested in the last section , @xmath127 .",
    "it will also be useful to transform to the universal time scale by setting @xmath128 where @xmath129 . with these assumptions",
    "a calculation shows that @xmath130 satisfies @xmath131 it is physically reasonable to assume that the constants @xmath132 and @xmath133 are both extremely small , and so the last two terms in the above expression can be neglected .",
    "if these terms are dropped then the above equation for @xmath134 can be rewritten as a planar system in the variables @xmath135 and @xmath136 which after rescaling time has the form @xmath137 and @xmath138 where @xmath139    this system , although it can not be explicitly solved , can be analyzed using the qualitative theory of planar systems . to interpret this analysis",
    "it should be kept in mind that the @xmath140-phase plane is related through einstein s equations to the hubble constant - pressure plane of the cosmological model .",
    "first note that the above system possesses four stationary points @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 . the stationary point @xmath144 is easily seen to be of hyperbolic type .",
    "however the analysis of this equation is complicated by the fact that @xmath141 is semi - degenerate and @xmath142 and @xmath145 are totally degenerate . the stationary point ( 0,0 )",
    "will be shown to be topologically of hyperbolic type and the stationary point at @xmath144 will be shown to possess elliptic and parabolic sectors . using the symmetry of the equation",
    "it may be assumed that @xmath146 .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that the hubble constant is positive .    to understand the global behavior of solutions to this system first consider the structure of solutions near @xmath141 .",
    "since @xmath147 , it follows that @xmath148 defines a solution curve that adheres to @xmath141 . to find the other adherent solution invoke polar coordinates by the standard relations @xmath149 and @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "the other adherent solution can be located by considering a sector bounded by @xmath153 and a solution of @xmath154 .",
    "note that the equation @xmath154 is quadratic in @xmath155 and may be solved to give radial isoclines @xmath156 we may distinguish radial isoclines by the property that @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "let @xmath159 be the graph of @xmath160 for @xmath146 .",
    "consider a small sector @xmath12 bounded by @xmath153 and @xmath159 .",
    "the vector field @xmath16 exits both radial boundaries of @xmath12 .",
    "first , because @xmath161 and @xmath162 , @xmath16 exits @xmath153 .",
    "second , a taylor expansion for @xmath163 developed along @xmath159 implies that @xmath164 , and consequently , if the sector @xmath12 is chosen sufficiently small , @xmath165 on the segment of @xmath159 bounding @xmath12 . as a result , there must either exist a unique solution or an interval of solutions that tend to @xmath141 as @xmath166 with initial conditions on the arc bounding @xmath12 .    to see that there is a unique solution , examine the first order ode @xmath167 .",
    "introduce the angular operator @xmath168 .",
    "it follows from a generalization of a lemma of lonn that there is a unique solution adhering to @xmath141 , if @xmath169 in the interior of @xmath12 @xcite . to verify this inequality , note that @xmath170 , where @xmath171 is a polynomial of order 14 in @xmath172 and @xmath155 with properties that @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "these facts imply that @xmath171 is negative definite in a neighborhood of the origin , which implies that if @xmath12 is chosen small enough , then @xmath169 on the interior of @xmath12 .",
    "hence , there is a unique solution that adheres to @xmath141 in @xmath12 , and determines a stable manifold @xmath175 for the stationary point @xmath141 .    to understand the global backward time evolution of @xmath175 , first consider the isoclines @xmath176 .",
    "this equation is again quadratic in @xmath155 and has the solutions @xmath177 these isoclines again can be distinguished by @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "the most crucial feature of the graphs of @xmath180 and @xmath181 is the position and sign of the vertical asymptotes .",
    "it can be seen that only @xmath180 possesses an asymptote at @xmath182 while @xmath181 is finite at @xmath183 and has the value @xmath184 .",
    "the sign of the asymptote depends on whether @xmath185 or @xmath186 .",
    "it is easily seen that @xmath187 if @xmath186 and @xmath188 if @xmath185 . also note that both isoclines have the property that @xmath189 .    to understand the relation between the stable manifold @xmath175 and the isocline @xmath190 determined by the graph of @xmath191 , we develop a taylor expansion for @xmath175 at @xmath141 .",
    "we may assume that @xmath175 can be parameterized as the graph of a smooth function @xmath192 ; where @xmath193 must satisfy @xmath194 . to obtain the first two terms in the taylor expansion ,",
    "assume that @xmath195 and substitute into the above expression .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath196 while a taylor expansion for @xmath180 at @xmath141 has the form @xmath197 .",
    "thus the stable manifold @xmath175 lies above isocline @xmath190 .",
    "consequently , the global behavior of @xmath175 is determined by the position of the asymptote @xmath183 .",
    "if @xmath198 or @xmath186 , @xmath175 lies in an unbounded region defined by @xmath153 , @xmath199 and @xmath159 in which case @xmath200 and @xmath201 . since @xmath199 is a solution curve @xmath175 can not intersect it , and thus is asymptotic to it as @xmath202 .",
    "the case where @xmath203 or @xmath185 is quite different .",
    "here @xmath175 lies in a bounded region @xmath204 defined by @xmath153 and @xmath190 ( see fig .",

    "assume @xmath208 .",
    "it is easy to see that the vector field @xmath16 exits @xmath204 along @xmath153 and @xmath205 and enters along @xmath206 .",
    "consequently , in backward time @xmath175 either adheres to the stationary point @xmath143 or leaves @xmath204 along @xmath206 . in latter case since @xmath209 for @xmath210 , and since @xmath199 is a solution , it follows that , if @xmath175 enters the region bounded by @xmath206 , @xmath199 and @xmath211 , it must adhere to @xmath143 .",
    "thus in the case where @xmath203 the manifold @xmath175 is an unstable manifold for @xmath143 and a stable manifold for @xmath141 .    the unstable manifold @xmath212 leaving the stationary point @xmath144 can also be seen to adhere to ( 1,0 ) .",
    "this follows from the fact that the boundary of the unit square @xmath213\\times [ 0,1]$ ] either consists of solutions curves , @xmath148 and @xmath199 , or segments where the vector field is entering . since @xmath212 enters the unit square , it must adhere to a singular point on the boundary .",
    "however , it can not adhere to @xmath141 , since the only inward pointing characteristic direction with angle between @xmath214 and @xmath215 is uniquely associated with @xmath175 .",
    "thus @xmath212 must adhere to @xmath143 .",
    "the final step in understanding the global behavior of the flow of @xmath16 is to analyze the stationary point @xmath143 .",
    "here we shall restrict our attention to the case where @xmath216 ; that is to zero pressure cosmologies . in this limit",

    "numerical results suggest that in fact @xmath242 , and that the last solution adhering to @xmath143 at the angle @xmath236 is @xmath212 . hence it is conjectured that the solution curves @xmath148 for @xmath243 , @xmath175 and @xmath212 form a separatrix for an elliptic sector of the stationary point @xmath143 .    to develop a physical interpretation for these results , first note that the rescaling @xmath128 and einstein s equations imply that points in @xmath140-plane are related to the energy and pressure of cosmological states by the relations @xmath244    the most important integral curve of the vector field @xmath16 for the interpretation of these results is @xmath175 .",
    "it not only approximates the standard cosmological model for large time , but also , in the case where @xmath245 , it originates from an inflationary state . to see this , rescale vector field @xmath16 so that its parameter correctly reflects the time evolution of the original problem ; that is @xmath246 .",
    "this rescaling can be accomplished by representing the solution curve as the graph of @xmath192 , and then solving for @xmath247 by integrating @xmath248 . in the case of @xmath175 at @xmath141 , from above",
    ", we know that @xmath193 has the form @xmath249 where @xmath250 . consequently , integration gives that @xmath251 where @xmath252 .",
    "but , this is just the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the standard model with sectional curvature @xmath253 and density @xmath254 .",
    "thus @xmath175 or solutions close to @xmath175 are candidates for equations of state that give reasonable cosmologies .",
    "following @xmath175 in backward time , it either originates from a state of infinite pressure in the case where @xmath198 , or a state where @xmath255 in the case where @xmath245 .",
    "the latter equation of state is the equation for inflationary cosmology .",
    "the fact that for @xmath256 , cosmological models describe cold matter weakly interacting with radiation indicates that , in this scenario , the inflationary phase is predicted by the current condition of the universe .",
    "note that the energy density at the singularity is @xmath257 .",
    "if @xmath27 is taken to be the planck mass this is consistent with the chaotic inflation hypothesis .    to gain a better insight into the significance of this model for inflationary cosmology ,",
    "requires a more detailed examination of the solutions near the stationary point @xmath143 . using a similar analysis",
    "as was applied at @xmath141 , it can be shown that solution curves that adhere to @xmath143 are the graphs of either @xmath258 where @xmath259 is analytic and @xmath260 or @xmath261 where @xmath262 .",
    "these solutions correspond to the @xmath230 and @xmath236 characteristic directions respectively .",
    "to find @xmath247 solve @xmath263 and set @xmath264 .",
    "in first case with the initial condition @xmath265 , integration gives for @xmath266 , @xmath267 where @xmath268 .",
    "let @xmath269 be the inverse of @xmath270 with @xmath271 , then the solution @xmath247 has the form @xmath272 one significant observation that follows from this expression is that , if @xmath175 is parameterized by the natural time parameter , then the stationary point is reached along @xmath175 in finite time .",
    "in fact , since @xmath273 the singularity is reached at time @xmath274 , @xmath275 .",
    "knowing @xmath247 we may also calculate the scale factor @xmath276 .",
    "integration gives @xmath277 the analysis of this expression shows that , although for small @xmath278 , @xmath130 grows exponentially , exponential growth does not persist long enough to account for inflation . to find true inflationary growth in this model we examine the behavior of solutions adhering to @xmath143 along the characteristic direction @xmath236 .    for solutions adhering along the @xmath236 direction ,",
    "the integral of @xmath279 can be expressed in terms of the initial data @xmath265 and a bounded function @xmath280 , and has the form @xmath281 for @xmath266 .",
    "if the inverse of @xmath282 is @xmath283 , where @xmath284 is also bounded , then @xmath247 has the form @xmath285 hence the scale factor @xmath130 has the form @xmath286 from this expression we see that as @xmath287 the scale factor undergoes exponential growth .",
    "this fact suggests that the solutions of the elliptic sector may be given physical interpretation if it is supposed that the inflationary phase of the universe s development was the final state of a previous cycle .    as final remarks , observe that both the flatness of space and the adherence to the critical density can be deduced from this model , but in a manner quite different from the way in which these conclusions arise in standard inflationary models .",
    "first , the fact that the density of matter must be extremely close to critical density is a consequence of the age of the universe relative to universal time scale @xmath22 . since",
    ", if cosmic evolution did not follow a path extremely close to @xmath175 , it would have suffered a catastrophe before its current age .",
    "the flatness of space is a consequence of the same scaling law , because for large time scales the curvature may be neglected as it is multiplied by a factor of @xmath288 . finally , observe that the stationary point at @xmath143 corresponds to singularity in @xmath106 .",
    "notice that if @xmath289 , then @xmath290 . at such points",
    "@xmath109 is tangent to the null cone of @xmath43 and so space - time at the singularity does not have a well defined spatial metric .",
    "in the previous section the implications of egr are studied for the simplest interesting example , namely friedmann geometries . in general",
    "it is difficult to compute the intrinsic geometry of an arbitrary submanifold @xmath107 of @xmath2 .",
    "although general formulas for the curvature of such submanifolds can be developed , they are not at this point particularly illuminating and so will not be fully exposed here .",
    "rather , this section will demonstrate that if @xmath53 has constant length and @xmath291 is a geodesic vector field , then the difference between the curvature on @xmath292 induced by @xmath93 and @xmath43 depends only on the first three covariant derivatives of @xmath53 , and can be developed in a power series in @xmath85 with first non - vanishing term of order @xmath293 .",
    "thus , the additional terms that appear in the einstein tensor when @xmath43 is used in the place of @xmath93 can be viewed as additions to energy momentum tensor that are coupled to gravity by higher powers of the gravitational constant .    to understand the intrinsic curvature of @xmath107 ,",
    "first calculate the levi - civita connection @xmath294 of @xmath43 on @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath295 be the curvature tensor of the dual levi - civita connection in @xmath2 .",

    ". the orthogonal projection @xmath316 on to the compliment of @xmath109 can be expressed in terms of covariant derivatives of @xmath53 . to see this note that the tangent space to @xmath292 and its compliment are described as the graphs of the endomorphisms @xmath317 and @xmath318",

    "the assumption that @xmath53 is of constant length and closed implies that @xmath328 has the structure of a 3-dimensional symmetric linear map @xmath329 , and hence satisfies the polynomial identity @xmath330 .",
    "the fundamental invariants @xmath331 , @xmath332 and @xmath333 are given in terms of the traces of powers of @xmath329 by the expressions @xmath334 these invariants may be used to reduce @xmath335 to the expression @xmath336    to use these identities to write an expression for @xmath316 in closed form , introduce @xmath337 defined by @xmath338 , and endomorphisms @xmath339 and @xmath340 of @xmath76 and @xmath73 given by @xmath341 and @xmath342 .",
