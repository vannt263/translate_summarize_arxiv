    "based on the intensive multi - wavelength surveys of the zone of avoidance ( zoa ) in the last decade  aimed at addressing cosmological questions about the dynamics of the local group , respectively the possible existence of nearby hidden massive galaxies , dipole determinations based on luminous galaxies , the continuity and size of nearby superclusters , the mapping of cosmic flow fields  enormous progress has been achieved in uncovering the galaxy distribution in this obscured region of the sky ( see kraan - korteweg & lahav 2000 for a review ) .    in particular , the near infrared , whole - sky homogeneous surveys such as 2mass ( see huchra et al .",
    ", these proceedings ) have resulted in a magnificent reduction of the zoa .",
    "however , even this survey does become increasingly incomplete at low galactic latitudes in the larger galactic bulge ( gb ) area ( @xmath6 ) , including the great attractor ( ga ) region .",
    "even if obscured galaxies can be identified , redshifts are difficult if not impossible to obtain at the higher extinction levels . because of the transparency of the galaxy to the 21 cm radiation of neutral hydrogen , systematic hi - surveys are particularly powerful in mapping large - scale structure ( lss ) in this part of the sky .",
    "the redshifted 21 cm emission of hi - rich galaxies are readily detectable at lowest latitudes and highest extinction levels and the signal will furthermore provide immediate redshift and rotational velocity information .",
    "for these reasons , a systematic deep blind hi survey of the southern milky way was begun in 1997 with the multibeam receiver at the 64 m parkes telescope .",
    "the data presented here consist of the preliminary analysis of 27 consecutive slightly overlapping data cubes , offset by @xmath7 , centered on the southern galactic plane ( gp ) : @xmath0 , @xmath8 . the 23 central cubes cover the _ southern _ milky way ( henning et al .",
    ", in prep . ) , while the other four are extensions to the north ( donley et al . , in prep .",
    "the coverage in redshift space is @xmath9km / s . with an integration time of 25",
    "min / beam  respectively 25 scans  an rms = 6mjy is achieved , making this survey sensitive to the lowest mass dwarf galaxies in the local neighborhood and to normal spirals well beyond the ga region .",
    "results based on a shallow subsample of this survey ( 2 out of 25 scans ) were presented in henning et al .",
    "2000 ( henceforth hizss ) and resulted in the detection of 110 mainly nearby galaxies , 67 of which were previously unknown .",
    "a careful analysis of the 27 data cubes by at least two , sometimes three , individual researchers with the subsequent neutral evaluation of inconsistent cases in the detection lists by a third party yields 1075 galaxies .",
    "the final list may vary slightly .",
    "thirty - nine of these galaxies have latitudes above @xmath10 .",
    "as the sensitivity decreases for @xmath11 , and therewith the completeness , these 39 galaxies are not included in the presented graphs and discussions .",
    "figure  1 displays the distribution along the milky way of the in hi detected galaxies .",
    "an inspection of this distribution shows that the hi survey nearly fully penetrates the zoa with hardly any dependence on galactic latitude .",
    "this is confirmed by the left panel in fig .  2 , which shows the detection rate as a function of galactic latitude .",
    "the small dip in the detection rate between @xmath12 stems mainly from the gb regions and to a lesser extent from the ga region ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the former is due to the high number of continuum sources at low latitudes in the gb region , while the latter probably is due to the high galaxian density where a moderate number of continuum sources may already result in a detection - loss for the on average higher velocity , hence fainter , ga galaxies .",
    "this explanation is supported by the fact that this dip is not noticeable in the shallower hizss data ( lower histogram ) .",
    "a much stronger variation is apparent in the number density as a function of galactic longitude ( see also middle panel of fig .  2 ) .",
    "this can be explained entirely with large - scale structure ( see also next section ) such as the nearby  and therefore in hizss prominent  puppis filament ( @xmath14 ) , the hydra - antlia filament ( @xmath15 ) , the very dense ga region ( @xmath16 ) , followed by an underdense region ( @xmath17 ) which is strongly influenced by the local and sagittarius void ( see also hizss histogram ) .",
    "these lss have left their imprint also on the velocity diagram ( right panel of fig .",
    "2 ) , which shows two conspicuous broad peaks .",
    "the low - velocity one is due to a blend of various structures in the gp or crossing the gp ( see next section ) while the second around 5000km / s clearly is due to the ga overdensity , respectively the norma supercluster ( see also fig .  3 ) .",
    "the velocity histogram moreover shows that galaxies are found all the way out to the velocity limit of the survey of @xmath18km / s , hence probe the galaxy distribution considerably deeper than hizss , the hi bright galaxy catalog bgc ( koribalski et al .",
    "2003 ) or the hi parkes all sky survey hipass ( see zwaan et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "figure 3 shows a galactic latitude slice with @xmath8 out to 12000km / s of the 1035 galaxies detected in the deep parkes hizoa survey within @xmath0 .",
    "the first very obvious conclusion when inspecting this figure is that , yes , the hi survey really permits to trace lss in the most opaque part of the zoa in a homogenous way , unbiased by the clumpiness of the foreground dust contamination and shows good coverage out to about 7000km / s .    while discussing some of the most interesting features revealed with fig .",
    "3 , it is suggested to simultaneously consult fig .  4 , which shows the hizoa data with data extracted from leda surrounding the zoa in sky projections for three velocity shells of thickness 3000km / s to show the newly discovered features in context to known structures .",
    "the most prominent lss in fig .",
    "3 certainly is the _ norma supercluster _ which seems in this plot to stretch from @xmath19 to @xmath20 , lying always just below the 6000km / s circle , with a weakly visible extension towards vela ( @xmath21 ) at 6 - 7000km / s .",
    "the latter is stronger at latitudes above the hizoa ( see panel 2 and 3 in fig .  4 ) .",
    "this wall - like feature seems to consist of various concentrations , where the one around @xmath22 is seen for the first time in the hizoa .",
    "because of the high extinction there , it can not be assessed whether this overdensity extends further than @xmath23 .",
    "the clump at @xmath24 is due to the low - latitude side of the norma cluster a3627 at ( @xmath25km / s ; kraan - korteweg et al.1996 ) .",
    "the next two due to groups / clusters at @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively , both at @xmath28 , are very distinct in the middle panel of fig",
    ".  4 . between these two clusters at",
    "slightly higher latitude we see a small finger of god , which belongs to the by woudt ( 1998 ) identified centaurus - crux cluster .",
    "this is not the only overdensity in the ga region .",
    "a significant agglomeration of galaxies is evident closer by at @xmath29km / s ) with two filaments merging into it .",
    "although no finger of god is visible ( never very noteable in hi redshift slices ) , this concentration forms part of the by kraan - korteweg & woudt ( 1999 ) suspected heavily obscured cluster ( @xmath30 ) around the strong radio source pks1343@xmath2601 . a deep @xmath31-band survey ( kraan - korteweg et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "as well @xmath32 imaging of its core ( nagayama et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    "are consistent with this being an intermediate size cluster similar to hydra .",
    "although the overdensity in the ga region looks remarkable here , a preliminary analysis of the 4 cubes covering @xmath33 by staveley - smith et al .  2000 shows an excess mass above the background of only @xmath34 .    to the left of the ga overdensity we find an underdense region conformed of the _ local void _ and the _ sagittarius void _ at about @xmath35 and central velocities of @xmath36 and 4500km / s ( quite conspicous also in the first two panels of fig .  4 ) .",
    "except for the tiny group of galaxies at about ( @xmath37km / s ) , the distribution here and in fig .",
    "4 rather suggest one big void than two seperate ones .    the righthand side of fig .",
    "4 is quite crowded , in particular the puppis region ( @xmath38 ) with its two nearby groups ( 800 and 1500km / s ) followed by the hydra wall at about 3000 km / s that extends from the monocerus group ( @xmath39 ) to the concentration at @xmath40 .",
    "the latter is not the signature of a group but due to a filament emerging out of the antlia cluster ( @xmath41 ; see fig .",
    "4 ) . regarding the here",
    "recognized possible filamentary connection between the monocerus group and antlia ( top panel fig .",
    "4 ) , the dinosaur that left its footprint on our universe must actually have been four - toed and not three - toed as envisioned by lynden - bell .",
    "while searching the data cube z264 , centered on @xmath42 , an exceptionally strong signal ( @xmath43mjy ) for its very high velocity ( @xmath44km / s ) was identified . with the very broad width of the signal ( @xmath45km / s ) ,",
    "the data was indicative of a galaxy of hi mass @xmath46 ( assuming @xmath47 ; h@xmath48km / s / mpc ) .",
    "this would place it amongst the most massive spiral galaxies known to date , in the range of , e.g. , malin  1 ( @xmath49 ; bothun et al .",
    "1987 ; pickering & impey 1997 ) .",
    "surprising , considering the fact that no equivalently massive galaxy was uncovered in the recent systematic hi sky - survey bgc ( n = 1000 galaxies ) and only one with @xmath50 in hipass ( n = 4300 , kilborn , priv .",
    "comm . ) , even though the probability of detecting galaxies in this mass range is smaller for the zoa survey compared to both the bgc and hipass .",
    "indeed the steep exponential fall - off at the high mass end of the hi mass function ( himf ) below @xmath51 ( zwaan et al .",
    "2003 , based on bgc ; @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , see his fig .",
    "4 ) is so strong , that the above galaxy candidate would lie well beyond the by them obtained himf  though it must be maintained that the volume densities of such high mass galaxies still remain ill - constrained .",
    "an optical counterpart could not be identified which actually was hardly likely with a foreground extinction of @xmath55 ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) at the position in the sky of @xmath56 .",
    "both the denis and 2mass infrared surveys reveal , however , two possible weak counterparts .    the confirmation of this galaxy as an individual galaxy and therewith its mass will help narrow down the number density of these rare objects , an important value for galaxy formation and evolution models .",
    "the galaxy candidate was then observed in february 2003 with the australia telescope compact array atca ( 12hrs in 750d configuration ; 6.6km / s velocity resolution after hanning smoothing ; donley et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . as can be verified from fig .  5 , which shows the profiles from both observations , the atca spectral line profile is entirely consistent with the parkes mb detection .",
    "the galaxy hizoaj0836@xmath243 is in fact a single system ( see fig .",
    "6 ) at a velocity of @xmath57km / s . with a linewidth of",
    "@xmath58km / s and a flux of @xmath59jykm / s , the atca observations do confirm the high mass of this object , providing a final value of @xmath60 .    in april 2003",
    ", the anglo australian telescope ( aat ) was used to obtain @xmath61- and @xmath62-band images .",
    "figure  6 shows the 6 x 6 arcmin @xmath61-band image with the velocity integrated hi - emission overlaid .",
    "there are two galaxies in the field of view , both of which have counterparts in the 2mass extended source catalog .",
    "the galaxy 2masxj08365157@xmath24337407 , at an offset of only @xmath63 and a similar inclination angle as the hi gas , clearly is the optical counterpart . the second visible galaxy seems at similar distance but was not detected .",
    "this is not really surprising as this galaxy , to have been detected with our atca observation , should have an hi - mass of over @xmath64 which is high for a normal fairly face - on galaxy .",
    "the hi and @xmath61-band morphology do not show any obvious sign of interaction between the galaxies .    with an inclination of @xmath65 ( from @xmath61-band photometry ) and a linear radius of 50kpc",
    ", the dynamical mass turns out to be @xmath66 , also amongst the highest ever measured for spiral galaxies .",
    "_ discussion :  _ is this galaxy a new example of the giant lsb class galaxies like malin  1 ? the observations clearly do not support this .",
    "the rotation curve is steep in the center , remaining constant at large radii , consistent with normal spiral galaxies having a dark matter halo that extends well beyond the optical disk .",
    "the galaxy has a hsb bulge of about 4kpc  and a disk that can be traced out to 20kpc , even with the extinction in @xmath61 of @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , the hi density peak is a factor of @xmath68 higher compared to values measured for lsb giant spiral galaxies by pickering et al.(1997 ) and the star formation rates determined from our radio continuum data , as well as from iras far infrared fluxes ( cao et al.2003 ) indicate a healthy star formation rate of about @xmath69 .",
    "hizoaj0836@xmath243 therewith has the properites of a normal hsb spiral galaxy albeit of extreme mass .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that it fits perfectly on the @xmath70-band tully  fisher relation as determined by macri et al.(2003 ) . as such",
    ", this galaxy is an interesting object to study in further detail ",
