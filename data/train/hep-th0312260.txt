    "boundary string field theory ( bsft ) @xcite has been proposed as a background independent formulation of open - string field theory and exploited in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the configuration space of open - string fields is identified with the space of two - dimensional field theories with arbitrary interactions on the boundary and a fixed conformal invariant world - sheet action in the bulk .",
    "an odd - symplectic structure on the space of the open - string fields is given by the two - point functions of the world - sheet theories with the boundary interactions .",
    "a nilpotent fermionic vector field is introduced as a certain limit of the bulk brst operator .",
    "the string field action is determined from the above vector field and the odd - symplectic structure by using the batalin - vilkovisky formalism .",
    "however , the original construction of @xcite is purely formal . due to the short - distance divergences of the world - sheet theories , an introduction of the space of the boundary interactions and the odd - symplectic structure requires some regularization procedure .",
    "there is also an ambiguity in the definition of the nilpotent vector field and the notion of the classical equation of motion in the bsft is still not clear .    in this paper",
    ", we will clarify these issues and make the first - step towards a constructive formulation of the bsft .",
    "the aim of the present work are to provide a concrete construction of the boundary interactions within the cut - off theory , and to illustrate how the classical open - string interactions are extracted from the boundary interactions which are described in the world - sheet theory terminology . in order to be explicit",
    ", we will consider the bps @xmath0-branes of the type ii superstring theory in a constant ns - ns two - form background , and investigate the boundary interactions with the off - shell gauge fields on the branes .",
    "the first quantization of open - string becomes intractable when the superconformal invariance of the world - sheet theory is broken on the boundary .",
    "however , if not broken in the bulk , the closed - string theory is quantized still in the conformal field theoretical method , and the boundary state formalism @xcite developed in @xcite will provide an appropriate framework for the description of the boundary interactions .",
    "the relevant boundary states are the states which do not satisfy the ishibashi conditions ( more precisely , the closed - string brst invariance ) . in section 2 we construct the boundary states with arbitrary numbers of gluons .",
    "the resultant boundary states correctly include the open - string interactions , and reproduce the corresponding open - string one - loop amplitudes .",
    "our construction in this paper is limited to the closed - string ns - ns sector .",
    "this is sufficient to see the classical physics of the open - string ns sector ( disk amplitudes of gluons ) , which is dealt with by the ns - ns sector .",
    "the boundary interaction of closed - string with arbitrary configurations of the gauge field on the brane is obtained from the above boundary states . in section 3 ,",
    "the boundary interaction is constructed in the closed - string hilbert space by integrating the gluon boundary states over the moduli spaces of the path - ordered points on the boundary and summing them over the number of the gluons .",
    "the uv divergences of the open - string interactions arise when the gluon vertices collide with one another on the boundary .",
    "we will therefore make a point - splitting regularization by restricting the integrations over the moduli spaces so that intervals between any two gluon vertices on the boundary can not be less than a small cut - off parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we also modify the path - ordering procedure to respect the global world - sheet supersymmetry , following to @xcite .",
    "it is observed in @xcite that the global world - sheet supersymmetry controls the short - distance divergences of the world - sheet theories .",
    "the resultant boundary state is denoted by @xmath3;\\eta\\bigr\\rangle_{tot}$ ] .",
    "it represents the boundary interaction with the off - shell gauge field on the brane . for another approach to the boundary interaction ,",
    "see @xcite .    in the loop space approach to string field theory @xcite ,",
    "the interactions are introduced by adding the string field vertices to the string field action . while , in bsft , the interactions of the open - string fields should be extracted from the world - sheet boundary interaction . in section 4",
    ", we will overview the mechanism .",
    "we investigate the action of the closed - string brst operator @xmath4 on @xmath3;\\eta\\bigr\\rangle_{tot}$ ] .",
    "the use of the closed - string brst operator is required by the background independence .",
    "since the closed - string brst operator does not include any coupling of the open - strings , the brst invariance condition formally leads the linearized equation of motion for the gluons .",
    "however , the action of the closed - string brst operator on the gluon vertices includes total - derivative terms . with the above point - splitting regularization",
    ", the total - derivative terms do not vanish in the integrals and contribute as the boundary terms of the regularized moduli space .",
    "these boundary terms turn out to provide the non - linear brst transformation of the open - string fields .",
    "the zero of this non - linear brst transformation gives the non - linear equation of motion .",
    "in this course , the leading contribution of each boundary term becomes too singular at @xmath5 .",
    "typically it behaves as @xmath6 .",
    "the origin is the propagation of the open - string unphysical particles @xcite .",
    "these unpleasant terms turn out to cancel with the contact terms which are brought about by the supersymmetric path - ordering procedure .",
    "the leading contributions are cancelled , and the next - to - leading contributions , which describe the propagation of the gluons , become the non - linear corrections to the brst transformation and the equation of motion .    in the constant ns - ns two - form background , it is known @xcite that the gauge field @xmath7 on the brane acquires the non - commutativity and that the equation of motion for the gauge field becomes non - linear : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the covariant derivative and the field strength of the non - commutative gauge theory . in section 5 , we compute the brst invariance condition of the world - sheet boundary interaction at the @xmath1-order and confirm that the condition @xmath11;\\eta\\bigr\\rangle_{tot}=0 $ ] leads to the non - linear equation of motion ( [ intro1 ] ) .",
    "we would notice that the above mechanism to extract the non - linear equation of motion is not restricted to the present non - commutative case .",
    "it can be easily generalized to the non - abelian yang - mills equation by associating the chan - paton factors with the gluon vertices .    in the original attempts to formulate string field theory as a theory of `` all two - dimensional quantum field theories ''",
    ", it was suggested in @xcite that the classical equation of motion for string fields is given by the renormalization group equation of the world - sheet theories . in section 6",
    ", the boundary interaction is examined from the perspective of the world - sheet renormalization group . in our boundary state formulation , the beta functions of the boundary couplings @xmath12 are defined by the following condition : @xmath13;\\eta\\;\\bigr\\rangle_{tot } = -\\epsilon\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\epsilon}\\ ; \\bigl|\\;w_{\\epsilon}[a];\\eta\\;\\bigr\\rangle_{tot}\\;.\\label{intro2}\\ ] ] they become linear if the @xmath2-dependence of the regularized moduli spaces is neglected . by taking account of the @xmath2-dependence of the regularized moduli spaces , the beta functions turn to acquire the non - linearity : @xmath14 these beta functions coincide with the non - linear brst transformations of the open - string fields .",
    "therefore the action of @xmath4 on @xmath3;\\eta\\bigr\\rangle_{tot}$ ] is identified with the beta functions .",
    "this provides a concrete definition of the nilpotent vector field in the batalin - vilkovisky formulation of the bsft .",
    "gauge structure of the bsft can be also studied from our approach .",
    "it will be reported elsewhere @xcite .    finally , we comment on a possible extension of our formulation of the classical bsft to the quantum bsft .",
    "the quantum open - string theory inevitably contains the closed - string degrees of freedom .",
    "the resultant string field theory is an open - closed string field theory in which the closed - string interactions are encoded in the closed - string field vertices while the open - string interactions are encoded in the boundary states @xmath3;\\eta\\bigr\\rangle_{tot}$ ] .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath7 is deformed from @xmath11;\\eta\\bigr\\rangle_{tot}=0 $ ] by the closed - string interaction , and becomes to contain the interaction between @xmath3;\\eta\\bigr\\rangle_{tot}$ ] . from the space - time viewpoint ,",
    "the boundary states @xmath3;\\eta\\bigr\\rangle_{tot}$ ] correspond to the wilson loops of the gauge theory on the branes .",
    "the deformed equation of motion may be the string theoretical realization of the loop equation of the gauge theory , and the closed - string brst operator @xmath15 corresponds to the loop laplacian @xcite .",
    "we hope that the progress along this line will shed light on the issues of the open - closed string duality .",
    "in the present section , we make a description of the open - string degrees of freedom on a non - commutative d - brane in terms of the boundary state formalism .",
    "our study is restricted to the massless particles in the open - string theory - gluons , and the closed - string ns - ns sector .",
    "this section has two parts . as a set - up ,",
    "boundary states without any open - string leg are briefly reviewed in the first subsection . in the second subsection ,",
    "we construct boundary states with arbitrary numbers of gluons , with the method developed in @xcite .",
    "the resultant boundary states by themselves capture the open - string tree interactions .",
    "the tree propagation between the boundary states correctly reproduce the open - string one - loop amplitudes .",
    "the brst invariance of the boundary state with one - gluon leads to the linearized equation of motion for the gluon .",
    "let us consider type ii superstring theory with a non - commutative d@xmath16-brane .",

    "an explicit form of @xmath37 is given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the @xmath52 invariant vacuum of the ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) cft .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath53 is determined by factorizing open - string annulus partition function in the closed - string channel .",
    "the complete boundary state is obtained by tensoring @xmath37 with states for the conformal ghosts @xmath54 and for the superconformal ghost @xmath55 : @xmath56 the boundary states @xmath57 and @xmath58 are given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the @xmath52 invariant vacuum of the conformal ghost system and @xmath61 is the ground state of the superconformal ghost system in the ( @xmath62,@xmath62 ) picture .",

    "the boundary states @xmath57 and @xmath58 enjoy the overlap conditions @xmath64 combining these conditions with the ishibashi conditions ( [ ishibashi ] ) , one can easily check that the complete boundary state @xmath65 is annihilated by the closed - string brst operator @xmath66    the boundary state ( [ complete ] ) depends on the value of @xmath67 .",
    "the gso projection of the closed - string theory selects a specific combination of the two values of @xmath68 . in the ns - ns sector , the gso projection operator is defined by @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the fermion number operator and the superghost number operator : @xmath72 and similarly for @xmath73 and @xmath74 of the anti - chiral sector .",
    "the gso projection operator ( [ gso ] ) acts on the boundary state @xmath65 as follows : @xmath75 in the absence of any open - string leg , boundary states in the r - r sector are also constructed in @xcite .",
    "we now construct the boundary states which describe the gauge field living on the d - brane . for a while",
    ", our attention will be concentrated on the matter part .",

    "let @xmath76 be an anti - commuting coordinate on the world - sheet boundary .",
    "the one - dimensional superspace consists of the pair ( @xmath77 , @xmath76 ) .",

    ", we get analogues of the open - string tachyon and gluon vertex operators as follows : @xmath82    let us overview how the operators in the closed - string theory describe the open - string interactions , with the help of the boundary state @xmath37 . the overlap conditions ( [ overlap ] ) say that the annihilation operators with respect to the boundary state @xmath37 are @xmath83 rather than the lowering operators @xmath84 , @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) and @xmath87 , @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) .",

    "the modified normal - ordering and ope reproduce the open - string interactions .",
