    "on the other hand , dynamical decoherence properties of many - body systems @xcite are basically significant by itself .",
    "there have been several work about the decoherence and spin chain channels @xcite .",

    "ii we investigate the efficiency of quantum spin channels in one common spin environment . in sec .",
    "iii the situation of local independent environment is discussed . in sec .",
    "iv are conclusions and some discussions .",
    "we start by considering the important decoherence model in spin systems , i.e. one common spin environment .",
    "the hamiltonian of the spin chain with @xmath0 spins is denoted as @xmath3 .",
    "the total z - component of the spin is conserved , i.e. @xmath4=0 $ ] .",
    "this is true for several important spin chain channels @xcite .",
    "the central system interacts with one common spin environment @xmath5 @xcite , which is formed by @xmath6 independent spins , for large values of @xmath6 , as depicted in fig . 1 .",
    "@xmath7    the whole system of the spin chain @xmath8 and the environment @xmath5 is described by the hamiltonian @xmath9 here the self - hamiltonian of the environment @xmath5 is neglected .",
    "this simple decoherence model is an important solvable model of decoherence , which are much relevant to quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate how efficient the quantum spin chain channels will work in such a decoherence environment .",
    "the quantum state to be transferred is located at the @xmath10 spin , @xmath11 .",
    "the initial state of the central system is @xmath12 with @xmath13 , @xmath14 . in the following of this paper",
    ", we will denote @xmath15 the state in which the @xmath16 spin is in the @xmath17 state , while all the other spins are in the @xmath18 state . without the influence of decoherence",
    ", the transfer fidelity at time @xmath19 is defined as @xmath20 . using the calculations in @xcite ,",
    "we can write down the final density matrix @xmath21 in the absence of the decoherence , just in terms of the initial coefficients of the input state , and the transfer fidelity , as follows @xmath22    now we take into account the interaction between the spin chain and the environment .",
    "we denote the basis of the environment @xmath23 , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 with @xmath26 . since @xmath27 , therefore , @xmath28 .",
    "the time evolution operator for the combined system - environment is @xmath29 , i.e. , @xmath30 where @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "we consider the initial state of the spin chain together with the @xmath6 independent environment spins of the form as w.h .",
    "zurek has considered in @xcite : @xmath33    after arbitrary time @xmath19 , the evolution of the spin - environment system is @xmath34    we note that @xmath35=0 $ ] .",
    "it can be observed that if the the environment is in the state @xmath36 , the output just undergoes a @xmath37-rotation by some angle @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath39 consequently , the only change to the final density matrix caused by the decoherence is to reduce the off - diagonal elements by a factor of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the efficiency of the quantum spin channel is characterized by the fidelity averaged over all pure state in the bloch sphere , that is @xmath42d\\omega$ ] .",
    "we denote the character function of the environment as @xmath43 . after some straightforward calculation , we can write the average fidelity of the quantum spin channel in the spin environment as @xmath44 where @xmath45 . for a general spin environment of large @xmath6 values ,",
    "the character function @xmath46 is approximately gaussian @xcite , that is @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath48 , and the average fidelity becomes @xmath49    * _ heisenberg spin chain _ * we first consider the s. bose primitive scheme .",
    "there are @xmath0 spins in the line with ferromagnetic heisenberg interactions , labeled @xmath50 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the spin chain @xcite is @xmath51 .",
    "for the situation without considering the influence of decoherence environment , by choosing the magnetic fields @xmath52 as some special value @xmath53 , one can make the transfer fidelity @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath55 , and then maximized the original average fidelity . therefore , the average fidelity of the quantum spin channel in the spin environment is @xmath56    we depict the above average fidelity for @xmath57 in fig .",
    "2 . compared with the original fidelity @xcite @xmath58",
    ", it can be seen that the decoherence environment will obviously reduce the efficiency of quantum communication through the spin chain channels , especially for the target spin of long distance . because if the time of transfer is longer , the decoherence effects are more severe and more quantum state information will be lost .",
    "in fact , without the influence of decoherence , the critical spin chain length is @xmath59 , i.e. , if the spin chain length @xmath60 , the fidelity of quantum communication through the spin channel will exceed @xmath61 , which is the highest fidelity for classical transmission of the state @xcite .",
    "however , even the environment parameter @xmath62 is small , the critical spin chain length is significantly reduced .",
    "we list the critical spin chain length for several environment parameters in the following table .",
    "therefore , if the spin chain length is large , to achieve satisfactory efficiency of quantum state transfer , new constraints , e.g. larger coupling strength @xmath63 , is necessary .",
    "we now investigate entanglement distribution through the above open ended spin channel in the one common spin environment .",
    "two particles @xmath64 and @xmath65 are initially in the entangled state @xmath66 .",
    "we set @xmath65 as the first site of the spin chain channel , then after some time @xmath19 entanglement will be established between @xmath64 and the target spin , i.e. the @xmath67 spin .",
    "what we are interested in is the amount of distributed entanglement between @xmath64 and the @xmath67 spin . as pointed out in @xcite , the spin chain , without the influence of environment",
    ", acts as an amplitude damping quantum channel , i.e. @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in the same way as discussed above , the final entangled state becomes @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , the distributed entanglement measured by concurrence @xcite is , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the distributed entanglement without decoherence .",
    "* _ mirror - periodic hamiltonian _ *",
    "now we consider the perfect state transfer channels , i.e. , the mirror - periodic hamiltonian scheme in one common spin environment .",
    "the @xmath0 spins in the line with xy coupling is described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",
    "the most important property of the mirror - periodic hamiltonian is that @xmath78 for some time @xmath19 . for the above hamiltonian @xmath3 ,",
    "the transfer fidelity is @xmath79^{n-1}$ ] , i.e. perfect quantum state transfer will be achieved at a constant time @xmath80 for arbitrary spin chain distance .",
    "according to the above eqs.(8 , 9 ) , we can easily get the average fidelity @xmath81 since the optimal transfer time @xmath80 is constant , the average fidelity is independent on the spin chain length @xmath0 .",
    "this is different from the situation of heisenberg spin chain channel .",
    "in this section , we will consider another representative decoherence model , the local independent environment .",
    "each individual spin of the central system @xmath8 interacts independently with the local environment @xmath82 , as depicted in fig .",
    "4 . the decoherence process of the multi - spin system can be described by a general quantum master equation of lindblad form @xcite , @xmath83+\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n } ( \\mathbf{i}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes\\mathbf{i}\\otimes\\mathcal{l}_{i}\\otimes\\mathbf{i}\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes\\mathbf{i})\\rho\\ ] ] the superoperator @xmath84 describes the independent interaction of the @xmath85 spin with the local environment .",
    "it is known that macroscopic systems are more fragile under the influence of the decoherence environment . in the situation of local independent decoherence environment , this can be demonstrated in an explicit way as follows .",
    "the phenomenological analysis solution of the quantum master equation in eq.(15 ) can be written as @xmath86+\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mathcal{l}_{i}\\rho(t')dt'\\}$ ] .",
    "and the ideal state without decoherence is @xmath87\\}$ ] .",
    "if the time @xmath88 is short enough , the difference between the real and ideal state of the central system is @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , it is obvious that the state deviation will become larger as @xmath0 increases for most kinds of decoherence model .    *",
    "_ mirror - periodic hamiltonian _ * we first consider the mirror - periodic hamiltonian scheme in the local independent dephasing and damping channels",
    ".    _ dephasing channel _ the dephasing process corresponds to the situation where only phase information is lost @xcite , without energy exchange .",
    "the superoperator for the dephasing channel @xcite is @xmath90 for simplicity , we assume the system - environment coupling strength @xmath91 are the same for all spins .    in the case of quantum state transfer ,",
    "the initial state of the system is @xmath92 .",
    "the state transfer dynamics under the influence of dephasing channel is completely determined by the evolution in the _ zero _ and _ single _ excitation subspace @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , we only need to solve the above master equation in this @xmath94dimensional subspace . when restricted to the subspace @xmath95 , @xmath96    at time @xmath97 , the reduced density of the @xmath67 spin is @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , the probability of an excitation transfer from the @xmath10 spin to the @xmath67 spin at time @xmath80 is @xmath101 . and",
    "the fidelity between the real and ideal transferred quantum state , i.e. @xmath102 , is @xmath103    the efficiency of quantum communication through the above quantum spin channel is characterized by the average fidelity over all pure states in the bloch sphere @xmath104 . in the mirror - periodic hamiltonian scheme , we solve the above differential equations numerically , and depict the probability of an excitation transfer and the average fidelity in fig . 5 and 6 .",
    "though the transfer time is constant @xmath80 for any spin chain distance @xmath0 , the probability of an excitation transfer and the average fidelity will still decay as the spin chain length increases . due to the decoherence effects , the mirror - periodic hamiltonian scheme can not achieve perfect quantum state transfer again .",
    "however , using larger nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath105 , i.e. relative smaller system - environment coupling strength @xmath106 , we will increase the efficiency of quantum communication in the decoherence environment .",
    "_ damping channel _ the pure damping channel corresponds to the decay process of the central system coupled to a thermal bath at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the superoperator for the damping channel is @xmath107 where @xmath108 , with the system - environment coupling strength @xmath91 for all spins .    in the similar way as the dephasing channel , when restricted to the subspace @xmath95 , @xmath109 the reduced density of the @xmath67 spin and the average fidelity in eqs.(18 , 19 ) are applicable to the damping channel too . by solving the corresponding differential master equations numerically ,",
    "we can obtain the probability of an excitation transfer and the average fidelity for different spin chain length @xmath0 .",
    "unlike the situation of the dephasing channel , we find that at time @xmath80 , the probability of an excitation transfer is independent on the spin chain length , that is @xmath110 .",
    "moreover , the average fidelity @xmath111 is independent on the spin chain length either .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising .",
    "whether this property is only hold by the mirror - periodic hamiltonian in a pure damping environment is an interesting open problem , which will be investigated in details in our following work .    *",
    "_ heisenberg spin chain _ * for the heisenberg spin chain channel in the local independent dephasing and damping environment , we can express the system hamiltonian @xmath3 in the subspace @xmath95 and solve the quantum master equations in the similar way as discussed above .",
    "we list the maximum probability of an excitation transfer @xmath112 for different spin chain length @xmath0 in the following table .",
    "the behavior of the average fidelity @xmath113 is similar to the probability of an excitation transfer @xmath112 .",
    "it can be seen that , the maximum probability of an excitation transfer , i.e. the efficiency of the heisenberg spin chain channel , will decay as the spin chain length @xmath0 increases not only for the dephasing channel but also for the damping channel .",
    "this is slightly different from the situation of mirror - periodic hamiltonian , where the probability of an excitation transfer and the average fidelity are independent on the spin chain length .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the efficiency of quantum communication through the spin chain channels under the influence of a decoherence environment .",
    "we focus on the heisenberg spin chain and the mirror - periodic hamiltonian scheme .",
    "two representative decoherence models are considered , one is the one common spin environment , the other is local independent environment . it can be seen that the efficiency of the quantum wires will be significantly lowered by the external decoherence environment . generally speaking ,",
    "the decoherence effects become more serious for larger spin chain length",
    ". however , for different spin chain hamiltonian and decoherence models , the results will be somewhat different .    in refs @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that in some specific environment , quantum state transfer is possible with the same fidelity and only reasonable slowing .",
    "however , for more general decoherence models as considered in this paper , we show that , to achieve highly efficient long distance quantum state transfer in a decoherence environment , the time of transfer @xcite becomes a crucial factor and more constraints on the spin system hamiltonian are requisite .",
    "we should resort to new encoding strategy for the protection of quantum state information during the transfer along the spin chain channels .",
    "besides , we provide some possible evidence for the unusual dynamical decoherence properties of the mirror - periodic hamiltonian , which may lead to some valuable utilities of this special class of hamiltonian .",
