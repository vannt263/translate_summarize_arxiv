    "one way to study the connection between this bimodal population of galaxies is through correlations between specific star formation rate ( ssfr@xmath6sfr / m@xmath7 ) and parameters describing various physical properties of galaxies , such as stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite reported that the density threshold increases with redshift , at least out to @xmath1=3 .",
    "as stellar density and velocity dispersion are closely related ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , observations therefore indicate that galaxies are statistically more likely to be quiescent once they have surpassed a threshold in either density or velocity dispersion .",
    "@xcite showed that these distant compact galaxies have similar densities to the central regions of local ellipticals by comparing their average stellar density profiles within a constant physical radius of 1 kpc ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "this study was the first to present a plausible link between these high redshift galaxies and where they end up in the local universe , but it is yet unclear what causes the quenching in the first place .",
    "this work does however suggest that it may be more robust to define a quenching threshold in surface density within the _ central _ 1 kpc , as opposed to the half - light radius .",
    "@xcite find that this central density threshold increases with stellar mass through a study of the correlation between galaxy structure and the quenching of star formation using a sample of sdss central galaxies .",
    "@xcite extended the @xmath1=0 sdss study of @xcite out to @xmath1=3 . where the earlier work of @xcite found an evolving effective surface density threshold with redshift , @xcite do not find a strong redshift evolution in the central surface density threshold",
    "however , as there still exist star - forming galaxies above this quenching threshold , results in the literature conclude that a dense bulge is a necessary but insufficient condition to fully quench galaxies ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "while most studies have focused on the the stellar mass dependence of the central density alone , it is perhaps unsurprising that there is a tight correlation : the central density is a biproduct of the combined stellar mass and light profile",

    "we derive uncertainties in the average star formation rates from 50 monte carlo bootstrap simulations of the stacking analyses .",
    "the error in the mean is therefore the width of the resulting distribution of star formation rates divided by the square root of the number of galaxies in each bin .",
    "we choose to use the spitzer / mips 24@xmath8 m ir sfr because of the resolution and depth of the observations , and to mitigate systematic uncertainties when combining different sfr indicators .",
    "however , we note that the observed 24@xmath8 m samples major spectral features arising from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) . despite complications from these pah features , @xcite demonstrate that the luminosity - independent conversion from 24@xmath8 m to the bolometric ir luminosity used here yields estimates that are in good median agreement with measurements from herschel / pacs photometry ( see also * ? ? ? * and b. lee et al . in prep ) . when combining the 24@xmath8 m ir sfr indicator with the rest - frame uv , we can therefore successfully recover the average total amount of star formation in galaxies .",
    "while considering the average correlations and including a bootstrap error analysis will reduce the potential noise in these measurements , we can not rule out that there exist biases due to the physical conditions of the dust and the star formation itself that are incredibly difficult to quantify .",
    "given the observed projected two dimensional surface density , the surface brightness distribution can be deprojected to obtain a three dimensional light distribution if we assume spherical symmetry .",
    "we derive this three - dimensional density profile from the best - fit structural parameters to the intensity profiles of the individual galaxies described in section  [ sec : structure ] .",
    "the projected luminosity within a projected radius is described in @xcite , assuming isotropic spherical galaxies with surface luminosity profiles following the srsic profile .",
    "we adopt the asymptotic approximation for the term @xmath27 from @xcite .",
    "this asymptotic expansion is truncated to the first four terms and is accurate to @xmath28 for exponential disks ( @xmath5=1 ) and @xmath29 for a de vaucouleur profile ( @xmath5=4 ) .",
    "the approximation for @xmath27 presented in @xcite performs much better than previous formulae ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and others ) .",
    "however , despite the accuracy of the asymptotic expansion , we note that this methodology may lead to errors for galaxies that are far from spherical symmetry , in particular for flat disks .",
    "we return to this issue in section  [ sec : density ] .",
    "following the equations summarized in section 2.2 of @xcite , we perform an abel transform to deproject the circularized , three - dimensional light profile . assuming mass follows the light and there are no strong color gradients , the total luminosity is converted to a total stellar mass using the stellar masses presented in @xcite .",
    "these stellar masses ( labeled @xmath30 below ) are derived by modeling the spectral energy distributions and correspond to the final 3d - hst data release .",
    "following @xcite , we apply a small correction to these stellar masses to take into account the difference between the total magnitude in the photometric catalog and the total magnitude implied by the srsic fit ( see * ? ? ?",
    "on average , this correction is 1.03@xmath20.11 .",
    "the central density is therefore calculated by numerically integrating the following equation :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the total , aperture - corrected luminosity of the galaxy from the 3d - hst catalogs in the filter corresponding to the srsic profile measurement ( e.g. , @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) .",
    "@xmath33 is the total luminosity as measured from integrating the best - fit srsic profile . in 10% of the cases ,",
    "the numerical integration does not converge and these unreliable measurements are removed from the subsequent analysis .",
    "we find that these galaxies generally have gaussian profiles with @xmath5=0.45@xmath20.14 , larger than average sizes with @xmath9=3.4@xmath21.5 kpc , and low stellar masses within @xmath340.5 dex of the stellar mass limits ; these galaxies represent precisely the population one might expect to fail . while we are effectively using the same formalism as @xcite , who derive the `` core '' mass within the central 1 kpc , we instead parameterize the central density and circular velocity within 1 kpc to facilitate comparisons to earlier results by @xcite .",
    "we note that these derived parameters are essentially equivalent , modulo constant factors , where m@xmath35@xmath36@xmath37@xmath36@xmath38 .        to quantify the errors on the central density , we perform 50 bootstrap simulations of this numerical integration , perturbing @xmath9 and @xmath5 by pseudo random offsets drawn from a gaussian distribution with a standard deviation equal to the respective 1@xmath39 errors , as calculated by @xcite .",
    "the width of the resulting distribution of central densities is taken as the error on each individual measurement .",
    "the error on the average central density for each bin is then the square root of the sum of the errors in quadrature divided by the number of galaxies in the bin .",
    "if we balance the gravitational force acting on the mass enclosed within the central 1 kpc with the centrifugal force , assuming spherical symmetry , the circular velocity of a test particle at radius @xmath40=1 kpc will be ,    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the gravitational constant and equal to 4.302@xmath4310@xmath44 kpc m@xmath45 ( km / s)@xmath46 , and the stellar mass enclosed within the central 1 kpc sphere is determined from equation  [ eq : rho1 ] .",
    "the central circular velocity is a factor of @xmath47 greater than the velocity dispersion , which both @xcite and @xcite study .",
    "we again caution that we must be careful to test that the results presented herein are not driven by flat galaxies , which deviate from the assumption of spherical symmetry .",

    "in figure  [ fig : size ] , we present the rest - frame 5000  size of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass in three redshift intervals , 0.5@xmath0@xmath1@xmath01.0 , 1.0@xmath0@xmath1@xmath01.5 , and 1.5@xmath0@xmath1@xmath02.5 . the data are grouped into 0.2 dex bins of logarithmic stellar mass and size .",
    "the size of the symbol represents the number of galaxies that populate that area in parameter space .",
    "the symbols are color - coded by the ssfr derived from the uv+ir stacking analysis , with open symbols signifying upper limits .",
    "whereas all galaxies are included in the left panels , the middle and right panels are separated into the star - forming and quiescent populations as determined from rest - frame u - v and v - j colors .",
    "the middle and right panels of figure  [ fig : size ] additionally show the size - mass contours in greyscale of the opposite population , quiescent and star - forming respectively .    for the overall galaxy population ( figure  [ fig : size ] , left ) , galaxies with smaller sizes at fixed stellar mass are forming stars at lower rates .",
    "we confirm the earlier results of @xcite and numerous others , who show that the compact sizes of more massive quiescent galaxies are offset from the average size of star - forming galaxies by factors of approximately four at fixed stellar mass at least out to @xmath1@xmath42.5 . here",
    "we show that these compact galaxies indeed have low ssfrs ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as @xcite point out",
    ", the true sfrs of quiescent galaxies may be even lower as the mid - ir flux density can originate from processes unrelated to ongoing star formation , such as cirrus dust heated by old stellar populations and circumstellar dust .",
    "the uv+ir sfrs derived for quiescent galaxies herein are therefore likely upper limits ( right panels in figure  [ fig : size ] ) , with the effect setting in for 24@xmath8m - derived sfrs with @xmath26@xmath0 - 10 yr@xmath14 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "accounting for the overestimation of the quiescent sfrs by treating the sfrs measured for @xmath26@xmath0 - 10 yr@xmath14 as upper limits will only serve to accentuate the trends between galaxy size and sfr for the overall population .    in the right most panels of figure  [ fig",
    ": size ] , we see a flattening of the galaxy size - mass relation for quiescent galaxies at low stellar masses ( @xmath010@xmath48 m@xmath49 ) , similar to @xcite and @xcite . this is most evident at 0.5@xmath0@xmath1@xmath01.0 , where the stellar mass limits imposed by the structural measurements extend down to 10@xmath50 m@xmath49 .",
    "these low - mass quiescent galaxies tend to have sizes similar to the bulk of the star - forming population at that epoch , as well as slightly higher ssfrs than more massive quenched galaxies .",
    "these results hint at a more gradual quenching of star formation , perhaps due to a depleted gas supply .",
    "these trends are likely not driven by environmental effects : results from @xcite find no significant environmental dependence of the sizes of central and satellite quiescent galaxies at fixed stellar mass at @xmath1@xmath40 .          with the present observations , it is interesting to consider on what galaxy size scale most of the stars in the universe form . in figure  [ fig : sfuniverse ] , the symbol size represents the product of the average ssfr for that bin with the number of galaxies .",
    "a symbol can be small either because there are few galaxies that populate that parameter space and/or because those galaxies are not forming very many new stars on average .",
    "the black line demarcates the 50th percentile , signifying the size scale at which half of the star formation for a given stellar mass occurs .",
    "the grey shaded region then shows the 25th and 75th percentile range , encompassing half of the star formation in the universe .",
    "we see that 50@xmath51 of stars are formed in galaxies with sizes within @xmath20.13 dex from the average star - forming size - mass relation , as shown as the solid blue from @xcite for comparison .",
    "this width of 0.26 dex is of similar order to the @xmath52 intrinsic scatter of the size - mass relation ( see figure 6c in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "most of the stars in the universe are formed in star - forming galaxies with typical sizes .",
    "while we find that amongst the overall galaxy population most of the star formation occurs within a narrow range of sizes , we can further explore if we see any dependence on the star formation rate _ within _ the star - forming population . in the following section",
    ", we isolate these star - forming galaxies based on their rest - frame u - v and v - j colors ( see figure 26 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      when solely selecting actively star - forming galaxies based on their rest - frame colors ( middle panels in figure  [ fig : size ] ) , the dependence of the average ssfr of a galaxy on size is far less pronounced relative to the overall galaxy population ( left panels ) .",
    "to first order , for any given stellar mass , larger star - forming galaxies have the same average ssfr as smaller star - forming galaxies within @xmath00.2 dex .",
    "we start to see deviations from this trend at the highest stellar masses and lowest redshift interval .",
    "this is likely related to the observed flattening in the slope of the star formation sequence towards later times for galaxies more massive than @xmath410@xmath53 m@xmath49 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the correlation between this flattening and srsic index @xcite .",
    "we note that the trends between the size - mass plane and ssfr for star - forming galaxies agree nicely with those at @xmath1=0 presented in @xcite .",
    "ssfr , we find the same general trends as the uv+ir sfr amongst the overall galaxy population : large galaxies have higher ssfrs than smaller galaxies at fixed stellar mass .",
    "similarly , we find the same lower envelope of compact star - forming galaxies with depressed ssfrs . ]    in order to better quantify the dependence of the average star formation rate on galaxy size , we first must remove the well - known trends with stellar mass and redshift ( see the appendix for details ) . figure  [ fig : size_sfr ] presents the residual relation between the average star formation rate and rest - frame 5000  galaxy size for star - forming galaxies only .",
    "the grey - scale demarcates the typical observed 0.3 dex scatter in the star - formation sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the transparency is defined by a gaussian distribution .",
    "if we split the data into quartiles in @xmath54log(sfr ) , taking into account the number of galaxies that go into each data point , we find no significant differences ; the sizes of galaxies in the highest quartile are 0.27@xmath20.47 dex larger than galaxies in the lowest quartile . in other words , we see that the residual sfrs of the majority of galaxies show little to no dependence on galaxy size ( see also fang et al . in prep ) .",
    "using spatially - resolved maps of h@xmath55 for star - forming galaxies at z@xmath41 in the 3d - hst survey , @xcite find that h@xmath55 is enhanced at all radii above the main ridgeline of the log(sfr)-log(m@xmath7 ) plane , and depressed at all radii below .",
    "this suggests that the physical processes driving the rate of star formation acts throughout the entirety of galaxy disks . taking these results at face value with the present analysis ,",
    "this supports the idea that galaxies follow `` parallel - tracks '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see section  [ sec : density ] for further discussion ) .",

    "* ) , as well as potential systematic uncertainties introduced by the stacking methods employed . while results from @xcite demonstrate that the stellar mass density profiles do not appear to depend strongly on any potential color gradients , other studies have found spatial variations in mass - to - light ratios to be important ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we discuss this issue further in section  [ sec : density ] .",
    "we have performed several tests in order to explore if the lack of trend between ( s)sfr and galaxy size is driven by either the relatively large redshift bins or the adopted sfr indicator .",
    "if we assume that the ssfr of any given galaxy is independent of the size , we can use the same parent sample redshift distribution and the well observed average relation between log(sfr)log(m@xmath7 ) to randomly assign each galaxy a size from the @xcite size - mass relation .",
    "we find that we can reproduce all observed trends , shy of the lower envelope of compact fading star - forming galaxies .",
    "the large redshift bins therefore do not effect the conclusions of this paper .",
    "the uv+ir total sfrs probe star formation timescales of order 100 myr .",
    "when instead considering the h@xmath55 star formation rate indicator , which is sensitive to shorter timescales of order 10 myr , we find the same trends amongst star - forming galaxies in figure  [ fig : halpha ] .",
    "for this test , we use the h@xmath55 emission line fluxes from the 3d - hst survey in the two lowest redshift bins and correct for dust attenuation from the best - fit a@xmath56 from the spectral energy distribution . even though this dust correction is somewhat uncertain ( see * ? ? ? * ) , it is likely that we may be underestimating the dust attenuation which could make the trends between galaxy size and ssfr slightly more pronounced .",
    "however , from this test we can conclude that the general independence of star formation rate and galaxy size is likely not sensitive to the timescale on which the star formation rate is probed .",
    "the notable exception to the lack of dependence on ssfr are galaxies with intermediate stellar masses ( log(m@xmath7/m@xmath49)@xmath410.0 - 10.6 ) and compact sizes ( @xmath9@xmath02 kpc ) .",
    "these massive compact galaxies have star formation rates significantly depressed relative to the bulk population of star - forming galaxies .",
    "they may be in the process of fading to join the quiescent population ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "galaxies that quench at later times are expected to have larger sizes because the universe was less dense and therefore gas - rich , dissipative processes were less efficient @xcite .",
    "however , observations at @xmath1@xmath31.5 find that the most recently quenched galaxies are similar , if not more compact , than older quiescent galaxies at the same epoch @xcite .",
    "there is a mixed bag of size measurements at @xmath1@xmath41.5 @xcite , with recently quenched galaxies at @xmath1@xmath41.5 exhibiting a range of sizes , whereas studies at @xmath1@xmath01 find that the most recently quenched galaxies are the largest @xcite .",
    "a trend is emerging : recently quenched galaxies may be more compact at high redshift , whereas they are larger at later times . at @xmath1@xmath31 , we show here that the central density threshold for quenching is higher relative to the already quenched population in figure  [ fig : bestfit_sigma_quenched ] ( shown as greyscale , with the running median in red ) . we therefore see evidence that higher redshift quiescent galaxies are predicted to have significantly higher central densities to quench , which may therefore alleviate some of the tension in the observations between low and higher redshift analyses .",
    "when considering where massive galaxies populate the @xmath94(ssfr)@xmath94(@xmath37 ) plane ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : sigma1_mass ] ) , we see that they tend to have the densest central concentrations of stellar mass .",
    "it is important to note however , that the trend itself between central density and ssfr does not vary strongly with stellar mass at a given epoch . in other words , while different stellar mass regimes tend to populate the upper and lower end of this relation , it is the entire relation itself that evolves with redshift .",
    "the stellar mass dependence of this quenching threshold in central density observed by @xcite at @xmath1=0 may be explained in part by more massive galaxies having formed earlier in the universe @xcite .",
    "there is a thorough discussion of this downsizing in quenching in @xcite . as more massive dark",
    "matter halos will tend to cross a threshold halo mass for viral shock heating earlier in the universe , halo quenching will occur preferentially in more massive galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , violent disk instabilities will also have a natural downsizing , which @xcite argue is the result of higher gas fractions in lower mass galaxies .",
    "whether galaxies quenches fast through , e.g. , violent disk instabilities , or slow through halo quenching , more massive galaxies will tend to cross this quenching threshold earlier in time . in figures  [ fig : bestfit_sigma_char ] and [ fig : bestfit_sigma_quenched ] , we show that the quenching threshold differs from the characteristic turnover value .",
    "this difference may either imply that galaxies keep growing their centers after star formation starts actively diminishing . or , that there is significant scatter in this quenching threshold , where galaxies with central densities in between the characteristic turnover and the quenching threshold have an intermediate probability of being quenched .",
    "although we observe that a high central density appears to predict quiescence on average , we caution that this does not necessarily imply causation .",
    "@xcite propose instead that galaxies quench their star formation according to empirical probabilistic laws that depend solely on the total mass of the galaxy , not on the surface mass density or size .",
    "with their simple model they can broadly reproduce all of the trends between galaxy structure and ssfr that we observe here , including the evolving quenching threshold .",
    "@xcite argue that because galaxies form their stars inside - out and passive galaxies will form them at earlier epochs ( higher redshifts ) , passive galaxies will always have smaller sizes than their star - forming counterparts of the same stellar mass at any given redshift . determining the cause of quenching is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "but we note that even without causation , we show that the high central density holds a unique predictive power in identifying the population of galaxies that , on average , will be quiescent .",
    "the aim of this paper is to connect rest - frame optical measurements of the size - mass and density - mass relations with robust measurements of the total specific sfrs from a purely empirical standpoint .",
    "we can thereby connect galaxy structure and star formation to better understand the observed bimodal distribution of galaxies across cosmic time and the quenching of star formation .",
    "this current study extends the original work by @xcite on a smaller field that included 1155 galaxies at 0.2@xmath0@xmath1@xmath03.5 to now consider a mass - complete sample of 27,893 galaxies at 0.5@xmath0@xmath1@xmath02.5 .",

    "the well known correlations between stellar mass and star formation rate and galaxy size , we show that the majority of star - forming galaxies show no dependence of their star formation rates on galaxy size .",
    "there exists a small population of compact intermediate mass ( log(m@xmath7/m@xmath49)=10 - 10.6 ) star - forming galaxies who exhibit significant depressions of up to 0.5 dex in log(ssfr ) .",

    "we find that the independence of star formation rate on galaxy size is not sensitive to the timescale on which the star formation rate is probed , with dust - corrected h@xmath55 ssfrs yielding similar trends .",
    "we confirm earlier studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , showing that the central stellar density is a key parameter connecting galaxy morphology and star formation histories : galaxies with high central densities are red and have increasingly lower ssfrs , whereas galaxies with low central densities are blue and have a roughly constant ( higher ) ssfrs at a given redshift interval",
    "we use a broken power - law to parameterize the correlation between log(ssfr ) and central density , log(@xmath37 ) , showing remarkably little scatter between the average measurements .",
    "we find strong evolution in the central density threshold for quenching , as defined by both a constant and evolving threshold in ssfr , decreasing by @xmath30.5 dex from @xmath1@xmath42 to @xmath1@xmath40.7 .",

    "we show that neither a high @xmath5 nor a compact galaxy size will uniquely predict quiescence , whereas a threshold in central density ( or velocity ) may be a more robust and unique observable signature when considering the overall galaxy population . however , we emphasize that correlations between structure and star formation do not prove a causal effect .",
    "for example , it remains to be seen whether small scale structure ( at the scale of the stars ) or large scale parameters ( the scale of the dark matter halo ) dominate the physical processes which quench galaxies . while we have presented the average global trends of the ssfr with structural parameters ( @xmath9 , @xmath5 , @xmath57 , @xmath37 , and @xmath64 ) amongst a mass - complete sample of galaxies using high resolution _",
