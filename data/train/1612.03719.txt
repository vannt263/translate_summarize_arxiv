    "wolf - rayet central stars are hydrogen deficient central stars of planetary nebulae which exhibit in their spectra strong emission lines of helium , carbon and oxygen . because their spectra resemble those of massive wc stars , they are called [ wc ] stars , with brackets to distinguish them from their massive counterparts . in spite of spectral similarities and comparable chemical composition , the formation of the low - mass [ wc ] stars is completely different from the formation of the massive wc stars .",
    "stellar evolutionary models accounting for simultaneous burning and mixing explain the formation of a [ wc ] star by the occurrence of a thermal pulse ( tp ) at the very end or after the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase of a h - normal low - mass star .",
    "these models predict a hydrogen - deficient surface composition with carbon enriched up to @xmath0 after a late or very late tp ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "* herwig 2001 ) ) . only in the case of a very late tp ( vltp ) a supersolar nitrogen abundance of about @xmath1",
    "is expected , but without any remaining hydrogen .",
    "thus low - mass central stars with wn - like surface abundances are theoretically not expected .",
    "the cs pb8 was classified as [ wc5 - 6 ] by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* acker & neiner ( 2003 ) ) based on a low - resolution spectrum . a spectral analysis based on a high resolution spectrum , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* todt et al .  ( 2010 ) ) revealed that this object has a stellar temperature of about @xmath2kk and an unusual composition with he : h : c : n : o=55:40:1:1:1 by mass and resembles spectroscopically a massive wn / c star .",
    "due to its unknown distance , also @xmath3 is unknown , so whether this star is a true [ wn / c ] cs can only be inferred indirectly .    the nebula analysis by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* garca - rojas ( 2009 ) ) yield values for @xmath4 and @xmath5 which are typical for young pne , as well as the small @xmath6km / s . regarding the luminosity distance",
    ", one finds that for a cspn with @xmath7 , pb8 would be at a distance of 4.2kpc and at a height of 300pc above the galactic plane , whereas a massive wr star would have at least @xmath8 , and so at least a distance of 24kpc and a height of 1.7kpc above the galactic plane .",
    "this is a rather untypical location for a massive wr star .",
    "so , pb8 is indeed a cspn .",
    "we also considered the possibility that pb8 may be a binary .",
    "although this can not be excluded completely , it is rather unlikely as there were no shifts of radial velocities of spectral lines detected ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( mndez 1989 ) ) and the nebula appears spherically symmetric , also in velocity space .      the first `` pure '' [ wn ]",
    "was discovered by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* miszalski et al .  ( 2012 ) ) .",
    "their spectral analysis based on an optical spectrum revealed that ic4663 is an almost hydrogen - free ( @xmath9 by mass ) [ wn ] star , whose wind consists to 95% of helium with only 0.8% nitrogen .",
    "interestingly it is of early spectral subtype ( [ wn3 ] ) with a temperature of about 140kk and a relatively low mass - loss rate of about @xmath10 .",
    "* miszalski et al .  ( 2012 ) ) showed that if ic  4663 were a massive wn star it would be at an implausible distance of 58kpc and more than 8kpc below the galactic plane .",
    "moreover , they discovered an agb halo around ic  4663 , proving it is a cspn .",
    "* depew et al . ( 2011 ) ) mentioned the cs of abell48 , but it was unclear whether this is really a cspn and not a massive wn star ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wachter et al . 2010 ) classified it as wn6 ) .",
    "the cs abell48 was found to have a helium - rich ( 85% ) wind with about 10% hydrogen , and a nitrogen abundance of about @xmath11 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* todt et al .  2013 ) , see fig ,  [ fig : abell48 ] ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* frew et al .  2014 ) ) . from the nebula analysis ( line ratios of sii and h@xmath12 , as in (",
    "* riesgo - torado & lpez 2002 ) ) it was concluded that abell48 is indeed a cspn .",
    "this is also consistent with the measured extinction and its significant proper motion - abell48 is a runaway .",
    "the cs has a mass - loss rate of @xmath13 and a temperature of about 70kk .",
    "its spectral subtype is [ wn5 ] .",
    "the earliest claim for the discovery of a [ wn ] central star was by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* morgan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ) , who observed the highly reddened ( @xmath14 ) object pmr5 , which shows a wn spectrum ( subtype wn6 ) and a round nebula . however , it is not clear , whether this is a pn or ring nebula around a massive wr star .",
    "while the electron density is consistent with a pn , the expansion velocity of @xmath15km / s is rather unusual for a pn , but typical for a ring nebula .",
    "moreover , the luminosity distance is consistent with a massive wr star . for a typical cspn luminosity of @xmath7 pmr5",
    "would be located at a distance of 0.5kpc and at a height of 6pc above the galactic plane , while for a typical luminosity of a massive wn star pmr5 would be at 2.9kpc away and 35pc above the galactic plane .",
    "hence , both locations are consistent with the corresponding type of star . however , a reddening of @xmath16mag is rather untypical for a distance of only 500pc .",
    "a spectral analysis based on the published spectrum revealed a chemical composition of a typical wnh star , but with a large mass fraction of n ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "overall , chemistry and @xmath18 point to a massive wn star with a ring nebula .",
    "so far , all of the confirmed [ wn ] stars are of earlier spectral subtypes .",
    "it may be that late [ wn ] stars have escaped detection because of their narrower stellar lines which can be confused with nebular emission lines , especially at low spectral resolution .",
    "moreover , also some h - rich css show emission lines , e.g. , ngc6543 , and are therefore classified as of wr / of spectral type ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "* crowther & walborn 2011 ) ) , is often blended with the nebular emission .",
    "thus a high spectral resolution is also needed to tell wn type central stars from of type central stars .",
    "the evolutionary channel by which [ wn ] stars are formed is unclear .",
    "none of the recent late tp scenarios predicts the observed surface compositions of pb8 , ic4663 , and abell48 .",
    "it was speculated whether these objects belong to an alternative evolutionary sequence [ wn ] @xmath20 o(he ) ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* miszalski et al .  2012 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* werner 2012 ) ) or that [ wn ] stars are o(he ) stars with higher masses ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* reindl et al .  2014 ) ) , evolving from rcb or sdo(he ) stars , which might be merger products of non - da wds .",
    "however , the merger scenario seems to be rather unlikely due to the long timescales involved , which are incompatible with the observed low ages of the pne of the [ wn ] stars .",
    "moreover , pb8 and abell48 also contain hydrogen while the assumed progenitors are h - free .",
    "note that the `` classical '' born - again scenario by ( * ? ? ?",
