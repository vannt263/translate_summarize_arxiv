    "surveys for young stars in molecular clouds have shown that most stars do not form in isolation , but in aggregates ranging from the widely dispersed groups of stars found in the taurus cloud , to the clusters found in orion , and ultimately to the `` superclusters '' such as ngc3603 .",
    "there is an enormous range in the richness of these stellar groups / clusters , from several stars in taurus to more than a thousand stars in ngc3603 , all within regions of a few cubic parsecs . to understand this enormous range in richness and the dependence of the richness on the molecular gas environment ,",
    "we have undertaken a comparative study of both the molecular and stellar components of a sample of 31 clusters within 1 kpc of the sun .",
    "we have obtained maps of the molecular gas surrounding the two young stellar clusters in @xmath0co 10 and c@xmath1o 10 at 45@xmath2 resolution with the fcrao 14 m telescope .",
    "these observations were followed up with higher resolution ( 30@xmath2 ) c@xmath1o 21 on - the - fly ( otf ) maps , obtained at the heinrich hertz telescope ( hht ) , operated by the submillimeter telescope observatory ( smto ) .",
    "figure 1 shows contours of the c@xmath1o 21 emission overlaid on a 2mass k - band image .",
    "the dense gas traced by the c@xmath1o seems to trace the ring structure apparent in the stellar component of monr2 .",
    "the gas around ggd12 - 15 appears elongated in the east - west direction .",
    "the table below compares the gas and stellar properties of the two clusters .",
    "the stellar properties are taken from carpenter ( 2000 ) , while the gas properties are derived from our c@xmath1o observations .",
    "figure 2 shows maps of the c@xmath1o line width , centered on the same position as fig .  1 .",
    "the ring - like morphology seen in the k - band image of monr2 can also be clearly seen in the line - width map .",
    "the horizontal line apparent at a dec offset @xmath3 + 100@xmath2 is an artifact due to lower signal  noise ratio in this region of the map .",
    "there is also a region of low line - width north - east of the stellar cluster .",
    "it is harder to pick out any structure in the noisier line - width map of ggd12 - 15 , but it does appear to increase towards the centre ."

    "<S> we have begun a survey of the molecular gas surrounding 31 young clusters in order to investigate the link between environment and the resulting cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we present here a preliminary comparison of two clusters in our sample : ggd12 - 15 and mon r2 . since both clusters are located in the monr2 molecular cloud at a distance of 830 pc ( carpenter 2000 ) , observational biases due to differing sensitivities and angular resolutions are avoided . </S>"
