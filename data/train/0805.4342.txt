    "quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) are thought to originate in the inner accretion disk of a black hole or neutron star in an x - ray binary ( xrb ) system @xcite .",
    "consequently , qpos have been used in galactic xrbs to introduce important constraints on the masses of the central black holes of these systems .",
    "previous work has revealed that agn and xrbs are alike : noise power spectra have shown that similar physical processes may be underlying the x - ray variability in both @xcite . taking this resemblance into account and assuming that accretion onto a stellar - mass black hole is comparable to accretion onto a supermassive black hole",
    ", one would expect some agn to exhibit qpos similar to those observed in xrbs . in supermassive black holes ( @xmath5-@xmath6 m@xmath2 )",
    ", these qpos would be at much lower frequencies than those we find in stellar - mass black holes ( @xmath7 10 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "low frequency quasi - periods ( lf qpos ) in xrbs range from 50 mhz to 30 hz ; scaling from a @xmath8 hz qpo in a 10 @xmath9 xrb , a lf qpo in an agn would occur on timescales of days to months @xcite , too long to be detectable for the agn in our sample . on the other hand , high frequency qpos ( hf qpos ) in xrbs",
    "have values of @xmath10 100 hz and assuming a 1/@xmath11 scaling of frequencies , @xmath12 hz @xcite , corresponding to timescales greater than 400s for agn .    while this parallel between agn and xrbs seems promising , no claim of an x - ray quasi - period in an agn has been found to be statistically robust .",
    "@xcite remark that a major source of false detections arise from assuming an inappropriate background noise power spectrum .",
    "x - ray variations of agn have intrinsically red noise power spectra ( i.e. the power spectra have a continuum resembling a power law with a steep slope ; press 1978 ) , however many purported qpos in agn are compared against an assumed background of white noise ( i.e. poisson photon noise or a flat spectrum ) . for example , in a @xmath75 day asca observation of iras 18325 - 5926 the significance of the candidate periodicity was estimated with white noise @xcite . after including red noise in the periodogram fitting , @xcite found that the candidate periodicity was no longer significant at the 95@xmath13 level . @xcite also claimed high ( @xmath14 ) significance peaks in ngc 4151 , however , after fitting red noise and poisson photon noise components of the spectrum @xcite showed that the significances of the qpos fell below the 95@xmath13 confidence level .",
    "it is also difficult to constrain the significance of possible qpos due to power spectra effects @xcite .",
    "exosat data of ngc 5548 were reported to have a significant period @xcite , but @xcite later showed that the significance of the candidate qpo was lower than previously reported once the uncertainties in modeling the spectrum were taken into consideration .",
    "this lack of statistically significant evidence for qpos in agn has led to questions of whether existing x - ray observations of agn are sensitive enough to detect qpos even if they are present @xcite .",
    "here we use a different technique to search for significant periodic structures in the time variability data that have been collected for agns with xmm - newton .",
    "we use a wavelet transform technique , which can have certain advantages relative to periodograms and fourier power spectra , the methods that have previously dominated the literature .",
    "the wavelet technique , which has become widely used in other branches of science , is particularly useful in identifying signals where the period or its amplitude changes with time .",
    "this technique is applied to the xmm - newton data from bright 10 agns , with special care taken to properly treat the noise characteristics and error analysis , and we find a candidate 3.3 ks quasi - period in 3c 273 .    in section 2 , we present our observations and data reduction steps . in section 3",
    ", we provide an overview of the two wavelet techniques used in our analysis : the continuous wavelet transform and the cross - wavelet transform .",
    "the results of these two techniques as well as significance tests are presented .",
    "we also discuss structure function analysis for the agn in our sample . in section 4",
    "we argue that this 3.3 ks quasi - period in 3c 273 is consistent with what we would expect from oscillations in the accretion disk around the supermassive black hole based on current black hole mass estimates .",
    "the 10 agn in our sample were selected because they are bright and have _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn camera observations which exceed 30 kiloseconds ( ks ) . in total",
    ", we have 19 observations and each observation s i d , date , length , and average counts are listed in table  [ obslog ] .",
    "all observations are in the energy range 0.75 to 10 kev and most were taken in small window mode , which has a readout time of 6 milliseconds ( ms ) .",
    "the only exception is ngc 4151 observation i d ( obs .",
    "i d ) : 0112830201 , which was taken in full frame mode with a readout time of 73.4 ms .",
    "observation data files ( odfs ) were obtained from the on - line _ xmm - newton _ science archive and later reduced with the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis software ( sas , v. 7.0.0 , 6.1.0 , 5.4.1 ) .",
    "source light curves , with 5 s bins , were extracted for a circular region centered on the source ( @xmath720@xmath15@xmath15 ) .",
    "background light curves were obtained from a nearby rectangular source - free region and subtracted from the source light curves .",
    "these rectangular background regions were larger than the source regions and were accordingly scaled down . due to strong flaring , the last few kiloseconds of data are excluded from most observations .",
    "the count rates for the target sources are orders of magnitude greater than the background count rate in the detection cell , so a rise in the background is unimportant .",
    "we removed these last few kiloseconds of data from the data stream just to be very cautious .",
    "we note that in the observation of 3c 273 with the claimed detection , including the periods with flaring does not change our results .",
    "some of the observations in our sample are affected by pile - up .",
    "pile - up occurs when more than one x - ray photon arrives in a pixel before the pixel is read out by the ccd , making it difficult to distinguish one high energy photon from two lower energy photons .",
    "pile - up can also occur when photons striking adjacent pixels are confused with a single photon that deposits charge in more than one pixel .",
    "depending on how many pixels are involved , this is called a single- , double- , triple- , or quadruple- pixel event .",
    "the sas task epatplot measures the pile - up in an observation and the results for our target with the highest count rate , mkn 421 ( table 1 ) , are shown in figure  [ epatplot ] .",
    "when we compare the expected fractions of pixel events ( solid lines ) with those actually measured in the data ( histograms ) for the range 0.75 to 10 kev we see that a larger than expected fraction of double events ( third histogram from top , dark blue in electronic edition ) is measured as well as a larger fraction of triple and quadruple events ( bottom two histograms ) , although to a lesser degree , while single events ( second histogram from top ) are lower than expected , indicating the presence of pile - up .",
    "pile - up leads to a general reduction in the mean count rate as well as a reduction in the magnitude of variations .",
    "we will explore the influence of pile - up on our data in more detail when we discuss structure functions in section  [ sfpileupsection ] .",
    "the continuous wavelet transform ( cwt ) is the inner product of a dilated and translated mother wavelet and a time series @xmath16 , the idea being that the wavelet is applied as a band - pass filter to the time - series .",
    "the continuous wavelet transform maps the power of a particular frequency ( i.e. dilation ) at different times in translation - dilation space , giving an expansion of the signal in both time and frequency .",
    "hence , the continuous wavelet transform not only tells us which frequencies exist in the signal , but also when they exist , allowing us to see whether a timescale varies in time .",
    "this is the wavelet technique s advantage over fourier transforms in detecting quasi - periods .",
    "in addition , the fourier transform is not suited for detecting quasi - periods since non - periodic outbursts will spread power across the spectrum and windowing will cause power to appear at low frequencies , potentially obscuring quasi - periodic signals .    throughout this paper , we follow @xcite and @xcite and references within . in previous studies",
    "@xcite we have found the morlet wavelet @xmath17 with @xmath18 to be an excellent choice .",
    "the value of @xmath19 is a satisfactory compromise between a value small - enough that we have good resolution of temporal structures , and large - enough that the admissibility condition is satisfied , at least to machine accuracy @xcite .",
    "the wavelet , being continuous and complex , permits a rendering in transform space that highlights temporally localized , periodic activity  oscillatory behavior in the real part and a smooth distribution of power in the modulus  and being progressive ( zero power at negative frequency ) , is optimal for the study of causal signals .",
    "we have deliberately avoided any form of weighting , such as that introduced by @xcite to allow for uneven sampling , or @xcite to rescale within the cone of influence , in order to facilitate our interpretation of the cross wavelet , and to allow the use of existing methods of significance analysis .    from this mother wavelet",
    ", we generate a set of translated ( @xmath20 ) and dilated ( @xmath21 ) wavelets @xmath22 and we then take the inner product with the signal @xmath23 to obtain the wavelet coefficients @xmath24 the wavelet coefficients are later mapped in wavelet space which has as coordinates translation and dilation , and so periodic behavior shows up as a pattern over all translations at a specific dilation .    by way of example , figure  [ sinecwt ] shows the real part and the power of the continuous wavelet transform ( second and bottom panel , respectively ) for a sinusoidal signal of varying frequency ( top panel ) .",
    "here , the real part of the transform shows oscillatory behavior corresponding to the two periodicities of the sinusoidal signal at dilations of 3s and 6s with a break in translation at 50s corresponding to the time where the change in frequency occurs .",
    "the bottom panel in figure  [ sinecwt ] shows that the power of the continuous wavelet transform is concentrated at these two frequencies as well .",
    "the hatched area in both panels of figure  [ sinecwt ] represents the cone of influence : the region where edge effects become important .",
    "it arises because discontinuities at the beginning and end of a finite time series result in a decrease in the wavelet coefficient power .",
    "also shown in the header of figure  [ sinecwt ] are the number of dilations used ( @xmath25 ) and the ranges of dilations explored .",
    "we discuss @xmath26 and the normalization of figure  [ sinecwt ] in the following section .",
    "significance tests can be created for the continuous wavelet transform and here we follow @xcite . first , one compares the wavelet power with that of an appropriate background spectrum .",
    "we use the univariate lag-1 auto - regressive [ ar(1 ) ] process given by @xmath27 where @xmath26 is the assumed lag-1 autocorrelation and @xmath28 is a random deviate taken from white noise . note that @xmath29 gives a white noise process . throughout this paper , we will use `` white noise '' to refer to an ar(1 ) process with @xmath29 .",
    "red noise is sometimes used to refer to noise with @xmath30 , however , throughout this paper we apply the term to any non - zero @xmath26 .",
    "the normalized discrete fourier power spectrum of this process is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the associated fourier period for a scale @xmath33 .",
    "we use the above two equations to model a white noise or red noise spectrum .",
    "the global wavelet power spectrum ( gwps ) is obtained by averaging in time @xmath34 here , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the indices of the initial and final translations @xmath37 outside of the cone of influence at a given scale @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath38 is the number of translations @xmath37 outside the cone of influence at that scale . assuming a background spectrum given by eqn .",
    "[ fouriereqn ] we estimate the autocorrelation coefficient ( @xmath26 ) by calculating the lag-1 and lag-2 autocorrelations , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the autocorrelation coefficient is then estimated as @xmath41 .",
    "the background spectrum @xmath42 then allows us to compute the confidence levels .",
    "it is assumed that the time series has a mean power spectrum given by eqn .",
    "[ fouriereqn ] and so if a peak in the wavelet power spectrum is significantly above this background spectrum , then the peak can be assumed to be a true feature .",
    "if the values in the time series @xmath16 are normally distributed , we expect the wavelet power @xmath43 to be @xmath44 distributed with two degrees of freedom ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the square of a normally distributed variable is @xmath44 distributed with one degree of freedom and the second degree of freedom comes from the fact that both the real and imaginary parts of the complex @xmath46 are normally distributed .",
    "for example , to determine the 95@xmath13 confidence level , one multiplies the background spectrum ( eqn .",
    "[ fouriereqn ] ) by the 95th percentile value for @xmath47 . in figure  [ sinegwps ]",
    "we show the gwps of a time series along with 99@xmath13 and 95@xmath13 confidence level for a red noise process and 99@xmath13 confidence level for a white noise process .",
    "the distribution for the local wavelet power spectrum is @xmath48 where the arrow means  distributed as , \" @xmath49 is the variance , and @xmath50 is the number of degrees of freedom , which is two here .",
    "the indices on the scale @xmath21 are @xmath51=1,2, ... ,@xmath52 where @xmath52 is the number of scales , and the indices on the translation @xmath20 are @xmath53=1,2, ... ,@xmath54 .",
    "we evaluate this equation at each scale to get 95@xmath13 confidence contour lines and in this paper our continuous transforms are normalized to the 95@xmath13 confidence level for the corresponding red noise process .",
    "doing this allows one to see the strength of the wavelet coefficients relative to the 95@xmath13 confidence level of a red noise process .",
    "although the continuous wavelet transform is useful in examining how a time series varies in time and scale , it does not tell us how the time series varies in dilation over a range of scales when assigning a characteristic timescale .",
    "since a quasi - periodic signal has no unique dilation we use the cross - wavelet transform ( xwt ) which filters out noise and reveals the qpo more clearly . here",
    "we use the xwt introduced by @xcite .    after the continuous transform identifies that a periodic pattern exists in the data , the dilation that characterizes this period is obtained from the global wavelet power spectrum and is used to create a sinusoidal mock signal .",
    "the continuous wavelet transform coefficients of the data signal @xmath55 are then multiplied by the complex conjugate of the continuous transform coefficients of a mock signal @xmath56 .",
    "the results are mapped out in wavelet space and analyzed for a correlation .",
    "the cross - wavelet transform takes the form @xmath57 where the continuous wavelet coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 are given by equation  [ coefficients ] .",
    "figure  [ sinecross ] shows the cross - wavelet for the same sinusoidal signal of varying frequency used in figure  [ sinecwt ] .",
    "the mock signal was calculated using the 6s period found in the wavelet power spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ sinegwps ] ) and as the concentrations in the real and power panels of figure  [ sinecross ] show , the cross - wavelet finds that this 6s period exists in the first half of the time series , illustrating the cross - wavelet s ability to highlight a qpo",
    ".    the reader may refer to @xcite for a full review of the cross - wavelet technique used here .      since the global wavelet power spectrum compares the observed signal to expected levels of red noise and white noise , we created structure functions ( sfs ) for each of our observations to see which noise process dominates the signal at different times .",
    "a structure function calculates the mean deviation of data points , providing an alternate method of quantifying time variations .",
    "here we use a structure function of the first - order @xcite : @xmath60^{2}>\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the flux at time @xmath61 and @xmath62 is a time lag . the slope @xmath26 of the sf curve in @xmath63 space depends on the noise processes underlying the signal , giving us an indication of the nature of the process of variation .",
    "if @xmath30 red noise dominates , and for flatter slopes of @xmath29 poisson photon noise is significant .",
    "a plateau at short time lag is due to measurement noise .",
    "the transition from plateau to power - law in the structure function curve determines where the dominant underlying noise process changes in the object .",
    "the point of turnover from power - law to plateau at longer time lags corresponds to a maximum characteristic timescale .",
    "we measure the presence of pile - up in our observations by using the sas task epatplot and find that the majority of our sources show varying degrees of pile - up . for example , as previously shown in section  [ obssection ] , mkn 421 obs .",
    "i d : 0099280101 has a modest amount of pile - up ( see figure  [ epatplot ] ) . in the structure function of this observation (",
    "left panel , figure  [ structpileup ] ) , the flat portion of the structure function curve should have a value of @xmath64 , which corresponds to the poisson photon noise inherent in the photon statistics .",
    "however , here it falls below the poisson photon noise level . to remove the pile - up",
    "we exclude the central core of the source in the event file since pile - up is more likely to occur here . for this subtracted data",
    ", the epatplot output indicates that there is no pile - up and the sf curve is then at the expected value for poisson photon noise ( right panel , figure  [ structpileup ] ) .",
    "pile - up affects the sf because it lowers the overall count rate and thereby poisson photon noise is underreported .",
    "we correct for pile - up in the rest of our data by adding a fixed value to @xmath65 , moving the flat part of the structure function curve up to 1 .",
    "all of our observations had less than 5@xmath13 pile - up except for pks 2155 - 304 obs .",
    "i d 124930301 ( 6.5@xmath13 ) and both observations of mkn 421 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "overall , the percentage of pile - up in our sample increases with the number of counts except for ngc 4151 obs .",
    "i d 112830201 which is 5@xmath13 piled - up and has an average of only 25 counts .        of the observations that we analyzed ,",
    "only one showed a quasi - period of interest ( at 3.3 ksec ) , and this occurred in an observation of 3c 273 ( i d 126700301 ) .",
    "the continuous wavelet transform result for this observation is shown in figure  [ 3ccwt ] with the quasi - period circled in the real and power plots ( second and third panel , respectively ) .",
    "one can see that the quasi - period appears in the last two - thirds of the observation . in the real plot , the concentrations match up with peaks in the light curve , and the power is concentrated at @xmath67 s. the wavelet is sampled with 220 dilations ( @xmath68 ) ranging between @xmath69 s and @xmath70 s. we note that the data in figure  [ 3ccwt ] are binned from 5 s to 100 s for clarity and that we only show the first 56 ks due to background flaring at the end of the observation .",
    "we note that including the periods with background flaring does not change our results .",
    "the @xmath26 found from autocorrelation analysis for the unbinned data is 0.14 and this value is used to reach the conclusions in this paper .",
    "the 3.3 ks quasi - period is also evident in the global wavelet power spectrum ( gwps , figure  [ 3cgwps ] ) , which is calculated by summing up the wavelet power spectra at all times . in searching for quasi - periodic behavior we excluded time scales above 25@xmath13 of the time series length , where ,",
    "using spectral methods , too few periods to provide a convincing result would be present , and where the cone of influence becomes important for the wavelet coefficients . on short time",
    "scales , experience has shown that sources often exhibit a broad distribution of power , with local maxima not well - separated from the mean power level .",
    "we selected a lower bound for our search , by visual identification of such behavior in the gwps , in conjunction with a concomitant change in behavior of the sf .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ 3cgwps ] is the power spectrum of the signal , which is compared to the power spectrum of white and red noise random processes ( broken lines ) .",
    "one can see that the 3.3 ks detection exceeds the expected levels of white and red noise at the 99@xmath13 significance level , i.e. the probability of the detection is higher than 99@xmath13 of the noise random processes ( the significance of this signal is 99.979@xmath13 relative to red noise with @xmath71 ) .",
    "the origins of the white and red noise power spectra were discussed in section  [ sigtestsection ] .",
    "the cross - wavelet analysis for 3c 273 ( fig .",
    "[ 3ccross ] ) supports the conclusion that a period of  3.3 ks is indeed present . here",
    ", the xwt ( see section  [ xwtsection ] ) compares a mock sinusoidal signal with a period of 3282 s with the 3c 273 light curve .",
    "the concentration in the cross - wavelet transform shows that the 3.3 ks signal is present throughout the observation .",
    "as one can see , by comparing the crosswavelet signals in juxtaposed bands , the 3.3 ks periodicity can be traced over the entire interval . in the cwt ( figure  [ 3ccwt ] )",
    "the 3.3 ks signal is particularly strong at late times , and so , due to the limited dynamic range of the rendering , is not evident early in the time interval in that figure .",
    "this periodicity is not detected in the other three observations of this object . in the 58 ks ( obs .",
    "i d 159960101 ) and 60 ks ( obs .",
    "i d 126700801 ) observations of 3c 273 , there is a signal at 5000s , but it does not rise above the 99@xmath13 red noise confidence level ( fig .",
    "[ gwpsall1 ] ) .",
    "we note that a fourier analysis of 3c 273 yielded a feature at 3.3 ks , but with a lower significance ( @xmath72 3@xmath73 ) than is found with the wavelet technique .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations in order to estimate the probability that the wavelet technique would claim a spurious detection .",
    "as a baseline , we created one thousand simulated light curves for poisson photon noise ( fig .",
    "11 ) to represent random observational errors i.e. photon counting statistics .",
    "the simulated light curves were 56 ks long with 5 s intervals and we multiplied the mean deviate @xmath28 by 40 to produce an average spread in the y - axis of 40 counts to resemble the 3c 273 light curve .",
    "most of the false detections occur at timescales less than 2000s which corresponds to 3.6 @xmath13 the length of the observation and supports our earlier point that one can select the lower limit to search for periodicities by visual identification of broad distributions of power on short time scales in the gwps . on average ,",
    "the wavelet technique claims a detection ( at or above the significance level reported by the wavelet analysis for 3c 273 ) 0.4@xmath13 of the time ( fig .",
    "[ hist ] ) .",
    "the monte carlo simulations suggest a significantly higher rate of false detections than is implied by the statistics based on the gwps . however , they are consistent with the latter estimates _ within the margin of error _ , given that only 1000 realizations of a time series were generated .",
    "better simulation statistics could be achieved by increasing the number of time series realizations by several orders of magnitude , but devoting time and resources to this is not warranted .",
    "visual inspection of the simulated light curves reveals that they differ qualitatively from the actual time series : a better correspondence can be achieved with the addition of randomly distributed gaussian - profile bursts of fixed , small amplitude .",
    "evidently , the process under study is not strictly a stationary , first order one , and the formal statistical measures of significance should be regarded as only indicative of the high likelihood of a quasi - periodic phenomenon in this source .",
    "a more detailed analysis , allowing for nonstationary processes , is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "while we have performed 19 independent experiments and found only 1 detection we point out that of our 19 data sets only 7 have average counts ( table 1 ) equal to or more than the observation in which we find the qpo .",
    "one can not expect to see with equal likelihood , a periodicity of equal strength in these weaker agn .",
    "we note that independently , the xwt finds evidence for power throughout the observation at 3.3 ks ( fig .",
    "we measured the 3.3 ks signal strength across the time series from the power plot of figure 8 .",
    "the power of the 3.3 ks signal is @xmath7 4000 times stronger than shorter and longer dilations , illustrating that the 3.3 ks period is well - constrained .",
    "we also ran the xwt on this time series with analyzing signals of 2.3 ks and 4.3 ks .",
    "the average power of these signals is @xmath7 2 times less than the average power of the 3.3 ks signal .",
    "this demonstrates that the xwt is picking out a well - defined , persistent signal , and will not misleadingly suggest a signal where there is none .",
    "we did not find any significant detections for the other nine agn in our sample .",
    "no features had significances that exceeded the 99@xmath13 confidence levels for both white noise and red noise processes ( see figs .  [ gwpsall1 ] ,  [ gwpsall2 ] ) and appeared at either too short ( i.e. at timescales shorter than 3.6@xmath13 the length of the observation ) or too long ( i.e. at timescales greater than half the length of the observation ) a timescale .",
    "some of the agn in our sample have been studied before and previous reports of qpos exist in the literature .",
    "we will discuss those results in more detail in section  [ discussionprevious ] .",
    "after correcting for pile - up , we subtract a constant level corresponding to poisson photon noise from the structure functions ( figures  [ sfminus1 ] ,  [ sfminus2 ] ) .",

    "the observation with the 3.3 ks quasi - period ( upper left , figure  [ sfminus1 ] ) is dominated by whitish noise around 3000s , as inferred from its flat slope ; however , the sf is unsuited to quantifying the autocorrelation coefficient precisely .",

    "there are several mass estimates for 3c 273 obtained from different methods .",
    "one method is reverberation mapping whereby one uses the time lag of the emission - line light curve with respect to the continuum light curve to determine the light crossing size of the broad line region ( blr ) and then assumes keplerian conditions in the broad line region gas motion ( i.e. @xmath74 ) @xcite .",

    "these numbers agree with the @xcite mass estimate of @xmath85 m@xmath2 . however , these masses are substantially lower than those expected for supermassive black holes .",

    "these modes are the most relevant observationally since they appear to occupy the largest area of the disk and hence should be the most observable trapped modes @xcite .",
