    "after the discovery of the pulsating x - ray sources ( giacconi et al . 1971 ; tananbaum et al . 1972 ) , a huge number of observational and theoretical studies of x - ray binary pulsars ( xbps ) have been published .",
    "the basic concept of x - ray pulsars has been understood in a quite early stage of these studies ; that is , the periodical x - ray pulsation is considered to be originated from accreting magnetized neutron stars ( theoretically , pringle & rees 1972 ; lamb et al .",
    "1973 ; observationally , white et al . 1983",
    "; nagase 1989 ; bildsten et al .",
    "1997 ) .    in the standard model of x - ray pulsars ,",
    "the x - ray source is a rotating neutron star ( ns ) with a binary companion which feeds accretion matter via roche lobe overflow or stellar wind .",
    "if the ns has a strong magnetic field ( @xmath1 ) , the accreting matter eventually can not accrete onto ns surface across the magnetic field lines .",
    "rather accreting matter is trapped to the magnetic field and constrained to follow the field lines , and near the stellar surface , it forms a funnel - like flow onto the magnetic poles ( e.g. pringle & rees 1972 , basko & sunyaev 1976 ) .",
    "consequently , the accreting matter is concentrated near the polar caps and emits high - energy radiation as the x - ray photons .",
    "since generally the magnetic axis and the rotational axis are misaligned , these x - ray photons from the poles are observed as periodic pulsations ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ; white et al . 1983",
    "; nagase 1989 ; bildsten et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the basic model of x - ray pulsars has already been obtained .",
    "although the detailed investigations of x - ray sources in these systems are still difficult since the observational method of xbps is limited in space experiments , the sample number of xbps increase significantly in these days , thanks to recent development of space experiments . hence , even though what we can know from a single observation is less , we can distill some hints of x - ray source properties by statistical analysis of observed x - ray pulsars ( bulik et al .",
    "2003 ; raguzova & popov 2005 ) .",
    "for instance , bulik et al . ( 2003 ) use the catalogue of xbp and propose the new open question about the distribution of peaks of x - ray lcs concerning with the formation scenario of the ns binary systems .",
    "they have counted the number of single and double peak x - ray lcs in published catalogues , and found that the observed number of single peak pulsars is relatively high .",
    "if the inclination of magnetic axis from the rotational axis is random , the majority of observed lc should have double peaks .",
    "then , they argued that , in order to explain the large number of single peak lcs , the inclination angle of the magnetic axis with respect to the rotational axis must be small .    in the investigation of the ns physics , lcs of xbps",
    "give us useful informations of the systems .",
    "the unique strong point of lc observation is that it does not depend on the distance to the source and carries us original information of central ns .",
    "generally , the light curves of those xbps are various .",
    "some of them show simple single / double peak pulses persistently , while a lot of systems shows complicated light curves .",
    "these complexity is caused by absorption by circumstellar matter , misalignment of the magnetic axis and rotation axis , doppler effect , and so on .",
    "also the shape of the lcs often depend on the observed energy band ( white et al .",
    "1983 ; nagase 1989 ) .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed in order to explain the energy dependency of lcs .",
    "for example , if the matter surrounding the ns has absorption rate which depends of the energy band , the observed x - ray lc will be different in each energy band ( white et al . 1983 ;",
    "marsden et al .",
    "however , the real situation is still under discussion .    in this paper",
    ", we examine whether we can say something new about ns physics from recently provided xbp catalogues .",
    "we mainly focus on the lc of xbp , which brings us the distance - independent information about the magnetized ns .",
    "firstly , we check the relationship of lc shapes with other observational properties of xbp .",
    "we find there is clear correlation between the lc complexity and the x - ray luminosity of xbp .",
    "this correlation can be explained by classical radiation column model given by basko , sunyaev ( 1976 ) .",
    "then we make statistical analysis of the lc of xbp .",
    "statistics of the lc distribution can be considered to reflect the axis inclination conditions of central ns .",
    "our analysis suggests that the inclination angle between the magnetic axis and the rotational axis of the central magnetized ns should be small .",
    "also it indicates that the opening angles of the x - ray beams from the radiative column should be narrow .",
    "since these ns properties are difficult to obtain from direct observations , such a statistical investigation becomes important .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the x - ray binary pulsar samples briefly . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we remind the basic model of radiative zone of nss . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , the data and analysis of x - ray pulsar samples is shown . in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] , we analyze the xbp sample statistically and discuss the obtained nature of central magnetized ns .",
    "the last section is devoted to the summary .",
    "thanks to several space observations by asca , beppo sax , cgro , chandra , ginga , integral , rosat , xmm - newton and so on , now we have a large number of xbp samples and candidates .",
    "firstly , we should mention that we are interested in the x - ray pulsars whose lcs are published .",
    "these xbps are listed in several catalogues ; here we refer to the catalogue of be / x binaries and candidates given by raguzova , popov ( 2005 ) , the catalogue of high - mass x - ray binaries given by liu , van paradijs , van den heuvel ( 2000 ) , the review and tables of discrete x - ray sources in small magellanic cloud ( smc ) given by yokogawa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the table of be / x - ray binaries in smc given by haberl , pietsch ( 2004 ) , the 2nd ibis / isgri soft gamma - ray survey catalogue given by bird et al . ( 2005 ) , and the list of observed light curves of x - ray pulsars given by bulik et al . ( 2003 ) . from these previous works , we chose 117 x - ray pulsars whose spin periods are known .",
    "70 of them are galactic sources , 41 are in smc and 6 are lmc sources .",
    "these chosen systems are listed in tables .",
    "[ tab : listg ]  [ tab : listl ] . even comparing with the generic and comprehensive previous analysis of x - ray pulsars given by white et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , nagase ( 1989 ) , bildsten et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , bulik et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and so on , our sample number is the largest .",
    "we prepare the following three tables ; systems in galaxy , small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , and large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) . in these tables , the x - ray binary systems are sorted by the spin period . in the third column of the tables , we show the type of light curves , which is categorized as following . among all the sample xbp , for 90 systems , the lcs have been taken and published in at least 2 energy bands .",
    "then we categorize those pulsars into 2 groups : regular lc group and irregular lc group .",
    "the diagnosis is the following .",
    "when we compare two light curves obtained in different energy bands , if ( i ) the number of peaks are different , and/or ( ii ) the phase of the peak is shifted ( roughly more than 20 % ) , then we categorize this pulsar as irregular group  .",
    "otherwise , it is put into regular group .",
    "some pulsars show marginal behaviors of lc , hence firstly we categorize them into regular group but indicate them as `` rm '' in the tables . for the systems",
    "whose light curve is published only for one energy band , we can not make diagnosis and indicate ``  '' in this column .    the fourth and fifth columns are devoted to the spin period of the ns and the orbital period of the system , respectively .",
    "the spin period @xmath2 is shown in unit of second , while the orbital period @xmath3 is in unit of day . in the sixth column , the x - ray luminosity @xmath4 ( @xmath5 )",
    "note that many systems of xbp are observed as transient x - ray sources . for almost all the systems ,",
    "@xmath4 coincides to the maximum luminosity of the system , and their lcs are taken in this bright phase .",
    "the surface magnetic field strength of the ns @xmath6 , which can be estimated from cyclotron line , is shown in seventh column . in the final column",
    ", we show the additional information . also the references of light curves are indicated here .",
    "we have to keep in mind that those data has been taken by different experiments , and hence the total luminosity of these xbps are estimated by different energy bands .",
    "this difference may make uncertainty of the total luminosity shown in the tables .",
    "the luminosity and mass accretion rate is strongly connected in ns accreting systems . in basko ,",
    "sunyaev ( 1976 ) , they derived the `` accretion rate '' as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is mass - accretion rate . and they proposed a critical accretion rate which is described as @xmath9 for a canonical ns with @xmath10 $ ] and @xmath11 . in the first equation , @xmath12 denotes the opacity . here",
    ", @xmath13 denotes the isotropic scattering cross - section , and @xmath14 is the thomson cross - section , respectively .",
    "@xmath15 indicates the circumference of the accretion cylinder ( see , fig .  1 in basko , sunyaev 1976 ) .",
    "they predict that if @xmath16 is smaller than @xmath17 , then the accretion channel is wholly optically thin .",
    "hence , the x - ray radiation is mainly emitted from the small cross section of the accretion column on the surface and the main beam is emitted into the direction along to magnetic axis .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath16 is larger than @xmath17 , the optical depth of the accretion column above the ns surface will be large .",
    "this optically thick region is called radiative column . in this radiative column ,",
    "the radiative pressure is no longer negligible and the accreting fluid decelerates significantly . passing this radiative column ,",
    "the fluid converts its kinetic energy into radiative energy .",
    "since the emitted photons can not go straight in this dense region , the photons are scattered and diffusively go out from side face of the column . here , note that , since the geometry of the accretion flow is not spherical , the radiation pressure becomes important even when the luminosity is less than the eddington limit for spherical accretions .",
    "the emission manner depends on the existence of accretion column .",
    "if the opaque radiative column appears , the x - ray radiation will be emitted from the side - face of the column , while the radiation is emitted in the polar direction from the cross - section of the column when such a column does not exist .",
    "x - ray emission in the direction of magnetic pole is called the _ pencil - beam _ , while side - face radiation is called the _ fan - beam_. considering these two manners of x - ray radiation , we can expect that the critical accretion rate @xmath17 can be understood also as the threshold of exchange between these two types of radiation .",
    "actually , there are examples which shows the dependence of the lc on the x - ray luminosity . for instance , the time dependent lc and @xmath4 of exo2030 + 375 ( g28 ) has been taken and the results show that the phase of the primary peak is completely changed with the threshold of @xmath18 $ ] ( parmar et al .",
    "1989a , b ) this shows the configuration of the accreting column changes at this threshold luminosity and subsequently the beam type is changed ( nagase 1989 ) .",
    "first of all , we check whether the observational quantities of xbp show any difference between irregular and regular groups . in fig .  [ fig : n - lx ] , the luminosity distributions of irregular group , regular group , and the whole sample of xbp are shown by thick solid , thick dashed , and thin dotted lines , respectively . from this figure",
    ", we can see that regular and irregular groups have different distributions ( with more than 99% probability according to the kolmogorov - smirnov test ) .",
    "the regular group shows almost symmetric distribution with an axis of symmetry around @xmath19 $ ] , and the upper and lower tails spread broadly . on the other hand ,",
    "irregular group distributes in a narrow region above @xmath20}$ ] .",
    "note that there are two exceptionally dim irregular lc pulsars , and they are g30 ( xtej1906 + 09 ) and s28 ( rxj0059.3 - 7223 ) .",
    "both of them have giant companions and are fed by wind accretion .    here",
    "we note that , especially for galactic sources , it is difficult to estimate the distance of the source precisely . because of this uncertainty , the luminosities of galactic xbps may have errors as large as factor of 10 ( haberl & sasaki 2000 ) . on the other hand , the distances ( and , hence , luminosities ) of smc / lmc xbps can be estimate much precisely . in order to avoid the uncertainties of the luminosities of galactic xbps",
    ", we can check the number counts of regular and irregular xbp luminosities only for smc / lmc sources , and confirm that the resultant distribution is almost the same with fig .",
    "[ fig : n - lx ] .",
    "also we would like to comment that the uncertainties of the luminosity could broaden the distributions not only of regular group but also of irregular group in fig .",
    "[ fig : n - lx ] .",
    "consequently the inconsistency of the distributions will be still essential , even with the uncertainty .",
    "( 80mm,60mm)fig1.eps    in fig .",

    "group pulsars are shown by small cross in the same figure .",
    "almost every pulsar distributes on upper - right region , while a few exists in lower - left region .",
    "these exceptional points are corresponding to the pulsars which are in the quiescent phase or in the propeller regime ( bildsten et al .",
    "according to the analysis given by ikhsanov ( 2003 ) and raguzova , popov ( 2005 ) , the accretion mode exchanges from the accretion to the propeller regime on the basis of a certain criterion .",
    "that is , if the condition @xmath22 is satisfied , the propeller effect does work , and accretion will be prevented .",
    "here , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the normalized magnetic moment and luminosity , respectively . at a glance ,",
    "the irregular pulsars distribute almost in the same region as regular pulsars .",
    "notice that , however , entire irregular group locates above , or near , the critical line of the propeller transition , shown by eq .",
    "( [ eq : prop ] ) .",
    "it indicates that in the propeller regime , the lc becomes regular , and it is consistent with the argument of basko , sunyaev ( 1976 ) .",
    "namely , in propeller regime , the accretion rate must be much smaller , since the accreting matter will be blown away . in this regime , and with consequent small accretion rate , it seems difficult to form the radiative dense column .",
    "hence , in this case , the x - ray radiation is mainly emitted as a pencil beam from tiny region on the stellar surface .",
    "then , in such regime , we can only observe simple pulse emitted in pencil manner .",

    "[ fig : ps - bp ] shows the spin period of regular and irregular lc pulsars plotted regarding to the magnetic field strength on the stellar surface .",
    "no significant difference can be seen between regular and irregular groups . since x - ray pulsar systems are not equilibrium systems , they are considered to be still in spin - evolutionary stage .",
    "it means that the spin period needs not any relation with magnetic field .",
    "there is one point which has exceptionally strong magnetic field ( @xmath25 $ ] ) , and this is g14 ( 1e1048.1 - 5937 ) . in our sample ,",
    "g13 , g14 , g68 and s9 are the candidates of anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps )",
    ". if they are , the radiative mechanism could be different from xbps , hence we should remove them from our sampling . in the analysis , we do not have the necessary lcs for g13 and s9 , and those pulsars are not included in the statistical results .",
    "g68 is a reliable candidate of axp , hence we exclude this from all analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "g14 is counted as a sample , hence this one point can be an error .",
    "historically , g14 has been considered as a candidate of xbp in the early stage ( seward et al .",
    "1986 ) , however , it is supposed as a candidate of an axp in the last few years ( tiengo et al .",

    "the number of observed regular pulsars increases with spin period and truncates at around 1,000 sec , while , the number of irregular group shows rather flat distribution .",
    "the spin of the magnetized ns accelerates via accretion process and decelerates in propeller regime .",
    "the irregular group pulsars , however , locate in the parameter region where propeller effect does not work ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig : ps - lx ] ) .",
    "hence , those irregular pulsars do not suffer from the spin down mechanism .",
    "then , they may keep their spin rapid and show rather flat distribution as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : n - po ] , the orbital period distributions of regular group , irregular group , and the total number including pulsars which lc is unpublished , are shown by solid , dashed , and dotted lines , respectively . from this figure , it is clear that irregular group shows quite flat distribution of the orbital period , while regular group has somehow a peak around 100 d. unfortunately , it is difficult to observe long orbital periods , say , longer than 1,000 d , since they need a long observational time ( several years ) .",
    "hence , near the upper end , we may have observational bias . here",
    ", we may expect the following scenario : the longer orbital period means the larger orbital separation .",
    "the larger separation may cause smaller accretion rate , if the mass of the primaries are almost the same .",
    "hence , from the condition given by @xmath26 , the number of irregular group decreases in large @xmath27 region .",
    "although this expectation matches to the tendency of the figure , it is required better statistics to confirm it .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig : n - lx ] , irregular group has clear minimum x - ray luminosities around @xmath28 , and this minimum limit coincides with the criterion of radiative column given by basko , sunyaev ( 1976 ) .",
    "namely , it is natural to consider that the _ irregularity _ of lc correlates with the existence of radiative column with finite height .    although there are two exceptions in fig .",
    "[ fig : n - lx ] , these two xbps have different type of companions and different accretion manners : wind - fed accretions from large companions .",
    "that is , the central ns of these systems are surrounded by huge amount of circumstellar matter . because of the large absorption by the surrounding matter , the small peak may be screened .",
    "also the clumpiness of the surrounding matter may cause the phase - dependent concealments of lcs ( nagase 1989 ) .",
    "these effects will be significant in lower energy bands , and they lead to the energy - dependent lc shapes .",
    "therefore , it may be possible to conclude that the irregularity of these pulsars is caused not by the configuration of radiative column , but by absorptions due to surrounding matter .",
    "if this is the case , all the other irregular pulsars satisfy the basko - sunyaev criterion , and can be considered to have radiative column with finite height .    examining strictly",
    ", we have to treat the x - ray luminosity carefully .",
    "the x - ray luminosities taken by different experiments are estimated based on different energy bands . for xbp ,",
    "it is difficult to estimate the total luminosity accurately , only from fragments of the spectra .",
    "however , in our sample , almost irregular xbps are observed in relatively broad energy bands , from 0.1 kev to several tens kev .",
    "it means that the x - ray luminosities of irregular xbps are estimated based on large part of the total spectra , with relatively high accuracy .",
    "hence , our conclusion that the irregular group has large x - ray luminosity is unchanged in our sample , even under the consideration of the uncertainty of the luminosity due to the lack of the spectra .",
    "reminded that , if a ns does not have a radiative column , x - rays will be emitted only as pencil beams in our basic conjecture .",
    "otherwise , x - ray lc is affected from the contribution of fan - beams .",
    "next we check that the radiative column really affects the shape of lc . and then , we examine whether we can obtain further informations of magnetized ns from the statistical analysis of lc .",
    "the x - rays from a ns are radiated in two different manners , that is , _",
    "pencil beam _ and _ fan beam_. the intensities of these two beams have the angular dependence ; the pencil beam gives the maximum intensity when the line of sight coincides with the magnetic axis , while the fan beam gives the maximum intensity when we observe the ns from the magnetic equator .",
    "hence , as the simplified models of beams , we assume that the intensity ( number of photons ) can be described as @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic axis . @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote certain factors generally depending on the spin phase @xmath33 .",
    "this @xmath34 ",
    "@xmath35 dependence comes from the radiating area seen by the observer ( nagel 1981 ) .",
    "we assume simple dipole magnetic poles , and do not include the effect of screening by the stellar surface , hence the both beams are observed at @xmath36 .    in general , x - ray photons with only higher energies",
    "can be emitted as the pencil beam , since along the magnetic axis the mean free path becomes so short that weak radiation can not escape in this sense , when the accretion column exists .",
    "on the other hand , from the side face of the accretion column , photons scattered and diffused many times are emitted as the fan beam .",
    "these side - way photons can have lower energies in average .",
    "when the height of the column is significant , the fan beam will be dominant , however , with a moderate height of column , pencil beam could not be neglected .",
    "hence , the observed beams of x - ray from the accretion column will be the mixture of the fan beam and the pencil beam .",
    "we model such a mixed beam as following;. @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are mixing factors which are defined by @xmath40 and @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "of course , @xmath42 corresponds to the fan - beam , while @xmath43 results in the pencil - beam . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc1 ] , we show some examples of the light curves generated in this manner , with different @xmath44 and @xmath45 . here , @xmath44 is the inclination angle between the magnetic axis and the rotational axis , while @xmath45 is that between the rotational axis and the line of sight .",
    "if the radiative region has finite side - face , it is natural to consider that both beams are emitted in some amounts ( mixed - beam ) .",
    "when we observe the mixture of them , the mixed beam will show more complicated pulse shapes .",
    "if we admit that the ratio @xmath46 depends on the energy of photons , the shape of the lc will be changed for each energy band , and the energy dependence of x - ray lcs can be explained naturally .",
    "for instance , if we see fig .",
    "[ fig : lc1 ] , and compare pencil- , fan- and mixed - beams , it is easily seen that some of them show the phase inversion and peak splitting .",
    "such a metamorphosis of the lc can be observed only when the radiative column exists .",
    "hence , we may conclude that the existence of the radiative column can cause the irregularity of some xbps .",
    "though it is difficult to explain all the irregularity of xbp lcs by only this mixed - beam hypothesis , some of the observed complicated lcs may be reconstructed by adopting this method .",

    "if such a radiative column with finite height emits both the pencil beam and fan beam and we can observe both beams , the observed light curve may show an irregular behavior . in our sample ,",
    "however , not all the pulsars with @xmath48 are categorized as irregular group , and a large fraction of bright pulsars show regular lc .",
    "in fact we have 40 bright pulsars with @xmath49 $ ] and 24 of them are regular members .",
    "if all the bright pulsars should show the irregular behavior , this fraction is inconsistent .",
    "actually , even if the radiative column appears and both beams are emitted , it does not mean every pulsar will be observed as irregular one . for instance , when the magnetic axis and the line of sight almost coincide , the pulse component due to fan beam will be very weak .",
    "hence , the observed lc will be dominated by pencil beam only , and can not be irregular .",
    "also when the magnetic axis almost coincides with rotation axis , the irregularity will not appear since the lc becomes flat .",
    "for another example , if the beam is collimated in small angle due to certain reasons ( it corresponds to large @xmath31 and @xmath32 in eq .",

    "also in this case , the observed lc will be dominated by only one of two beams and behave regularly .",

    "on the other hand , @xmath55 should be larger than 0.02  0.04 , so highly collimated beams are also unacceptable .    about the magnetic inclination angles , bulik et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have analysed the ratio of single peak lcs over all the observed lcs , and they conclude that average @xmath44 should be small in order to explain the observed ratio of single peak lc .",
    "it is interesting and to be emphasised that , although our analysis is completely independent from the light curve analysis given by bulik et al .",
    "( 2003 ) which is using the pulse peak number , our result also suggests the same conclusion of small @xmath44 .",
    "another reason why the sample of regular bright pulsars is over - sized might be the bias of observed energy bands . in this analysis",
    ", we are assuming that the fan - beam and the pencil - beam will be emitted in different energy bands .",
    "however , the energy bands in our sampling may not cover these different energy bands separately . for instance , even if assume that , for a certain xbp , we have observational data in 2 - 4kev and 4 - 10kev , it is not always that the pencil - beam and the fan - beam could be observed separately in those two bands . in our diagnosis ,",
    "unfortunately the used energy bands are miscellaneous and are not standardized . in actual diagnosis , 9 samples of 24 bright regular pulsars are based on the observed lc in only 2 energy bands . for the higher reliability ,",
    "we clearly need further samples in broader energy bands from soft x - ray to gamma - ray . for bright pulsars , the quality of the lc becomes better and small features in the lc can be distinguished , hence those bright pulsars may tend to be judged as irregular type . also from this observational bias ,",
    "this unexpectedly large fraction of regular component looks a kind of new mystery of xbp lcs .",
    "in fact , the radiation process from the radiative column itself has been still unclear . for the effective analysis , we need to know the exact energy band where the x - ray photons are emitted for both the pencil- and fan - beam . in order to know the reliable predominance of the emissions due to pencil - beam and fan - beam , we need to solve radiative - magneto - hydro equations .",
    "especially , from the point of view of beam opening angles , the radiation emitted from the radiative region in the strong magnetic field becomes important .",
    "in this study , we analyze the observed light curves of x - ray binary pulsars .",
    "we mainly focus on those xbp systems whose lcs are observed in multiple energy bands .",
    "we found that some of them show different shapes of lc in different energy bands , and we named such lcs as `` irregular '' type . looking for the origin of such an _ irregularity _ , we found that the x - ray luminosities of irregular systems are higher than @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "this criterion coincides with the critical limit for the existence of the accretion column with finite height , given by basko , sunyaev ( 1976 ) .",
    "the coincidence of the x - ray luminosity limit of irregular xbp with the apparent condition of the accretion column is fairly consistent because of following reason : when the accretion column exists , the x - ray radiation will be emitted not only as the pencil - beam , but also as the fan - beam .",
    "hence , if we observe those different beams ( and also combined beams ) in different energy bands , the observed x - ray lc will be different in each energy band .    additionally , we analysed the fraction of irregular xbp in all the observed system .",
    "it is apparent that not all the xbp with large @xmath87 show irregular lc .",
    "this occurs because for the observation of irregular lcs , the location of the observer has to satisfy the condition given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : incl ] ) .",
    "the probability to take such a location depends on the inclination angle of magnetic axis regarding to the rotational axis , and the opening angles of beams . to explain the observational fraction of irregular systems in our sample , the small inclination angle of the magnetic axis",
    "is strongly required .",
    "this result is consistent with the independent analysis given by bulik et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . in our sampling",
    ", however , the completeness of the observed energy dependence is not so good . in near future",
    ", we would like to collect larger number of samples with broad energy band , and analyze the data in detail . at the same time",
    ", an improvement of the theoretical modelling of x - ray emission mechanisms in xbp is strongly required for better understanding of these systems .",
