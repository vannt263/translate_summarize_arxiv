    "during a ccd imaging campaign with the 40-inch telescope at siding spring observatory carried out by one of us ( hj ) in 1999 , the galaxy ngc  5011c only 7.7 arcmin away from the target galaxy eso  269-g070 was falling into the @xmath6sqarcmin field - of - view and attracted the attention because of its morphological appearance resembling closely that of a nearby dwarf elliptical galaxy .",
    "most strikingly the stellar system exhibits the featureless light distribution with the characteristic low central surface brightness .",
    "however , a search through the literature for more details about this galaxy suggested a different picture .",
    "based on its position in the sky and published redshift measurements of over 3000kms@xmath7 , ngc  5011c should be a member of the distant centaurus cluster .",
    "if true , the immediate question arises what kind of galaxy this is with a physical size larger than that of the neighboring centaurus cluster member , the s0 galaxy ngc  5011b , but with the stellar surface density of a low luminous dwarf galaxy ( see fig .",
    "1 ) ?    the galaxy ngc  5011c ( eso",
    "269-g068 ) is located in the general direction of the cena group and the centaurus cluster .",
    "the nearby cena group has a mean distance from the milky way of 3.7  mpc ( jerjen , freeman & binggeli @xcite ; karachentsev et al .",
    "@xcite ) and a mean heliocentric velocity @xmath8kms@xmath7 ( ct et al .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the centaurus cluster is @xmath9 times further away at 45.3mpc ( mieske , hilker & infante @xcite ) .",
    "dickens , currie & lucey ( @xcite ) reported a redshift of 3195kms@xmath7 for ngc  5011c ( galaxy # 531 ) , consistent with the 3200kms@xmath7 from fairall ( @xcite ) , which immediately implies an association with the cen30 component of the centaurus cluster that has a mean velocity of @xmath10kms@xmath7 ( lucey , currie & dickens @xcite ) . from its location ,",
    "ngc  5011c seems to form a physical pair with the other centaurus cluster member , the s0 galaxy ngc  5011b ( eso  269-g067 ) , which is only 1.1arcmin to the north ( fig .  1 ) and has a very similar redshift of 3294kms@xmath7 as reported by the same authors ( galaxy # 530 ) .",
    "however , despite the small projected distance of only 14kpc there is no obvious optical sign of interaction between the two .    more confusion was added to the picture by the results from dressler ( @xcite ) .",
    "the galaxy catalog listed a redshift only for ngc  5011c ( 3293kms@xmath7 , galaxy # 456 ) while no measurement was reported for ngc5011b .",
    "this appeared somewhat strange as the central surface brightness of ngc5011b is approximately four magnitudes higher than that of ngc5011c making the former galaxy a more logical target for a redshift measurement .",
    "the present paper reports on our spectroscopic and optical follow up of the galaxy pair to shed more light on this confusing situation around the two galaxies ngc5011b and c. in the next section we describe our 3.6 m observations and data reduction , and the age and metallicity of the stellar populations dominating the galaxies light are determined in  3 .",
    "the new recession velocities for the two galaxies are presented in  4 followed by a photometric analysis with a rough distance estimate for ngc5011c in  5 and a discussion in  6 .",
    "the observations were carried out with the eso  3.6 m telescope at la silla , during an efosc2 ( buzzoni et al .",
    "@xcite ) technical night , with the purpose of testing all science and calibration templates , and to estimate the photometric zero points and the grism efficiencies .",
    "the `` rotate to slit '' template was tested by putting the nuclei of ngc  5011b and c into the same 1arcsec slit , and taking @xmath11sec spectra .",
    "before and after the galaxies observation , spectrophotometric standards were observed , and immediately after the end of the last spectrum , @xmath12sec spectra of a radial velocity standard were also taken .",
    "although several grisms were tested during the night , for this particular set of data grism # 11 was used , since it gives a good wavelength coverage and its intermediate dispersion allows to obtain a good s / n for faint targets in relatively short times .",
    "an observing log is listed in table  [ tabcap : journal - of - the ] .",
    "the radial velocity standard is hd125184 ( from udry et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the rest of the objects in the table are spectrophotometric standards from hamuy et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "all reductions were carried out with the eso - midas data processing system ( e.g. warmels @xcite ) , and in particular within the long context , which provides commands to perform the standard reduction steps of long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "a series of scripts were written to facilitate as much as possible the batch reduction of several spectra , and they are publicly available in the efosc2 instrument pages .",
    "we first prepared the system to reduce the night spectra , using the afternoon calibrations : the frames were rotated to have the wavelength increasing along the ccd rows , a median bias frame was created and subtracted from the rest of the frames , and a normalized flat - field was also generated . to do this , five flat - fields taken with slit @xmath13 were median combined , and then a two - dimensional polynomial was fitted to the resulting   slit .",
    "a database of wavelength solutions for each efosc2 grism is also published in the instrument web pages , so by using the appropriate guess session for grism # 11 it was straightforward to get the solution for the current data set . after searching the master arc for emission lines , and after defining a two - dimensional grid of points distributed on the arc ridge lines ,",
    "the grid was fitted with a two - dimensional polynomial , with degree 3 along the dispersion axis , and degree 2 along the spatial direction , which is enough to correct the curvature of the arc lines .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "error of the wavelength solution is @xmath14   , and the calibrated spectra cover the range 3383 to 7505   with a dispersion of 4.23  / pix .",
    "the width of the arc lines at 5000   is @xmath15   , so a velocity measurement based on a single spectral line has a 1-sigma error of @xmath16 .    during the night , after a new spectrum was taken , it was reduced using the calibration data prepared above : it was rotated and trimmed , bias - subtracted and flat - fielded , and the wavelength calibration was applied , which transforms the bidimensional frames from the pixel @xmath17 space to the @xmath18 space , where @xmath19 is the spatial direction after correction for the distortion introduced by the grism .",
    "the one - dimensional spectra were extracted with a simple average over the rows covered by the profile , and then multiplied by the number of rows .",
    "the extraction window was defined by inspecting the spatial profile of the spectra , and taking the rows were the spectrum was significantly brighter than the background .",
    "prior to the extraction , the sky background was subtracted from each frame : two template sky spectra were defined in two windows preceding and following the target spectrum , and the sky background at the position of the target was defined by a linear interpolation between these two spectra .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard ltt  3218 was used to define the response function of the grism : in this case the spectrum was extracted using a very wide window and then compared to the spectrum published by hamuy et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra were flux - calibrated by first normalizing by their exposure time and then dividing by the response function . prior to this",
    ", they were corrected for atmospheric extinction using the average curve at la silla .",
    "the fully reduced and calibrated spectra of the two galaxies are shown in fig .",
    "[ figcap : the - flux - calibrated - spectra ] .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ngc  5011b is obviously redder than that of ngc  5011c , but a more quantitative comparison of these two spectra is not possible , since the slit was aligned along the two galaxy centers , and not along the parallactic angle . to overcome this problem , we started from the fact that ngc  5011b is classified as an s0 galaxy ( lauberts @xcite ) . looking at fig .  1 of zaritsky et al .",
    "( @xcite ) one can see that the seds of this class of galaxies are rather uniform , so by selecting a template spectrum and comparing it to our observed one , we can estimate the degree of loss of blue flux induced by the differential atmospheric refraction .",
    "zaritsky et al .",
    "used the spectral atlas of kennicutt ( @xcite ) , which includes five s0 galaxies .",
    "we chose ngc  3245 since , compared to the other templates , it has no emission lines , its sed is not rising in the blue , it extends to redder wavelengths , and it has better spectral resolution . by dividing the ngc  5011b spectrum by the template (",
    "redshift corrected ) , a correction function was found , which is smoothly declining from red to blue , reaching at @xmath20    @xmath21 of the value at @xmath22   . in other words ,",
    "@xmath23 of the blue flux was lost during the observation .",
    "the trend of the correction is well fit by a straight line , which was then used to compute the intrinsic seds of the two galaxies .",
    "the corrected spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ figcap : the - flux - calibrated - spectra ] together with the original ones , and after normalizing their fluxes to unity at @xmath24   .",
    "the original spectra of ngc  5011b and ngc  5011c have fluxes reaching a maximum of @xmath25  erg  @xmath26  sec@xmath7  @xmath7 in the @xmath27 band and @xmath28  erg  @xmath26  sec@xmath7  @xmath7 in the @xmath29 band , respectively . in the @xmath27 band ,",
    "ngc  5011c is four magnitudes fainter than ngc  5011b .",
    "a first check of the correctness of our seds can be done by using them to perform synthetic broad - band photometry in order to compute colors , and then comparing the result to that obtained with our direct imaging . to compute synthetic colors ,",
    "a stellar a0i template was taken from jacoby et al .",
    "( @xcite ) library , and instrumental magnitudes and color were computed by integrating it within the johnson @xmath29 and @xmath30 filter passbands from bessell ( @xcite ) .",
    "a zero - point correction was then computed , to calibrate the color to the standard johnson system ; the color of an a0i star ( @xmath31 ) was taken from allen s astrophysical quantities ( cox @xcite ) . by repeating this procedure with the two galactic seds as input , we found @xmath32 and @xmath33 for ngc  5011b and ngc  5011c , respectively .",
    "the spectrum of ngc  5011c has been extracted in the central @xmath34 , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : sbprofiles ] one can see that @xmath35 at the center of the galaxy ( see below ) .",
    "the synthetic color is thus in good agreement with that obtained from broad - band surface photometry , which means that our correction indeed yields a reliable sed .",
    "after this consistency check , we can interpret the two seds using population synthesis techniques .",
    "for that purpose we used galaxev from bruzual & charlot ( @xcite ; bc03 ) , to estimate the luminosity - weighted age and metallicity",
    ". a grid of model seds were generated , based on the padova 1994 tracks ( see bc03 for the references ) with an input salpeter stellar mass function .",
    "computations were done for ages ranging from @xmath36  gyr to @xmath37  gyr , and for five of the available metallicities @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . the age was increased in steps of @xmath36  gyr up to @xmath43  gyr , and in steps of @xmath43  gyr for older ages , and the spectra were degraded to our instrumental resolution with software provided by bc03 .",
    "the best - fit was searched by minimizing the difference between model and observed seds . in this way we found that the best solution is obtained for an age of @xmath4  gyr and @xmath44 for ngc  5011c , and for an age of @xmath3  gyr and @xmath45 for ngc  5011b .",
    "in the bc03 scale the metallicity of the sun is @xmath45 , so the two metallicities are @xmath5 solar and solar , respectively .",
    "the good match between the theoretical and observed seds can be checked in fig .",
    "[ figcap : the - flux - calibrated - spectra ] .",
    "note that these results only apply to the central regions of the two galaxies ; for example the ngc  5011c spectrum was extracted in the central @xmath34 , which correspond to @xmath46  pc at the estimated distance of the galaxy ( see below ) .",
    "the age and metallicity thus represent the central stellar population only , and since the rest of the galaxy has redder colors presumably it hosts older populations , as is evident from fig .",

    "mpc it converts into @xmath48 , and assuming @xmath49 , the total luminosity can be computed . finally , from fig .",
    "1 of bc03 one can estimate that , for an age of @xmath43  gyr , the mass - to - light ratio is @xmath50 , so the mass of the galaxy is @xmath51 .",
    "this value of the mass is only valid in the single age approximation , but it s very likely that the sfh of the galaxy is more extended , so realistically that mass represents only a lower limit .",
    "but even with this caveat , the stellar mass is in the regime of that of dwarf galaxies .",
    "a brief inspection of the prominent balmer lines in the spectra ( see fig .  [ figcap : the - flux - calibrated - spectra ] ) quickly reveals that the two galaxies must have quite different redshifts in contrast to what has been reported in the literature .",
    "an initial estimate of the recession velocities can be obtained by measuring the central wavelength of one of these lines .",
    "for example , the center of h@xmath52 is at @xmath53  in the ngc  5011b spectrum but at @xmath54  in the ngc  5011c spectrum ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : the - upper - two ] ) .",

    "we cross - correlated our spectra with that of the radial velocity standard hd125184 , thus obtaining the relative velocity of each galaxy with respect to that of the standard star . if we call this relative velocity @xmath58 , then the true heliocentric velocity of the galaxy is@xmath59 where @xmath60 is the heliocentric correction listed in table  [ tabcap : journal - of - the ] , and the heliocentric velocity of the standard star is @xmath61 . from the same table",

    "the spectra were first trimmed to @xmath63and then continuum - normalized , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : the - upper - two ]",
    ". additionally , in the case of ngc  5011c the region containing h@xmath64 and the g band was masked out before cross - correlating the two spectra : the two features are located close to each other at our spectral resolution and as h@xmath64 is basically absent in the rv standard spectrum , the algorithm would overestimate the velocity as it attempts to correlate h@xmath64 in the galaxy spectrum with the g band in the standard star spectrum . masking",
    "the two spectra accordingly removed the confusion leading to a more realistic velocity estimate with a reduced measurement error . at the end of this analysis",
    "we get @xmath65 and @xmath66 , so the heliocentric velocities are @xmath2 and @xmath1 for ngc  5011b and ngc  5011c , respectively .",
    "to gain insight into ngc5011c s colors and photometric parameters , shallow broad - band b , v , and r frames of 90s , 60s , and 30s integration time , respectively , were acquired with the efosc2 instrument during the same observing night ( see table  [ tabcap : journal - of - the ] ) .",

    "@xcite ) this translates into an absolute magnitude of @xmath88mag . combining that number with the apparent b magnitude in table [ photdata ] we infer a distance modulus of @xmath89mag or a distance range of 4.718.6mpc .",

    "the main conclusion we can draw from these estimates based on photometric properties is that the derived distance intervals are consistent with ngc5011c being a member of the cena group at 3.7mpc ( jerjen , freeman & binggeli 2000 ; karachentsev @xcite ) but incompatible with the centaurus cluster distance of 45.3mpc ( mieske , hilker & infante @xcite ) .",
