    "we can confirm the prominent role of spin - orbit interaction for the spin - flip tunnel coupling .",
    "for our specific geometry , we find the resulting effective photon - assisted coupling energy to be @xmath0 ev ( depending on the microwave power applied ) , which would correspond to rabi oscillations on a mhz timescale . furthermore , from the measurements we can extract the relaxation and dephasing times @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the two - level system , yielding @xmath3s ( at a level splitting of 85 @xmath4ev ) and @xmath5 ps .",

    "the voltages on the various gates can be used to tune different properties of the dqd .",
    "the gate settings are chosen such that the dqd behaves as a relatively closed system : the tunneling rates from the dqd to the leads are @xmath7 times smaller than the interdot tunneling rate .",

    "a magnetic field of magnitude @xmath8 was applied along the dqd interdot - axis . finally , a cobalt micromagnet ( red rectangle ) was also present in the system , creating a magnetic field gradient across the dots .",

    "a first observation is that the time - dependent signal does not seem to exhibit rabi oscillations .",
