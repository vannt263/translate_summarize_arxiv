    "<S> we find good agreement between experiment and renormalization group theory , but only when we generalize the anderson impurity model to include a static hole and a dynamic dot - electron scattering potential . </S>",
    "<S> the latter highlights the fact that an optically active dot acts as a tunable quantum impurity , enabling the investigation of a new dynamic regime of fermi - edge physics .    </S>",
    "<S> when a fermionic reservoir ( fr ) experiences a dynamically changing local perturbation , all its eigenstates are modified in response ; the resulting anderson s orthogonality catastrophe @xcite plays a central role in the physics of quantum impurity systems . along with the kondo effect , </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the most extensively studied quantum impurity problem is the fermi edge singularity ( fes ) : @xcite an optical absorption event induces a local quantum quench , causing dynamical changes in reservoir states that lead to power - law tails in the absorption line shape . </S>",
    "<S> this has been observed , for example , in the context of x - ray absorption in metals , @xcite where a large ensemble of deep - level states were ionized upon absorption and the resulting collective modification of the absorption line shape was measured . </S>",
    "<S> a related many - body effect has also been investigated in semiconductor structures incorporating a degenerate electron gas : @xcite in these studies , the modification of the absorption line shape is due to a rearrangement of the conduction - band electrons after the creation of an electrostatic potential by photoexcited quasimobile valence - band holes .    in this rapid communication , we report the observation of a fes due to a single localized hole in a charge - tunable quantum dot ( qd ) and a tunnel - coupled fr . in our experiments , </S>",
    "<S> the ionization of a qd valence - band electron takes place via two competing paths : ( 1 ) excitation of a qd neutral exciton followed by ionization due to tunneling of the conduction - band electron into the fr , and ( 2 ) a direct transition from qd valence band to an electronic state above the fermi level of the fr . while in the classic x - ray absorption experiments only the latter process is relevant , in our experiments both contribute to single - photon absorption . </S>",
    "<S> since both paths lead to final states of identical structure , involving a single - hole charged qd and a fr whose eigenstates are modified by the qd scattering potential , we observe a fano interference @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the constructive nature of this interference we can observe the signature of the fes despite the small transition probability associated with path ( 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of path ( 1 ) is also responsible for the dynamical local screening of the hole potential . </S>",
