    "the mean value has long been used as a measure of location of the center of a distribution . however , in many applications , there are occasions when analysts are interested to observe and analyze different points of the distribution . the distribution function @xmath0 of a random variable",
    "can be characterized by infinite number of points spanning its support .",
    "these points are called quantiles .",
    "thus , quantiles are points taken at regular intervals from @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath1th quantile of a data distribution , @xmath2 , is interpreted as the value such that there is @xmath3 of mass on its right side and @xmath4 of mass on its left side . in particular , for a continuous random variable @xmath5 , the @xmath4 quantile of @xmath0 is the value @xmath6 which solves @xmath7 ( we assume that this value is unique ) , where @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the population lower quartile , median and upper quartile are the solutions to the equations @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . compared to mean value , quantiles are useful measures because they are less susceptible to skewed distributions and outliers .",
    "this fact form the building block of quantile regression which unlike its standard mean regression counterpart , lies in its flexibility and ability in providing a more complete investigation of the entire conditional distribution of the response variable distribution given its predictors . to this end",
    ", quantile regression has become increasingly popular since the pioneering research of @xcite .    after its introduction ,",
    "quantile regression has attracted considerable attention in recent literature .",
    "it has been applied in a wide range of fields such as agriculture @xcite , body mass index @xcite , microarray study @xcite , financial portfolio @xcite , economics @xcite , ecology @xcite , climate change @xcite , survival analysis @xcite and so on .",
    "a comprehensive account of other recent applications of quantile regression can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "longitudinal data is encountered in a wide variety of applications , including economics , finance , medicine , psychology and sociology .",
    "it is repeatedly measured from independent subjects over time and correlation arises between measures from the same subject . since the pioneering work by @xcite ,",
    "the mixed models with random effects have become common and active models to deal with longitudinal data .",
    "a number of books and a vast number of research papers published in this area have been motivated by laird and ware s mixed models .",
    "the majority of these books and research papers focuses on standard mean regression .",
    "see for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among others .",
    "in contrast , limited research papers have been conducted on quantile regression for longitudinal data .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed the @xmath12 regularization quantile regression model , @xcite studied quantile regression for longitudinal data in different contexts and developed resampling approaches for inference .",
    "@xcite suggested a bayesian quantile regression method for longitudinal data using the skewed laplace distribution ( sld ) for the errors , @xcite proposed a flexible bayesian quantile regression method for dependent and independent data using an infinite mixture of normals for the errors , @xcite studied quantile regression for longitudinal data with nonignorable intermittent missing data and @xcite proposed a method for regularization in mixed quantile regression models .",
    "longitudinal data with ordinal responses routinely appear in many applications , including economics , psychology and sociology .",
    "existing approaches in classical mean regression are typically designed to deal with such data . at present time , the most common method in classical mean regression for modelling such data employs the cumulative logit model .",
    "there exists a large literature on the analysis of longitudinal data with ordinal responses , and we refer to @xcite for an overview . in contrast ,",
    "quantile regression approaches for estimating the parameters of ordinal longitudinal data have not been proposed , yet .",
    "the goal of this paper is to fill this gap by introducing an ordinal random effects quantile regression model that is appropriate for such data .    in section",
    "[ methods ] , we present a random effects ordinal quantile regression model for analysis of longitudinal data with ordinal outcome by using a data augmentation method .",
    "we also discuss prior elicitation . in section [ gibbs sampler ] , we outline the bayesian estimation method via gibbs sampler . in section [ simulation_studies ] ,",
    "we carry out simulation scenarios to investigate the performance of the proposed method , and in section [ rd ] , we illustrate our proposed method using a real dataset .",
    "we conclude the paper with a brief discussion in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "an appendix contains the gibbs sampler details .",
    "given training data @xmath13 with covariate vector @xmath14 and outcome of interest @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath1th quantile regression model for the response @xmath16 given the covariate vector @xmath17 takes the form of @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the inverse cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) and @xmath20 is the unknown quantile coefficients vector .",
    "this is what makes the quantile estimators can be considered nonparametric maximum likelihood estimators @xcite .    unlike the standard mean regression",
    ", the error term does not appear in ( [ eq1 ] ) because all the random variation in the conditional distributions is accounted for by variation in the @xmath1th quantile , @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , quantile regression does not require any assumption about the distribution of the errors and , unlike standard mean regression , is more robust to outliers and non - normal errors , offering greater statistical efficiency if the data have outliers or is non - normal .",
    "it belongs to a robust model family , which can provide a more complete picture of the predictor effects at different quantile levels of the response variable rather than focusing solely on the center of the distribution @xcite",
    ". one attractive feature of quantile regression is that the linear quantile regression model @xcite can be used to estimate the parameters of the nonlinear model because the quantile regression estimators are equivariant to linear or nonlinear monotonic transformations of the response variable , i.e. , @xmath21 . in general , this is a very important property since it tells us that quantile regression provides consistent back transformation and easy in interpretation in the case of transformations such as the logarithm and the square root .",
    "the quantile estimators have the same interpretation as those of a standard mean regression model except for the indexed quantile levels where each is estimated @xcite .",
    "for example , if the slope is -0.78 for the response variable @xmath6 given the predictor @xmath22 in the @xmath23th quantile would indicate that the @xmath23th quantile of the response variable decreased by 0.78 for each 1 unit increase in @xmath22 .",
    "the unknown quantity @xmath20 is estimated by    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the check loss function ( clf ) at a quantile @xmath1 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the indicator function .",
    "by contrast , standard mean regression method based on the quadratic loss @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite observed that the clf ( [ eq2 ] ) is closely related to the skewed laplace distribution ( sld ) and consequently the unknown quantity @xmath20 can be estimated through exploiting this link .",
    "this observation opens new avenues when dealing with quantile regression and its applications .",
    "the density function of a sld is @xmath29 minimizing the clf ( [ eq2 ] ) is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood function of @xmath30 by assuming @xmath31 from a sld . by utilizing the link between the clf ( [ eq2 ] ) and the sld , @xcite proposed a bayesian framework for quantile regression using the sld for the error distribution and show the propriety of the conditional distribution of @xmath20 under an improper prior distribution .",
    "unfortunately , the joint posterior distribution under this framework does not have a known tractable form and consequently @xcite update the unknown quntity @xmath20 from its posterior using the metropolis - hastings ( m - h ) algorithm . in this context",
    ", @xcite proposes a simple and efficient gibbs sampling algorithm for updating @xmath20 by motivating the sld as a member of the scale mixture of normals . if @xmath32 , then the sld for @xmath33 arises when @xmath34 has an exponential distribution with rate parameter @xmath35 . under this formulation",
    ", @xcite presented a bayesian framework for structured additive quantile regression models , @xcite developed bayesian quantile regression for longitudinal data and @xcite presented bayesian lasso mixed quantile regression .",
    "let @xmath36 , where @xmath37 denote the response for the @xmath38th subject measured at the @xmath39th time .",
    "then , the @xmath1th quantile regression model for ordinal longitudinal data can be formulated in terms of an ordinal latent variable @xmath40 as follows : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the inverse cdf of the unobserved latent response @xmath40 conditional on a location - shift random effect @xmath43 , @xmath44n@xmath45 , and @xmath46 is a vector of predictors .",
    "the observed ordinal response @xmath37 is assumed to be related to the unobserved response @xmath40 by    @xmath47 +   + where @xmath48 are cut - points whose coordinates satisfy @xmath49 here , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are respectively defines the lower and upper bounds of the interval corresponding to observed outcome @xmath52 .",
    "assuming that the error @xmath53 of the unobserved response @xmath40 has a sld as in ( [ eq3 ] ) , we have @xmath54 @xcite . here ,",
    "the latent variable @xmath55 follows an exponential distribution with rate parameter @xmath35 , and @xmath56 follows the standard normal distribution .",
    "then , the cdf for the c category of the observed response @xmath37 is : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the standard normal cdf .",
    "using @xmath58 , we can calculate @xmath59 as follows : @xmath60      prior distribution selection is an essential step in any bayesian inference ; however , in the bayesian paradigm it is particularly crucial as issues can arise when default prior distributions are used without caution @xcite . for the fixed effects ,",
    "a typical choice is to assign a zero mean normal prior distribution on each @xmath61 , which leads to the ridge estimator .",
    "however , this prior performs poorly if there are big differences in the size of fixed effects @xcite .",
    "an generalization of the ridge prior is a laplace prior , which is equivalent to the lasso model @xcite .",
    "this prior  has received considerable attention in the recent literature ( for example see , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we assign a laplace prior on each @xmath62 takes the form of @xmath63 according to @xcite , the prior ( [ eq8 ] ) can be written as @xmath64 from ( [ eq9 ] ) , it can be seen that we assign a zero - mean normal prior distribution with unknown variance for each @xmath62 .",
    "we specify an exponential prior distributions with rate parameter @xmath65 for the variances assuming they are independent .",
    "then , we put a gamma prior on @xmath66 with shape parameter @xmath67 and rate parameter @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath44n@xmath45 , this motivates us to consider an inverse gamma prior on @xmath69 with shape parameter @xmath70 and scale parameter @xmath71 .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we consider an order statistics from @xmath72 distribution , for the @xmath73 unknown cut - points : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 because @xmath77n@xmath78 and we observe @xmath79 if @xmath80 , the posterior distribution of all the parameters and latent variables is given by @xmath81 where , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "the convergence of the proposed gibbs sampling algorithm in this simulation study was monitored using the multivariate potential scale reduction factor ( mpsrf ) reported by @xcite .    from figure ( [ fig1 ] ) , it can be observed that the mpsrf becomes stable and very close to 1 after about the first 5000 iterations for each quantile level under consideration .",
    "hence , the convergence to the posterior distribution was quick and the mixing was good .",
    "in this section , we consider a data set from the national institute of mental health schizophrenia collaborative ( nimhsc ) study previously analysed by @xcite .",
    "the objective of this study is to assess treatment - related changes in illness severity over time . specifically , we studied item 79 ( imps79o ; severity of illness ) of the inpatient multidimensional psychiatric scale .",

    "the methods are assessed based on @xmath148 credible intervals and the deviance information criterion ( dic ; * ? ? ?",
    "clearly , it can be seen that the credible intervals ( 95% ci ) obtained using the bqol when @xmath149 are generally shorter than the credible intervals obtained using the blor , suggesting an efficiency gain and stable estimation from the posterior distributions .",
    "in addition , dic was computed for our model when @xmath149 and @xmath146 as well as for blor and the numbers were 3311.32 , 3615.48 and 3417.39 , respectively .",
    "hence , under @xmath149 , model comparison using dic indicates that quantile ordinal models can give a better model fit compared to the bayesian logistic ordinal regression ( blor ) for longitudinal data .",
    "this shows that the model uesd for the errors in ( [ eq3 ] ) is a working model with articial assumptions , employed on the outcome variable to achieve the equivalence between maximising sld and the minimising proplem in ( [ eq2 ] ) .",

    "the proposed approach is illustrated using simulated data and a real data example .",
    "results show that the proposed approach performs well .",
    "one of the most desirable features of the proposed method is its model robustness in the sense that makes very minimal assumptions on the form of the error term distribution and thus is able to accommodate non - normal errors and outliers , which are popular in many real world applications .",
