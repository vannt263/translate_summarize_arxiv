    "for locally isotropic turbulence , kolmogorov @xcite considered that small - scale statistics are uniquely determined by the kinematic viscosity @xmath0 and the mean rate of energy dissipation @xmath1 .",

    "the signal was linearized , low - pass filtered at 35khz , and then digitally sampled at @xmath25khz .",
    "we obtained as long as @xmath26 data .",
    "the calibration coefficient , with which the flow velocity is proportional to the anemometer signal , depends on the condition of the hot wires and thereby varied slowly in time .",
    "we determine the coefficient so as to have @xmath27ms@xmath28 for each segment with @xmath29 data . within each segment , the coefficient varied by @xmath30% at most . also varied slowly in time the flow temperature and hence the kinematic viscosity @xmath0 .",

    "the process is related with the energy transfer .",
    "while the mean energy transfer is to a smaller scale and is significant between scales in the inertial range alone , the local energy transfer is either to a smaller or larger scale and is significant between all scales.@xcite any scale is thereby affected by itself and by many other scales .",

    "the fluctuations among segments at @xmath89 have interesting correlations .",

    "the former varies only by a factor of 1.5 while the latter varies by a factor of 20 . when @xmath98 [ fig .",
    "[ f4](a ) ] , @xmath95 is not independent of @xmath97 .",
    "the implication of the above result is that the mean rate of energy transfer that determines @xmath75 correlates with the mean rate of energy dissipation @xmath76 that determines @xmath77 and @xmath73 among segments with @xmath89 . here",
    "@xmath43 is the typical scale for energy - containing eddies .",
    "most of the energy of such an eddy is transferred through scales and dissipated within its own volume .",
    "thus , each energy - containing eddy tends toward equilibrium between the mean rates of energy transfer and dissipation .",
    "this tendency does not exist at @xmath99.@xcite within an energy - containing eddy , the spatial distribution of @xmath13 is not homogeneous . in fact , the @xmath13 correlation is significant at @xmath100 [ fig . [ f1](b ) ] .",
    "therefore , in order for statistics such as @xmath67 and @xmath95 to have physical meanings , the minimum segment length is about @xmath43 .",

    "thus , segments obey a correlation between @xmath84 and @xmath76 characterized by the re@xmath47 value .",

    "a consistent result is obtained for @xmath106 in fig . [ f5](b ) .",
    "the above tendency toward a constant microscale reynolds number originates in energy - containing scales .",
    "in general , through an empirical relation @xmath107 , re@xmath47 is related to the reynolds number for energy - containing scales as @xmath108 .",

    "the correlation length @xmath112 should be accordingly larger .",
    "the process for each segment to reflect the large - scale flow could be related to the energy transfer .",
    "as noted before , the energy transfer couples all scales .",
    "the energy transfer itself is affected by the large - scale flow .",
    "this is because energy is transferred between two scales via an interaction with some other scale .",
    "when the interaction occurs with a large scale , the energy transfer is strong.@xcite      obukhov@xcite discussed that , through the fluctuation of the @xmath76 value , the large - scale flow affects small - scale statistics for the whole region such as @xmath113 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath10 is obtained at a fixed @xmath5 , regardless of the fluctuations of @xmath114 and @xmath73 induced by the fluctuation of @xmath76 .",
    "we are to discuss that the fluctuation of the @xmath76 value is not important so far as @xmath89 . this condition on @xmath58",
    "is required for the @xmath76 value to correlate with and thus statistically represent the mean rate of energy transfer that determines @xmath115 .",
    "figure [ f7 ] compares @xmath116 to @xmath117 , i.e. , average of @xmath118 at each @xmath74 over all segments , with @xmath96 . even for @xmath119 [ fig . [ f7](b ) ] , they are not distinguishable [ see also fig . [ f4](b ) ] .",
    "although @xmath82 and hence @xmath120 and @xmath73 fluctuate among segments , these fluctuations are not large enough for @xmath116 to differ from @xmath117 .",

    "these two rates still correlate among segments with @xmath89 ( fig . [ f4 ] ) , which tend toward equilibrium between the two rates .",
    "also between @xmath76 and @xmath124 , there is a correlation characterized by re@xmath47 for the whole record ( fig .",
    "thus , the large - scale flow affects each of the segments .",
    "the observed fluctuations depend on @xmath43 and re@xmath47 , which in turn depend on the configuration for turbulence production , e.g. , boundaries such as the grid used in our experiment .",
    "nevertheless , the significance of those fluctuations implies that they have been developed in turbulence itself .",
    "their lognormal distributions are explained by a multiplicative stochastic process in turbulence , which is related with the energy transfer among scales .",
    "the correlations among the fluctuations are also explained in terms of the energy transfer .",
    "previous studies@xcite suggested that the large - scale flow affects some small - scale statistics , although this has to be confirmed at higher re@xmath47 where large and small scales are more distinct.@xcite if the effect really exists , it is inherent individually in the segments .",
    "our study was motivated by obukhov s discussion.@xcite it implies the presence of equilibrium between the mean rates of energy transfer and dissipation in an ensemble of segments with similar values of @xmath76 .",
    "this is the case at @xmath89 ( fig .",
    "[ f4]).@xcite also as discussed by obukhov , the distribution of @xmath76 is lognormal at least as a good approximation ( figs .",

    "however , although obukhov discussed that the large - scale flow affects small - scale statistics through the fluctuation of the @xmath76 value , this is not the case ( fig .",

    "the lognormal distributions observed here have to be distinguished from those proposed by kolmogorov.@xcite while he was interested in small - scale intermittency and studied @xmath125 and @xmath126 at small @xmath5 to obtain their scaling laws , we are interested in large - scale fluctuations and have studied @xmath76 and @xmath115 at small @xmath5 but at large @xmath58",
    ". the scaling laws of @xmath76 and @xmath115 are not necessary . in addition , the lognormality has been attributed to a different process .",
    "hence , our study is not necessarily concerned with the well - known problems of kolmogorov s lognormal model , e.g. , violation of novikov s inequality@xcite for scaling exponents .",
    "still exists a possibility that small - scale intermittency is affected by large - scale fluctuations .",
    "the study of this possibility is desirable .",
    "there were no studies of statistics among segments with large @xmath58 .",
    "hence , we have focused on grid turbulence , which is simple and thus serves as a standard . for flows other than grid turbulence",
    ", the fluctuations of statistics among segments are expected to be significant as well .",
    "in fact , regardless of the flow configuration and the reynolds number , the large - scale fluctuation of @xmath76 is significant.@xcite those fluctuations are also expected to have lognormal distributions and mutual correlations as observed here because they are due to the energy transfer in turbulence itself .",

    "local values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent local regions of actual turbulence , and they are continuously connected up to largest scales . throughout the scales , @xmath35 and @xmath36 obtained here are consistent with those measured at a certain time in spatially homogeneous but temporally decaying turbulence ( see appendix of ref . ) .",
