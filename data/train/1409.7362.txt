    "stars and black holes can accrete gas when they move through a gaseous medium ( bondi & hoyle 1944 ) . gas accretion may shape the observed initial mass function of stars in young star - forming clusters ( e.g. , bonnell et al . 2001 ; maschberger et al . 2014 ) .",
    "in addition to the aerodynamic drag force @xmath1 due to the accretion of gas , gravitational objects moving in a gas may also feel a drag or dynamical friction due to the gravitational interaction with its own - induced wake .",
    "there is a variety of astrophysical systems where gas dynamical friction plays an important role ;",
    "e.g. , gas dynamical friction is relevant to understand the orbital decay of common - envelope binary stars ( taam & sandquist 2000 ; nordhaus & blackman 2006 ; ricker & taam 2008 ) , the orbital decay of giant clumps in high - redshift galaxies ( immeli et al .",
    "2004 ; bournaud et al .",
    "2007 ) or the shrinkage of the orbit of supermassive black holes in merging galaxies ( e.g. , armitage & natarajan 2002 ) .",
    "dynamical friction may affect the stellar dynamics in star clusters still embedded in their parent gas cloud , and/or a nuclear star cluster subject to major gas inflows ( e.g. , davies et al .",
    "for instance , chavarra et al . (",
    "2010 ) suggested that the mass segregation observed in two clusters of young stellar objects associated with massive star - forming regions in the norma spiral arm could be explained by the migration of high - mass stars toward the center due to gaseous gravitational drag .",
    "leigh et al . ( 2014 ) found that for the galactic nuclei and young star - forming regions considered in their study , the rate of mass segregation due to gas dynamical friction and accretion tends to be comparable to , albeit slightly smaller than , the rates from stellar two - body relaxation .",
    "thus , gas damping can accelerate the rate of mass segregation .",
    "in the work , we consider the problem of the orbital evolution of binaries embedded in gaseous media , e.g. , in a cloud .",
    "dynamical friction will lead to a migration of the binary to the center of the cloud , producing mass segregation .",
    "in addition , dynamical interaction with the surrounding gas may produce a braking torque , which can lead to the extraction of energy and angular momentum from the binary ( kim et al .",
    "2008 ; stahler 2010 ) .",
    "this torque tends to shrink the separation of the binary components , decreasing its orbital period around the center of mass of the binary .",
    "korntreff et al .",
    "( 2012 ) argued that during the time that the cluster is embedded in its natal gas ( @xmath2 myr ) , the gas - induced orbital decay can reshape the period distribution in close systems ( separations @xmath3 au ) .",
    "moreover , they suggested that gas damping can catalyse the coalescence of star binaries , reducing the binary frequency .",
    "one would expect that , since binary systems are , on average , more massive than single stars , they should present a more clear signature of mass segregation .",
    "contrary to these expectations , de grijs et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and li et al .",
    "( 2013 ) showed evidence that the fraction of f - star binary systems in ngc 1818 increases with increasing distance from the cluster center .",
    "this could be indicative that either the dynamical friction is reduced in binary systems or , more likely , that they are observing hard binary systems ( those with relatively high binding energies compared to the kinetic energy of bulk stellar population ) that have survived and could have been hardened by dynamical encounters and by gas dynamical friction .",
    "geller et al . ( 2013 ) found that , depending on the dynamical age of the cluster , the radial binary frequency distribution can either increase or decrease moving out radially from the cluster center , due to the combined effects of binary disruption and mass segregation .",
    "gas dynamical friction is also an important ingredient to understand the orbital decay of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies ( e.g. , armitage & natarajan 2002 ; see colpi 2014 for a review ) .",
    "it is believed that all galaxies with stellar spheroids possess a supermassive black hole .",
    "thus , a merger of two galaxies leads to the formation of a supermassive black hole binary .",
    "if the timescale for coalescence of the black holes in the binary is longer than the time for succesive major mergers , then the galaxy may undergo a subsequent merger when the binary is still in place ( hoffman & loeb 2007 ; amaro - seoane et al .",
    "2010 ; kulbarni & loeb 2012 ) . when a galaxy with a binary black hole merges with other galaxy that contains a central black hole , their black holes sink to the center of the merger product by dynamical friction , forming a triple black hole system .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to understand the orbital decay of the center - of - mass of a binary black hole , due to dynamical friction , in the aftermath of a gas - rich merger .",
    "in addition to the orbital decay towards the center of the remnant , the binary is subject to loss of angular momentum about its center of mass , which means the separation between the components of the binary shrinks .",
    "note that black hole binaries are expected to be surrounded by a rotating stellar and gaseous disk , resulting from the merger of the two parent disks .",
    "the associated drag depends on the differential rotation of the disk , its self - gravity and on the presence of resonances .",
    "therefore , models that assume that the background is initially uniform and static can not be applied to study the orbital decay of black hole binaries in the center of galaxies .",
    "the orbital decay of a _ single _ perturber orbiting a gaseous cloud was studied numerically by snchez - salcedo & brandenburg ( 2001 ) and by escala et al .",
    "snchez - salcedo & brandenburg ( 2001 ) found that an extension of the analytical formula derived by ostriker ( 1999 ) for perturbers in rectilinear orbit and constant velocity in homogeneous media , is very successful in describing the orbital evolution .",
    "escala et al .",
    "( 2004 ) provided a fitting formula for the decay timescale of a massive perturber in a self - gravitating isothermal sphere .",
    "cant et al .",
    "( 2013 ) derived a formula for the gravitational drag on a body moving in a vertically stratified medium of gas .",
    "kim , kim & snchez - salcedo ( 2008 ) considered an embedded - gas binary and derived the braking forces on each particle assuming that the two components of the binary are on circular orbits .",
    "stahler ( 2010 ) studied the same problem but used a different approach to estimate the angular momentum exchange between the binary and the surrounding gas . in both calculations",
    ", it was assumed that the center - of - mass of the binary is at rest relative to the gaseous medium .",
    "the goal of this paper is to derive the drag forces and internal torques acting on a binary system in a more general situation in which the binary system is moving relative to the surrounding medium .",
    "we will see that the morphology of the wake , the drag force and the internal torques are modified , in a subtle manner , when the additional component of the center - of - mass velocity is included .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : formulation ] , we present the mathematical framework to derive the gravitational wake excited by a binary system , using time - dependent linear perturbation theory .",
    "estimates of the length scale at which the response of the gas departs from linearity are also discussed in section [ sec : formulation ] . since in linear theory the wake created by two perturbers is given by the simple superposition of the wakes of both perturbers , section [ sec : wake ] describes the morphology of the resulting wake created by just one component of the binary . in section [ sec : drag ] , we evaluate the drag foce on the perturber due to its own wake . in section [ sec : equalmass ] we provide estimates of the drag forces and internal torques in equal - mass binaries and outline how to determine the binary orbital evolution .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "consider a self - gravitating bound system whose center of mass moves at a velocity @xmath0 relative to the gaseous background .",
    "the system could be a globular cluster orbiting the gaseous halo of a protogalaxy , a star cluster in the gaseous disk of a galaxy , or a binary star embedded in its progenitor cloud . to make the presentation readeable",
    ", we will consider the context of a binary system , but our approach and results are also valid and applicable in many other astrophysical scenarios .",
    "we will compute the response of the gaseous medium to the gravitational potential created by a binary system that travels in a linear trajectory through an initially homogeneous medium with density and sound speed at infinity @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively . as usual in studies of dynamical friction",
    ", we will assume that the orbital parameters of the binary are constant over time , i.e. we ignore the effect of the drag force on the orbit .",
    "without loss of generality , we assume that the center of mass of the binary moves along the @xmath6-axis with velocity @xmath7 , that is , @xmath8 . in the binary frame ,",
    "the two particles move in a plane ; we will refer to it as the orbital plane .",
    "denote @xmath9 as the inclination angle of the orbit ( where @xmath9 is assumed to lie between @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , i.e. the angle between the vector perpendicular to the orbital plane and @xmath0 . when @xmath12 , the orbital axis is aligned with the velocity of the center of mass and , thus",
    ", the binary moves face - on relative to the ambient medium . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath13 corresponds to an edge - on motion .",
    "finally , we define a unit vector @xmath14 along the intersection of the orbital plane with the reference plane @xmath15 . we can always choose a system of reference where @xmath14 is along the @xmath16-axis ( that is",
    ", the longitude of the ascending node is zero ) .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case where the orbit of the binary is circular , and focus on the wake created by one of the components of the binary , with mass @xmath17 ( hereafter the perturber ) .",
    "we let @xmath18 denote the radius of its orbit around the center of mass of the binary . in the frame of reference described above",
    ", the orbit is given by @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 where we have assumed that , at @xmath22 , the perturber is at @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 and , in addition , for convention , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "0.75 cm    the gas will respond to the external gravitational potential created by the perturber , @xmath28 , which obeys the poisson equation @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the density profile of the perturber . in our case : @xmath31 where we are assuming that the perturber is a point - mass . here",
    "@xmath32 is an arbitrary function of @xmath33 which may be used to describe how the perturber is introduced in the medium ; @xmath34 corresponds to the stationary state , where the perturber is present since @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath32 is the heaviside function , @xmath36 the perturber is dropped suddently at @xmath22 , whereas if @xmath37)\\theta(t)$ ] , the perturber is inserted adiabatically when @xmath38 is large enough .",
    "ostriker ( 1999 ) noticed that for subsonic perturbers , the stationary solution does not capture all the physics of the problem .",
    "it is useful to define the mach number of the center of mass @xmath39 and the orbital mach number defined as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "a model can thus be specified with three dimensionless parameters @xmath42 .",
    "discussions are more simple in the case where @xmath12 because the modulus of the velocity of each perturber is constant . for @xmath43 ,",
    "the relative velocity between one perturber and the ambient medium depends on the position along the orbit , which complicates the treatment .",
    "therefore , we will focus on the face - on case ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "consider for a moment the wake created by just one object of mass @xmath17 that is forced to move in a helical motion without any other gravitational companion .",
    "if the perturber is a point - mass , there exists a neighbourhood around the body where the response of the gas becomes nonlinear .",
    "let us denote @xmath44 the radius of this region . when the guiding center moves subsonically , @xmath45 , the response of the gas is nonlinear within the bondi radius , @xmath46 , defined as the distance at which the gravitational potential is comparable to the gas pressure , that is @xmath47 .",
    "now suppose that the motion of the guiding center is supersonic : @xmath48 .",
    "it is convenient to define the gravitational radius @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath50 , then curvature effects of the orbit are not important and , therefore , the response becomes nonlinear within the accretion radius , @xmath51 , which corresponds to the accretion radius of a body in rectilinear orbit with effective mach number @xmath52 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath53 , the orbit is so close that its size and the orbital velocity @xmath54 are both irrelevant . under this condition , the problem is nonlinear at distances @xmath55 ( i.e. , @xmath56 ) .",
    "since @xmath57 and @xmath58 are both proportional to @xmath17 , @xmath44 also depends on @xmath17 . hence , @xmath44 can be arbitrarily small by decreasing the value of @xmath17",
    ".    in the presence of a companion , it is necessary to compute @xmath44 for each constituent of the binary , say @xmath59 and @xmath60 . if @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the separation of the binary , the nonlinear parts of the wakes do not intersect .",
    "thus , the fluid is nonlinear in regions near each perturber with characteristic radii @xmath63 and @xmath64 . for unequal - mass binaries with @xmath65 ,",
    "the condition @xmath61 is satisfied either when @xmath66 and @xmath45 , or when @xmath67 .    now consider an equal - mass binary , each component having mass @xmath17 .",
    "the value of @xmath18 and the orbital velocity are not independent but related through @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 . the bondi radius of the binary , which has total mass @xmath70 , is @xmath71 .",
    "consequently , if @xmath72 , then @xmath73 .",
    "this means that if @xmath45 and @xmath72 , the flow is in the nonlinear regime within a sphere of radius @xmath74 around the binary .",
    "if , on the other hand , the center of mass of an equal - mass binary moves supersonically at , say @xmath75 , then @xmath76 . as a result ,",
    "for @xmath77 , the flow becomes nonlinear in regions of size smaller than @xmath18 near each component of the binary .",
    "following these arguments , we have constructed figure [ fig : parameter_space ] , which shows contour lines of @xmath44 in the plane @xmath78 for an equal - mass binary . in section [",
    "sec : wake ] , we calculate the wake for @xmath79 and @xmath80 ranging between @xmath81 and @xmath82 . as we see in figure",
    "[ fig : parameter_space ] , @xmath44 may be as small as @xmath83 in the limit case that @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , _ in equal - mass binaries _ and for the parameters selected in this investigation , the linear approximation theory definitely breaks down at distances less than @xmath86 from the perturber , or even at larger distances for other combinations of @xmath78 .      in the previous section (  [ sec : scales ] ) , we have estimated the characteristic scales at which the flow becomes nonlinear . far enough from the gravitational object ,",
    "the perturbation is so small that it can be treated in the linear approximation . combining the linearized equation of continuity and the linearized equation of motion , it is straightforward to find the differential equation for @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the gas density of the medium .",
    "the governing equation for @xmath89 reads @xmath90 which corresponds to the inhomogeneous wave equation ( e.g. , ostriker 1999 ) .",
    "the formal solution of this equation is given by : @xmath91 \\rho_{\\rm ext}({\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}',t')}{|{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}-{\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}}'|}. \\label{eq : formal_solution}\\ ] ] for a point - mass perturber in a straight - line orbit ( i.e. @xmath92 ) , equation ( [ eq : formal_solution ] ) can be integrated analytically ( ostriker 1999 ) . here",

    "kim & kim ( 2007 ) studied the gravitational wake created by a perturber on a pure circular orbit .",

    "the overdensity @xmath125 is the same as described in kim & kim ( 2007 ) . for the selected set of parameters @xmath42",
    ", we construct a grid . at a given time @xmath126 ,",
    "we find numerically the roots of equation ( [ eq : roots_gen ] ) at each point of the grid @xmath127 , using the newton - raphson bisection method .",
    "appendix [ sec : app_location ] establishes the procedure to find the interval where the roots are located .",
    "once the roots are found , we evaluate equation ( [ eqn : dgen ] ) to find @xmath128 .",
    "one of the advantages of the semi - analytical approach is that @xmath129 can be derived at the desired degree of accuracy .",
    "in addition , we can compute @xmath129 at a time @xmath126 without the need to follow its evolution at all intermediate timesteps , as occurs when solving numerically a differential equation .",
    "since the problem is transformed into an algebraic one , the density can be computed pixel - by - pixel , allowing to distribute the work in different processors or machines and thereby achieving very high - resolution in modest desktop computers .",
    "we must stress again that the linear approximation does not capture correctly the structure of the flow in a neighbourhood of the body where @xmath130 . indeed , the structure of the flow in the non - linear region depends on whether the perturber is modeled as a perfect accretor or , on the opposite case , it is modeled as a non - divergent core gravitational potential .",
    "we specialize in the case where the perturber is introduced at @xmath22 .",
    "this corresponds to take @xmath36 , where @xmath131 is the heaviside step function , so that at @xmath132 the medium is unperturbed . as a result ,",
    "the summation in equation ( [ eq : d_general ] ) is only over positive roots ( that is , only roots @xmath133 contribute in equation [ eq : d_general ] ) ; in fact , @xmath32 defines the region that sound waves launched at @xmath22 have time to reach .",
    "the temporal evolution of the wake created by a perturber in a pure circular orbit , i. e. @xmath124 , was described in full detail in kim & kim ( 2007 ) . due to the orbit curvature , the wake tail bends behind the perturber , creating spiral waves . as illustrated by kim & kim ( 2007 ) , the thickness of the spiral waves and their level of winding depend on the orbital mach number .",
    "here we consider the case where @xmath0 is nonzero .",
    "as said in section [ sec : orbit ] , when @xmath12 , the orbital plane is perpendicular to @xmath0 and the body describes a helical trajectory .",
    "it is interesting to compare the morphologies of the wakes created by perturbers in helical motion with those created by perturbers in circular orbit .",
    "figure [ fig : mu_subsonic ] shows the dimensionless density @xmath129 at @xmath105 ( remind that the time unit is @xmath119 ) , when @xmath134 for two values of @xmath80 ( @xmath10 and @xmath135 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the structure of the density wake presents a comma - like shape at the plane of the orbit , i.e. at @xmath136 when @xmath124 and at @xmath137 when @xmath138 .",
    "since the perturbers move subsonically ( @xmath139 ) in both cases , they always lie in the interior of the sonic sphere .",
    "close enough to the perturber , at distances @xmath140 , a spheroidal envelope is formed around the perturber . at larger distances from the perturber ,",
    "the disturbance forms a trailing one - armed spiral wave .",
    "this one - armed disturbance ends at the sonic sphere .",
    "the density maps in the @xmath141-plane that contains the perturber , look like qualitatively similar in both cases . in these maps ,",
    "the perturbations are confined to a circle of radius @xmath142 in the plane @xmath136 , and to a circle of radius @xmath143 in the plane @xmath137 .",
    "these circles are obtained as the intersection of the sonic sphere , which is centered at the initial position of the perturber and has a radius of @xmath142 , with the planes @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the density maps along vertical cuts are remarkably different . for @xmath124 ,",
    "the density perturbation is symmetric with respect to the plane @xmath25 .",
    "this symmetry is broken when the perturber moves in the vertical direction ; an elongated overdense structure can be observed in the cut along a vertical plane when @xmath138 .",
    "the morphology of the wake changes dramatically for the perturber moves supersonically in the vertical direction . in the extreme case where @xmath48 and @xmath144",
    ", a mach cone is formed behind the perturber .",
    "however , because of the orbital motion , the axis of the mach cone is not a straight line , as occurs in the rectilinear case , but follows a helicoidal curve .",
    "this occurs , for instance , for @xmath134 and @xmath145 ( not shown ) .    now consider the case where the orbital motion is supersonic @xmath146 .",
    "for @xmath124 , the gravitational disturbance leads to the formation of an one - arm trailing tail that wraps around the perturber ( see kim & kim 2007 ) .",
    "the radial separation between two consecutive spiral crests is @xmath147 .",
    "figures [ fig : muorb2_horizontal ] and [ fig : muorb2_vertical ] display the density disturbance for @xmath148 and different @xmath80-values , along horizontal and vertical planes , respectively .",
    "when the perturber moves in the vertical direction , it is easy to identify the corresponding spiral wave fronts , more clearly in cuts along @xmath149const planes , as long as @xmath45 . for supersonic motions in the vertical direction ( @xmath48 ) , the morphology of the wake changes remarkably ( see the fourth panel in figure [ fig : muorb2_vertical ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : muorb2_vertical ] also shows the transversal structure of the spiral waves , which appear as long arcs ( for @xmath45 ) . for @xmath150 , the spiral wave fronts are bunched up closer together at @xmath151 ( i.e. at @xmath152 in physical units ) , especially for @xmath153 , because of the vertical motion of the perturber .",
    "since we have selected vertical cuts that pass through the position of the perturber , we can see the mach cone at the rear of the perturber , at distances @xmath154 from it .",
    "indeed , the mach cone is formed because the perturber moves supersonically relative to the background .    when @xmath155 , the vertical distribution of the wake is very complex , with many overdense substructures . however , the overall density perturbation is confined within the large - scale rear mach cone , defined by @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the cylindrical distance ( see appendix [ sec : app_location ] ) . in fact , the perturber launches sound waves to the medium that necessarily must lie within the large - scale mach cone to preserve the causality condition .",
    "the total mach number @xmath158 is constant along the orbit of the perturber only when @xmath12 .",
    "otherwise , the total mach number varies with the perturber s angular distance @xmath159 measured in the orbital plane , defined as @xmath160 ( see eqs .",
    "[ eq : xp]-[eq : zp ] ) . in this section",
    ", we will focus on the edge - on orbit , @xmath13 .",
    "in such a case , @xmath161 at any time .",
    "the body moves in the plane @xmath24 on an epicycle , which in turn moves along the @xmath6-axis .",
    "the maximum total mach number is @xmath162 and occurs when @xmath163 ( with @xmath164 an integer ) .",
    "the minimum total mach number is @xmath165 at @xmath166 .",
    "figure [ fig : d_edgeon ] shows the map of the density disturbance in the plane @xmath24 for different combinations of @xmath80 and @xmath79 .",
    "we see that when @xmath167 , that is , when the motion of the perturber is always subsonic , a comma - type wave , similar to that found in the face - on case with @xmath168 , is formed .",
    "it is remarkable that when @xmath138 and @xmath148 , a spiral wave also emerges , as occurs in the face - on orbit , but now the thickness of the spiral wave clearly varies with @xmath6 , being thicker at @xmath169 and thinner at @xmath170 .",
    "this can be interpreted as follows .",
    "the spiral sound waves moves radially outwards at a velocity @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the relative velocity between the perturber and the spiral waves in the radial direction varies with the azimuthal angle @xmath171 , from @xmath172 at @xmath173 , to @xmath174 , at @xmath175 .",
    "this asymmetry is responsible for the asymmetric thickness of the spiral waves found when @xmath146 and @xmath45 .    when @xmath145 and @xmath134 , the velocity of the perturber along the @xmath6-direction is always supersonic and , hence , the perturber is always at the apex of the deformed mach cone .",
    "the overall structure of the wake resembles the wake of a supersonic body in the straight - line trajectory case but now the mach cone is deformed because of the epicyclic motion and also because the total mach number is not constant but varies between @xmath176 and @xmath177 along one epicycle .",
    "the structure of the wake is very complex when @xmath80 and @xmath79 are both larger than @xmath178 and comparable in magnitude . as an example",
    ", we show the case for @xmath179 .",
    "the total mach number oscillates between @xmath10 and @xmath180 .",
    "density disturbances lag the perturber when it moves at the highest total mach number ( @xmath180 in this case ) , which occurs at @xmath181 .",

    "we have considered the dynamical friction in the context of a binary system but our analysis may be extended to study other astrophysical situations where the perturbers do not move on rectilinear orbits . in particular , we have provided the mathematical framework to study the gravitational interaction of a binary system with its surrounding gas , when it moves through a uniform , static gaseous background , in linear theory .",
    "we have shown how the presence of a binary ( instead of a single point - mass ) and of the additional component center - of - mass velocity modifies the morphology of the density wake and the nature of the drag force .",
    "we have also quantified the internal torques .    using time - dependent linear perturbation theory ,",
    "we have developed a semi - analytical scheme to derive the enhanced - density wake created by a binary system .",
    "the method is an extension of the work of kim & kim ( 2007 ) .",
    "we have first examined the gravitational wake excited in the medium by just one component of the binary .",
    "this facilitates comparison with previous studies that consider one single perturber . for simplicity",
    ", we have assumed that it is on a circular orbit about the center of mass of the binary .",
    "a model is specified with three dimensionless parameters : @xmath80 ( the mach number associated with the center of mass ) , @xmath79 ( the mach number of the orbital motion ) and @xmath9 the angle between the orbital axis and @xmath0 .",
    "we have characterized the wake and computed the drag forces in two cases : when the orbital plane is perpendicular to @xmath0 ( face - on case ) and when they are parallel ( edge - on case ) .",
    "the morphology of the wake depends on whether the motions are supersonic or subsonic .",
    "if both are subsonic ( i.e. @xmath45 and @xmath66 ) , the perturbed density is confined to the sonic sphere centered in the initial position of the perturber . within the sonic sphere",
    ", the perturbed density distribution displays a smooth comma - shape tail along cuts parallel and perpendicular to the orbital plane . when @xmath45 and @xmath146 , the perturber torques the gas and launches spiral trailing waves which transport angular momentum . finally , when @xmath48 and @xmath146 , the wake displays a very complicated structure , unless @xmath80 and @xmath79 are very different in magnitude .",
    "if @xmath365 , the perturbed density distribution is confined within a deformed mach cone .    we have computed the drag forces that arise from the gravitational attraction between the perturber and the wake it excites in the ambient medium .",
    "we have compared the drag force in the @xmath6-direction with that prediced using the ostriker formula which was derived for a body in rectilinear orbit .",
    "if the perturber moves at @xmath48 , the dynamical friction force in the @xmath6-direction is reduced as compared to the rectilinear case because of the loss of gravitational focusing of gas behind the perturber , due to the orbital motion . however ,",
    "if @xmath45 , the @xmath6-component of the drag force may be larger than in the pure rectilinear case for certain values of @xmath79 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath12 , @xmath138 , @xmath235 and @xmath218 , the @xmath6-component of the drag force is several times larger than it is in the pure rectilinear case ( @xmath227 ) .",
    "we have also investigated the azimuthal component of the drag force , which causes the binary to lose orbital angular momentum .",
    "we have found that kim & kim ( 2007 ) formula provides reasonable estimates of @xmath220 as long as @xmath239 or @xmath366 . in the face - on case",
    ", we find that , at a fixed value of @xmath79 larger than @xmath178 , @xmath220 decreases with increasing @xmath80 . as illustration , for @xmath235 , @xmath220 is a factor of @xmath249 smaller for @xmath248 than it is for @xmath124 .",
    "however , for @xmath66 , @xmath220 versus @xmath80 presents a maximum around @xmath367 .",
    "therefore , it is misleading to think that the translational motion of the center of mass always leads to a decrease in @xmath220 .",
    "our analysis is especially relevant to understand the gas - induced effects on binary stars when they are still embedded in their parent cloud , or in a central stellar cluster that is undergoing a major inflow of gas ( e.g. , davies et al .",
    "dynamical friction may cause orbital migration of the binary towards the center of the cloud , leading to mass segregation .",
    "in addition , the binary can shrink by the tidal torque created by its own wake , reducing its orbital period .",
    "we have compared the braking torque acting on an equal - mass binary at rest relative to the ambient medium with that using the analytical formula derived by stahler ( 2010 ) .",
    "we find that stahler s formula overestimates the torque .",
    "for instance , for @xmath238 , stahler s formula overestimates the torque by two orders of magnitude .",
    "we conclude that the analysis made by korntreff et al .",
    "( 2012 ) should be revised using the correct magnitude for the torques and including the translational motion of the binaries .",
