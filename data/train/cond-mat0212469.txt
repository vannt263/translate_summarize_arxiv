    "one of the oldest and best studied models of networks which have the merit of being exactly solvable for many of their properties , are the random graphs of erds and rnyi @xcite .",
    "these graphs consist of @xmath0 nodes any two of which are connected with a probability @xmath1 and left unconnected with a probability @xmath2 .",
    "many of the properties of these networks can be easily derived by analytical means . among them",
    "are the degree distribution of nodes , which turns out to be poissonian , the average shortest path between any two nodes which is of the order of @xmath3 , and the onset of phase transition for developing a giant component which happens as @xmath1 exceeds a certain critical value .",
    "+ despite their exact solvability and their low diameter , these networks lack some of the other crucial properties of real life networks . in particular it is well known that many real networks e.g. world wide web , social networks , power grids , scientific and artistic collaborations , neural and metabolic networks , show clustering or transitivity which is absent in erds and rnyi graphs .",
    "moreover many real networks do not possess poissonian degree distribution and intensive studies have been made to construct models as close as to real networks @xcite and to study dynamic effects , e.g. spreading of a contact effect , on them.@xcite .",
    "+ in the past few years an elegant theory has been developed to construct random graphs with desirable degree distributions to mimic the degree properties of real networks .",
    "it appears that bender and canfield @xcite have been the first to propose an algorithm for constructing a random graph with a specific degree distribution",
    ". we will call the ensemble of graphs constructed in this way the bender canfield ensemble .",
    "it is remarkable that these graphs are still exactly solvable to a large extent @xcite .",
    "however these graphs still have two shortcomings .",
    "first they do not show correlation in the degree of nearest neighbors and second their clustering coefficient vanishes in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "+ it is important that the degree distribution does not determine by itself the existence or lack of correlations . for a specific degree distribution one may have or have not correlations .",
    "moreover , it has been observed that correlation is an essential feature of real networks which can appear in different forms @xcite .",
    "for instance , a high degree node may be connected to other high degree nodes(associative mixing ) , to low degree nodes(dissociative mixing ) or with equal probability to both types ( neutral mixing ) with different resulting behaviors in networks @xcite .",
    "+ for this reason algorithms have been developed to produce correlated networks with certain degree distribution @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we will suggest a simple deterministic transformation on the bender canfield ( bc ) graphs and show that the transformed graphs are both correlated and clustered in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "given a bc graph @xmath4 with @xmath0 nodes and a degree distribution @xmath5 , we construct a graph @xmath6 by assigning nodes to each edge of @xmath4 .",
    "we then connect these new nodes if the corresponding edges in @xmath4 have had a common node in @xmath4 .",
    "we show that many of the properties of these transformed networks can be obtained exactly or almost exactly .",
    "we obtain general formulas for the degree distribution and its correlations for the transformed graphs and will obtain also formulas for the clustering coefficients of these new graphs . as examples",
    "we apply our transformation to bender canfield graphs with various degree distributions .",
    "+ it has been shown by newman that percolation on bc graphs can be solved by a generating function method .",
    "the method is applicable due to the fact that in these graphs there is no clustering . by applying our transformation to these graphs",
    "we can follow similar steps and solve percolation on @xmath6 .",
    "the interesting point is that now @xmath6 is a highly clustered graph for which we can solve percolation .",
    "+ the paper is structured as follows : in section [ 2 ] we give a brief review of bender canfield ensemble of random graphs having arbitrary degree distributions . in section",
    "[ 3 ] we discuss our transformation and derive various properties of general transformed graphs . in section",
    "[ 4 ] we apply our general formulas to graphs with degree distributions of poissonian , scale free and exponential types .",
    "we end the paper with a conclusion .",
    "let @xmath4 denote a graph with @xmath0 edges and @xmath7 links .",
    "let also the degree distribution of this graph be given by the function @xmath5 , that is the fraction of nodes with @xmath8 neighbors be given by @xmath9 .",
    "there is an algorithm @xcite for constructing graphs whose degree distribution corresponds to @xmath5 for large @xmath0 .",
    "more specifically given a degree sequence @xmath10 corresponding to the desired degree distribution @xmath5 , one takes each node @xmath11 with @xmath12 loose ends ( stubs ) and then connects each pair of stubs randomly until no loose end remains .",
    "we call these types of graphs bender - canfield or simply bc graphs",
    ". thus we speak of poissonian bc graphs or scale free bc graphs to designate the degree distribution used for their construction .",
    "+ many of the properties of bc graphs can be calculated exactly .",
    "for example the average number of first neighbors of an arbitrary node , denoted by @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 it is useful to call a node with @xmath8 emanating edges a node of type @xmath8",
    ". then the probability of picking up a node of type @xmath8 is given by @xmath5 .",
    "we can now ask a different question : what is the probability @xmath15 of picking up an _ edge _ which belongs to a node of type @xmath16 . this is equal to the fraction of stubs coming out of nodes of type @xmath16 : @xmath17 if we now follow a link to one of its ends the average number of new links ( the average ratio of the number of second to the first neighbors of an arbitrary node @xmath18 ) will be given by @xmath19 as we will see this quantity will play a central role in many of the later derivations . + we can ask yet another question . what is the probability @xmath20 of picking up an edge which is common to a node of type @xmath16 and a node of type @xmath21 ? .",
    "this probability is given by a product which is a reflection of the absence of correlations in these networks , @xmath22 one can also calculate the clustering coefficient of these graphs .",
    "the result is @xcite @xmath23 it is important to note that for many kinds of degree distributions ( i.e. those with finite @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , this clustering coefficient vanishes in the limit of large graph size @xmath0 .",
    "it can also be shown that the ratio @xmath18 controls the existence of an infinite cluster of connected nodes @xcite for these graphs .",
    "for @xmath26 there is an infinite cluster where the average distance between two arbitrary nodes , is of order @xmath27 .",
    "recently it has been found that almost all pairs of nodes have the same distance in this cluster @xcite .",
    "+ it will be convenient to define two generating functions for the bc ensemble corresponding to a degree distribution : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and in the last relation we have used ( [ q(k ) ] ) . in terms of these generating functions ,",
    "the average number of first neighbors @xmath13 and second neighbors @xmath24 are simply given by @xmath30",
    "consider a bc graph @xmath4 with @xmath0 nodes with a degree sequence @xmath31 taken from a distribution @xmath9 .",
    "we can transform this graph to a new graph @xmath32 as follows . to each link of the original graph",
    ", we assign a node of the new graph .",
    "we connect any two nodes of the new graph if the corresponding links in the original graph have a node in common , see fig.([fig-1 ] ) .",
    "the number of nodes and links of @xmath6 denoted respectively by @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively are determined from the degree distribution of @xmath4 .",
    "we note that each node of type @xmath8 of @xmath4 contributes @xmath8 nodes and @xmath35 edges to @xmath6 .",
    "taking care of the fact that the new nodes are counted twice we find :     and empty circles and dashed lines belong to @xmath6.,width=491,height=377 ]    @xmath36    as figure ( [ fig-2]-a ) shows the degree distribution of the new graph @xmath32 is given by : @xmath37 which is nothing but the probability that an arbitrary edge in @xmath4 is connected to a total of @xmath8 edges at its two end point nodes . +",
    "there are simple relations between the generating functions of @xmath4 and @xmath6 . using ( [ pk ] )",
    "we find :    @xmath38    from this last equation we find @xmath39 in view of ( [ gf1 ] ) we have @xmath40    .",
    "b ) second neighbors of a node in @xmath6 ( reachable from one of its sides).,width=642,height=377 ]     and @xmath41 in @xmath6 are correlated by the vertex @xmath42 in @xmath4.,width=566,height=377 ]    however since the graph @xmath6 is a clustered graph as we will see , the ratio of average number of second to first neighbors of an arbitrary node , @xmath43 is not given by the expression @xmath44 as in ( [ z2/z1 ] ) .",
    "instead we resort to a direct counting . as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig-2]-b ) if we follow a node of @xmath6 to the right , the number of first neighbors that we find is given by @xmath18 inherited from @xmath4 .",
    "due to the low clustering of @xmath4 , the number of second neighbors that we will meet will be @xmath45 .",
    "thus the total number of second neighbors will be twice this value , that is @xmath46 .",
    "the above reasoning indeed shows that @xmath47 which in turn means that the conditions @xcite for the development of a giant component in @xmath4 and@xmath32 are identical .",
    "+ we now find the probability @xmath48 of finding an edge the end nodes of which have @xmath8 and @xmath49 other neighbors .",
    "+ looking at figure ( [ fig-3 ] ) , the probability of finding an edge like @xmath50 in @xmath6 is equivalent to finding two edges @xmath51 and @xmath52 incident on the same node @xmath42 in @xmath4 . for a moment",
    "suppose that no other edge in @xmath4 is incident on @xmath42 .",
    "then it is clear from figure ( [ fig-3 ] ) that the nodes @xmath53 and @xmath41 will have @xmath16 and @xmath21 neighbors in @xmath6 if the nodes @xmath54 and @xmath55 will have @xmath16 and @xmath21 neighbors in @xmath4 respectively . putting this together",
    "we find that in this simple case @xmath56 , where @xmath57 comes from the probability of finding a node like @xmath42 of degree @xmath58 in @xmath4 .",
    "in general the node @xmath42 may be common to @xmath59 other edges in @xmath4 .",
    "these extra edges contribute to the total number of neighbors of @xmath53 and @xmath41 , so that in order for the node @xmath53 to have a total of @xmath16 neighbors in @xmath6 , the node @xmath54 needs only have @xmath60 neighbors in @xmath4 .",
    "a similar statement is true also for the node @xmath41 . thus instead of the factor @xmath61 we will have @xmath62 .",
    "this should be multiplied by the probability of finding a triplet @xmath63 which is proportional to @xmath64 and finally summed over @xmath59 .",
    "the final result is @xmath65 in this way correlations are introduced into the graph in the sense that @xmath20 is no longer equal to @xmath66 . + it is also possible to calculate the clustering coefficient of @xmath6 .",
    "it is clear that an edge with end point nodes of degree @xmath67 and @xmath68 in @xmath4 represents a node of degree @xmath69 in @xmath6 .",
    "thus the total number of potential connections among these first neighbors is @xmath70 . of these possible connections ,",
    "there are already a number of @xmath71 connections present coming from the definition of @xmath6 . due to the clustering coefficient of @xmath4",
    ", there are configurations which increase this number for finite graphs .",
    "however since in the thermodynamic limit we know that the bc graphs have vanishing clustering coefficients we need not worry about these contributions .",
    "thus in the thermodynamic limit we have the following formula for clustering coefficient of @xmath6 :    @xmath72    in this way our transformation has introduced a finite clustering coefficient into the bc ensemble of graphs . in the next section",
    "we will apply this transformation to several well known ensembles with specific degree distributions , namely the poisson , scale free and exponential ensembles . + finally let us consider percolation on @xmath6 . for the sake of simplicity , here we consider only site percolation but the same analysis can be applied to bond percolation as well .",
    "let each node of @xmath73 be occupied with probability @xmath1 and denote the probability that an arbitrary node belongs to a cluster of size @xmath74 , by @xmath75 .",
    "the generating function of this probability is denoted by @xmath76 , that is @xmath77 . using the same procedure as in @xcite we write the following expression for @xmath78 : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the generating function for the number of nodes reachable",
    "if we follow the neighbors of the node in one of its sides say to the right ( i.e. if we follow the corresponding link on @xmath4 to the right ) ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig-2]-b ) ) . the expression for @xmath81",
    "is obtained recursively as @xmath82 solution of these two equations will give us the probabilities @xmath75 .",
    "for a poissonian distribution , where @xmath83 , it is readily verified using ( ) that @xmath84 .",
    "we find from ( [ pk ] ) that @xmath85 where in the last step we have used the binomial distribution .",
    "thus our transformation maps a poissonian graph to another poissonian graph , whose average degree is twice the original one .",
    "however this new graph is completely different from the original one in other respects .",
    "first there is correlations between the degree of neighbors and second it has a finite clustering coefficient even for large graphs ( as @xmath86 ) . to see this we use ( [ pkk ] ) to calculate for the specific case of @xmath87 , the difference @xmath88 as a function of @xmath8 for various values of @xmath89 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig-4]-a ) .",
    "figure ( [ fig-4]-b ) shows the clustering coefficient ( calculated from ( [ c ] ) ) as a function of @xmath90 .",
    "it is clearly seen in this and the other cases considered below that there are non - vanishing correlations in the degree distributions .",
    "also these transformed graphs have appreciable value of clustering .",
    "moreover it is seen that the clustering coefficient approaches a maximum value of nearly @xmath91 for large value of average connectivity .",
    "the reason is that , in this limit an appreciable fraction of the nodes of @xmath4 have a high degree approximately equal to @xmath13 , and thus one can estimate @xmath92 from ( [ c ] ) as @xmath93 .",
    "this explanation applies to the other examples discussed below .     for several values of @xmath90(here @xmath94 ) and b ) clustering coefficient.,width=566,height=302 ]      for scale free graphs we have @xmath95 where @xmath96 . from ( [ z1],[q(k ) ] ) we find @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we find from ( [ pk ] ) : @xmath99 it is seen that for @xmath100 the above sum is dominated by its first and last terms .",
    "thus for large @xmath8 , @xmath101 behaves like @xmath102 which in turn gives @xmath103 .",
    "thus the transformation maintains the power law behavior of degree distribution for large degrees . to see this behavior",
    "more precisely , we go to the continuum limit and convert the above sum into an integral which after a little rearrangement can be cast into the form : @xmath104^{1-\\gamma}\\ ] ] a change of variable @xmath105 turns this integral into the form @xmath106 where @xmath107 . as an example for the case @xmath108 we find @xmath109 which as expected , behaves like @xmath110 for large @xmath8 . like the previous example , we calculated numerically @xmath111 and @xmath92 .",
    "the results have been shown in figure ( [ fig-5 ] ) .     and",
    "b ) c for scale free graphs.,width=566,height=302 ]      finally , let us consider exponential distributions , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a normalizing factor .",
    "we find from ( [ q(k ) ] ) @xmath114 .",
    "using ( [ pk ] ) we find    @xmath115    converting the sum to integral , we find : @xmath116 we see that transformation does not change the cutoff value , @xmath117 , but produces some polynomial terms .",
    "+ in figure ( [ fig-6 ] ) we display the correlation and the clustering coefficient for this type of degree distribution , using equations ( [ pkk ] ) and ( [ c ] ) .     and b)c for exponential degree distribution.,width=566,height=302 ]",
    "we have introduced a transformation which when applied to an uncorrelated network with low clustering , produces a new correlated network with a considerable clustering . the small world property of the graph is not affected by this transformation , since the shortest path on two nodes of @xmath4 is almost the same as the shortest path on two incident links on these nodes on @xmath4 or two nodes on @xmath6 .",
    "we thus have a method to produce ensemble of graphs which resemble more closely the real networks while still being solvable in many respects .",
    "moreover it will be possible to use this transformation and solve dynamic processes on these new graphs .",
    "for example we have shown how site percolation can be solved on these transformed graphs .",
    "+ this transformation can also be applied to already correlated networks .",
    "moreover we have considered only the deterministic form of the transformation . in some cases it may be useful to introduce a stochastic parameter in the transformation to have more degree of freedom . that is the nodes of the transformed graph @xmath6 ,",
    "can be connected with a probability @xmath1 if the corresponding edges in @xmath4 have a common node .",
