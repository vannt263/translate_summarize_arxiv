    "extra dimensions were proposed almost a century ago in an attempt to unify gravity with electromagnetism .",
    "although that particular model of unification has fallen away , the proposal did raise a simple question : why are precisely three spatial dimensions observably large ?",
    "modern attempts at unification , notably supergravity and string theory , revived the idea of extra dimensions in a more promising context , but have left the question of  why three ? \" unanswered .",
    "what s more , these theories , together with recent astronomical measurements , have highlighted significant subtleties such as the need to stabilize the size of the extra dimensions and to drive periods of accelerated expansion of the large dimensions .",
    "one approach to these issues is to consider them part of the larger problem of string / m - theory vacuum degeneracy , and invoke anthropically motivated arguments .",
    "however , a more satisfying and convincing solution would be to find , for example , a dynamical mechanism that ensures three spatial dimensions grow while the others remain unobservably small .",
    "there have been a number of attempts along these lines within string / m - theory but to date these proposals have fallen short of the mark .",
    "we suggest here that casimir energies may play an important role in addressing these questions .",
    "related observations have been pursued in various guises in earlier works .",
    "as is well known , whenever there are dimensions whose spatial extent is finite , there are contributions to a purely quantum mechanical energy density @xcite that results from the boundary conditions imposed on a finite space .",
    "we argue that if this casimir energy has certain features , then it is possible , at least in toy models , to ( 1 ) stabilize the extra dimensions , ( 2 ) allow three dimensions to grow large , and ( 3 ) provide an effective dark energy in the large dimensions .",
    "it is also intriguing that the lightest field fluctuating in the compact space will set the size of the dark energy and the size of the extra dimensions .",
    "we would like to draw a connection between the scale of this dark energy and a neutrino mass and thereby reduce the number of small parameters in need of explanation .",
    "although our toy model does not manage to forge this connection ( the `` neutrino '' we will use is not the standard model neutrino for reasons discussed below ) , we will mention possible scenarios that could .    by way of brief summary , note that the casimir energies arising from field fluctuations in large dimensions are insignificant since the contributions are inversely proportional to some power of the size of the space . for small extra dimensions , on the other hand , casimir energies can be correspondingly large .",
    "in fact , by balancing the casimir energy contributions of fields with different masses and spins , the total casimir energy , as a function of the radius of the extra dimensions , can develop a non - trivial minimum that stabilizes their size .",
    "and with the size of the extra dimensions fixed , the large dimensions feel ever - more of this casimir energy density as they expand , which is the hallmark behavior of dark energy . due to fluxes in string theory ,",
    "may well dominate the energy density of the universe and drive inflation on its own , in which case the casimir energy is not providing any fundamentally new physics , although it will alter the details by lifting the field out of the minimum of the potential or by changing it s overall shape in a possibly important way . ]    as we discuss below , there are substantial difficulties to realizing a phenomenologically viable version of this scenario , but it is intriguing to note that casimir energies have the potential of fruitfully linking the issues of moduli stabilization , large / small dimensions , and dark energy .",
    "there are many ways in which familiar features of isotropic cosmologies differ significantly when considered in anisotropic settings .",
    "we briefly review two examples that play a key role in what follows .",
    "first is the famous conclusion that accelerated expansion arises from a cosmological source with a sufficiently negative pressure ( @xmath0 ) : @xmath1 as this familiar equation assumes isotropy , it is illuminating to consider an anisotropic spacetime with metric @xmath2 .",
    "then , from the einstein equations we can make the following comparison : @xmath3 where the volume is @xmath4 and the @xmath5 are the hubble factors . for a growing overall volume , the @xmath6 is a friction term and the pressure differential is a driving force .",
    "in contrast to our intuition from the isotropic case , we can see that the role of negative pressure is more nuanced than one would expect .",
    "namely , negative pressure @xmath7 in the @xmath8 direction acts to _ decelerate _ expansion in that direction relative to the others , while negative pressure in directions transverse to the @xmath8 dimension act to accelerate expansion relative to the other dimensions . in an isotropic cosmology ,",
    "all the pressures have equal magnitudes and , as can be seen from eqn .",
    "( [ uno ] ) , combine to yield a net acceleration in each spatial dimension .",
    "but , fundamentally speaking , negative pressure does not necessarily entail acceleration .",
    "second , consider the nature of casimir energy in an @xmath9 dimensional spacetime with all of the spatial sections compact with characteristic size @xmath10 .",
    "the associated stress tensor , @xmath11 takes the form @xmath12 where the energy density has the form @xmath13 , and the pressure in each dimension , defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the volume , is @xmath16 .",
    "if we now relax isotropy , say , by taking @xmath17 of the spatial dimensions to be an isotropic torus whose radii are set by @xmath10 , while the remaining @xmath18 spatial dimensions comprise @xmath19 ( or at least are very large ) and evolve according to the scale @xmath20 , then @xmath21 where , as before , @xmath13 but now the pressure in the large directions is @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "the equation of state @xmath24 follows since @xmath25 does not depend on @xmath20 and will hold in the large directions regardless of the topology on the compact space . by contrast , the pressure in the small directions is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "consistent with our first observation , it is straightforward to see that this form of the stress energy tensor gives a negative contribution of @xmath28 to the right hand side in eqn .",
    "( [ differential ] ) , despite the negative pressure in the large directions .",
    "furthermore , the extra dimensions will expand or contract in response to the internal pressure so that @xmath29 can not be neglected in analyzing the dynamics .",
    "( shear from contracting directions can even drive inflation in vacuum @xcite . )    in the same spirit of examining features of less symmetric cosmologies , it is worthwhile to consider casimir contributions of not only massless fields ( implicit in the expressions above ) but also massive fields . and as we show below , the casimir energy from massive fields in a @xmath30-dimensional universe can lead to an equation of state that drives a de sitter epoch in @xmath31 directions while simultaneously stabilizing the additional @xmath17 compact dimensions .",
    "in particular , we show on general grounds that this dynamics is achieved with an equation of state @xmath24 and @xmath32 . if the casimir energy is due to a massless field in a toroidal compactification in @xmath17 flat directions , then @xmath13 and @xmath33 as noted .",
    "however , we show that if there are massive fields and/or there are other scales at play  curvature , warp factors , branes , specific topologies",
    " then @xmath32 becomes possible .",
    "while this might seem like a strange equation of state , it is not pathological as can be confirmed , for example , by looking at an effective field theory description in which we integrate over the compact directions .",
    "this folds the size of the space @xmath10 into a radion field @xmath34 in an einstein frame and the casimir energy into a potential @xmath35 .",
    "as we will see in  [ ef ] , the anisotropic equation of state with @xmath32 is equivalent to a stable minimum of the potential @xmath35 .",
    "the potential , it should be emphasized , is solely due to the casimir effect .",
    "there is no @xmath36 , nor any other effects , added .",
    "a sense of the size of @xmath10 can be gained by setting the dimensionally reduced casimir energy ( i.e. the 4-dimensional energy density @xmath37 ) equal to the current cosmological constant . by dimensional analysis , the dimensionally reduced casimir energy from a massless field ",
    "we will later consider massive modifications  in a flat spacetime must be of the form @xmath38 since @xmath10 is the only scale in the problem .",
    "given the measured value of the dark energy @xcite , a comparison gives @xmath39 which yields a scale of @xmath40 for @xmath41 , or , in terms of a mass @xmath42 .",
    "a well known approach for making such large extra dimensions phenomenologically viable is to consider standard model fields to be confined to a brane and only gravitational fields to propogate in the bulk .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath43 is just below the experimental bounds on deviations of newton s law @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mass scale associated with @xmath44 is in the range of recent neutrino mass measurements , an observation which will motivate the appearance of a small scale in our analysis below but one which , as will become clear , we ve yet to incorporate in a fully realistic model .    before moving on to the details",
    ", we note that nothing in our discussion singles out @xmath31 for the number of large , non - compact spatial dimensions . instead",
    ", the point is that should a mechanism establish a sufficient asymmetry between large and small dimensions , the effects we describe here can maintain  and in fact augment  that asymmetry .",
    "moreover , note too that because casimir energies are sensitive to global topology , not every choice of topology will stabilize the compact dimensions .",
    "this leads to the intriguing possibility that if all of the spatial dimensions are compact @xcite , the reason some expand and others stay small may be due to the topological form of the large vs.  small dimensions .",
    "whatever physical law selects topology may thus have inadvertently fated three dimensions to grow large .",
    "we begin with the action for general relativity in @xmath30 spacetime dimensions , @xmath45 ( with @xmath46 ) coupled to a source action whose explicit form we will specify shortly .",
    "we take the metric to be homogeneous but anisotropic , @xmath47 where @xmath20 is the scale factor of the @xmath31 large directions and @xmath10 is the scale factor of the @xmath17 small directions , and we allow for the possibility that the large dimensions are finite but large so that any casimir effect due to those dimensions is negligibly small . we take the small dimensions to be compactified on an @xmath17-torus for simplicity . in the future it should be interesting to consider the impact of other topologies .    the einstein equations can be written as @xmath48\\label{2 } \\\\",

    "it is interesting to note that @xmath63 is independent of the number of small dimensions and that it approaches @xmath64 as the number of large dimensions gets big .",

    "stability requires that effective potential to be concave up . in other words , the derivative of the right hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) with respect to @xmath10 needs to be negative for stability .",
    "the full quantum energy momentum tensor for the casimir effect from a massless field can be calculated from the @xmath17-dimensional green s function using a method of images technique to sum over the infinite copies in the compact space .",
    "but , since @xmath10 is the only scale in the problem , we can also see dimensionally that @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath25 is to be independent of @xmath20 , the conservation equation ( [ 4 ] ) requires the second term vanish and this requires @xmath56 , as did conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) .",
    "( this also follows directly from @xmath66 , and the requirement that @xmath25 is independent of @xmath20 . )",
    "the conservation equation then reduces to @xmath67 , which can be reexpressed as @xmath68 where @xmath69 . for a massless field",
    "then @xmath70 .",
    "( in the case of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the total number of spatial dimensions , as discussed in  [ asym ] . )",
    "this equation of state does not stabilize the dimensions nor does it act as a dark energy .",
    "however , suppose we consider an energy density of the form @xmath74 this , in fact , is the basic form of the casimir energy for a light field ( @xmath75 ) with one flat compact direction with periodic boundary conditions . for scalar fields @xmath76 and for fermions @xmath77 .",
    "we will show below that the form ( [ rhotry ] ) results from the sum of casimir contributions from a spectrum of massive particles that , for definiteness , we can imagine to be neutrino - like species .",
    "other mechanisms to generate a @xmath25 with the properties needed could involve fields from a hidden sector of string theory with masses of specific relative magnitudes , and/or certain conditions on the topology . since a supersymmetric theory would have equal and opposite contributions from fermions and bosons , the total casimir energy would vanish , so @xmath25 also depends on the specific manner in which supersymmetry is broken .",
    "if , for example , supersymmetry is only broken on a brane @xcite , then the boundaries set up by a configuration of branes will entirely shape the casimir energy . the existence of branes will also generate a different metric , which might be difficult to determine .",
    "although we ll return to this discussion below , we show here that a casimir energy of this form can realize the scenario described above .",
    "hereafter we consider @xmath78 .",

    "this condition can be satisfied for all @xmath17 although the window gets pretty narrow as @xmath17 gets large .    the critical value @xmath82 with the negative sign in eqn.([extrema ] )",

    "the hubble factor for the large dimensions alternates in a series of accelerations and decelerations as the scale factor of the extra dimensions oscillates about the value @xmath82 .",
    "eventually @xmath10 settles at the value @xmath82 , as shown on the right hand side of fig .",

    "since our interest , ultimately , is in how this scenario appears to a four dimensional observer , it is worthwhile rephrasing our analysis in the language of four - dimensional effective field theory . toward this end ,",

    "the radion picture is particularly useful for examining forms of @xmath25 that could stabilize the extra dimensions and create the dark energy .",

    "the energy density @xmath25 is negative for bosons and positive for fermions .",
    "now , let s consider the casimir energies due to two fermion fields and one scalar field , all having different masses ( not necessarily light ) as drawn in fig .",

    "we neglect any brane tension as well as any bulk cosmological constant .",
    "( alternatively , they can be tuned to cancel . )",
    "if the only field propogating in the bulk is the gravition , then there is nothing to superpose to create a minimum .",
    "however , if we posit the existence of sterile fields in the bulk ( a possibility pursued for other , phenomenologically motivated reasons in ) , we can arrange for a minimum to emerge with careful choices of masses and numbers of degrees of freedom .",
    "we do not justify the existence of these fields phenomenologically , as our intention here is simply to demonstrate that if such fields are present it is possible to stabilize the radion .",
    "we limit ourselves to flat internal dimensions but there is reason to suppose that curvature or a warp factor could provide the additional scale needed to generate a minimum and thereby remove the dependence on superposing masses .",
    "we leave that for a future investigation .",
    "we take the particle spectrum in the bulk to consist of sterile bulk majorana neutrinos with masses @xmath114 , and @xmath115 with @xmath116 . in this toy model",
    "we imagine that there are equal and opposite numbers of massless fermions and bosons .",
    "other combinations of massess and spins can be used so this is just in way of illustration .",
    "we want @xmath117 , which corresponds to a minimum of @xmath118 . for simply periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "each term ( [ bn ] ) in the sum of the contributions is positive and it is impossible to add them to get a minimum . to create a minimum ,",
    "we add @xmath119 fermion degrees of freedom with anti - periodic boundary conditions and mass in between the two light neutrinos , @xmath120 .",
    "the casimir energy in @xmath113 dimensions compactified on @xmath121 with antiperiodic boundary conditions is : @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "we can interpret this as the addition of a sterile dirac neutrino with mass , @xmath124 .",
    "this example establishes that we can find positive minima , as shown in fig .",
    "[ exists2 ] , for a very tight region , narrower than @xmath125 .    returning to the expansion in terms of @xmath126 and @xmath127",

    "we only remark that such an expansion shows clearly that @xmath132 is very tightly constrained ; using condition ( [ condboth ] ) for @xmath71 , @xmath133 this translates directly into the statement that the relative masses and relative degrees of freedom have to be tuned to create a positive energy density minimum . for any quantitative results we continue to use the full bessel functions .    for comparison with the add braneworld scenario proposed to address the mass hierarchy problem ",
    "that scenario favored @xmath84 extra dimensions  we can consider a @xmath134-dimensional spacetime with two directions compactified on a 2-torus of radius @xmath10 and a particle spectrum in the bulk consisting of a massless spin 2 boson ( 2 degrees of freedom ) and a massless fermion that we can think of as a bulk dirac neutrino ( 4 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "also needed is a light fermion  another sterile dirac neutrino ( 4 degrees of freedom )  living in the bulk with mass @xmath135 .",
    "we want @xmath117 , which corresponds to a minimum of @xmath136 .",
    "these fields give a net positive contribution to the casimir energy . to get the negative contribution needed we add @xmath137 bulk scalar degrees of freedom with mass @xmath138 .",
    "( alternatively , we could interpret this as another sterile dirac neutrino with anti - periodic boundary conditions . ) numerically , we find positive minima for a very tight region , narrower than @xmath139 .",
    "again , in terms of @xmath126 and @xmath127 , condition ( [ condboth ] ) for @xmath84 , imposes the restriction @xmath140 or equivalently @xmath141 . the range gets tighter as more additional dimensions are invoked .    for @xmath142 , the resultant @xmath143 and @xmath106 from the full bessel functions",

    "the size of the space needed to fix the dark energy at the observed value is therefore consistent with the size needed to address the hierarchy problem .",
    "the cosmological constant problem would then be directly mappable to the hierarchy problem . even if the vaccum energy is naturally zero",
    ", the boundary conditions on the finite extra dimensions can create a dark energy of the observed magnitude .",
    "since the dark energy is really set by the neutrino mass in the bulk , the picture would feel more complete if such light bulk fields could also find some justification .",
    "it should not go without mention that the mass @xmath153ev is a reasonable value for a neutrino mass and we have been able to express the small dark energy naturally in these units .",
    "the shortcoming is that these are , again , bulk neutrino fields and not standard model fields .",
    "thus , from the perspective of our toy models , the parameters in the effective lagrangian are simply chosen to accommodate dark energy .",
    "if these ideas could be incorporated into a more realistic scenario , they might suggest a mechanism linking neutrino masses and dark energy .",
    "although we ve yet to achieve that link , viable directions to pursue include consideration of internal manifolds whose geometry and topology separates the casimir and kaluza - klein scales allowing standard model fields to have fluctuations that live in the bulk .",
    "if this were successful , then the field setting the scale of dark energy could be a light standard model neutrino thereby reducing the number of small parameters in need of explanation .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the hierarchy between the planck scale and the electroweak scale @xmath154 is repeated in the hierarchy between the observed neutrino mass splittings of @xmath155 ev and the electroweak scale : @xmath156 .",
    "attempts to connect the two have invoked sterile neutrinos in the bulk @xcite . however , these models require massless neutrinos in the bulk and do not offer an explanation for a light massive fermion in the bulk .    the numerical coincidence between the magnitude of a casimir term from macroscopic extra dimensions and the magnitude of the dark energy has been noted before",

    "we re able to generate a proper dark energy with the correct equation of state ( @xmath157 and @xmath158 , not @xmath24 , @xmath159 ) so that the dimensions are fixed and a de sitter expansion is sourced .",
    "furthermore , this example hints at a connection between the dark energy , a light sterile neutrino in the bulk , and the hierarchy problem .",
    "the ability to sweep up so many seemingly disparate mysteries into one framework is obviouly appealing .",
    "the possibility that these sterile fields could have heavier kaluza - klein excitations that might be connected with the dark matter adds another layer of interest to this approach @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to stress that the confining potential is generally quite shallow @xmath160 in fig .  [ exists ] , implying that the most minor of perturbations to the energy density could unravel the extra dimensions .",

    "however , at earlier times , the presence of non - relativistic matter dominates the shape and eventually destroys the presence of extrema altogether , as shown in fig .",
    "[ matter ] .",
    "the effect is to force @xmath10 to expand so that even if a minimum exists today , @xmath10 has already sped past it with no way back to its stable position",
    ". this may be curable if there are meta - stable minima to keep @xmath10 hovering near its stable value , allowing it to roll gently into today s minimum when it appears .",
    "the point is that it is not enough to understand the shape of the potential today .",
    "the early universe has to be investigated as well to determine if @xmath10 can actually make it to its minimum value .",
    "an early universe cosmology that begins supersymmetric would have no casimir energy ",
    "except that due to thermal effects .",
    "a conformal anomaly contribution also arises in an expanding space @xcite .",
    "after supersymmetry is broken , any field with @xmath184 will contribute to the casimir energy and thereby shape the potential for @xmath10 .",
    "as the universe cools , different species contribute to the energy density in non - relativistic matter leading to an alteration in the shape of the potential .",
    "these issues are currently being investigated @xcite to see if the extra dimensions could drive inflation and then smoothly evolve to generate the dark energy today .",
    "it is perhaps also worth noting that if we are willing to accept some radical fine tuning , the potential can be made arbitrarily deep .",
    "as @xmath124 decreases to some critical value , the energy density at the minimum will be pushed closer to zero . instead of interpreting these bulk fields as neutrinos",
    ", we can suppose they are associated with electroweak scale physics and have mass @xmath185tev .",
    "then @xmath186 and we need not even be on a brane .",
    "we could imagine this in a model of universal extra dimensions ( ued ) where all standard model fields propagate in all dimensions @xcite . in units of @xmath151 , @xmath25",
    "could be arranged to be exceedingly small relative to a tev , @xmath187 by choosing the relative masses so carefully that a near cancellation occurs .",
    "the potential would be quite stable , even to the effects of ordinary matter , although one would have to investigate if tunneling out of the minimum was viable .",
    "but , of course , this extreme fine tunning would be none other than the usual cosmological constant problem recast . turning this around , in a model of ued ,",
    "casimir energy contributions to the energy density of the universe would naturally be huge , with no obvious mechanism for cancellation  other than a fortuitous near cancellation between masses .",
    "we ve shown that casimir energies  which unavoidably arise in non - supersymmetric theories with compact extra dimensions  can act to stabilize the size of the extra dimensions while also sourcing accelerated expansion in the familiar four spacetime dimensions . while we ve only worked in the context of toy models , we find it intriguing that there might be a link between issues of moduli stabilization and dark energy that is a direct consequence of quantum mechanics on compact spaces .",
    "we ve also noted how this approach may link geometrical asymmetries to topological asymmetries .",
    "namely , because the topology of spacetime s spatial sections determines the form of the resulting casimir energy , different topologies will result in different moduli potentials .",
    "some potentials will stabilize all but three spatial dimensions , as in the example discussed herein , while others will stabilize different numbers of spatial dimensions . in an ensemble of finite @xmath30-dimensional universes ,",
    "the number of dimensions that evolve to be large or small in a given universe will depend on the topology .",
    "explaining the existence of @xmath31 large dimensions may thus reduce to explaining the topology of the universe .",
