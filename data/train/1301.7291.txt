    "general relativity ( gr ) is a highly non - linear , dynamical theory of gravitation . yet , until the 1970s , almost all tests of gr were theoretically based on the behavior of test particles in a _",
    "static _ gravitational field @xcite .",
    "these include the perihelium precession of mercury , deflection of star light by the sun , and shapiro time delay .",
    "the parameterized post - newtonian ( ppn ) formalism ( for an overview , see @xcite ) was developed to provide a systematic framework for these and other checks , by appropriately parameterizing various aspects of spacetime geometry viewed as a non - linear superposition of contributions from _",
    "e.g. _  the sun and the planets .",
    "even so , the most important early experiments did not require much more than an expansion of the schwarzschild metric in @xmath0 up to the first few sub - leading terms , with @xmath1 the mass and @xmath2 the distance .",
    "although excellent agreement with theory was obtained , the aspects of gr that were actually tested were somewhat limited , mostly amounting to the influence on the motion of test particles of low - order general - relativistic corrections to the newtonian gravitational field .",
    "the situation improved with the discovery of the hulse - taylor binary neutron star in 1974 @xcite .",
    "one of the two stars can be observed electromagnetically as a pulsar , and from this signal it was inferred that the orbital motion of the binary changes as predicted by gr , assuming that orbital energy and angular momentum are being carried away by gravitational waves ( gw ) .",
    "this was an event of historic significance , as it provided incontrovertible evidence of the dynamical nature of the gravitational field .",
    "subsequently , similar and even more relativistic binary neutron stars were discovered , allowing for new tests of gr in a ",
    "post - keplerian \" framework @xcite . nevertheless , explaining the observed dissipative dynamics related to gravitational wave emission only requires a lowest - order approximation to gr in powers of @xmath3 , with @xmath4 a characteristic velocity .",
    "some of the most exciting aspects of general relativity still remain out of our empirical reach .",
    "what we would like to explore is the full non - linear dynamics of the gravitational field itself , including its self - interaction . from this perspective ,",
    "even the most relativistic binary neutron star system that is currently known , psr j0737 - 3039 @xcite , is still in the relatively slowly varying , weak - field regime , with an orbital compactness of @xmath5 ( where @xmath1 is the total mass and @xmath6 the orbital separation ) , and a typical orbital speed @xmath7 . ,",
    "and the orbital speed of the earth as it moves around the sun is @xmath8 .",
    "] by contrast , for a compact binary just prior to the final plunge and merger one has @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this will bring us to the genuinely strong - field , dynamical regime of general relativity , which in the foreseeable future will only be accessible by means of gravitational wave detectors .",
    "the first detection of gravitational waves by the advanced ligo and virgo detectors might happen as early as 2015 , and certainly before the end of the decade @xcite .",
    "around 2020 , a network of five large interferometric gw detectors will be in place : in addition to the two advanced ligo interferometers @xcite and advanced virgo @xcite , there will be the japanese kagra @xcite , and indigo in india @xcite .",
    "there is also the smaller geo - hf in germany @xcite .",
    "these are usually referred to as second - generation detectors .",
    "a conceptual design study for a third - generation observatory called einstein telescope ( et ) was recently concluded @xcite , and there are plans for a space - based observatory called lisa @xcite .",
    "there is a considerable body of literature on the projected capabilities of et and lisa in probing the dynamics of gravity .",
    "although attention will be given to these , our main focus in this chapter will be on what can be achieved with the upcoming advanced detectors .",
    "in particular , in the last few years , development has started of hands - on data analysis techniques for use on signals detected with second - generation observatories , properly taking into account the noisy detector output as well as the expectation that most sources will be near the threshold of detectability .",
    "since the advent of gr , a large number of alternative theories of gravity have been proposed ; for a partial list , see @xcite . among these",
    ", gr tends to be the simplest and the most elegant ; moreover , many of the alternatives are already strongly constrained by existing observations .",
    "consequently , our primary aim will not be to seek confirmation of an alternative theory and measure its parameters ; rather , we want to develop a test of gr itself . the testing should be as generic as we can make it , in the sense that if macroscopic deviations from gr exist , we want to find them even if they take a form that is yet to be envisaged , rather than looking inside a class of particular , existing alternative theories .",
    "that said , we will occasionaly mention the predictions of such alternative models to indicate the power of the probe that direct gravitational wave detection will provide us with .",
    "recently proposed tests of the strong - field dynamics broadly fall into two categories .",
    "one consists of checking for possible alternative polarization states beyond the two polarizations that gr predicts , and which might only make their presence known in the case of gravitational waves that were generated in the ultra - relativistic regime .",
    "the other category focuses on the coalescence process of compact binary objects ( neutron stars and black holes ) @xcite .",
    "searching for alternative polarizations started in earnest with the detailed studies made on the electromagnetically observed binary neutron stars . here",
    "we will explain how one would go about looking for their signature in data from gravitational wave detectors , in particular using transient signals such as will be emitted by supernova explosions or , again , coalescing compact binaries .",
    "there have also been studies about how to use _",
    "gravitational waves for this purpose @xcite ; these could take the form of a primordial gw background , or they could be a  bath \" of radiation caused by a large number of unresolvable astrophysical sources , such as the combined population of all compact binary coalescence events , or cosmic string cusps . due to space limitations , here we will limit ourselves to resolvable transient sources .",
    "although with a single interferometric detector one would not be able to tell the difference between , or even measure , additional polarizations , this does become possible with a _ network _ of detectors .",
    "in particular , it is possible to combine the outputs of multiple interferometers to construct a so - called _ null stream _ , which should be devoid of signals if the only polarization states present are the ones predicted by gr .",
    "more generally , one can have null streams which in addition to the usual tensor polarizations also exclude one or more of the alternative ones , allowing one to tell them apart . here",
    "we will partially follow the recent discussions by chatziioannou , yunes , and cornish @xcite , and by hayama and nishizawa @xcite .",
    "the coalescence of compact binaries consists of three regimes : an adiabatic _ inspiral _ , the _ merger _ leading to the formation of a single black hole ( or an exotic alternative object ! ) , and the _ ringdown _ of the resulting object as it evolves towards a quiescent state .",
    "the inspiral regime is reasonably well understood thanks to the so - called post - newtonian formalism @xcite , in which physical quantities such as energy and flux are expanded in powers of @xmath3 . a test of gr",
    "could then take the form of identifying directly measurable quantities , such as post - newtonian coefficients in an expansion of the orbital phase , which in gr are inter - related , and checking whether the predicted relationships really hold .",
    "this would constitute a very generic test of gr , in which no recourse needs to be taken to any particular alternative theory of gravity .",
    "such a test was first proposed by arun _",
    "next , yunes and pretorius developed the _",
    "parameterized post - einsteinian _ ( ppe )",
    "framework , which considerably generalized the family of waveforms used in @xcite by allowing for a larger class of parameterized deformations @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of arun _ et al .",
    "_ was implemented in a bayesian way by li _",
    "_ using waveforms in the ppe family @xcite .",
    "the latter approach focuses on hypothesis testing .",
    "this has the advantage that since for every detected sources the same ",
    "yes / no \" question is asked , evidence for or against gr has a tendency to build up as information from an increasing number of detections is included .    moving beyond the inspiral regime",
    ", the ringdown can be studied in a variety of ways . in particular ,",
    "the _ no hair theorem _ can be tested , which says that in gr , the spacetime around a quiescent , electrically neutral black hole is determined uniquely by its mass and spin @xcite .",
    "the ringdown process can be modeled as perturbations on a fixed black hole spacetime , and the einstein field equations impose relationships between the ringdown frequencies and damping times of the various modes that can get excited @xcite . verifying these inter - dependences amounts to testing the no hair theorem .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the _ amplitudes _ of the ringdown modes carry information about the masses and the spins of the binary compact object that merged to form a single black hole @xcite .",
    "as shown earlier by ryan , the no hair theorem can also be tested by monitoring the motion of a small object ( a neutron star or a stellar mass black hole ) around a very massive black hole or exotic object , effectively mapping out the latter s spacetime geometry @xcite .    as demonstrated by schutz already in 1986 , inspiraling and merging compact binaries can also be used as cosmic distances markers , or _ standard sirens _",
    ", to probe the large - scale structure and evolution of the universe @xcite . a variety of techniques have been proposed to exploit this fact using the second - generation detectors , et , and space - based detectors .",
    "the second - generation observatories will mainly give us information about the hubble constant @xmath11 ; however , they will do so in a way that is completely independent of existing measurements , and in particular does not require the so - called cosmic distance ladder , with its potentially unknown systematic errors at every rung @xcite . in the case of et and space - based detectors , it is also possible to study the matter content of the universe @xcite . by",
    "now we know that the expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite , which can be modeled heuristically by invoking a new substance called _",
    "dark energy_. an exciting prospect is probing the equation of state of dark energy with gravitational waves , again in a way that is independent of conventional observations .",
    "this chapter is structured as follows .",
    "[ sec : polarizations ] we discuss how one might look for alternative polarization states in transient gw signals , using a network of detectors .",
    "next , we explain how the inspiral of compact binaries can be used to arrive at a very generic test of the strong - field dynamics of general relativity , including self - interaction ( sec .",
    "[ sec : self - interaction ] )",
    ". the emphasis will be on second - generation detectors , where most sources will be near the threshold of detectability .",
    "as we shall see , in the case of binary neutron stars , appropriate data analysis methods are already in place , which can be applied to raw data from the advanced detectors as soon as they become available .",
    "binary black holes are dynamically far richer , but they also pose formidable data analysis problems . a discussion of merger and ringdown , and tests of the no hair theorem ,",
    "will naturally bring us to third - generation ground - based observatories as well as space - based detectors ( sec .",
    "[ sec : nohair ] ) , and we will give an overview of what one might expect from them . in sec .  [",
    "sec : cosmography ] , we will briefly recall the basics of modern cosmology , and investigate what gravitational wave observations might have to say about the evolution of the universe .",
    "a summary and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we will denote binary neutron stars by bns , neutron star - black hole systems by nsbh , and binary black holes by bbh .",

    "in the so - called transverse - traceless gauge , the metric perturbation only has spatial components , and for a signal propagating in the @xmath15 direction in a coordinate system associated with unit vectors @xmath16 , it can be brought in the form @xcite @xmath17 with @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the magnitudes of the independent  plus \" and  cross \" tensor polarizations , respectively .",

    "we know that the energy loss due to non - tensor emission must be less than 1% @xcite",
    ". however , alternative polarizations might show up in more weak - field regimes and after having propagated over distances much larger than the characteristic scale of the hulse - taylor binary .",
    "alternatively , they might only appear in situations where the source is far more relativistic , with high characteristic velocities @xmath3 . in core collapse supernovae ,",
    "radial velocities @xmath37 are attained @xcite , which may excite longitudinal modes . in the case of binary inspiral , @xmath38 is reached before the final plunge , which ( using kepler s third law ) corresponds to a gravitational wave frequency @xmath39 , with @xmath1 the total mass . for binary neutron stars with component masses",
    "@xmath40 this approximately equals 1600 hz , which is in the sensitivity band of ground - based detectors .",
    "there are a number of alternative theories of gravity which predict non - standard polarization states . to name but a few :    * brans - dicke theory is a scalar - tensor theory of gravity which has scalar modes @xcite .",
    "* scalar modes also occur in kaluza - klein theory , where our 4d world arises after compactification of one or more extra spatial dimensions @xcite . *",
    "certain brane world models , such as the dvali - gabadadze - porrati model in the self - accelerating branch , have all six modes above @xcite .",
    "a _ single _ interferometric detector would not suffice to disentangle all these polarization states . to see this ,",
    "consider a breathing mode ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : polarizations ] ) impinging upon a detector , coming from a direction that is perpendicular to the plane of the interferometer",
    ". then both detector arms would get lengthened and shortened in unison , but what an interferometer senses is the relative _ difference _ in arm length . or , consider a breathing mode whose propagation direction corresponds to the orientation of one of the arms .",
    "then this arm would be unaffected , while the other arm would still periodically get lenghtened and shortened , leading to a relative difference in arm lengths , which however would be indistinguishable from the effect of a gravitational wave with  plus \" polarization .",
    "hence , a _ network _ of interferometers is called for .",
    "consider @xmath41 detectors at different positions on the earth and whose noise is uncorrelated .",
    "a signal would reach the interferometers at different times . however , if one knew the sky position @xmath25 , _",
    "e.g. _ because of an electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational wave signal as might be expected from a conveniently oriented bns or nsbh event @xcite , then one would know how to time shift the outputs of the detectors to analyze the signal at a fixed time , say the arrival time at the earth s center .",

    "the overbar indicates that ( a ) we will be considering the fourier transforms of the relevant quantities , which are functions of frequency @xmath46 rather than time @xmath47 , and ( b ) the data streams have been divided by @xmath48 , with @xmath49 the _ noise spectral density _ ( basically the variance of the noise as a function of frequency ) for detector @xmath50 .",

    "hayama and nishizawa showed how to reconstruct the polarization modes in the case where the number of detectors is at least the number of modes , based on the null stream idea @xcite .",
    "as an illustration , they reconstructed a simulated longitudinal mode in brans - dicke theory .",
    "such a mode might be emitted by a supernova explosion , in which radial velocities @xmath37 are reached @xcite .",
    "if a statistical excess is seen in one or more null streams , then one would like to match - filter them with template waveforms that allow for one or more alternative polarization states to obtain information about their physical content .",

    "@xcite , and we refer the reader to that paper for details . the original ppe framework will be discussed below .",
    "within gr , especially the inspiral part of the coalescence process has been modeled in great detail using the post - newtonian ( pn ) formalism ( see @xcite and references therein ) , in which quantities such as the conserved energy and flux are found as expansions in @xmath3 , where @xmath79 is a characteristic speed . during inspiral",

    "the different pn terms in the phasing formula arise from non - linear multipole interactions as the wave propagates from the source s  near zone \" , where gravitational fields are strong , to the  far zone \" , where detection takes place .",
    "specifically , the physical content of some of the contributions is as follows :    * @xmath92 and @xmath93 encode the interaction of the total ( arnowitt - deser - misner , or adm @xcite ) mass - energy of the source with the quadrupole moment .",
    "the physical picture is that the quadrupolar waves scatter off the schwarzschild curvature generated by the source .",
    "these contributions are referred to as gravitational wave  tails \" .",

    "* @xmath95 includes the cubic non - linear interactions in the scattering of gravitational waves due to the adm mass - energy of the system @xcite .",
    "thus , observations of these pn contributions would allow for penetrating tests of the non - linear structure of general relativity .",
    "it is worth noting that with binary pulsars , one can only constrain the conservative sector of the orbital dynamics to 1pn order , and the dissipative sector to leading order ; see , _",

    "quadratic curvature terms arise in string theory compactifications @xcite , and dynamical chern - simons theory can be motivated both from string theory @xcite and loop quantum gravity @xcite , and also arises in effective field theories of inflation @xcite .",

    "if there are too many free parameters to be determined , the measurement accuracy of _ all _ of the parameters will be adversely affected , and we would still like to reduce the number of free @xmath113 , @xmath120 in ( [ phaseintermediate ] ) .",
    "alternative theories that have a non - zero @xmath121 contribution to the phase , such as scalar - tensor theories , can already be fairly well constrained using the electromagnetically observed binary pulsars @xcite . with direct gravitational wave detection , the regime where we will be the most sensitive to gr violations is the one where @xmath3 is large , which is out of reach for other observational methods .",

    "<S> this decade will see the first direct detections of gravitational waves by observatories such as advanced ligo and virgo . among the prime sources are coalescences of binary neutron stars and black holes , which are ideal probes of dynamical spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> this will herald a new era in the empirical study of gravitation . </S>",
    "<S> for the first time , we will have access to the genuinely strong - field dynamics , where low - energy imprints of quantum gravity may well show up . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we will be able to search for effects which might only make their presence known at large distance scales , such as the ones that gravitational waves must traverse in going from source to observer . </S>",
    "<S> finally , coalescing binaries can be used as cosmic distance markers , to study the large - scale structure and evolution of the universe .    with the advanced detector era fast approaching , </S>",
    "<S> concrete data analysis algorithms are being developed to look for deviations from general relativity in signals from coalescing binaries , taking into account the noisy detector output as well as the expectation that most sources will be near the threshold of detectability . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , several practical methods have been proposed to use them for cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> we explain the state of the art , including the obstacles that still need to be overcome in order to make optimal use of the signals that will be detected . </S>",
    "<S> although the emphasis will be on second - generation observatories , we will also discuss some of the science that could be done with future third - generation ground - based facilities such as einstein telescope , as well as with space - based detectors . </S>"
