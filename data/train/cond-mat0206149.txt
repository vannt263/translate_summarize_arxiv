    "random walks , naturally connected to the problem of diffusion on discrete structures , are also important tools for studying the properties of inhomogeneous networks . in fact they represent the main link between the geometrical and the physical properties of graphs : a walker needs only the information about local connectivity for the one  step jump probabilities , but for sufficiently long times it samples the whole underlying structure , so that its long time statistics reflects the large scale topology which , in turn , is responsible for many physical properties .",
    "random walks also represent a connection between mathematics and physics : these are extensively studied in the mathematical literature because of their connections with markov chains , algebraic graph theory and potential theory ( see for example @xcite ) while , on the other side , many physical problems such as the study of vibrational spectrum @xcite , the critical behavior of statistical models @xcite or simple models of quantum particles @xcite on discrete networks can be mapped to random walks . in particular the type problem ,",
    "i.e. whether for a certain graph a random walker returns to its starting point with probability one ( _ recurrent _ graph ) or has a nonzero chance to escape ( _ transient _ graph ) , is strictly related to the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking of statistical models defined on the same structure @xcite .    for inhomogeneous structures the local properties can be different from the average ones , so the type problem on the average has been introduced @xcite : a graph is said to be _ recurrent on the average _ ( roa ) or _ transient on the average _ ( toa ) on the basis of the average over all nodes of the returning probability .",
    "this new classification has been shown to be the appropriate one in the analysis of statistical models : in particular on roa graphs , classical @xmath0 and quantum heisenberg ferromagnetic spin models can not show spontaneous magnetization at any finite temperature @xcite ; on the contrary on toa ones , @xmath0 models @xcite must have a non ",
    "zero magnetization at finite temperature .    in this paper",
    "we show that a whole class of trees , which are defined _ bounded _ trees in @xcite , are recurrent on the average .",
    "this class is composed by all infinite trees that satisfy two requirements with a natural physical meaning : first the coordination number of the nodes must be bounded ( when the graph is embedded in an euclidean space , the number of nearest neighbors of a given site has a geometrical upper bound if the links have bounded length ) , then the `` surface '' must be negligible with respect to the `` volume '' for large distances ( this is necessary for the existence of the thermodynamic limit or simply if the graph has to be embedded in a finite  dimensional euclidean space ) .",
    "the proof is based on the flow criterion : this is a powerful tool for the study of the local type problem @xcite and recently it has been extended to the case on the average @xcite . the result obtained in this paper",
    "has an important consequence that follows from the previously stated connections between random walk and statistical models defined on graphs : there can not be spontaneous symmetry breaking for classical @xmath0 and quantum heisenberg ferromagnetic models on any bounded tree .",
    "moreover the recurrence on the average implies that the average spectral dimension @xmath1 of these trees is always smaller than 2 ; this is a first exact result about the average spectral dimension for bounded trees even if we expect the true upper limit to be @xmath2 .",
    "indeed this has been conjectured ( but not proved ) in @xcite and the inequality @xmath3 is satisfied by all known examples of bounded trees .",
    "another remark about our result is that there are no corresponding results concerning the local recurrence : there are indeed examples of locally transient bounded trees @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in next section we recall the definitions about graph averages , recurrence and transience , and the flow criterion ; then in section  [ sec : main ] we formally state and prove our result about the recurrence on the average of bounded trees .",
    "given an infinite graph @xmath4 , let us call @xmath5 the set of vertices ( nodes ) and @xmath6 the set of edges ( links ) . for @xmath7 the sphere @xmath8 and the spherical shell @xmath9 are defined as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the chemical distance on the graph @xmath4 .",
    "now consider a function @xmath12 defined on @xmath5 ; the limit on the average @xmath13 is defined as @xcite : @xmath14 if @xmath15 , the characteristic function of a subset @xmath16 , we write @xmath17 instead of @xmath18 and call it measure of @xmath19 .",
    "we will consider also the upper and lower limit on the average : @xmath20 because these always exist while the limit in equation  ( [ eq - limit ] ) may not exist",
    ".      given a graph @xmath4 and a node @xmath21 , consider the probability @xmath22 for a random walker started from @xmath23 to ever return to the starting vertex : @xmath4 is said to be _ ( locally ) transient _ if @xmath24 and _ ( locally ) recurrent _ if @xmath25 .",
    "this classification is a property of the graph and does not depend on the choice of starting node @xmath23 because it is easy to prove , using standard markov chain properties , that if @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) for any node @xmath7 then @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) for every other node @xmath30 .",
    "a graph is said to be _ transient on the average _ if , for @xmath21 @xmath31 and _ recurrent on the average _ ( roa ) if , on the contrary , @xmath32    important properties of the classification on the average are @xcite :    * if there exists @xmath33 satisfying @xmath34 then @xmath35 for all @xmath7 or @xmath36 for all @xmath37 ( the classification does not depend on @xmath23 ) * local recurrence implies recurrence on the average , while this is not true for transience .",
    "if we give an orientation to the links of a graph , i.e. for every @xmath38 we write @xmath39 with @xmath40 , a _ flow from @xmath41 to infinity with input @xmath42 _ is a function @xmath43 defined on @xmath6 such that the `` current '' is conserved at every vertex @xmath23 : @xmath44 and its _ energy _ is @xmath45    the existence of finite energy flow is strictly related to transience , as expressed by the following :    * a graph @xmath4 is ( locally ) transient if and only if there exists @xmath7 such that it is possible to find a finite energy flow @xmath46 with non - zero input from @xmath23 to infinity @xcite ; * a graph @xmath4 with a bounded coordination is toa if and only if there exists @xmath47 such that @xmath48 and for every @xmath49 there is a finite energy flow @xmath46 from @xmath23 to @xmath50 with non - zero input and @xmath51 ( theorem 3.10 in @xcite ) .",
    "we prove that : + _ if @xmath4 is an infinite tree with bounded coordination and there exists @xmath52 such that @xmath53 then @xmath4 is roa . _    the outline of the proof is the following : first we define the `` backbone '' of @xmath4 and the set @xmath54 of the backbone `` branching '' nodes and we show that it has measure zero ; then we prove that for every set @xmath47 such that @xmath55 and for every @xmath56 there exists @xmath49 such that every flow @xmath46 from @xmath23 to infinity with input @xmath57 has energy @xmath58 , so that @xmath59 is infinite and the graph can not be toa .      consider the subgraph @xmath60 ( with vertex set @xmath61 ) obtained from @xmath4 by deleting all vertices and links belonging only to finite branches and call it the backbone of @xmath4 ( fig  [ backb ] ) : it can be obtained by recursively deleting all nodes with coordination one together with the links originating from them .",
    "if @xmath61 is empty ( for example if @xmath4 is a half infinite one  dimensional chain , possibly with finite trees attached to some or all nodes ) then @xmath4 is recurrent ( and therefore roa ) . in this case , in fact , for every node @xmath21",
    "there is only one path that leads to infinity : because of current conservation @xmath62 must be finite and constant on the edges @xmath63 belonging to this path and zero on every other edge and this implies that @xmath64 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath61 is non  empty let us call `` branching '' the nodes @xmath65 whose coordination in @xmath60 is greater than 2 ; these vertices are important because they are the only ones in which a current can split so that the flow energy can be reduced .",
    "now define @xmath54 the set of branching nodes , @xmath66 the set of branching nodes inside a ball of radius @xmath67 and center @xmath41 and @xmath68 the vertices of @xmath69 belonging to @xmath61 : @xmath70    if there are no branching vertices ( @xmath54 is empty ) @xmath60 is a linear chain ( every node has coordination two ) and the flow from any vertex in @xmath5 has infinite energy so that @xmath4 is recursive ( and therefore roa ) . on the other hand",
    "even if @xmath54 is non  empty , it is a zero measure set in @xmath5 because @xmath71 so that @xmath72    now consider a subset @xmath47 such that @xmath55 , it is easy to see that for every @xmath73 there exists @xmath49 such that @xmath74 .",
    "in fact , suppose that there exists @xmath75 such that for every @xmath76 , @xmath77 , then @xmath78 but since @xmath54 has zero measure and @xmath4 has bounded coordination , @xmath79 has zero measure for every @xmath80 ( lemma 4.8 in @xcite ) and so @xmath81 contradicting the hypothesis .    then choose a distance @xmath82 and take @xmath7 such that @xmath74 ; there are two distinct cases : @xmath83 or @xmath84 .",

    "clearly the energy of a flow @xmath91 from @xmath23 decreases if we restrict the sum in equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) to the linear chain between @xmath92 and @xmath93 and all the `` restricted''energy of the flows can be parametrized by the fractions @xmath94 and @xmath95 of current directed toward the nodes @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively : @xmath96 on the other hand if @xmath23 belongs to a semi  infinite chain , in order to have a finite energy flow the @xmath62 must be constant in the path between @xmath23 and @xmath92 and zero in the other ( infinite ) part of the semi ",
