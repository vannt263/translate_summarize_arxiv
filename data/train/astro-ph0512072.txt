    "accurately determined properties of stars in detached eclipsing binaries provide fundamental data for testing models of stellar structure and stellar evolution ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . for stars less massive than the sun properties such as the stellar radius and the effective temperature",
    "have occasionally been found to disagree with model predictions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". directed efforts to find additional systems in this regime suitable for testing theory @xcite have produced a few cases , while other examples have been found serendipitously ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the present binary system is in the second category , since it was originally thought to be of a completely different nature .",
    "the photometric variability of v1061 cygni ( also known as hd  235444 , hip  104263 , rxj2107.3 + 5202 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , j2000 , spt f9 , @xmath20 ) was discovered photographically by @xcite , and the object was classified by @xcite as an algol - type binary with a period of 2.346656 days .",
    "other than occasional measurements of the time of primary eclipse , the system received very little attention until the spectroscopic work by @xcite , who observed it as part of his program to search for eclipsing binaries containing at least one lower main - sequence star ( late f to k ) .",
    "on the basis of two high - resolution spectra and other information popper concluded that 10 was most likely a semi - detached system of the rare  cool algol \" class , and dropped it from his program . unlike the classical algols , which are composed of a cool giant or subgiant and an early - type star ,",
    "the mass - gainer in the cool algols is also of late spectral type ( see * ? ? ?",
    "since less than a dozen of these systems are known , 10 was placed on the observing list at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( cfa ) in 1998 for spectroscopic monitoring , and photometric observations began later .",
    "not only did we discover that it is not a cool algol ( it is well detached , as reported by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we also found that : _",
    "i ) _ it is triple - lined ( and a hierarchical triple ) ; _ ii ) _ the secondary in the eclipsing pair is less massive than the sun and therefore potentially interesting for constraining models of stellar structure and evolution ( popper s original motivation for observing it ) ; and _ iii ) _ the mass ratio of the binary is quite different from unity , which makes it a favorable case for such tests .",
    "furthermore , the comparison with theory shows a significant discrepancy in the radius of the secondary , corroborating similar evidence from other systems and providing some insight into the problem .",
    "we describe below our observations and complete analysis of this system , including a discussion of the possible nature of the deviations from the models for low - mass stars .",
    "10 was observed at the cfa with an echelle spectrograph on the 1.5-m wyeth reflector at the oak ridge observatory ( eastern massachusetts ) , and occasionally also with a nearly identical instrument on the 1.5-m tillinghast reflector at the f.  l.  whipple observatory ( arizona ) .",
    "a single echelle order was recorded using intensified photon - counting reticon detectors , spanning about 45  at a central wavelength of 5187 , which includes the  b triplet .",
    "the resolving power of these instruments is @xmath21 , and the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios achieved range from 13 to about 40 per resolution element of 8.5  .",
    "a total of 74 spectra were collected from august 1998 until april 2005 .",
    "one archival spectrum from 1987 obtained with the same instrumentation was used as well .",
    "that observation was taken by j.  andersen , possibly at the request of d.  popper ( andersen , priv .",
    "comm . ) , and it shows double lines ( one sharp and one broad ; see figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "@xcite referred to that observation , and remarked that his own two spectra of the star also showed a sharp - lined and a broad - lined component .",
    "most of our more recent observations display similar features .",
    "the fact that the sharp - lined star is hardly moving whereas the other one moves significantly led popper to infer a mass ratio of roughly 8/1 , and to conclude that 10 is a cool algol .    as it turns out , the sharp - lined component is not the secondary in the eclipsing binary .",
    "closer inspection of the cross - correlation functions , after we had estimated crude velocities and discovered that the sharp - lined and broad - lined stars were not moving together , revealed the presence of a third star ( the true secondary ) changing velocity with the same 2.35-day period as the broad - lined component .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : spectra ] . in the following we refer to the broad - lined primary of the eclipsing binary ( which is the more massive one of the pair ) as star aa , to the secondary as star ab , and to the tertiary as star b.    radial velocities for the three stars",
    "were derived using an extension of the two - dimensional cross - correlation algorithm todcor @xcite to three dimensions @xcite .",
    "this technique uses three templates , one for each star , and is well suited to our relatively low s / n spectra allowing velocities to be obtained reliably even when the spectral lines are blended .",
    "templates for the cross correlations were selected from an extensive library of calculated spectra based on model atmospheres by r.  l.kurucz , computed for us by jon morse ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these calculated spectra are available for a wide range of effective temperatures ( @xmath22 ) , projected rotational velocities ( @xmath8 ) , surface gravities ( @xmath23 ) , and metallicities .",
    "experience has shown that radial velocities are largely insensitive to the surface gravity and metallicity adopted for the templates .",
    "consequently , the optimum template for each star was determined from grids of cross - correlations over broad ranges in temperature and rotational velocity ( since these are the parameters that affect the radial velocities the most ) , seeking to maximize the average correlation weighted by the strength of each exposure .",
    "surface gravities of @xmath24 and @xmath25 were adopted for aa and ab , from the light curve analysis described in  [ sec : photometry ] , and for star b we adopted @xmath25 .",
    "solar metallicity was assumed throughout , which the discussion in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] shows to be a good assumption in this case .",
    "the procedure of optimizing the templates leads to best - fit parameters for the stars as follows :    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     the stability of the zero - point of our velocity system was monitored by means of exposures of the dusk and dawn sky , and small run - to - run corrections were applied in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the radial velocities , we derived the light contributions of each star following @xcite .",
    "these are @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , expressed as fractions of the total light , and they correspond to the mean wavelength of our observations ( 5187 ) .    due to the narrow wavelength coverage of the cfa spectra there is always the possibility of systematic errors in the velocities , resulting from lines of the stars moving in and out of the window with orbital phase @xcite .",
    "occasionally these errors are significant , and experience has shown that this must be checked on a case - by - case basis ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for this we performed numerical simulations in which we generated artificial composite spectra by adding together synthetic spectra for the three components , with doppler shifts appropriate for each actual time of observation , computed from a preliminary orbital solution .",
    "the light fractions adopted were those derived above .",
    "we then processed these simulated spectra with the three - dimensional version of todcor in the same manner as the real spectra , and compared the input and output velocities .",
    "the differences were typically small for stars aa and b ( under 1  ) , and were up to about 3  for star ab .",
    "we applied these differences as corrections to the raw velocities , although they made little difference in the results other than slightly decreasing the residuals from the orbital fits .",
    "the final velocities including these corrections are given in table  [ tab : rvs ] .",
    "similar corrections were derived for the light fractions , and are already accounted for in the values reported above . as a further test we changed the template parameters for the two fainter stars , which are more uncertain , and recomputed the radial velocities and corrections .",
    "the resulting velocities were hardly different , giving us confidence in the robustness of the procedures .",
    "a double - lined spectroscopic orbital solution for the aa+ab system ( see column  2 of table  [ tab : allelements ] below ) produced a reasonably good fit with rms residuals of 2.4 and 5.1  , at about the level expected based on the broad lines and faint secondary .",
    "however , the residuals showed an obvious downward trend , less obvious but still present also in the secondary .",
    "the velocities for star b show a drift in the opposite direction ( figure  [ fig : rvresiduals ] ) with a slope about twice as steep , or @xmath155  per 1000 days .",
    "the system is thus a hierarchical triple , with a period for the outer orbit that could be very long , judging from the data available .",
    "the spectroscopic material alone does not sufficiently constrain the wide orbit to properly account for the change in the center - of - mass velocity of the eclipsing pair , which could introduce biases in the derived masses of components aa and ab . however , as we show in the next section , the additional information provided by the measurement of times of eclipse and , to some extent , the astrometric data @xcite from the hipparcos mission described later are very helpful in constraining the elements of the outer orbit .",
    "measurements of the times of minimum light for 10 spanning more than seven decades have been made by photographic , visual , and photoelectric / ccd techniques .",
    "table  [ tab : timings ] collects all available estimates , including some that have not appeared previously in print and were kindly communicated to us by j.  m.  kreiner ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a total of 43 timings for the deeper primary minimum and 6 for the secondary are listed .",
    "many of the more recent measurements between 2001 and 2004 are based on our own photometric observations with a robotic telescope described in more detail below .",
    "the @xmath29 residuals from a linear ephemeris are shown in figure  [ fig : origomc ] , and exhibit a pattern of variations caused by the presence of the distant third component ( light travel effect ) .",
    "this is most obvious in the more accurate and numerous measurements of the last 25 years , during which more than a full cycle has been covered .",
    "the period of the outer orbit is therefore fairly well constrained by these data , as is the amplitude of the variation , which is directly related to the velocity amplitude of the binary around the center - of - mass of the triple .",
    "these measurements provide information complementary to that from the radial velocities , and we incorporate them into the analysis in  [ sec : orbit ] .",
    "absolute photometry of 10 on the @xmath30 system was obtained by @xcite .",
    "the value of the reddening - free parameter @xmath31 was calculated and compared with the standard star values of @xcite .",
    "the value corresponded to that of a spectral type g0 star with an intrinsic color of @xmath32 , with no significant interstellar reddening .",
    "the uncertainty here comes mainly from the calibration .",
    "the observed mean color index corresponds to a spectral type f9 star with a temperature of 6040  k , according to the calibration of @xcite .",
    "after some iterations with the photometric light curve fitting algorithm described below , it was found that the visual surface brightness ratio @xmath33 is about 0.43 , which constrains the difference in the visual flux parameter @xmath34 and hence the temperature difference through the calibration in table  1 by @xcite .",
    "this procedure leads to photometric temperature estimates of @xmath35  k for the primary and @xmath36  k for the secondary component .",
    "these temperatures were used to estimate the limb - darkening and gravity - brightening parameters to be used in the photometric modeling .",
    "they are in excellent agreement with those of the spectroscopic analysis above .",
    "relative photometric observations of 10 were obtained at two different facilities .",
    "measurements in the @xmath37 band were made with the 0.26-m ursa robotic telescope at kimpel observatory on the campus of the university of arkansas at fayetteville .",
    "a total of 6914 observations were collected between march 2001 and october 2004 , which are given in table  [ tab : ursa ] . for details on the observation and reduction methods the reader",
    "is referred to the description by @xcite .",
    "the precision of an individual measurement is estimated to be 0.010 mag .",
    "observations were also made with the 0.4-m f/11 ealing cassegrain reflector at gettysburg college observatory , in gettysburg ( pennsylvania ) .",
    "the detector was a photometrics ( roper scientific ) ch-350 thermoelectrically - cooled ccd camera with a back - illuminated site 003b @xmath38 chip and standard bessell @xmath39 filters .",
    "tables  [ tab : gettyb][tab : gettyi ] list the observations obtained between september 2002 and september 2003 , which number 732 , 738 , 739 , and 740 in the @xmath40 , @xmath37 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 passbands , respectively .",
    "the estimated precision of these differential measurements is 0.011 mag in @xmath40 , 0.008 mag in @xmath37 , 0.009 mag in @xmath41 , and 0.012 mag in @xmath42 .",
    "the comparison stars used for these two data sets are given in table  [ tab : comparisons ] .",
    "the ursa photometry was referenced to the magnitude corresponding to the sum of the intensities of all four comparison stars in order to improve the measurement accuracy .",
    "because the eclipse timings for 10 described earlier show changes due to motion about the center of mass of the triple system , light elements used in analyzing the photometric data were based on contemporary observations made between march 2001 and october 2004 with the ursa telescope .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : origomc ] the curvature of the @xmath29 residuals is relatively small in this interval , and a linear ephemeris is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "a fit to 12 primary minima ( see table  [ tab : timings ] ) yielded @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number of cycles elapsed from the epoch of reference , and the values in parentheses represent the uncertainties of the elements in units of the last digit .",
    "photometric data were then phased according to these elements .",
    "the ursa and gettysburg data sets were analyzed with the nelson - davis - etzel model ( ebop code ) as described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although other models may be more sophisticated , this program is perfectly adequate for well - detached systems such as 10 .",
    "the main adjustable parameters in the nde model are the relative surface brightness ( @xmath45 ) of the secondary of the eclipsing binary ( star ab ) in units of that of the primary ( aa ) , the relative radius of the primary ( @xmath46 ) in units of the separation , the ratio of radii ( @xmath47 ) , the inclination of the orbit of the binary ( @xmath48 ) , the limb - darkening coefficients ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) , the eccentricity parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and the amount of third light ( @xmath53 , expressed as a fraction of the total light ) , which is significant in our case .",
    "the luminosity due to the reflection effect was computed from bolometric theory .",
    "the mass ratio ( @xmath54 ) was adopted from the spectroscopic results in  [ sec : orbit ] .",
    "tests showed the orbital eccentricity was probably not significantly different from zero , consistent with the results described later , so @xmath55 was fixed at zero for the photometric modeling . for the ursa data the ebop algorithm converged with all variables free , except for the gravity - brightening coefficients @xmath56 , which were set from theory @xcite .",
    "for the gettysburg data sets the limb - darkening coefficients @xmath57 had to be fixed at theoretical values @xcite , as were the gravity - brightening coefficients .",
    "additionally , for the gettysburg data the values of third light in the spectral bands @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 had to be estimated from the temperature of the third star based on the spectroscopic analysis in  [ sec : spectroscopy ] .",
    "the third light value in @xmath37 was adopted from the ursa data solution ( @xmath58 ) . for these reasons ,",
    "the final mean geometric parameters based on the gettysburg data have been assigned uncertainties two times the internal estimates , consistent with our experience with ebop in these situations .",
    "initial light curve solutions with the ursa data showed that observations during the night of jd @xmath59 ( 24 may 2001 ) , which followed a secondary eclipse , were significantly fainter than the fitted orbit by @xmath150.025 mag .",
    "no other observations at this phase ( 0.57 ) were collected until the 20032004 seasons .",
    "additionally , data on jd @xmath60 and jd @xmath61 ( 2004 season ) obtained during and after secondary eclipse were seen to be brighter than the fitted curve by @xmath150.01 mag .",
    "measurements taken 12 days earlier at a similar phase appear to be normal , as are those taken two months later .",
    "possible explanations for these deviations include some unknown calibration problem in the data reductions , or transitory spots on one or both stars that change on timescales of a month or two .",
    "the latter would not be unusual given the strong x - ray emission from the system @xcite , indicative of chromospheric activity ( see  [ sec : activity ] ) .",
    "if due to spots , the extent of the active regions appears to be quite large ( up to 4050  in longitude ) , judging from the phase interval affected .",
    "tests showed that removal of these ursa observations had an insignificant effect on the results other than decreasing the scatter .",
    "we have thus chosen to exclude the data on those three nights from the final fitting process .",
    "further support for intrinsic variations is given by similar deviations seen in the gettysburg data at other phases , particularly phase @xmath150.45 , as shown below in figure  [ fig : getty ] .",
    "the angular extent of this particular feature is again @xmath1540 .",
    "a hint of a dimming at about the same phase may be present also in the ursa observations during the same season , although the data sampling is not optimal for confirming this .",
    "the results of our photometric analysis are given in table  [ tab : lightelements ] , separately for each of the gettysburg passbands and for ursa @xmath37 .",
    "the mean of the gettysburg results are also listed , with uncertainties that account for the scatter between the @xmath39 results .",
    "there is excellent agreement in the geometric elements between the two data sets .",
    "the light curve and residuals for the ursa measurements are shown in figure  [ fig : ursaall ] , and enlargements of the regions around the minima are shown in figure  [ fig : ursaprim ] and figure  [ fig : ursasec ] . the gettysburg light curves and residuals are shown in figure  [ fig : getty ] . the binary is well detached : the stars occupy only @xmath157% and @xmath152% by volume of their critical equipotential surfaces .",
    "both components are nearly spherical in shape ( oblateness @xmath62 , as defined by * ? ? ?",
    "the secondary eclipse is total , and the fraction of the primary light blocked at phase 0.0 is 40% .",
    "a common problem in solving the light curves of some eclipsing systems is the indeterminacy in the ratio of the radii , particularly when the components are similar and the eclipses partial . as a test , we fitted the ursa light curves with fixed values of @xmath63 over a wide range around the best - fit value of 0.603 .",
    "solutions converged only between 0.55 and 0.63 .",
    "some parameters such as @xmath53 , and to a lesser extent the relative brightness of the secondary ( @xmath64 ) , showed a very strong sensitivity to @xmath63 . only fits in the vicinity of @xmath65 ( which minimizes the sum of residuals squared ) resulted in values of @xmath53 and @xmath64 consistent with the spectroscopic estimates from  [ sec : spectroscopy ] ( after a small correction from the mean wavelength of 5187  to the @xmath37 band ) .",
    "we take this as an indication that the adopted fits are realistic .",
    "10 was observed by the hipparcos satellite under the designation hip  104263 , from december 1989 through february 1993 .",
    "the measured trigonometric parallax is @xmath66  mas .",
    "the photometric variability of the star with the known 2.35-day period was clearly detected in the more than 120 brightness measurements made over the duration of the mission .",
    "additionally , even though the wide orbit in 10 is much too small to be spatially resolved by hipparcos , the astrometric solution revealed perturbations in the motion across the sky that led to its classification as a  variability - induced mover \" ( vim ) .",
    "these perturbations arise from the fact that the center of light of the triple system shifts during the eclipses due to the change in the relative brightness between the binary and the third star .",
    "the shift is approximately 25 milli - arc seconds , which the satellite was able to detect . as a first - order approximation",
    "the hipparcos team assumed the angular separation between the binary and the third star was constant , so that the motion of the photocenter is along a straight line connecting them . with this they were able to infer a lower limit to the separation of approximately 70 mas , and a position angle ( north through east ) for the third star relative to the binary of @xmath67 .",
    "this linear and periodic motion of the photocenter was accounted for in deriving the position , proper motion , and parallax of 10 , as reported in the catalog .    in reality",
    "the third star and the binary are in orbit around each other , and from figure  [ fig : origomc ] the period appears to be of the order of 15 years .",
    "the 3.2-yr interval of the hipparcos observations represents a non - negligible fraction of a cycle , and depending on the orientation of the orbit this may have an impact on the derived parallax and proper motion , as well as the inferred motion of the photocenter .",
    "in fact , turning the problem around , the hipparcos observations can potentially provide valuable constraints on the outer orbit .",
    "thus we incorporate these observations ( in the form of the intermediate astrometric data , or  abscissae residuals \" ) into the orbital solution described next .",
    "due to the much larger orbit of the third star compared to the eclipsing binary in 10 , to first order we assume here that the hierarchical triple system may be separated into an inner orbit and an outer orbit , the latter treated as a  binary \" composed of the third star ( b ) and the center of mass of the eclipsing pair ( a ) .",
    "orbital elements that refer to the outer orbit are indicated below with the subindex  ab \" , and those pertaining to the inner orbit are distinguished with a subindex  a \" .",
    "in addition to providing the spectroscopic elements of the inner orbit , in principle the radial velocity measurements yield also the elements of the outer orbit , except that in our case the coverage is insufficient for that purpose ( see figure  [ fig : rvresiduals ] ) , and the period of the outer orbit ( @xmath68 ) is undetermined . additionally , the semi - amplitudes of the velocity variation in the wide orbit ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) are poorly constrained because the observations do not cover the velocity extrema .",
    "the times of eclipse help in two important ways : they constrain the period ( @xmath1515 years from a preliminary analysis ) , and they constrain the amplitude of the third body effect ( @xmath71 ) , which is directly related to @xmath69 through @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the eccentricity of the outer orbit and @xmath74 is the speed of light .",
    "the fact that the inner binary is eclipsing allows the masses of the three stars to be determined .",
    "for this we incorporate the angle @xmath48 from  [ sec : photometry ] into the solution , along with its uncertainty .",
    "the use of the hipparcos data introduces several other orbital elements into the problem that are constrained by the astrometry , including the inclination angle of the wide orbit ( @xmath75 ) and the position angle of the ascending node ( @xmath76 , referred to the equinox of j2000 ) .",
    "additionally we must solve for corrections to the catalog values of the position of the barycenter ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) at the mean catalog epoch of 1991.25 , corrections to the proper motions ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) , and to the trigonometric parallax ( @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 . ] .",
    "because the inner binary is eclipsing there is redundancy in that the angle @xmath75 can also be derived purely from the spectroscopic elements and the known value of @xmath48 .",
    "we may thus eliminate one parameter , and for practical reasons we have chosen to eliminate @xmath70 and to retain @xmath75 explicitly as an adjustable variable .",
    "altogether there are 19 unknowns in the least - squares problem : \\{@xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 } for the inner orbit , \\{@xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath75 , @xmath73 , @xmath89 , @xmath76 , @xmath90 } for the outer orbit , the center of mass velocity @xmath91 , and the hipparcos - related elements \\{@xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81}. the longitudes of periastron @xmath92 refer to the star or system indicated ; @xmath88 is the time of primary eclipse in the inner orbit , and @xmath90 represents the time of periastron passage in the outer orbit .",
    "the amplitude of the motion of the photocenter in angular units , @xmath93 , is a function of the fractional mass and luminosity of the third star relative to the system as a whole .",
    "it is given by @xmath94 , in which the mass fraction is @xmath95 and the luminosity fraction is @xmath96 . with the definition of third light used in ebop , @xmath97 .",
    "the symbol @xmath98 represents the relative semimajor axis of the wide orbit expressed in angular measure .",
    "the notation @xmath99 is used here to distinguish from the semimajor axis in linear units , @xmath100 .",
    "the mass fraction @xmath40 can be expressed in terms of other elements , and @xmath98 follows from knowledge of @xmath68 , the masses , the parallax , and the application of kepler s third law .",
    "the luminosity fraction @xmath101 needs to be specified in the hipparcos passband ( @xmath102 ) , which is slightly different from johnson @xmath37 . to derive it",
    "we have made use of the hipparcos epoch photometry for 10 , and solved the light curve with ebop . since the measurements available are fewer in number compared to our other light curves , we fixed the geometric elements to the average of the ursa and gettysburg results from table  [ tab : lightelements ] , and solved only for the passband - dependent elements @xmath103 and @xmath53 .",
    "limb - darkening coefficients have little effect and were fixed to their values for the @xmath37 band .",
    "the fit to the hipparcos photometry is shown in figure  [ fig : hiplightcurve ] .",
    "the results we obtained from this adjustment are @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( @xmath102 ) . with this value of @xmath53 the photocentric semimajor axis @xmath93 is completely determined at each iteration of the least - squares problem and is not an additional free parameter in the orbital solution .",
    "the formalism for incorporating the abscissae residuals from hipparcos into the fit follows closely that described by @xcite and @xcite , including the correlations between measurements from the two independent data reduction consortia @xcite .",
    "while the hipparcos observations provide information that is complementary to that from other available measurements , the astrometric constraint on some of the orbital elements is not particularly strong due to the limited precision of those measurements .",
    "typical uncertainties for a single abscissa residual range from 2 to 4 mas , which is only a few times smaller than the motions we are trying to model .",
    "additional constraints may be placed on the parallax by using the physical properties of stars aa and ab derived in  [ sec : dimensions ] , which allow the absolute luminosity of each component to be determined very accurately from their effective temperature and radius .",
    "this is the same principle that has been used to great advantage for applications such as establishing the distance of external galaxies from eclipsing binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from the radii and temperatures in  [ sec : dimensions ] , along with the total apparent magnitude of 10 and the fractional luminosities of the components , we obtain parallax estimates of @xmath106  mas ( aa ) and @xmath107  mas ( ab ) , which are consistent with each other .",
    "we incorporate these estimates into the global solution as  measurements \" , along with their uncertainties .",
    "the delay or advance in the times of eclipse caused by the third star is accounted for as described by @xcite .",
    "the best - fit time of primary eclipse ( @xmath88 ) given below refers to the center of the elliptical orbit of the eclipsing pair around the common center of mass of the triple , as opposed to the barycenter ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for consistency , corrections for light travel time in the inner binary",
    "have also been applied to the dates of the radial velocity observations at each iteration , which has only a minimal effect on the spectroscopic elements .",
    "these corrections range from @xmath108 days to @xmath109 days ( a change of 27 minutes over the 6.7-yr timespan of the velocities ) , and are listed in table  [ tab : rvs ] .",
    "standard non - linear least - squares techniques were used to solve simultaneously for the 19 unknowns that minimize the overall @xmath110 of the observations @xcite .",

    "the semimajor axis of the photocenter of the binary in the wide orbit is only 9.55  mas , but the relative semimajor axis is much larger ( 55.3  mas ) . considering that the orbit is eccentric and therefore that the angular separation can be as large as 80  mas , the third star is potentially resolvable with current techniques ( e.g. , speckle interferometry on 4-m class telescopes , or adaptive optics on 810-m class telescopes ) despite being 2 magnitudes fainter than the binary in the visible .",
    "maximum separation should occur around the year 2014 .",
    "the central surface brightness parameter from the light curve solutions constrains the difference between the effective temperatures of the stars in the binary . to estimate the mean temperature of the system we made use of absolute @xmath129 photometry outside of eclipse available from the work of @xcite , the @xmath130 and @xmath131 magnitudes from the tycho-2 catalog @xcite , and the @xmath132 magnitudes from the 2mass catalog",

    "these correspond to spectral types of approximately f9 and g8 , while the third star is roughly g4 @xcite .",
    "the high precision of the mass and radius determinations for stars aa and ab ( errors of 12% ) , along with the subsolar secondary mass and a mass ratio that is quite different from unity ( @xmath54 ) , make 10 a particularly valuable system to test models of single - star evolution .",
    "the four measured properties available for testing are the mass , radius , effective temperature , and luminosity ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "the latter two are of course related through the stefan - boltzmann law , although they were determined independently here since we know the distance .",
    "because the temperatures were derived somewhat more indirectly and have greater uncertainties than @xmath135 , we have preferred to rely here on the absolute visual magnitudes , inferred from the apparent brightness of the system ( ignoring extinction ; see  [ sec : photometry ] ) , the fractional luminosities , and the parallax .",
    "no accurate estimate of the metallicity is available .",
    "the population  i kinematics (  [ sec : dimensions ] ) provide only circumstancial evidence that the composition is perhaps near solar . in the following",
    "we have made that assumption initially , although non - solar compositions have also been explored by leaving the metallicity as a free parameter . in principle",
    "this additional freedom may appear to weaken the test ; however , in this particular case it has no effect on our main conclusion , as seen below .      in figure",
    "[ fig : yale ] we display the radius and absolute visual magnitude of 10 as a function of mass , along with theoretical isochrones from the yonsei - yale series of evolutionary models @xcite for solar metallicity ( @xmath136 ) . as do most models , these treat convection in the mixing - length approximation , and adopt a mixing - length parameter that best fits the properties of the sun ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "the color transformations and bolometric corrections adopted are from the tables by @xcite .",
    "the figure shows that , within the errors , a 3.4-gyr isochrone for this metallicity provides an excellent match to all observations except for the radius of the secondary , which is @xmath1510% larger than predicted .",
    "this very significant difference is 5 times the uncertainty .",
    "since the luminosity of the secondary is well reproduced by the models , it follows that the effective temperature must be cooler than predicted .",
    "indeed , our estimate from  [ sec : dimensions ] is @xmath138  k , formally cooler than the predicted value of 5460  k but only at the 1@xmath16 level .",
    "a more precise estimate of the secondary temperature may be derived from our @xmath135 and the radius of the star ( with bolometric corrections taken also from * ? ? ? * for consistency ) .",
    "this gives @xmath139  k , which is lower than the models predict at a more significant 3.1@xmath16 level .",
    "thus the secondary does appear to be too cool by roughly 200 k.    extensive tests show that adjustments in the age or metallicity of the isochrones do not improve the agreement .",
    "figure  [ fig : metage]a illustrates this in the age / metallicity plane .",
    "the shaded areas represent all isochrones that are consistent with the measured mass , radius , and @xmath135 of each star within the estimated uncertainties .",
    "the shaded areas do not overlap , meaning that no single isochrone can reproduce all properties of both stars simultaneously .",
    "the region spanned by models that are consistent with the primary properties ( [ fe / h ] within @xmath1400.14 dex of solar , ages of 3.063.78 gyr ) are shown in the mass / radius and mass/@xmath135 diagrams in figures  [ fig : metage]b and [ fig : metage]c .",
    "none of those models come close to matching the radius of the secondary star , although they do agree well with its absolute magnitude , as stated above .    as a test we repeated the comparison using a different set of isochrones by @xcite , from the padova group . in these models",
    "the adopted mixing - length parameter that best reproduces the sun ( for @xmath141 ) is @xmath142 , and a number of other physical ingredients are somewhat different , as are the color transformations and bolometric corrections .",
    "nevertheless , the fits to 10 are very similar , and again indicate a large discrepancy in the secondary radius @xmath143 and a smaller difference in temperature .    both of the above sets of evolutionary models adopt a grey approximation for the outer boundary conditions to the internal stucture equations .",
    "more sophisticated non - grey atmospheres have been used in the models by @xcite and @xcite , which has been shown to be important for low mass stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , these models incorporate an improved equation of state and other refinements , although all this should only have an impact for stars considerably smaller than the secondary of 10 ( which is near the calibration point at 1  m@xmath2 ) . indeed , the comparison between 10 and the @xcite isochrones ( @xmath144 , @xmath145 ) is not very different from the two previous fits , and yields a similar age as before based on the agreement with all observed properties except @xmath143 .",
    "the measured radii depend mainly on the results from the light curve fits and to a lesser degree on the spectroscopy . as described earlier , tests carried out during the analysis of both types of data make it very unlikely that either set of results is biased enough to explain the discrepancy . since the properties of the more massive primary star appear to be well reproduced by the models ( as expected from previous experience ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suspicion falls on our theoretical understanding of stars under a solar mass .",
    "similar evidence has been presented over the last several years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but in fact indications go as far back as the work by @xcite , @xcite , and others .",
    "all of these studies have shown that theoretical calculations for stars less massive than the sun tend to underestimate the radius by as much as 10% to 20% .",
    "temperature differences also appear to be present , as in 10 .",
    "the models by @xcite we used above are also available for lower values of the mixing length parameter in the mass range of interest . in figure",
    "[ fig : baraffe ] we compare the observations for 10 against solar metallicity models for @xmath17 and 1.5 , in addition to @xmath146 , adjusting the age to satisfy the constraints on the primary star within the errors .",
    "a 2.6-gyr isochrone with @xmath17 provides a significantly better fit to the secondary radius than the one with @xmath146 used earlier , although the model prediction still falls short of the observed @xmath143 value by about 1.8@xmath16 at the measured mass .",
    "the reduced convection implied by the lower mixing length parameter in these models compared to the previous ones has the effect of increasing the theoretical radii and slightly lowering the effective temperatures .",
    "the predicted temperature for @xmath17 and @xmath147 is 5110 k , somewhat closer than before to the empirical result of 5210 k ( see above ) .",
    "the considerably smaller value of @xmath14 apparently required by a star so close to the solar mass as 10 ab is perhaps somewhat surprising , although other studies have found similar evidence in some stars and have even argued for a mass dependence , with smaller values of @xmath14 for later - type stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the observational evidence for this is often contradictory ( see * ? ? ?",
    "theoretical studies , on the other hand , have tended to predict the opposite dependence with mass @xcite .",
    "further clues on these disagreements may be gained from looking at other eclipsing binary systems with well determined properties . to avoid any possible dependence on mass",
    ", we focus here on binaries having at least one star in the same mass range as the secondary of 10 .",
    "three such systems are available with reliable determinations of the mass , radius , and temperature good to better than 3% : rw  lac @xcite , in which the primary is within 0.5% of the mass of 10  ab ; fl  lyr , with a secondary only 3% more massive ; and hs  aur , with a primary that is 3.5% less massive .",
    "the latter two are from work by @xcite and @xcite , and fl  lyr has the added advantage that the components have quite dissimilar masses ( as in the case of 10 ) , which provides increased leverage for the test .",
    "the main properties of these systems are collected in table  [ tab : otherstars ] , along with 10 and the sun for reference .",
    "two additional systems ( cg  cyg and rt  and ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have one component in the same mass range , but the temperature determinations are considerably more uncertain and are thus less useful for our purposes .    we compared the measurements for rw  lac , fl  lyr , and hs  aur to the yonsei - yale models in the same way we did for v1061 cyg , adjusting the age and metallicity of the isochrones to obtain the best possible fit ( see figure  [ fig : otherstars ] ) .",
    "fl  lyr is seen to present the same problem as 10 : the secondary appears too large compared to theory , by about the same amount as we saw before ( @xmath1510% ) , while the properties of primary are well fit . on the other hand ,",
    "the primary of rw  lac is virtually identical in mass to 10 ab yet it shows no indication of a radius discrepancy .",
    "the primary in hs  aur also seems to be well reproduced by the models ( as well as the secondary ) , within the errors .    a pattern that may explain why stars of very similar mass sometimes appear too large , while other times they conform well to theory , is seen in the activity level they present .",
    "both 10 ab and fl  lyr b , which show the radius discrepancy , are in relatively tight systems with orbital periods of only 2.35 days and 2.18 days , respectively .",
    "the stars in these binaries are rapid rotators ( consistent with synchronous rotation maintained by tidal forces ) : 10 ab has a measured @xmath148  (  [ sec : spectroscopy ] ) and fl  lyr b has @xmath149  @xcite .",
    "both binaries are strong rosat x - ray sources @xcite and their x - ray luminosities ( table  [ tab : otherstars ] ) are in line with those of active single and binary stars with similar @xmath8 values ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although to our knowledge no observations exist to verify whether the h and k lines are in emission , both systems show signs of intrinsic variability in the light curve suggesting the presence of spots ( see popper et al .",
    "1986 for fl  lyr , and ",
    "[ sec : photometry ] for 10 ) .",
    "they are thus active binaries .",
    "rw  lac and hs  aur , on the other hand , do not show a radius discrepancy and happen to have much longer orbital periods of 10.37 days and 9.82 days , respectively , and their components are slow rotators .",
    "no emission is seen in hs  aur @xcite .",
    "neither binary was detected as an x - ray source by rosat @xcite , and by all accounts they appear inactive .",
    "a direct relation is thus seen for stars of the same mass between the activity level and the increased stellar size compared to predictions from standard models ( i.e. , those adopting a mixing length parameter matching the sun ) : _ active stars are larger , and inactive ones appear normal_. the evidence for 10 and other later - type stars also indicates that active stars are cooler .",
    "this seems to have been mentioned only as a possibility ( among several others ) in previous studies reporting radius discrepancies for stars under a solar mass , at least those originating from the eclipsing binary community .",
    "but as a matter of fact , the connection between activity and the global properties of low mass stars has been studied in some detail previously in a slightly different context , although without direct and precise knowledge of the masses and radii of the stars involved .",
    "@xcite investigated the effects of magnetic fields on the sizes and effective temperatures of active versus inactive m dwarfs , and found empirical evidence that a higher activity level leads to larger radii and cooler temperatures .",
    "their sample consisted of single stars with effective temperature determinations from infrared spectroscopy and bolometric luminosities from multi - band photometry , from which stellar radii were inferred indirectly with typical uncertainties of 1015% . although their work focussed mainly on the consequences for the internal structure of fully convective stars , their initial attempts at modeling magnetic fields were successful in describing these effects to first order . the present study on 10 shows the activity - radius connection clearly for stars with accurately determined dynamical masses , radii , and temperatures good to 13% .",
    "more importantly , the effect is seen for objects that are only 7% less massive than the sun .",
    "a theoretical understanding of this connection is also not new , and provides some insight into the better agreement between the observations for 10 and the low-@xmath14 models in figure  [ fig : baraffe ] .",
    "strong magnetic fields commonly associated with chromospheric activity have been shown to inhibit the efficiency of convective heat transport ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and as a result the size of the star must grow larger to radiate away the same amount of energy .",
    "the decreased convection effectively leads to a lower value of the mixing length parameter ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which explains the better fit to the radius of the secondary using the @xcite models with @xmath17 as opposed to those with the solar value of @xmath146 .",
    "similar improvements in the fit to other low - mass stars using a reduced mixing length parameter were also reported by @xcite , and in fact much earlier by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the enhanced activity in 10 ab is driven by rapid ( synchronous ) rotation induced by tidal forces .",
    "the primary star is rotating even more rapidly ( @xmath150  ) , yet it shows no obvious indication of a significantly larger radius compared to standard models .",
    "this is most likely because it is a more massive star ( spectral type f9 , @xmath151  m@xmath2 ) and therefore its convective envelope ( where magnetic activity takes place ) is significantly reduced . to illustrate this in a more quantitative way",
    ", figure  [ fig : envelope ] shows the mass of the convective envelope for main - sequence stars as a function of stellar mass from the models by @xcite , for solar composition and the age of 3.4  gyr we infer for the system . in the lower panel the envelope mass",
    "is expressed as a percentage of the stellar mass .",
    "the inset shows an enlargement of the region relevant to 10 . according to these models the convective envelope of the secondary represents about 4.7% of its total mass ,",
    "whereas that of the primary is only 0.2% ( @xmath1520 times smaller ) . a similarly reduced convective envelope for the primary of fl  lyr ( @xmath152  m@xmath2 ) explains why that star also does not show evidence of an enlarged radius , while the secondary ( which is similar in mass to 10 ab ) does .",
    "the extent to which a star is enlarged by this effect may be expected to depend upon the strength of the activity .",
    "we note , for instance , that although models with @xmath17 seem to match the radius of 10 ab better , the same models still do not reproduce the properties of apparently more active lower - mass stars such as yy  gem @xcite , cu  cnc @xcite , gu  boo @xcite , and others .",
    "it is clear that further examples of stars ( both active and inactive ) in the suitable mass range with accurately determined parameters are needed to explore this .",
    "systems such as 10 and fl  lyr , with components of appreciably different mass and primaries that are larger than @xmath151.2  m@xmath2 , are particularly useful because they allow the activity - radius effect to be separated out , since the primary should not be significantly affected .",
    "the 10 system is especially valuable for containing a third star of mass indistinguishable from that of the active star ab , but with slow rotation .",
    "it is presumably an inactive analog of the secondary , with the same age and chemical composition , and is thus ideal for testing the effect discussed above .",
    "we do not have a direct measurement of its size , but the radius can be inferred from the effective temperature and luminosity , and is @xmath153  r@xmath2 . while this is formally smaller than the secondary radius of @xmath154  r@xmath2 , as we expected , it is not precise enough for a definitive test .",
    "other inferred properties of the tertiary are listed in table  [ tab : physics ] .",
    "the star is represented graphically in figure  [ fig : otherstars ] , where it is seen to be in good agreement with the isochrone for the primary , within the admittedly large errors .",
    "the effective temperature we determine for the tertiary ( @xmath155 k ) is somewhat hotter than that of the secondary even though the masses are similar , which again is consistent with our conclusion that the activity in the secondary has made that star cooler .",
    "the formal uncertainty in @xmath156 is dominated by errors in the light fraction @xmath53 and effective temperature @xmath157 , in that order of importance .",
    "improvements in the former could be made , for example , by direct detection of the third star and measurement of its brightness through speckle interferometry or adaptive optics imaging (  [ sec : dimensions ] ) .",
    "a better temperature estimate would require spectroscopy with higher s / n , although the triple - lined nature of the spectrum and the faintness of the star would still pose a challenge .",
    "additional radial velocity measurements over the coming years covering the next nodal passage in the outer orbit ( in 2009.1 ) would also be important to refine the value of the tertiary mass .",
    "the results of our spectroscopic , photometric , and astrometric analyses of the 10 system have taken us in a rather different direction than we anticipated when we began this study .",
    "the possible status of the object as an example of the rare class of cool algols is now clearly ruled out .",
    "instead , we have shown here that it is a hierarchical triple system with an outer period of 15.8  yr , in which the eclipsing inner pair is well detached , is composed of main - sequence stars , has a mass ratio quite different from unity , and has a secondary that is slightly below a solar mass .",
    "the absolute masses and radii for the binary components are determined with a relative precision of 2% or better , and the mass of the third star is good to 4% .    while the primary star is well fit in mass , radius , temperature , and luminosity by standard stellar evolution models with a metallicity near solar and a mixing length parameter set by the calibration to the sun , the secondary appears @xmath1510% too large .",
    "this discrepancy is 5 times the size of the observational errors , and quite surprising for a star that differs by only 7% in mass from the sun .",
    "there are also indications that it is cooler than predicted by some 200 k. 10 is yet another example highlighting our incomplete understanding of the structure and evolution of stars in the lower main sequence .",
    "similar differences in size and temperature have been noticed previously for lower - mass stars with accurately measured properties , but the source of the problem has remained unclear . by comparing 10 ab to several other objects of nearly the same mass",
    "we have identified the activity level as a key factor distinguishing cases that show the radius discrepancy from those that do not .",
    "this link between activity and increased radius has been mentioned in the literature before , but is shown here for the first time for stars with accurately known masses , radii , and temperatures .",
    "it is often stated that the structure and evolution of stars ( particularly those close to a solar mass ) are completely determined once the chemical composition and mass are specified .",
    "it is quite clear now that for stars of order 1  m@xmath2 or less an additional parameter must be taken into account , which has to do with the level of chromospheric activity . whether this parameter is directly the rotational speed ( e.g. , @xmath8 ) or period , the magnetic field strength , the rossby number ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or some other more complicated activity indicator remains to be determined . to first order it appears that the effective mixing length may be a useful proxy , but with one exception current stellar evolution models are not publicly available for more than one value of @xmath14 , so testing this is somewhat difficult in practice .",
    "if the predictions from the models are to reach an accuracy matching current observations of low - mass stars ( @xmath1512% relative errors in the masses and radii ) , this effect can no longer be ignored .",
    "further progress will require more examples of binary systems with well determined physical parameters and different levels of activity in the relevant mass regime in order to help calibrate any such parameter .",
    "testing models of single - star evolution by means of eclipsing binaries , as astronomers have done for decades , might perhaps be seen as part of the problem since the enhanced activity displayed by many of these systems is a direct result of tidal synchronization that occurs only in close binaries .",
    "although wider eclipsing pairs with inactive components under 1  m@xmath2 certainly do exist , they are less common and in some respects more difficult to study .",
    "stars near the bottom of the main sequence , m dwarfs in particular , are found to be active more often than not .",
    "the effects of magnetic fields on the evolution of stars have already begun to be explored by theorists ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* although the latter authors focus on more massive stars ) , and initial comparisons with observations are encouraging . one area where this is likely to have a significant impact is the study of t  tauri stars , which are typically very active . even in substellar objects such as",

    "<S> we present spectroscopic and photometric observations of the eclipsing system 10 , previously thought to be a member of the rare class of  cool algols \" . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is instead a hierarchical triple system in which the inner eclipsing pair ( with @xmath0 days ) is composed of main - sequence stars and is well detached , and the third star is also visible in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we combine the radial velocities for the three stars , times of eclipse , and intermediate astrometric data from the hipparcos mission ( abscissae residuals ) to establish the elements of the outer orbit , which is eccentric and has a period of 15.8 yr . </S>",
    "<S> we determine accurate values for the masses , radii , and effective temperatures of the binary components : @xmath1  m@xmath2 , @xmath3  r@xmath2 , and @xmath4  k for the primary ( star aa ) , and @xmath5  m@xmath2 , @xmath6  r@xmath2 , and @xmath7  k for the secondary ( ab ) . </S>",
    "<S> the masses and radii have relative errors of only 12% . </S>",
    "<S> both stars are rotating rapidly ( @xmath8 values are @xmath9  and @xmath10  ) and have their rotation synchronized with the orbital motion </S>",
    "<S> . there are signs of activity including strong x - ray emission and possibly spots . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the tertiary is determined to be @xmath11  m@xmath2 and its effective temperature is @xmath12  k. the system is at a distance of @xmath13 pc . </S>",
    "<S> current stellar evolution models that use a mixing length parameter @xmath14 appropriate for the sun agree well with the properties of the primary , but show a very large discrepancy in the radius of the secondary , in the sense that the predicted values are @xmath1510% smaller than observed ( a @xmath155@xmath16 effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the temperature is cooler than predicted by some 200  k. these discrepancies are quite remarkable given that the star is only 7% less massive than the sun , the calibration point of all stellar models . </S>",
    "<S> similar differences have been seen before for later - type stars , but the source of the problem has remained unclear . a comparison with the properties of other stars of similar mass as the secondary in 10 has allowed us to identify the chromospheric activity as the likely cause of the effect . </S>",
    "<S> inactive stars agree very well with the models , while active ones such as 10 ab appear systematically too large and too cool . </S>",
    "<S> theory provides an understanding of this in terms of the strong magnetic fields commonly associated with stellar activity , which tend to inhibit convective heat transport . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced convection explains why fits to models with a smaller mixing length parameter of @xmath17 seem to give better agreement with the observations for 10  ab . </S>"
