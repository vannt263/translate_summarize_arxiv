    "frequency conversion of quantum states of light and redistribution of optical information between different quantum fields is an important and desirable tool for interfacing of quantum communication lines with photon memory units .",
    "quantum frequency conversion ( qfc ) with preserving a quantum state has been hitherto realized in the nonlinear crystals using the process of parametric up - conversion @xcite . for implementation of qfc in atomic ensembles , a technique for light storage and",
    "its subsequent retrieval @xcite at another optical frequency under the conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite was employed . however , despite the success of proof - of - principle experiments performed in a four - level double @xmath0-type atomic medium @xcite , to date no true demonstration of information - preserving frequency conversion has been given .",
    "the major difficulties inherent to these schemes are unavoidable losses and shape distortion of a weak ( quantum ) light pulse during its storage and retrieval by means of eit .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a protocol for qfc in atomic ensembles free from the above drawbacks .",
    "our method makes use of recently demonstrated @xcite efficient parametric coupling between two single - photon pulses propagating in a slow - light medium .",
    "the latter is an ensemble of atoms which interact with two quantum fields in a v - type configuration , while the upper electric - dipole forbidden transition is driven by a classical and constant field inducing a magnetic dipole or an electric quadrupole transition between the two upper levels ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the role of classical field is twofold .",
    "first , it creates parametric coupling between the photons and , second , it induces medium transparency for the intensity values where the eit conditions are fulfilled for both quantum fields .",
    "it is clear , however , that implementation of the medium transparency leads evidently to degradation of parametric interaction between the fields .",
    "nevertheless , we demonstrate below how an incoming signal - photon    state is efficiently converted under eit conditions into second optical mode in a lossless manner conserving at the same time the pulse shape and initial entanglement .",
    "the easiest way to realize this is obviously the case of equal group velocities of quantum fields , which , however , is almost never met in practice ( see below ) .",
    "meanwhile , for realistic atomic systems , we predict the conversion efficiency as high as @xmath1 .",
    "in essence , while the process involves only one photon at a time , this system allows for the realization of strong interaction of individual photons with each other , even if the two pulses propagate in the medium with different group velocities .",
    "our approach offers another important advantage : unlike the previous proposals for qfc based on the light storage and its retrieval , we apply here only one and , moreover , constant driving field for control the conversion efficiency that makes our method much favorable for future applications",
    ". one obvious limitation of considered process is that it is effective in a relatively narrow frequency range associated with specific atoms .",
    "we note , however , that recently a source of narrow - band , frequency tunable single photons with properties allowing exciting the narrow atomic resonances has been created @xcite .    in next section",
    "we briefly describe a three - level model for parametric interaction between two quantum fields and give the analytic solution for the field operators obtained in @xcite .",
    "then , in section iii we calculate the intensities of quantum fields and find the conversion efficiency , as well as discuss the ability of the system to convert coherently the photons with wavelengths in different spectral ranges . in section iv we analyze the quantum properties of frequency conversion process and show how a partial conversion leads to generation of frequency entangled single - photon state .",
    "finally , in section iv we summarize our results .",
    "we outline here an approach that allows the propagation dynamics to be solved exactly , while the detailed description of the model can be found in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "we consider an ensemble of cold atoms with level configuration depicted in fig.1 .",
    "two quantum fields @xmath2+h.c.\\ ] ] co - propagate along the @xmath3 axis and interact with the atoms on the transitions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , while the upper electric - dipole forbidden transition @xmath6 is driven by a classical and constant field with real rabi frequency @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the quantization volume taken to be equal to interaction volume .",
    "the electric fields are expressed in terms of the operators @xmath9 , and the medium is described using atomic operators @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 averaged over the volume containing many atoms @xmath13 around position @xmath3 , where @xmath14 is the total number of atoms and @xmath15 is the length of the medium . in the rotating wave picture the interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath16 @xmath17\\ ] ] here @xmath18  is the projection of the wave - vector of the driving field on the @xmath3 axis , @xmath19 is the atom - field coupling constants with @xmath20 being the dipole matrix element of the atomic transition @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that the process is running at low temperature in order to avoid the doppler broadening , which in a cold atomic sample is smaller than all relaxation rates , and consider the case of exactly resonant interaction with all fields .    to implement our qfc scheme in a dense atomic medium",
    ", several conditions must be satisfied .",
    "first , the photon absorption must be strongly reduced @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 , are the field absorption coefficients , and @xmath25 are the optical transverse relaxation rates involving , apart from natural decay rates @xmath26 of the excited states 1 and 2 , the dephasing rates in corresponding transitions .",
    "the latter are caused by atomic collisions and escape of atoms from the laser beam .",
    "however , in the ensemble of cold atoms the both effects are negligibly small compared to @xmath26 , so that @xmath27=@xmath28 .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath29 is a sum of the partial decay rate of @xmath30-th upper level to the ground state 0 and the rate of population leak from the @xmath30-th level towards the states outside of the system .",
    "the limit of eq.(2 ) is readily achieved , if the condition of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath31 is satisfied for both transitions coupled to the weak - fields .",
    "note that the three - level configurations 0 - 2 - 1 and 0 - 1 - 2 form the @xmath0- and ladder eit - systems with the decoherence time @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "second , the initial spectrum of quantum fields should be contained within the eit window @xmath34 @xcite , resulting in little pulse distortion from absorption , i.e. @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the initial pulse width , @xmath37 is the optical depth , @xmath38 is the resonant absorption cross - section , and @xmath39 is the atomic number density .",
    "it is also desirable that the pulse broadening should be minimal .",
    "the source of the latter is the various orders of dispersion , beginning from the group - velocity dispersion proportional to the second time derivative of the fields @xmath40 .",
    "the change in pulse width due to this term after propagating through the medium can be roughly estimated by treating the weak fields for a time classically and ignoring the parametric contribution to broadening .",
    "then , for an initial gaussian pulse @xmath41 , the simple calculations yield @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the pulse group velocity .",
    "it is seen that the spreading of the quantum pulses caused by the group - velocity dispersion can be neglected , if @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the pulse propagation time and , in fact , the pulse delay relative to the pulse which travels the same distance in vacuum .",
    "it is worth noting that upon satisfying the condition ( 4 ) , the pulse broadening due to next orders of dispersion is more suppressed .",
    "in @xcite we have shown that under the conditions ( 2 - 4 ) the propagation equations for the quantum field operators , in the slowly varying envelope approximation , take the simple form : @xmath46@xmath47 where @xmath48 is the coupling constant of parametric interaction between the quantum fields and decreases with increase of coupling field intensity .",
    "the formal solution of eqs.(6,7 ) in the region @xmath49 is given by @xmath50@xmath51where @xmath52  and @xmath53 the bessel function @xmath54 depends on @xmath3 via @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the difference of group velocities .",
    "in deriving this solution we have assumed that the phase - matching condition @xmath57 is fulfilled in the medium .    in the limit of equal group velocities",
    "@xmath58 the eqs .",
    "( 7 ) are reduced to a simple form @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "note , however , that this case is practically never realized , since the atom - field coupling constants @xmath62 and @xmath63 are defined by the partial decay rates of upper atomic 1 and 2 levels into the ground state @xmath64 , which are different even if the total decay rates are the same @xmath65 , as is the case , for example , in a v - type atoms with hyperfine - level structure .",
    "our aim is to show that the proposed scheme is suitable for converting individual photons at one frequency to another frequency while preserving initial quantum coherence that results in a generation of frequency - entangled single - photon state . to this end",
    "we analyze the evolution of the input state @xmath66 consisting of a single - photon wave packet at @xmath67 frequency , while @xmath68 field is in the vacuum state .",
    "the similar results are clearly obtained in the case of one input photon at @xmath68 frequency .",
    "we assume that initially the @xmath67 pulse is localized around @xmath69 with a given temporal profile @xmath70 : @xmath71 in free space , @xmath72 and we have @xmath73the intensities of the fields at any distance in the region @xmath49 are given by@xmath74 the quantum efficiency ( qe ) is determined as the ratio @xmath75 , where @xmath76 are the mean photon numbers and @xmath77 are the dimensionless operators for number of photons that pass each point on the z axis in the whole time @xmath78    using eqs.(7 , 9 - 12 ) and recalling that @xmath79 , we calculate @xmath80 numerically and show in fig.2 the qe as a function of driving field rabi frequency @xmath81 in the case of a gaussian input pulse @xmath82 $ ] , which is normalized as @xmath83 indicating that the number of impinged photons is one .",
    "the atomic sample is chosen to be @xmath84 vapor with the ground state @xmath85 and exited states @xmath86 , @xmath87 as the atomic states @xmath64 and @xmath88 in fig.1 , respectively . for calculations we used the following parameters : light wavelength of quantum fields @xmath89 = 795 nm and @xmath90 = 780 nm , @xmath91 mhz , atomic density @xmath92@xmath93 in a trap of length @xmath94 @xmath95 m , and the input pulse duration @xmath96 ns , for which we have @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "all of these parameters appear to be within experimental reach , including the initial single - photon wave packets with a pulse length of several tens of nanoseconds @xcite , as well as high power narrow - band cw thz radiation at a frequency @xmath100 thz @xcite resonant to the fine splitting @xmath101 in rubidium .",
    "it is worth noting that in most cases of alkali atoms the spectral separation between @xmath102 and @xmath103 lines lies in the operation range of tunable terahertz silicon and quantum cascade lasers @xcite that may give novel important applications of thz radiation such as implementation of qfc in atomic ensembles .    in fig.2 we do not show the region of small values of @xmath81 , where the solution eq.(7 ) is not valid .",
    "it is seen that the qe reaches its maximum @xmath1 at @xmath104 , which is very close to the corresponding value of @xmath81 following from eq.(8 ) for equal group velocities . to demonstrate the shape - conserving character of frequency conversion in our scheme we present in fig.3 the results for two different shapes of initial @xmath105 pulse .",
    "fig.3a shows the case of gaussian shaped input pulse having a duration t , while in fig.3b the latter is taken as two superimposed gaussian pulses of the same duration t. it is seen that in both cases the generated @xmath106 mode reproduces almost identically the initial form of the input @xmath105 pulse , which is evidently a direct consequence of linear relationship between quantum fields in eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) .    at other values of @xmath81 the incoming @xmath67 field",
    "is converted into @xmath68 mode not completely , but different amount of mode conversion is attainable , thus enabling redistribution of quantum information between the two quantum fields . by adjusting the driving field intensity",
    ", a single - photon state entangled over the two optical modes @xmath67 and @xmath68 with the given intensities can be generated .",
    "in particular , such a state with equal intensities of the modes is created for two values of @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( fig.4 ) , which , however , are different in their physical content .",
    "the higher values of @xmath81 correspond to large group velocities of the pulses , while the parametric coupling is reduced . as a result , during propagation in the medium the @xmath67 field has time to be converted into @xmath68 mode only partially and , owing to @xmath109 , the @xmath68 pulse is slightly delayed with respect to the signal @xmath67 pulse that is just observed in fig.4 ( left column ) . on the contrary , at small values of @xmath81 the pulses travel slower , while the parametric coupling is enhanced .",
    "consequently , first the @xmath67 field is almost completely converted into the @xmath68 pulse at small distances ( nearly 60 @xmath110 ) , and then the latter is partially transformed back into the @xmath67 photon at the end ( 100@xmath111 ) of the medium .",
    "this time the newly generated @xmath67 pulse is clearly behind the @xmath68 pulse ( fig.4 , right column ) with a delay which is longer than in the previous case . by these",
    "any input optical mode is split into two optical modes of different frequencies in a controllable way preserving at the same time the total number of photons , which is determined in each mode by the areas of the corresponding peaks . in the absence of losses ,",
    "the conservation law for photon numbers follows from eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) as @xmath112with taking into account that @xmath113 . at the input of the medium @xmath114=1 and @xmath115=0 , so that from eq.(13 ) one has @xmath116=1 .",
    "so far we considered the pulses with a duration comparable to the lifetime of atomic 1 and 2 levels .",
    "however , the conditions ( 2 - 4 ) do not limit critically the pulse length provided that the spectral bandwidth of quantum fields is still negligible compared to the separation between the upper atomic levels .",
    "these conditions can be easily satisfied also for ultrashort pulses , if low atomic densities ( lower by several orders of magnitude ) are used @xcite , thus making our scheme able for efficient frequency conversion in this case as well , which is a permanent need in quantum communication tasks .",
    "thus , by combining the clear properties of parametric interaction between the photons with that the converted light is within the narrow atomic resonant width , one can significantly expand the ability to distribute the quantum states of narrowband spectra .",
    "above we have demonstrated this possibility in the case of small frequency difference of converted photons that can be used , in particular , for addressable excitation of registers of quantum computers , which may be trapped ions or atoms , atomic ensembles , quantum dots etc . at the same time , there is considerable interest in exploring similar mechanisms that enable coherent conversion of photons with much larger difference in wavelengths .",
    "such a mechanism would enable quantum information to be passed over long distances by telecom fibers , which impose the infrared ( ir ) wavelengths , and then to be mapped into the states of atoms , which interact resonantly with quantum fields at visible frequencies . within our approach , the required frequency conversion is easily realized by slightly modifying the interaction configuration in fig.1 and applying a second classical field on the transition @xmath117 with the rabi frequency @xmath118 ( fig.5a ) .",
    "the details of this analysis will be published elsewhere .",
    "here we only outline how the same high conversion efficiency as in the previous case is obtained , but now for @xmath105 and @xmath106 light modes , which are in the visible and ir regions , respectively .",
    "[ scale = 0.75]fig5.ps    in fig.5a the quantum fields @xmath119 and @xmath120 have equal one - photon detuning @xmath121 , while the driving fields @xmath81 and @xmath118 are exactly resonant with the corresponding transitions .",
    "we suppose @xmath122 , so that the bare atomic states 0 and 3 are split into a doublet of dressed states @xmath123 , which are well separated by 2@xmath118 . if now @xmath124 , then taking into account that in this case the excitation of the atoms from @xmath125 can be neglected , since it is strongly suppressed by the factor of @xmath126 , the interaction scheme is reduced to fig.5b , where @xmath127 serves as the ground state(correspondingly , for alternative choose @xmath128 , the ground state of modified system is @xmath125 ) , thus making this scheme identical to that of fig.1 . under the approximations of eqs.(2,3,4 ) , we obtain for quantum field operators the same maxwell equations ( 5,6 ) with new parametric coupling constant @xmath129 , where @xmath130 in denominator emerges from the fact that only a half of the atoms in ground state take part in the process and the atom - field coupling constants @xmath62 and @xmath63 decrease by factor @xmath131 .",
    "a key feature of this model is that @xmath62 and @xmath63 are approximately equal .",
    "note that this is not the case in fig.1 , if we take here @xmath105 and @xmath106 in different regions of spectrum , and thereby the conditions ( 2 - 4 ) can not be satisfied for both quantum fields @xmath132 simultaneously . as an illustration to the modified model in fig.5",
    ", we again consider the sample of @xmath84 vapor with the states @xmath133 , and @xmath134 being the atomic states 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 of fig.5a , respectively . in this case",
    "the quantum field wavelengths are @xmath135 and @xmath136 1,47@xmath110 and @xmath137 that provides high efficiency of ir field conversion into the visible domain and vice versa .",
    "now we discuss the quantum properties of output single - photon state .",
    "we describe it in terms of quantized wave packets at the frequencies @xmath105 and @xmath106 containing the mean photon numbers @xmath138 , where @xmath139 are the wave functions of the modes . using eq.(12 ) and",
    "the commutation relations @xcite @xmath140=\\frac{l}{c}\\delta _ { ij}\\delta ( t - t^{\\prime})\\ ] ] we obtain the output single - photon state as the eigenstate of total photon number operator @xmath141 which yields @xmath142\\mid 0\\rangle\\ ] ] let us introduce the operators of creation of single - photon wave packets at frequencies @xmath143 associated with mode functions @xmath144 , where @xmath30 labels the members of the denumerably infinite set .",
    "for @xmath145 they are given by @xmath146 with the normalization constants @xmath147 these operators create the single - particle states in the usual way by acting on the vacuum state @xmath148 @xmath149 and have the standard boson commutation relations @xmath150=\\delta_{ij}\\ ] ] following from eq.(14 ) .",
    "note that this definition of quantized wave packets is only useful , if the mode spectra are much narrower compared to the mode spacing that has been suggested from the very beginning .",
    "now , for the algebra ( 18 ) we choose the representation of infinite product of all vacua @xmath151 however , since in our problem we deal with two frequency modes , while the other modes are not occupied by the photons and , hence , are not taken into account during the measurements , the vacuum may be reduced to @xmath152 .",
    "then the single - photon state ( 15 ) can be written as @xmath153 @xmath154 with @xmath155 .",
    "thus , in general case of @xmath156 , the system produces a photonic qubit , i.e. , a single - photon state entangled in two distinct frequency modes with the known wave functions @xmath157 .",
    "the complete conversion of input @xmath105 mode depicted in fig.3 corresponds to pure output state @xmath158 .",
    "finally , we demonstrate the persistence of initial quantum coherence and entanglement within the qfc in a simple case of input single - photon state entangled in two well - separated temporal modes or time - bins @xcite(the concept of the single - photon entanglement is discussed in @xcite ) @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 denote fock states with zero and one @xmath105 photon , respectively , at the time @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "suppose that the single - photon wave packets @xmath161 and @xmath164 are characterized by temporal profiles @xmath165 and @xmath166 , respectively , which are not overlapped in time due to large time shift @xmath167 .",
    "then , using the eqs.(7 ) and ( 10 ) , the wave function of output @xmath106 mode is readily calculated to be @xmath168 where @xmath169 with @xmath170 .",
    "consequently , from eq.(16 ) the creation operator @xmath171 can be represented as a sum of creation operators of the two temporal modes at @xmath106 frequency . following the procedure discussed above the output state in the case of complete conversion ( @xmath172 )",
    "is eventually found in the form @xmath173 showing that the initial @xmath105 qubit is transformed into another at @xmath106 frequency with the same complex amplitudes @xmath174 and @xmath175 , thus preserving the original amount of entanglement .",
    "two different methods are available for experimental test of coherence transfer during the frequency conversion . in the first case ,",
    "following the work @xcite the single - photon interference for incoming and outgoing photons can be measured and compared to each other , thus revealing an equal phase periodicity in the two interference patterns in agreement with eqs.(21 ) and ( 22 ) .",
    "the second method @xcite is based on photon - pair interference ; the input @xmath105 photon is first nonclassically correlated with another photon at @xmath176 , which does not take part in the frequency conversion process .",
    "then , after complete conversion of the @xmath105 photon into @xmath106 photon , the entanglement will arise between the @xmath106 and @xmath176 photons and , hence , the strong two - photon interference between the latter will demonstrate the transfer of input qubit at @xmath105 frequency into another at @xmath177 frequency .",
    "to realize this program for narrowband fields , as is the case here , we propose to employ the duan , lukin , cirac , and zoller ( dlcz ) protocol @xcite for generation of nonclassically correlated pair of stokes @xmath105- and anti - stokes @xmath176-photons .",
    "note that the key features of dlcz protocol have been confirmed in many experiments , including strong quantum correlations between @xmath105 and @xmath176 fields @xcite .",
    "summarizing , we have proposed and analyzed a simple scheme of parametric frequency conversion of optical quantum information in atomic ensembles . we have demonstrated remarkable properties of this scheme such as minimal loss and distortion of the pulse shape and the persistence of initial quantum coherence and entanglement that make it superior against the previous schemes of the qfc in atomic media based on release of stored light state via eit .",
    "moreover , the narrowband property of single photons and high efficiency of entanglement generation profit the present mechanism to serve as an ideal candidate for frequency conversion and redistribution of optical information in quantum information processing and quantum networking .                                        remind that completely another pattern is observed in case of short pulses , but for the same values of other parameters chosen in the text : the @xmath68 mode is not practically generated , while the signal @xmath67 pulse is split into two temporal modes @xcite .",
    "this is because the short pulses are hardly overlapped in a dense medium and emerge very fast the interaction region due to the difference in their group velocities ."
