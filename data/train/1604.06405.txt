    "<S> recent progress in manipulating atomic and condensed matter systems has instigated a surge of interest in non - equilibrium physics , including many - body dynamics of trapped ultracold atoms and ions , near - field radiative heat transfer , and quantum friction . </S>",
    "<S> under most circumstances the complexity of such non - equilibrium systems requires a number of approximations to make theoretical descriptions tractable . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is often assumed that spatially separated components of a system thermalize with their immediate surroundings , although the global state of the system is out of equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> this powerful assumption reduces the complexity of non - equilibrium systems to the local application of well - founded equilibrium concepts . </S>",
    "<S> while this technique appears to be consistent for the description of some phenomena , we show that it fails for quantum friction by underestimating by approximately @xmath0 the magnitude of the drag force . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the correlations among components of driven , but steady - state , quantum systems invalidate the assumption of local thermal equilibrium , calling for a critical reexamination of this approach for describing the physics of non - equilibrium systems .    in recent years </S>",

    "<S> better known for equilibrium phenomena such as the van der waals / casimir - polder force @xcite and the casimir effect @xcite , these interactions play an important role in several fields of physics , including atomic @xcite and statistical physics @xcite , gravitation @xcite and cosmology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> non - equilibrium physics enters in the description of these phenomena when , for example , temperature gradients or mechanical motion become relevant elements of the system .    from the theoretical standpoint </S>",
    "<S> , one must often rely on approximations in order to predict the non - equilibrium physics of a specific system . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most ubiquitous approaches relies on the local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) approximation , which consists in treating the individual components of a system as if they were in local thermal equilibrium with their immediate surroundings . </S>",
    "<S> the main advantage of such a technique is that common equilibrium tools , such as the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) @xcite , can be applied locally , and then these local results are combined to describe the non - equilibrium dynamics of the full system . </S>",
    "<S> the usual justification for the lte approximation is that the correlation length of the fields that mediate the interactions is often rather short ( the dynamics in sufficiently well - separated locations are incoherent and can be treated as being independent @xcite ) , and the sub - systems locally relax to equilibrium on a fast time - scale . </S>",
    "<S> the lte approximation has been used in several non - equilibrium contexts , such as near - field radiative heat transfer @xcite , casimir forces between bodies at different temperatures @xcite , and quantum friction @xcite . in these previous cases , however , a quantitative assessment of the lte approximation is missing . in this work , </S>",

    "<S> for small velocities the friction is well described by the asymptotic expression equation ( black dotted line ) . in this region the integrals in equation are dominated by the low frequency behavior of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , resulting in the power - law dependency on velocity and separation ( see supplemental material ) . </S>",

    "<S> we demonstrated this point with an exact solution to a model of a harmonic oscillator moving parallel to a surface , in which the lte approach underestimates the quantum friction force by approximately @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> motion - induced atom - surface correlations are ultimately responsible to the breakdown of the local equilibrium assumption . </S>",
