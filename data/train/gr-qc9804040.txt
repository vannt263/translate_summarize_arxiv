    "the gravitational collapse of a localized concentration of matter to a black hole is a central theme in general relativity . even in the simplest case of spherically symmetric collapse",
    "much remains to be learned .",
    "when no matter is present , i.e. in the case of the vacuum einstein equations , there is no collapse in spherical symmetry , because of birkhoff s theorem .",
    "thus it is necessary , in order to obtain information about gravitational collapse by studying the spherically symmetric case , to choose a matter model .",
    "a simple choice , which has provided valuable insights , is that of a massless ( real , minimally coupled ) scalar field . a deep mathematical investigation of spherically symmetric solutions of the einstein - scalar field system has been carried out by christodoulou .",
    "some of his results will now be discussed .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that for sufficiently small initial data the fields disperse to infinity at large times . a result for the case of large data",
    "was proved in @xcite . for any solution it is possible to define a number @xmath0 with the property that in the region @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the area radius ) the solution approaches the schwarzschild solution of mass @xmath0 at large times .",
    "the physical interpretation is that the system has collapsed to form a black hole of mass @xmath0 . of course @xmath3 in the case that the field disperses .",
    "the dichotomy between dispersion and black hole formation still leaves the question unanswered , which data result in which of these two outcomes , except for small data . in @xcite christodoulou",
    "gave a sufficient condition on initial data to ensure that @xmath4 for the corresponding solution , although this criterion is not very practical .    for large data",
    "the above results only describe the structure of the solution at sufficiently large radius and the internal structure is left open . in @xcite",
    "it was proved that there exist data leading to the formation of a naked singularity .",
    "the negative implications of this for the cosmic censorship hypothesis are limited by the fact @xcite that this behaviour is unstable in the class of spherically symmetric initial data .",
    "an important new element was brought into the study of the einstein - scalar field and gravitational collapse in general by the numerical work of choptuik @xcite .",
    "he took a fixed initial datum for the scalar field ( which due to spherical symmetry determines initial values for the gravitational field ) and scaled it by an arbitrary constant factor .",
    "this gives rise to a family of initial data depending on a real parameter @xmath5 .",
    "for all initial data used in the computations the same picture emerged . for values of @xmath5 corresponding to small data the field dispersed , in agreement with the rigorous results . for large initial data",
    "a black hole was formed . under these circumstances",
    "we can define a critical parameter @xmath6 as the lower limit of those values of @xmath5 for which a black hole is formed .",
    "if the mass @xmath0 of the black hole formed is plotted as a function of @xmath5 it is found that @xmath7 is continuous . in particular",
    "@xmath8 so that black holes of arbitrarily small mass can be formed within the given one - parameter family . up to",
    "now it has not been possible to confirm this behaviour by rigorous mathematical arguments .",
    "choptuik s results contain much more detailed statements than the one just mentioned , but it is the one which will be important in the sequel .",
    "the nature of the boundary between dispersion and black hole formation in gravitational collapse is now a very active research area .",
    "most ( but not all ) of the work has been concerned with spherical symmetry and varying matter models and has relied essentially on numerical computations . for a recent review of the field see @xcite . in a study of critical collapse for the einstein - yang - mills equations , choptuik , chmaj and bizo",
    "@xcite have found both cases where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "they call these cases type ii and type i respectively , the terminology being motivated by an analogy to phase transitions in statistical mechanics .",
    "they relate type i behaviour in this system to the existence of the bartnik - mckinnon solutions @xcite , which are static .",
    "( the models which had been considered previously , and which showed exclusively type ii behaviour , admit no regular static solutions . )",
    "almost all the matter models which have been considered up to now in the context of critical collapse are field theoretic in nature rather than phenomenological .",
    "the one exception is a perfect fluid with linear equation of state , which shows type ii behaviour .",
    "a phenomenological matter model whose collapse is of interest is collisionless matter described by the vlasov equation .",
    "as will be described next , the spherical collapse of collisionless matter has been studied both analytically and numerically but the known results for this type of matter say little about the nature of critical collapse .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to begin the numerical investigation of critical collapse of collisionless matter .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that for sufficiently small initial data for collisionless matter the matter disperses to infinity at large times .",
    "thus the analogue of christodoulou s small data result holds for collisionless matter .",
    "the solutions are geodesically complete .",
    "unfortunately , no analogue of his large data result is known is this case .",
    "the only result in that direction which has been proved is that there do exist initial data which develop singularities @xcite .",
    "the proof proceeds by demonstrating the existence of initial data which contain trapped surfaces and applying the penrose singularity theorem .",
    "a different kind of large data result , which is relevant to the numerical calculations of this paper , is that if data given on a hypersurface of constant schwarzschild time gives rise to a solution which develops a singularity after a finite amount of schwarzschild time , then the first singularity occurs at the centre of symmetry @xcite .",
    "an analogous result where schwarzschild time is replaced by maximal slicing has also been proved @xcite .",
    "it seems plausible that in those solutions which develop singularities black holes are usually formed .",
    "however there are no mathematical results on this and the convincing evidence for the formation of black holes is purely numerical .",
    "this is part of a large body of work due to shapiro , teukolsky and collaborators which goes far beyond the spherically symmetric case . here",
    "only those results will be discussed which are directly relevant to this paper .",
    "in particular only results for spherical symmetry are covered .",
    "in @xcite the collapse of various configurations of collisionless matter to a black hole has been computed numerically .",
    "the relative merits for this problem of different choices of time coordinate ( polar or maximal ) and radial coordinate ( area or isotropic ) are discussed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we carry out an experiment analogous to that of choptuik for spherically symmetric collapse of collisionless matter .",
    "we use schwarzschild coordinates ( i.e. polar slicing and area radius ) . starting with a suitable smooth function @xmath10 of compact support as initial datum for the distribution function we consider the scaled data @xmath11 , where @xmath5 is a positive constant and",
    "compute the corresponding time evolution numerically .",
    "for all data for which we tried the experiment , the results were qualitatively similar .",
    "when @xmath5 is sufficiently small the matter disperses , in agreement with the analytic theory .",
    "this happens up to some value @xmath12 of @xmath5 . for @xmath13",
    "the observed behaviour indicates the formation of a black hole .",
    "the lapse function develops an abrupt step at a certain radius @xmath14 .",
    "this step remains at the same radius but gets deeper and deeper .",
    "we interpret this as the signature of a black hole with mass @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath7 is plotted as a function of @xmath5 it is found that the limiting value of @xmath7 as @xmath5 approaches @xmath12 from above is strictly positive .",
    "thus we find behaviour of type i in the terminology of @xcite .",
    "we never find any signs of singularity formation for any value of @xmath5 and this is consistent with the standard picture where the only singularities formed are those of black hole type and they are avoided by a schwarzschild time coordinate .    as a check on the interpretation of the numerical solutions as describing collapse to a black hole ,",
    "radial null geodesics were computed .",
    "the results agreed well with the expected picture .",
    "radial null geodesics starting at the centre at early times escape to large values of @xmath2 .",
    "those starting after a certain time @xmath16 remain within a finite radius .",
    "the limit of this radius as @xmath17 tends to @xmath16 from above is equal to @xmath14 as computed above .",
    "thus we obtain a consistent picture with a black hole whose event horizon is generated by the null geodesics starting at the centre at time @xmath16 .    to have a better picture of what is happening in the collapse of near critical initial data it is useful to consider how the mass @xmath7 of the black hole formed depends on the adm mass of the initial configuration .",
    "for parameter values @xmath5 well above",
    "@xmath12 these quantities are almost equal .",
    "in other words , essentially all the matter falls into the black hole .",
    "as the critical parameter value is approached from above some of the matter does not fall into the black hole and in some of the cases which were computed escapes to infinity .",
    "however , in all the cases which were computed the mass of the black hole is more than 90% of the total adm mass of the configuration .",
    "thus whenever a black hole is formed almost all the matter falls into it and the mass gap is a reflection of this .",
    "the picture in the only other case of a phenomenological matter model in which critical collapse has been studied up to now , namely a perfect fluid with linear equation of state , is very different . in the case of a radiation fluid ( equation of state @xmath18 )",
    "the slightly supercritical collapse can be described as follows @xcite .",
    "the matter divides almost completely into two parts , separated by a near vacuum region . the outer part of the matter , which contains almost all the mass , escapes to infinity . the inner part , which contains only a very small amount of mass , collapses to form a ( small ) black hole . as the critical parameter",
    "is approached this situation becomes more and more extreme and the black hole mass tends to zero .",
    "the numerical code used is based on a numerical scheme for the corresponding newtonian problem described in @xcite .",
    "it incorporates less refined features than the codes of shapiro and teukolsky but seems to be quite sufficient for the present task .",
    "it does have the advantage that an analogous newtonian code has been proved to be convergent @xcite and it seems reasonable to hope that this proof could be extended so as to obtain results on the convergence of the method used in this paper in the future .",
    "these results add collisionless matter to the class of matter models for which something is known about critical collapse .",
    "clearly it is desirable to examine other types of initial data so as to discover the prevalence of the type of behaviour found here or of others which have not yet been seen .",
    "it is our hope that these numerical investigations can also help to further the mathematical study of collisionless matter in general relativity by providing pictures of what is happening which can suggest which theorems one should try to prove and by what means .",
    "mathematical investigations of partial differential equations often proceed by estimating the growth rates of certain quantities and it is useful to have an idea of the expected growth rates on the basis of numerical computations . the fact that we observe no singularities in the numerical computations can be seen as evidence that the weak cosmic censorship conjecture is true for collisionless matter . indeed it may even be true in a stronger version than in the case of the massless scalar field",
    ". there may be no naked singularities formed for any regular initial data rather than just for generic initial data .",
    "this speculation is based on the fact that the naked singularities which occur in scalar field collapse appear to be associated with the existence of type ii critical collapse .",
    "the paper proceeds as follows : in the next section we formulate the vlasov - einstein system , first in general coordinates , and then in coordinates adapted to the spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat situation that we want to study . in section 3 we describe the code we are using and test it on a steady state . in section 4 we present the results of the numerical simulations .",
    "in the present paper the matter model is a collisionless gas as described by the vlasov or liouville equation . coupling this equation self - consistently to the einstein field equations results in the vlasov - einstein system , which we first write down in general",
    "coordinates on the tangent bundle @xmath19 of the spacetime manifold @xmath0 : @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the number density of the particles on phase - space , @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the christoffel symbols and the einstein tensor obtained from the spacetime metric @xmath26 , @xmath27 denotes its determinant , @xmath28 is the energy - momentum tensor generated by @xmath23 , @xmath29 are coordinates on @xmath0 , @xmath30 the corresponding coordinates on the tangent bundle @xmath19 , greek indices run from 0 to 3 , and @xmath31 is the rest mass of a particle at the corresponding phase - space point .",
    "we assume that all particles have rest mass 1 and move forward in time so that the distribution function @xmath23 lives on the mass shell @xmath32 we consider this system in the asymptotically flat and spherically symmetric case and use schwarzschild coordinates to coordinatize the spacetime manifold .",
    "the metric takes the form @xmath33 where @xmath34,\\ \\phi \\in [ 0,2\\pi]$ ] .",
    "asymptotic flatness is then expressed as the boundary condition @xmath35 we also require a regular centre , which is guaranteed by the boundary condition @xmath36 to write the vlasov equation we use the corresponding cartesian coordinates @xmath37 as spatial and @xmath38 as momentum coordinates .",

    "the field equations remain unaffected , and the source terms ( [ r ] ) , ( [ p ] ) , ( [ j ] ) can be rewritten in terms of @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "we now mention some results that have been established for the spherically symmetric vlasov - einstein system . throughout",

    "this resulted in 2550 particles ( less than @xmath117 since the support of @xmath23 is not rectangular ) . at time zero the maximal errors in @xmath76 and @xmath80 ( maximum over @xmath2 ) were @xmath118 and @xmath119 respectively .",

    "a run was made with @xmath160 particles , @xmath161 , and final time @xmath138 .",
    "the resulting graphs of @xmath76 and @xmath80 with the finer resolution are qualitatively very similar to figures 3 and 4 , except that the transitions are slightly more abrupt and the maximal value of @xmath144 is increased by about @xmath162 .",

    "for @xmath163 a similar structure formed with a stationary abrupt transition in @xmath80 , but a small amount of mass escaped .",

    "for @xmath165 the radius of the maximum of @xmath83 and the radius of the abrupt transition in @xmath80 are nearly the same .",
    "thus we have computed the radius @xmath14 where the maximal value ( over @xmath2 and @xmath17 ) of @xmath166 occurred .",
    "so this is the value of @xmath2 where the condition ( [ nots ] ) is most nearly violated . for @xmath165 the maximum @xmath83",
    "was attained at the largest time , for @xmath167 it was attained earlier .",
    "the results are graphed in figure 5 .",
    "since the adm mass of the configuration depends linearly on @xmath5 and for @xmath168 nearly all the mass is captured in the black hole , the mass of the black hole , @xmath15 , depends nearly linearly on @xmath5 for @xmath168 .",
    "the values for @xmath169 are plotted as a dotted curve .",
    "we note that @xmath170 which indicates type i behaviour as explained in the introduction .",

    "similar to figure 5 , figure 6 shows the radius where the maximal value of @xmath83 occurs as a function of @xmath5 . for @xmath176",
    "the maximum was attained at the largest time . for this initial condition",
    "a smaller time step of @xmath177 was used .",
    "similarly we consider @xmath178 for @xmath179 and @xmath174 and @xmath180 otherwise .",
    "figure 7 plots radius versus @xmath5 as figures 5 and 6 did .",
    "for @xmath181 the maximum of @xmath83 occurred at the largest time . for @xmath182",
    "the maximum occurred at times near zero , hence the nearly constant values of @xmath2 for @xmath182 .    in figures 5 , 6 and 7 the final time",
    "was taken large enough that increasing it produced only minor changes .",
