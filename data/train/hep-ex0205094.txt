    "charm production in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) at hera has been shown in previous studies to be consistent with purely dynamic boson - gluon fusion ( bgf ) production @xcite .",
    "this agreement has now been tested with a larger data sample than the previous zeus measurements , and @xmath2 as well as @xmath1 cross sections have been calculated .",
    "the charmed mesons were identified using the decay @xmath5 with @xmath8 and corresponding antiparticle processes , where @xmath9 refers to a low momentum pion accompanying the @xmath10 .",
    "the differential cross sections are measured as functions of @xmath11 and bjorken @xmath12 , defined as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the four - momenta of the initial and final state lepton , and p is the four - momentum of the proton .",
    "the zeus detector is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath11 variables were reconstructed by the @xmath17-method , which uses both the scattered lepton and the hadronic system measurements @xcite .",

    "the @xmath33 distributions are shown in figure 1 , for @xmath2 and @xmath1 data separately .",

    "figure 2 shows the differential cross sections as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath12 compared to the nlo calculation implemented in the hvqdis program @xcite .",
    "this program is based on the bgf mechanism , and uses the peterson fragmentation function @xcite , with @xmath45 = 0.035 , to hadronise the charm quark to a @xmath23 .",

    "the hadronisation fraction @xmath47 was set to 0.235 @xcite .",
