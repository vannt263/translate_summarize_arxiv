    "diffusion in random media is an an issue of great practical and theoretical importance which has a received a lot of attention in the past years @xcite .",
    "the presence of disorder , e.g. impurities or random site energies , lattice defects , ... may induce the localization of eigenstates and therefore have dramatic consequences on transport properties @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the localization transition , based on scaling theory for finite - dimensional systems @xcite has also greatly benefited from the study of models on tree - like architecture @xcite , that is without any underlying geometry .",
    "diffusion on such amorphous structures has also attracted attention as a toy - model of dynamical evolution in the phase space of complex , e.g. glassy systems @xcite .",
    "recently , it was pointed out that mixed lattices , built from a mixture of finite - dimensional structures and random graphs could be of interest to modelize various real situations taking place in different scientific fields @xcite . as a main attractive feature",
    ", these `` small - world '' models simultaneously combine short- and long - range interactions and could display some new and interesting properties stemming from this unusual coexistence @xcite .    from a physical point of view",
    ", this situation is already encountered in the field of polymers or more generally long molecules @xcite .",
    "couplings between successive monomers give rise to a unidimensional system while ( e.g. hydrodynamics ) interactions between constituents in the three - dimensional space are of long range nature along the polymeric chain .",
    "of course , the long - range links formed this way are strongly correlated and can not be considered to be independent as in the small - world paradigm .",
    "some successfull approximation schemes developed in the context of polymer theory , e.g. the self - consistent potential of edwards @xcite method precisely amount to neglect such correlations and nevertheless obtain reliable results @xcite . following zimm s work @xcite , many studies have concentrated on the influence of such interactions on the relaxation dynamics of polymers @xcite .",
    "however , these calculations can in a sense be considered as _ annealed _ since the hydrodynamical interactions tensor is averaged over chain positions _ before _ normal modes are computed and not _ later _ as it should .",
    "such a pre - averaging approximation @xcite may lead to qualitatively erroneous predictions especially for large eigenvalues and must be considered with caution .",
    "diffusion on the small - world lattice can therefore be viewed as an elementary step toward the understanding of small times vibrations or equivalently the instantaneous normal modes @xcite of a polymeric chain around a _",
    "quenched _ configuration .    from a theoretical point of view , the small - world structure is also worth being investigated since it mixes two structures which can be studied in great mathematical details @xcite .",
    "diffusion on a one - dimensional lattice obsviously reduces to the study of dispersion relations for plane waves @xcite .",
    "as for the random graph structure , a large attention has also been paid to its spectral properties @xcite . the main physical feature is the emergence of localized states centered on the geometrical defects of the graph , that is sites with abnormally low or large connectivities with respect to the average coordination number @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , the combination of both structures can be precisely studied and allows to answer some interesting questions concerning localization and the existence of pseudo - dispersion relations for the eigenmodes in presence of disorder @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section ii , the small - world model is defined and related to its building bricks , that is a random graph superposed to a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "the main features of diffusion on the latters are briefly recalled and used to guess some spectral properties of the small - world laplacian .",
    "section iii exposes the numerical results obtained from exact diagonalizations .",
    "the density of states as well as some characteritics of the eigenmodes , e.g. localization properties and autocorrelation functions are analyzed .",
    "we present in section iv the analytical approach to attack the problem , based on a self - consistent transfer matrix formalism @xcite .",
    "the region of the spectrum corresponding to extended eigenstates is studied in section v by means of an effective medium approximation @xcite .",
    "localization properties are unravelled in section vi using a more refined scheme of approximation exploiting the geometrical defect mechanism exposed above @xcite .",
    "we consider @xmath0 points @xmath1 , @xmath2 on a one - dimensional ring @xmath3 .",
    "each point @xmath1 is connected to its @xmath4 nearest neighbors @xmath5 ( where site labels are defined modulo @xmath0 to ensure periodicity on @xmath3 ) .",
    "in addition , we superpose to @xmath3 a random graph @xmath6 with mean connectivity @xmath7 defined as follows . each pair of points @xmath8 ( such that the distance @xmath9 on the ring is larger than @xmath10 ) is connected with probability @xmath11 and left unchanged with probability @xmath12 .    the small - world lattice @xmath13 is the union of both graphs @xmath14 and @xmath6 . in average , @xmath13 includes @xmath15 edges to largest order in @xmath0 .",
    "the coordination degree @xmath16 of @xmath1 is a random variable bounded from below by @xmath17 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath18 obeys a poisson law of parameter @xmath7 .",
    "this `` small - world '' lattice differs from the definition of @xcite but maintains the coexistence between short- and long - range links .",
    "in addition it leads to simpler analytical calculations than the model exposed in @xcite .",
    "we then consider the laplacian operator @xmath19 on @xmath20 . for @xmath21 , @xmath22",
    "if @xmath1 and @xmath23 are connected , 0 otherwise .",
    "diagonal elements , @xmath24 ensure the conservation of probability .",
    "note that , with respect to the usual definition , eigenvalues are rescaled by a multiplicative factor @xmath25 so that the support of the spectrum becomes positive .",
    "we call @xmath26 ( respectively @xmath27 ) the eigenvalues ( respectively the components of the associated eigenvectors normalized to unity ) of the laplacian @xmath28 , with @xmath29",
    ". most spectral properties of @xmath30 can be obtained through the calculation of the resolvent @xcite @xmath31 the mean density of eigenvalues indeed reads @xmath32 where the overbar denotes the average over disorder , that is the random graph @xmath6 .",

    "localization properties of eigenmodes can be studied through the knowledge of inverse participation ratios @xcite .",
    "the inverse participation ratios of eigenmodes @xmath34 , defined as @xmath43 to give @xmath44 following the procedure described above .",
    "though inverse participation ratios may fluctuate from state to state at a given eigenvalue @xmath45 , a non vanishing value of the ensemble averaged @xmath46 gives a good indication of the emergence of localization @xcite .",
    "the spectral properties of @xmath13 will of course reflect its mixed structure . before turning to numerics , it is therefore useful to briefly recall known results on the spectral properties of both @xmath14 and @xmath6 separately .      on the ring ,",

    "the eigenvalue @xmath45 is stationary for four different wave numbers @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 corresponding to @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "according to fig  1a , @xmath76 will exhibit one ( respectively two or three ) dirac peaks over the range @xmath77 when @xmath78 ( respectively @xmath79 or @xmath80 ) .",
    "the locations of the peaks coincide with the multivalued function @xmath81 , giving back the relation of dispersion ( [ disperpur ] ) .",
    "the study of the power spectrum will turn out to be useful for establishing pseudo - dispersion relations on the small - world lattice in presence of disorder .",
    "diffusion on the random graph has been the object of several analytical and/or numerical studies @xcite .",
    "briefly speaking , the two main physical features are  :    * the spectral density has a bell - like shape with small oscillating tails ( see fig  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "the central bell - like part corresponds to extended states . *",
    "the lateral oscillations are accompanied by increase of the inverse participation ratio , which is an indication of the localization of eigenmodes near mobility edges .",
    "localized states are centered on geometrical defects , that is sites with abnormally large or low connectivities with respect to the average coordination number .",
    "more quantitatively , defects will pin localized states if their connectivity @xmath82 deviate from the average coordination number @xmath7 by more than @xmath83 .",
    "due to the defect mechanism , the localized peak associated to connectivity @xmath82 has a total weight ( i.e. integrated density of states ) well approximated by the poisson law @xmath84 .",
    "we start by decomposing @xmath30 into @xmath85 .",
    "one is tempted to treat @xmath86 as a small perturbation with respect to the ring laplacian @xmath87 when @xmath88 .",
    "the resolvents @xmath89 and @xmath90 for the small - world lattice and the ring obey the dyson equation @xmath91 using the above equation , the fourier transform of the self - energy @xmath92 at energy @xmath45 and momentum @xmath51 can be computed order by order within perturbation theory @xcite .    at first order , the self - energy reads using ( [ wave1 ] ) , @xmath93 for non zero phases @xmath51 . in other terms , the whole spectrum on fig  1b would be shifted to the right by @xmath94 .",
    "second order corrections to the self - energy may be written as @xmath95 where the subscript @xmath82 indicates the connected two - points correlation function of @xmath86 .",
    "the emergence of an imaginary part in the self - energy shows that the resolvent @xmath96 at energy level @xmath45 will decrease exponentially with the distance @xmath97 over a typical length @xmath98 the latter may be interpreted as the elastic mean path @xcite travelled by a wave at energy level @xmath45 between two successive scattering events . in other words ,",
    "the peaks appearing in the power spectrum of the eigenvectors ( [ beso ] ) will acquire some finite width @xmath99 , see section iv.d .",
    "@xmath100 indeed diverges for weak disorder @xmath101 .",
    "clearly , perturbation theory is sensible as long as the wave length @xmath102 keeps much smaller than the elastic mean path @xmath103 , the so - called ioffe - regel criterion @xcite .",
    "this condition obviously breaks down at van hove singularities , see section ii.c .",
    "furthermore , at moderately large eigenvalues ( @xmath104 in the @xmath60 case ) , the existence of several distinct branches in the dispersion relation ( fig  1a ) makes the density of states higher than at smaller eigenvalues ( @xmath105 ) as seen fig  1b .",
    "we therefore expect from expression ( [ le ] ) that disorder will affect the density of states at large eigenvalues more strongly than at small energy levels .",
    "this reasoning should hold except at vanishing eigenvalues @xmath45 .",
    "one - dimensional model indeed present the peculiarity that the density of states diverges at zero energy .",
    "more precisely , @xmath106 as @xmath107 and therefore perturbation theory should not be trust below @xmath108 .    what happens at smaller energy levels ?",
    "some heuristic arguments were developed in @xcite to answer this equation in the random graph case .",
    "first of all , calculations of the spectrum on a cayley tree with _ fixed _ connectivity @xmath82 show a gap between the null eigenvalue and the left side of the spectrum support which disappear in the limit @xmath109 only . indeed , long enough chain - like structure are capable of exhibiting small eigenvalues of the order of their inverse squared length @xcite .",
    "it is appealing but speculative to think that the small eigenvalues of @xmath30 come from rare portions of the 1-d ring unaltered by disorder @xcite .",
    "this lifshitz - like argument may be quantified as follows .",
    "a chain of @xmath110 sites , giving rise to eigenvalues of the order of @xmath111 will not be corrupted by the random graph component @xmath6 with an exponentially small probability scaling as @xmath112 . summing these contributions to the density of states over large @xmath110 values",
    ", we obtain @xmath113 for small @xmath45 s . expression ( [ br ] ) has a nice interpretation in terms of the disordered - induced length @xmath114 .",
    "the eigenmodes of the ring are exponentially attenuated with the ratio of their wave - length over the typical distance @xmath115 between two successive random links incoming onto the one - dimensional structure .",
    "when @xmath107 , the exponential term in ( [ br ] ) vanishes as @xmath116 ( where @xmath117 is a constant ) and thus screens the algebric divergence of @xmath118 .",
    "this argument predicts a cross - over between the pure case and the lifshitz tail at @xmath119 corresponding to a density @xmath120 .",
    "we shall see in next sections that such a cross - over is indeed present .",
    "in this section we restrict to @xmath60 . the corresponding ring has a non trivial relation of dispersion giving rise to richer features than for smaller values of the connectivity , e.g. @xmath121 .",
    "in addition , diagonalizations of small - world lattices with larger @xmath10 suffer from bigger finite - size effects and thus reliable results demand a prohibitive computing cost .",
    "we have performed exact numerical diagonalizations of the random laplacian @xmath30 in the case @xmath60 for different sizes , up to @xmath122 and for 1000 samples .",
    "fig  2a and fig  2b respectively display @xmath123 and @xmath44 for connectivity parameters @xmath124 .",
    "main remarks are in order  :    * the density of states at small eigenvalues seems to vanish for @xmath125 .",
    "there is no true gap strictly speaking but rather a very small density of states ( discussed in section ii.e ) that can not be accounted for by numerics due to the statistical shortfall of eigenvalues . in the following , the @xmath126 $ ] range",
    "will be referred to as a `` pseudo - gap '' . *",
    "the density of states exhibit a maximum on the left side of the spectrum at @xmath127 , slightly above @xmath128 . *",
    "the central part of the spectrum ( @xmath129 ) has a smooth shape and corresponds to extended states .",
    "the general form of @xmath130 is reminiscent of the density of states for the ring fig  1b but divergences have been smeared out by disorder @xcite .",
    "notice that in the range @xmath131 , the density of states is in quantitative agreement with the ring spectrum , compare fig  1b and fig  2a .",
    "for increasing sizes @xmath0 and at fixed @xmath45 , @xmath132 vanishes as @xmath52 and the breakdown of this scaling identifies the upper mobility edge  : @xmath133 . * on the right side of the spectrum , the density exhibits successive regular peaks and the eigenstates become localized , see fig  2b .",
    "similar results are shown fig  3a - b for @xmath60 and a larger random graph component @xmath134 . in this case , we have found @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 . as expected , localization effects are stronger and the pseudo - gap becomes wider .",
    "following section ii.b , we have computed the power spectra @xmath138 for different values of @xmath139 and connectivity parameters @xmath124 and @xmath140 , see fig  4 and fig  5 respectively .",
    "depending on the eigenvalue @xmath45 , the power spectrum is mainly composed of different peaks whose number varies from two to six as in the ring case , see fig  1a .",
    "however , these peaks have now non - zero widths , equal to the inverse autocorrelation lengths of the eigenvectors . a good fit on the range",

    "close to the pseudo - gap edge @xmath145 , @xmath146 equals two and the weight @xmath147 of the secondary peak gets much smaller than @xmath148 , see fig  4a and fig  5a . as a result , the estimates for @xmath149 becomes less accurate .",
    "moreover , for large eigenvalues , the lorentzian form ( [ lorfit ] ) does not fit numerical data two well .",
    "consequently , the error bars on @xmath150 increase when @xmath45 reaches @xmath151 .",
    "we have plotted fig  6 and fig  7 the wave numbers @xmath152 and the widths @xmath153 obtained from the numerical data vs. the eigenvalue @xmath45 for @xmath154 and @xmath134 respectively .    at first sight ,",
    "the wave numbers @xmath155 are much less affected by disorder than the overall features of the density of states , e.g the edges @xmath156 and @xmath151 and of course the inverse lengths @xmath153 ( that are equal to zero in the ring case ) .",
    "indeed , the stationary points in the wave numbers curves fig  6a and fig  7a , that is the merging points between @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath158 , @xmath159 precisely coincide with the ring values @xmath160 and @xmath161 of section ii.c . the main qualitative difference between the above figures and fig  1a lies in the appearance of a narrow area surrounded by the @xmath162 and @xmath163 lines , centered around @xmath161 and extending down to @xmath164",
    "thus , contrary to the ring case , the power spectrum of these eigenstates displays more than one peak ( even if the heights of the secondary peaks are small as mentioned above ) .",
    "when @xmath45 lies in the range @xmath165 , @xmath166 gets very small , see fig  6b and fig  7b . in presence of the disorder",
    ", these eigenmodes have conserved an overall quasi - plane wave form .",
    "such a behaviour is indeed expected from section ii.e .",
    "this result explains the quantitative agreement between the density of states of the ring and the numerical spectrum for the small - world lattice observed in section iii.a in the intermediate range @xmath167 .    to end with ,",
    "let us stress that formula ( [ lorfit ] ) allows us to define some pseudo relations of dispersion characterizing the gross form of eigenmodes at energy @xmath45 through some wave numbers @xmath168 and inverse autocorrelation lengths @xmath153 .",
    "following section ii.d , we have measured for each eigenvector @xmath169 the connectivity @xmath170 of its center , that is the site @xmath171 with maximum component @xmath172 @xcite .",
    "the mean connectivity @xmath173 of the centers of eigenvectors having eigenvalue @xmath45 is plotted fig .",
    "it is a smooth monotonous function of @xmath45 in the central part of the spectrum . in the localized region",
    ", @xmath173 is constant over a given peak and integer - valued ( for @xmath174 on the right side ) ; the center connectivity abruptly jumps when @xmath45 crosses the borders between peaks .",
    "table  i and ii list the weights @xmath175 of the localized peaks related to connectivities @xmath82 , that is the integrated densities of eigenvalues belonging to them .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath176 are also given .",
    "they are measured at the top of the peaks with absolute error @xmath177 whereas the relative error on @xmath175 is about @xmath178 .",
    "the reliability of numerical results suffers from two effects .",
    "first , as @xmath139 decreases , localized peaks get closer and closer to the flank of the extended spectrum and the determination of the top of the peaks @xmath176 becomes less and less accurate .",
    "secondly , for large eigenvalues , the corresponding statistical events are rare and fluctuate drastically from sample to sample leading to a poor accuracy on @xmath175 .",
    "note however that @xmath175 is of the same order of magnitude ( but smaller as it should be due to the screening effect exposed in @xcite ) as the fraction of sites having @xmath179 neighbors , with @xmath180 given by a poisson law of parameter @xmath7 .",
    "contrary to the random graph case @xcite , localized peaks are not found on the left side of the spectrum .",
    "indeed , the minimal connectivity of a site in the small - world case is @xmath181 and defects with low connectivities with respect to the average coordination @xmath182 can be seen at very strong disorder only .",
