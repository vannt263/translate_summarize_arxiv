    "but we note that @xmath83 so chosen may not necessary be a polynomial in @xmath8 .",
    "it follows from theorem [ t : chiang - yu ] that any subnormal solution @xmath19 given by ( [ e : chiang - yu - soln-1 ] ) has the form ( [ e : gundersen - steinbart - soln ] ) .",
    "thus our results ( [ e : chiang - yu - soln-1 ] ) and ( [ e : lommel - sol ] ) generalize the theorem a and give explicit formulae of the subnormal solutions of ( [ e : gundersen - steinbart - soln ] ) in this particular case .",
    "unlike the method used in @xcite which was based on nevanlinna s value distribution theory , our method is different , which is based on special functions , their asymptotic expansions , and the analytic continuation formulae for @xmath0 (  3.2 and  3.3 ) .",
    "a crucial step in our proof is to apply the lommel transformation (  2 ) to transform the equation ( [ e : chiang - yu ] ) into the equation    @xmath84    we recall from the basic differential equations theory that the general solution of ( [ e : generalized - lommel ] ) is the sum of _ complementary functions _ , which are the bessel functions , and a _",
    "particular integral _ where each of these particular integrals satisfies ( [ e : generalized - lommel ] ) . since",
    "a particular integral is generally not uniquely determined , so the novelty here is to apply standard asymptotic expansion theory ( see @xcite ) to each branch of @xmath1 in order to identify the ones that we need are precisely the particular integral whose modulus decrease to zero and degenerate when @xmath85 , except perhaps on the negative real axis of the @xmath8-plane .",
    "it turns out that these are precisely the classical lommel function @xmath0 .",
    "we then use the inverse lommel transformation to ( [ e : generalized - lommel ] ) and to recover the results for ( [ e : chiang - yu ] ) .",
    "the crux of the matter lies in the proof of theorem [ t : chiang - yu ] , which establishes the fact that the function @xmath86 is subnormal if and only if either @xmath87 or @xmath88 is equal to an odd positive integer .",
    "[ t : lommel ] let @xmath0 be a lommel function of an arbitrary branch .",
    "then the entire function @xmath33 is of finite order of growth if and only if either @xmath89 or @xmath88 is an odd positive integer @xmath90 for some non - negative integer @xmath42 . in particular , the entire function @xmath33 degenerates into the form ( [ e : special - lommel - sol ] ) with @xmath91 .",
    "thus , theorem [ t : chiang - yu ] characterizes the subnormal solutions found by gundersen and steinbart in @xcite to be those that correspond to the vanishing of the complementary functions and the reduction of particular integrals ( lommel s functions ) to polynomials in @xmath8 and @xmath16 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the lommel transformation in  2 , and show how to apply it to the equation ( [ e : chiang - yu ] ) to prove theorem [ t : chiang - yu](a ) . in  3 , the definitions of the lommel functions are given .",
    "in particular , we derive several new analytic continuation formulae for the lommel function @xmath0 in terms of the bessel functions of the third kind ( _ i.e. _ , hankel functions ) in the independent variable and also in terms of the _ chebyshev _ polynomials of the second kind @xmath92 but in the parameters . in  4 , by applying the asymptotic expansions of @xmath93 and @xmath0 , we can show that several entire functions are not subnormal .",
    "the crux of the matter in the proof of theorem [ t : chiang - yu ] that utilizes theorem [ t : lommel ] is to show that the function @xmath86 is subnormal if and only if either @xmath87 or @xmath88 must be an odd positive integer .",
    "although the @xmath86 is single - valued , the @xmath0 so defined is multi - valued in general .",
    "the nature of the problem forces us to consider our problem for the lommel functions for all branches .",
    "unfortunately , we have found that the literature on the analytic continuation of the lommel functions is inadequate , so that we have derived these new formulae in  3 .",
    "the details of the proof of theorem [ t : chiang - yu ] is also given in  4 . in  5 ,",
    "we prove theorem [ t : lommel ] and a consequence of it will be given . in ",
    "6 , we establish some analogues of now classical ` quantization - type ' theorems ( see e.g. @xcite , theorem 5.22 ) for non - homogeneous equations as a corollary to theorem [ t : chiang - yu ] . these theorems can be regarded as semi - classical quantitization - type results from quantum mechanics view - point .",
    "they are followed by corresponding examples .",
    "it is here that we identify the polynomials in ( [ e : gundersen - steinbart - soln ] ) correspond to a number of special polynomials : neumann s polynomials , gegenbauer s polynomials and schlfli s polynomials .",
    "the details of these polynomials and struve s functions are given in appendix [ adx : special ] .",
    "the analytic continuation formulae and asymptotic expansions of bessel functions are listed in appendix [ adx : bessel ] .",
    "lommel investigated transformations that involve bessel equations @xcite in 1868 .",
    "our standard references are @xcite ,  4.31 and @xcite , p. 13 .",
    "we mentioned that the same transformations were also considered independently by k. pearson ( see @xcite , p. 98 ) in 1880 .",
    "lommel considered the transformation    @xmath94    where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the new independent and dependent variables respectively , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we apply this transformation to equation ( [ e : generalized - lommel ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the function @xmath99 satisfies the equation    @xmath100u(x ) \\notag\\\\ & = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sigma_j \\alpha^{\\mu_j+1}\\beta^2 x^{\\beta(\\mu_j+1)-\\gamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which has @xmath101 as its general solution .",
    "following the idea in @xcite , we now apply a further change of variable by @xmath102 to ( [ e : reduced ] ) , then we have    @xmath103f \\notag\\\\ & = m^2\\sum_{j=1}^n \\sigma_j \\alpha^{\\mu_j+1}\\beta^2 { \\rm e}^{m[\\beta(\\mu_j+1)-\\gamma]z}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    choosing @xmath104 in ( [ e : general ] ) and then replacing @xmath105 and @xmath106 by @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively , yields ( [ e : chiang - yu ] ) .",
    "as we have noted in  1 that the general solution of ( [ e : lommel ] ) is given by a combination of the bessel functions of first and second kinds and the lommel function @xmath0 ( see @xcite ,  7.5.5 ) , hence the general solution to ( [ e : generalized - lommel ] ) is    @xmath109    then the general solution of the differential equation ( [ e : chiang - yu ] ) is therefore given by ( [ e : chiang - yu - soln-1 ] ) .",
    "this proves theorem [ t : chiang - yu](a ) .",
    "the major part of the proof of our main theorems consists of studying the growth of the composite function @xmath2 in the complex @xmath79-plane .",
    "however , the growth of @xmath2 as a subnormal solution must be _ independent of the different branches _ of @xmath110 , so one needs to consider its growth in all such branches .",
    "we first note that the lommel functions have a rather complicated definition with respect to different subscripts ( in four different cases ) even in the principal branch of @xmath8 .",
    "since we can not find such analytic continuation formulae for the lommel functions in the literature in general , and the formulae with respect to the different _ singular _ subscripts in particular ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath111 equals an odd negative integer ) , so we shall derive these new continuation formulae in this section .",
    "due to the complicated nature of the lommel functions with respect to different subscripts in the principal branch , so we make no apology to list some known properties in  [ sub : lommel-1 ] below before we derive new analytic continuation formulae in  [ sub : lommel-2 ] and  [ sub : lommel-3 ] . here",

    "otherwise the second and third arguments in the @xmath118 in ( [ e : small - lommel ] ) would be meaningless .",
    "this explains the restriction on @xmath119 given above ( see @xcite ,  10.7 ) .",
    "following watson , we define another particular solution @xmath0 for the equation ( [ e : lommel ] ) , which is also called a _",
    "lommel function_. it is related to the @xmath112 by the following formulae    @xmath120,\\label{e : lommel - lommel-1}\\\\     & : = s_{\\mu,\\,\\nu}(\\zeta)+ k \\bigg[j_{\\nu}(\\zeta)\\sin\\big(\\frac{\\mu-\\nu}{2}\\pi\\big )      -y_\\nu(\\zeta)\\cos\\big(\\frac{\\mu-\\nu}{2}\\pi\\big)\\bigg],\\label{e : lommel - lommel-2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath121    @xmath122 .",
    "the first definition ( [ e : lommel - lommel-1 ] ) holds in all cases of @xmath46 except when @xmath56 is an integer . the equivalent form ( [ e : lommel - lommel-2 ] ) holds even when @xmath56 is an integer .",
    "so we shall adopt the second form ( [ e : lommel - lommel-2 ] ) as the general definition for the function @xmath0 @xcite , p. 347 .",
    "this second lommel function @xmath0 so defined has the advantage that it is still meaningful even when either @xmath87 or @xmath88 is an odd negative integer ( see below ) , while @xmath112 remains undefined in ( [ e : lommel - lommel-2 ] ) for either of these parameter values . since our solution to the main theorems will involve the lommel functions valid for _ all complex subscripts _ , so we shall seek a way to define @xmath0 when either @xmath87 or @xmath88 is an odd negative integer .",
    "since one easily see from the formulae ( [ e : small - lommel ] ) , ( [ e : lommel - lommel-1 ] ) and ( [ e : k - constant ] ) that @xmath0 is an even function of @xmath56 , it would be sufficient to derive a formula for @xmath0 when @xmath88 is an odd negative integer and the way we define it is shown below .",
    "it is known that both the @xmath112 and @xmath0 satisfy the same recurrence relation @xcite ,  10.72 ( 1 ) and ( 6 ) :    @xmath123s_{\\mu,\\,\\nu}(\\zeta).\\ ] ]    in particular , when @xmath111 is an odd negative integer , then one may use this recurrence relation repeatedly to define @xmath0 . indeed letting @xmath124 and applying ( [ e : lommel - at - odd ] ) as in @xcite ,  10.73 ( 1 ) repeatedly yields    @xmath125    where @xmath42 is a positive integer .",

    "semi - explicit representations of special entire solutions for homogeneous second order linear periodic differential equations were obtained by complex analysts using tools from nevanlinna theory starting from the 1970s ( see for examples @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the main idea has an origin in the picard@xmath458borel exceptional value for entire functions and the theories develop quite independent from the classical approaches to hill s equations and mathieu equations ( @xcite ) .",
    "many of these equations are related to models in quantum mechanics ( @xcite ) and it is found that the determination of their ( discrete ) eigenvalues ( _ i.e. , _ their spectrum ) can be described by using exponent of convergence of the zeros of solutions , a quantity that is related to borel exceptional value in classical function theory ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , one of the authors and ismail identified an important class of orthogonal polynomials : generalized bessel polynomials appear in the representation of the special solutions to ( [ e : chiang - ismail-1 ] ) and ( [ e : chiang - ismail-2 ] ) in @xcite along with the determination of their eigenvalues .",
    "this paper extends , on the one hand , that one can use the lommel functions and related polynomials ( to bessel functions ) to describe the subnormal ( special ) solutions of ( [ e : chiang - yu - special ] ) first considered by gundersen and steinbart @xcite , and on the other hand , shows that a kind of semi - classical quantization for non - homogeneous equations also exists for ( [ e : chiang - yu - special ] ) , ( [ e : chiang - yu ] ) and the equations in the theorem [ t : quantizations ] .",
    "in addition , we obtain a number of new analytic continuation formulae for the lommel functions , and a new property for the lommel functions ( theorem [ t : lommel ] ) .",
    "although the lommel functions have numerous physical applications as mentioned in the introduction , to the best of the authors knowledge , only few papers have been written to investigate their mathematical properties in the past decades .",
    "see for examples @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and the references therein .",
    "although we generally do not have a simple quantum mechanical interpretation for non - homogeneous equations like the equation ( [ e : chiang - yu - special ] ) , its homogeneous counterpart and the lommel functions themselves have numerous applications in various branches of physical applications .",
    "so it is hoped the results in this paper will be of interest for others in due course .",
    "let @xmath169 be an integer .",
    "we record here the following analytic continuation formulae for the bessel functions @xcite ,  3.62 :    @xmath459    we recall the _ bessel functions of the third kind of order _",
    "@xmath56 @xcite ,  3.6 are given by    @xmath460    they are also called the _ hankel functions of order @xmath56 of the first and second kinds_.    the asymptotic expansions of @xmath193 and @xmath194 are also recorded as follows :    @xmath461\\ ] ]    where @xmath462 in @xmath463 ;    @xmath464\\ ] ]    where @xmath465 in @xmath466 .",
    "see @xcite ,  7.2 . as a result",
    ", we see that the asymptotic expansions ( [ e : hankel1-asy ] ) and ( [ e : hankel2-asy ] ) are valid _ simultaneously _ in the range @xmath301 .",
    "now we deduce from ( [ e : bessel - first - continuation ] ) and ( [ e : bessel - second - continuation ] ) the analytic continuation formulae for @xmath193 and @xmath194 @xcite ,  3.62 :    @xmath467    we note that the right hand sides of ( [ e : bessel - third-1-continuation ] ) and ( [ e : bessel - third-2-continuation ] ) are the principal branch of the hankel functions",
    ".    finally , we record the following derivative formulae for the hankel functions @xcite ,  3.6 :    @xmath468",
    "the neumann polynomials @xmath469 are defined as the coefficients in the expansion of @xmath470 in terms of bessel functions @xmath471 with @xmath472 , see @xcite , chap .",
    "ix and the connection between the lommel function @xmath0 and neumann s polynomials is given by @xcite ,  9.1 and  10.74 :                                where @xmath485 .",
    "the asymptotic expansions of the complementary functions @xmath486 and @xmath487 are considered in @xcite , chap .",
    "7 . it can be shown ( @xcite , chap .",
    "7 ) that there exists a particular integral @xmath488 so that its asymptotic expansion is given by      as @xmath490 in an unbounded region that depends on the coefficients @xmath491 and @xmath492 .",
    "we note that there is no claim that such a particular integral is unique .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the details .",
    "the lommel function @xmath112 given by ( [ e : small - lommel ] ) is a @xmath493 function .",
    "the @xmath0 defined by ( [ e : lommel - lommel-1 ] ) and ( [ e : lommel - lommel-2 ] ) matches the @xmath494 mentioned above , as clearly indicated by its asymptotic expansion in ( [ e : lommel - asymptotic - expansion ] ) .",
    "thus the lommel functions contribute to the subnormal solutions that concerns us in this paper .      if we take @xmath433 , we have @xmath495^{-1}$ ] and @xmath17 in equation ( [ e : generalized - lommel ] ) , then @xmath496 is the particular solution of it .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the struve function @xmath18 of order @xmath56 @xcite , pp .",
    "37 - 39 which is defined by                  by ( [ e : struve ] ) , the continuation formula for the struve function can be determined immediately .",
    "in fact , when @xmath501 for any non - negative integer @xmath61 , then it is noted easily from ( [ e : small - lommel - analytic - continuation ] ) and the first half of ( [ e : struve ] ) that @xmath502    where @xmath169 is any integer .",
    "when @xmath503 for a non - negative integer @xmath61 , then @xmath504 is an odd negative integer and so @xmath505 is undefined in this case but the second half of ( [ e : struve ] ) gives @xmath506 .",
    "then it follows from ( [ e : bessel - first - continuation ] ) that the analytic continuation formula ( [ e : struve - analytic - continuation - formula ] ) is also valid at @xmath503 .",
    "( we shall note that ( [ e : struve - analytic - continuation - formula ] ) was already given in @xcite ,  10.41 ( 5 ) . )",
    "it is shown @xcite , chap .",
    "7 that the function @xmath507 defined above is the _ unique _",
    "particular integral of the struve equation that satisfies ( [ e : slow - expansion ] ) .",
    "the expansion terminates if and only if @xmath56 is half of an odd positive integer .",
    "example [ ex : example - struve ] corresponds to this situation .",
    "so the general solution for the equation ( [ e : struve - eqn ] ) can be written in terms of bessel functions and @xmath507 .",
