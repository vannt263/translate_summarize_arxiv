    "absorbers towards the quasar sight lines have been systematically studied since @xcite ( for more recent studies , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "similar absorbers were subsequently seen in gamma - ray burst ( grb ) spectra .",
    "@xcite compared grb and quasar sight lines , and found a significantly higher incidence toward the former .",
    "they proposed three possible effects to explain this discrepancy : ( 1 ) faint quasars are obscured by dust associated with the absorbers ; ( 2 ) absorbers are intrinsic to grbs ; ( 3 ) gravitational lensing of the grb by the absorbers .",
    "however , they concluded that none of these effects provide a satisfactory explanation .",
    "@xcite proposed a simple geometric solution to the puzzle .",
    "they argued that if absorption systems are fragmented on scales @xmath3 , similar to the beam sizes of grbs , then the observed difference in incidence of absorbers would simply reflect the difference in the average beam sizes between grbs and quasars , with quasars being on average several times as big .",
    "this explanation predicts that absorption features due to intervening cloud fragments should evolve as the size of grb afterglow changes , which has now been observed by @xcite .",
    "however , structures of the absorbers down to the size of @xmath4 can not be directly inferred from their spectral features . @xcite",
    "put the strongest upper limits on absorber sizes to date .",
    "they observed the spectra of three images of q2237 + 0305 @xcite and found that each line of sight contained individual absorbers at approximately the same redshift , but with distinct spectral features .",
    "thus these absorbers are part of a complex that extends at least @xmath5 , but the sizes of the individual `` cloudlets '' must be smaller than @xmath6 based on the separation of the macro - images .",
    "some , if not all , strongly lensed quasars are also gravitationally microlensed by the compact stellar - mass objects in the lensing galaxy @xcite , and q2237 + 0305 was the first lensed quasar to be found to exhibit significant microlensing variability @xcite .",
    "the macro - image of a microlensed quasar is split into many micro - images , and when the source moves over the caustic networks induced by the microlenses , those micro - images will expand , shrink , appear , disappear and experience drastic astrometric shifts over timescales of months or years @xcite .",
    "the angular sizes of major micro - images are usually of the same order as those of the quasars , and during the shape and position changes of these images , absorption structures of similar scale along their sight lines will likely imprint significant variations on the spectrum .",
    "@xcite pioneered the theoretical investigation of quasar microlensing as a probe of the sub - parsec structure of intergalactic absorption systems .",
    "they concluded that variation in the strength of the absorption lines over timescales of years or decades caused by microlensing can be used to probe the structures of lyman @xmath7 clouds and associated metal - line absorption systems on scales @xmath8 .",
    "however , as i will show , they significantly underestimated the relevant timescales for spectral variability given the sizes of the systems they considered .",
    "thus , they substantially overestimated the scales of absorption structures that microlensing can effectively probe .    in the following section , i lay out the basic theoretical framework of the method .",
    "then in   [ sec : huchra ] , i present a numerical simulation of the microlensing of q2237 + 0305 .",
    "i show that micro - images of this quasar can be used to probe structures of and other metal - line absorption clouds on scales of @xmath9 by monitoring the spectral variations of absorption lines over months or years . finally in   [ sec : discussion ] , i summarize the results and discuss their implications .",
    "i begin with a brief summary of notation .",
    "subscripts `` @xmath10 '' , `` @xmath11 '' , `` @xmath12 '' and `` @xmath13 '' refer to the lens , source , observer and absorption cloud plane , respectively .",
    "the superscript `` @xmath14 '' is used to refer to the light ray on the cloud plane to distinguish it from the cloud . the angular diameter distance between object @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    "is denoted @xmath17 and is always positive regardless of which is closer ; in particular , @xmath18 refers to the angular diameter distance between the observer and object @xmath15 .",
    "the vector angular position of object @xmath15 is denoted @xmath19 , while its redshift is denoted @xmath20 .",
    "consider an absorbing cloud that is confronted with a `` bundle of light rays '' making their way from the source to the lens to the observer .",
    "let @xmath21 be the position vector of a point on the plane of the cloud .",
    "the line depth @xmath22 of an absorption line centered at wavelength @xmath23 is given by :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the surface density of the `` ray bundles '' on the plane of the absorption cloud with the rays weighted by the surface brightness profile of the quasar and @xmath26 is the absorption fraction at @xmath27 for light of wavelength @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the absorption cloud can be located either between the lens and observer or between the lens and source . in the former case ,",
    "the angular position of the light ray at the cloud plane is @xmath28 , so @xmath29 .",
    "the projected light rays on the cloud plane maintain the exact shapes of the quasar images , and their physical extents are proportional to the distance to the observer .",
    "if the cloud is between the lens and the source , it can be easily shown that @xmath30 is given by @xcite :    @xmath31    so @xmath32 the lens - source relative proper motion , with time as measured by the observer , is given ( in other notation ) by @xcite , @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the transverse velocities of the source , lens and observer , relative to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the unit vector in the direction of the lens and @xmath39 is the heliocentric cmb dipole velocity @xcite .    the formulae in this subject can be greatly simplified by proper choice of notation . to this end , i defined the `` absolute '' proper motion of an object @xmath15 moving at transverse velocity @xmath40 to be : @xmath41 i also define the `` reflex proper motion '' of an object @xmath15 relative to the observer - lens axis to be : @xmath42 then equation  ( [ eqn : veff ] ) can then be simplified , @xmath43 similarly , the lens - cloud relative proper motion is given by : @xmath44 note that the last term has a different sign depending on whether the cloud is farther or closer than the lens ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : reflex ] ) .",
    "equations  ( [ eqn : thetacloud ] ) , ( [ eqn : vls ] ) and ( [ eqn : vlc ] ) are the key formula needed to carry out the simulation in ",
    "[ sec : huchra ] . in this section ,",
    "i discuss the bulk motion and relevant timescales of the macro - image and its associated `` ray bundles '' on the cloud plane for the underlying case that the image is not perturbed by microlenses .",
    "when the source moves at @xmath45 , the angular positions of the rays that compose the images are also changing with respect to the observer - lens axis .",
    "if the macro - image is unperturbed by the microlenses , the relative proper motion @xmath46 is simply given by @xcite , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the magnification tensor .",
    "at the same time , the intersection of `` ray bundles '' with the cloud plane also change their angular positions relative to the lens . if the cloud plane is between the lens and the source , then from equation  ( [ eqn : thetacloud ] ) , the `` ray bundle''-lens relative proper motion @xmath49 is a linear combination of @xmath45 and @xmath46 weighted by distances , @xmath50 substituting equation  ( [ eqn : vli ] ) into equation  ( [ eqn : vlcray ] ) yields the bulk proper motion of the un - microlensed `` ray bundle '' relative to the lens , @xmath51   \\cdot \\vecmu_{ls}. \\label{eqn : vlcbulk}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the unit tensor .    when the `` ray bundles '' are between the source and the lens , their relative bulk proper motion is simply , @xmath53    there are two major effects that may induce variability of absorption lines toward a lensed quasar .",
    "one is the creation , destruction , distortion and astrometric shifts of micro - images , which probe structures similar to the size of the micro - images .",
    "the other is the bulk motion of the `` ray bundles '' relative to the cloud . on the cloud plane",
    ", this motion has an angular speed of @xmath54 , and the time @xmath55 required for the `` ray bundles '' to cross a cloud of transverse size @xmath56 is , @xmath57",
    "in october 1998 , @xcite obtained high - resolution keck spectra of images a , b and c of q2237 + 0305 .",
    "they found absorption lines at redshifts of @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the spectra of all three images , but absorption profiles of the individual sight lines differed ( e.g. , figs .",
    "6 and 10 of their paper ) .",
    "therefore , they concluded that the complexes giving rise to these absorption features must be larger than @xmath60 , while the individual components must be smaller than @xmath61 .",
    "q2237 + 0305 is also one of the most observed and studied lensed quasars with obvious microlensing features , and the properties of the system are well known .",
    "these factors make it an ideal object to investigate .",
    "the comprehensive statistical study of this lens by @xcite showed that the size of the quasar is @xmath62 .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the source size has a much more significant effect on microlensing models than the source brightness profile .",
    "for simplicity , in the simulation , i model the source as uniform disks with four different sizes : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "uniform grids of rays are traced from image plane to source plane @xcite . because structures of interest have similar sizes as the source , finite - source effects must be taken into account . the grid size used has an angular scale @xmath67 of the smallest source . @xcite",
    "demonstrated that a salpeter mass function can not be distinguished from a uniform mass distribution and found the mean stellar mass to be @xmath68 .",
    "for simplicity , i assign all stars in the simulation the same mass of @xmath69 .",
    "rays are shot from a region extending @xmath70 on each side , where @xmath71 is the einstein radius of a @xmath69 star .",
    "i adopt a convergence and shear for image a of @xmath72 from @xcite , and set the stellar surface density @xmath73 .",
    "four different trajectories , oriented at @xmath74 and @xmath75 degrees with respect to the direction of the shear are studied .",
    "positions on both the image plane and the source plane are recorded once a ray falls within a distance of @xmath76 times the largest source size from any trajectory on the source plane .",
    "a total length of @xmath77 along each trajectory is considered .    throughout the paper ,",
    "i adopt a @xmath78cdm cosmology with @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the lens and source are at redshifts @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "these imply @xmath84 .",
    "based on @xcite , i adopt transverse velocities of the lens , source and observer of @xmath85 .",
    "the lens and source absolute proper motions and the source reflex proper motion are @xmath86 . so the lens absolute proper motion dominates the lens - source relative proper motion . it can easily be shown that the absolute and reflex proper motions of the cloud are much smaller than the absolute proper motion of the lens unless the cloud redshift is close to or smaller than the lens redshift . for q2237 + 0305 , the lens redshift is very small compared to the source , so most likely @xmath87 .",
    "thus in following analysis , i focus on cloud with redshift @xmath88 , and ignore absolute and reflex proper motions of the source and the cloud . in this case , the source and the cloud share the same relative proper motion , @xmath89    in the simulation , as a practical matter , i hold the positions of the observer , lens galaxy ( as well as its microlensing star field ) fixed , and allow the source to move through the source plane at @xmath45 . then by equation  ( [ eqn : nopeculiar ] ) ,",
    "the cloud has the same relative proper motion as the source . at",
    "any given time , the angular positions of the `` ray bundles '' are calculated using equation  ( [ eqn : thetacloud ] ) . then by simply subtracting the angular position of the source at that time , the `` ray bundles '' positions are transformed to the reference frame of the cloud .    during short timescales , microlensing causes centroid shifts of the macro - image @xcite , with respect to the steady bulk motion of `` ray bundles '' relative to the cloud , which is described in ",
    "[ sec : bulk ] .",
    "if the direction of relative lens - source proper motion is the same as the lens shear , then by subtracting @xmath45 from equation  ( [ eqn : vlcbulk ] ) , one finds that the `` ray bundles '' have their maximum bulk proper motion relative to the cloud ,    @xmath90    if the source moves perpendicular relative to the lens shear ,",
    "@xmath91|1/(1-\\kappa+\\gamma ) -1| \\mu_{ls}$ ] , which is approximately 0 for the @xmath92 of image a.    figure  [ fig : lc ] and figure  [ fig : parallel ] show the results for a source trajectory that is parallel to the shear direction .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : lc ] shows the magnification pattern on the source plane , with a series of 4 concentric circles centered at 5 source positions ; and the top panels show the images at these positions relative to the source ( which has the same proper motion as the cloud ) .",
    "different colors represent different source sizes .",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ fig : lc ] shows the light curves for the 4 source sizes with the blue dash lines used to mark the times for the five source positions .",
    "figure  [ fig : parallel ] shows the `` ray bundles '' positions in the cloud frame at redshifts @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "the 5 different columns show the 5 positions corresponding to those in figure  [ fig : lc ] .    in the top row of figure",
    "[ fig : parallel ] , one can see that the `` ray bundles '' at @xmath97 , which is very close to the quasar , have almost exactly the same size and shape as the source and that the bundles show almost no bulk motion .",
    "the density of `` ray bundles '' clearly have the imprints from magnification pattern shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "so if an absorption cloudlet has a similar or somewhat smaller size than a source that is sitting directly behind it , the depth of its corresponding absorption line will change dramatically as the source crosses the caustics .",
    "the magnification close to a fold caustic is proportional to the inverse square root of the distance from it , so for a cloud with angular size @xmath98 , the fractional change in absorption line depth caused by the caustics scales as @xmath99 .",
    "hence , for cloud close to the quasar redshift , structures on scale @xmath100 ( depending on the source size ) will be probed over few - month to few - year timescales ( i.e. , the timescale of typical caustics crossings ) .",
    "the fourth row of panels of figure  [ fig : parallel ] shows `` ray bundles '' for @xmath101 , which is close to the lens redshift .",
    "a distinct difference between these `` ray bundles '' from the ones at @xmath97 is that they are split into many groups of bundles , which correspond to the micro - images in the top panel of figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "i dub these groups of `` ray bundles '' as micro - images in the following discussions .",
    "most of these micro - images are stretched one - dimensionally , and most rays are concentrated in a few _ major _ micro - images .",
    "the micro - images in different columns have drastically different morphologies and positions .",
    "if there are cloudlets of similar sizes as these micro - images distributed on the cloud plane , then the absorption spectra will show multi - component absorption features at any given time .",
    "these components will experience drastic changes in line depth , with some components disappearing and other new components appearing during the course of months or years , as the source crosses the microlensing caustics .",
    "another important characteristic is that the bulk of these micro - images are moving in the same direction as the source .",
    "this motion is described by equation  ( [ eqn : veffcloud2 ] ) , which yields @xmath102 .",
    "so from equation  ( [ eqn : tcc ] ) , structures as large as @xmath103 will be crossed in @xmath104 by the bulk motion of the `` ray bundles '' .",
    "hence , the effects caused by the micro - images and the bulk motion of the bundles together probe scales of @xmath100 on timescales of months to years .    the second and third row of panels in figure  [ fig : parallel ] refer to clouds at intermediate redshifts between the lens and the source .",
    "their redshifts , @xmath105 and @xmath106 , are close to the absorption systems observed by @xcite .",
    "as expected , the characteristics of these `` ray bundles '' are intermediate to those shown in rows 1 and 4 .",
    "the overall shapes of the micro - images are close to that of the source , with magnification patterns imprinted on them .",
    "and they also clearly show multiple components , which appear and disappear as the source crosses caustics .",
    "the angular sizes of the images are close to that of the ( unmagnified ) quasar .",
    "these micro - images could probe clouds with angular size from a factor of few smaller to a factor of few larger than the source size , which corresponds to scales of @xmath100 . from equation  ( [ eqn : tcc ] ) and ( [ eqn : veffcloud2 ] ) , the bulk motion of the bundles will probe cloud structures @xmath107 and @xmath108 during @xmath104 for @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively .    for a source trajectory that is perpendicular to the shear , there will be almost no bulk motion relative to the cloud for the `` ray bundles '' , while the magnitude of bulk motions for intermediate trajectories is a fraction of the parallel case depending on their angles relative to the shear direction .",
    "and the micro - images of these trajectories share similar properties with those of the trajectory that is parallel to the shear .",
    "figure  [ fig : parallel ] shows that micro - image motions are in the same orders as the bulk motion of macro - image over the timescales considered .",
    "therefore , trajectory direction only has a modest impact on the cloud sizes probed .",
    "these results are in great contrast with those of @xcite , who claimed quasar microlensing for image a of q2237 + 0305 can induce considerable variability of absorption lines associated with structures as large as @xmath109 during the course of years to decades . according to their analysis ,",
    "the effect is largest when the cloud is very close to the source , and for example , the timescale of line strength variation for a @xmath109 cloud very close to the source is given as @xmath110 .",
    "however , in their analysis , they effectively assumed the relative lens - cloud proper motion @xmath111 .",
    "this would lead to a timescale @xmath112 for absorption cloud near the source redshift ( they adopted @xmath113 ) , which is in agreement with column 4 of their table 1 .",
    "in fact , i showed that , when peculiar velocities of the source and cloud are ignored , @xmath114 ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : nopeculiar ] ) , which is not negligible . even considering realistic peculiar motions of the source and the cloud",
    ", it still leads to time scales that are more than one order of magnitude slower than those predicted for @xmath111 .",
    "in addition , when the cloud is close to the source , the angular sizes of the clouds they considered are orders of magnitudes larger than their source size , so effects of changes in magnification pattern on the source plane alone have very little impact as well .",
    "therefore , @xcite significantly overestimated the cloud size to which microlensing is effectively sensitive .",
    "i have shown that there are two effects that might induce variation of absorption lines along the sight lines to lensed quasar .",
    "one effect is caused by the drastic morphological and positional changes of micro - images when the source crosses the caustic network .",
    "the other effect is due to the bulk motion of the `` ray bundles '' relative to the absorption clouds .",
    "i have laid out a basic framework in studying these effects for microlensed quasars in general . and in particular , i perform numerical simulations to apply the method to image a of q2237 + 0305 .",
    "i demonstrated that the combinations of these two effects probe @xmath115 absorption cloudlets between the lens and the source over timescales of months to years .",
    "the existence of these cloudlets will be revealed by either changes in line depths or appearances / disappearances of multi - absorption components .",
    "spectra should preferably be taken during the course of caustic crossings , which can be inferred from photometric monitoring programs of lensed quasars .",
    "in fact , the lines observed by @xcite about 8 years ago already show different multi - components along sight lines of three different macro - images , implying they might be caused by fragmented cloudlets with similar sizes as the micro - images .",
    "a similar high - resolution spectrum taken in the near future would provide a definitive test of the existence for structures of or other metal - line absorbers at the scales of @xmath115 .",
    "if the spectral variations are indeed observed , a statistical study similar to @xcite will be required to infer the properties of the cloudlets . moreover",
    ", a time series of spectra may provide additional constraints to quasar microlensing models .",
