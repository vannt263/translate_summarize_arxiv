    "it has recently been suggested @xcite that in contrast to earlier predictions the commutation relations of photon ladder operators have directly measurable physical significance .",
    "this is especially interesting in the case of resonant structures where conventional theoretical descriptions have been shown to lead to anomalous commutation relations of the general form @xmath0=\\lambda\\neq1 $ ] , instead of the canonical form with @xmath1 @xcite . the anomaly is a direct consequence of the conventional piecewise normalization of the optical modes in respective homogeneous regions and of the interference effects coupling the modes propagating in different directions .",
    "originally these anomalies were argued to bear no physical significance , but recently it has been shown that the anomalous commutation relations lead to the existence of a threshold for second harmonic generation when it occurs inside microcavities @xcite .",
    "in addition , anomalies in the commutation relations have also been shown to prevent systematic description of the local thermal balance between the field and interacting media @xcite .",
    "experimental measurements of the onset of the second harmonic generation or the thermal balance formation in microcavities could therefore confirm the theoretical predictions that the conventional mode normalization introducing these anomalies is not sufficient for field quantization of resonant structures . here , we develop a field quantization approach that ( 1 ) fully eliminates the anomalies for propagating fields , ( 2 ) bridges the classical propagating wave and commutation - relation - preserving quantum descriptions , and ( 3 ) allows formulating conceptually simple models for optical energy transfer and the formation of thermal balance in interfering nanostructures .",
    "one of the most widely used quantization approaches for describing spatial field evolution in resonant structures is the input - output relation formalism of the photon creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the formalism was originally developed for dispersionless and lossless media @xcite and later extended for lossy and dispersive dielectrics by several groups @xcite .",
    "the quantization procedures studied , e.g. , by barnett _",
    "@xcite clearly highlight that the noise and field operators in nonuniform systems are position dependent and that the vector potential and electric - field operators obey the well - known canonical commutation relation as expected @xcite .",
    "the canonical commutation relations in these early models did not , however , extend to the ladder operators which were found to exhibit anomalies in resonant structures @xcite .",
    "the anomalous commutation relations of the ladder operators were later studied in several works @xcite but no clear resolution for the anomalies was found .",
    "instead it was concluded that the anomalies as well as the exact form of the ladder operators within resonant structures were irrelevant as long as the field commutation relations and classical field quantities were well defined . however , this made it impossible to fully quantize the optical fields in resonant structures .    to shed more light on the anomalous commutation relations , we have very recently developed a quantized fluctuational electrodynamics ( qfed ) scheme based on generalizing the fluctuational electrodynamics to quantum optical fields @xcite .",
    "using the qfed approach we were able to formulate the canonical commutation relations preserving ladder and photon - number operators for the total electromagnetic ( em ) field @xcite .",
    "however , even in the qfed framework , it has not been evident how to separate the ladder and photon - number operators to left and right propagating parts , which is also essential for the final resolution of the anomalies and for bridging the classical propagating wave descriptions and the commutation - relation - preserving quantum descriptions . in this work ,",
    "we show that the qfed can be extended to resolve between the left and right propagating fields , fully preserving the canonical commutations with @xmath1 also for the left and right propagating field ladder operators .",
    "as it turns out , the separation to the left and right propagating fields becomes possible and conceptually simple when one introduces a new density of states concept describing the fundamentally important interference effects .",
    "the added insight obtained using the introduced concepts provides a more detailed understanding of the quantization of optical fields in complex surroundings , and can be used , e.g. , for finding simple photon - number - based expressions for the quantum optical poynting vector as well as more detailed description of quantized energy flow in resonant structures .",
    "in contrast to previous approaches , the requirement of the qfed is the preservation of the local canonical commutation relation @xmath2=\\delta(\\omega-\\omega')$ ] also in resonant media @xcite .",
    "this requirement leads to conceptually simple definitions for the position - dependent ladder and photon - number operators as a weighted sum over the incident fields and the noise . for the expectation value of the photon - number operator , for instance ,",
    "this weighted sum reads as @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the source field photon - number expectation value which for thermal fields is given by the bose - einstein distribution @xmath5 $ ] with the position - dependent temperature of the medium given by @xmath6 .",
    "the weighting coefficient @xmath7 in eq .   is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath10 is the area of quantization in the @xmath11-@xmath12 plane , @xmath13 is the relative electric permittivity of a nonmagnetic medium with refractive index @xmath14 and @xmath15 is its imaginary part , @xmath16 is the wave number , and @xmath17 is the green s function of the helmholtz equation given for selected layered structures in ref .  . the quantity @xmath7 is here referred to as the nonlocal density of states ( nldos ) since it highlights the nonlocal origin of the local density of states ( ldos ) @xmath18 given as @xmath19 and appearing in the denominator of eq .",
    "after integration , the ldos can also be expressed in the more familiar form in terms of the imaginary part of the green s function @xcite . using this definition , the nldos @xmath7 accounts for both the electric - field ( term @xmath20 ) and the magnetic - field ( term @xmath21 ) contributions .",
    "the quantum optical poynting vector @xmath22 that will be used as a starting point for separating the field components is defined in terms of the positive ( @xmath23 ) and negative ( @xmath24 ) frequency parts of the electric- and magnetic - field operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 as @xmath27 $ ] @xcite . using the qfed framework and substituting the electric- and magnetic - field operators as given in ref .",
    ", we write the poynting vector expectation value at angular frequency @xmath28 as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the energy propagation velocity , @xmath31 is the real part of the refractive index @xmath32 , and @xmath33 the quantity @xmath34 at field point @xmath35 essentially describes the contributions of the left and right propagating fields originating from the source point @xmath36 .",
    "the term @xmath34 fully accounts for the reflections , losses , and interference and is closely related to the concepts of ldos and nldos .",
    "therefore , we refer to it as the interference density of states ( ifdos ) .",
    "in contrast to the nldos , the integral of the ifdos with respect to @xmath36 is always zero as required , e.g. , by the fact that in a medium in equilibrium , there is no net power flow , i.e. , @xmath37 when @xmath38 is constant .      to generalize the ldos and photon - number concepts in refs .   and and eq .",
    "to separately account for the left and right propagating fields , we write the left and right propagating field poynting vector expectation values @xmath39 and @xmath40 as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the left and right propagating field ldoss and photon numbers to be determined , and the term one half describes the zero - point fluctuation current . the left and right propagating photon numbers must additionally satisfy two equations : the total poynting vector must be given by @xmath44 and the total energy density @xmath45 @xcite by @xmath46 at zero temperature , where @xmath47 , the poynting vector is zero and thus @xmath48 in eq .  .",
    "respectively , eq .   at zero temperature leads to the relation @xmath49 .",
    "together , these conditions uniquely define the left and right propagating ldoss in terms of the total ldos as @xmath50 .    using the above local density of states relations",
    ", we can uniquely solve the left and right propagating photon numbers from eqs .   and as @xmath51^{-1}[\\langle\\hat u(x , t)\\rangle_\\omega\\pm\\langle\\hat s(x , t)\\rangle_\\omega / v(x,\\omega)]-1/2 $ ] .",
    "in terms of the source field photon number this corresponds to @xmath52\\langle\\hat\\eta(x',\\omega)\\rangle dx'}{\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty[\\rho_\\mathrm{nl}(x,\\omega , x')\\pm\\rho_\\mathrm{if}(x,\\omega , x')]dx'}.$ } }   \\label{eq : directionaln}\\ ] ] equation shows that the propagating field photon - number expectation values are also obtained as a weighted sum of the source field values , but the weight factor now includes an additional term describing the interference and propagation direction . in the denominator , one can neglect @xmath34 as it integrates to zero indicating that the denominator is simply equal to the ldos in eq .  .",
    "above we have only focused on the photon - number expectation values that can be directly extracted from the poynting vector . to find the corresponding ladder and photon - number operators in the qfed we will further investigate the forms of the photon annihilation operators @xmath53 and @xmath54 that lead to the expectation values in eq .   and fulfill the canonical commutation relations .",
    "the photon annihilation operators fulfilling these conditions are of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a bosonic source field operator obeying the canonical commutation relation @xmath57 = \\delta(x - x')\\delta(\\omega-\\omega')$ ] and which is related to the source field photon number as @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the phase factor @xmath59 is in principle arbitrary and it does not play a role in our calculations as it cancels in the commutators . the total field annihilation operator @xmath60 is given by the sum @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the left and right propagating field annihilation operators in eq .",
    "also obey the commutation relation of the form @xmath62 = \\delta(\\omega-\\omega')$ ] . with these choices , however , the cross - commutators become nonzero as @xmath63\\neq0 $ ] due to the coupling of the left and right propagating fields originating from the same source points by the reflecting interfaces .",
    "this cross - commutator form is intuitively reasonable and does not appear to present any complications as the only commutation relations directly linked to the studied physical observables are the self - commutators .    as shown by eqs .   and",
    "it is necessary to separately account for all the individual source points and their mutual interference to arrive to the correctly commutating operator forms .",
    "similar book keeping is also present in classical fluctuational electrodynamics ( fed ) .",
    "in contrast to the fed , however , to describe the quantum features the photon ladder and number operators need to be renormalized to fully satisfy the commutation relations .",
    "in addition to describing the total energy density and energy flow presented in eqs .",
    ", , and , the qfed formalism is also capable of separating the total field photon numbers to their local electric- and magnetic - field equivalents @xmath64 and @xmath65 that are responsible for direct interactions with materials and determine , e.g. , the self - consistent local temperature of the interacting media as discussed in refs .   and .",
    "essentially these electric- or magnetic - field specific quantities and the corresponding ldoss can be obtained by using eqs .",
    "and when only the electric- or magnetic - field term in the nldos in eq .",
    "is taken into account @xcite .",
    "the electric- and magnetic - field specific quantities were previously shown to have quite distinct properties as compared to the total field quantities and to include , e.g. , oscillations in the field temperatures @xcite . in the propagating operator formalism , however , the electric- and magnetic - field specific ladder operators",
    "are again united with the total propagating field operators because the direct interference effects between the left and right propagating fields have been eliminated when projecting the ladder operators to the left and right propagating operators .",
    "this fully agrees with our previous results @xcite : in the present formalism the separation to left and right propagating fields also fully separates the interference effects from the local fields , whereas the formalism simultaneously capturing both left and right propagating fields in a single term must also capture the interference effects .",
    "to better illustrate the physical implications of the presented concepts we briefly discuss the properties of photon numbers of the left and right propagating fields and compare them to the corresponding total field photon number in an optical cavity consisting of three homogeneous layers as illustrated in fig .",

    "in contrast , e.g. , to the electric - field values where resonance effects can substantially increase the field magnitude inside a resonator , the photon - number values inside the cavity and at the outputs in eq .",
