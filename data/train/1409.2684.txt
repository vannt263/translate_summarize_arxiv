    "wr  48a  is a carbon - rich ( wc ) wolf - rayet star ( wr ) that was discovered in a near - infrared survey by danks et al .",
    "it is located inside the g305 star - forming region in the scutum crux arm of the galaxy .",
    "two compact infrared clusters ( danks 1 and 2 ) are found in its vicinity ( within @xmath4 ) which indicates that this wr star likely originates from one or the other @xcite .",
    "the most pronounced characteristics of wr  48a  deduced from observations are : ( a ) its optical extinction is very high , a@xmath5  mag @xcite ( b ) it is a strong and variable infrared source ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; ( c ) it is very luminous and variable in x - rays ( @xcite , 2014 ) .",
    "the infrared variability of wr  48a  suggests that it is a long - period episodic dust maker with short - term ` flares ' superimposed on a much gradually changing emission ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a recent study revealed a recurrent dust formation on a timescale of more than 32 years which also indicates that wr  48a   is very likely a wide colliding - wind binary @xcite .",
    "however , the case of wr  48a  might not be that simple . for example , @xcite reported detection of a _ thermal _ radio source ( spectral index @xmath6 , f@xmath7 ) associated with wr  48a , while the wide colliding - wind binaries are in general _ non - thermal _ radio sources @xcite",
    ".    nonetheless , we note that the x - ray properties of wr  48a  provide additional support for the binary nature of this wc star .",
    "analysis of the _ xmm - newton  _ and _ chandra  _ spectra of wr  48a  showed that ( @xcite , 2014 ) : ( i ) its x - ray emission is of thermal origin ; ( ii ) this is the most x - ray luminous wr star in the galaxy detected so far , after the black - hole candidate cyg x-3 ; ( iii ) the x - ray emission is variable and the same is valid for the x - ray absorption to this object .",
    "all these x - ray characteristics are well explained in the framework of the colliding - stellar - wind ( csw ) picture although specific information from different spectral domains is yet needed for carrying out a detailed quantitative modelling .    in this study ,",
    "our goal was to undertake the first attempts to derive various physical characteristics of wr  48a  in different spectral domains .",
    "to do so , we obtained new optical and near - infrared spectra of wr  48a . also , we made use of some data from the optical , radio and x - ray archives of various ground - based and space observatories .",
    "all this , the new and archival data , allowed us to derive valuable pieces of information on the evolution of the physical characteristics of wr  48a .",
    "we could thus start building a global picture of this fascinating object based on a multi - wavelength view of its properties . in section [ sec : observations ] , we review the observational information in different spectral domains . in section [ sec : results ] , we describe our results .",
    "we discuss the results from our analysis in section [ sec : discussion ] and list our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "we obtained new optical and near - infrared ( nir ) spectra of wr  48a  with the southern african large telescope ( salt ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the 1.9 m telescope at the south african astronomical observatory and the new technology telescope ( ntt ) at the european southern observatory ( eso ) .",
    "our search in the archives of various ground - based observatories in the southern hemisphere found one useful optical observation with the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) at the anglo - australian observatory .",
    "we give next some basic information on these data and the corresponding data reduction .            _ salt . _",
    "the salt spectra of wr  48a  were obtained with the robert stobie spectrograph ( rss ; @xcite ; @xcite ) on 2012 may 27 .",
    "the spectrum of a bright , nearby b star ( cpd-62 3058 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : salt_slit ] ) was obtained with the same setup on 2012 may 24 . in the rss long - slit spectroscopy mode",
    ", the volume phase holographic ( vph ) gratings pg1800 and pg2300 were used in the spectral range 4000 - 8800 . the whole spectrum in this region",
    "was obtained in five shots covering the subregions 4050 - 5100 , 4880 - 5850 , 5810 - 6670 ,",
    "6640 - 7840  and 7790 - 8840 , respectively .",
    "spectra of thar , ne and xe comparison arcs were obtained to calibrate the wavelength scale .",
    "the slit width was 15 and its position on the sky is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : salt_slit ] .",
    "the position of the slit was chosen in this way , to be able to obtain the spectra of wr  48a  and the wc8 star d2 - 3  ( 2mass j13125770 - 6240599 ) simultaneously .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : salt_slit ] , four additional stars are well located in the slit and their spectra were also considered in this paper ( see appendix  [ append : stars ] ) .",
    "the spectral resolution in the particular subregions , estimated by the full widths at the half maximum ( fwhm ) of the extracted comparison spectra lines , is as follows : @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11  and @xmath12 . for the flux calibration , we used spectra of the spectrophotometric standard stars ltt4364 , ltt7987 and feige110 , obtained in the nights of may 24 and 27 .",
    "the initial data reduction , including bias and overscan subtraction , gain and cross - talk corrections , trimming and mosaicking , was done with the salt science pipeline @xcite .",
    "we used the dcr software written by w.  pych ( see @xcite for details ) to remove the cosmic rays from the observations . to perform the flat field corrections , the wavelength calibration and to correct the distortion and the tilt of the frames we used the standard iraf tasks in the twospec package .",
    "the nights of our observations were not photometric . moreover , salt is a telescope with a variable pupil which makes the absolute flux calibration impossible .",
    "thus , we calibrated the spectra in relative flux units using an average sensitivity curve .",
    "this allowed us to derive the relative spectral energy distribution of the studied objects .",
    "the normalized salt spectra of wr  48a  and d2 - 3  are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : salt_spec ] .    a low - resolution spectrum of wr  48a  was acquired on 2013 july 17 with the grating spectrograph with a site ccd mounted on the 1.9 m radcliffe telescope at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) .",
    "grating number7 with 300 linesmm@xmath3 and a  slit width of @xmath13 were used . to calibrate the spectra in relative flux ,",
    "the spectrophotometric standard star eg21 was used . all the data reduction and calibrations",
    "were carried out with the standard iraf procedures .",

    "the spectral resolution is 13.92 a ( the full width at the half maximum ) .",
    "bright stars of spectral type g were observed as a measure of the atmospheric absorption .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the standard iraf procedures : correction for the bad pixels , bias level and sky emission lines subtraction , flat fielding , spectrum extraction , wavelength calibration and telluric correction ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , no flux calibration was possible and this is why the j - spectrum was normalized to the stellar continuum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ntt_spec ] ) and used for spectral line analysis only .",
    "_ we downloaded from the aat archive two spectra of wr  48a  ( the same ones used by @xcite ) obtained with the rgo spectrograph on 1993 june 21 .",
    "the spectra were reduced and calibrated by the use of the standard iraf packages .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard star ltt377 , observed during the same night , was used for the relative flux - calibration of the spectra .",

    "we have checked the available data in the australia telescope online archive and made use of the radio observations taken on 2000 feb 27 ( project code c862 ; atca configuration 6a ) and on 2006 dec 8 ( project code c1610 ; atca configuration 6b ) . during the project c862 ,",
    "wr  48a  was observed at four frequencies 1.4 , 2.5 , 4.8 & 8.6ghz with a bandwidth of 128mhz .",
    "however due to data quality , we were able to recover fluxes only at 4.8 & 8.6ghz .",
    "at the two lower frequencies , there were a lot of interferences in the data that resulted in unreliable maps .",
    "because of that , we were unable to make any conclusions about the wr  48a  radio fluxes at 1.4 and 2.5 ghz .",
    "in the project c1610 , wr  48a  was observed at two frequencies 4.8 & 8.6ghz with a bandwidth of 128mhz ( fig .",

    "we were able to reduce all data and estimate the wr  48a   fluxes at both used radio bands .",
    "1934 - 638 was used as a primary flux calibrator in both bands but different phase calibrators were chosen : 1251 - 713 for c862 and 1352 - 63 for c1610 , respectively .",
    "the whole data reduction process was carried out using the standard nrao aips procedures .",
    "the task imagr was used to produce the final total intensity images of wr  48a .",
    "radio fluxes were then measured , by fitting gaussian model using the aips task jmfit .      to broaden the study of the x - ray properties of wr  48a , especially ,",
    "that on its long - term x - ray variability , we have checked the archives of the modern x - ray observatories ( e.g. , _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , _ rosat _ , _ swift _ ) .",
    "thus , in addition to the already analysed and published data ( see @xcite , 2014 ) , we found two _ rosat  _ and 33 pointed _ swift  _ observations .",

    "( obsid : 8922 ) but the pileup in the acis ccd is very high ( see footnote 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , we used the chandra interactive analysis of observations 4.4.1 data analysis software to formally extract an x - ray source spectrum and the background emission in the source vicinity ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : xrayimages ] ) . we could thus estimate the source background - subtracted count rate . despite being affected by the strong pileup , we made some use of this parameter in the discussion of the x - ray light curve of wr  48a   ( see section  [ subsec : xray_lc ] ) .",
    "for the spectral simulations in this study , we made use of version 11.3.2 of xspec  @xcite .",
    "for wr  48a  and d2 - 3 , we measured the equivalent width ( ew ) and the full width at the half maximum ( fwhm ) for all the spectral lines that were detected in the optical and nir spectra at hand : salt , aat blue and red channels , eso ntt , saao 1.9 m telescopes . before estimating the fwhm values in units of  km s@xmath3  , we corrected them for the instrumental broadening : @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the spectral resolution for the given spectrum , see section  [ subsec : optical ] ) .    the corresponding results for wr  48a  are given in table  1 . since the equivalent widths do not depend on the spectral resolution , their values can give an indication for spectral changes .",
    "the ew ratios from the wr  48a  spectra over a time difference of about 20 years are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ew ] .",
    "we see that there is some indication that spectral lines ( especially , hydrogen - helium lines ) in the optical are stronger in 2012 ( the salt observation ) , while the spectral lines in the nir were stronger in 1993 ( the aat observation ) .",
    "the latter is likely due to appearance of some strong continuum in the nir , probably a dust emission in 2012 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the fwhm values of the optical - nir emission lines in wr  48a  give some indication for a possible presence of two gas flows different in kinematic sense .",
    "namely , we see that all the ` cool ' lines ( hei and hi lines ) are considerably narrower than those of high - excitation ionic species ( e.g. civ ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : ew ] ( right panel ) is an illustration of this difference .",
    "we note that the civ lines in wr  48a  are as broad as in the wc8 star d2 - 3  ( table  [ tab : wc8_lines ] )",
    ". then , could it be that these ` hot ' lines belong to the wc8 star in wr  48a  while the narrower helium - hydrogen lines ( the ` cool ' lines ) belong to its companion star ?",

    ".d2 - 3 : emission lines [ cols= \" > , > , > \" , ]     note  given are the absorption line identification or the dib wavelength ( @xmath26 ) in    and its equivalent width ( ew ) in    for cpd-62  3058 , s1 , s2 , s3 and s4 , respectively .",
    "+ @xmath27 likely blended with a stellar line .    for the s1 star , which is a member of the open cluster danks 2 @xcite ,",
    "the strength of the interstellar absorption features in its spectrum is very similar to that in the spectra of d2 - 3  and wr  48a  ( see table  [ tab : dibs ] ) .",
    "this is a solid indication that all the three objects are located at about the same distance from us .",
    "also , the interstellar extinction to s1 is consistent with that to d2 - 3  ( @xmath28 vs. @xmath29 mag ; see section  [ subsubsec : wc8_fit ] ) , which gives additional confidence for the results from our spectral fits .    the relatively small values of the interstellar extinction derived for cpd-62  3058 and s2 indicate that these objects are likely foreground stars .",
    "we note that the @xmath30 value for cpd-62  3058 is in acceptable correspondence with that ( @xmath31  mag ) reported by @xcite . the situation with the stars s3 and s4 is inconclusive because of the quality of their salt spectra ( see also table  [ tab : add_dibs ] ) .",
    "the adopted technique for the global spectral fits to the optical spectra of wr  48a  was discussed in sections  [ subsec : fits ] and [ subsubsec : wr48a_fit ] .",
    "we only recall that a two - component fit was used in this analysis .",
    "since wr  48a  was classified as wolf - rayet star of the wc8 type , the first component of the fit was the salt spectrum of the wc8 star d2 - 3  whose spectrum was derived simultaneously with that of wr  48a  ( see section  [ sec : observations ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : salt_slit ] ) . for the second component in the wr  48a  fit ,",
    "we used spectra from stelib library @xcite or from the archives of various observatories .",
    "the salt and aat spectra were fitted as the interstellar extinction was also taken into account .",
    "another important parameter derived in the fits is the relative brightness of the stellar components .",
    "this is denoted by the difference of the intrinsic v - magnitude of the wc8 star ( @xmath32 ) and its companion star ( @xmath33 ) : @xmath34 .",
    "the results from these global fits were presented in section  [ subsubsec : wr48a_fit ] in the case of a wn8h spectrum as a second spectral component .",
    "these fits gave the best match to the optical salt and aat spectra of wr  48a .",
    "figure  [ fig : lbv ] presents some results from the global fits if the second component is a spectrum of a lbv , o or b star , respectively .",
    "we see that these fits are not able to match well the relatively narrow spectral lines of helium and hydrogen ( hei 5876 , 6678   , h@xmath35  6563   ) . on the other hand ,",
    "these fit results confirm one of the basic findings discussed in section  [ subsubsec : wr48a_fit ] .",
    "namely , the interstellar extinction in the salt spectrum ( 2012 may ) of wr  48a  is higher than in its aat spectrum ( 1993 june ) .",
    "they also establish the relative variability ( change ) between the strengths of the wc8 spectral component and that of the companion star ."
