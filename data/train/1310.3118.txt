    "a strongly nonlinear , coherently precessing localized mode termed a droplet soliton was observed in a nanocontact spin torque oscillator ( nc - sto ) with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the observed droplet exhibited a number of intriguing features including sub - ferromagnetic resonance frequencies , low frequency modulations , and an almost complete reversal of the magnetization within its core , hence a perimeter precession angle of 180 degrees . supporting micromagnetic simulations demonstrated that the low frequency modulations could be due to an oscillation of the droplet within the nanocontact resulting from some restoring force .",
    "previous theoretical studies of the nc - sto droplet neglected long range dipolar interactions and observed a drift instability whereby the droplet was ejected from the nanocontact @xcite",

    "a modulation theory can be developed whereby the soliton s parameters are allowed to vary adiabatically in time @xcite .",
    "the resulting soliton modulation equations are analogous to thiele s equation @xcite for the motion of a magnetic domain or vortex .",
    "one symmetry breaking example is the dissipative droplet soliton , excited in the spin - transfer torque ( stt ) driven nc - sto where translational invariance and time reversal symmetry are broken @xcite .",
    "this is precisely the soliton observed in the previously discussed experiment @xcite . in steady state",

    "modulation theory generalizes the steady state conditions by allowing for slow temporal variations of the conservative droplet s parameters due to the symmetry breaking perturbations . in effect , the droplet is treated as a slowly moving , precessing dipole particle .    in order to make analytical progress tractable and to enable efficient micromagnetic simulations , magnetic soliton studies often neglect the long range component of the magnetostatic field , inherent in any magnetic sample that exhibits a nonuniform magnetization distribution .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation in the case of very thin , extended magnetic films @xcite where the magnetostatic field takes the local form @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the component of the magnetization perpendicular to the film ) ; however , thickness - dependent , long range corrections can be important @xcite .",
    "these corrections lead to a breaking of phase invariance @xcite .    here , we present the stationary droplet soliton modulation equations for symmetry breaking perturbations . an approximate , analytical representation of the conservative droplet in the strongly nonlinear regime is discussed and used to greatly simplify the modulation equations .",
    "the effects of the long range magnetostatic field , a nc - sto , and magnetic damping are studied in detail by a dynamical systems analysis of the modulation equations .",

    "finally , we have neglected coupling to radiation modes in this analysis which is , for example , important in the small amplitude regime of nc - stos @xcite .",
    "it is important to point out that the negative frequency shift due to long range magnetostatic effects is independent of and does not influence the results pertaining to nc - sto and damping perturbations . recalling that @xmath54 , stationary droplets in the absence of long range magnetostatics and applied field are always dynamic .",
    "the negative frequency shift suggests that a droplet in a sufficiently thick film could be static , which would correspond to a magnetic bubble @xcite .",
    "however , this regime is strictly outside the validity range of the asymptotic expression so it is likely that a non - perturbative analysis is required for further investigation .",
    "micromagnetic simulations and experimentally observed low frequency modulations in ref .   suggest the existence of a restoring force due to the nc - sto .",
    "our analysis presented here precisely describes how this restoring force arises , as the manifestation of a stable fixed point and its basin of attraction . that the dissipative soliton in the nc - sto is not a global attractor was observed in micromagnetic simulations previously in the form of the drift instability @xcite .",
    "as it is known that a magnetic field gradient can accelerate a stationary droplet @xcite , we postulate that stt provides a restoring force that can keep the droplet inside the nanocontact for a sufficiently small gradient .",
    "these competing effects could also account for the observed shift of the droplet with respect to the nc - sto center when oersted fields are included in the model .",
    "however , a sufficiently strong field gradient that overcomes the stt restoring force can lead to expulsion of the droplet , hence a drift instability . because a field gradient perturbation does not maintain the constraint , further investigation of this requires the study of modulated propagating droplets in the presence of an nc - sto .",
    "an additional experimental implication of our results is that of a restricted regime of droplet soliton excitation . in nc - stos",
    ", droplets can be nucleated by a spin wave instability ( subcritical hopf bifurcation ) associated with the uniform state @xmath127 @xcite .",

    "furthermore , fig .",
    "[ fig : h0-stab ] shows that a large applied field shifts the minimum sustaining current to higher values . since the spin wave instability only weakly depends on the applied field @xcite , a sufficiently large field may shift the stable dissipative soliton branch above a given applied current so that the droplet is no longer nucleated in a nc - sto",
    "using singular perturbation theory we have derived modulation equations for parameters of a droplet soliton under very general perturbations .",
    "this theory was applied to two such physically relevant perturbations : 1 ) higher - order , long range effects of the magnetostatic field and 2 ) damping and spin transfer torque forcing in a nanocontact spin torque oscillator .",
    "the key result is that these long range effects result in a down shift of the overall droplet frequency . for a nc - sto system",
    ", we predict that a droplet shifted from the nanocontact center can be drawn back by a stt - induced restoring force .",
    "sufficiently large shifts cause damping to overwhelm stt effects so that the droplet soliton is no longer an attractor , hence decays into spin waves . for both perturbations investigated we see good agreement between micromagnetic simulations and the reduced order models proposed here .",

    "<S> further analysis also demonstrates the onset of a saddle - node bifurcation at the minimum sustaining current for the nc - sto . </S>",
    "<S> the basin of attraction associated with the stable node demonstrates that spin torque enacts a restoring force to excursions of the droplet from the nanocontact center , observed previously in numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> large excursions lead to the droplet s eventual decay into spin waves . </S>"
