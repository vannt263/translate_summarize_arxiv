    "as an increasing number of artificial satellites or spacecrafts have been and are being launched into deeper space since 1960s , the problem of controlling the translational motion of a spacecraft in the gravitational field of multiple celestial bodies such that some cost functionals are minimized or maximized arises in astronautics .",
    "the circular restricted three - body problem ( crtbp ) , which though as a degenerate model in celestial mechanics can capture the chaotic property of @xmath1-body problem , is extensively used in the literature in recent years to study optimal trajectories in deeper space .",

    "the present paper is concerned with the @xmath0-minimization problem for the translational motion of a spacecraft in a crtbp , which aims at minimizing the @xmath0-norm of control . therefore ,",
    "if the control is generated by propulsion systems which expel mass in a high speed to generate an opposite reaction force according to newton s third law of motion , the @xmath0-minimization problem is referred to as the well - known fuel - optimal control problem in astronautics .",
    "the existence of the @xmath0-minimization solutions in crtbps can be obtained by a combination of filippov theorem in ref . @xcite and the technique in ref .",

    "@xcite , the synthesis of the solutions of singular extremals in 3-dimensional ( 3d ) case , to the author s knowledge , is not covered up to the present time .",
    "therefore , in this paper , in addition to an emphasis on the necessary conditions arising from the pontryagin maximum principle ( pmp ) , which reveals the existences of bang - bang and singular controls , the solutions of singular extremals are investigated to show that the @xmath0-minimization trajectories in 3d case can exhibit fuller or chattering phenomena according to the theories developed by marchal in ref .",

    "even though one does not consider singular and chattering controls , the bang - bang type of control as well as the chaotic property in crtbps makes the computation of the @xmath0-minimization solutions a big challenge . to address this challenge , various numerical methods ,",
