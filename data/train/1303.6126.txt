    "exploration of the phenomenon of pulsar kicks i.e. the observed large escape velocities of neutron stars ( ns ) out of supernova remnants has drawn significant attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "understanding the origin of such high velocities , the so called kick velocities and its connection with pulsar spin has been the subject of many theoretical models @xcite .",
    "however , one of the most natural explanations for these large escape velocities could be due to anisotropic neutrino emission from quark matter present at the core of the ns @xcite with which we are presently concerned .",
    "it is well known that neutrinos carry away almost all of the energy released during the supernova and following proto - neutron star evolution .",
    "it is estimated that an asymmetry of roughly about @xmath1 percent in neutrino momentum is sufficient enough to generate such phenomenal velocities @xcite . for a ns with quark matter core in normal phase ,",
    "the main mechanism of neutrino emission has been the quark direct and inverse urca processes given by @xcite , & & du+e^-+|_e [ dir ] & & u+e^-d+_e [ inv ] the above two reactions .",
    "these scatterings in presence of a strong magnetic field can give rise to asymmetric neutrino emission as explained in @xcite .",
    "the possibility of the presence of strong magnetic fields in the ns core has been suggested by various authors . at the core of a ns",
    ", the magnetic field strength can go upto @xmath2 as shown in @xcite using scalar virial theorem .",
    "there are few other models too , which support similar values of the magnetic field @xcite . on the surface of the ns ,",
    "relatively weaker magnetic fields of @xmath3 have been estimated @xcite .",
    "such high magnetic field could lead to higher asymmetry in the neutrino momentum distribution .",
    "this asymmetric neutrino emission is actually related to the electron polarisation opposite to the direction of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the electron polarisation for different conditions of magnetic field and kick velocities has been studied recently by sagert et .",
    "in these works , the authors have discussed pulsar acceleration mechanism based on asymmetric neutrino emission from quark direct urca process in the core of the ns . here the dependence of the kick velocity with the quark phase temperature and quark phase radius of the star with varying quark chemical potentials has been studied .",
    "it is to be noted , that for such a high magnetic field strength , the electron motions are quantized .",
    "hence in the present treatment , we need to invoke quantized energy states populated by various landau levels which shall be discussed later .",
    "the critical value for which this quantisation effect becomes important is given by @xmath4 for electrons and @xmath5 for quarks respectively .",
    "in fact in the strong magnetic field limit what we consider here , electrons are likely to occupy only the lowest landau level wth electron spin opposite to the direction of magnetic field .",
    "as the motivation of the present work is to calculate the pulsar kick velocity of magnetized ns composed of degenerate quark matter , we need to know various related quantities like specific heat @xcite and neutrino emissivity @xcite in presence of strong magnetic field .",
    "these quantities in turn determine the kick velocity .",
    "it might be mentioned in this context that the specific heat of the degenerate quark matter or the emissivity at such high quark density receive significant corrections from the qcd sector which shows nfl behavior in the relativistic regime due to dominance of the magnetic interaction over the electric one . in the non - relativistic limit however , such magnetic corrections due to transverse gluon mediated processes are @xmath6 suppressed @xcite .",
    "the central aim of the present work is to expose the role of magnetic interactions on various thermodynamic quantities as well as quark dispersion relations in ultradegenerate quark matter .",
    "it is now known from a series of works that in the relativistic regime the magnetic interaction dominates over its electric counterpart @xcite .",
    "for instance , one can mention that for normal fl , the damping width which is actually related to quark - quark scattering rates goes as @xmath7 unlike the coulomb plasma where @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "similar departure have also been observed in the calculation of specific heat capacity and pressure @xcite .",
    "examples of momentum drag and diffusion coefficients can also be cited where similar deviation from the normal fl behavior has been observed @xcite . in particular , the nfl behavior of the specific heat is most important in the the present context as it directly determines the cooling rate of the star .",
    "the nfl correction in this case involve @xmath9 term which has been dubbed as anomalous corrections in many of the recent literatures @xcite .",
    "however the entire calculation did not consider the possibility of nfl correction to the kick velocity which we consider in the present work .",
    "furthermore , in presence of strong magnetic field , the specific heat will also receive nfl corrections .",
    "the latter has been studied extensively for unmagnetized matter but for magnetized matter , so far previous works are confined only to non - interacting quark matter @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "hence , two major points which we highlight here is the inclusion of nfl correction to the pulsar kick velocity and the calculation of specific heat in presence of strong magnetic field . in our work",
    ", leading order ( lo ) refers to the anomalous logarithmic term @xmath11 that occurs as the first term in the non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) correction to the one - loop quark self energy .",
    "quantities such as specific heat ( @xmath12 ) or entropy ( @xmath13 ) calculated with this term are called lo corrections . in the present work ,",
    "nlo terms include all other terms beyond lo that contain the fractional powers of @xmath14 and upto @xmath15 that occurs in the expression of the quark self energy .",
    "similarly , quantities calculated with this term are labelled as nlo corrections .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the formalism to calculate the kick velocity and calculate the velocity for different conditions of the magnetic field taking into account the nfl effect in specific heat capacity of magnetized quark matter .",
    "we present the results in section iii followed by conclusion in section iv .",
    "neutron star is composed mainly of neutrons with a fraction of protons .",
    "proton fraction may depend on various models . in presence of magnetic field ,",
    "the proton fraction may increase @xcite .",
    "we , however focus on the core of the ns where the density is expected to be so high that the relevant degrees of freedom may be considered to be quarks rather than hadrons @xcite .",
    "the pulsar kick velocity can be calculated if the luminosity , quark phase radius of the ns and the neutrino emissivity is known .",
    "the emissivity is related , as we shall see , with the specific heat of the core .",
    "initially , total neutrino luminosity ( l ) can be approximated as @xcite , lr^3 where r is the quark phase radius of the ns and @xmath16 is the neutrino emissivity .",
    "thus , due to momentum conservation we have , m_ns = l in the above expression , the polarisation fraction of the electrons has been denoted by @xmath17 and mass of the ns by @xmath18 .",
    "the total neutrino emission is polarised in a specific direction .",
    "generally , it is considered that only a fraction @xmath17 of all neutrinos are polarised in one direction .",
    "the value of this fraction depends on number of spin polarised electrons in comparison to the total number of electrons .",
    "therefore the kick velocity can be written as @xcite , @xmath19 using the cooling equation , @xmath20 one can rewrite eq.([diffv ] ) in terms of the specific heat of the quark matter core .",
    "eq.([diffv ] ) and eq.([cooleq ] ) allow one to calculate the pulsar kick velocity .",
    "recently , such a calculation has already been performed in @xcite .",
    "however there , the modification of the specific heat due to presence of magnetic field has not been considered .",
    "we also extend the previous calculation by incorporating lo and nlo correction in the specific heat with and without incorporating the effects due to the presence of magnetic field in the specific heat",
    ".      it will be interesting to see how the thermodynamic potential and associated quantities are modified in the presence of external magnetic field in the core of the ns . in this section",
    ", we shall investigate the effect of strong magnetic field responsible for the quantisation of the orbital motion of charged particles already known in literature as landau diamagnetism .",
    "now , in the presence of a constant magnetic field @xmath21 along the @xmath22 axis , the thermodynamic potential is modified as @xcite , ^b=-_=0^_0^dp_z(1+e^(- ) ) where @xmath23 is the single particle energy eigen value and @xmath24 is the quark degeneracy . for the case of spin-@xmath25 particles the orbital angular momentum @xmath26",
    "is related to @xmath27 as @xcite , 2=2n+s+1 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 refers to spin up @xmath30 or down @xmath31 states .",
    "now , we use the following identity to evaluate the integration , _",
    "0^=_0^h()d+t^2h^()+t^4h^()+ ... thus , for the case of lowest landau level @xmath32 , we obtain , ^b & = & -_0^ + & & -considering @xmath33 and @xmath34 quarks only , we get the total heat capacity per unit volume as , c_v_fl^b= ( ) [ cvflb ] which can be obtained from , s=-()_and the entropy and specific heat of the quarks in the regime of low temperature is given as , c_vt ( ) _    the qcd interaction was not considered in earlier literatures for the calculation of the specific heat of quarks .",
    "recently , it has been shown by several authors that this interaction mediated by gluons can lead to significant corrections in the specific heat which essentially leads to the nfl behavior @xcite . to extend the calculation of the specific heat beyond the fl result",
    ", one needs to incorporate the interaction term in the picture .",
    "mathematically , this requires the knowledge of the one loop quark self energy ( qse ) . to evaluate the one loop quark self energy in degenerate plasma",
    ", one needs to consider fig.([figqse ] ) , where the solid line represents the fermion propagator and the wavy line with the blob implies that the gluon propagator used here is a hard dense loop corrected propagator . in the domain of high density and low temperature @xmath35 which is the region of interest in the context of neutron star the qse can be written as follows @xcite , @xmath36\\nn\\\\    & & + { i ( \\epsilon-\\mu)\\over24\\pi m }     \\,+{2^{1/3}\\sqrt{3}\\over45\\pi^{7/3}}\\left({(\\epsilon-\\mu)\\over m}\\right)^{5/3}(\\mathrm{sgn}(\\epsilon-\\mu)-\\sqrt{3}i)\\qquad\\nn\\\\     & & + { i\\over64 \\sqrt{2}}\\left({(\\epsilon-\\mu)\\over m}\\right)^2     -20{2^{2/3}\\sqrt{3}\\over189\\pi^{11/3}}\\left({(\\epsilon-\\mu)\\over m}\\right)^{7/3}(\\mathrm{sgn}(\\epsilon-\\mu)+\\sqrt{3}i)\\qquad\\nn\\\\   & & -{6144 - 256\\pi^2 + 36\\pi^4 - 9\\pi^6\\over864\\pi^6}\\big({(\\epsilon-\\mu)\\over m }      \\big)^3 \\big[\\log\\left({{0.928}\\,m\\over ( \\epsilon-\\mu)}\\right)\\nn\\\\   & & -{i\\pi\\mathrm{sgn}(\\epsilon-\\mu)\\over 2 }   \\big ] + \\mathcal{o}\\big(\\left({(\\epsilon-\\mu)\\over m}\\right)^{11/3}\\big ) \\big\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , incorporating the nfl lo result into the expression of the entropy ( or specific heat ) in absence of any external magnetic field by using the real part of qse as calculated already in the work of @xcite , c_v_lo=_0^dp p^2 ( p- ) ( ) where @xmath37 and the debye mass ( @xmath38 ) without magnetic field is @xcite , m_d^2 in presence of external magnetic field @xmath21 , the above equation is modified as , c_v^(i)_lo^b=()_=0^_0^d(- ) ( ) where i = u or d quark .",

    "similarly , the nfl nlo decreases by @xmath94 and @xmath95 over the nfl lo when magnetic field effect is excluded and included respectively .",
    "we have obtained the result considering fully polarised electrons , thus making the electron polarisation fraction ( @xmath17 ) equal to unity .",

    "we note that there is a considerable decrease in the radius of the quark phase due to the anomalous nfl lo corrections .",
    "however there is only a modest dimunition in the radius of the quark phase of the ns due to nfl nlo correction to the kick velocity for all the cases .    in fig.([fig2 ] ) , for a large value of magnetic field , we have generated the plot numerically for the case of highly polarised electrons as in eqn.([pol_4 ] ) .",
    "we have found that there is an appreciable change of the @xmath96 relationship of the ns due to lo although the results are not very different from the fully polarised case for a given order .",
    "however , the nlo correction to the kick velocity does not show considerable change from the lo result as evident from the graphs . in the left panel ,",
    "we have ignored the effect of the magnetic field on the specific heat whereas in the right panel we have considered the effect of the external magnetic field on the specific heat .",

    "the lo correction lowers the quark phase radius of the ns for a specific value of temperature .",
    "we have found out that the nlo results impose a slight correction to the lo results . in this case",

    "but , the nfl nlo correction reduces the kick velocity as compared to the nfl lo result .",
    "in this work , we have derived the expressions of the pulsar kick velocity including the nfl corrections to the specific heat of the degenerate quark matter core .",
    "the contributions from the electron polarization ( @xmath17 ) for different cases has also been taken into account to calculate the velocities .",
    "in addition , comparison has been made between the nfl lo and nlo contributions to the kick velocity with the fl case .",
    "we have included the effect of the external magnetic field into the specific heat of the degenerate quark matter for the calculation of the pulsar kick velocity .",
    "the calculation of the specific heat of the degenerate quark matter in magnetic field for the nfl lo and nlo are new and have not been reported earlier .",
    "for all the remaing cases , a kick velocity of the order of @xmath97 is generated which is still low for a wide class of pulsars having average speed of about @xmath98 .",
    "we have found that the nfl lo contributions are significant while calculating the radius - temperature relationship as seen from the graphs presented for the case of the neutron star with moderate and high magnetic field .",
    "the anomalous corrections introduced to the pulsar kick velocity due to the nfl ( lo ) behavior increases appreciably the kick velocity for a particular value of radius and temperature .",
    "however , for all the cases , no appreciable change in the r - t relationship has been observed for the nlo correction with respect to the lo case .",
    "it is to be noted that we have performed our calculations for magnetic field as high as @xmath99 g .",
    "such high magnetic field may not be realised in the core of a neutron star .",
    "moreover , for magnetic fields larger than @xmath100 g , the longitudinal pressure becomes negative resulting in mechanical instability of quark matter @xcite .",
    "as magnetic field enhances the effect of the nfl correction to the kick velocity , we have assumed such high value for the estimation of the maximum velocity due to anisotropic neutrino emission from the quark core taking into account nfl corrections to the specific heat .",
    "finally , we note that we have considered 2-flavour system as @xmath49 quark is not fully relativistic .",
    "however , it might be mentioned that both direct and inverse urca processes for @xmath49 quark becomes important beyond certain critical density .",
    "in addition , introduction of @xmath49 quark may influence the neutrino emissivity by modifying the population of electrons and their spin polarization .",
    "the effect of including the strange quarks into the system should be investigated separately .",
