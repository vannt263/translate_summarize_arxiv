    "dihadron azimuthal correlation has been a successful tool in understanding the interactions between jet and medium , and in extracting the properties of the sqgp . over the years",
    ", the correlation analyses have been carried out in various regions of transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) for the triggers and partners .",
    "many interesting features have been discovered . in the high @xmath0 region ,",
    "the correlation distributions show narrow peaks around @xmath1 ( near - side ) and @xmath2 ( away - side )  @xcite , consistent with fragmentation of jets escaping the dense medium with small energy loss . in the low @xmath0 region ,",
    "the correlation distributions are dominated by a double hump structure around @xmath3 at the away - side ( the cone )  @xcite and a structure elongated along the @xmath4 but centered around @xmath1 ( the ridge )  @xcite , characteristic of a complicated response of the medium to energy deposited by the quenched jets .    in the meanwhile , many theoretical models  @xcite have been proposed to interpret the data .",
    "but to date , a complete and consistent picture accommodating the vast amount data is still missing .",
    "our goal is to provide a brief overview of the dihadron correlation results , with an eye towards the reciprocal relation between jet quenching and medium response , and discuss several insights distilled from the data .",
    "in general the dihadron correlations depend on the @xmath0 of both hadrons in the pair , and the full characterization of their modification patterns have to be studied differentially as function of trigger @xmath0 ( @xmath5 ) and",
    "partner @xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "such a survey study has been carried out recently by the phenix  @xcite and star collaboration  @xcite .",
    "[ fig:1a ] summarizes dihadron @xmath7 distribution in a broad transverse momentum space , which shows many distinctive features appearing at different @xmath0 regions ( indicated by the circles and lines ) .",
    "these features fits well into a simple two - component picture as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1b ] separately for both the near- and away - side : a jet fragmentation component that dominates for @xmath8 gev/@xmath9 , and a medium response component that dominates at @xmath10 gev/@xmath9 .",
    "the rich @xmath0 dependent correlation patterns simply reflect the competition between fragmentation of survived jets and medium response to quenched jets on both the near- and away - side .",
    "the observed patterns are rather complicated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1a ] since 1 ) the medium response and jet fragmentation have very different angular distribution and very different spectral slope , 2 ) the shapes of the medium response are also quite different between the near- and away - side .",
    "a new variable @xmath11 was introduced recently to describe the medium response at low @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 quantify the medium modification of hadron pair yield from the expected yield , in a way similar to @xmath12 for describing the modification of single hadron yield .",
    "the hadron pair yield is proportional to the dijet yield , and in the absence of nuclear effects , it should scale with @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows @xmath11 as a function of pair proxy energy ( @xmath15 ) for the near- ( left panel ) and away - side ( right panel ) .",
    "the star autocorrelation result  @xcite is shown as a single point at @xmath16 gev/@xmath9 .",
    "in contrast to a constant suppression at large @xmath17 , the pair yields are not suppressed or even enhanced at @xmath18 gev/@xmath9 .",
    "this enhancement directly reflects the energy transport that redistribute energy of the quenched jets to low @xmath0 hadrons ( medium response ) .",
    "we would like to point out that @xmath17 is a natural variable for the near - side correlation since it approximates the jet energy , and data show an approximate scaling in @xmath17 .",
    "however , even the data points for the away - side tend to group together , probably because the medium response is a function of jet energy , which increase monotonously with @xmath19 .",
    "the transition from jet fragmentation dominated to medium dominated region in dihadron correlation happens around @xmath20 gev/@xmath9 , a region similar to that for the single particle from soft physics ( hydrodynamics+ recombination ) dominated region to hard physics ( jet ) dominated region .",
    "naturally , we expect the physics important for single particle production should play an important role for the dihadron correlation .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows schematically the @xmath0 dependence of the modifications of the single particle yield ( via @xmath12 ) and hadron pair yield ( via @xmath11 ) .",
    "their @xmath0 dependence trend are quite different , especially at low @xmath0 , which can be explained qualitatively as follows .",
    "even though jet production dominates single particle yield at @xmath21 gev/@xmath9 in @xmath22 collisions , the strong energy loss and collective flow modify the @xmath0 distribution by shifting hard hadrons to lower @xmath0 and pushing soft hadrons to higher @xmath0 .",
    "this reshuffling changes single - hadron and correlated hadron - pair yield , hence the @xmath12 and @xmath11 shape .",
    "indeed , several theoretical models suggest that collective flow and recombination play a significant role in modifying the angular shape , spectra slope and particle composition of the correlated pairs  @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 provides a mean to quantify the contribution of jet fragmentation hadrons or jet induced hadrons in this @xmath0 region .",
    "previously , the modification of dihadron yield is characterized with @xmath23 ( ratio of per - trigger yield between au+au and @xmath22 )  @xcite .",
    "@xmath23 is a good variable at high @xmath0 , since most triggers come from jets and most jets fragment into at most one trigger , such that per - trigger yield ( pty ) is a good representation of per - jet yield .",
    "however at lower @xmath0 region , non - fragmentation triggers from soft production mechanisms or medium response mechanisms become important .",
    "these triggers tend to dilutes the @xmath23 , since they either has no correlation or non - jet like correlation ( such as ridge ) .",
    "[ fig:4 ] illustrate the dilution effects for near - side @xmath4 correlation .",
    "we estimate dilution factor ( @xmath24 ) for 3 - 4 gev/@xmath9 triggers based on their correlations with 5 - 10 gev/@xmath9 hadrons as shown by the inserted panel : requiring 5 - 10 gev/@xmath9 hadrons ensures the pairs are dominated by the jet fragmentation ( left panel of the insert ) , thus deviation of @xmath23 from one for soft triggers reflects the level of dilution ( the red arrow ) .",
    "once the dilution factor is corrected , we subtract out the jet fragmentation contribution and obtain the ridge distribution ( black circles ) .",
    "the estimated ridge contribution is approximately flat , consistent experimental data at large @xmath4 .",
    "however , this dilution effect was not observed in some star analysis  @xcite , which shows that the pty@xmath25 subtracted by the estimated ridge before any dilution correction already equals pty@xmath26 .",
    "in most correlation analyses and model calculations , it was normally assumed that one hadron ( `` trigger '' ) comes from the jet , and the second hadron ( `` partner '' ) comes from either fragmentation or feedback , i.e. only jet - jet and jet - medium pairs are considered . in this picture , the trigger comes from a jet that is biased to the surface , which losses some energy and fragments outside the medium .",
    "the fragments contribute to the near - side jet peak , and the feedback of the lost energy gives rise to the near - side ridge . in parallel",
    ", the away - side jet is quenched as it traverses a longer medium , contributing to the away - side cone .",
    "this picture does not include the medium - medium pairs ( both hadrons come from medium feedback of quenched jets ) .",
    "these pairs could be important at intermediate and low @xmath0 , since each jet can induce more correlated hadrons via jet quenching than via fragmentation .",
    "for example , most medium response models induce correlation by local heating of medium by the jet , such as momentum kick , jet deflection , mach - cone , etc  @xcite , which are very effective in generating large yield of correlated hadron pairs . in addition",
    ", the whole overlap volume contributes to the observed medium - medium pairs , while both jet - jet and jet - medium pairs suffer a strong suppression .",
    "this point is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , which shows the typical geometrical origin for the three types of correlated pairs .",
    "the jet fragmentation contribution is proportional to the number of survived jet ( @xmath27 , i.e. the constant suppression level at large @xmath0 , @xmath28 in most central bin . ) , while the medium response is proportional to the number of quenched jets ( @xmath29 ) . for jet - jet pairs , both hadron",
    "are emitted from the surface ( tangential emission ) ; for jet - medium pairs , the jet hadron is emitted from the surface ( surface emission ) and the other from the whole volume ; for medium - medium pairs , both hadrons are emitted from the whole volume .",
    "the production rate for jet - jet , jet - medium and medium - medium pairs scale approximately with @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "clearly , if @xmath33 , the medium - medium pairs becomes dominant .",
    "recently , several analyses have been carried out to quantify the properties of the near - side ridge and away - side cone structures  @xcite .",
    "the data show very similar properties between the ridge and the cone , i.e. both have similar slope and bulk like particle compositions , and both are important up to 4 gev/@xmath9 .",
    "these similarities suggests that their production mechanisms are connected .",
    "the medium - medium pairs from quenched jets are natural candidates for creating these similarities . because medium - medium pairs come from quenched jets originated deep inside the medium , they contribute to both the near - side and away - side on a equal footing .",
    "the near - side pairs could contain correlations among mach cone particles , and away - side pairs could also contain correlation between the ridge and mach cone particles ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a possible realization ) .",
    "a strong modification of the away - side correlation was also observed at the top sps energy ( @xmath34 gev )  @xcite .",
    "the strong away - side broadening has been used to argue for a similar interpretation ( such as mach cone ) as for the rhic results .",
    "however a quantitative analysis of the energy dependence of the modification patterns ( see fig.[fig:6 ] ) shows that the yield of medium response are quite different between rhic and sps energies .",
    "in fact the near - side yield drop by almost factor of 8 going from 200 gev to 17 gev while the away - side shoulder yield drops by factor of 2 in the same energy range .",
    "but there are little dependence of the yields on @xmath35 in the away - side head region , where the jet fragmentation is important . to quantify the energy dependence of away - side shape",
    ", we calculate the ratio of the yield density in the head region to that in shoulder region , @xmath36  @xcite , in fig.[fig:7]a . the @xmath36 increases with decreasing collision energy , with a ratio slightly above one in sps energy .",
    "this value is comparable with that obtained for rather peripheral ( @xmath37 ) in au+au collisions at 200 gev ( fig.[fig:7]b ) .",
    "these results suggest a much weaker medium response in sps energy ( the ridge almost disappeared and cone strongly suppressed ) than that at rhic , but a similar jet fragmentation contribution , probably related to smaller energy loss and stronger cronin effects at lower energy  @xcite .    cl    &    lastly , it was shown that the mach - cone angle found from the three particle ( 3-p ) correlation ( 1.4 rad ) is significantly larger than the two particle ( 2-p ) correlation analysis ( 1.1 rad ) .",
    "sps also seems to see a 3-p correlation signal  @xcite .",
    "however one should realized that , it is possible that the kinematics of jets contributing to 3-p signal is different from those contributing to the 2-p signal .",
    "it is likely that most jet have multiplicity @xmath38 that the 3-p only samples a small fraction of all jets that contribute to the dihadron correlations .",
    "due to the surface bias and steeply falling parton spectra , the observed high @xmath0 single hadrons and dihadron pairs mainly come from those jets that suffer minimal interaction with the medium .",
    "this energy loss bias limits their usefulness as tomography tools . on the other hand ,",
    "medium responses are directly sensitive to the energy loss and energy dissipation processes used to model the high @xmath0 production .",
    "for example the collisional energy loss would imply that momentum kick dominates the low @xmath0 pairs , the radiative energy loss would favor for the gluon feedback mechanism .",
    "finally , the jet quenching and medium responses are modeled separately in most theoretical calculations . a unified framework , including both jet quenching and medium response , which can describe the full @xmath39 evolution of the jet shape and yield at both near- and away - side is required to understand the details of the parton - medium interactions .",
