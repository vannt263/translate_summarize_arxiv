    "in the theory of quantum information processing we are working with the abstract notion of qubits .",
    "these are two - level quantum systems on which we can perform either individual operations or joint operations , for example two - qubit gates like the cnot operation . with these gates",
    "it is possible to perform an arbitrary operation on a collection of qubits .    in the field quantum communication",
    "we are interested in a photonic implementation of qubits since photons are readily transported through free space or optical fibers . however , the implementation of quantum gates is rather difficult unless it becomes viable to map the photonic qubits onto atomic states which can be more easily processed @xcite . from an experimental point of view",
    "it would be ideal to process the photonic qubits directly without the need to store them . at the level of single photons it appears to be beyond present experimental capabilities to use non - linear effects to perform two - qubit gate operations .",
    "the implementation of qubits by photons opens another way to process the represented quantum information .",
    "since the qubits are now indistinguishable particles , we can use interference by mixing the photonic modes using linear optical elements . ) ) .",
    "in contrast _ active _ linear optical elements mix linearly creation and annihilation operators . ] in general , we are thereby leaving the simple picture of two - level systems , but if we are interested purely in the extraction of information via measurements on some qubits , rather than operations on qubits , then this is not a drawback at all . in this paper",
    "we define a simple class of tools which is designed to capture elements of a simple implementation of general measurement on photonic qubits .",
    "it comprises mixing of optical modes via linear optical elements , the use of auxiliary modes prepared in an arbitrary initial state , the use of conditional dynamics which allows to control the evolution of a subsystem conditioned on the measurement result on some other subsystem and , finally , photon - counting measurements .",
    "the investigation of the measurements implementable with these tools is important because of the direct relation to simple physical implementations .",
    "additionally , it is even very important to investigate the power of subclasses of these tools .",
    "for example , measurements which can be performed with auxiliary modes prepared in the vacuum state and which do not need to make use of conditional dynamics are the easiest measurements one can think of .",
    "it is therefore important to see what basic class of measurements can thus be realized , and how the additional tools , like non - vacuum auxiliary modes or conditional dynamics , extend our capability to perform non - trivial measurements .",
    "an essential measurement in quantum communication is the bell measurement on a product of two separate qubit systems .",
    "this measurement is an essential tool for teleportation @xcite , dense coding @xcite , quantum repeaters @xcite and fault tolerant quantum computing @xcite .",
    "we have shown earlier @xcite that it is not possible to perform a perfect bell measurement with these tools on two qubits represented by the polarization state of a photon .",
    "however , this leaves room for an apparatus which unambiguously discriminates between the four bell states with probability less than one . in the present paper",
    ", we investigate the restricted problem where we make use only of vacuum state auxiliary modes and exclude conditional dynamics .",
    "the aim is to provide an upper bound on the success probability of a bell measurement , using the restricted set of tools .",
    "our result shows that it is possible for equiproble bell states to obtain an unambiguous result in half of the cases only , showing that the early proposed implementations @xcite are indeed optimal within this class .",
    "before we continue we shall describe our tools more precisely .",
    "we restrict our measurement apparatus to linear elements .",
    "this means that the creation operators of the output modes ( @xmath0 ) area linear combination of the input modes ( @xmath1 ) ,    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a unitary matrix .",
    "@xcite have shown that in fact any unitary mapping can be realized using only beamsplitters and phase shifters .",
    "the number of modes is not necessarily limited by the number of modes occupied by the input states : we can couple to auxiliary modes using beam - splitters so that the initial state of input and apparatus is described by the direct product of the hilbert space of the input states and the initial state of the auxiliary modes .",
    "the auxiliary modes can be prepared in an arbitrary state with any number of excitations .",
    "all modes are mapped into output modes , where we place detectors .",
    "detectors with photon number resolution are difficult to realize .",
    "nevertheless , since here we want to concentrate on the real power of linear elements we will work with ideal detectors , so that each measurement outcome corresponds to projection onto photon number states .",
    "here it is important to emphasize that linear optical elements can provide any arbitrary unitary mapping only over creation operators , not over a general input state . only in the case of",
    "one - photon states a unitary map on the creation operators translates into the same map on the the one - photon states .",
    "in fact , making use of this result and of the neumark extension @xcite , we can realize any generalized measurement over one - photon states using the tools described so far .",
    "the last tool introduced here is the ability to perform conditional measurements . with that we mean",
    "that we monitor one selected mode while keeping the other modes in a waiting loop .",
    "then we can perform some linear operation on the remaining modes depending on the outcome of the measurement with all the tools described above .",
    "the general strategy is shown schematically in figure [ fig : generalscheme ] and makes use of electronically switched passive linear optical elements , auxiliary modes with or without excitations and ideal photo - detectors .",
    "a general measurement is described by a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) @xcite given by a collection of positive operators @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "each operator @xmath4 corresponds to one classically distinguishable measurement outcome ( e.g. a given combination of `` clicks '' in the output detectors ) .",
    "the probability @xmath6 for the outcome @xmath7 to occur while the input is being described by density matrix @xmath8 , is given by @xmath9 .",
    "a perfect bell - state analyzer is an apparatus which performs a von neumann projection measurement on a maximally entangled basis .",
    "that is , it is an apparatus for which every measurement outcome is described by a povm element proportional to a projector on one of the four orthogonal bell - states .",
    "it has been proven already @xcite that with the tools described in the previous section it is not possible to construct such an apparatus .    here",
    "we will relax a bit the constraints of the perfect bell - state analyzer by allowing it to fail with some probability .",
    "our non - perfect bell - state analyzer is then defined as a measurement apparatus for which _ some _ povm elements @xmath10 are proportional to a projector onto one of the four orthogonal bell - states .",
    "this means that the events corresponding to each of these povm elements can only be triggered by only one of the input bell - states ( @xmath11 for only one of the four bell state inputs @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "this allows us to rephrase the problem as one of unambiguous state discrimination between the four bell - states .    in this paper",
    "we determine the maximum probability of success for the bell - state analyzer using a restricted , more basic , set of tools ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : restscheme ] ) .",
    "our apparatus consists of a fix array of optical elements ( no conditional measurements allowed ) and the auxiliary modes are initially in the vacuum state ( no extra photons allowed ) . in the remaining of the paper",
    "we will proof that for equiprobable input bell - states the maximal probability of success of this bell state analyzer is @xmath14 . ) giving an optimum success probability of @xmath15 . ]",
    "we can summarize the proof as follows : we introduce the formalism which we will use along the proof .",
    "we prove that all two - photon detection events are a failure ( they do not contribute to the success probability ) .",
    "then we put an upper bound on the probability that an output mode @xmath16 is involved in a successful discrimination event . in order to fix this upper bound",
    "we first show that one mode can participate in the discrimination of at most two bell states . in the end",
    "we obtain the upper bound on the total probability of success by adding the contributions of all modes .",
    "we start by writing up the bell - states encoded in the polarization degree of freedom of two photons with different momentum . in terms of the creation operators of the input modes",
    "they take the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the vacuum state , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) correspond the two polarization modes of the first ( second ) photon .",
    "any two - photon state which enters the apparatus can be defined with a bilinear form , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a @xmath25 symmetric matrix and @xmath26 with the elements @xmath27 being the bosonic creation operators for the input modes .    since the input and output modes are related through a linear transformation ( eq .",
    "[ eq : lincomb ] ) we can write a similar expression for the state in terms of the output modes @xmath0 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30    using the previous relation we can write the output bilinear form @xmath31 corresponding to each of the possible input bell - states ( @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 and from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bella1])-([eq : bella2 ] ) the input bilinear forms are , @xmath34 where @xmath35    we can then rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : uminbellu ] ) as , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the truncated version of @xmath3 obtained by taking only its first four rows ( i.e. @xmath38 ) .",
    "the matrices @xmath39 , which are the first @xmath40 diagonal block of @xmath41 , are unitary .",
    "this property is characteristic of all the maximally entangled states .    from the output bilinear forms",
    "@xmath42 we can read out the contributions of the different input bell states to particular detection events .    we start by studying the two - photon detection events . the probability of having a two - photon detection at mode @xmath16 given the input state @xmath43 is , @xmath44={\\left<0\\right|}c_{i}^2 m^{\\mu^*}_{ii } m^\\mu_{ii }          c_{i}^{\\dagger^2}{\\left|0\\right>}=         \\frac{1}{4}|{\\mathbf \\alpha_{i}}\\cdot w^\\mu\\cdot{\\mathbf \\alpha_{i}}|^2 \\;\\ ;         \\label{eq : prb2}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the @xmath46 column - vector of @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath47 .",
    "that is , the vector @xmath48 gives the linear relation between the output - mode @xmath49 and the modes where we feed the input states ( @xmath50 ) . since the input modes are coupled to the auxiliary modes , the vectors @xmath51 are in general not orthonormal .    in order to identify unambiguously one bell - state through a two - photon detection in mode @xmath16 ,",
    "the probability of this event has to vanish for three of the bell - states . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : prb2 ] ) to impose this condition one can obtain the following solutions for @xmath45 , @xmath52 but it is easy to check that for both solutions the two - photon detection probability vanishes for all bell - states , i.e @xmath53_{i}^{\\mu}=0 $ ] for @xmath54 .",
    "so , a two - photon detection at given output mode @xmath16 can not identify unambiguously one bell state .",
    "after a two photon detection the remaining state is for all the bell states the vacuum state , therefore an event of this type counts as a failure of the bell - state analyzer .",
    "now we can concentrate on the single - photon detection event . from the result in the previous paragraph",
    "we know that these are the only events which can lead to a successful discrimination .",
    "after a single photon detection in mode @xmath16 the remaining photon is in the following conditional state , @xmath55 again , the index @xmath56 stands for the different input bell - states , and @xmath57 is the @xmath58th column vector of @xmath59 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : mout2 ] ) we can write , @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the vectors @xmath62 , corresponding to the four input bell states , are linearly dependent .",
    "this is formally expressed as @xmath63 since they also have the same norm , @xmath64 at least two coefficients @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lindeps ] ) must be non - zero .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lindeps ] ) and the linearity of eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi ] ) and ( [ eq : m1 ] ) it follows that the conditional states after a one - photon detection are linearly dependent as well , @xmath66 with the same coefficients as the @xmath67 dependence .",
    "the overlaps of the conditional states are @xmath68 or , by making use of eq .",
    "( [ eq : m1 ] ) , @xmath69    from the previous equation we can calculate the norm of the conditional states @xmath70 , i.e. the probability of a one - photon detection at mode @xmath16 for each input bell - state , @xmath71_{i}^{\\mu}&= & { \\left<\\phi^{\\mu}_{i}\\right.\\left|\\phi^{\\mu}_{i}\\right>}=\\frac{1}{2 }      ( |{\\mathbf s_{i}^{\\mu}}|^2-      |{\\mathbf\\alpha_{i}}.{\\mathbf s_{i}^{\\mu}}|^2 ) =      \\nonumber \\\\      & = & \\frac{1}{2 }       ( |{\\mathbf \\alpha_{i}}|^2-      |{\\mathbf\\alpha_{i}}.{\\mathbf s_{i}^{\\mu}}|^2 )      \\label{eq : p1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is a well known fact @xcite that one can not discriminate ( not even with a small probability ) states from a set of linearly dependent vectors .",
    "but one should be careful when interpreting this statement .",
    "what is true is that a state can be discriminated from a set of vectors if and only if it is linearly independent of this set of vectors , i.e. it can not be written as a linear combination of the vectors in this set .",
    "but , according to the definition in eq.([eq : lind ] ) it might well be the case that a vector @xmath72 from a linear dependent set is linearly independent from the other vectors of the set .",
    "this would mean that the corresponding factor @xmath73 is zero .",
    "a state with this property can then be discriminated from the rest with a non - zero probability .",
    "the fact that the four conditional states in eq.([eq : lind ] ) are linearly dependent with at least two non - zero coefficients @xmath74 means that the minimum set of linear dependent states contains two states .",
    "consequently the maximum number of states which may be unambiguously discriminated , i.e. which are linearly independent of the others , is two .",
    "let us call @xmath75 and @xmath76 the two different values of the index @xmath56 for which the conditional states are linearly independent .",
    "these correspond to the two bell - states that with some probability may be unambiguously discriminated after a one photon detection in mode @xmath16 . with this result and by assuming that the probability of unambiguous discrimination is one , we can put an upper bound to the _ success probability _ @xmath77 that the detector in mode @xmath16 is involved in the unambiguous discrimination of a bell - state , @xmath78_{i}^{a}+p[1]_{i}^{b } )      \\leq\\frac{1}{4}|{\\mathbf \\alpha_{i}}|^2      \\label{eq : psuc}\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath79 is the a priori probability of the corresponding initial bell - states .",
    "each successful detection event involves single - photon detections in two different modes , say @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "this means that such an event contributes to the corresponding probabilities of success , @xmath82 and @xmath82 of both modes .",
    "this double counting is compensated by a factor @xmath83 when collecting the contributions from all the modes to the total probability of success , @xmath84 here we have made use of , @xmath85    this upper bound can be achieved following the scheme proposed in @xcite , and has been realized experimentally by mattle _ _ et al.__@xcite in the implementation of the quantum dense coding scheme . using a 50/50 beam - splitter and two polarizing beam - splitters it is possible to unambiguously discriminate the states @xmath86 and @xmath87 successfully but",
    "@xmath88 and @xmath89 give the same measurement outcomes .",
    "one therefore obtains a total probability of success of @xmath14 .",
    "since one can transform a bell - state into any other bell - state by local unitary transformations it is clear that one can unambiguously discriminate any other two bell - states .",
    "for example , by inserting a @xmath90 plate before one of the input modes of the previous apparatus one would unambiguously discriminate the states @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "not all linear - optical bell - analyzers are restricted to detect two types of bell states .",
    "for example , there exisist a fix array of beam splitters and phasers which unambiguously discriminates three bell - states , but each of them with probability smaller than one so that @xmath91 .",
    "in this paper we have proven that the maximum probability of success of a bell - state analyzer build with a fix array of linear optical elements is @xmath14 for equiprobable input bell - states .",
    "quantitative results for the case where conditional measurements and auxiliary photons can be used have not been given here , but a recent work by knill , laflamme and milburn @xcite shows that with these tools it is in principle possible to perform bell measurements , among other crucial quantum measurements , with a probability of failure arbitrarily small .",
    "the probability of failure of their schemes decreases as @xmath92 with the number @xmath93 of highly entangled photons used in the auxiliary modes .",

    "we would like to stimulate the study of the capabilities and limitations of quantum information processing with linear elements when qubits are encoded in indistinguishable particles . only very recently some work has been done in this direction .",
    "bouwmeester @xcite has shown a way to implement a scheme which rejects single bit - flip errors using linear - elements and an initial auxiliary ghz state .",
