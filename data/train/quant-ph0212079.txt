    "these ions are transferred into an  accumulator \" trap for the gate operation .",
    "before the gate operation is performed , it may be necessary to sympathetically re - cool the qubit ions with another ion species .",
    "subsequently , these ions are moved to memory locations or other accumulators .",
    "this strategy always maintains a relatively small number of motional modes that must be considered and minimizes the problems of ion / laser - beam addressing using focused laser beams .",
    "such arrays also enable highly parallel processing and ancilla qubit readout in separate trapping regions so that the logical ions are shielded from the scattered laser light .",
    "some of the initial steps towards this scheme have been reported by rowe _",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "the obstacles to building a large - scale quantum computer appear to be technical rather than fundamental .",
    "however since it will be a long time before a useful processor is constructed , it is helpful to have some intermediate goals upon which projections about scaling can be made .",
    "examples goals might be the demonstration of repetitive error correction ( see for example , nielsen and chuang 2000 ) and the realization of gates at the fault - tolerant level of fidelity ( steane 2002 ) .",
