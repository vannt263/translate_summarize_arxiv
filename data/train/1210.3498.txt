    "it is largely accepted that nucleon - induced spallation reactions proceed through a two - stage process : a first stage dominated by hard nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collisions emitting fast particles , followed by the de - excitation of a more or less thermalized remnant , akin to evaporation and/or fission .",
    "the commonly used tools to describe these reactions result from the coupling of an intra - nuclear cascade ( inc ) model for the first stage to an evaporation - fission model for the second stage . there",
    "exist many inc and de - excitation models , differing from each other by the ingredients and by the results . in the last years",
    ", there has been a very strong development of applications involving spallation reactions , including neutron sources for condensed matter and material studies  @xcite , transmutation of nuclear waste  @xcite , simulation of experimental set - ups in nuclear and particle physics  @xcite , production of rare isotopes  @xcite , protection against radiation near accelerators and in space missions  @xcite , interaction of cosmic rays in the atmosphere  @xcite and cancer hadrontherapy  @xcite .",
    "this activity is at the origin of a strong demand for the improvement of the accuracy of the reaction models and for reliable data to benchmark these models efficiently . indeed , in europe , an important effort has been devoted in the last fifteen years to collect and produce high - quality data concerning all emission channels : neutrons , light charged particles ( lcp ) and residues  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , model developers have constantly attempted to improve their models .",
    "we are interested here in the development of the lige inc model ( incl4 ) .",
    "the first standard version ( incl4.2 ) is described extensively in ref .",
    "@xcite . coupled with the abla evaporation / fission model  @xcite ( actually the khsv3p version ) ,",
    "it is able to describe fairly well a large body of experimental data in the 200 mev-2 gev range , namely total reaction cross sections , double differential proton , neutron and pion production cross sections , residue mass and charge spectra , isotopic distributions and , to some extent , recoil energies @xcite .",
    "this was achieved without any parameter adjustment in the inc model and with the use of standard values for the parameters of the abla model .",
    "more precisely , there is no fitting parameter in the incl4.2 model .",
    "the basic nuclear physics parameters , like the radius and the diffuseness of nuclei , are taken from phenomenology and `` technical parameters '' , like those used to evaluate phase space occupation entering the pauli blockers , have been fixed once for all .",
    "in addition the stopping time is generated self - consistently by the model itself . nevertheless , the results obtained with incl4.2 show some systematic shortcomings and/or discrepancies with experimental data .",
    "they have been identified in the frame of the european hindas and nudatra collaborations  @xcite and are shortly presented below .",
    "the most important of these shortcomings is the inability of incl4.2 to produce lcp s ( except protons of course ) . since",
    "the release of the incl4.2 model , a constant effort has been made to palliate its deficiencies .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to set out the present status of the incl4 model , that is designated as incl4.6 .",
    "the various points of improvements are described below .",
    "but , this paper is not a mere update of the incl model .",
    "it highlights at least three innovative points concerning spallation reactions and bearing on @xmath0 production of clusters in the cascade , @xmath1 residue recoil velocities and @xmath2 the behaviour of the model at low energy , respectively .",
    "concerning the first point , a dynamical coalescence model has been implemented to allow the emission of clusters in the cascade stage .",
    "an intermediate version of our model  @xcite , sometimes denoted as incl4.3 , consisting basically of incl4.2 plus the treatment of the emission of light clusters , up to alpha particles , has opened the path to the improvement along this line .",
    "we report here on the continuation of this effort and we show , for the first time , that emission of heavier clusters ( in practice , up to a=8 ) can be explained by dynamical coalescence . concerning point @xmath1 , we show below that we are now able to reproduce average values and standard deviations of the residue velocity distributions .",
    "finally , let us come to point @xmath2 .",
    "it is generally stated that inc models can not be reliable below @xmath3200 mev incident energy , although in some cases where such models are used , they occasionally give surprisingly satisfactory results . in the last years , we have tentatively but systematically improved the model in this energy range .",
    "we considerably improved the model concerning reactions induced by nucleons and by light clusters of nucleons , typically from deuterons to alpha particles , and this for incident energies per nucleon down to a few mev .",
    "our model is now able to produce good total reaction cross sections for both incident nucleons and incident light clusters .",
    "in addition , we show below that we are reproducing reasonably well residue production cross sections for cluster - induced reactions at low energy .",
    "the developments concerning the above - mentioned three points were motivated in part by studies of thick targets , concerning release of volatile elements , such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 isotopes ( point @xmath0 ) , radiation damages ( point @xmath1 ) and radiotoxicity ( point @xmath2 ) .",
    "sometimes , the latter may crucially depend upon secondary reactions induced by light clusters produced in primary collisions  @xcite .",
    "the predictive power of this improved model is considerably better than the one of incl4.2 .",
    "this has been verified on an intermediate version ( named incl4.5 , not very different from incl4.6 , and defined below ) in the course of an intercomparison of spallation codes organized by the iaea  @xcite .",
    "as one may surmise , the passage from incl4.2 to incl4.6 ( even to incl4.5 ) could not have been done entirely in the same spirit of the building of incl4.2 , i. e. resting on known phenomelogy with well determined parameters .",
    "we were forced to introduce less well established features with less solidly determined parameters .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present all the new features that have been introduced in incl4.6 and to give , whenever possible , the physics motivation for these new features .",
    "although a lot of results with incl4.5 are available in ref .",
    "@xcite , perhaps not sufficiently commented or detailed , we present here the most important ones , especially to illustrate the physics aspects of the improvements brought into the model .",
    "the paper is divided as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the incl model with emphasis on the new features of incl4.6 .",
    "section iii is devoted to an extensive comparison with a representative panel of experimental data , for nucleon - induced reactions . in section iv",
    ", we discuss theoretical results for light cluster - induced reactions concerning a few key experiments .",
    "finally , in section v , we critically examine the new features and their effects and we present our conclusion .",
    "the incl4.2 model is extensively described in ref .",
    "it is sufficient here to remind the salient features .",
    "the incl4 model is a time - like intranuclear cascade model . in the initial state ,",
    "all nucleons are prepared in phase space .",
    "target nucleons are given position and momentum at random in agreement with a saxon - woods and a fermi sphere distributions , respectively .",
    "they are moving in a constant potential well , the same for protons and neutrons , describing the nuclear mean field . the incident particle ( nucleon or pion )",
    "is given the appropriate energy and an impact parameter at random .",
    "all nucleons are then set into motion and followed in space - time .",
    "the cascade process involves binary collisions between nucleons and produced pions and delta resonances .",
    "particles can be transmitted through , or reflected on , the surface of the square well potential they feel .",
    "delta resonances decay according to their lifetime .",
    "details on collisions , utilized cross sections , pauli blocking , etc , may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and previous publications cited therein .",
    "we remind that the stopping time of the cascade is determined self - consistently by the model itself .",
    "it can simply be parametrized ( in fm / c ) by @xmath6 for incident nucleons(we denote by @xmath7 and @xmath8 the charge and mass numbers of the target ) .",
    "it is useful to remind some other specific features which may be of importance for the rest of the paper . at the beginning of the cascade process",
    ", the incident nucleon or pion is located with its own impact parameter on the surface of the `` working sphere '' , centered on the target with a radius @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the radius and the diffuseness of the target nucleus density .",
    "particles are moving along straight - line trajectories between collisions inside the working sphere .",
    "they are divided into participants and spectators in the usual sense .",
    "when participants leave the working sphere , they are considered as ejectiles and do not interact any more .",
    "nucleons are moving in a potential well with constant depth and with a radius which is dependent upon their momentum . the potential radius for particles with energy larger than the fermi energy is also taken to be equal to @xmath12 .",
    "pions do not experience any potential .",
    "motivation and details are given in ref .",
    ".    the incl4.2 model can accomodate light clusters ( up to @xmath13-particles ) as projectiles . in this case , the nucleons are given initially position and momentum inside the cluster and the latter is positioned at the beginning in such a way that one of its nucleons is touching the working sphere .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for detail .",
    "we comment a little bit on soft nn collisions .",
    "the latter do not contribute very much to the ejection of particles in the cascade .",
    "there are several arguments based on nuclear transport theory indicating that these collisions should be disregarded , since they induce slow modifications of the particle density distribution , a feature that is supposedly taken into account by the average nuclear potential  @xcite . in incl4.2 ,",
    "soft nn collisions , with c.m .",
    "energy smaller than @xmath14=1925 mev , are simply disregarded .",
    "this cut - off value may seem to be rather large , but one has to realize that low energy nn collisions are largely pauli - blocked in spallation reactions .",
    "lowering the value of @xmath14 does not significantly change the results at high incident energy .",
    "it is no longer the case at low energy , say below @xmath3200 mev , as discussed in ref .",
    "this matter will be re - examined in this paper .",
    "the shortcomings of the incl4.2 model have been identified in various places  @xcite . we just remind them very briefly .",
    "some phenomenological aspects of nuclear physics are neglected .",
    "the model can not accommodate production of clusters in the cascade , i.e. with a kinetic energy definitely larger than the typical evaporation energies , as it can be seen experimentally . concerning the predictive power of the model , several deficiencies can be noted .",
    "pion production is generally overestimated .",
    "quasi - elastic peaks in ( @xmath15 ) reactions are generally too narrow and sometimes underestimated .",
    "finally , reaction cross sections are severely underpredicted below @xmath3100 mev .",
    "residue production cross sections are sometimes unsatisfactorily reproduced , especially for residues close to the target . for matter of convenience , we separate below the new features of the incl4.6 model into those which are included in the intermediate incl4.5 version and those which are posterior to this version .        _",
    "a. isospin and energy - dependent potential",
    "well for the nucleons_. the depth of the potential well felt by the nucleons is dependent upon the energy of the nucleons and is not the same for protons and neutrons .",
    "the energy dependence is taken from the phenomenology of the real part of the optical - model potential  @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the potential depth decreases regularly with increasing energy , from ordinary values at the fermi level to zero at roughly 200 mev .",
    "the isospin dependence is such that the neutron and proton fermi levels have the same energy . for more detail , see ref .",
    "the influence of this modification is relatively small , except for special quantities , like the production cross sections for isotopes with an extra unit of charge compared to the target  @xcite .    _",
    "b. average potential for pions_. an average isospin - dependent potential well , of the lane type  @xcite , is introduced for pions , as well as reflection and/or transmission at the border of this potential .",
    "the depth of the potential has been taken , as far as possible , from the phenomenology of the real part of the pion - nucleus optical potential ( dispersive effects due to the strong imaginary part have to be removed ) .",
    "this depth amounts to 22 mev for @xmath16 s and 38 mev for @xmath17 s on a @xmath18 target .",
    "the radius of the potential is taken as @xmath19 , in rough accordance with phenomenology .",
    "this modification and its effect are presented in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in general",
    ", it reduces the pion production cross section , mitigating so the overestimate by incl4.2 , as illustrated below by fig .",

    "c. deflection of charged particles in the coulomb field_. once an impact parameter is selected for the incident nucleon , the cascade process is initiated with this nucleon located at the intersection of the `` external '' coulomb trajectory ( corresponding asymptotically to the specific impact parameter ) with the `` working sphere '' ( see above ) .",
    "the same procedure is used to connect the direction of an outgoing particle at the nuclear periphery and its asymptotic direction .",
    "an improvement of the incl4.2 model , concerning this feature , had been already proposed in ref .",
    "the implementation of this feature in incl4.5 is somehow different , although the basic idea is the same : an outgoing nucleon crossing the nuclear periphery is supposed to be able to carry along other nucleons to form a cluster , provided the involved nucleons are lying sufficiently near each other in phase space .",
    "we first describe the present implementation in incl4.5 and then comment upon the difference with the work of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an outgoing nucleon arriving at the surface of the `` working sphere '' , whether or not it has made collisions earlier , is selected as a possible leading nucleon for cluster emission , provided its energy is larger than the threshold energy , otherwise it is reflected .",
    "potential clusters are then constructed .",
    "the leading nucleon is drawn on its ( straight ) line of motion back to a radial distance @xmath20 @xmath10 being the half density radius , and clusters are built by searching nucleons which are sufficiently close in phase space ( @xmath21 s are excluded ) , the nucleon is moved back to the minimum distance of approach of the center of the nucleus . ] .",
    "clusters of increasing sizes are built successively .",
    "all potential clusters up to a maximum size @xmath22 are considered .",

    "the value of @xmath30 is discussed below .",
    "the test on jacobian coordinates is preferred to the usual test on the relative coordinates @xmath31 , @xmath32 for any pair ( @xmath33 ) of particles , because it disfavours exotic shapes ( such as spaghetti ) of the clusters .",

    "clusters up to @xmath348 are considered .",
    "extending @xmath22 beyond this value may change the yields .",
    "we have checked that problems of convergence of the procedure manifest themselves by a slight excess of the yield for clusters with a mass number equal to @xmath22 , as indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite , so that in practice numerically stable results are obtained for clusters of mass up to 7 , and that the predicted yield for production of mass 8 can be considered as an upper bound .",

    "the cluster with the minimum value of @xmath38 is selected .",

    "the introduction of this quantity is largely phenomenological and is solely justified by the relative success of the model .",

    "<S> the new version ( incl4.6 ) of the lige intranuclear cascade ( inc ) model for the description of spallation reactions is presented in detail . compared to the standard version ( incl4.2 ) , it incorporates several new features , the most important of which are : _ ( i ) _ the inclusion of cluster production through a dynamical phase space coalescence model , _ </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) _ the coulomb deflection for entering and outgoing charged particles , _ ( iii ) _ the improvement of the treatment of pauli blocking and of soft collisions , _ </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) _ the introduction of experimental threshold values for the emission of particles , _ </S>",
    "<S> ( v ) _ the improvement of pion dynamics , _ ( vi ) _ a detailed procedure for the treatment of light - cluster induced reactions taking care of the effects of binding energy of the nucleons inside the incident cluster and of the possible fusion reaction at low energy . </S>",
    "<S> performances of the new model concerning nucleon - induced reactions are illustrated by a comparison with experimental data covering total reaction cross - sections , neutron , proton , pion and composite double differential cross - sections , neutron multiplicities , residue mass and charge distributions , and residue recoil velocity distributions . </S>",
    "<S> whenever necessary , the incl4.6 model is coupled to the abla07 de - excitation model and the respective merits of the two models are then tentatively disentangled . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement is generally obtained in the 200 mev-2 gev range . below 200 mev and down to a few tens of mev , </S>",
    "<S> the total reaction cross section is well reproduced and differential cross sections are reasonably well described . </S>",
    "<S> the model is also tested for light - ion induced reactions at low energy , below 100 mev incident energy per nucleon . beyond presenting the update of the incl4.2 model , attention has been paid to applications of the new model to three topics for which some particular aspects are discussed for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the first topic is the production of clusters heavier than alpha particle . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the energy spectra of these produced clusters are consistent with coalescence . </S>",
    "<S> the second topic regards the longitudinal residue recoil velocity and its fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> excellent results are obtained for these quantities . </S>",
    "<S> it addition , it is shown that the distributions of these quantities display typical random - walk characterics , at least for not too large mass losses . </S>",
    "<S> they are interpreted as a direct consequence of the independence of successive binary collisions occurring during the cascade process . </S>",
    "<S> the last topic concerns the total reaction cross section and the residue production cross sections for low energy incident light ions . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that our new model can give a rather satisfactory account of these cross sections , offering so an alternative to fusion models and the advantage of a single model for the progressive change from fusion to pre - equilibrium mechanisms .    </S>"
