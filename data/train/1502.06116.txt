    "the cosmic gamma  ray background is diffuse and its origin is diverse and remains partly unknown at various energy ranges . on the low energy side , from x ",
    "ray energies up to around 0.3 mev , agns and seyfert galaxies provide most of the emission ( madau et al . 1994 ; ueda et al . 2003 ) . at @xmath4 0.3 mev ,",
    "the spectrum of agns and seyfert galaxies sharply cuts off . from 50 mev to the gev range , blazars seem to be responsible for the observed flux ( zdziarski 1996 ; sreekumar et al . 1998 ) .",
    "however , the latest results from _ fermi _ , in the gev range , which show a higher gamma  ray background at gev energies than previous results from egret , have called into question the former attribution to blazars as the main source ( see discussions in lacki , horiuchi & beacom 2014 ) .",
    "nevertheless , recent examinations of this issue find that at energies @xmath5 100 mev , blazars account for @xmath250% of the background , while the other half is contributed by star  forming galaxies and radio galaxies ( ajello et al .",
    "2015 ; di mauro & donato 2015 ) .",
    "the measurements in the mev range have been provided by various space missions .",
    "the first exploration of the region between 1 and 5 mev was made by the apollo 15/16 missions ( trombka et al .",
    "the reanalysis of the apollo data , the measurements from heao  a4 ( kinzer et al .",
    "1997 ) , the solar maximum mission ( watanabe et al . 1999a ) , and comptel ( kappadath et al . 1996 ; weidenspointner 2000 ) provided the basic empirical results on the diffuse gamma  ray background , in the range from 100 kev to 10 mev .",
    "the slope of the emission spectrum exhibits a steep decrease with increasing energy , from a few hundred kev to 10 mev , changing to a flatter slope around 10 mev and beyond , revealing the need of an intense extragalactic source in the mev window . in this range of energies ,",
    "the discussion of the origin of the background was revived at the beginning of the xxist century and continued up to the present time ( see lacki , horiuchi & beacom 2014 )",
    ".    much of the current discussion centers on the possibility that type ia supernovae are able to produce the observed flux in the 0.33 mev range , filling the gap between seyferts and blazars .",
    "this possibility was first suggested by clayton and silk ( 1969 ) , and further studied by the et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and watanabe et al .",
    "( 1999b ) ( hereafter w99b ) .",
    "at those times , there were no empirical rates of sne ia available , in particular the function @xmath6 , was not measured at the required high redshifts .",
    "therefore , the authors had to estimate fluxes on the basis of the better known star formation rates in galaxies and a convolution with an assumed delay time distribution between the birth of the progenitor binary systems and the explosions . depending on the delay time since birth of the system , the sne ia rate could be either too low or just right , to account for the measured level of the gamma ",
    "ray background ( w99b ) .",
    "lapuente , cass & vangioni  flam ( 2001 ) ( hereafter rcv01 ) performed a study of the sne ia contribution in the mev region , by considering a wide range of star formation rates @xmath7 in galaxies and different efficiencies in the production of sne ia , for each star formation rate .",
    "ruiz - lapuente ( 2001 ) found that not much under 1000 m@xmath8 going into star formation gives rise to one sn ia ( 720 @xmath9 250 m@xmath8 produce 1 snia ) .",
    "the efficiency , defined as @xmath10 was 1.41 @xmath9 0.35 10 @xmath11 m@xmath8@xmath12 @xmath13 . in that work , they found that the delay time between star formation and supernova explosion could shift the estimate up or down , but that most star formation histories would average out the effect , since the distribution of sne ia delay times appeared to be broad .",
    "the result of this study was that sne ia yield a background emission , in the mev range , that can explain the extragalactic emission measured by comptel and smm .",
    "just shortly afterwards , the topic was addressed by other authors ( iwabuchi & kumagai 2001 ; ahn , komatsu & hflich 2005 hereafter akh05 ; strigari et al .",
    "2005 ) , and was more recently considered again by horiuchi & beacom ( 2010 , hereafter hb2010 ) .",
    "the latter authors obtained a range of possibilities concerning the sn ia contribution , but found that they are in general not able to account for the mev background .",
    "the earlier `` negative '' results can be traced to the first high@xmath14 sne ia rates obtained by dahlen et al .",
    "( 2004 , hereafter d04 ) which peak at a smaller @xmath14 than current rates ( okumura et al . 2014 ; rodney et al . 2014 ; graur et al .",
    "however , hb2010 do not use the dahlen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) rates , but a common fit to data availablle up to 2010 .",
    "these rates will be compared with most recent measurements .    both w99b and rcv01 ( see also similar findings by the et al .",
    "1993 and by zdziarski 1996 ) had concluded that there was room for sne ia to account for the unexplained mev background .",
    "they did so by integrating the full gamma - ray spectrum emerging from sn ia models during the early period of significant production by radioactive decay . in this context one",
    "includes the production of gamma - ray photons as well as their transport in the expanding ejecta .",
    "akh05 take a snia rate ( from d04 ) that is one order of magnitude smaller than the one adopted by w99b .",
    "this may explain most of the discrepancy in the results .",
    "hb2010 calculations take the continuum plus line @xmath0ray spectra from the w7fm model ( fully mixed w7 model ) shown in w99b and the 5p0z22.23 model shown in akh05 ( 2005 ) ( private communication ) .",
    "we find agreement with their results when using the same sne ia rates as hb2010 did .    one interesting feature of the sne ia contribution , which is shared by the calculations presented in w99b , rcv01 , akh05 , hb2010 is that the predicted sne ia gamma ",
    "ray background contribution has a spectral shape ( power law in energy ) that runs parallel to the observed fluxes up to 3 mev .",
    "this match in slope is one of the primary reasons for considering sn ia as a significant contributor , and to focus on the disagreement with the flux normalization .    due to the recent appreciation of sn ia as cosmological probes ,",
    "a significant increase in dedicated observational programs produced a greatly improved knowledge of their rates , for a wide range of redshifts ( some of the most recent contributions were mentioned above ) .",
    "we also know well the cosmological parameters required for the calculation ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) . moreover ,",
    "for the first time , a nearby sn ia ( sn 2014j ) has been detected in the mev range ( with integral : churazov et al .",
    "2014 ; diehl et al .",
    "the latter authors account for the gamma  ray data with a white dwarf explosion having a small amount of @xmath18ni at the outskirts and around 0.5 @xmath19 in the innermost core .",
    "this model is similar to those used in the previous calculations of the gamma  ray background ( and also to those that will be used here ) .",
    "thus , we now have a firmed up grasp of the gamma  ray flux emitted by sne ia .",
    "these developments led us to once more calculate the gamma  ray background from sne ia , now based on improved knowledge of the theoretical ingredients .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we discuss the different numerical methods used to compute the gamma ",
    "ray fluxes from given sne ia models .",

    "we present an update of the sne ia rates at various @xmath14 and show the interpolations used for the background calculations . in section 5 , we explain the gamma  ray background formulation and present the results .",
    "section 6 discusses the results and the final section contains our conclusions .",
    "in order to derive the emergent spectrum predicted by supernova models , we use the monte carlo code described in burrows & the ( 1990 ) and the , burrows & bussard ( 1990 ) , modified to include bremsstrahlung x  ray production and the iron fluorescence line at @xmath26.4 kev ( clayton & the 1991 ; the , bridgman & clayton 1994 ) .",

    "a relevant aspect of the uncertainties in determining rates at high @xmath14 ( @xmath67 ) is that the detection efficiency decreases rapidly with redshift , as observed bands shift farther into the rest  frame uv spectrum , where sn ia emission is scarce ( see the spectra shown in riess et al .",
    "this causes the uncertainties to become very large at z @xmath2 1.6 ( barbary et al . 2012 ) .",

    "they make up to about 60% of all sn ia explosions ( see ruiz  lapuente 2014 , for a review ) .",

    "2013 ) , though a lower estimate is found in white et al .",
    "those sne ia produce smaller amounts of @xmath18ni , thus making an even smaller contribution to the background ( although their smaller ejecta mass increases the gamma ",

    "ray fluxes larger would be to adopt models brighter in gamma ",
    "rays than w7 or w7fm ( both models giving about the same average contribution over 600 days after explosion ) ; some sne ia models can give twice as many escaping gamma  rays .",
