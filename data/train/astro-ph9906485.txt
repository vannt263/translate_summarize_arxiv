    "i am not aware of any astrophysical plasma in which the magnetic field is clearly unimportant .",
    "space plasmas , which we can observe _ in situ _ , are commonly magnetized ; in some cases the magnetic field and associated currents dominate the plasma dynamics .",
    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) in our galaxy is magnetized , at approximately an equipartion level . the diffuse plasma in radio galaxies is obviously magnetized , probably at dynamically important levels .",
    "until recently , magnetic fields have generally been ignored in dynamical models of the intracluster plasma medium ( icm ) . however , this is changing as data accumulates  and the discussion at this conference is a case in point .",
    "it seems very likely that the icm is magnetized in every cluster  just as we believe the interstellar medium ( ism ) is magnetized in every galaxy .",
    "i suspect the dynamics of the magnetized icm are in many ways similar to the dynamics of the magnetized ism .",
    "the magnetized plasmas in both systems are probably subject to strong effects of cluster , or galactic , weather ( _ e.g. _ , binney 1998 , zweibel & heiles 1997 ) .",
    "that is , seed fields are probably provided to the ism by stellar ejecta ; and to the icm by ejecta from both active and `` normal '' galaxies ( kronberg _ et al _ 1999 , vlk & aronyan 1999 ) .",
    "the seed fields are enhanced and shaped by turbulence , flows and dissipation , a complex process which results in the fields we see at present .    up to now observational",
    "work on cluster fields has mainly been aimed at detection : can we find any evidence of magnetic fields in any clusters ?",
    "the answer to that seems clearly to be `` yes '' , as this meeting has demonstrated .",
    "it may be time to change our focus .",
    "we know that the icm is magnetized ; we should concentrate now exploring the cluster field in more detail , both observationally and theoretically . in this paper",
    "i will try to convey a rather personal impression of what we know about magnetized plasmas from other sources ( laboratory and space data , simulations , theory ) , and to consider how this information can be used to understand magnetic fields in clusters .",
    "we have two ways to detect magnetic fields in the cluster plasma",
    ". we can detect diffuse synchrotron emission ( from radio haloes and relics ) , or we can detect faraday rotation from individual radio galaxies , either behind the cluster or embedded in it .",
    "we have three possible observational approaches to measuring the magnetic field in a cluster of galaxies .",
    "* radio haloes and relics*. some clusters show diffuse synchrotron emission which is associated with the icm rather than with discrete radio galaxies within the clusters ( _ e.g. _ feretti & giovannini 1996 , feretti 1999 ) .",
    "this emission can exist throughout the cluster ( haloes ) , or be peripheral ( relics ) . in either case , this is direct evidence of intracluster b fields .",
    "minimum - energy or minimum - pressure arguments , sometimes combined with x - ray inverse compton detections or limits , suggest @xmath0 g is typical on large scales ( comparable to the size of the cluster core , or the cluster itself ) .",
    "* faraday rotation of background sources*. comparison of faraday signals from cluster and non - cluster sources allows a statistical test of cluster magnetic fields .",
    "current studies do show an excess rotation measure from sources in or behind rich clusters ( kim _ et al _ 1991 , clarke 1999 ) .",
    "modelling this data in terms of a `` typical '' icm density and scale , and a cell size @xmath1 kpc , again suggests a microgauss - level field is typical of the cluster on moderate to large scales .",
    "* faraday rotation of embedded sources*. another approach uses high - resolution images of radio sources within the cluster . as",
    "this is the closest to my own research , i will say a bit more about it .",
    "radio imaging gives us our only evidence on the structure of the magnetic field .",
    "most studies have been of cluster - center sources , but a few studies of non - central sources now exist ( _ e.g. _ feretti _ et al _ 1999 ) . in eilek & owen ( 1999 ) ,",
    "we present new faraday data on two large , tailed radio sources ( 3c75 , 3c465 ) in the centers of two clusters ( a400 , a2634 respectively ) which have only weak cooling cores .",
    "we also collect published results of other imaged faraday data on cluster - center sources ( which have studied smaller radio sources in strong cooling cores ) .",
    "these results are summarized in table 1 , which lists the radio source , its radial extent , the characteristic scale of its measured rotation measure , the mass accretion rate inferred from simple cooling - flow analysis , the mean magnetic field along the line of sight inferred from faraday data , and the ratio of magnetic pressure to gas pressure .",
    "this data allows us to make a general statement : the magnetic field is dynamically significant in the central regions of these clusters .",
    "the typical central field strength @xmath2 g . comparison to pressures derived from x - ray data shows that @xmath3 is typical for the cluster - center sample .",
    "we can also use the images to estimate coherence lengths for the rotation measure .",
    "the general trend we see , is that cthe luster - core rotation measure has a characteristic length scale @xmath4 10 kpc .",
    "this is our only direct information so far on the coherence length of the cluster field .",

    "both the radio haloes and the faraday rotation of background sources are more or less consistent with a microgauss level field existing throughout most clusters .",
    "a field at this level is not dynamically important at typical icm densities and temperatures .",
    "we also know , however , that stronger fields ( tens of @xmath11 g ) exist in cluster centers , where we detect them in front of central radio galaxies .",
    "these fields are dynamically important .",
    "there are also hints of stronger fields associated with non - central radio galaxies .",
    "we do not yet know whether these stronger fields are typical of the diffuse icm in all clusters , or whether they are amplified by energy input from the radio galaxies .",
    "what is the next step ?",
    "we would like to use these observations to answer fundamental questions .",
    "what is the strength and structure of the field ? what is its role in , and relation to , the dynamics of the cluster gas ?",
    "the observations we can make are both tantalizing and frustrating . they can not answer these qustions directly , but can provide important clues .",
    "we should look to other information that we have on magnetized plasmas .",
    "one is often tempted to interpret an observation in terms of the simplest possible model . for the case of magnetic fields ,",
    "the very simplest model is a uniform field throught the cluster ; the next simplest is the old idea of random , gaussian `` cells '' of field .",
    "we should be very cautious here .",
    "these seems to be no plasma ( whether astrophysical or simulated ) in which the field is truly uniform , nor in which the field structure can be described by simple , space - filling cells .",
    "the magnetic field in a magnetized plasma is more likely to be bunched into elongated , high - field regions : we can call these `` filaments '' or `` flux ropes '' .",
    "the evidence comes from several areas .",
    "* simulations of mhd turbulence * find that intermittency is common : the magnetic field is organized into localized , often elongated , high - field regions _",
    "e.g. _ , menguzzi _ et al _ 1981 , nordlund _ et al _ 1992 , miller _ etal _ 1996 , kinney _",
    "et al _ 1995 ) .",
    "this appears similar to the small - scale vortex intermittency seen in hydrodynamical turbulence ; vorticity in fluid flows sometimes behaves similarly to magnetic fields in mhd flows .",
    "the characteristic intermittency scale is thought to be similar to the turbulent dissipation scale ( but this conculsion may still be sensitive to numerical resolution ) .",
    "* space plasma data * is measured _ in situ_. these measurements again find direct evidence that the field is often bunched into flux ropes .",
    "these are apparent in the flux transfer events that are part of patchy reconnection at planetary magnetopauses , and they have been detected in interplanetary space , associated with coronal mass ejections .",
    "( the compilation edited by russell  1990 is a good source of references to this area . ) in addition , optical and x - ray images of the sun make it clear that solar plasma is filamented ; this is almost certainly due to magnetic fields .    *",
    "the magnetized ism * displays rich substructure and filamentation .",
    "dramatic examples include the filamentation apparent in hi images ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) , or recent radio images of the galactic center ( lang _ et al _ 1999 ) .",
    "once again , we do not have direct evidence that the filaments are magnetically created , but such seems very likely to be the case .",
    "* extragalactic radio sources * commonly show filamentation in their synchrotron emission .",
    "a particularly beautiful example is the new image of the m87 halo ( owen , eilek & kassim 1999 , also owen 1999 ) .",
    "these are almost certainly high - field regions ; polarization data when available shows that such filaments are aligned with the magnetic field .",
    "inhomogeneous fields affect `` simple '' interpretation of observations in several ways ; we must be cautions .",
    "* minimum pressure or equipartion * estimates are well known to be sensitive to the inhomogeneity of the source . in following the usual applications",
    "( for instance , that of pacholczyk 1970 ) , we must remember that two filling factors are needed .",
    "one is the fraction of the volume filled by relativistic particles , which may of course be less than unity .",
    "the second is the fraction of the volume filled by relativistic particles that is _ also _ filled with magnetic field ( denoted by @xmath13 in the standard notation ) .",
    "incomplete volume filling leads to a _ higher _ magnetic field value , derived from these standard arguments , than would be the case for a homogeneous source .",
    "interpretation of * inverse compton * ( ic ) x - ray detections or limits is also sensitive to the degree of mixing of the relativistic electrons and the magnetic field .",
    "incomplete mixing ( such as magnetic filamentation ) will lead to a lower ratio of synchrotron to ic emission than would apply to a homogeneous source .",
    "conversely , an observation of a fixed ic / synchrotron ratio requires a higher magnetic field value if the source is incompletely filled .    *",
    "particle aging * due to synchrotron losses is also sensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneity .",
    "particles lose energy more rapidly , and radiate at higher frequencies , in a strong field .",
    "one consequence of this is that the high - frequency decay of the synchrotron spectrum can be dramatically slowed down if the particles spend much of the time in weak - field regions ( eilek , melrose & walker 1997 ) . applied to interpretation of data , one must be aware that radio sources can be much older than they look",
    ".    finally , interpretation of * synchrotron spectra * must be done with care if the magnetic field is inhomogeneous .",
    "the usual analysis assumes a uniform field , and interprets the photon spectrum as a direct measure of the particle energy distribution . in reality , however , the photon spectrum is a convolution of the field and particle distributions .",
    "one example is that a power - law distribution of magnetic field strength , combined with a peaked particle energy distribution , can produce a power - law photon spectrum ( eilek & arendt 1996 ) .",
    "it is quite likely that observed spectra are telling us as much about the field distribution as about the particles .",
    "what can we say about the small - scale structure of these magnetic filaments ?",
    "i think our best evidence comes from space plasmas , where _ in situ _ field measurements are possible .",
    "the filaments tend to be structured as a _ flux rope_. that is , a twisted ( helical ) magnetic field structure , in which the field lies along the axis in the center of the tube , and becomes increasingly helical going away from the axis .",
    "such flux ropes can be confined by external pressure , or can be partly or fully self - confining , depending on the exact structure of the field .",
    "the latter is particularly nice , as it allows strong fields to be self - organized into filamentary structures without the need for external pressure confinement .    what is the origin of these structures ?",
    "fluid flow offers analogs .",
    "consider is a tornado : a strong vortex line which forms due to the combination of shear and convergeance in the local atmosphere .",
    "as vorticity and magnetic field are often useful analogs of each other , one would expect magnetic flux ropes to arise from similarly favorable flow fields .",
    "( one mhd example might be the solar convective zone , where converging flows accumulate the magnetic field into strong , localized , low - density filaments .",
    "add a bit of circulation and one can imagine a twisted flux rope arising . )",
    "one can also look to space plasma analogs .",
    "flux rope formation associated with flux transfer events is thought to be due to plasma instabilities , particularly reconnection , again in the presence of some twist .",
    "tearing instabilities lead to magnetic island formation in two - dimensional problems ( such as the neutral sheet in a reconnection situation ) , and thus connect to helical flux ropes in three dimensions .",
    "in other domains , mhd simulations find that passive magnetic fields ( weak compared to flow energy density ) in sheared flows collect into filaments ( such as the radio galaxy simulations of clarke 1996 ) .",
    "laboratory evidence shows that strong fields ( compared to plasma energy densities ) can organize themselves into force - free structures ( _ e.g. _ taylor 1986 ) ; in cylindrical geometry these have the general flux - rope structure described above .",
    "thus , it seems that we can generally think of magnetic fields as filamented , probably on a ranges of scales , whether the field is weak or strong .",
    "the existence of small - scale filaments does not preclude an organized large - scale structure .",
    "an obvious example is the sun : the surface field is strongly inhomogeneous and filamented , and yet shows a simple dipolar structure when measured on larger scales .",
    "what can we say about the large - scale structure of the cluster field ?",
    "we have little direct information as yet .",
    "we know that the magnitude of the rotation measure seems to drop going away from cluster center ; this is apparent in the statistical data of clarke ( 1999 ) , and also in the two large - scale sources measured by eilek & owen ( 1999 ) .",
    "we also know that large - scale radio haloes have a finite size , which is no larger than the cluster size",
    ".    both of these observations suggest that the field strength decreases with distance from the cluster center ( except possibly clusters with in offset radio relics , which may have an enhanced magnetic field near their periphery ) .",
    "however , both observations must be interpreted with care .",
    "the observed decay of rotation measure must be due in part to the decrease of gas density , as well as to the field structure .",
    "similarly , the structure of a radio halo is determined by the relativistic particle density as well as the field strength .",
    "i am not aware of any work at this point which can separate out the effects of the field and the particles in these observations .",
    "we can make one general statement : cluster fields must involve a dynamo . for our purposes , i define a dynamo ( interpreted loosely ) as anything that plasma flows can do to a magnetic field .",
    "the most common application involves the inductive enhancement of a weak seed field to interesting levels .",
    "( this comes from the @xmath14 term in the induction equation , given for instance in garasi & eilek 1999 ) as a general rule , flows can amplify a field up to a state of dynamic balance , @xmath15 .",
    "however , the rate of growth and the final field level depend on details of the flow field , particularly turbulent and dissipative effects .",
    "in addition , some situations ( such as flux ropes in the sun ) result in the field on small scales coming into balance with the static pressure : @xmath16 .",
    "this results in a higher field that that produced by the usual dynamic balance estimate , if the flows controlling the dynamo are subsonic .",
    "figure 1 illustrates some of the possible branch points in turbulent and/or advective dynamos .    what can dynamo theory tell us about the cluster field ?",
    "we can , in principle , inquire about the strength and structure of the field .",
    "several authors have suggested that turbulent dynamos maintain a low level magnetic field throughout the cluster ( _ e.g. _ ruzmaikin _ et al _ 1989 , goldman & rephaeli 1991 , de young 1992 ) .",
    "these models generally address only the local field strength ( from the energy balance relation given above ) , and assume the field is disordered with small - scale tangling .",
    "the field strength depends directly on the turbulent velocity assumed : @xmath17km / s gives @xmath18 g if the plasma density is @xmath19@xmath20 .    an important related question is what drives the turbulence that these models require to maintain the field .",
    "earlier work argued that galaxy driving in a relaxed cluster could maintain interesting levels of turbulence , and magnetic field , throughout the cluster .",
    "however , more recent work disagrees .",
    "there now seems to be a general agreement that galaxy driving can not maintain the strong turbulence , ( probably transonic ; _",
    "baum 1992 , or keel _ et al _ 1996 ) and strong magnetic fields , seen in cluster cores .",
    "it may not even be able to maintain a microgauss level field .",
    "i have done calculations for turbulent driving in a rich , coma - type cluster , and find turbulent velocities of a few tens of km / s , which maintain fields at only a fraction of a microgauss .",
    "this difficulty leaves one with two options .",
    "one can argue that the stronger fields discussed at this meeting are atypical , perhaps maintained only locally by energy input from an embedded radio galaxy .",
    "alternatively , ongoing evolution of the cluster gravitational potential ( otherwise known as cluster mergers ) can provide a stronger energy input , in principle maintaining stronger turbulent and field levels .",
    "norman & bryan ( 1998 ) indeed found turbulent velocities between 1/4 and 1/2 of the virial velocity were maintained for significant times in one set of merger simulations .",
    "less work has been done on the spatial structure of the magnetic field .",
    "several authors have noted that the compression associated with convergent cooling flows will amplify an initial seed field towards the cluster center . for a field which remains purely turbulent and simply advected",
    ", one would expect @xmath21 ( this would be the case if fluid turbulence or reconnection maintained a locally turbulent field during the inflow ) .",
    "an alternative picture is that of soker & sarazin ( 1990 ) , who proposed that the inflow stretches an initally disordered field radially .",
    "they find the field varies as @xmath22 in this case .",
    "such arguments also assume a weak , passive field ; when the field becomes strong it will affect the flow and break these scaling laws .",
    "numerical simulations ( such as dolag , bartlemann & lesch 1999 , garasi & eilek 1999 , roettinger 1999 ) will be required to determine the final answer here .",
    "what field structure td simple turbulent dynamo models predict ?",
    "one expects that the turbulently maintained field will be strong where the turbulence in strong .",
    "locally strong turbulence might be the reason why some haloes , or relics , do not share the symmetry of the cluster in which they sit .",
    "i have not seen this addressed in published work ; again , ongoing numerical simulations have the potential to address this .",
    "the behavior of turbulent dynamos has the potential to be much richer than these simple arguments .",
    "in particular , laboratory plasmas show a capacity for _ self - organization_. if the system has the proper initial asymmetry ( helicity ) , the magnetic field can undergo a `` relaxation '' process to a final state which displays more order on large scales than the initial state had ( taylor , 1986 ) .",
    "i have considered one possible final state for clusters , namely , nested toroidal flux tubes .",
    "this solution predicts that the magnetic field increases outward from a central minimum , and then decays as @xmath23 .",
    "it is not yet clear whether these formal solutions ( derived from laboratory considerations ) apply to clusters which are still in a non - steady state .",
    "we must keep in mind , however , that dynamo effects in clusters may be more complex than has been considered so far .",
    "to summarize : the observations suggest that microgauss fields extend throughout the cluster plasma .",
    "larger fields exist around embedded radio sources ; it is not yet clear if they are representative of the general diffuse icm .",
    "what are the consequences of a such magnetic fields for the larger questions about the clusters",
    "?      there has been quite a lot of discussion in the literature regarding the effect of magnetic fields on transport processes in the icm .",
    "this has come up most particularly in regard to thermal conduction ( or its suppression ) in cooling - flow models ; and it is also relevant to questions of relativistic particle diffusion in radio haloes .",
    "the detailed workings of particle transport depend on the detailed structure of the magnetic field , particularly on small scales .",
    "the literature tends to split into two camps : those working with a spectral representation of the turbulent magnetic field ( , jokipii 1966 ) , and those working with a chaotic representation ( , chandran & cowley 1998 ) .",
    "the essence of both approaches involves determining a characteristic , coherence , length for the turbulent field ( if , indeed , one exists )",
    ". it may be here that observations ( such as the structure of faraday rotation images ) can make connection with the theory .",
    "a significant magnetic field in the center of the cluster will of course affect the hydrostatic balance , and thus the structure , of the icm . in a ( quasi ) static situation",
    "the field can provide an important part of the pressure support",
    ". this may be part of the answer to the discrepancy found between cluster masses determined from gravitational lensing , and from x - ray imaging ( miralda - escud & babul , 1995 ; loeb & mao 1994 ) .",
    "just how general this result is does not seem clear yet , as only a few clusters have been so analyzed both in x - rays and with lensing .",
    "it is also worth noting that x - ray mass determinations will also be misleading if the icm is itself dynamic rather than in hydrostatic equilibrium ( , squires , 1996 ) .",
    "the theoretical approach to this question will probably lean heavily on numerical simulations of cluster evolution ( , garasi & eilek 1999 , roettiger 1999 ) .",
    "a significant central magnetic field will also impact the dynamics of the icm .",
    "in general , a magnetic field providing pressure support to gas at the bottom of a potential well is unstable ; it is energetically favorable for the dense gas above to fall , and the magnetized , lower density gas to rise . on small scales , one would expect turbulence or convection to be driven by magnetic bouyancy (  balbus and soker , 1989 , also zoabi , soker & regev 1996 , for applications to clusters ) . on larger scales , one would expect a magnetically supported cluster core to be subject to parker - type instabilities ( parker , 1966 ) . in either regime",
    ", the end effect should be the same  we should expect gas in the central region of a magnetized cluster to be disordered , turbulent , and anything but static .",
    "i am grateful to many of my colleagues for conversations and collaborations relating to magnetic fields in clusters .",
    "it is a particular pleasure to thank frazer owen , chris garasi , ellen zweibel , greg taylor , and tracy clarke for recent discussions .",
    "however , any errors or misconceptions herein are my fault , not theirs .",
