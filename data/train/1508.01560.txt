    "kuranishi structures were introduced to symplectic topology by fukaya and ono @xcite , and refined by joyce @xcite , in order to extract homological data from compactified moduli spaces of holomorphic maps in cases where geometric regularization approaches such as perturbations of the almost complex structure do not yield a smooth structure on the moduli space .",
    "these geometric methods generally can not handle curves that are nowhere injective .",
    "the first instance in which it was important to overcome these limitations was the case of nowhere injective spheres , which are then multiply covered and have nontrivial isotropy . because of this , the development of virtual transversality techniques in @xcite , and the related work by li and tian @xcite , was focussed on dealing with finite isotropy groups , while some algebraic , topological , and analytic issues were not resolved .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explain these issues , provide a framework for resolving them , and demonstrate this in the first nontrivial case . to that end",
    "we focus on the most fundamental issues , which are already present in applying virtual transversality techniques to moduli spaces of holomorphic spheres without nodes or nontrivial isotropy .",
    "we give a survey of regularization techniques in symplectic topology in section  [ s : fluff ] , pointing to some general analytic issues in sections  [ ss : geom ] [ss : kur ] , and discussing the specific algebraic and topological issues of the kuranishi approach in sections  [ ss : alg ] and [ ss : top ] .",
    "the main analytic issue in each regularization approach is in the construction of transition maps for a given moduli space , where one has to deal with the lack of differentiability of the reparametrization action on infinite dimensional function spaces discussed in section  [ s : diff ] .",
    "when building a kuranishi atlas on a moduli space , this issue also appears in a sum construction for basic charts on overlaps , and has to be dealt with separately for each specific moduli space .",
    "we explain the construction of basic kuranishi charts , their sums , and transition maps in the case of spherical gromov ",
    "witten moduli spaces in section  [ s : construct ] , outlining the proof of a more precise version of the following in theorem  [ thm : a2 ] .",
    "* theorem a. *    _ let @xmath0 be a symplectic manifold with tame almost complex structure , and let @xmath1 be the space of simple @xmath2-holomorphic maps @xmath3 in class @xmath4 with one marked point , modulo reparametrization . if @xmath1 is compact ( e.g.  if @xmath4 is @xmath5-minimal \" ) , then we construct an open cover @xmath6 by `` footprints '' of basic kuranishi charts @xmath7 , that are compatible in the following sense : _    for any tuple @xmath8 of basic charts with overlapping footprints , whose obstruction spaces @xmath9 satisfy a `` transversality condition '' , there is transition data as follows : we construct a `` sum chart '' @xmath10 with obstruction space @xmath11 and footprint @xmath12 , such that a restriction of each basic chart @xmath13 includes into @xmath10 by a coordinate change .",
    "moreover , we construct coordinate changes @xmath14 from @xmath10 to @xmath15 for each @xmath16 , so that the collection of basic kuranishi charts and tranisition data @xmath17 forms an additive weak kuranishi atlas in the sense of definitions  [ def : k ] , [ def : ku2 ] ;    the abstract notions of kuranishi chart , restriction , and coordinate change are introduced in detail in section  [ s : chart ] . throughout , we simplify the discussion by assuming that all isotropy groups are trivial . in that special case",
    "our basic definitions largely follow @xcite , though avoiding notions of germs .",
    "we then introduce in section  [ s : ks ] a new notion of kuranishi atlas as a covering family of basic charts together with transition data satisfying a cocycle condition involving an inclusion requirement on the domains of the coordinate changes . at this point",
    "one could already try to construct compatible transverse perturbations of the sections in each kuranishi chart .",
    "however , there is no guarantee that the perturbed zero set modulo transition maps is a closed manifold , in particular hausdorff  which is an essential requirement in the construction of a _ virtual moduli cycle _ , which should be a cycle in an appropriate homology theory representing the _ virtual fundamental class _ of @xmath18 .",
    "this first topological issue , along with many others , is remedied by our theory of topological kuranishi atlases @xcite , which is universally applicable to regularization approaches of kuranishi type ( involving e.g.  isotropy , boundary and corners , or lack of differentiability ) .",
    "thus sections  [ s : chart ] , [ s : ks ] , [ ss : red ] are mostly an expository demonstration of the ease of adapting @xcite to a specific differentiable setting  in our case yielding a self - contained development of the theory of smooth kuranishi atlases and cobordisms with trivial isotropy , in which most proofs are quoted directly from @xcite .    in particular , we construct a _ virtual neighbourhood _ of the moduli space , with hausdorff topology , in which the perturbed zero set modulo transition maps is a compact subset .",
    "this construction in @xcite requires _ tameness _ of the atlas , in particular a",
    "_ strong cocycle condition _ in which the domain of a composition of coordinate changes equals the domain of a direct coordinate change .",
    "however , the coordinate changes arising from sum constructions as in theorem  a generally only satisfy a _ weak cocycle condition _ on the overlap of domains , thus yielding a _ weak kuranishi atlas_. on the other hand , sum constructions naturally provide an _ additivity _ property for the obstruction spaces , and",
    "@xcite develops a shrinking process that refines filtered weak kuranishi atlases to tame kuranishi atlases .",
    "while the implementation of these results in our setting in section  [ ss : tame ] is lengthy due to the development of the language of tameness , shrinkings , etc .",
    ", it only requires one nontrivial proof : additivity implies filtration .",
    "similarly , section  [ ss : red ] transfers the notion of _ reductions _ from @xcite to our context , which drastically reduces the complexity of compatibility conditions in the construction of perturbations .",
    "moreover , both shrinkings and reductions are shown to be unique up to a notion of _ concordance _ that is developed in section  [ ss : kcobord ] as special case of _ kuranishi cobordism_.    based on these algebraic and topological preparations , section  [ ss : sect ] develops the notion of _ precompact transverse ( cobordism ) perturbations _ and shows that the perturbed zero sets are closed manifolds resp .",
    "then the main technical effort in this paper is to prove existence and uniqueness of these perturbations in section  [ ss : const ] .",
    "next , the main conceptual effort is the development of a theory of orientations in section  [ ss : vorient ] .",
    "both of these main efforts are presented in a way that should allow for direct extensions to many other differentiable settings , as we demonstrate in the case of nontrivial isotropy in @xcite .",
    "finally , section  [ ss : vfc ] proves the following kuranishi regularization theorem .",
    "* theorem b. *    _ let @xmath19 be an oriented , @xmath20-dimensional , additive weak kuranishi atlas with trivial isotropy on a compact metrizable space @xmath18",
    ". then @xmath19 determines _    * a * virtual moduli cycle ( vmc ) * , that is a cobordism class of smooth , oriented , compact @xmath20-dimensional manifolds ; * a * virtual fundamental class ( vfc ) * , that is an element @xmath21^{vir}_{{\\mathcal k}}$ ] in the ech homology group @xmath22 .    both depend only on the oriented , additive weak cobordism class of @xmath19 .",
    "precise statements are given in theorems  [ thm : vmc1 ] and [ thm : vmc2 ] .",
    "we use rational , rather than integer , ech homology , since we need a continuity property explained in remark  [ rmk : cech ] .",
    "a novel point here is that the virtual fundamental class can be realized as an actual homology class on the moduli space @xmath18 , which can then be pushed forward by e.g.  evaluation maps .",
    "previous constructions of the vfc were also `` virtual '' in the sense that they only constructed pushforwards of the vfc . moreover , they require compatible and smooth extensions of the evaluation maps to the full domains of the kuranishi charts , rather than just a continuous map defined on @xmath18 , which induces maps from the zero sets .",
    "* extensions : * we prove theorem  b in a narrative that should be applicable to any differentiable refinement of a notion of topological kuranishi atlases with the above two features ( existence and uniqueness of precompact transverse perturbations , and a coherent theory of orientations ) . for example",
    ", in the case of nontrivial isotropy in @xcite , the proofs only differ in the use of multivalued perturbations , which are obtained by pullback of precompact transverse perturbations constructed in section  [ ss : const ] .",
    "their effect is to replace closed manifolds as perturbed solution sets with weighted branched manifolds , which have a rational fundamental class .",
    "so the resulting vmc is a cobordism class of weighted branched manifolds , whereas the vfc remains a rational ech homology class .",
    "one limiting factor to the applicability of kuranishi regularization ( in fact any abstract regularization approach ) is that one must start off from a compactified moduli space , and that all singular curves in the compactification , however `` nongeneric '' , need to be covered with kuranishi charts . at the moment",
    ", this excludes applications to both the asd - with - lagrangian - boundary - condition and quilt - with - strip - shrinking moduli spaces studied by the second author , since their compactifications have not ( yet ) been constructed , let alone given local fredholm descriptions near the putative exotic bubbling phenomena .",
    "* organization : * the following remarks in  [ ss : back ] on the context of this project , together with sections  [ s : fluff ] and [ s : diff ] , provide a survey of regularization techniques in symplectic topology and their pitfalls .",
    "section  [ s : construct ] continues this discussion for the specific example of kuranishi atlases for genus zero gromov ",
    "witten moduli spaces , and also outlines an approach to proving theorem  a. all of these sections are essentially self - contained and can be read in any order .",
    "the main technical parts of the paper , sections  [ s : chart ] , [ s : ks ] , [ s : red ] , and [ s : vmc ] , are independent of the previous sections , but strongly build on each other as well as @xcite towards a proof of theorem  b. for readers not familiar with this subject , we recommend section  [ s : fluff ] ( with  [ ss : poly ] ,  [ ss : alg ] skippable ) as introduction to these technical parts . in order to make our exposition as",

    "references to the corresponding content of @xcite is given at the beginning of definitions resp .",
    "in the proof or results . readers familiar with @xcite should be able to skim sections  [ s : chart ] , [ s : ks ] , [ ss : red ] fairly quickly , taking note of only a few new concepts and results , of which only the first two are needed for the vmc / vfc construction in this paper :    definition  [ def : change ] introduces an index condition , which lemma  [ le : change ] shows to be equivalent to the tangent bundle condition of @xcite , and which is compatible with composition by lemma  [ le : cccomp ] .",
    "definition  [ def : ku2 ] introduces a notion of additivity for ( weak ) kuranishi atlases , which by lemma  [ le : ku3 ] induces a canonical filtration on the underlying ( weak ) topological kuranishi atlas .",
    "definition  [ def : kcomm ] introduces a notion of commensurability between additive weak kuranishi atlases , which by lemma  [ lem : cobord1 ]  ( iii ) implies additive weak concordance .",
    "example  [ ex : nonlin ] shows that the obstruction bundle @xmath23 of a kuranishi atlas may fail to have well defined linear structures on the fibers , though tameness guarantees compatible linear structures by proposition  [ prop : khomeo ] .",
    "lemma  [ le : phitrans ] shows that transition maps in tame kuranishi atlases have tightly controlled images that intersect transversely .",
    "proposition  [ prop : red ] associates to any reduction of a tame kuranishi atlas a kuranishi atlas that  while neither additive nor tame  satisfies the strong cocycle condition .",

    "background : * following gromov s seminal work @xcite , the construction of gromov - witten invariants in the symplectic setting was first developed in the 1980s in settings where the moduli spaces , for appropriate choice of almost complex structure , carry a natural fundamental class or pseudocycle .",
    "comparisons with the algebro - geometric setting , in which the gromov - witten spaces carry a `` virtual fundamental class '' , soon indicated that one should also be able to define such a class in general symplectic settings ( and for the large variety of moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves ) , using more abstract regularization approaches based on the local description of moduli spaces as zero sets of fredholm sections .",
    "various approaches were proposed in the 1990s by fukaya ",
    "ono @xcite , li  tian @xcite , liu ",
    "tian @xcite , ruan  @xcite , siebert @xcite .",
    "in the 2000s , the geometric methods were refined by cieliebak ",
    "mohnke @xcite ( with further developments in @xcite ) , while the abstract approaches were extended by e.g.  chen ",
    "tian @xcite , chen  li @xcite , fukaya  oh  ohta - ono @xcite , joyce @xcite , lu @xcite , lu ",
    "tian @xcite to include a growing variety of moduli spaces and localization tools . however , these are all variations of either an obstruction bundle approach or a kuranishi approach , as explained in ",
    "[ ss : approach ] . a third type of abstract regularization approach is still being developed by hofer ",
    "zehnder [ hwz15 ] .",
    "* motivations : * in a 2009 talk at msri @xcite , the second author posed foundational questions on all these abstract regularization approaches . the first author , who had been uneasily aware of analytic problems with the approach of @xcite , the basis of her expository article @xcite , decided that now was the time to clarify the constructions once and for all .",
    "we found that within the obstruction bundle framework used in @xcite ( which is most closely related to the obstruction theory of algebraic geometry , as explained in ",
    "[ ss : approach ] ,  [ ss : ltbs ] ) we could not overcome the issue of lack of differentiability of the reparametrization action .",
    "this enters both via local slices of the action or deligne  mumford type spaces of domains and maps , and is discussed in detail in ",
    "[ s : diff ] . when attempting to resolve these issues via a kuranishi approach ( which focusses on finite dimensional reductions as explained in ",
    "[ ss : kur ] ) , we soon found the differentiability issue in the compatibility of charts , but realized that this issue could be resolved by geometric construction of obstruction spaces , as we explain in  [ s : construct ] .",
    "however , in making the abstract framework explicit , we needed to resolve ambiguities in the notion of a kuranishi structure , concerning the precise meaning of germ of coordinate changes and the cocycle condition , discussed in ",
    "[ ss : alg ] . more generally , we found it difficult to find a notion of kuranishi structure that on the one hand clearly has a virtual fundamental class ( some version of theorem b ) , and on the other hand arises from fairly simple analytic techniques for holomorphic curves ( some version of theorem a ) . one issue that we will mention only briefly in  [ ss : approach ] is the lack of smoothness of the standard gluing constructions , which affects the smoothness of the kuranishi charts near nodal or broken curves .",
    "the topological issues mentioned above and discussed in detail in  [ ss : top ] are more fundamental and surprising since there had been little doubt even in our minds that the perturbative construction of an euler class for orbibundles should have a straightforward generalization to `` patching local euler classes arising from a cover by local finite dimensional reductions '' .    most of these oversights seem to happen when only an oversimplified model case  such as the euler class of an orbifold bundle or an equivariant fredholm section with compact zero set  is worked out in detail , and the extension to an actually relevant setting is merely sketched or left to intuition .",
    "this motivated our decision to give a completely explicit vfc construction in the simplest relevant and nontrivial case .",
    "we have moreover found the topic of regularization of moduli spaces to lack the `` structural stability '' of other topics in symplectic geometry , in which a reasonable set of ideas almost always has a rigorous proof in its span , and imprecisions can be corrected locally .",
    "this is likely due to the otherwise safe intuitions from physics and algebraic geometry failing to have traction on this topic . as a result ,",
    "our theory had to undergo constant global changes until the last technical piece was in place .",
    "this is our reason for insisting on excruciating precision in each definition and step of proof .",
    "* relations : * as the core of our work @xcite was nearing completion , we alerted fukaya et al and joyce to some of the issues we had uncovered .",
    "the ensuing discussion resulted in new versions of their approaches @xcite and also motivated a new version of the kuranishi approach by pardon  @xcite , while additional work on the obstruction bundle approach appeared in @xcite .",
    "we will comment on all these approaches in  [ s : fluff ] though we have not verified any of these papers in sufficient detail to endorse their correctness .",
    "here we compare the basic kuranishi notions .    while the previous definitions of kuranishi structures in @xcite are algebraically inconsistent as explained in  [ ss : alg ] ,",
    "our approach is compatible with the notions of @xcite in the case of trivial isotropy .",
    "indeed we show in remark  [ rmk : otherk ] how to obtain a kuranishi structure in the latter sense from a weak kuranishi atlas . however , the two approaches differ significantly when isotropy is nontrivial ; see @xcite",
    ". one can make an analogy with the development of the theory of orbifolds : the approach of @xcite is akin to satake s definition of a @xmath24-manifold , while our definitions are much closer to the idea of describing an orbifold as the realization of an tale proper groupoid . in our view , weak kuranishi atlases in the sense of definition  [ def : k ] are the natural outcomes of constructions of compatible finite dimensional reductions , and we see a clear abstract path from an atlas to a vmc . constructing a weak atlas involves checking only a finite number of consistency conditions for the coordinate changes , while uncountably many such conditions must be checked if one tries to construct a kuranishi structure directly .",
    "the notion of implicit atlas in @xcite is essentially our notion of tame kuranishi atlas , even in the case of nontrivial isotropy .",
    "while we obtain tameness by an abstract refinement process from a much weaker structure , @xcite aims to obtain this directly from canonical analytic descriptions of the moduli space  at the expense of a differentiable structure in the kuranishi charts .",
    "we will further compare the different variations of the kuranishi approach in remarks  [ rmk : jbs ] and [ rmk : otherk ] .",
    "* outlook : * the present kuranishi regularization theorem b applies only to gromov ",
    "witten moduli spaces that contain neither nodal nor multiply covered curves ( as shown in theorem a )",
    ". however , a generalization of our approach to other moduli spaces of closed pseudoholomorphic curves with gromov compactification only requires two distinct additions to both the abstract theory and the constructions on a moduli space :    multiply covered curves yield local finite dimensional reductions in which a nontrivial isotropy group acts . in @xcite",
    ", we capture this abstractly in a notion of kuranishi atlases with nontrivial isotropy and extend our vmc / vfc construction to this case .",
    "this notion captures significantly more information than the notions of kuranishi structures in @xcite , but we show in @xcite how it naturally arises from genus zero gromov  witten moduli spaces . for an outline see the august 2013 lecture  @xcite .",
    "( this requires recasting the constructions of  [ s : construct ] in terms of stabilizations rather than local obstruction bundles , and a systematic addition of marked points on which the isotropy groups act by permutation . )",
    "nodal curves have neighbourhoods described by gluing constructions .",
    "these again yield kuranishi charts with trivial or nontrivial isotropy , but the smooth structures in different gluing charts are usually not preserved by coordinate changes .",
    "this issue needs to be addressed either by constructing more compatible smooth structures , or by proving a regularization theorem for kuranishi atlases with less compatible smooth structures . the classical gluing theory in e.g.  @xcite yields kuranishi charts with stratified smooth structures , and we checked that these are preserved by coordinate changes .",
    "we also believe that it should be feasible to extend our vmc / vfc constructions to this case , though it will require refined notions of stratified smoothness with chain rules .",
    "we are not planning to work on this extension but will be happy to assist others if the need arises . instead , the gluing theorems from polyfold theory yield smooth kuranishi atlases with nontrivial isotropy , to which our vmc / vfc constructions in @xcite apply directly .",
    "in fact , @xcite announced a general construction of smooth kuranishi structures from a proper fredholm section in a polyfold bundle .",
    "however , the price to pay by using polyfold theory ( apart from the temptation of using its own regularization theorem directly ) is that it uses a smooth structure on the deligne - mumford spaces ( constructed in @xcite with globally rescaled gluing parameters ) which is not compatible with their complex structure .",
    "an intermediate approach to the gluing issue is being taken by castellano @xcite , who proves a gluing theorem that ",
    "after appropriate rescaling of the gluing parameters  yields stratified smooth kuranishi atlases with @xmath25-differentiability across strata , to which the vmc / vfc constructions given here and in @xcite apply with minor modifications .",
    "he moreover shows that the resulting genus zero gromov ",
    "witten invariants satisfy the standard axioms .",
    "we believe that @xmath25-kuranishi atlases ( which then automatically carry a vmc / vfc ) for other moduli spaces of closed holomorphic curves can be constructed analogously , though each case requires a geometric construction of local slices as well as obstruction bundles specific to the setup , and careful gluing analysis .",
    "an extension of our approach to moduli spaces which involve boundary nodes or breaking / buildings , as in floer theories , sft , or the construction of @xmath26-structures , would require  beyond the construction of compatible kuranishi charts on any given moduli space  two more additions to the abstract theory :    the gluing constructions near boundary nodes and breaking yield boundary and corners when moduli spaces are regular .",
    "for the regularization of general moduli spaces , our notion of kuranishi cobordism should have a straightforward generalization that allows for corners and yields ( branched weighted ) manifolds with boundary and corners as vmc .",
    "however , this would require a generalization of the notion of collared boundary in definition  [ def : ycob ] , where two distinct boundary components ( the incoming and outgoing end of a cobordism ) have disjoint collars .",
    "when allowing for corners , the main boundary strata will still be disjoint but have overlapping collars .",
    "since our notion of kuranishi cobordism requires the charts and coordinate changes to have product form on collars , the corner version will require each corner stratum to have a collar homeomorphic to a product with @xmath27  corresponding to gluing parameters , and arising from the overlap of boundary collars .",
    "moreover , the various corner collars will need to be compatible in the sense that e.g.  the @xmath28 collars induced from two different `` orders of gluing '' ( each arising from an overlap of a boundary stratum and a corner stratum with @xmath29 collar ) are the same .",
    "on the one hand , this is necessary to generalize our construction of relative perturbations in proposition  [ prop : ext2 ] . on the other hand , this requires a construction of kuranishi charts from associative gluing maps in the sense of @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge the present gluing constructions in the literature ( including the gluing maps arising from the polyfold approach ) do not naturally satisfy associativity .",
    "( the construction in @xcite crucially uses the morse flow and euclidean normal form near critical points . )    more globally , the gluing constructions identify the boundary strata of each moduli space with ( fibered ) products of other moduli spaces of similar type , and the vmc / vfc construction is required to be compatible with these `` gluing operations '' in order to obtain the intended algebraic structures such as @xmath30 in floer theory , or the @xmath26-relations .",
    "thus the regularization has to solve the additional task of respecting the fiber product structure on the boundary .",
    "in perturbative approaches , this issue is also known as constructing coherent perturbations and has to be addressed separately in each specific geometric setting since it requires a hierarchy of moduli spaces which permits one to construct the perturbations iteratively . in the construction of the floer differential on a finitely generated complex , such an iteration can be performed using an energy filtration thanks to the algebraically simple gluing operation . however , once one deals with homotopies of data or wants to prove independence from the choice of perturbations , compatibility with the gluing operation usually excludes transversality relative to the boundary strata  in particular , @xmath31-dimensional moduli spaces arising from homotopies can intersect corner strata of arbitrarily high degeneracy .",
    "this has been resolved in some special cases by a refined gluing analysis @xcite or artificial deformation of the gluing operation @xcite , but there does not seem to be a general understanding , let alone solution method , for this issue .",
    "it seems to us that polyfold theory is better suited to regularize moduli spaces which involve boundary nodes or breaking .",
    "since it avoids finite dimensional reductions , it only requires constructions of pregluing maps  which are naturally associative .",
    "it also offers weaker notions of transversality relative to the boundary stratification and provides an analytic framework in which the obstruction bundle gluing analysis @xcite can be generalized to settings in which there is at most one way of gluing a curve to itself @xcite .",
    "finally , many applications of pseudoholomorphic curve invariants require equivariant regularization .",
    "for example , floer s proof of the arnold conjecture @xcite argues with an @xmath32action by reparametrizations on the floer trajectory space @xmath33 for an autonomous hamiltonian , whose fixed points ( and hence only solutions in dimension @xmath34 ) are the morse trajectories . when geometric ( automatically @xmath32-equivariant ) regularization fails , the argument was translated into abstract regularization terms by @xcite roughly as follows : the compactified floer trajectory space @xmath35 is equipped with a kuranishi atlas of index @xmath34 and an @xmath32action whose fixed point set @xmath36 are the morse trajectories , at which the kuranishi section is transverse .",
    "this induces a kuranishi atlas on @xmath37 that has index @xmath38 and thus allows for a perturbation with empty solution set . pulling this back to @xmath35",
    "yields a perturbation whose only solutions are @xmath39 . in order to make such a proof rigorous in our perturbative framework",
    ", one has to deal with the following challenges :    a notion of @xmath32action on a kuranishi atlas should involve compatible @xmath32actions on the kuranishi domains and obstruction spaces with respect to which the sections are equivariant .",
    "when  as in the arnold case ",
    "the sections are transverse at the @xmath32fixed points in the zero set , and the action on the zero set is otherwise free , then one can expect the existence of an equivariant transverse perturbation .",
    "its construction via a quotient of the kuranishi atlas would have to shrink domains appropriately to avoid all @xmath32fixed points , not just those in the zero set .",
    "since the compactified floer trajectory space @xmath35 may contain irregular solutions of all kinds , such as broken trajectories , or trajectories with sphere bubbles , the @xmath32equivariant kuranishi charts have to be constructed near all kinds of solutions .",
    "this requires choices of obstruction spaces that are equivariant under the non - differentiable @xmath32action as well as gluing constructions that are compatible with the diagonal @xmath32-action on broken floer trajectories .",
    "theories addressing these points are now announced in @xcite .",
    "again , it seems to us that polyfold theory is better suited to achieve equivariant regularization since the first challenge only requires another generalization of a classical theorem in finite dimensional differential geometry  something that has already been achieved in many instances for the polyfold framework  and the second challenge is absent since the natural @xmath32action on the ambient polyfold is already scale - smooth and compatible with pregluing .    in summary , the kuranishi approach seems to be less technologically sophisticated and thus mostly has value in the gromov  witten setting , especially in very geometric situations such as @xcite , or in situations very close to algebraic geometry such as @xcite .",
    "our project aims to develop the needed theory in the simplest way possible , using basic tools from general and differential topology rather than sheaf theory or sophisticated category theory as in @xcite .",
    "one of the central technical problems in the theory of holomorphic curves , which provides many of the modern tools in symplectic topology , is to construct algebraic structures by extracting homological information from moduli spaces of holomorphic curves in general compact symplectic manifolds @xmath40 .",
    "we will refer to this technique as _ regularization _ and note that it requires several distinct components : some perturbation technique is used to achieve _",
    "transversality _ , which gives the moduli space a smooth structure .",
    "in order for this to induce a count or chain , the perturbation also has to preserve _ compactness _ and a suitable version of _ hausdorffness _ of the moduli space .",
    "moreover , some type of cobordism technique is used to achieve _ invariance _ , i.e.  independence of the resulting homological information from the choices involved .",
    "the aim of this section is to give an overview of the different regularization approaches in the case of genus zero gromov ",
    "witten invariants @xmath41 .",
    "these are defined as a generalized count of @xmath2-holomorphic genus @xmath34 curves in class @xmath42 that meet @xmath43 representing cycles of the homology classes @xmath44 .",
    "this number should be independent of the choice of @xmath2 in the contractible space of @xmath45-compatible almost complex structures , and of the cycles representing @xmath46 .",
    "for complex structures @xmath2 one can work in the algebraic setting , in which the curves are cut out by holomorphic functions on @xmath47 , but general symplectic manifolds do not support an integrable @xmath2 . for non - integrable @xmath2 ,",
    "the approach introduced by gromov @xcite is to view the ( pseudo-)holomorphic curves as maps to @xmath47 satisfying the cauchy ",
    "riemann pde , modulo reparametrizations by automorphisms of the complex domain .    to construct the gromov ",

    "such a construction takes one quickly out of the class of minimal germs .",
    "\\(ii ) another approach to resolving the algebraic challenges of capturing the ambiguity of local finite dimensional reductions is proposed in @xcite using so - called `` d - orbifolds '' , which have more algebraic properties than kuranishi structures .",
    "roughly speaking , this notion replaces conjugacy by a more restrictive relation between coordinate changes that does have a 2-categorical interpretation unlike ( spaces , maps , conjugacy ) .",
    "given such a categorical structure , we expect the vfc construction to be similar to ours .",
    "however , it does not offer a direct approach to regularizing moduli spaces , but instead seems to require special types of kuranishi structures or polyfold fredholm sections as starting point : ( * ? ? ?",

    "but note that this is almost a case of equivariant transversality in which e.g.  the polyfold setup should allow for a global finite dimensional reduction as smooth section of an orbifold bundle along the lines of @xcite .",
    "the notion of `` kuranishi space '' in @xcite is closely related to this setup , as of now does not assume `` ( semi)effectiveness '' , but also seems to make no claims of inducing virtual fundamental classes , except via an equivalence to `` d - orbifolds '' . @xmath124       + [ ss : top ] after one has solved the analytic issues involved in constructing compatible basic kuranishi charts as defined in  [ ss : kur ] for a given moduli space @xmath35 , the further difficulties in constructing the virtual fundamental class @xmath194^{\\rm vir}$ ] are all essentially topological , though their solution will impose further requirements on the construction of a kuranishi atlas .",
    "the basic idea for constructing a vmc is to `` patch local euler classes '' .",
    "this is usually achieved by transverse perturbations @xmath276 of the section in each basic chart , such that the smooth zero sets modulo a relation given by the transition data provide a regularization of the moduli space @xmath277 there are various notions of regularization ; the common features ( in the case of trivial isotropy and empty boundary ) are that @xmath278 should be a cw complex with a distinguished homology class @xmath279 $ ] ( e.g.  arising from an orientation and triangulation ) , and that in some sense this class should be independent of the choice of perturbation  @xmath280 .",
    "for example , @xcite require that for any cw complex @xmath281 and continuous map @xmath282 that extends compatibly to the kuranishi charts , the induced map @xmath283 is a cycle , whose homology class is independent of the choice of @xmath280 and extension of @xmath50 .",
    "the basic issues in any regularization are that we need to make sense of the equivalence relation induced by transition data and ensure that the zero set of a transverse perturbation is not just locally smooth ( and hence can be triangulated locally ) , but also that the transition data glues these local charts to a compact hausdorff space without boundary .",
    "these properties are crucial for obtaining a global triangulation and thus well defined cycles .",
