    "accurate measurement of the luminosity function is of prime importance in the study of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "one of the key goals of studying agn is to characterize and understand their strong evolution ( e.g. schmidt 1972 ; braccesi et al .",
    "1980 ; schmidt & green 1983 ; boyle , shanks & peterson 1988 ; hewett , foltz & chaffee 1993 ; boyle et al .",
    "2000 ; croom et al .",
    "2004 , henceforth c04 ; richards et al .",
    "2006 , henceforth r06 ) .",
    "early measurements of the qso luminosity function ( lf ) demonstrated strong evolution in the population , with luminous qsos being much more common at high redshift ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "however , because the shape ( at bright magnitudes ) is a featureless power law , the type of evolution could not be quantified , i.e. , there was no observable difference between density evolution ( a change in the number of objects ) and luminosity evolution ( a change in the luminosities of objects ) .",
    "surveys which probed fainter than the observed break in the lf ( e.g. boyle et al 1990 ) started to allow some understanding of the physical process behind qso evolution .",
    "these studies showed that qso evolution approximately followed pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) , with the same characteristic lf shape evolving to higher luminosities at higher redshift .",
    "a naive interpretation of such evolution would imply that qsos are cosmologically long  lived and fade from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "given their low space density relative to normal galaxies , this also implies that qsos are intrinsically rare . however , more accurate measurements of the bright end of the qso lf showed an evolving slope ( hewett et al . 1993 ; goldschmidt & miller 1998 ; r06 ) , suggesting that qso evolution did not perfectly follow the ple model . at redshifts @xmath21",
    "there is an observed decline in the space density of bright qsos ( osmer 1982 ; warren , hewett & osmer 1994 ; schmidt , schneider & gunn 1995 ; fan et al . 2001 ) .",
    "thus @xmath22 is often known as the _ quasar epoch _",
    ", where qsos ( or quasars ) were most active .",
    "the realization that most massive galaxies contain super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) ( e.g. kormendy & richstone 1995 ) meant that qsos were likely to be intrinsically common .",
    "this result is much more suggestive of a model where qsos are a short - lived process that occurs in most massive galaxies .",
    "the observed evolution is then due to global effects such as a decline in the triggering rate or fuelling of agn , which modulates the distribution of many successive generations .",
    "early measurements of the x - ray agn lf ( e.g. boyle et al . 1993 ) showed evolution which also approximately followed ple . however , the most recent x - ray surveys , in particular using _ chandra _ ( e.g. giacconi et al .",
    "2002 ; alexander et al .",
    "2003 ) and _ xmm - newton _",
    "( e.g. hasinger et al .",
    "2001 ; worsley et al .",
    "2004 ) , reach to much fainter flux levels .",
    "these surveys have demonstrated that pure luminosity evolution fails to match the redshift dependent evolution of the agn lf at @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the characteristic luminosity at which the qso lf flattens ) .",
    "they show that the activity in faint agn peaks at a lower redshift than that of more luminous agn ( e.g. ueda et al .",
    "2003 ; hasinger et al 2005 ) ; this process has been described as agn downsizing ( e.g. barger et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the galaxy population is also seen to undergo a similar downsizing ( cowie et al .",
    "1996 ) , where the most massive galaxies formed the bulk of their stars earlier than lower mass galaxies ( e.g. juneau et al . 2005 ; zheng et al . 2007 ;",
    "noeske et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "given that all massive galaxies contain a smbh , and that there are tight correlations between black hole mass and host properties ( e.g. tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) , the growth of black holes and galaxies must be intimately connected . in particular",
    ", it has been proposed that galaxy mergers trigger major episodes of star formation ( e.g. in ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ) and lead to qso activity ( sanders et al .",
    "such a mechanism can plausibly form spheroidal galaxies and qsos and this idea has been further developed by recent numerical simulations ( e.g. hopkins et al .",
    "in such a picture , accretion onto a smbh is triggered ( at least for moderate to high luminosity agn ) by the merger of gas - rich galaxies .",
    "while the timescale for the merger may be @xmath25gyr , for the majority of this time the accretion is obscured from view by dust .",
    "only when the agn finally expels the surrounding gas and dust does it shine as an optical qso for a brief period ( @xmath26myr ) , before exhausting its fuel supply ( e.g. di matteo et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this feedback of energy from the agn into the host also heats and expels the gas in the galaxy , which suppresses star formation leading to `` red and dead '' ellipticals or bulges .",
    "one of the key predictions of the hopkins et al .",
    "model is that the faint end of the qso luminosity function should largely be comprised of high mass smbhs at low accretion rates ( i.e. well below their peak luminosity ) rather than lower mass smbhs accreting near the eddington rate @xcite .",
    "thus , while the bright end of the qso lf tells us about the intrinsic properties of the qso population during the time when black holes where increasing in mass most rapidly ( e.g. triggering rate , active black hole mass function etc . ) , the faint end of the lf tells us about the length of time qsos spend at relatively low accretion rates .",
    "the 2-degree field ( 2df ) qso redshift survey ( 2qz ; croom et al . 2001 ; 2004 ) covered an area of @xmath27 sq deg , and reached @xmath25 mag fainter than the break in the qso lf at @xmath28 .",
    "however , as the observed break in the lf is a relatively gradual flattening towards faint magnitudes , the constraints from the 2qz on the actual slope of the faint end are uncertain , as demonstrated by the difference between the results from the first release ( boyle et al . 2000 ) and the final release ( croom et al .",
    "2004 ) of the 2qz .",
    "samples that reach substantially deeper are required to properly constrain the shape of the faint qso lf .",
    "such deeper spectroscopic surveys have only covered small areas to date .",
    "wolf et al .",
    "( 2003 ) used the medium - band photometric data from the combo-17 survey to construct a qso lf to @xmath29 that contains @xmath30 qsos over an area of 1 deg@xmath3 .",
    "they provided a measurement of the qso lf over the redshift range @xmath31 , but were unable to differentiate between density and luminosity evolution .",
    "jiang et al . ( 2006 ) used the deep sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) data from the fall equatorial stripe ( `` stripe 82 '' ) to construct a sample of 400 qsos over @xmath32 deg@xmath3 to @xmath33 .",
    "they found good agreement with the early 2df - sdss lrg and qso ( 2slaq ) survey results of richards et al .",
    "( 2005 ; henceforth r05 ) , but were not able to see any clear evidence of downsizing in the agn population . using data from the vlt vimos deep survey ( vvds ) , bongiorno et al .",
    "( 2007 ) constructed a qso lf to a limit of @xmath34 with 130 qsos in an area of 1.7 deg@xmath3 .",
    "when combined with the sdss data from r06 , these authors found that their data are better fit by a luminosity  dependent density evolution model ( ldde ) , which also matches x - ray samples , suggestive of downsizing .",
    "the 2slaq survey ( croom et al . 2009 ; c09 ) was specifically designed to probe the faint end of the qso lf , reaching approximately 1 magnitude deeper than the 2qz . a key requirement of the 2slaq survey was that it should cover sufficient area to allow accurate measurement of qso clustering , as well as to reduce the random errors in the measurement of the lf , spectral properties etc .",
    "richards et al .",
    "( 2005 ) presented the qso luminosity function from an early 2slaq data set using @xmath35 qsos ; this result shows an excess over the 2qz survey at @xmath36 , but still clearly demonstrates a break in the lf . in this paper",
    "we present the qso luminosity function for the final 2slaq sample .",
    "in addition to containing approximately twice as many qsos , this analysis also makes use of the improved completeness estimates presented by c09 , which includes the impact of qso host galaxies . in section [ sec : data ]",

    "we summarize the key properties of the sample .",
    "qso candidates are selected with @xmath41 [ sdss point spread function ( psf ) photometry , extinction corrected ] , using a multi - colour method which primarily selects uv - excess objects .",
    "this limits the redshift range to @xmath42 , with the completeness falling below 50 per cent at @xmath43 .",
    "qso candidates fainter than @xmath44 had higher priority when configuring a field for observation with 2df , as the main focus of the survey was on the faint end of the qso luminosity function .",
    "the 2slaq survey covers an area of 191.9 deg@xmath3 in two regions along the celestial equator ( declination @xmath45 to @xmath46 ) in the north and south galactic caps ( henceforth named the ngp and sgp regions ) .",
    "this area corresponds to a cosmological volume of 4.0  gpc@xmath47 over the redshift range @xmath0 ( in our assumed cosmology ) .",
    "the observations contain new spectra of 16326 objects , of which 8764 are qsos .",
    "a total of 7623 of these are newly discovered , with the remainder previously identified by the 2qz ( croom et al .",
    "2004 ) and sdss @xcite surveys .",
    "the full qso sample contains 12702 qsos and is presented in c09 .",
    "c09 discuss the completeness of the 2slaq qso sample in detail .",
    "in particular , because the survey is somewhat fainter than previous large qso surveys , it is important to take into account the effect of the host galaxy on completeness .",
    "c09 showed that qsos at @xmath7 near the faint limit of the survey are significantly redder because of the contribution of the host galaxy component , and that this reduces the completeness of the colour selection .",
    "this has also been demonstrated in the small but complete sample of qsos from the vvds ( gavignaud et al .",
    "an accurate k - correction is required to properly account for the redshifting of the observed pass - bands when calculating absolute magnitudes or fluxes . in qso spectra ,",
    "broad emission lines can also contribute a significant fraction of the flux ( typically 0.20.5 mags ) in a photometric band .",
    "as faint targets in the 2slaq sample can be affected by their host galaxy , we also need to subtract the host flux to obtain the nuclear component .",
    "this is in contrast to most previous samples ( e.g. 2qz , sdss ) , where an absolute magnitude limit was applied to the sample , and objects brighter than that limit were assumed not to be significantly affected by flux from their hosts .",
    "the detailed completeness simulations described by c09 enable correction of the 2slaq qso magnitudes for their mean host galaxy contributions .",
    "the photometric data used to select qsos are the sdss psf magnitudes , so this will already limit the host galaxy flux to some extent ( e.g. schneider et al .",
    "however , c09 demonstrated that at low luminosity the host galaxies of the 2slaq sample can still significantly alter their observed colours .",
    "we use the modelled host properties presented by c09 to correct the 2slaq qsos for the contribution of their host galaxies . for each simulated source c09",
    "calculate the total , nuclear  only and host  only magnitudes .",
    "we can then derive the mean correction from total to nuclear magnitude in @xmath1 and @xmath48 intervals ( note that here , and throughout this paper , @xmath48 denotes redshift and not a magnitude in the sdss @xmath48-band ) .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "16a and table 12 of c09 . in the @xmath1-band , in which the 2slaq sample was selected",
    ", the host contribution is less than 20 per cent at @xmath49 , even for the faintest sources .",
    "thus , corrections for the host galaxy have only a limited effect on the measured qso lf .",
    "several studies have determined k - corrections for qsos . typically , to k - correct to @xmath50 , a power law correction of the form @xmath51 has been used , with @xmath52 . while qsos have an underlying power law continuum , the broad emission lines in their spectra have a significant impact on the total flux in a given band .",
    "cristiani & vio ( 1990 ) , in their k - correction analysis , include the impact of emission lines using composite qso spectra .",
    "wisotzki ( 2000 ) derived k - corrections from the optical / uv spectrophotometry of qsos made available by elvis et al .",
    "this study resulted in a k - correction that is substantially steeper at low redshift ( @xmath53 ) than other work , flattening to a more typical power law at higher redshift .",
    "r06 suggested removing the emission line contributions to the flux before determining a luminosity .",
    "this gives a more direct measurement of the energy output from the central engine , unbiased by the location of the pass - band with respect to the qso emission line spectrum .",
    "following r06 we also correct for the emission line flux and construct an emission line k - correction , @xmath54 . the emission line k - correction includes a contribution from emission lines to the @xmath1-band flux at @xmath50 ( predominantly h@xmath55 , h@xmath56 ,  and some iron emission ) and thus is not zero at @xmath50 . to determine @xmath54 we take a median of the emission line k - corrections derived from the simulated qso spectra constructed by c09 . in this emission line k - correction",
    "we also include the effect of lyman-@xmath13 forest absorption .",
    "it is also useful to normalize the k - correction closer to the median redshift of the sample ( e.g. blanton et al .",
    "2003 ) , to minimize the extrapolation required for the bulk of the objects .",
    "although the mean redshift of the 2slaq sample is @xmath57 , we will normalize our k - corrections to @xmath58 in order to be consistent with r06 .",
    "this @xmath58 @xmath1-band k - correction acts as a @xmath1band filter with the wavelengths divided by @xmath59 . to obtain a total k - correction ,",
    "we then add a power law component with @xmath60 .",
    "this power law slope is slightly different from the standard @xmath61 usually assumed , but was found to give the best match to observed qso colours in the simulations of c09 .",
    "a comparison of different k - correction estimates in the literature is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kcorr]a . in the cases which do not explicitly include the @xmath50 emission line correction we have added this contribution , so that these provide k - corrections to a continuum magnitude at @xmath50 .",
    "the qso k - corrections normalized at @xmath50 increasingly diverge towards high redshift .",
    "in contrast , if we normalize the k - corrections at @xmath58 ( fig . [",
    "fig : kcorr]b ) , the k - corrections are much more consistent over the redshift range we are sampling , @xmath62 .",
    "we note that the 2slaq k - corrections and those of wisotzki ( 2000 ) match very well , apart from at @xmath50 .",
    "however , there is a substantial difference between the emission line - only components of these k - corrections ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kcorr]c ) .",
    "we attribute this difference to the difficulty of defining the _ true _ continuum regions of qso spectra , as opposed to regions which are just free from the major emission lines , but which may still contain significant contributions from iron lines and other weaker emission features .",
    "in our analysis below we will use our k - corrections ( black line in fig .",
    "[ fig : kcorr ] ) , and correct to the continuum flux in the @xmath1-band at @xmath58 .",
    "the emission line contribution at this redshift is @xmath63 mag , such that @xmath64 .",
    "r05 used a more traditional k - correction , zero - pointed at @xmath50 , assuming a power law with @xmath65 and no emission line correction . averaged over the sample at @xmath66",
    "we find that we need to subtract 0.41 from the r05 absolute magnitudes to match our new k - corrections ( with a maximum variation with redshift of @xmath67 mag ) .",
    "we find that an identical correction of @xmath68 is needed to transform the cristiani & vio ( 1990 ) k - corrections onto our new k - corrections . in some cases below",
    ", we will be required to use the different k - corrections discussed above to compare our results to those of previous authors .",
    "we first calculate the number counts of qsos as a function of @xmath1 magnitude .",
    "the raw qso counts from the 2slaq sample are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : nmcomp ] ( open squares ) .",
    "the filled squares show the number counts corrected for coverage completeness only ; that is fraction of targets in our survey region which where actually observed .",
    "the coverage completeness is known exactly , while other completeness corrections ( e.g. photometric selection , spectroscopic completeness ; see c09 for details ) have some uncertainties .",
    "the fully corrected counts ( in the redshift range @xmath69 ) are shown by the open and filled circles ( for the ngp and sgp regions respectively ) .",
    "we see no significant difference between the ngp and sgp regions .",
    "[ fig : nm2slaq2qz ] compares the number counts from the preliminary 2slaq sample ( r05 ) to our current determination . in order to directly compare the two",
    ", we use the same k - correction and @xmath10 limit as r05 , namely , a power law k - correction , normalized at @xmath50 with @xmath61 and a limit of @xmath70 .",
    "we also do not make any correction for the host galaxy contribution to the total flux , as this was not done by r05 . despite the different photometric completeness estimates used in our work and r05",
    ", there is excellent agreement between the two estimates of the 2slaq @xmath71 distribution . in particular , the decline at the faintest magnitudes is present in both analyses .",
    "this drop is mostly due to the absolute magnitude cut which preferentially removes objects at the faintest magnitudes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nm2slaq2qz ] we also compare the 2slaq @xmath71 to that derived from the 2qz sample ( croom et al .",
    "as noted by r05 , the 2slaq counts are an excellent match to 2qz at @xmath72 , but at fainter magnitudes 2slaq contains an increasingly higher density of qsos than does 2qz , with this excess reaching @xmath73 per cent at the faintest bin of the 2qz .",
    "we discuss this discrepancy between 2slaq and 2qz number counts in further detail in section [ sec : disnm ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nmother ] we compare the 2slaq number counts ( again using the @xmath50 , @xmath61 power law k - correction and @xmath74 ) to a wide range of previously published number counts .",
    "this includes the main sdss sample ( r06 , filled red triangles ) , which is only plotted at @xmath75 , after which incompleteness strongly effects the @xmath1-band number counts ( as the sample is selected in the @xmath76-band ) .",
    "we also show the older number counts of boyle et al .",
    "( 1988 ; 1990 ) .",
    "these have a similar depth to 2qz and are also consistently below 2slaq at @xmath77 .",
    "the deeper sample of boyle , jones & shanks ( 1991 ) is in agreement with 2slaq ( albeit with large errors ) , while the full koo & kron ( 1988 ) sample , not limited to @xmath78 , lies above 2slaq .",
    "as pointed out by r05 , the number counts for the sub - sample of koo & kron ( 1988 ) qsos limited to @xmath78 is significantly lower , and is below or consistent with 2slaq ( although the kk88 sample is also restricted to @xmath79 ) .",
    "overall there is good agreement between these various analyses ; however , the redshift ranges and limits of these different samples do not always match exactly . detailed comparison to more recent estimates of the qso luminosity function will be presented below .",

    "we first calculate the binned luminosity function using the model weighted estimator suggested by miyaji , hasinger & schmidt ( 2001 ) .",
    "this improves on the @xmath82 estimator devised by page & carrera ( 2000 ) , which partially corrects for binning effects , but assumes a uniform distribution across each bin .",
    "the model weighted estimator uses the best model fit to the _ unbinned _ lf data ( described in section [ sec : mlfits ] ) to correct for the variation of the lf within a bin , which is particularly critical at the steep bright end of the qso lf .",

    "fits described in section [ sec : ledefits ] , although assuming a ple model fit does not produce a significant difference to the estimate of the binned lf .",
    "[ fig : lfmg ] shows the binned 2slaq lf for six different redshift intervals from @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "this binning matches the redshift intervals from the sdss dr3 luminosity function of r06 , except that we have increased the lowest redshift limit from @xmath91 to @xmath92 , which is the lowest redshift at which we trust our completeness corrections .",
    "the 2slaq lf shows the approximate characteristics of ple , that is , a fixed lf shape with an evolving @xmath24 . however , there is also evidence for deviations from a ple model , including variation in slope and normalization which we will investigate below .",

    "brighter than @xmath94 the 2qz and 2slaq qso number counts agree well .",
    "however , we find that the ratios of the differential counts are @xmath96 and @xmath97 for 0.25 mag bins centred on @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively .",
    "the slope of the integrated 2slaq number counts at this magnitude is @xmath100 .",
    "thus , a systematic offset in magnitude of @xmath101 would be sufficient to cause this difference .",
    "such an error must be magnitude dependent , as there is no visible offset between 2qz and 2slaq brighter than @xmath102 .",
    "there are several possible causes for the observed deficit of faint 2qz qsos .",
    "first we check for scale errors in the calibrated photographic photometry , by cross matching the 2qz input catalogue of stellar objects ( smith et al .",
    "2005 ) with sdss imaging data , finding @xmath103 matches to @xmath104 .",
    "this is only possible in the ngp region of the 2qz ( which also overlaps with 2slaq ) .",
    "the sdss magnitudes are converted to an effective sdss @xmath105 magnitude by combining the relation @xmath106 @xcite with the sdss colour transformations given by jester et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to give @xmath107 this transformation is appropriate for stars , as we are comparing the photometry from the full stellar 2qz catalogue , not just the objects selected as qso candidates .",
    "a slightly different transformation is appropriate for qsos ( see jester et al .",
    "we calculate the median magnitude difference [ @xmath108 in 0.1 magnitude intervals , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2qzsdssphot ] .",
    "this difference between the 2qz and sdss magnitudes is almost constant from @xmath109 to 20.85 and is well described by a 8th order polynomial ( solid red line ) over this range . at @xmath110 , @xmath111 is roughly constant , @xmath112 mags , and declines to @xmath113 mag at @xmath114 .",
    "this @xmath115 scale error between @xmath116 and @xmath117 is in the right sense to explain the number counts discrepancy , but is an order of magnitude too small .",
    "a second possible cause of the number counts difference is that the colour selection of the 2qz is less complete than was estimated by c04 .",
    "we match the 2slaq qsos to the 2qz photometry and find that 95 per cent of 2slaq qsos ( at @xmath69 ) would have been selected by 2qz , independent of @xmath105 .",
    "this rules out colour selection as the cause of the number counts discrepancy .",
    "it could also be the case that as we approach the plate limit , sources are not being detected on the ukst plates .",
    "when matching 2slaq qsos to the 2qz photometry , we find that brighter than @xmath118 , @xmath119 per cent of 2slaq sources can be matched to the 2qz stellar photometry ( those missing are in large part due to holes around bright stars in the 2qz catalogue ) . at @xmath120",
    "to @xmath121 only @xmath122 per cent are matched to 2qz , indicating that an increasing fraction of sources are missing from the 2qz catalogue at fainter fluxes , although again , the effect seen is not sufficient to explain the observed discrepancy in the number counts .",
    "we suspect that a combination of small photometric calibration errors , missing objects at fainter fluxes and other currently unknown errors together contribute to the discrepancy seen between the 2slaq and 2qz number counts .",
    "the break in the qso luminosity function we ve measured in this paper is a gradual flattening which takes place over several magnitudes .",
    "most of this flattening occurs just faint - wards of the sdss qso lf , but in the region of overlap , the sdss and 2slaq lfs are in excellent agreement .",
    "the combination of sdss and 2slaq allows us to simultaneously place accurate constraints on both the bright and faint ends of the qso lf , with errors in the binned lf typically @xmath123 dex ( and often @xmath124 dex ) over a range of 56 magnitudes ( i.e. over a factor of 100 in luminosity ) . with errors of this size",
    "much greater care needs to be taken over systematic errors , as these may dominate over the statistical errors .",
    "we find that previous smaller surveys generally agree with the higher precision 2slaq+sdss lf measurements .    when comparing our combined qso lf to the soft x - ray lf of type 1 agn measured by hasinger et al .",
    "( 2005 ) we find good agreement near @xmath125 .",
    "however , the measured bright end slope is significantly steeper in the 2slaq+sdss data set than the x - ray data .",
    "we find that an @xmath126 which has a much weaker dependence on luminosity than previously measured ( e.g. steffen et al .",
    "2006 ) provides an improved match between the luminosity functions .",
    "green et al . ( 2009 ) find a weaker luminosity dependence for @xmath126 , but this is largely limited to fainter luminosities ( @xmath127 ) , and they find a result similar to steffen et al . at brighter magnitudes .",
    "the measured rms scatter in @xmath126 could potentially alter the shape of the lf . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lfconv ] we plot a fiducial double power law luminosity function ( solid line ) and the convolution of this with a gaussian distribution ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the lf retains its shape well away from the break , but the bright end slope is flattened near the break .",
    "the scatter in @xmath128 found by steffen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is @xmath129 dex , corresponding to @xmath130 mags .",
    "such a scatter provides qualitatively the correct flattening of the bright end of the qso lf , although only locally , within @xmath131 mags of @xmath125 . of course , the probability distribution function for such a scatter may not be gaussian , and may also depend on luminosity .",
    "detailed consideration of this is outside the scope of the current paper , and would ideally require the measurement of the bivariate x - ray / optical lf for a sample that was largely complete at both wavelengths .",
    "however , we do note that if scatter in @xmath126 is the cause of the lf difference , this infers that optical / uv luminosity is the independent variable , and x - ray luminosity is the dependent variable .",
    "that is , we need to take the optical lf and convolve it with a gaussian to match the two , rather than take the x - ray lf and convolve this with a gaussian .",
    "this is as one might expect , given that the optical / uv light originates from the accretion disk , while the x - ray originates from a hot corona above the disk .",
    "in fact , it could be argued that both the optical / uv and x - ray luminosities are dependent on the bolometric luminosity , which should directly correlate to the accretion rate . in this case , the dispersion in the bolometric correction to the x - ray must be larger than the dispersion in the bolometric correction to the uv / optical .",
    "the results of mahony et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggest a second possible explanation of the flatter bright end slope of the x - ray lf .",
    "they find that the fraction of agn in the _ rosat _ all sky survey bright source catalogue ( bsc ) which are detected at radio wavelengths by the nrao vla sky survey @xcite and the sydney university molonglo sky survey @xcite increases with increasing redshift . at @xmath132 almost all qsos in the bsc are detected in these radio surveys .",
    "the natural explanation of this is that the very luminous high redshift qsos in the sample are having their x - ray flux boosted by a jet component , which may also be doppler boosted by beaming . in contrast the radio detected fraction ( to the same radio flux limit ) of optically bright qsos is no more that 25 per cent @xcite .",
    "therefore , the numbers of qsos at the bright end of the x - ray lf will be boosted relative to the number in the optical .    the qualitative impression of the lf evolution ( seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : lfsdss ] and [ fig : lfcomb ] ) is of a consistent shape where the characteristic luminosity shifts with redshift .",
    "this is the classical pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) seen in previous optical samples . a very different impression is obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig : lfz ] . here",
    "we see that the space density of fainter qsos peaks at lower redshift than that of high luminosity qsos .",
    "this is equivalent to the agn downsizing seen in x - ray samples ( e.g. barger et al . 2005 ) , although it has not been convincingly seen in optical samples until now .",
    "bongiorno et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that their optical lf is better fit by a ldde model than ple , but do not provide any errors on their model fits to directly assess the significance of downsizing .",
    "such downsizing immediately rules out ple , which due to its functional form , peaks in space density at the same redshift for every luminosity .",
    "direct fitting of models to the unbinned qso lf confirms the disagreement with ple , although we note that the best fit ple model plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lfcomb ] is relatively close to the data in all but the highest redshift interval .",
    "the disagreement with ple is much clearer in fig .",
    "[ fig : lfz ] .",
    "the discord between ple and the 2slaq lf is most prominent at low luminosities and high redshifts .",
    "this is exactly the point at which the downsizing is most noticeable in the binned lf .",
    "there is also some disagreement at @xmath133 and @xmath134 , where the errors on the lf are particularly small given the large numbers of qsos per bin .",
    "a much improved fit is obtained if we use a ldde model . while the functional form of hasinger et al .",
    "( 2005 ) does not provide a reduction in @xmath135 , if we modify this to use a smooth functional form ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : lddesmooth1 ] and [ eq : lddesmooth2 ] ) a much better fit is obtained .",
    "however , this is still a relatively poor fit ( @xmath136 ) and also behaves badly outside of the fitted range of the data . a model which combines luminosity evolution and simple density evolution ( our lede model )",
    "provides a further improvement to the fit with @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) and a k ",
    "s test which is formally consistent at the 1@xmath139 level ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "the lede model is the best match to our combined 2slaq+sdss data set for both the @xmath135 and k  s tests . even in this case",
    "the @xmath135 is still formally a poor fit , it is worth considering whether this is due to residual systematic errors . to do this",
    "we carry out the binned @xmath135 test on the best fit models , adding a fixed fractional error in quadrature to the statistical error on @xmath141 in each bin .",
    "we then determine the systematic error required to make the models acceptable at the 5 per cent level ( i.e. @xmath142 ) .",
    "for the ple model , a global 12 per cent systematic error is required to achieve an acceptable match , while for the ldde and lede models this is only 6 and 4 per cent respectively .",
    "if we fit the lf in narrow magnitude intervals we find further evidence for downsizing ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : zpeak ] ) . even at relatively bright magnitudes ( @xmath143 )",
    "the redshift at which the space density of qsos peaks increases with luminosity , and the peak is well below the maximum redshift of our sample , where completeness starts to decline .",
    "we find this trend is similar to that found by the fit of the ldde model to the full sample ( dashed black line in fig .",
    "[ fig : zpeak ] ) . in comparison , the trends found by bongiorno et al .",
    "( 2007 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : zpeak ] , green dot  dashed line ) and hasinger et al .",
    "( 2005 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : zpeak ] , red dot  dashed line ) , fitting a similar ldde model to vvds and x - ray data respectively , were somewhat flatter , although it is not clear whether this difference is significant .",
    "the maximum @xmath144 in the best fit model of hasinger et al . ( 2005 ) is only @xmath145 which disagrees with the peak in the space density of high luminosity optical qsos ( e.g. r06 and this work ) .",
    "such a disagreement is likely to be due to the relatively low number of x - ray objects at the brightest luminosities . at the lowest luminosities there is good agreement between our estimated @xmath146 and those estimated from the other works .",
    "there are various other evolutionary trends which are inconsistent with the simple ple model ; these include evolution in the bright end slope @xmath13 and evolution in @xmath18 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : lfparams ] ) .",
    "recent simulations ( e.g. hopkins et al .",
    "2006 ) suggest that the faint end slope of the qso lf is set by the light curves of qsos fainter than their peak luminosity .",
    "these hydrodynamical simulations find that the faint end slope is a function of peak luminosity and , indirectly , a function of redshift , as the distribution of peak luminosities shifts towards higher luminosity at higher redshift ( at least up to @xmath17 ) .",
    "our best fit models show no evidence of faint end slope evolution ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : lfparams ] ) and find a slope of @xmath147 .",
    "however , this is consistent with the model faint end slopes of hopkins et al . at redshift @xmath148 , as it is only at the lowest redshifts that the faint end slope is predicted to evolve appreciably .",
    "in fact , the lowest redshift bins in fig . [",
    "fig : lfparams]b do show a steeper slope , more consistent with the predicted turn up ( see fig . 3 of hopkins et al .",
    "2006 ) .    further developments by hopkins et al .",
    "( 2008 ) placed the above light curves into a cosmological context , combining evolving dark matter halo mass functions , halo occupation distributions and merger rates to predict the evolution of the qso population .",
    "this model gives reasonably good agreement with a combination of recent lf measurements , improving on earlier models ( e.g. wyithe & loeb 2002 ) .",
    "the lf presented here has the best combination of dynamic range and precision of any yet measured .",
    "as such , it will provide further constraints on qso formation models .",
    "we find highly significant ( 99.9 per cent ) evolution of the bright end slope of the lf , which steepens from @xmath14 at @xmath20 to @xmath149 at @xmath150 .",
    "this strengthens the previous evidence for such a trend ( e.g. goldschmidt & miller 1998 ) , and is in general agreement with the evolution seen by hopkins et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , although in detail the form of the evolution is somewhat different ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lfparams]a ) .",
    "a naive direct mapping from the evolving dark matter halo mass function would also produce such an evolution in the bright end slope .",
    "qsos typically populate similar mass dark matter halos at all redshifts @xmath151 ( e.g. croom et al . 2005 ) . therefore ,",
    "as the mass function becomes steeper at higher mass ( relative to the break in the mass function ) and the break in the mass function moves to lower mass at higher redshift , the typical qso host mass moves to a steeper part of the mass function with increasing redshift .",
    "however , at @xmath152 the bright end of the lf is seen to flatten again ( richards et al .",
    "2006 ) , in disagreement with a naive mapping from the halo mass function .",
    "the more complex models of hopkins et al .",
    "( 2008 ) appear to reproduce such trends .",
    "in this paper we present the optical qso lf with unprecedented precision and dynamic range .",
    "we do this by combining the 2slaq and sdss data sets to probe both the faint and bright ends of the lf at @xmath93 .",
    "although the evolution of qso lf appears very similar to ple , we find significant departures from this form of evolution .",
    "a form of ldde provides a better fit to the lf , but we find that this can still be improved upon .",
    "we find that the bright end slope and @xmath18 both show significant evolution , so use a modified ple model with added density evolution which we call luminosity evolution + density evolution ( lede ) .",
    "the lede model produces the best fit of all models investigated , although a systematic error of 4 per cent is required to make the data formally consistent ( at the @xmath153 level ) with the model in our @xmath135 test . to make further progress in our understanding of the qso lf",
    ", new measurements at faint magnitudes and high redshift ( @xmath154 ) need to be made , making an accurate measurement of the faint end slope and better constraining the bright end slope .",
    "the aaomega - ukidss - sdss ( aus ) survey ( croom et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , currently underway on the anglo - australian telescope , aims to do this , reaching an equivalent magnitude limit to 2slaq , but up to @xmath155 .",
    "as improvements are made to photometric qso samples , they will also provide the opportunity to investigate the faint end of the qso lf ( e.g. richards et al .",
    "further progress in the optical is also dependent on our ability to account for the contamination in optical samples , particularly at redder wavelengths .",
    "if we can do this , then new larger area optical imaging surveys ( e.g. lsst ; ivezi et al .",
