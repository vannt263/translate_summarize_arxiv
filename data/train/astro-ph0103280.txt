    "luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) are galaxies with infrared luminosity @xmath4(81000 @xmath5 ) greater than @xmath6 .",
    "lirgs are also the most numerous sources with bolometric luminosity greater than @xmath6 in the local universe ( see @xcite for a recent review as well as the definition of infrared luminosity ) .",
    "observations have shown that the large ir luminosity of lirgs is primarily due to intense starbursts in the nuclear regions and that dust - enshrouded active galactic nuclei ( agns ) may only play a minor role in some ultraluminous ( ulirg , @xmath7 ) systems @xcite .",
    "for starbursts to produce the infrared luminosity of lirgs , more than @xmath8 of young massive stars are needed to heat the interstellar dust .",
    "this requires a concentration of at least @xmath8 of molecular gas in a very small region ( @xmath9  1 kpc ) to form these stars ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "most lirgs are found in interacting / merging systems @xcite that are rich in molecular gas @xcite .",
    "the fraction of the lirgs in interacting / merging systems increases with infrared luminosity , from @xmath10 at @xmath11 to @xmath12 at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that galaxy - galaxy interactions play a major role in triggering starbursts in molecular gas - rich galaxies .",
    "a commonly discussed interpretation of the triggering mechanism is that , during the interaction , the gas clouds experience tidal torque produced by either the host galaxy or the companion .",
    "the clouds which lose their angular momentum flow into the circum - nuclear regions of the host galaxies . as a result , the concentration and compression of molecular gas in the circum - nuclear regions give rise to starbursts .",
    "furthermore , during the final stage of the galaxies merging , clouds with small angular momentum may flow into the galactic nuclei and then trigger an agn or an ultraluminous starburst .",
    "this scenario , however , has not been confirmed by observations .",
    "moreover , only a small fraction of optically selected interacting / merging systems are truly ir luminous or show other elevated tracers of star formation @xcite .",
    "there also exist lirgs which are gas - rich interacting galaxies but are not undergoing starbursts ( e.g. , arp 302 @xcite ) .",
    "apparently , galactic interaction is not the only causal factor in the enhanced ir luminosity .",
    "recent numerical simulations of the merging of gas - rich spiral galaxies have shown how the gas and stars may be redistributed during the interaction @xcite .",
    "the simulations can predict a sharp rise and fall in star formation rate ( sfr ) in the nuclear regions of galaxies , by assuming the sfr is proportional to some power of the gas density ( e.g. , the schmidt law ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the physical meaning of the schmidt law itself is still unclear and a range of power indices for the schmidt law are suggested by observations @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to assess whether or not these simplified recipes which relate gas density to star formation produce realistic results .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed that compression of giant molecular clouds due to the over - pressure produced by cloud - cloud collisions in colliding galaxies can produce starbursts in off - nuclear regions . on the other hand ,",
    "simulations @xcite fail to reproduce the gas concentrations in the off - nuclear regions in systems like arp 244 and arp 299 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , a detailed understanding of where and when starbursts take place , as well as the physical mechanism responsible for triggering them , remains unknown .",
    "previous observational studies of starbursts in lirgs have mostly concentrated on ultraluminous or advanced merging systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in such systems , the interstellar medium ( ism )",
    "has already been highly disrupted by the tidal interaction and the starbursts .",
    "therefore , these observations can only provide limited comparison with the models . in order to trace the distribution of gas and the evolution of starbursts along the merging process",
    ", we started a program of multi - wavelength observations to study a sample of lirgs in early / intermediate merging phases .",
    "partial results of this program can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the goal is to sample the evolution of the ism properties in lirgs and to verify observationally the proposed triggering mechanisms of starbursts .    in this paper , we present interferometric observations of the 21 cm line , the 20 cm radio continuum , and the co(10 ) line emission of ngc 6670 ( ugc 11284 ) .",
    "ngc 6670 consists of two edge - on disk galaxies with an angular separation of @xmath14 between the two nuclei . at a redshift ( cz ) of 8684 km @xmath15 ,",
    "its distance is 120 mpc ( @xmath16 = 75 km @xmath15 @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) and the projected nuclear separation is @xmath0 kpc . near infrared ( nir ) images of ngc 6670 show a slightly warped disk ( the western galaxy , ngc 6670w ) and another disk ( the eastern one , ngc 6670e ) with a mildly distorted shape .",
    "the disks appear to just touch each other in the sky plane . because of the edge - on geometry and the lack of optical tidal features , it is difficult to determine the interaction history , the orbital geometry of this system , or even whether the galaxies are spatially related or superposed by chance . as the neutral hydrogen gas has a more extended distribution than stars and is less bound to the parent galaxies , it is a sensitive tracer of gravitational perturbation .",
    "imaging the emission provides the unique opportunity to verify the interaction between the galaxies of ngc 6670 .",
    "the infrared luminosity of ngc 6670 is @xmath19 .",
    "single - dish measurements show a total co flux of 220 jy km @xmath15 , which corresponds to a molecular gas mass of @xmath20 @xcite . the global ratio of @xmath21 is often used as an indication of star formation efficiency , the star formation rate per unit molecular gas mass . in ngc 6670 ,",
    "the global sfe is 10 @xmath2 , only a factor of 2 higher than the average sfe of the giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in the milky way s disk @xcite and of the isolated galaxies @xcite . without knowing the distributions of molecular gas and star formation activity",
    ", one can not tell whether the large ir luminosity of ngc 6670 is due to nuclear starbursts ( @xmath22 @xmath2 , @xcite ) induced by the interaction , or simply due to the large reservoir of molecular gas with a rather ordinary sfe as in arp 302 @xcite .",
    "the infrared space observatory ( iso ) mid - infrared observations of ngc 6670 suggest that most of the mid - infrared emission comes from extended circum - nuclear starbursts but not from dust enshrouded agns @xcite .",
    "our co(10 ) and 20 cm interferometric observations provide a higher resolution view that allows us to investigate the distribution of molecular gas and star formation .",

    "based on previous observations , @xcite described the morphologic components of the ngc 6670 system as a `` post - eruptive quadruple system of three brush - like and one spherical compact '' galaxies .",

    "these images reveal that the two largest galaxies in this system are a pair of nearly edge - on spiral galaxies .",
    "the relatively weak bulges of these two galaxies , compared to the disks , suggest that these two galaxies are late type spiral galaxies . to the southeast of the nucleus of ngc 6670e ( the eastern spiral )",
    "there is a bright but fuzzy feature in shorter wavelengths . at nir wavelengths , especially in the @xmath39-band",
    ", it appears more like a part of ngc 6670e s disk .",
    "the different appearance between longer and shorter wavelengths in this region can be due to either dust extinction or a large amount of blue stars . this feature could be a dusty region , or a young stellar tidal feature in the outer disk of ngc 6670e , or a separate dwarf galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the co morphology , co kinematics (   [ coresult ] ) , and radio continuum morphology (   [ 20cmresult ] ) all suggest only two edge - on disks in this system .",
    "it is most likely that the fuzzy feature in the southeast end of ngc 6670e is part of its disk or a young stellar tidal feature .",
    "the western spiral galaxy ( ngc 6670w ) appears to be the more edge - on of the two spiral galaxies . at nir wavelengths a prominent bulge",
    "is evident , while at blue wavelengths the bulge and eastern portion of the disk are barely detected .",
    "this is likely due to dust extinction in the eastern part of the disk .",
    "we note that the heavily obscured region in the eastern part of the disk of ngc 6670w is also the location of the huge concentration ( the `` c concentration , '' see   [ h1 ] ) .",
    "it is possible that this concentration is responsible for the extinction .",
    "the western half of the disk is in general brighter than the eastern half especially at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this may be an indication of recent star formation .",
    "both the eastern and western halves of the disk in ngc 6670w show significant curvature .",
    "this morphology could be attributed to : 1 ) a warped disk , 2 ) a two - armed grand - design spiral with large pitch angle , inclined at nearly perfect edge - on , or 3 ) a tidal perturbation that is nearly in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "in contrast to ngc 6670w , the nuclear region of ngc 6670e is clearly detected in all of the broad - band images .",
    "furthermore , the disk appears less edge - on , with surface brightness variations that differ from one band to the next .",
    "these morphological variations could be attributed to dust extinction and/or massive star formation .",
    "on the other hand , if the emission detected at @xmath33-band traces star formation in the absence of dust , then the star formation in the nuclear region of ngc 6670e is prolific in comparison to the nucleus / bulge of ngc 6670w .",
    "the `` brush - like '' features noted by @xcite can all be attributed to the disks of the two spiral galaxies .",
    "one of these , the eastern portion of ngc 6670w disk , appears to extend to `` touch '' ngc 6670e .",
    "this is most clear in the @xmath39-band image . in all the broad - band images ,",
    "the disks of both ngc 6670e and ngc 6670w are enveloped in a faint `` halo '' of star light .",
    "this `` common envelope , '' the disturbed morphologies of both disks , and the apparent proximity of the disks suggest that the true separation between the two galaxies is not much larger than the projected separation and the galaxies may be interacting . on the other hand , none of these clues , along or together , prove that the two galaxies are interacting , much less in physical contact .        in figure  [ h1moms ] ,",
    "we present the low resolution ( robust weighting ) integrated intensity map and the intensity - weighted velocity map .",
    "figure  [ h1unifmom0 ] shows an enlarged view of the high resolution ( uniform weighting ) integrated intensity . for comparison , co(10 ) integrated intensity",
    "is also plotted in figure  [ h1unifmom0 ] ( see   [ codist ] ) .",
    "several observed quantities are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "a previously unknown long tail is revealed to the west of the stellar disks of ngc 6670 ( hereafter named the `` w tail , '' see fig .",
    "[ h1moms ] ) .",
    "the w tail has a projected extension of @xmath67 kpc from the center between the two galaxies .",
    "furthermore , a smaller tail extends @xmath68 kpc away from ngc 6670 in the northeast direction ( the `` ne tail '' ) .",
    "neither tail has any obvious optical counterparts .",
    "the existence of tidal tails manifests that the galaxies in ngc 6670 are interacting , and are not by chance superposed .",
    "the radial velocity map ( fig .  [ h1moms]b ) and the spectra ( fig .  [ h1spect ] ) show that in ngc 6670 , the largest blueshift ( 8360 km @xmath15 ) appears in the w tail and the largest redshift ( 8820 km @xmath15 ) appears in the ne tail .",
    "the velocity of the whole system increases systemically from the w tail to the ne tail . the velocity dispersion ( cf .",
    "[ h1spect ] and table  [ tab1 ] ) in each tail is relatively small , between 11 km @xmath15 and 17 km @xmath15 .",
    "the velocity of the w tail varies between 8432 and 8366 km @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ h1spect ] ) and the velocity difference between the end and the middle of the w tail is less than 20 km @xmath15 .",
    "the ne tail only appears in the channels of 8825 and 8803 km @xmath15 .",
    "the opposite sense of velocity and the relatively narrow velocity range of the tails in ngc 6670 are very similar to the properties on the tails of the intermediate - stage merger arp 244 ( @xmath69 @xmath70 , @xcite ) and the early - stage merger ngc 4676 ( @xmath69 @xmath71 , @xcite ) . on the other hand , only 25% of ngc",
    "6670 s emission comes from the two tails , in contrast with arp 244 and ngc 4676 which have more than 60% of their distributed along the tails . with the trend found by @xcite that late stage mergers have more outside the stellar disks than early stage mergers , ngc 6670 is most likely in an early stage of interaction",
    "this is consistent with the mild distortion of the disks revealed at optical and nir wavelengths .",
    "the total flux of ngc 6670 ( including the tails ) , obtained by adding all the flux in the low resolution channel maps ( fig .",
    "[ h1chmap ] ) , is 4.83 jy km @xmath15 .",
    "the single dish flux of ngc 6670 measured by @xcite is 4.19 jy km @xmath15 , which is comparable with our results .",
    "their result may be a lower limit because their half - power beam width in the east - west direction ( @xmath72 ) is similar to the source extent and they might have missed parts of the extended tails . in addition , the most recent results of @xcite suggest that the flux in martin et al",
    ". may be systematically lower by up to 30% .",
    "taking this into consideration , we tend to conclude that our vla observation has probably detected almost all of the flux in this system .",
    "the intensity map ( fig .  [ h1moms ] ) shows that most of the in ngc 6670 is around the two separated stellar disks and forms a common halo .",
    "three concentrations of gas can be identified near the stellar disks : the `` w concentration '' in western part of the ngc 6670w disk , the `` c concentration '' between the two galaxies , and the weaker `` e concentration '' in eastern part of the ngc 6670e disk ( fig .",
    "[ h1moms]a and fig .  [ h1unifmom0 ] ) .",
    "all three concentrations are located at the ends of the stellar disks with the c concentration in the `` interaction region '' between the stellar disks .",
    "these three concentrations are also the most remarkable features near the main body of the galaxies in the channel maps ( fig .",
    "[ h1chmap ] ) , especially the c concentration . in the higher resolution map ( fig .",
    "[ h1unifmom0 ] ) , the c concentration is marginally resolved by the @xmath73 beam and appears to extend toward the north - eastern direction .",
    "the compact w concentration remains unresolved in the high resolution map .",
    "the gas mass is estimated using the formula @xcite : @xmath74 where d is the distance in mpc , and @xmath75 is the integrated flux in jy km @xmath15 .",
    "the gas masses of the whole ngc 6670 system , the w tail , and the ne tail obtained from the low resolution channel maps are @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "the mass within the c and w concentrations obtained from the high resolution channel maps is @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "we further estimate the peak and averaged column density in the c and the w concentration in the high resolution integrated intensity map ( made with 1.5 @xmath50 flux clipping ) .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "because the w concentration is unresolved and the c concentration is only slightly larger than the beam , the measured peak column densities should be regarded as lower limits .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ optresults ] , the c concentration is located in the place where the heaviest dust obscuration occurs .",
    "the visual extinction caused by the c concentration can be estimated with the relation @xmath81 . using the peak column density listed in table  [ tab1 ]",
    ", we estimate the visual extinction to be @xmath82 magnitude .",
    "this is a lower limit because individual clouds in the c concentration are unresolved and may have column densities higher than the value used here .",
    "furthermore , molecular gas could also be present .",
    "it seems likely that the c concentration contributes to , if not dominates , the extinction in the eastern portion of the disk of ngc 6670w .",
    "if this is true , the fact that there is not obvious extinction in the western half of the ngc 6670e disk would imply that ngc 6670w is in the background , relative to ngc 6670e .",
    "we will discuss the geometry of this interacting system in details in ",
    "[ interaction2 ] .      in figure  [ pvplots ] , we present position - velocity ( @xmath83-@xmath84 ) diagrams along the major axes of stellar / molecular disks and along a slice joining the two nuclei . for comparison",
    ", we also overlay the co @xmath83-@xmath84 diagrams ( see   [ comotion ] ) along the same slices used for the . on the large scale ,",
    "the motion of near the two stellar disks appears as a single rotating system . unlike in the co @xmath83-@xmath84 diagrams , it is hard to see two distinct systems ( fig .",
    "[ pvplots]c ) .",
    "this is also true in the channel maps ( fig .",
    "[ h1chmap ] ) . in the channel maps , from @xmath85 to 8760 km",
    "@xmath15 , the location of emission changes systematically from the west to the east .",
    "an explanation to this is that the gas originally in the two disks is now merging into a single dynamical system . on the other hand ,",
    "the co velocity field suggests the galaxies have similar spin directions (   [ comotion ] ) .",
    "it is also possible that the apparent global kinematics is just a result caused by chance matching of the velocities of the galaxies .    the near",
    "the disk of ngc 6670w ( figure  [ pvplots]b ) shows a constant velocity gradient over the length of the optical disk ( between @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "the emission along the velocity gradient is weakest near the systemic velocity of ngc 6670w , 8570 km @xmath15 , which is determined by the co velocity field (   [ comotion ] ) .",
    "the stronger emission is located near the ends of the optical disk ( the c and w concentrations ) .",
    "the constant velocity gradient and the edge - brightened morphology in the @xmath83-@xmath84 diagram suggest that the gas is in a rotating ring - like structure around ngc 6670w .",

    "mentioned from tt72 , if there were significant stellar components orbiting either galaxy with radii greater than 0.5 pericentric distance , we should see a stellar tail in this system .",
    "this gives a lower limit for the pericentric distance .",
    "therefore the extent of ngc 6670w s stellar disk in the optical images is the lower limit for the pericentric distance , @xmath149 kpc .",
    "with such a large impact parameter , only the extended disk has formed tails .",
    "this also explains why ngc 6670 has relatively less distributed along the tails compared with other systems like ngc 4676 or arp 244 (   [ h1 ] ) which may have had smaller pericentric distances in their most recent encounters .",
    "we conclude that the difference in appearance between the and stellar - plus - molecular components in ngc 6670 can be ascribed to a relatively large impact parameter and the different initial distribution of those components .",
    "it is worth to point out that the present projected separation of the galaxies ( 16 kpc ) is less than the lower limit of the previous pericentric distance ( 25 kpc ) .",
    "this suggests either that the separation of the galaxies along the line of sight is larger than @xmath150 kpc , or that the galaxies are during their next close encounter which should have a smaller pericentric distance .",
    "the following discussion prefers the second case .",
    "ngc 6670 ( and also ngc 3226/3227 , @xcite ) demonstrates that tails can form independently of stellar tails .",
    "the formation of tails without stellar counterparts might be a common phenomenon for early stage mergers with large pericentric distances .",
    "on the other hand , in this kind of interacting systems , the stellar tails can still form in their later stage of merging .",
    "since the tails and probably also the disrupted dark halo are carrying part of the galaxies angular momentum , the galaxies should have a smaller pericentric distance during their next close encounter than the previous one .",
    "if there are stars located outside the radius of 0.5 pericentric distance during the next encounter , they will likely be ejected to form stellar tails .",
    "it is also possible to form new minor tails during future encounters .",
    "such minor tidal features forming in later encounters can be found in the simulations . due to the different initial distribution of stellar and gaseous components , different tidal features made of stars or gas",
    "could be generated after a few orbital periods . by the same token , the observed offset or morphological inconsistency between stellar and gaseous tails / bridges in many other interacting systems ( e.g. ,",
    "the m81 group , @xcite ; arp 299 , @xcite ) might be explained by the different initial distributions of the different components .",
    "simulations by @xcite had already verified this suggestion .",
    "the interaction age of ngc 6670 can also be estimated if we know the true spatial velocity ( @xmath34 ) of the tails .",
    "given the projected 90 kpc extension of the w tail , the time elapsed since this tail began forming must be at least 90 kpc/@xmath34 .",
    "consider that the tails are escaping particles that became nearly gravitationally unbound to the host galaxies due to the tidal force of the interaction ( tt72 ) .",
    "thus we assume that the escaping particles were not accelerated to higher velocities during the encounter but have velocities comparable to their original velocities prior to the interaction . therefore",
    ", the value of @xmath34 can be estimated as the rotation velocity plus orbital velocity of a galaxy .",
    "we use the value @xmath151 for @xmath34 , where @xmath84 is the rotational velocity of w tail s parent galaxy and @xmath152 is relative radial velocity of the galaxies . given that the rotational velocities of the galaxies are 100 and 170 km @xmath15 and @xmath153 km @xmath15 , the possible @xmath34 ranges between 180 and 250 km @xmath15 .",
    "thus the age of the tail is @xmath154 yr . the age of the tail can perhaps be used to indicate the age of interaction .",
    "similar dating methods were used on other interacting systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the interaction age of the advanced merger arp 299 was estimated to be @xmath155 yr @xcite .",
    "this is almost twice the interaction age of ngc 6670 .",
    "although there is an uncertainty ( probably a factor of 2 ) with this kind of age estimate , it is still plausible that ngc 6670 is in an early stage of merging .",
    "in addition to the age of interaction , we can also estimate the orbital time scale of this system using @xmath156 where @xmath23 is projected nuclear separation and @xmath152 is relative radial velocity between the galaxies . given @xmath157 kpc ,",
    "the orbital time scale is @xmath158 yr .",
    "this time scale is comparable with the interaction age .",
    "it is therefore possible that the second approach of the galaxies are now ongoing if the galaxies are in gravitationally bound orbits .",
    "furthermore , as described in   [ h1 ] , the c concentration may cause the extinction in the eastern side of the disk of ngc 6670w .",
    "this implies that the c concentration is in front of ngc 6670w along the line of sight .",
    "moreover , the lack of obscuration in the western part of ngc 6670e suggests that ngc 6670e is in front of the c concentration and therefore is in front of ngc 6670w .",
    "if this is the case , the galaxies must be approaching to each other because ngc 6670w is blueshifted relative to ngc 6670e .",
    "we can estimate the ratio of the kinetic and potential energies of this system to test whether the two disks are gravitationally bound .",
    "the ratio is @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the reduced mass of the system , @xmath152 is the relative velocity and @xmath23 is the nuclear separation of the galaxies with masses @xmath161 and @xmath162 . for ngc 6670w , we use the dynamical mass , @xmath163 . for ngc 6670e",
    ", we use the luminosity mass @xmath147 as described in ",
    "[ mdyn ] . using the projected nuclear separation ( 16 kpc ) for @xmath23 and the radial velocity difference ( 160 km @xmath15 ) for @xmath152",
    ", we estimate the ratio @xmath164 to be 0.35 . because both @xmath152 and @xmath23 used here are lower limits , this estimate @xmath164 is also a lower limit . although we can not obtain an upper limit for @xmath164 , it is reasonable to conclude that the galaxies are gravitationally bound ( @xmath165 ) for three reasons .",
    "1 ) the masses we use are lower limits because they only include material within the stellar distribution .",
    "the inclusion of material outside the extent of the stellar disks would make the ratio @xmath164 smaller .",
    "2 ) as described in the previous paragraph , the interaction age is comparable with the orbital time scale .",
    "if the galaxies were unbound , they would have a much larger separation than the present projected separation after an orbital time scale since the first encounter .",
    "the relatively small projected separation suggests the galaxies to be bound , unless the separation along the line of sight is very large .",
    "3 ) as suggested by the relative line - of - sight geometry of ngc 6670e , the c concentration , and ngc 6670w , the galaxies are approaching each other again .",
    "this can only happen when the galaxies are gravitationally bound .",
    "in addition , the formula above for @xmath164 can be used to better constrain the galaxies transverse velocities perpendicular to the line of sight . the relative velocity ( @xmath152 ) of the galaxies at the previous pericenter",
    "can be estimated by using the lower limit of the pericentric distance ( 25 kpc ) for @xmath23 and assuming @xmath166 .",
    "the estimated relative velocity is 210 km @xmath15 .",
    "this is slightly larger than the present radial velocity difference of the galaxies ( 160 km @xmath15 ) . because the galaxies relative velocity reached its maximum at the pericenter , the 210 km @xmath15 estimated above must be an upper limit for the present relative velocity",
    "therefore , the observed radial velocity difference suggests that the transverse velocity must be small compared to the radial velocity .",
    "this is consistent with the discussion at the beginning of this section .    in conclusion ,",
    "the galaxies in ngc 6670 are likely in gravitationally bound prograde - prograde orbits with an orbital plane nearly edge - on along the e - w direction .",
    "the galaxies have already passed through a pericenter at least once .",
    "the pericentric distance of the first close encounter is greater than the diameter of each stellar disk , therefore no strong stellar tails were generated during that encounter .",
    "we summarize the discussed orbital geometry in figure  [ cartoon ] .",
    "the above general picture of the interaction in ngc 6670 is self - consistent , but it should be verified by numerical simulations .",
    "our observations reveal a massive atomic gas concentration ( the c concentration ) in the overlap region between the two stellar disks .",
    "the c concentration has an mass of @xmath167 . in some systems of intermediate merging stage such as arp 244 @xcite , arp 299 @xcite , and ngc 6090 @xcite ,",
    "co images reveal massive molecular gas reservoirs ( @xmath168 ) in the disk overlap regions which seem to be the most active star forming areas and could dominate the overall starburst activity @xcite .    as indicated in ",
    "[ h1motion ] , the velocities of the e and w concentrations match the co velocities of the eastern side of ngc 6670e and the western side of ngc 6670w , respectively .",
    "this suggests that these two concentrations are remnants of the outer disks of the galaxies and still have velocities similar to the rotation velocities of the inner disks .",
    "in contrast , figure  [ pvplots ] shows that the c concentration has a velocity range between the co velocities of the western side of ngc 6670e and the eastern side of ngc 6670w .",
    "the spatial location and anomalous velocity of the c concentration could be explained by either direct cloud - cloud collisions of between the prograde - prograde disks , or a superposition of two independent components whose velocities are slowed down by the tidal potential (   [ h1motion ] ) .",
    "we note that , even for the second case , cloud - cloud collisions may still take place in the future because the galaxies are now approaching each other .",
    "@xcite showed that cloud - cloud collisions in colliding galaxies can produce a hot ionized over - pressure remnant gas to compress the gmcs and lead to starbursts in off - nuclear regions",
    ". the observed concentration of between the two disks of ngc 6670 may provide support to the starburst mechanism proposed by @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations do not generally produce gas concentrations in the disk overlap regions during the early or intermediate stages of merging ( arp 244 for example , @xcite ) .",
    "our observations of ngc 6670 provide a possible evolutionary link to the intermediate - stage mergers with molecular gas concentration in the disk overlap regions , like in arp 244 , arp 299 and ngc 6090 .",
    "the c concentration in ngc 6670 has an gas mass comparable to the molecular concentrations found in the disk overlap regions of other lirgs . knowing that the c concentration is massive and the galaxies are still approaching each other",
    ", we expect that during the future interaction , more gas ( and even molecular gas ) will flow into this region and get trapped .",
    "after the gas density increases , a conversion of into @xmath95 may occur .",
    "it is possible that the c concentration is the progenitor of the molecular concentration in the disk overlap regions observed in some late stage lirgs .",
    "both galaxies in ngc 6670 have signatures which are anticipated by numerical simulations to be important for fueling the nuclear starbursts .",
    "our bima co observations reveal that the molecular gas in ngc 6670e is concentrated toward its nuclear region .",
    "a molecular bar is suggested in the center of ngc 6670w via the co @xmath83-@xmath84 diagram ( fig .  [ pvplots]b ) , which can efficiently drive gas into the nuclear region @xcite .",
    "the ir luminosity of ngc 6670 , of @xmath19 implies a high star formation rate of many tens of solar masses per year .",
    "furthermore , the total molecular gas mass revealed by our observations is also high ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "however , it is possible that the gmcs of ngc 6670 are forming stars with an efficiency similar to the gmcs in the galactic disk .",
    "if this is the case , the high infrared luminosity of ngc 6670 would be merely due to the large reservoirs of molecular gas , similar to the nonstarburst lirg arp 302 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to determine whether the star formation activity in the large molecular reservoirs of ngc 6670 are really elevated to starburst levels .",
    "there are several ways to probe starbursts .",
    "if the infrared luminosity is entirely due to dust heated by recent star formation , the star formation rate ( sfr ) would be directly proportional to the infrared luminosity .",
    "various conversions between infrared luminosity and star formation rate have been suggested , from sfr ( @xmath104 @xmath170 ) @xmath171 to 300 @xmath172 @xmath4(@xmath173 ) @xcite .",
    "thus the global star formation rate for ngc 6670 is @xmath174 to 120 @xmath104 @xmath170 .",
    "this implies a molecular gas depletion time between @xmath175 and @xmath176 yr , comparable with the orbital time scale of ngc 6670 and the typical galaxy - galaxy merging time scale for gas - rich mergers demonstrated in most simulations .",
    "the ratio @xmath177 is often used to indicate the star formation efficiency ( sfr per unit molecular gas mass ) .",
    "the mean sfe for the gmcs in the milky way s disk is @xmath178 @xmath2 @xcite . for nearby starburst galaxies ,",
    "the value of sfe is @xmath179 @xmath2 @xcite . for nuclear starburst regions in lirgs ,",
    "the sfe ranges from 20 to greater than 100 @xmath2 @xcite .",

    "can be applied to the individual galaxies of ngc 6670 .",
    "this should be a good approximation for ngc 6670 because we have shown that the system as a whole obeys the fir ",
    "radio correlation and that the radio continuum emission of ngc 6670 is not from agn activity (   [ 20cmresult ] ) . after scaling the infrared luminosity with the 20 cm flux density ( table  [ tab2 ] ) , we find an sfe of 12.7 @xmath2 for ngc 6670e and 8.8 @xmath2 for ngc 6670w .",
    "the sfe of ngc 6670e is significantly higher than that of the gmcs in the galactic disk but is not as high as the sfe of nuclear starbursts in lirgs .    in normal galaxies , the fir ",
    "radio correlation appears to hold locally within individual galaxies and the fir and radio morphologies are similar @xcite .",
    "this is also the case in ngc 6670 , as the radio continuum and mid - infrared morphology observed by iso are similar @xcite .",
    "if we assume the distribution of fir emission is similar to that of the radio continuum , the strong radio emission from the nuclei of ngc 6670 would imply that the nuclear regions are the sites of current star formation activity .",
    "we plot one - dimensional profiles of 20 cm flux density and co integrated intensity along the major axes of the two disks in figure  [ profiles ] .",
    "it shows that the ratio of 20 cm flux density to co integrated intensity is significantly higher in the center of ngc 6670e compared to other regions in ngc 6670e or ngc 6670w .",
    "thus , the sfe in the center of ngc 6670e is higher than the mean sfe of ngc 6670e or the whole ngc 6670 system .    to quantify the sfe in the nuclear regions , we use two methods to estimate the 20 cm and co flux from the central regions .",
    "1 ) we fit the nuclear components of both galaxies in the high resolution co integrated intensity map and the 20 cm map with 2d gaussians . using this method",
    ", we obtain sfes of 17 and 10 @xmath2 for the nuclear regions of ngc 6670e and ngc 6670w , respectively .",
    "2 ) we directly sum the pixels within the inner 4 kpc ( @xmath180 ) regions of both galaxies in the 20 cm map and the high resolution co intensity map to obtain the flux .",
    "the resulting sfe is 18 @xmath2 for the nucleus of ngc 6670e and 11 for the nucleus of ngc 6670w .",
    "table  [ tab3 ] summarizes the parameters given by the two methods described above .",
    "the sfe estimated above is likely to be a lower limit , since the molecular mass may be over - estimated by using a co - to-@xmath95 conversion factor @xmath181 derived from the milky way disk (   [ codist ] ) . we conclude that the nucleus of ngc 6670e is a starburst region and its star formation efficiency is at least four times higher than that of the gmcs in the milky way disk .",
    "we can calculate the peak co brightness temperature ( @xmath182 ) using the channel maps . in order to minimize the effect of beam dilution , we use the highest resolution maps which include b array data only . for a @xmath183 ( @xmath184 kpc ) beam ,",
    "the highest co brightness in ngc 6670e appears in its center , in the channel of @xmath185 km @xmath15 .",
    "this brightest component is unresolved and has a peak brightness temperature of 4.5 k. in ngc 6670w , several peaks with @xmath182 of 3 to 3.5 k appear in the disk and we can not distinguish an isolated peak in its center . in the starburst galaxy m82 , the molecular clouds smaller than 100 pc",
    "have @xmath182 ranging from 13 to 34 k @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "the highest @xmath182 observed by @xcite with a @xmath186 single dish beam ( @xmath82 kpc ) on m82 is 0.6 k. the single dish beam size of @xcite is comparable with the synthesis beam used here for ngc 6670 . compared with those m82 data , the brightness temperature in the center of ngc 6670e and ngc 6670w is unusually high .",
    "although our resolution is insufficient to resolve individual clouds , this still suggests that the molecular clouds in the centers of both ngc 6670e and ngc 6670w are very bright and may have properties similar to the clouds in the starburst regions of m82 .",
    "we estimate the average infrared surface brightness of the nuclear regions using the fir  radio correlation to scale the ir emission with 20 cm radio continuum flux . assuming that all the nuclear 20 cm flux given by the gaussian fit comes from the area within one full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm , see table  [ tab3 ] )",

    ". the typical ir surface brightness of resolved starburst regions of few hundred pc sizes in m82 , ngc 253 and other lirgs is @xmath190 @xmath173 @xmath107 ( see @xcite for a summary ) . in the orion molecular cloud ( omc 1 ) near the trapezium , the mean radiation field strength is @xmath191 @xmath173 @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "the mean values for the inner parts of ngc 6670 are roughly 10 times smaller . because our 20 cm beam size ( @xmath189 kpc ) is several times larger than the sizes of other resolved starbursts ( @xmath192 kpc ) , the fwhms given by the fitting are clearly upper limits for the sizes of the nuclear star forming regions in ngc 6670 .",
    "therefore , the mean value of @xmath193 @xmath173 @xmath107 obtained over @xmath189 kpc scale is high and the ir surface brightness in the nuclear regions of ngc 6670 may be comparable with those in other starburst regions .    the measured co brightness temperature and ir surface brightness are both largely limited by the resolution and only represent lower bounds to the actual values .",
    "however , they qualitatively provide tests on the molecular gas properties and the radiation flux coming from young massive stars .",
    "they both indicate that the nuclei of ngc 6670e and ngc 6670w are undergoing higher than normal levels of star formation , perhaps even at the level of starbursts .",

    "the low resolution integrated intensity map and velocity map of cgcg 301 - 032 are plotted in figure  [ cgcgmoms ] .",
    "there is no detected between ngc 6670 and cgcg 301 - 032 under the current detection limit .",
    "the integrated flux of cgcg 301 - 032 obtained from the low resolution channel maps is 1.6 jy km @xmath15 and indicates the total gas mass to be @xmath206 .",
    "the extent of the hi gas is about 30 kpc .",
    "the galaxy s velocity gradient along ne - sw direction shows that the of cgcg 301 - 032 is in a rotating disk .",
    "the large amount of atomic gas and the rotating feature suggest that cgcg 301 - 032 is a relatively small ( 12 kpc in optical extent ) early - type spiral galaxy .",

    "<S> we present high resolution 21 cm line , 20 cm radio continuum , and co(10 ) line observations of the luminous infrared galaxy ngc 6670 . </S>",
    "<S> ngc 6670 consists of two edge - on disk galaxies ( ngc 6670e and ngc 6670w ) with a projected nuclear separation of @xmath0 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> while there are no optically identified tidal features and the molecular disks are not distorted much , we have detected a 90 kpc long tail which suggests that the galaxies are interacting and have already experienced at least one close encounter . the galaxies appear to be gravitationally bound and in a prograde - prograde orbit , which is the most efficient for producing tidal tails . </S>",
    "<S> our observations suggest that the at larger galactic radii has been ejected to form the tails and the remnant disks have been perturbed by the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that the disk of ngc 6670e appears to have been nearly destroyed . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the previous encounter between the galaxies had a large impact parameter and that the system is still in an early stage of interaction .    even though ngc 6670 is in an early stage of interaction , we find that there is evidence for nuclear starbursts already present . </S>",
    "<S> the co(10 ) observations show large molecular gas reservoirs in the central regions and the 20 cm radio continuum observations reveal enhanced star formation activity in the nuclear regions of both galaxies . the spatial extent of the 20 cm emission and the fir - radio correlation further rule out active galactic nuclei as the source of the ir luminosity from ngc 6670 . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the ratio @xmath1 , which is often used as an indicator of star formation efficiency , in the nuclear regions of ngc 6670e and ngc 6670w to be 18 and 11 @xmath2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear star formation efficiency of these two galaxies has been elevated to the level observed in other nearby starburst galaxies ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> other indicators of starburst activity such as co brightness temperature and infrared surface brightness are also observed . </S>"
