    "in addition , the dipole - loop pair is investigated in @xcite . since both the electric field and magnetic field have three components in the cartesian coordinate system , a dipole - triad @xcite comprises three orthogonally - collocated dipoles which are used to measure the three components of the signal s electric field , and a loop - triad @xcite comprises three orthogonally - collocated loops which are used to measure the three components of the signal s magnetic field .",
    "when the dipole triad and the loop triad are collocated at a point geometry in space , an electromagnetic vector - sensor @xcite will be constructed .",
    "advantages of these dipole / loop pair , triad , and electromagnetic vector - sensor are that they can resolve both the polarization and the direction - of - arrival ( doa ) differences of the incident sources @xcite .",
    "because all antennas in the vector - sensor are collocated , they will have the same frequency - dependence .",

    "advantages of the non - collocating electromagnetic vector sensor include that @xcite : 1 ) the mutual coupling is effectively reduced since the inter - sensor spacings are far larger than a half - wavelength , 2 ) the angular resolution is enhanced because of the array aperture extension , and 3 ) the vector - cross - product direction finding approach is remained for fast doa estimation .",
