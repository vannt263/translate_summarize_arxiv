    "i , the extension of the continuum percolation results obtained for overlapping hyperspheres and oriented hypercubes to cases in which the overlapping hyperparticles are nonspherical ( anisotropic in shape ) with some specified orientation distribution function ( e.g. , random orientations ) was briefly discussed .",

    "the exploration of the generalizations of the techniques of this series of papers to bound percolation thresholds in the lattice setting @xcite ( bond and site percolation @xcite ) represents an intriguing area for future research .",

    "we derived the approximation ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) for @xmath55 , which immediately leads to the approximation ( [ rho_c ] ) for @xmath49 and thus , the approximation ( [ pb ] ) for the contact values of the blocking function @xmath96 and pair connectedness function @xmath147 .    in this appendix , we compare the approximation ( [ rho_c ] ) for @xmath49 versus @xmath12 with available numerical data for overlapping spheres in @xmath107 .",

    "[ fig_rho ] . observe that the approximation agrees with the simulation data very well and bounds the data from below .",
    "since the approximation ( [ rho_c ] ) for @xmath49 improves as the space dimension increases beyond three , we expect that results derived from it , such as the relation ( [ pb ] ) for the blocking function and pair connectedness function at contact , will provide accurate approximations across dimensions for @xmath148 . in particular , we provide plots of the contact values @xmath96 and @xmath149 [ as predicted by ( [ pb ] ) ] versus @xmath12 for overlapping hyperspheres in dimensions @xmath150 and @xmath151 up to the respective percolation thresholds in figs .",

    "the total correlation function @xmath13 generally takes on both negative and positive values depending on the values of the radial distance @xmath11 and reduced density @xmath12 .",
    "one can think of the duality relation ( [ dual ] ) as the mapping that is required to convert a correlation function for a hard - particle system to a non - negative pair connectedness function ( bounded from above by unity ) for the corresponding overlapping particle system ."
