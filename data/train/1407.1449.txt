    "initial compositions of such stars are revealed by those observable elements least likely to condense out into grains : c , n , o , s and zn , with the additional recognition that c , n , and o are very probably altered by internal mixing during the course of stellar evolution .",
    "for example , @xcite reported that hr4049 has [ fe / h ] = @xmath19 , but [ s / h ] = @xmath20 and [ zn / h ] = @xmath21 .",
    "these latter abundances suggested an initial composition closer to [ fe / h ] = @xmath22 for which unevolved , normal stars have [ s / fe ] = + 0.4 and [ zn / fe ] = 0 .",
    "thus , the current compositions of these chemically peculiar stars reflect that of gas from which refractory elements have been removed to varying degrees by the process of ` dust - gas winnowing ' @xcite .  in gas of sufficiently low temperature , dust condenses out and the gas is depleted in those elements that form the dust . the local interstellar gas , for example , displays such depletions @xcite .",
    "if a star were to accrete gas ( or re - accrete gas , if the separation occurs in a circumstellar disk / shell ) , preferentially over dust , and the accreted gas were to comprise a major fraction of the stellar atmosphere , then the star will exhibit striking abundance anomalies",

    "these stars occupy significantly different parts of the hr - diagram and , therefore , associated properties of affected stars , such as age , mass , binarity , or evolutionary status , do not appear to be uniform across the cases .",
    "details in the observed elemental abundance patterns vary between the cases as well , possibly due to differences in the stellar parameters ( e.g.  temperature , gravity ) , the stellar atmospheres ( e.g.  convection , mixing ) , or perhaps due to the dust - gas winnowing mechanism itself .  the principal common features linking these post - agb and main sequence stars are the presence of dust and a thin outer envelope .",
    "a comparison of the hmp stars he1327 - 2326 and he0107 - 5240 , as well as he0557 - 4840 , to samples of these chemically peculiar stars led @xcite to speculate on the question of whether the hmp stars may themselves be chemically peculiar .  while @xcite left the question unresolved , @xcite , who also considered the possibility of selective dust depletion for e0107 - 5240 , sided against the possibility due to a high c / n ratio and unknown pulsation or binary properties typically seen in the chemically peculiar stars ; however , they also suggested that the zn and s abundances should be investigated as volatile elements that do not easily condense onto dust grains .",
    "this test was initiated for he1327 - 2326 , when @xcite attempted to determine its sulphur abundance  unfortunately , the upper limit determined for sulphur was inconclusive regarding the likelihood of dust formation affecting the surficial chemical abundance ratios .",
    "@xcite also noted that dust formation and supernova yields with extensive fall - back are not mutually exclusive ( nor is an alteration to c / n due to convective mixing ) such that the abundance ratios in the hmp stars could be affected by more than one mechanism .    if the hmp stars are , in fact , chemically peculiar stars , i.e.  normal stars that have had their chemical abundances altered by dust - gas winnowing , then their initial abundances would have been higher",
    "( [ fe / h ] @xmath23 @xmath24 to @xmath25 , based on their cno and na abundances ) .",
    "this would make them typical metal poor stars , although ones that have undergone a rare process .",
    "the dust removed / not accreted in their atmospheres should then be present in a disk or shell outside the stellar envelope .  therefore",
    ", another test of the dust - gas separation hypothesis is to search for the presence of circumstellar dust , e.g.  to search for an infrared excess in these stars .",

    "however , the presence of circumstellar material can be difficult to detect and is often inconclusive from @xmath27 magnitudes alone , e.g.",
    "some post - agb and chemically peculiar lambda bootis stars only show ir excesses beyond 2.2 microns as discussed below .    to further explore the possibility that the hmp stars have been affected by dust - gas winnowing",

    "the observed fluxes were scaled to match the model fluxes best in the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 filters ; the scale factor is equivalent to the ratio of ( distance / radius)@xmath35 .  for smss0313 - 6708 and",

    "no reddening corrections are assumed for smss0313 - 6708 , which may affect the @xmath36-band flux determination but has no significant impact on the ir fluxes .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig : sedbig ] shows that with one possible exception the long - wavelength tail of the seds out to about 10 microns is dominated by the contribution from the star and a dust signature is not detected .",
    "the possible exception is he0107 - 5240 , where the wise w3 flux at 11.6 microns is marginally greater than that predicted for this star ; a close - up view of its mid - ir flux shows the excess is no more than 2 @xmath3 of the error in the w3 flux for this star as reported in the wise all sky survey , and warrants deeper observations .  if thermal emission from a dusty disk peaks at this wavelength , the implied temperature would be @xmath37k .",
    "further inspection of the wise w2 4.6 micron flux for sdss j1029 + 1729 , is also intriguing , possibly suggesting a slight upturn from the predicted flux for this star ; however , the wise w3 and w4 magnitudes provide only upper limits that do not further constrain its fluxes .",
    "small ( 1 @xmath3 ) differences in the model atmosphere parameters have no significant effect on the overall comparisons .",

    "it is worth noting that bd+39  4926 had been thought to be free of ir emission @xcite , which is unusual given the strong chemical anomalies that are consistent with the dust - gas winnowing signature .",
    "however , the new wise data presented here reach deeper magnitudes and reveal the mid - ir excess that clearly accompanies this star beyond 10 microns .",
    "_ this further implies that the ir excess of a star that has undergone dust - gas winnowing does not correlate with the strength of the chemical anomalies_.  the formation , evolution , and detection of a debris disk is a delicate balance between temperature and radius , mass and density , composition and emissivity , and especially age of formation and time for dispersal  all relative to the conditions in the stellar atmosphere , where the chemical anomalies form , but can also be erased through convective mixing with the stellar interior .",

    "the main questions in this paper are whether the hmp stars have debris disks , and whether the formation of a debris disk has affected the chemical abundances in their stellar atmospheres .",
    "ascertaining the integrity of the hmp stars as old and intrinsically metal poor is important since these stars are used as benchmarks for the earliest stages of chemical evolution in the galaxy , and therefore as constraints for yields from the earliest supernova .",
    "detection of debris disks is challenging , although the new mid - ir ground - based ( alma ) and space - based ( herschel , wise ) telescopes have made significant improvements .",
    "emission from a debris disk depends on two parameters in a simple one zone model  dust temperature and fractional luminosity @xcite .",
    "fractional luminosity depends on the ratio of fluxes , disk vs.  star at their respective blackbody peak wavelengths , thus , f = ( f@xmath41 / f@xmath42)/(@xmath43/@xmath44 ) .",
    "if the disk flux density were to peak at 10 microns , the lack of a detection in the @xmath29 band or wise w3 band will limit the flux ratio between debris disk and host star to f @xmath45 .",
    "this also limits the distance to the inner radius of a potential debris disk from a host star ( with @xmath46k ) to @xmath47 au .",
    "these numbers are similar to those for close - in a - star disks @xcite , e.g. , @xmath48 lep hosts a dusty disk with @xmath49k that is detected only beyond 2au @xcite .",
    "observations taken with the herschel telescope of debris disks have been carried out for a - type stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the debris survey ) and fgk stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the dunes survey ) .",
    "detection limits for the herschel pacs ( photodetecting array camera and spectrometer ) were flux ratios f = 10@xmath50 for @xmath51k , and f = 10@xmath52 for @xmath53k .  given these limits , it is interesting that nearly all of the fgk stars with detected debris disks are within @xmath54 pc , and constitute @xmath231/4 of their sample .",
    "a - type stars with debris disks were detected to 40pc , and have cool dust temperatures ( @xmath55k ) and small sizes ( @xmath56 au ) , similar to the @xmath48 lep example above .  while herschel observations are at 70 , 100 , and 160 microns , sed comparisons to the observations imply there would be very little mid - ir emission even at 20 microns in most of these systems .",
    "the hmp and other stars in this paper are much farther than those in the dunes and debris surveys ( 1 to 10kpc , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore are below the herschel detection limits .",
    "thus , it remains a challenge to detect cool debris disks in these systems with the exquisite detail of other herschel survey targets , even if debris disks are present .",
    "nevertheless , the question is whether formation of these debris disks could affect the stellar chemistry .",
    "we address this issue in the next section .      the strongest evidence for the chemical anomalies that accompany dust - gas winnowing comes from the detailed abundance analysis of the atmosphere of a star for which the composition can be inferred _ in the absence of dust - gas winnowing .",
    "_ this inference is possible for lambda bootis stars , post - agb stars and rv tauri variables because ( i ) a wide range of elemental abundances are available for these stars , particularly over a broad range in the condensation temperature , and ( ii ) the compositions of _ normal _ dwarfs and giants of comparable metallicity span a small range in element abundance ratios , i.e.  @xmath57[x / fe ] at given metallicity is small and therefore the magnitude of an abundance anomaly can be directly inferred despite a lack of knowledge of the star s original or intrinsic composition .",
    "unfortunately , this satisfactory state hardly applies to the hmp stars because ( i ) elemental abundances are available for only a few elements , ( ii ) key elements such as s and zn provide few or no lines in their optical spectra , and most importantly ( iii ) at extremely low metallicities there are strong star - to - star differences which confuses our ability to identify chemical peculiarities from intrinsic properties .    if dust - gas winnowing is influencing the atmospheric composition of the hmp stars , then this mechanism not only predicts the presence of a dusty debris disk , circumstellar shell , or stellar wind , but it also requires ( i ) a mechanism such as differential radiation pressure between dust grains and gas enabling the atmosphere to accrete gas preferentially over dust , and ( ii ) a shallow atmosphere that is effectively unmixed with the convective envelope below .",
    "therefore , a theoretical estimate of the mass of the dust - free envelope mixed with the normal stellar atmosphere is a key factor ; e.g.  @xmath58 more dust - free gas is needed to reduce the [ fe / h ] metallicity by 2  dex .",
    "however , operation of the dust - gas winnowing mechanism is also governed by certain timescales .  for example , if the dust reservoir is exhausted or eliminated , a dust - gas winnowing chemical signature could remain without detectable dusty debris .  alternatively , a debris disk or circumstellar dust envelope could last longer than chemical anomalies if rapid mixing with the deeper convective envelope erases the chemical signatures in the atmosphere .",
    "the case of the lambda bootis stars highlights this latter scenario .",
    "a study of 24 dusty a - stars by @xcite found that only one showed a clear chemically peculiar abundance pattern .",
    "thus , the presence of a debris disk indicated by a mid - ir excess is not a sufficient condition for operation of dust - gas winnowing affecting the chemical abundances in a stellar atmosphere .",
    "theoretical studies have suggested that the effects of dust - gas winnowing may last only @xmath59 years @xcite .    at the heart of the phenomenon",
    "is the presence of a thin radiative outer zone , where the composition can be influenced greatly by the accretion of a modest amount of dust - free gas .",
    "the effective temperature of the main sequence lambda bootis stars ensures a thin outer radiative zone ; post - agb stars within the instability strip , such as the rv tauri variables , as well as those bluewards of that strip , also have thin envelopes .",
    "detailed examination of the rv tauri variables ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have found ( i ) the dust - gas winnowing is only observed in stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath60 , presumably because radiation pressure on the few grains of lower metallicity stars are unable to sustain the separation of dust from gas , and ( ii ) the phenomenon is only observed in stars hotter than 5000k , presumably because the atmospheres of cooler stars have deep convective envelope that would erase the signature .",
    "as demonstrated in section  2.2 , for stars that do undergo dust - gas winnowing , the strength of the infrared excess is uncorrelated with the chemically peculiar abundance pattern , as with the lambda bootis stars , showing that a dusty reservoir is not a sufficient condition .",
    "cumulative indirect evidence for dust - gas winnowing affecting the hmp stars is therefore not encouraging .",
    "as this paper shows , lack of a mid - ir excess appears to be common .",
    "the intrinsic metallicity , even if taken from c , n , and o abundances , is at least 1 dex below the limit suggested from rv tauri variables ( and the lambda bootis stars ) .",
    "many of the hmp stars are giants , with convective envelopes that would quickly erase most changes to the surface chemistry ; the convective envelopes would also hamper the establishment of abundance anomalies through dust - gas winnowing in the first place .  even if a young hmp star experiences an episode of dust - gas winnowing _",
    "early _ in its life , signatures from this episode should be erased over the long lifetime of the star .",
    "nevertheless , given the great diversity already exhibited by the five known hmp dwarf and giant stars , it may be that a star is found with a surface composition that is dominated not by ejecta from a first generation of stars but by the local operation of dust - gas winnowing .",
    "the question is whether we have yet found that star , which we address in the next section .",
    "finally , we note that the [ mg / fe ] ratio is also an interesting abundance ratio for this discussion .",
    "since mg and fe have very similar condensation temperatures , then hmp stars like smss0313 - 6708 with very high [ mg / fe ] ratios @xcite can not be dominated by the effects of dust - gas winnowing .  in the case of smss0313 - 6708 , the high ratios of [ c / mg ] and [ mg / ca ] further favour formation from gas enriched by faint supernovae in the early interstellar medium due to differentiation in the progenitor core and a mass cut for fall back .",
    "in this paper , we show a marginal ( 2 @xmath3 ) detection of a mid - ir excess near 10 microns associated with the star he0107 - 5240 .",
    "if this excess is real and due to thermal emission from a dusty circumstellar disk or shell , then a substantial amount of dust would need to be present given the distance to the star of 9620pc @xcite ; this is @xmath61 further than the stars in the herschel telescope debris surveys ( @xmath54pc , described above ) .  the cause of the mid - ir excess",
    "( if real ) is not clear ; possibilities include ( i ) dust - gas winnowing , ( ii ) unassociated emission from the foreground interstellar medium , or perhaps ( iii ) effects in a binary system .",
    "dust - gas winnowing does predicts an ir excess associated with stars where the mechanism operates ( a prediction which motivated this paper ) , however this is clearly an uncommon occurrence in the hmp stars and can not account for the chemical abundance anomalies of the entire class .",
    "if dust - gas winnowing has occurred in he0107 - 5240 , then it must have been a local and recent phenomenon ( e.g.  a shock to the circumstellar envelope during passage through a dense portion of the interstellar medium as proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "even then it is difficult to understand how dust - gas winnowing would work in a very metal poor star with [ fe / h ]  @xmath62 .",
    "unassociated emission from the foreground interstellar medium could cause broad non - thermal emission bands between 3 and 20 microns .",
    "@xcite have studied broad emission features seen in the infrared spectra ( from iso , the infrared space observatory ) of planetary nebulae , proto - planetary nebulae , photodissociation regions , and novae .",
    "a number of aromatic and aliphatic organic ( c - based ) compounds can cause these broad emission bands , with two particularly strong bands centered near 8 and 12 microns .",
    "again , given the distance to he0107 - 5240 , then it seems unlikely that these features would be associated with that stellar environment , although its c - rich chemistry would provide the basis for the formation of these complex organic molecules .",
    "finally , we notice that the dust - gas winnowing mechanism tends to occur in binary systems ; the post - agb stars are all spectroscopic binaries , and most ( if not all ) of the rv tauri variables are binaries @xcite ; however , it is unclear how binarity plays a role in the lambda bootis phenomenon ( if at all , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a binary system can provide the stability necessary to form a long - lived debris disk  in an examination of the chemical properties of the hmp stars he0107 - 5240 and he1327 - 2326 , @xcite proposed that these stars could form from gas enriched by a primordial faint supernova , from gas enriched by a core - collapse supernova and c - rich gas ejected from the winds of massive stars , and/or as the low - mass secondaries in hyper metal poor binary systems , where they acquire their light - element enhancements from mass transfer when the companion passes through the agb phase .  following on the latter suggestion , the very low abundance of li ( and high sr ) in he1327 - 2326",
    "does favor the binary mass - transfer hypothesis ; i.e.  in a typical agb star , li is destroyed through convective mixing , c is enhanced after the third dredge up , and sr is enhanced through the s - process during the thermal pulsing stage , thus a low mass star that is c - rich , li - poor , and sr - enhanced is consistent with one that has been polluted by agb mass transfer in a binary system .",
    "the li abundance in he1327 - 2326 is well below the spite plateau and primordial abundance from big bang nucleosynthesis , which is surprising for a dwarf or sub - giant star with @xmath63  @xmath64k @xcite .  the low li abundance in he0107 - 5240 is more complicated to interpret since it may have depleted its own li during its evolution up the red giant branch .  therefore , if the mid - ir excess in he0107 - 5240 is real , it may indicate a debris disk formed in a binary system , and could indicate that some c - rich hmp stars are the predicted low mass , low metallicity stars that form in binaries .",
    "this also implies that the c - normal metal - poor star sdss j1029 + 1729  may be different if it has formed in isolation .",
    "we present the mid - ir fluxes of the hmp and other metal - poor stars compared with predictions from standard stellar model atmospheres to test for the presence of a dusty circumstellar environment .",
    "no mid - ir excesses are found for four out of five stars , ruling out may types of circumstellar disks .",
    "we discuss the mid - ir excesses that are found associated with chemically peculiar stars in terms of dust - gas winnowing , and conclude that there is no evidence that dust - gas winnowing dominates the chemical abundance patterns of the hmp stars .",
    "only he0107 - 5240 shows a marginal ( 2 @xmath3 ) excess near 10 microns .",
    "if the mid - ir excess is real and associated with he0107 - 5240 ( and not interstellar emission along the line of sight ) , we propose this may indicate a local and recent phenomenon leading to some dust - gas winnowing or the presence of a binary system .",

    "the pixel scale was 0.09  per pixel . to cancel out the background radiation ,",
    "the secondary mirror chopping and the telescope nodding method were used .",
    "we used four standard stars ( hd720 , hd14641 , hd26967 , and hd40808 ) from @xcite as flux calibrators and reference point spread functions .",
    "one standard star was observed before a science target , followed by one after , to ensure they were taken under similar observing conditions and at similar air masses .",
    "the gemini t - recs integration time calculator ( itc ) was used to estimate the exposure times ;  given the target @xmath26-band magnitudes , atmospheric temperatures , and an atlas9 model atmosphere , then 30-minute exposures were determined for the science targets .",
    "the standard gemini reduction package mid - ir was used within iraf .",
    "simple averaging of the stacked images was used in the mistack task to co - add the chopped and nodded frames .    for he0107 - 5240 ,",
    "the standard stars hd720 and hd14641 were observed before and after the science observation .",
    "each standard star was measured using the iraf task imexamine to determine the flux and fwhm as listed in table  [ tab : obs ] within an aperture radius of 15 pixels , a buffer of 10 pixels and a sky annulus width of 25 pixels .",
    "using the known flux density at 10.2 microns of the standard stars ( interpolated from the mid - ir fluxes on the gemini webpages , also @xcite ;  listed in table  a1 ) , a conversion factor of @xmath66 jy / adu was determined .",
    "the flux of standard star hd14641 was measured using the same aperture .",
    "the conversion factor determined for hd720 was then applied to hd14641 , which yields a flux density of 6.59 jy , in excellent agreement with the known flux of 6.59 jy ( see table a1 ) .",

    "the mean value of the counts in this aperture was 10.75 adu _ per pixel _ , with a standard deviation of 13.25 adu .",
    "the mean value was multiplied by the number of pixels and converted to flux by the factor found above for the standard stars .",
    "this mean value was then scaled by the exposure time ratio ( 28.9585 sec/1853.34 sec ) .",
    "the flux density upper limit for he0107 - 5240 is then 0.33 mjy .",
    "this was converted to a magnitude by using the known zero magnitude flux density of 38.5 jy from the gemini flux density / magnitude conversion tool , giving an apparent n magnitude upper limit of ,      the same procedure was followed for he0557 - 4840 , using hd26967 and hd40808 as standard stars ( see table  a1 ) .",
    "the mean value per pixel in the @xmath29-band image of he0557 - 4840 was 6.40 adu .",
    "small differences between the jy / adu conversion factor determinations for the standard stars meant that we applied @xmath80 jy / adu to the he0557 - 4840 data .",
    "also , the sharp image profiles of the standard stars may have been due to variable seeing during the observations , therefore we adopt the more conservative fwhm = 5.04 pixels determined from he0107 - 5240 for the calculation of the flux density limit for he0557 - 4840 .  as above , this was converted to an @xmath29-band magnitude of ,        due to very low background levels for the standard star exposures ( typically 50 adu ) , the uncertainties in their flux density values are dominated by the calibration of the spectral irradiance values estimated as @xmath82 by @xcite , combined with the mid - ir filter set estimated to be on the order of @xmath83 2% by gemini s online resource page .",
    "no air mass corrections were applied since the standard stars and science targets were all observed at approximately the same air mass .",
    "no color - temperature correction terms were applied either since the standard stars have similar temperatures as the science targets , in the range of 3800 - 5000k ( spectral types of the standard stars are in table  a1 ) .",
