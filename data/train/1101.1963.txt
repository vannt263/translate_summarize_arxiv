    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is likely to accumulate significant amounts of data in 2011 . while the detector groups will be sensitive to many ways new physics",
    "could appear , it is not possible to focus equally on all possible interesting signatures , so it is valuable to examine well - motivated channels that may yield results at the initial lhc energies and luminosities . in recent years",
    "it has increasingly been recognized that considerations of new physics point toward top - quark and bottom - quark rich final states at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , as naturalness of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) typically requires the existence of a top partner to cancel the quadratic divergences in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "supersymmetry implies the existence of a top partner that cancels quadratic divergences .",
    "supersymmetry also introduces a partner for the gluon , the gluino , in the low energy spectrum . at proton colliders , pair production of gluinos , and",
    "consequently their decay products , typically become the main channel of supersymmetric signals .",
    "models with light top partners , are common and they imply that a typical signature of production of the gluino will be multiple top quarks in the final states @xcite .    in the rest of this paper , we will study this signature of low energy supersymmetry with light gluinos , focusing on the well - motivated scenario in which the squarks are considerably heavier than the gluino and the third generation squarks are lighter than those of the first two generations . in this case , the gluino will dominantly decay into top and/or bottom quarks .",
    "earlier some of us , along with acharya , grajek , and suruliz @xcite studied such processes in detail for the 14 tev lhc . in this paper",
    "we update the study for early lhc at 7 tev , and focus on the significant reach and robustness of a signal with the number of events from 1 fb@xmath1    this scenario is a generic possibility from the point of view of many susy models @xcite .",
    "heavier squark masses are often preferred due to constraints from flavor changing neutral currents and cp violation . even more generally , when embedding low energy supersymmetry into a string theory , moduli stabilization and cosmological constraints imply that moduli masses and gravitno mass , and consequently scalar masses @xcite , must be larger than about 20 tev @xcite . then , standard renormalization group ( rg ) running of scalar masses from the unification scale down to the electroweak scale will push the third generation squark masses significantly lower than those of the other generations . in most cases",
    "this turns out to be right handed stop squark .",
    "alternative models leading to multi - top final states , and corresponding anaylsis approaches , have been studied @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more extensive list . ) .",
    "the gluino decays via virtual squarks to @xmath2 or @xmath3 . since the rate for a given diagram scales as the virtual squark mass to the @xmath4 power from the propagator , the lightest squarks dominate",
    "therefore , we are led to consider decay channels @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "decays of multiple top quarks lead to b - rich and lepton rich final states , and give excellent potential for early discovery .",
    "in fact , we show that significant excesses can be observed at the early lhc-7 tev .",
    "for example , gluino masses larger than 600 gev can be discovered in the single - lepton plus 4 b - jets channel .",
    "we carry out our study on several benchmark models . to study the reach of gluino pair production , with decays into third generation squarks , a detailed scan of the parameter space involving the gluino mass and lsp mass , for different branching ratios , is performed .",
    "we emphasize that the goal of this study is to demonstrate that gluino pair production with decays via third generation squarks provides an ideal channel for early discovery at the lhc , since it leads to lepton and @xmath8-quark rich final states .",
    "three benchmark models are considered which will form the basis for the numerical scan discussed below .",
    "the model parameters and relevant decay branching ratios are shown in table  [ tab : model ] .",
    "model a is a simple example of multi - top physics .",
    "the spectrum would have a stop much lighter than the other squarks , and therefore gluino pair production always produces four tops in the final state .",
    "model b is designed to include the decay channel @xmath9 , which will result if the sbottom is also lighter than the first two generation squarks , and @xmath10 .",
    "model b is observably different than model a , while somewhat more difficult to discover .",
    "these models have a bino - like lsp . in model c ,",
    "the wino is the lsp , and is approximately degenerate with the lightest chargino , which is also wino - like .",
    "it is designed to further include a chargino in the decay chain , which allows the decay @xmath11 .",
    "since the charged wino is approximately degenerate with the wino lsp , it appears only as missing energy ; though if one focuses on the signal events the chargino stub @xcite can probably be seen in the vertex detector .",
    ".[tab : model ] relevant branching ratios for the benchmark models considered in this paper .",
    "the models a and b have bino lsp . in model c ,",
    "the lightest neutralino and lightest chargino are both winos . in all models",
    "the first two generation squark masses are taken to be 8 tev .",
    "the third generation is taken to be somewhat lighter and is chosen to generate the required branching ratios of the model . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "for each model ( a fixed @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , we simulated @xmath14 of data using pythia and pgs .",
    "then we searched for the models over the backgrounds for the selection cuts in eqs .",
    "[ cut1]-[cut2 ] in each of the @xmath8-jet and lepton ( @xmath15 ) channels .",
    "a statistical significance in a @xmath16 channel is defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of signal(background ) events expected to be in the @xmath19-channel for one of the two selection cuts in eqs .",
    "[ cut1]-[cut2 ] .",
    "thus , if for any of the significances , @xmath20 , the model can be considered discoverable at @xmath14 . in figures [ fig : ttttmultiplechannels ] we plot @xmath21 contours , for the channels @xmath22 in the first two channels _ cut-1 _ is used , and in the last three channel , the weaker _ cut-2 _ , is used .",
    "as is evident from table [ tab : counts ] , the backgrounds for @xmath23 are significantly smaller than the backgrounds for @xmath24 , and therefore it is not beneficial to combine them into the inclusive channel @xmath25 .",
    "the channels we used in this study maximize the significance .    in all case",
    "the @xmath26- channel provides the best channel for discovery .",
    "but , the ss - dilepton channel can be a competitive mode for discovery .",
    "it is important that the 4-top final state will give signatures in several channels if it appears in any . finding a second predicted channel would be valuable confirmation .",
    "if two or more channels are present a combined significance would be a useful construct and facilitate a claim of discovery .",
    "we have studied the signatures of low energy supersymmetry in multi - top and/or multi-@xmath8 production at 7 tev lhc , and associated standard model backgrounds .",
    "results are presented in terms of discovery reaches for @xmath14 . in recent years a number of models have been proposed that lead to such final states .",
    "the required spectrum , heavy squarks with the third generation somewhat lighter than the first two and light gluino , satisfies the existing experimental constraints better and can be motivated on very general theoretical grounds .",
    "in addition , it has been realized that generic string theories compactified to 4 dimensions and satisfying phenomenological constraints typically lead to such final states ( as briefly described in the introduction ) .",
    "thus such final states have emerged as an unusually well - motivated discovery channel at lhc .",
    "we focus on gluino pair production in supersymmetric theories both because of the strong theoretical motivations and because of the well defined nature of the such models . at 7 tev lhc with @xmath14",
    "the reach can be over 600 gev ( up to about 650 gev ) gluino mass .",
    "discovery reach at higher luminosity can be scaled from our result straightforwardly .",
    "precise discovery reach at a different energy requires a different full study , such as the case of @xmath27 tev studied in ref .",
    "however , we can roughly estimate for @xmath28 tev , the reach in gluino mass can be enhanced by about a factor of @xmath29 .",
    "top reconstruction was studied in @xcite and is difficult , but counting leptons and @xmath8-jets excess for discovery is robust .",
    "the size of the counting signal provides information on the gluino cross section , which in turn is correlated with the gluino spin .",
    "addition kinematical distributions could also help to enhance the discovery reach .",
    "more careful analysis , preferably with data driven approaches , will be necessary to understand the background distribution in detail .",
    "we urge experimentalists to focus attention on these channels .",
