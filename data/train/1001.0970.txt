    "long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( lgrbs ) , with a duration of @xmath12 s , are typically associated with the core - collapse of rapidly - rotating massive stars ( woosley 1993 ) .",
    "these events are commonly accompanied by multi - wavelength afterglows and broad - lined type ic supernovae ( e.g. galama et al .",
    "1998 , stanek et al .",
    "2003 , woosley & bloom 2006 ) .",
    "several recent studies have presented evidence that lgrbs may occur preferentially in low - metallicity environments , a conclusion supported by both inferred ( e.g. fruchter et al .",
    "1999 , 2006 ; fynbo et al .  2003 ; le floch et al .",
    "2003 ) , and directly measured metallicities ( e.g. stanek et al .",

    "2009 ) .",
    "most recently , in levesque et al .",
    "( 2010a ) we published the first results from a spectroscopic survey of lgrb host galaxies , calculating metallicities and other ism properties for 10 lgrb hosts .",
    "a statistical comparison of this sample to the general star - forming galaxy population presents evidence that the ism properties of these 10 lgrb host galaxies are offset from the general population , and have low - metallicity environments out to @xmath2 .",
    "this low - metallicity trend agrees with predictions of stellar evolutionary theory ( assuming a single - star progenitor model ) , which postulate that the rapid rotation required to produce a grb demands low line - driven mass loss rates in the progenitor ( e.g. woosley & heger 2006 ) , following the mass loss - metallicity relation of @xmath3 ( vink et al .",
    "however , our understanding of grb host environments and progenitors is still evolving , and must strive to accommodate the increasing number of unusual bursts that are detected and observed , as well as potential selection effects introduced by host galaxy luminosities and optical afterglows ( e.g. wolf & podsiadlowski 2007 , fynbo et al .",

    "however , follow - up observations of the burst detected no optical afterglow to a limiting magnitude of @xmath6 and @xmath7 at only 9 hours after the burst ; this lack of an optical afterglow detection classifies grb 020819 as a  dark \" burst ( levan et al .",

    "( 2005 ) later confirmed that this galaxy , at a redshift of @xmath9 , was the likely host of grb 020819 , with a chance superposition probability of 0.8% .",
    "the radio afterglow is specifically located on a faint r @xmath10 24  blob `` of emission , @xmath53 '' from the bright barred spiral host and assumed to be at the same redshift ( jakobsson et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "klose et al .",
    "( 2003 ) speculate that the dark nature of grb 020819 could be due to large amounts of dust extinction in the host . under this hypothesis ,",
    "the optical afterglow could have been extincted past the limits of detection by a high host @xmath11 .",
    "jakobsson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) considered this possibility in the context of the host redshift . using fits to the radio light curve to predict maximum optical fluxes for a variety of afterglow models , they find that a modest amount of extinction - @xmath12 0.6 - 1.5 mag - is required to extinguish an optical afterglow with a classical luminosity",
    ". however , it is also possible that the optical afterglow of grb 020819 is undetected due to intrinsically low luminosity , a scenario proposed for other dark bursts ( e.g. , fryer et al .  1999 , de pasquale et al .",

    "we also adopt the [ nii]@xmath176584/h@xmath19 diagnostic relation presented in pettini & pagel ( 2004 ) , a diagnostic independent of extinction effects , and find a metallicity of log(o / h ) + 12 = 8.8 @xmath0 0.1 . as this calibration",

    "( 2008 ) and a sample of blue compact galaxies from kong & cheng ( 2002 ; for further discussion of these comparison samples see levesque et al .",
    "it is evident that both the metallicity and age of the grb 020819 host galaxy set it apart from the current sample of lgrb host galaxies .",
    "adopting the pettini & pagel ( 2004 ) [ nii]/h@xmath19 metallicity diagnostic , the explosion site metallicity of log(o / h ) + 12 = 8.7 @xmath0 0.1 is considerably higher than the mean lgrb host metallicity of log(o / h ) + 12 = 8.1 @xmath0 0.2 derived using the same diagnostic .",
    "similarly , the young stellar population age of 7.8 @xmath0 0.9 myr determined for the grb 020819 host galaxy nucleus is older than the mean age of 5.2 @xmath0 0.15 myr calculated for the young stellar populations of lgrb host galaxies .",
    "both of these disparities suggest that the progenitor of grb 020819 formed in a markedly different environment than that seen in other lgrb host galaxies .",

    "( 2006 ) , as well as the sample of metal - poor galaxies from brown et al .",
    "finally , we include the new grid of stellar population synthesis and photoionization models published in levesque et al .",
    "( 2010b ) , to provide an independent comparison of metallicity and ionization parameter .",
    "we can see that emission line diagnostic ratios determined for both the grb 020819 host galaxy nucleus and explosion site are distinct from the lgrb host galaxies of levesque et al .",
    "( 2010a ) . in figure 3 ( bottom )",
    "we do see one lgrb host galaxy that appears to have a similarly high metallicity ; however , this data point represents the host galaxy of grb 031203 , which has shown evidence of agn activity that may contaminate emission - line - based determinations of its ism properties ( levesque et al .",
    "2010a ) . the grb 020819 host galaxy shows no similar signs of such activity ; in both diagnostic diagrams the grb 020819 host appears to be very similar to a typical star - forming sdss galaxy , in marked contrast to the other lgrb host galaxies .",
    "our spectroscopic observations and metallicity diagnostics have demonstrated that grb 020819 did _ not _ occur in a low - metallicity region of the spiral host , but rather that the progenitor formed and evolved in a host environment with a super - solar metallicity .",
    "this is further supported by examining the position of the grb 020819 nucleus and explosion site on the emission line diagnostic diagrams of figure 3 .",
    "this high metallicity sets grb 020819 apart from all other lgrb host galaxies examined to date - while some hosts appear to have solar or near - solar metallicities based on afterglow spectra , the relationship between afterglow absorption metallicities and emission - line metallicities has not been examined and these values may not be directly comparable .",
    "it is also possible that higher - metallicity host galaxies might be missing from the current sample due to selection effects ; the size and nature of this bias is addressed in detail in graham et al .  in prep .    due to the young lifetimes ( @xmath31 10 myr , woosley et al .",
    "2002 ) associated with the assumed massive star progenitors of lgrbs , we can take the metallicities of their host environments to be representative of the progenitor star metallicities .",
    "the high - metallicity ism environment that produced grb 020819 is therefore particularly surprising in the context of our current understanding of progenitor scenarios and evolution for lgrbs .",
    "it has been suggested that low metallicities are required to produce the rapidly - rotating progenitors and relativistic explosions associated with lgrbs ( e.g. vink et al .",
    "2001 , meynet & maeder 2005 , woosley & heger 2006 ) and the general low metallicity trend seen in lgrb host galaxies supports this claim ( e.g. modjaz et al .",
    "2008 , kocevski et al .",
    "2009 , levesque et al .",
    "however , the exact nature of this correlation between metallicity and grb progenitors remains unclear .",
    "the recent type ic supernova sn 2009bb was found to have a central - engine - driven relativistic component similar to that associated with lgrbs , although no accompany gamma - ray trigger was associated with the event ( soderberg et al .",
    "the host environment of this supernova was found to have a very high metallicity ( levesque et al .",
    "2010c ) , contradicting the supposition that engine - driven relativistic supernovae could only be produced in low - metallicity environments .",
    "while its metallicity is not as high by comparison , the only other lgrb host galaxy with a @xmath32 metallicity is grb 051022 .",
    "graham et al .",
    "( 2009 ) point out that grb 051022 is , like grb 020819 , a  dark \" burst , and postulate that the higher metallicity seen in grb 051022 may be shared by the grb 020819 host environment , a speculation that has been confirmed by these results .",
    "the question of what role high metallicity might play in the production of  dark \" bursts is an intriguing one , and requires a detailed comparison of the host environments and energetic properties of these two bursts ( see graham et al .",
    ", in prep , for a comparison of grb 020819 and grb 051022 as well as new hst observations of the grb 051022 host galaxy ) .",
    "while both host galaxies include a moderate amount of extinction ( @xmath11 = 1.55 for grb 051022 , @xmath11 = 1.98 for grb 020819 ) , we can not rule out the possibility that direct effects of high metallicity environments on progenitor evolution might be responsible for the  dark \" nature of these bursts .",
    "for example , the enhanced mass loss rates associated with higher metallicities could potentially contribute to large amount of circumburst extinction , an artifact of larger amounts of mass lost during the progenitor s lifetime ( e.g. , vink et al .",
    "this is particularly intriguing if anisotropies in stellar winds and mass loss are considered for a single - star progenitor model .",
    "polar mass ejections remove much less angular momentum than equatorial ejections ( maeder 2002 )",
    ". a polar mass loss mechanism could both permit the production of grb progenitors at higher metallicities by allowing higher rotation rates to be maintained , _ and _ increase the circumburst extinction at the poles where the grb itself is produced , leading to increased extinction of the optical afterglow .",
    "however , the full implications that grb 020819 and its unusual host environment have for our understanding of  dark \" bursts and their progenitor evolution still remain to be explored .",
