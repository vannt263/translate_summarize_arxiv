    "to understand the assembly of stars in galaxies , it is crucial to characterize the star formation rate and the total stellar mass already formed as a function of the dynamical mass ( the mass of the halo including dark matter ) .",
    "determining this relation at intermediate and high redshifts allows us to explore whether we are seeing the initial build - up of stellar mass in a fully - formed dark halo , or if the stellar mass to total mass ratio is fairly constant compared to lower - redshift samples ( as might be the case if much of the stellar mass formed very early , or dark haloes were assembled through dry mergers triggering little further star formation ) .",
    "the redshifts range @xmath13 is therefore of great interest as massive galaxies are thought to undergo their most active period of star formation ( e.g , @xcite ) .    in the past , deep multi - wavelength surveys ( e.g. , goods  @xcite ; hubble deep field  @xcite ; deep2 ",

    "it is plausible that some may be perturbed by bursts of star formation and merging to lie outside the low - redshift morphological classification scheme ( the familiar hubble sequence ) . to properly explore whether this is the case , or instead if most star - forming galaxies have stable disk kinematics , requires studying the resolved kinematic structure through ",
    "3d \" spectroscopy with integral field units ( ifus ) .",
    "the recent advent of high resolution ifus on 8m - class telescopes has enabled the study of high - redshift galaxies on scales of a few kiloparsecs in seeing - limited conditions ( e.g.  @xcite ) and even down to sub - kiloparsec scales using adaptive optics and the magnification due to gravitational lensing ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "very recent studies using integral field spectroscopy have started to give an insight into the kinematics properties and physical phenomena at play in high redshift galaxies , such as merging and galactic winds associated with strong star formation .",

    "error maps for the velocity and dispersion measurements were also computed , which are dominated by the effect of random noise in fitting the line profile , which produces large errors at low s / n .",

    "the left - most panel , ( a ) , of figure [ map1 ] shows the uv rest - frame morphology around 1500 , with panel ( b ) showing the maps of the ionized gas morphology for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "for the four objects of the sample , the uv rest - frame morphology and the morphology of the ionized gas appear similar .",
    "vvds-3884 presents a bright concentrated central region , with a diameter of 2.3 kpc .",
    "two fainter regions slightly elongated toward the south and the northwest surround the bright nucleus .",
    "vvds-8666 exhibits an elliptical morphology with a large peak in intensity at its centre in both the @xmath124-band image and the line map .",
    "the galaxy vvds-7772 looks compact , showing a peak in the ionized gas map slightly offset to the north - east .",
    "vvds-5183 consists of a bright nucleus and a low surface brightness elongated region extended toward the north - east .    for vvds-8666 we used the galfit software @xcite on the cfht @xmath124-band image , to deduce the morphological parameters such as the center , the position angle , and the axial ratio .",
    "assuming that the rest - uv light is dominated by stars in an inclined disk , we derived a position angle of @xmath146 east of north and an inclination of @xmath147 ( where @xmath148 would be an edge - on disk ) . for the other galaxies in our sample , the images were too faint , compromised by a stellar diffraction spike , or lacked good nearby psf stars for galfit to return satisfactory fits .",
    "we assume that the rest - uv morphology of the young stellar population will closely trace that of the nebular emission from the ionized gas , and hence we infer the morphological parameters of the galaxies from the [ o  iii ] map .",
    "we fit a 2d gaussian with the fwhm along the major axis , with the axial ratio and position angle as free parameters .",
    "a first guess of the position angle is estimated from the velocity map as the direction where the gradient in the velocity profile is maximum .",
    "it is then allowed to vary between @xmath149 in the rotation modelling ( see [ model ] ) which finally gives the best - fit position angle .",
    "if the galaxy is a disk , then the inclination is estimated as @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the radius of the major - axis ( along the first guess of the position angle ) and @xmath152 the radius of the minor - axis ( at @xmath153 ) .",
    "we measured the area of the nebular emission ( deconvolved with the psf ) from the two - dimensional  flux map for each of the galaxies ( table [ nebular_sfr ] ) .",
    "each galaxy is modelled by a pure , infinitely thin , rotating disk .",
    "the parameters of a model are the kinematic centre ( @xmath154,@xmath155 ) , the position angle ( pa ) , the inclination ( @xmath156 ) , the velocity offset ( @xmath157 ) of the centre relative to the integrated spectrum , and the velocity curve @xmath158 where @xmath65 is the radius from the kinematic centre .",
    "we also use the true physical velocity dispersion @xmath159 as a model parameter , which we assume is constant , and represents the thickness of the rotating disk .",
    "the radial velocity @xmath160 for any point is then defined with standard projection equations .",
    "note that the position angle gives the direction of positive radial velocities .",
    "the velocity offset accounts for redshift uncertainties .",
    "we define the velocity curve by two parameters , following @xcite : the maximum velocity @xmath161 and the radius @xmath162 where this maximum velocity is achieved . in this model , below @xmath162 the velocity is defined as @xmath163 the model computes @xmath164 , the asymptotic maximum rotation velocity at the plateau of the rotation curve , corrected for inclination ( @xmath165 ) .    in reality",
    ", the spatial resolution is limited by the seeing and the spaxel size .",
    "the observed radial velocity is thus the weighted convolution of the true radial velocity by the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the weights come from the flux map of the line used to compute the velocity map : a spaxel where the observed line flux is negligible will not contribute to the convolution . additionally , the observed velocity dispersion accounts not only for the true physical dispersion , but also for the variations in the velocity field inside the width of the psf .",
    "we generate a map of the velocity dispersion where the velocity gradient ( determined from the modelling ) has been subtracted .",
    "this yields a better measure of the intrinsic local velocity dispersion , rather than a raw value of @xmath143 which may be inflated if the velocity gradient across a spaxel is large . from this map , we compute the flux - weighted mean velocity dispersion , @xmath166 ( table  [ kinematic_properties ] ) .",
    "we also measure a velocity width for the emission lines from the extracted 1d spectrum ( i.e. the total integrated light ) ; this @xmath167 includes contributes both from the random motions and any ordered rotation or bulk motions .",
    "the beam smearing introduced by the psf causes two significant effects .",
    "first , the observed velocity map appears smoothed , so the velocity gradient and the maximum velocity are underestimated .",
    "second , the observed dispersion map shows a peak of dispersion near to the kinematic centre .",
    "we can reproduce modelled velocity and dispersion maps by applying mathematically the same weighted convolution to the ideal velocity field .",
    "these modelled maps are compared to the observed maps by a @xmath168 minimization .",
    "the parameters which minimize the @xmath168 are computed in two successive grids with increasing resolution .",
    "first guesses for the kinematic centre , the position angle , and the inclination are set from the morphology .",
    "the vvds-8666 galaxy displays a well - resolved velocity gradient over @xmath169kpc in projected distance with a peak - to - peak amplitude of 92kms@xmath7 ( uncorrected for inclination ) .",
    "there is some evidence of a flattening of the rotation curve , particularly in the eastern - most region of the galaxy . taking into account the fact that these data are seeing limited ,",
    "the smearing effect of the seeing decreases the peak - to - peak observed amplitude while mostly keeping the overall shape of the velocity shear .",
    "this shear appears to be aligned with the morphological major axis defined by the ionized gas , and is also nearly spatially coincident with the peak in the dispersion map .",
    "this , combined with the fact that the nebular line flux distribution is centrally concentrated , leads us to conclude that the observed shear is consistent with a rotating gaseous disk rather than a merger .",
    "figure [ comp2d_666 ] shows the  velocity map recovered from the rotation modelling ( see figure [ map1 ] , panel c ) and convolved with the psf .",
    "it show also the one - dimensional relative velocity curves along the kinematic major axis for both the sinfoni observed velocity shear and the best - fit model .",
    "the velocity is well matched by our simple rotating disk model , leading to an inclination - corrected @xmath170 kms@xmath7 .",
    "however , the ratio of the rotation velocity to the velocity dispersion is large ( @xmath171 ) compared with lower - redshift samples of galactic disks ( @xmath172 , @xcite ) which probably indicates that this object is not mainly supported by rotation , and there are significant random motions .",
    "the presence of random motion is in particular confirmed by a peak of @xmath173 km / s , located to the north of the galaxy , in the residuals of the velocity maps after subtraction of the rotating model .",
    "the velocity map of vvds-7772 ( the companion galaxy of vvds-8666 ) shows a smoothly varying gradient along the north - south axis , but without evidence for a flattening .",
    "however , this galaxy is very compact and only marginally resolved .",
    "we note that the velocity fields of both vvds-7772 and vvds-8666 are aligned along their displacement vector and close to the major axis of the resolved galaxy vvds-8666 , so this combined system might plausibly be part of a single rotating disk .",
    "the best fit simple rotation model give an asymptotic velocity of @xmath174 km / s which is reached in @xmath175kpc radius .",
    "the @xmath143-map of the ionized gas of vvds-7772 shows strong variation with position , as can be seen in panel ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ map1 ] , which prevents us from modelling the true physical dispersion ; the weak constraint is @xmath176kms@xmath7 .",
    "in particular , @xmath143 peaks around 58kms@xmath7 in the south - western edge of the galaxy , slightly offset with respect to the flux peak for which @xmath143 decreases to around 50kms@xmath7 , and drops further to @xmath530 km s@xmath7 in the faint emission of the north - eastern region . however it is uncertain whether the peak of @xmath17758kms@xmath7 represents a real feature or is simply noise in the extreme edges of the galaxy . due to the compact size of this objects ( @xmath178kpc ) , it is difficult to draw conclusions on the nature of the kinematics from our seeing - limited observations .",
    "this galaxy presents an irregular velocity field , which is inconsistent with a smoothly varying velocity gradient along the major axis .",
    "it was therefore impossible to fit this disturbed shear with a single rotation model .",
    "the @xmath143-map shows a peak in the local velocity dispersion displaced from the centre of the galaxy , again inconsistent with disk rotation .",
    "this galaxy has the largest velocity dispersion in our sample ( @xmath179126kms@xmath7 ) .",
    "this galaxy is dominated by an extended emission line component at the systemic redshift with a faint secondary extension located @xmath5 2 kpc to the north - east .",
    "the two spatially distinct components are more apparent in the data cube ( i. e. the velocity map ) than in the intensity maps . between the two components , the velocity seems to return to the systemic ( central ) velocity of the main component , i.e.  the velocity of the whole system is not monotonically increasing with position .",
    "the faint secondary feature may represent a kinematically distinct star - forming region or a small galaxy in the process of merging with the brighter system .",
    "the primary component exhibits a smoothly varying velocity field well fit by a rotating disk aligned with the morphological major axis .",
    "however the maximum of the velocity shear is small ( @xmath180kms@xmath7 ) , and once again this galaxy has significant random motion ( high velocity dispersion ) with @xmath181 .",

    "firstly , we assume that the nebular emission from the gas traces keplerian motions ( i.e. the gas is not outflowing / inflowing , and is in orbit rather than unvirialized as might be the case during a merger ) .",
    "secondly , we can not say with certainty that any of our galaxies are traditional rotationally - supported gaseous disks  the ground - based seeing precludes accurate measurement of morphological parameters ( such as the crucial inclination angle ) .",
    "thirdly , the measured velocity dispersion is significant when compared with any velocity gradient across these galaxies , implying that a putative disk may not be supported purely by rotation .",
    "we have measurements of the spatially varying velocity field ( @xmath186 ) and velocity dispersion ( @xmath143 ) from our 3d data cubes , and in the 1d extracted spectrum we have a flux - weighted measure of the overall velocity spread in the galaxy ( @xmath167 ) which arises from the combined effects of any systematic velocity shift across the galaxy and random motions .",
    "we can use this @xmath167 as a crude estimate of the dynamical mass using the formula : @xmath187 the factor @xmath188 depends on the geometry of the system ( in particularly the density profile ) : for a uniform sphere , @xmath189 , and erb et al .",

    "of course , the availability of 3d data cubes means we can model any spatially - resolved systemic velocity shift , as might arise in a rotating disk ( see section  [ model ] ) . for objects where the velocity shear is well fitted by the simple rotation model , we compute the dynamical masses using the formula : @xmath192 where @xmath164 ( the turnover of the rotation curve ) has been inclination - corrected ( a factor of @xmath193 , fitted by the model from an initial estimate based on the observed ellipticity ) .",
    "both this asymptotic velocity , and the radius of the turnover ( @xmath194 ) are inferred from our model fits to the observed velocity maps to correct for the the effect of beam - smearing ( due to the seeing ) . only in one case ( vvds-8666 ) do we convincingly see this flattening of the rotation curve within the radius probed by our detected  emission ( fig .",
    "[ comp2d_666 ] ) , from which we infer @xmath195 . for galaxies vvds-7772 and",

    "[ comp2d_772 ] and fig .",
    "[ comp2d_183 ] respectively ) ; we can place a lower limit on the dynamical mass from the measured maximum velocity and spatial extent of the nebular emission : @xmath196 , which corresponds to @xmath197 in both these cases .",
    "the galaxy vvds-3884 does not demonstrate evidence of significant ordered rotation , and we were unable to fit a simple rotating disk model in this case .",
    "we present the results of a study of the kinematic properties of the ionized gas in four star - forming galaxies at redshift @xmath198 , from the spatially - resolved spectra of the [ o  iii ] & h@xmath29 nebular emission lines .",
    "we found that the ionized gas in these objects has high velocity dispersions ( @xmath199kms@xmath7 ) .",
    "we have also found that all our galaxies ( except vvds-7772 ) contain large quantities of gas as compared to their stellar mass and their dynamical mass inferred from rotation . with their high sfrs ,",
    "it is likely that these objects are undergoing episodes of strong star formation . due to our seeing - limited observations ,",
    "it is difficult to classify these objects with confidence as either ` disks ' or mergers . in the case vvds-8666 and its companion ( vvds-7772 ) , we classify them as a  heated disk system \" since for both galaxies the velocity structure of the ionized gas appears to be consistent with rotation .",
    "in fact it is unlikely that these objects have a dynamically cold rotating disk of ionized gas , due to the significant velocity dispersions .",
    "vvds-8666 has the highest metallicity , probably indicating a later evolutionary stage .",
    "the galaxy vvds-3884 possesses a particularly high nebular star formation rate as compared to its sed star formation rate which is consistent with this object experiencing a major recent burst of formation .",
    "this burst might originate from a major merging event , consistent with its complex kinematics . finally , vvds-5183 is mostly consistent with a merger on to a rotating disk .",
    "it has a huge star formation rate , a large fraction of gas and a low metallicity .    due to the uncertainties on the inclination angle for the objects in our sample ,",
    "it is not possible to investigate the traditional tully - fisher relation using .",
    "however , we can give an insight into a key question : can we use the line widths of integrated nebular emission to get a good estimation of the dynamical masses of galaxies showing low values of @xmath200 ?",
    "figure [ weiner2006_fig19 ] plots the combined velocity scale  against the one - dimensional line width  for the three galaxies for which we found a consistency with the presence of rotation .",
    "the combined velocity scale @xmath201 is estimated from the asymptotic velocity ( @xmath164 ) and the flux - weighted mean velocity dispersion , both inferred from the rotation modelling ( see figure [ weiner2006_fig19 ] ) .",
    "it represents an estimator , corrected from the smearing effect of the seeing ( see section [ model ] ) , of rotation velocity together with the presence of random motions .",
    "is also well known to be strongly correlated with  @xcite .",
    "we found a very good correlation between  and  for the vvds-8666 , vvds-7772 and the primary component of vvds-5183 .",
    "this shows not only that the one - dimensional line width  can be used as a kinematic measure when estimating dynamical masses , but that  alone can not suffice to trace the majority of the dynamical mass .",
    "in fact , using only  to investigate tully - fisher relation will push galaxies with @xmath202 to erroneously low dynamical masses ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "despite the small size of our sample , we can try to compare our results with those found by the ` sins ' survey @xcite , also using sinfoni on vlt , and the @xcite study using osiris on keck .",
    "our four galaxies have a mean assembled stellar mass of @xmath203 , while the ` sins ' galaxy population has a larger mass of @xmath204 .",
    "more comparable to our sample are the 13 galaxies detected by @xcite , selected by the bx technique , with stellar masses of @xmath205 .",
    "we also found , in agreement with @xcite , that such galaxies of intermediate mass at @xmath198 possess extremely large quantities of gas in comparison to their stellar mass .",
    "the typical @xmath200 for our sample is around @xmath206 .",
    "the @xcite sample have @xmath207 while the ` sins ' galaxies have a range of @xmath208 .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we have found evidence of agns in our sample .",
    "the connection between agn and star formation could play an important role in shaping galaxies at @xmath209 .",
    "figure [ law2009_fig9 ] plots the maximum observed shear velocity of galaxies , @xmath210 , as a function of stellar mass . our @xmath211 objects appear to have values of @xmath210 similar to the highest values detected by @xcite but corresponding to the lowest values displayed by the galaxies of the ` sins ' survey .",
    "in fact at similar stellar masses our galaxies tend to have higher values of @xmath210 than @xcite sample but similar values of @xmath210 to the @xcite sample .",
    "we also found in general that the highest mass galaxies do not tend to have the highest velocity shear among our objects , similar to the @xcite sample .",
    "therefore , our sample at @xmath212 seems to comprise intermediate mass and intermediate shear velocity objects , in contrast to the sub - sample of @xcite which seems to have negligible velocity shear and the more massive objects , and the ` sins ' survey sample which have appreciable old populations where stable rotation dominates .",
    "the similarity in properties of our sample of galaxies at @xmath213 with that of @xcite at @xmath214 , seems to confirm that these high - redshift objects have not yet turned a significant fraction of their gas into a sizeable stellar population .",
    "such galaxies also tend to possess high local velocity dispersions due to random motions intrinsic to the gas .",
    "if any velocity shear is present , it is not likely to be significant compared with the random motions , and probably occurs in a non - stable disk system .",
    "these galaxies also exhibit strong episodes of star formation and already possess metal rich gas .",
    "drawing general conclusions about the nature and the properties of the dynamical structure of distant galaxies based on the current set of observations is obviously very challenging , given the small size of current samples and the spatial resolution limitations .",
    "however , initial insights into the kinematic properties of @xmath215 galaxies on scales of a few kiloparsecs have been revealed by the recent ifu studies , although larger statistical samples and unbiased selection criteria are needed to give a quantitative picture of the mechanisms at play in such objects .",
    "it already appears that the dynamical state of galaxies during this early period , where the star formation appears to be intense , can not be easily classified based on what is observed at low redshift .",
    "specifically , the star - forming galaxies at @xmath216 ( even those with measurable velocity gradients ) exhibit large velocity dispersions quite unlike the cold rotationally - supported disks seen at lower redshift .",
