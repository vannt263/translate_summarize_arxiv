    "this work is dedicated to the memory of my beloved teacher and friend gerry brown who taught me how to think and approach a problem .",
    "i consider myself very lucky to * have been under the wings of this man who flew with the eagles * @xcite .",
    "by the year 1985 gerry brown and his collaborator hans bethe were able to compile three decades of work into a self containing comprehensive picture of core collapse ( type ii ) supernova explosions that could be even conveyed to a general audience in the popular publication of the scientific american @xcite .",
    "the onion layer structure of a 25 solar mass progenitor star just before it collapses under its own gravity and the temperature , density and duration of each prior burning stage are shown in fig .",
    "1 which is taken from this scientific american article @xcite .",
    "one of the central issue in the stellar evolution illustrated in fig .",
    "1 is whether type ii supernova end up as a black hole or a neutron star . in particular one would like to determine the smallest mass above which type ii supernova ends up as a black hole .",
    "early on gerry brown considered the effect of kaon condensate on the maximum possible mass for a neutron star that he derived to be no more than 1.5m@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "kaon condensate he claimed leads to a soft equation of state @xcite of the dense nuclear matter and it gave further credence to his limit on the maximum mass of a neutron star .",
    "this lead bethe and brown @xcite to conclude that low mass black hole with mass just above 1.5m@xmath0 may be very common and progenitors stars with mass as low as 17 - 18m@xmath0 , including supernova 1987a , ended up as a black hole .",
    "indeed the minimum mass of a progenitor star that collapses to a black hole seems to be around 20m@xmath0 , close to the mass of the progenitor star of the supernova 1987a and as we discuss below other nuclear structure effect play a role in concluding the minimum mass of the progenitor star .",
    "we consider here another nuclear structure effect that determines the fate of a type ii supernova vis - a - vis the c / o ratio at the end of helium burning .",
    "stellar helium burning , the second burning stage that follows hydrogen burning , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , is an important stage in the evolution of stars . during this stage the elements carbon and oxygen",
    "are formed and as such it is one of the most vivid examples of the anthropic principle @xcite . during this stage carbon",
    "is synthesized by the  triple-@xmath2 process \" via the hoyle state at 7.654 mev in @xmath3c but at the same time carbon is also destroyed by fusing with an additional alpha - particle to form @xmath4o in the @xmath3c@xmath5o reaction . hence the formation of oxygen in stellar helium burning determines the c / o ratio ; an essential parameter in stellar evolution theory @xcite .    stellar evolution theory requires the knowledge of the c / o ratio with an uncertainty of 5% .",
    "this requires accurate measurements at low energies and extrapolation of the measured astrophysical cross section factors to the gamow window at 300 kev @xcite .",
    "since mainly two ( @xmath6 = 1 and @xmath6 = 2 ) partial waves contribute to the reaction , accurate angular distribution data are needed at low energies to determine with high accuracy the astrophysical cross section factors @xmath7 and @xmath8 defined in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the importance of the c / o ratio for the evolution of massive stars ( @xmath9 ) that evolve to core collapse ( type ii ) supernova has been discussed extensively @xcite .",
    "more recently it was shown that the c / o ratio is also important for understanding the @xmath10ni mass fraction produced by lower mass stars ( @xmath11 ) that evolve into type ia supernova ( sneia ) @xcite .",
    "thus the c / o ratio is also important for understanding the light curve of sneia .",
    "such light curves of sneia are used as cosmological  standard candles \" with which the accelerated expansion of the universe and dark energy were recently discovered @xcite .",
    "recently some of the most impressive gamma - ray measurements of the @xmath3c@xmath5o reaction were published @xcite including measurements of complete angular distribution at center - of - mass energies approaching 1.0 mev .",
    "these measurements employ large luminosities of the order of @xmath12 @xmath13sec@xmath14 with integrated luminosities close to one inverse fb @xcite , and a large ( fraction of @xmath15 ) array of gamma - ray detectors ( but some of the arrays employ low - efficiency hpge detectors , which led in some cases to insufficient counting statistics ) .",
    "such unprecedented data with unprecedented characteristics led to an expectation of a resolution of the debate on the value of the low - energy cross section of the @xmath3c@xmath5o reaction . while these data did not resolve the outstanding questions they provide the first possible detailed study of the cross section of the @xmath3c@xmath5o reaction at low energies approaching 1.0 mev .",
    "values @xcite and the corresponding r - matrix fits .",
    "the two distinct groups of data extrapolate to @xmath16 and @xmath17 kevb .",
    "the @xmath18 values measured using the gandi @xcite and eurogam @xcite arrays are excluded , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=480 ]    in fig .",
    "2 we show the published  world data \" @xcite of @xmath18 values deduced from angular distributions measured at low energies ( @xmath19 mev ) as compiled in ref .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review of current data and other data analyses including the most recent analysis of schuermann _ et al .",
    "the current paper relies on the analysis presented in ref .",
    "@xcite where it is demonstrated that using @xmath20 analysis the data shown in fig .",
    "2 aggregate into two distinct groups .",
    "we also refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed @xmath21 analyses that lead us to remove the eurogam / gandi array results @xcite from the  world data \" and establish the grouping of the data shown in fig .",
    "2 .     values that will be measured by the current hi@xmath22s facility ( e@xmath23 mev ) @xcite and at the proposed hi@xmath22s2 and eli - np facilities.,width=480 ]    we conclude that current  world data \" on @xmath18 extracted from angular distributions measured at energies below 1.7 mev cluster in two distinct groups , leading to two different extrapolations of @xmath24 or @xmath25 kevb .",
    "neither one of these solutions can be favored or ruled out by the current  world data \" of measured angular distributions . in order to resolve this ambiguity in the value of @xmath8 one",
    "needs to measure complete and very detailed angular distributions for the @xmath3c@xmath5c reaction with high accuracy ( with binning of 10@xmath26 or less ) at very low energies ( below 1.8 mev ) .",
    "the data at large backward angles are most sensitive to the @xmath27 ratio , but such measurements with gamma - ray detectors are challenged by the finite size of the gamma - ray detector and the presence of the beam pipe .",
    "an experiment is currently in progress at the hi@xmath22s gamma - ray beam facility to measure the time reverse @xmath4o@xmath28c reaction using a time projection chamber ( tpc ) detector operating with @xmath29 gas @xcite and gamma - ray beam @xcite .",
    "such a measurement with gamma - ray beam and a tpc detector does not suffer from the limitation imposed when using a gamma - ray detector and angular distributions can be measured with any bin size for all angles between 0@xmath26 and 180@xmath26 as demonstrated in our recent measurement of the @xmath30 reaction @xcite with an optical readout tpc ( o - tpc ) at the hi@xmath22s facility .",
    "the ambiguity in the value of the extrapolated @xmath8 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite resembles the more familiar ambiguity in the value of the extrapolated @xmath7 value where even the data on the @xmath31-decay of @xmath4n shown in fig .",
    "18 ( and fig .",
    "16 ) of @xcite reveal two minima with identical @xmath32 values at @xmath33 10 kevb and @xmath34 80 kevb .",
    "the small value of the extrapolated @xmath35 kevb has been discussed by many authors @xcite and can not be resolved by the modern data as shown in fig .",
    "5 of @xcite . in order to resolve this ambiguity in the value of @xmath7 the newly proposed experiments @xcite must measure complete gamma - ray angular distributions of the @xmath3c@xmath5o reaction with high accuracy at low energies ( around 1.0 mev ) .",
    "a new measurement of the time reversed @xmath36c reaction is in progress using gamma - ray beams from the hi@xmath22s facility @xcite and new measurements are anticipated for the proposed new facilities hi@xmath22s2 at duke and eli - np in bucharest , romania .",
    "the anticipated sensitivity of this measurement is shown in fig .",
    "3 using simulated data .",
    "we conclude that the measured @xmath18 values of the @xmath1o reaction bifurcate into two groups extrapolating to @xmath37 60 kevb or @xmath34154 kevb .",
    "this newly observed ambiguity in the extrapolated @xmath8 value resembles the familiar ambiguity in the extrapolated @xmath7 value where the small @xmath33 10 kevb solution can not be ruled out in favor of the large @xmath34 80 kevb solution .",
    "these ambiguities in the extrapolated @xmath8 and @xmath7 values must be considered by practitioners in the field of stellar evolution theory and they must be resolved by the experiments now in progress @xcite .",
