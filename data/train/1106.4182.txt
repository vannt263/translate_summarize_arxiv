    "human beings look for a better job , partners , shelter , files in databases . even an attempt to unlock a pin - protected device can be considered as a search in the space of all possible passwords @xcite .",
    "search for a desired target depends generally on a variety of different conditions and may take place in different environments : targets may be sparse , hidden , difficult to detect even when found .",
    "the targets may be immobile or mobile , try to avoid searchers or to evade from the searched area @xcite .",
    "they may have no or may have their own life - time and vanish before they are detected .",
    "searchers may be immobile , as it happens , _",
    "e.g. _ , in visual search @xcite , may move freely or interact with the environment .",
    "their motion may be hindered under conditions of molecular crowding @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ , in cell s cytoplasm or in dynamical backgrounds formed by other randomly moving particles , or facilitated due to interactions with the molecular motors .",
    "the searchers may search `` blindly '' detecting the target only upon an encounter with it , or `` smell '' ( or `` see '' ) the target somehow at long distances correcting their motion @xcite .",
    "they may have no memory of previously visited area or adapt their strategy `` on - line '' repelling themselves from their footprints on the searched substrate .",
    "finally , the searchers may act individually or in swarms @xcite .    in general",
    ", for each specific situation different search strategies may be realized , and the question of efficient ones has motivated a great deal of work within the last years .",
    "while earlier works have considered deterministic search algorithms ( see , e.g. , refs.@xcite and references therein ) specific to such human activities as , say , search for natural resources or rescue operations , more recent studies focused on random search strategies . it was realized that the strategies based on lvy flights or walks @xcite , in which a searcher performs excursions whose lengths are random variables with heavy - tailed distributions , in some aspects are more advantageous than a search based on a conventional brownian motion , or on random walks which step on nearest - neighbors only .",
    "naturally , in this case the large - scale dynamics of searchers is superdiffusive .    following the observation of trajectories of foraging animals in which active local search phases randomly alternate with relocation phases ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) another type of random search - an intermittent search - has been proposed . in this algorithm",
    "the search process is characterized by two distinct types of motion - ballistic relocation stage when the searcher is non - receptive to the target and a relatively slow phase with a random brownian - type motion when the target may be detected @xcite .",
    "much effort has been invested recently in understanding different optimization schemes for such a random search . in particular",
    ", one looked for the conditions allowing to minimize the mean first passage time for the process which is unlimited in time @xcite , or seeked to enhance the chances of successful detection by minimizing the non - detection probability for the search process constrained to happen within a finite time interval @xcite .",
    "note that for such a search the large - scale dynamics is diffusive , albeit intermittent .",
    "finally , a combination of a lvy - based and intermittent search has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the length of the relocation stage was taken as a random variable with a heavy - tailed distribution .",
    "it was shown that such a combined strategy is advantageous in the critical case of rare targets .    in this paper",
    "we discuss some aspects of a blind search by a swarm of @xmath0 independent , _ non - communicating _ searchers .",

    "in which @xmath0 searchers ( numbered by the index @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) occupy initially the same position in space , at some distance @xmath10 apart of an immobile target , start their random motion simultaneously and arrive for the first time to the location of the target at times @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath4s are not ordered .",
    "clearly , in such a situation the first passage times @xmath4 s are independent , identically distributed random variables with the same distribution @xmath5 .",

    ", one can say that @xmath6 probes the validity of the _ mean _ first passage time as the proper measure of a search process efficiency .",
    "we proceed to show that in many situations @xmath6 has a rather complicated structure of which the mean behavior is not representative . we will show that in different situations @xmath6 may have completely different shapes ( modality ) and also change the shape ( say , from a unimodal bell - shaped form to a bimodal @xmath21- or an @xmath22-shaped one ) when some of the parameters are slightly modified .",

    "in fact , the case @xmath33 appears to be very representative . according to the theorem due to sparre andersen @xcite , in 1d systems for any discrete - time random walk with each step length chosen from a continuous , symmetric but otherwise arbitrary distribution the first passage time distribution @xmath36 decays with a number of steps @xmath37 as @xmath38 . for continuous - time @xmath27 markov processes ,",
    "an analogous result is @xmath39 .",
    "this universality , of course , is broken when subordination effects ( i.e. , long tailed waiting time distributions in a ctrw sense ) are present .",
    "although not exact , the distribution in eq .  ( [ distribution ] ) is physically quite plausible for other types of random motion in infinite 1d systems provided that an appropriate choice of the exponent @xmath29 is made @xcite : in particular , eq .  ( [ distribution ] ) with @xmath40 is a reasonable approximation for the first - arrival probability density for lvy flights with lvy index @xmath41 , @xmath42 @xcite and with @xmath43 @xcite - for the first - passage - time distribution for fractional bm with hurst index @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",

    "hence , its long - time tail is the same as the long - time tail of the time derivative of the smoluchowski constant @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath50 can be encountered in border - line situations of compact exploration , when the dimension of space @xmath48 equals the fractal dimension @xmath49 of the random motion trajectories . in particular , this situation is realized for standard bm ( @xmath51 ) in two - dimensional ( 2d ) space .",

    "finally , one finds @xmath53 , ( or , more generally , @xmath54 ) , for brownian ( anomalous ) motion in @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) dimensional systems .",
    "note , however , that here the expression in eq .",
    "( [ distribution ] ) is not normalized and thus can not be considered as a distribution since only a finite fraction of trajectories will visit the target within an infinite time so that the searchers will have a finite probability to escape to infinity ( non compact exploration @xcite ) .",

    "i.e. _ , the _ mean _ first passage time can be regarded as a robust measure of the search process efficiency .",
    "we set out to show that in many situations this is not the case due to the significant sample - to - sample fluctuations .    the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ truncated_dist ] ) is exact for a bm in semi - infinite 1d systems in presence of a constant bias pointing towards the target ( see , _",

    "has @xmath34 , where @xmath10 is the starting point and @xmath59 , @xmath60 being the drift velocity .",
    "one may argue , as well , that the expression in eq .",
    "( [ truncated_dist ] ) is an appropriate approximation for the first - passage time distribution for search in finite systems or search assisted by smell . in general , of course , for random motion in finite systems the distribution @xmath5 will be represented as a series of exponentials ; the form in eq .",
    "( [ truncated_dist ] ) is thus tantamount to a heuristic approximation of this series in which one takes a behavior specific to an infinite system and truncates it by an exponential function with the characteristic decay time equal to the largest relaxation time .",
    "depending on a particular situation , the cut - off parameter @xmath61 will be either proportional to the volume of the system ( for bm in @xmath55 systems ) , to @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the length of the interval for bm in 1d , to @xmath64 for bm in finite 2d systems of area @xmath65 , or inversely proportional to the strength of the bias for biased diffusion .",
    "some of these situations will be discussed in detail in the sequel .",
    "we finally remark that the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ truncated_dist ] ) appears in many other physical problems . to name but a few we mention the distribution of times between action potentials ( or the isi distribution ) in the integrate - and - fire model of neuron dynamics @xcite , the distribution of the stopping distances for the sliding motion of a solid block on an inclined heterogeneous plane @xcite , the avalanche life - time distribution in the mean - field version of the bak - sneppen model @xcite , the distribution of the probability current in finite disordered one - dimensional samples @xcite or the distribution of the number of times that a particle diffusing in a sphere hits its boundary during some time interval @xcite",
    "thus our subsequent analysis applies to these systems as well .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows : we start in section 1 with a general remark on the tails of the first passage time distribution in case with @xmath0 independent randomly moving searchers . in section 2",
    "we derive an exact result for the distribution @xmath6 for @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ distribution ] ) with arbitrary @xmath29 and for arbitrary @xmath0 . in section 3",
    "we discuss several exactly solvable particular cases .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the asymptotic analysis of @xmath6 for large @xmath0 and arbitrary @xmath29 . in section 5",
    "we evaluate @xmath6 for the exponentially - truncated distribution in eq .",
    "( [ truncated_dist ] ) in case of two searchers .",
    "we also furnish here exact calculations of @xmath6 for two bms in finite 1d , 2d and 3d spherical domains .",
    "next , in section 6 , we discuss the form of @xmath6 for @xmath0 searchers whose first passage time distribution is given by eq .",
    "( [ truncated_dist ] ) .",
    "finally , in section 7 we conclude with a summary of our results and some generalizations .",
    "we begin with a somewhat evident but conceptually very important remark on the tails of the first passage time distribution in case of @xmath0 independent , non - communicating randomly moving searchers . for the original results and a discussion we address the reader to ref .",
    "some other interesting aspects of this model were discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let @xmath66 denote the probability that up to time moment @xmath27 neither of @xmath0 searchers has visited the target , _",
    "i.e. _ , the target remained non - detected up to time @xmath27 .",
    "for the situation under consideration , clearly , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is an analogous probability for a single searcher .",
    "supposing that the target is found as soon as any of the searchers arrives to its location for the first time , we have that for @xmath0 searchers the first passage density @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 this yields immediately that @xmath69 follows ( for the parental distribution in eq .",
    "( [ distribution ] ) ) , as @xmath71 , @xmath72 a remarkable feature of this simple result is that depending on the number of searchers @xmath0 , the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ dist1 ] ) may have finite moments even if @xmath73 , contrary to the parent distribution in eq .",
    "( [ distribution ] ) which does not have any moment for such values of @xmath29 . for instance , for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , eq .",
    "( [ dist1 ] ) has a finite first moment , _ i.e. _ , a finite mean first passage time , for @xmath76 it has a finite second moment , and generally , for @xmath77 it has @xmath1 first finite moments .",
    "this is a crucially important advantage of search processes involving @xmath0 searchers , which makes the search process more efficient even for non - communicating searchers .",
    "next , it might be instructive to consider some exactly solvable case , _",
    "i.e. _ , bm in semi - infinite 1d systems , and to calculate the @xmath0-dependence of the mean first passage time . in this case",
    ", the probability that a single searcher has not visited the location of the target ( the origin ) up to time moment @xmath27 , starting at distance @xmath10 from the target , obeys @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the error function .",
    "hence , the first moment of the distribution in eq .",
    "( [ qq ] ) , _ i.e. _ , the mean first passage time @xmath80 for an ensemble of @xmath0 independent searchers is defined as @xmath81 the integral in the latter equation is convergent , as we have already remarked , for @xmath82 . one verifies that @xmath83 is a slowly _ decreasing _ function of the number of searchers @xmath0 , and , for @xmath84 , we find that @xmath85 therefore , the more searchers one has , the less the mean first passage time is . curiously enough , this essentially 1d result , @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) , coincides exactly with the mean residence time which @xmath0 bms spend simultaneously together in a circular disc of radius @xmath10 on a 2d plane within an infinite time interval @xcite , or with the mean first exit time of one of @xmath0 bms from such a disc @xcite .",
    "note finally that the mean first passage time may acquire a much stronger dependence on @xmath0 and decrease much faster for communicating searchers which share the information on the location of the target @xcite .",
    "note , as well , that increasing the number of `` searchers '' allows to decrease substantially the time necessary to reach the target site on a dna for proteins which strongly bind to other nonspecific sites acting as deep temporal traps @xcite .",
    "some properties of the first passage time distribution for the event in which @xmath0 random walks appear for the first time simultaneously at the same lattice site have been discussed in ref .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) into eq .",

    "( [ m ] ) defines an exact distribution @xmath6 for arbitrary @xmath29 and @xmath0 . in several particular cases ,",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) can be performed in closed form : when @xmath102 or @xmath103 and arbitrary @xmath104 , or when @xmath29 is equal to a half of an odd integer , while @xmath0 is arbitrary .",
    "we discuss below some of these cases , as well as present an asymptotic analysis of @xmath6 in the limit @xmath84 .",
    "consider first the case of just two random searchers , @xmath105 . for this simple situation , one readily finds from eq .",

    "this result has been also obtained within a different context in ref .",

    "notice now that , despite its simplicity , the result in eq .",

    "strikingly , the mean @xmath109 corresponds in this case to the _ least probable _ value of the distribution .",
    "this signifies that in this case there is no symmetry between two identical searchers and both arrive to the target for the first time at distinctly different times .",
    "note that for @xmath33 ( two bms in 1d ) , @xmath110 and hence , the probability @xmath111 that @xmath14 attains any value from the interval @xmath112 $ ] obeys @xmath113 which is the continuous arcsine distribution .    when @xmath31 , the distribution @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ lim ] ) is uniform , which means that for either of the searchers its first passage time , relative to the average over the ensemble of two searchers , may take any value with equal probability .",
    "finally , for @xmath32 the distribution @xmath6 is unimodal and centered at @xmath114 .",

    "since @xmath14 equals , by definition , the realization - dependent first passage time of a given searcher relative to the realization - dependent ensemble - average first passage time of @xmath0 searchers , the distribution @xmath6 can be viewed as a measure of the robustness of a given search algorithm and of the underlying random motion ( space exploration ) , which also probes the validity of the _ mean _ first passage time of a single searcher as a proper and/or informative measure of the search efficiency .",
    "we have considered two general forms of @xmath5 : the one in eq .",
    "( [ distribution ] ) , which is appropriate for search in unbounded domains and is characterized by a power - law long - time tail @xmath335 , where the exponent @xmath336 encodes the specific details of the searchers random motion , and an exponentially tempered form in eq .",
    "( [ truncated_dist ] ) , which is a plausible approximation for random motion in finite domains or search assisted by a constant bias ( `` smell '' ) towards the target .",
    "we have shown that for a non - truncated distribution @xmath5 in eq .",

    "for @xmath105 the distribution is symmetric around @xmath114 with @xmath114 being the minimum of the distribution .",
    "this signifies that the `` symmetry '' between two identical searchers is broken .",
    "for @xmath337 the distribution @xmath6 is skewed ( by a factor @xmath200 ) towards the small values of @xmath14 and can be expressed , in an explicit form , as a one - sided @xmath41-stable distribution with @xmath191 . for @xmath128 ,",
    "the distribution @xmath6 has a bell - shaped form but the most probable value of @xmath14 is always less than the mean value @xmath338 .",
    "the most probable and the mean values of @xmath14 coincide only when @xmath140 .",
    "for the exponentially truncated @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ truncated_dist ] ) the distribution @xmath6 always has a bell - shaped form for @xmath128 . for @xmath125",
    ", however , the situation is more complicated and interesting .",
    "we realized first that for @xmath105 there exists some critical value of the parameter @xmath339 , so that for @xmath340 the distribution @xmath6 has a bell - shaped form , but for @xmath341 it attains an @xmath22-shaped form with @xmath114 being the least probable value and two maxima close to the edges of the interval .",
    "this signifies that , despite the fact that @xmath5 has moments of arbitrary order , two identical searchers will arrive for the first time to the target at distinctly different times .",
    "consequently , in such a situation the _ mean _ first passage is not a proper measure of the search efficiency .",
    "we remind that such a form of @xmath5 is exact for a bm taking place on a semi - infinite one - dimensional line with a constant bias directed towards the target . for this physical situation",
    ", our result implies that two identical bms , starting at some point @xmath10 and having the same drift velocity @xmath220 and the same diffusion coefficient @xmath35 , will most likely arrive together to the target ( the origin ) if the peclet number latexmath:[$pe = x_0    on contrary , if @xmath221 , an event that these two bms arrive simultaneously to the target location is the _",
    "least _ probable event .    turning next to an unbiased bm on a finite interval",
    "@xmath243 $ ] we recall that @xmath61 should be proportional to @xmath343 and @xmath344 .",
    "hence , @xmath345 .",
    "this suggests a somewhat strange result that for two unbiased identical bms on a finite 1d interval the modality of the distribution should depend on how far is the starting point from the reflecting boundary . since @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ truncated_dist ] ) , which we have used for the derivation of this result , is an approximate form of the first passage time distribution , we have revisited this problem using exact forms of @xmath5 for a bm in 1d , 2d and 3d spherical domains with a reflecting boundary .",
    "we have shown that indeed , the very shape ( modality ) of the distribution @xmath6 depends on the ratio @xmath232 .    we have realized that for @xmath346 , where @xmath347 and @xmath348 for 1d , 2d and 3d , respectively , @xmath6 is an @xmath22-shaped function of @xmath14 with a minimum at @xmath114 so that here two unbiased identical bms will most probably arrive to the target location for the first time at distinctly different times . for @xmath349 ,",
    "the distribution has a maximum at @xmath114 so that , mathematically , the most probable event is that two bms arrive for the first time to the location of the target simultaneously .",
    "note , however , that @xmath6 is a `` bell - shaped '' function only in 1d ( although is still rather broad ) but in 2d and 3d , @xmath6 is nearly flat in an extended region around the maximum and rather abruptly vanishes in the vicinity of the edges of the interval .",
    "this signifies that here sample - to - sample fluctuations are very significant . in case",
    "when the starting point @xmath10 of two bms is uniformly distributed within the domain ( outside the target ) , we found that @xmath350 .",
    "this allows us to conclude that in neither of these well - studied situations ( apart of , with some reservations , 1d case with @xmath315 ) the mean first passage time of an individual searcher can be considered as a robust measure of the search process efficiency .",
    "we argue that a similar behavior will take place in finite 1d systems for fractional bm with arbitrary hurst index @xmath44 or for @xmath41-stable lvy flights with @xmath351 , and , more generally , for _ finite _ systems of ( not necessarily integer ) dimension @xmath48 with fractal dimension @xmath49 of random motion trajectories given that a ) @xmath352 ( compact exploration , @xmath353 ) or b ) @xmath56 ( non - compact exploration , @xmath354 ) but @xmath355 .",
    "we have evaluated @xmath6 in the case of three and more searchers with the exponentially - truncated first passage time distribution in eq .",
    "( [ truncated_dist ] ) .",
    "we have shown that for @xmath32 the distribution @xmath6 is a bell - shaped function of @xmath14 for any value of @xmath207 .",
    "next , we have demonstrated that for very small values of the ratio @xmath207 the distribution @xmath6 has a bell - shaped form with a maximum close to @xmath15 .",
    "further on , we have predicted the following sequence of regimes which can be observed upon gradually increasing @xmath207 ( the starting point @xmath10 of @xmath0 searchers is moving towards the location of the target ) : the most probable value @xmath133 of @xmath14 moves towards the origin .",
    "the value of the maximum , @xmath326 first decreases , passes through a minimal value and then starts to increase . at a certain threshold value of @xmath207 ,",
    "a second extremum emerges in the vicinity of @xmath120 , which then splits into a minimum and a maximum so that the distribution @xmath6 becomes a skewed @xmath22-shaped one .",
    "this signifies , as well , that for such a situation the _ mean _ first passage time of a given searcher is not a representative characteristic of the search process .    as a final observation",
    ", we note that one may encounter a power - law distribution with a more abrupt truncation , compared to the exponential function in eq .",
