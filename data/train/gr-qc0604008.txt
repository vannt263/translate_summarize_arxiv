    "it is very well - known that an inertial reference frame in a flat spacetime equips with a minkowski coordinates so that [ mink ] ds^2=c^2dt^2-dx^2-dy^2-dz^2 .    in the literature ,",
    "a uniformly accelerated reference frame is defined as a set of observers who remain at rest with respect to a given observer _",
    "alice _ who is accelerating at a constant rate with respect to the instantaneously comoving inertial frames@xcite .",
    "two observers _ alice _ and _ bob _ are said to be _ at rest _ with respect to each other if the time elapses on the clock of _ alice _ during the passage of a light signal from _",
    "alice _ to _ bob _ and back again always has the same value . by definition ,",
    "two observers who at each instant are moving with the same velocity @xmath1 with respect to an inertial frame will remain at rest only when @xmath1 is a constant .",
    "therefore , a set of observers who has a single acceleration is not said to constitute a uniformly accelerated reference frame . instead , a uniformly accelerated reference frame is usually described by rindler coordinate system@xcite [ rindler ] ds^2= ^2 d^2 - d^2 - dy^2 -dz^2 , or mller coordinate system@xcite@xcite [ moller ] ds ^2=(1+g ) ^2d ^2 -d",
    "^2- dy^2 -dz^2 , in which static observers at different places in the spacetime , whose spatial coordinates are constants , have different accelerations",
    ".    it should be noted , however , that such a kind of uniformly accelerated reference frame is not suitable to describe the frame consisting of a group of electrons in a uniform electric field or the motion of phonon in an accelerated crystalloid .",
    "on the other hand , when a clock experiences a uniform acceleration , its time elapses at different rate time to time .",
    "thus , to define ",
    "_ at rest _",
    "\" with the help of such a kind of clock is not without questions .",
    "the concept ` _ at rest _ ' of such a kind is quite different from that in the laboratory ( inertial ) frame .",
    "obviously , an alternative definition of ` _ at rest _ ' will lead to an alternative definition of a uniformly accelerated reference frame and thus an alternative , uniformly accelerated coordinate system .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall study a new kind of reference frame in which each observer moves with the same acceleration , which is thought to be unable to serve as an acceleration reference frame in ref . .",
    "since the reference frame have only constant parameter @xmath2 distinguishing from an inertial reference frame , we also refer to it as a uniformly accelerated reference frame .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rindler ] , the rindler spacetime is reviewed briefly . in sec .",
    "[ accref ] , uniformly accelerated reference frames in flat spacetime are introduced .",
    "[ temperature ] is a short discussion on the thermal property of the new uniformly accelerated reference frame . in the last section ,",
    "the concluding remarks are given .",
    "in rindler spacetime ( [ rindler ] ) , the 4-velocity of a particle standing at constant-@xmath3 is @xmath4 and its 4-acceleration is a^&:= & u^_u^=\\{0 , ^-1 , 0 , 0}. the magnitude of the acceleration is @xmath5 , which depends on the position of particle in the spacetime .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a constant .",
    "then the line - element ( [ rindler ] ) is written in the mller coordinates ( [ moller ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of the acceleration of a particle standing at constant-@xmath9 is [ acc - nu ] a = g 1+g . in particular , @xmath10 at @xmath11 .",
    "the horizon for ( [ moller ] ) is at @xmath12 . by definition , the  surface gravity \" on the horizon is@xcite : = _ _",
    "h ( va ) = g , where @xmath13 is the redshift factor , and the hawking temperature is [ t_h - nu ] t_h:= = g 2 .",
    "all above equations are rewritten in natural units . in si units which is used in the following discussion ,",
    "the line - elements ( [ rindler ] ) and ( [ moller ] ) , acceleration ( [ acc - nu ] ) , and hawking temperature ( [ t_h - nu ] ) may be written as [ rindler1 ] ds^2= ^2 d^2 - d^2 - dy^2 -dz^2 and [ rindler3 ] ds ^2= ( 1 + ) ^2 c^2d ^2 -d ^2 - dy^2 - dz^2 , [ acc ] a = g 1+g /c^2 , and [ t_h ] t_h = , respectively .",
    "it is obvious that the line - element ( [ rindler3 ] ) is more natural to describe an accelerated observer than eq.([rindler1 ] ) because eq.([rindler3 ] ) only contains the speed of light @xmath14 while eq.([rindler1 ] ) also contains the newtonian gravitational constant @xmath15 and planck constant @xmath16 which are not related to accelerated motion directly .    for metrics ( [ rindler ] ) and ( [ moller ] )",
    ", the congruence of trajectories of accelerated observers has vanishing expansion , spatial components of shear and twist@xcite .",
    "the non - zero components of shear and twist are only @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the distance between two static observers , _ alice _ and _ bob _ , measured in the comoving inertial frame always has the same value .",
    "now , we consider a uniformly accelerated reference frame consisting of a set of accelerated observers with proper acceleration @xmath2 in a given direction , say , in @xmath19direction , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . at @xmath20 ,",
    "the observers are at @xmath21 , where @xmath22 are minkowski coordinates of a flat spacetime .",
    "the trajectory of each observer is a hyperbola of same eccentricity but different asymptotes in the minkowski spacetime .",
    "namely , different observers have different horizons .",
    "[ fig : arfig ]        the trajectory of an accelerated observer with acceleration @xmath2 passing @xmath23 at @xmath24 is ( see , e.g.@xcite ) [ traj ] x(t)=x+ . since & = & 1 c + & = & + & = & = 0 , on the trajectory = 1 c ^1/2 .",
    "its integration under the initial condition that @xmath24 when @xmath25 is [ t - s ] t = c a . substituting it in eq.([traj ] ) , we obtain [ x - x]x(t)=x+ ( -1 ) . in order to get a line - element for the uniformly accelerated reference frame in the flat spacetime , we choose new coordinates @xmath26 so that dt & = & c dt [ 2time ] + dx & = & dx+ c c dt .",
    "the line - element of the flat spacetime can be written as [ accref ] ds^2 = c^2 d t^2 -2c c dtdx - dx^2-dy^2-dz^2 in terms of the new coordinates .",
    "this is the line - element for the uniformly accelerated reference frame with the acceleration @xmath2 .    to make sure that eq.([accref ] )",
    "describes an accelerated reference frame , let us consider an arbitrary static observer in the new coordinates such that u^= c(1 , 0 , 0 , 0 ) .",
    "the 4-acceleration a^&= & u^_u^= a c ^_0 + a c^_1 has the magnitude ( -g_a^a^)^1/2=a , which is independent of the position of a static observer in the spacetime .",
    "this is unlike the rindler spacetime in which the static observer at different place has different acceleration .",
    "therefore , we say that @xmath2 here is the acceleration of the accelerated reference frame and that @xmath27 constitutes an accelerated coordinate system .",
    "it is remarkable that the accelerated coordinate system differs from an inertial coordinate system only by a non - diagonal term . at the time origin , the concepts of space and time in an accelerated reference frame are identical to those of inertial observers .    it can be shown that such a kind of accelerating system is locally synchronizable at @xmath28 hyperplane@xcite .    in an inertial reference frame , the second law of mechanics reads m_0 c = f^. since the 4-velocity in an inertial reference frame , @xmath29 , and that in the accelerated reference frame whose origin is at rest with respect to the inertial reference frame at @xmath24 , @xmath30 , are related by u^_iner = u^_acc , which reads u^0_iner & = & u^0_acc c + u^1_iner & = & u^0_acc c + u^1_acc + u^2_iner & = & u^2_acc + u^3_iner & = & u^3_acc , & = & c + a c^3 ( u^0_acc)^2 c + & = & c + a c^3 ( u^0_acc)^2 c+ + & = & + & = & .similarly , f^0_iner & = & f^0_acc c + f^1_iner & = & f^0_acc c + f^1_acc + f^2_iner & = & f^2_acc + f^3_iner & = & f^3_acc.then , the second law in the accelerated reference frame becomes m_0 c&=&f^0_acc - m_0a c^2 ( u^0_acc)^2 c + m_0 c & = & f^1_acc - m_0a c^2 ( u^0_acc)^2 sech c + m_0 c&=&f^2_acc + m_0 c&=&f^3_acc .",
    "it can also be obtained directly from f^_acc = m_0 c , since m_0 c & = & m_0 c ( - 1 c ^_u^_acc u^_acc ) , + ^ _",
    "u^_acc u^_acc & = & a c^2 ( u^0_acc)^2 ( ^_0 + sech ^_1 ) .    in the newtonian approximation ,",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , the second law reduces to m_0 c = f^i_acc - m_0 a ^i_1 .",
    "it takes the standard form of the newtonian mechanics in an accelerated reference frame .",
    "in addition , in the newtonian approximation , eqs.([t - s ] ) and ( [ traj ] ) reduce to t = t , x = x+1 2 a t^2 .",
    "they are the standard relations between coordinates in an inertial and a uniformly accelerated system .",
    "in contrast , the second law of mechanics in the rindler metric ( [ rindler1 ] ) , m_0 c & = & f^_r - m_0 ^_u^_r u^_r + & = & f^_r- m_0 u^0_r[^-1 u^1_r ^_0 + u^0_r ^_1 ]",
    ". reduces to m_0",
    "c = f^i _ r- ^i_1 = f^i _ r- m_0 a()^i_1 . under the newtonian approximation , where the approximation @xmath35 has been used .",
    "it is not the standard form of the second law newtonian mechanics in an accelerated reference frame though the acceleration of constant-@xmath36 trajectory is @xmath37 .",
    "the second law of mechanics in the metric ( [ rindler3 ] ) does not reduce to the standard newtonian form in an accelerated reference frame either .",
    "now , let us study the thermal property of the line - element ( [ accref ] ) and consider its euclidean section . under the wick rotation t = it , s is_e^ the line - element ( [ accref ] ) becomes ds_e^2 & = & d^2 -2 c c ddx + dx^2 + dy^2+dz^2 . clearly , the metric spacetime has a period in @xmath38 direction .",
    "the period is @xmath39 namely , the time variable in line - element ( [ accref ] ) has the imaginary period @xmath40 on the same reasoning as that in ref .",
    ", the green function , as a function of coordinates , is expected to acquire the same period automatically .",
    "therefore , one may expect , according to the green s function theory at finite temperature@xcite , that the observers in the accelerated reference frame at uniform acceleration @xmath2 will observe the finite hawking temperature @xmath41 .    to confirm that the observer will observe the finite hawking temperature ,",
    "more systematic studies on the green s function are needed .",
    "but it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "instead , it is recalled that the vacuum green function for the detector with a uniform ( proper ) acceleration @xmath2 is the same as the thermal green function for an inertial detector with the temperature@xcite [ t ] t_h= , which leads to the conclusion that the uniformly acelerated detector in vacuum will detect a thermal bath of radiation at temperature @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the particle detectors moving along eq.([traj ] ) will all detect a thermal bath of radiation at the same temperature @xmath42 .",
    "a new kind of uniformly accelerated reference frame and the corresponding coordinate system is constructed . unlike the mller and rindler uniformly accelerated reference frames , the uniformly accelerated reference frame has a single acceleration parameter @xmath2 .",
    "although the distance between two observers standing in the reference frame may change , the reference frame has the following advantages :    first of all , all observers with @xmath43 in the reference frame are on equal footing",
    ". in particular , each observer in the reference frame has the same acceleration , and the reference frame has spatial translation invariance .",
    "the frame is the relativistic version of a uniformly accelerated reference in the sense of newtonian mechanics .",
    "so , it is easy to be understood .",
    "in contrast , in the mller and rindler uniformly accelerated reference frames there is no spatial translation invariance in the direction of acceleration .",
    "instead , it possesses the boost invariance .",
    "the observers in the frame are not equivalent to each other .",
    "therefore , they may be regarded as the uniformly accelerated reference frame in a small nearby region of a given observer .",
    "secondly , each observer in the new uniformly accelerated reference frame has its own horizon ( as shown in fig.1 ) .",
    "it is something like the comoving observers in friedmann - robertson - walker universe when horizon exists .",
    "on the other hand , all standing observers have the same horizon .",
    "it is similar to de sitter spacetime in the static coordinate system .",
    "thirdly , each particle detector detects the same temperature in the new uniformly accelerated reference frame .",
    "it is again something like the comoving observers in friedmann - robertson - walker universe , each of whom detects the same temperature of cosmic microwave background .",
    "[ fig : pieceacc ]        fourthly , the reference frame may pick up a particular inertial reference frame , the laboratory reference frame , in which the distance of two standing observers keeps always unchanged and observers ( or particles ) have the same instant velocity at any time ( the same temperature of different observers in a reference frame may also be used to define a special , simultaneous hypersurface , because the thermal equilibrium is closely related to the transitivity of simultaneity@xcite ) .",
    "it becomes clearer if a piecewise uniformly accelerated reference frame is considered , which is first at rest in the laboratory , inertial frame , and begins to be uniformly accelerated at @xmath24 , and finally settles down an inertial frame at @xmath44 with the final velocity v_f= .",
    "|_t_f = = at_f ( 1 + ) ^-1/2 with respect to the laboratory frame , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "the reference frame is more suitable than the mller or rindler uniformly reference frame to apply the particles in a linear accelerator , in which particles undergo the same acceleration , or the phonon in a uniformly accelerated crystalloid .",
    "the new frame can be used to study the  complicated fractional differences \" due to acceleration , which have been neglected in a small - enough accelerated frame@xcite .",
    "the inertial coordinates in the final inertial reference frame are related to the coordinates for the laboratory reference frame [ inertframetransf ] t&= & , + x&= & , + y&= & y , + z&=&z .",
    "it is easy to see from fig.2 that the distance between the two observers with the same acceleration in the laboratory frame keeps unchanged , while the distance in comoving frame varies from time to time .",
