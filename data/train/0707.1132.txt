    "in high - sensitive optical position meters , and , in particular , in laser interferometric gravitational - wave detectors , two kinds of optical quantum noises exist . the first one  _ measurement noise _ , known also as _ shot noise _  arises due to the optical field phase fluctuation .",
    "its spectral density @xmath1 is inversely proportional to the optical power @xmath2 circulating in the interferometer arms .",
    "the second one  _ back action _ , or _",
    "radiation - pressure _ noise  is a random force acting on test mass(es ) due to the optical field amplitude fluctuations .",
    "this noise spectral density @xmath3 is directly proportional to @xmath2 .    in the contemporary ( first ) generation of laser interferometric gravitational - wave detectors @xcite , the optical power is relatively small and the measurement noise dominates in all frequency band of interest . in the planned second generation detectors @xcite",
    "the circulating power will be about hundred times higher .",
    "correspondingly , sensitivity will be better at least by one order of magnitude .",
    "near the characteristic frequency @xmath4 it will be close to the standard quantum limit ( sql ) , _ i.e. _ the sensitivity level where the test mass response on the back - action force becomes equal to the measurement noise .",
    "it is well known that performance of laser interferometric gravitational - wave detectors can be improved by using squeezed quantum states of the optical field .",
    "preparation of optical field quantum states squeezed in gravitational - wave band ( 10 - 10000 hz ) presents a significant technical problem .",
    "however , now this problem can be considered as solved @xcite .    squeezed state inside the interferometer can be created by injection squeezed vacuum into the interferometer dark port . in this case , the shot noise will be suppressed by the price of increased radiation pressure noise , allowing to reach the sql using less optical power @xcite ( it has to be noted that the circulating power close to 1mw is planned for the second generation detectors ) . using a frequency - dependent squeezing angle @xcite , it is possible to obtain sensitivity better than the sql .",
    "the necessary dependence can be created , in particular , by reflecting squeezed vacuum ( before its injection into the interferometer ) from additional detuned filter cavities @xcite .",
    "however , this technology is very sensitive to the filter cavities optical losses .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain a significant sensitivity gain , very long ( kilometer - scale ) filter cavities are required .    an alternative method based on a different type of filter cavity was proposed in the article @xcite . in this method ( which will be referred by below as cmw ) , the filter cavity works as a high - pass filter for the squeezed light , creating light which is squeezed only at high side - band frequencies ( @xmath5 ) . in this case",
    ", the measurement noise will be reduced at high frequencies only , that is in the frequency domain where it dominates . at the same time",
    ", the back action noise will remain unchanged at low frequencies ( where it dominates ) , and will increase only at high frequencies , where its influence is negligible in comparison with the measurement noise . as a result , this method improves sensitivity at high frequencies , but does not affect it at low frequencies .",
    "it is important , that in the cmw procedure squeezed light does not enter into the filter cavity at high side - band frequencies , and at low side - band frequencies it simply passes through the filter cavity and not used in the measurement .",
    "therefore , the filter cavity losses could affect the sensitivity only in the relatively narrow intermediate frequencies area , and it is possible to expect , that the cmw scheme will be less sensitive to the filter cavity losses .",
    "estimates , presented in the article @xcite , shows , however , that this method performance is not as good as it could be expected , and there is a noticeable sensitivity degradation at medium frequencies  close to the filter cavity half - bandwidth @xmath6 ( see , for example , fig.3 of @xcite and fig.[fig : plot1 ] of the current paper ) .",
    "this degradation stems from the fact that there is a quantum entanglement between output optical fields of two filter cavity ports .",
    "it vanishes at low and high frequencies , where the input field simply passes through or reflects from the cavity , and reaches the maximum at frequencies around @xmath6 .",
    "it is well known that the quantum entanglement represent an informational resource .",
    "this resource is not used in the original cmw scheme . as a result",
    ", the redundant quantum noise arises .",
    "thus disadvantage was recognized in the article @xcite , and in order to reduce it , multiple filter cavities configurations was proposed . here",
    "we consider another more simple and effective method , see fig.[fig : scheme ] .",
    "the scheme proposed here differs from the original one ( see fig.1 of @xcite ) by the additional homodyne detector ahd attached to the filter cavity idle port . due to the quantum entanglement ,",
    "output signal of this detector contains information about both the shot and the radiation pressure noises .",
    "therefore , adding it to the output of the main homodyne detector mhd with an optimal weight function , it is possible to remove the redundant noise , substantially improving the sensitivity at medium frequencies .",
    "in sec.[sec : noises ] , quantum noises of this scheme is calculated and it is shown that the additional detector allows to reach the fundamental minimum of this noise . in sec.[sec : sensitivity ] , the scheme sensitivity is estimated for different values of the optical power and the interferometer bandwidth .    for simplicity , we suppose here that the interferometer is tuned in resonance , _",
    "i.e. _ , the `` optical springs '' technology @xcite is not used .",
    "we suppose also , that there are no optical losses in the main interferometer itself , and take into account only losses in the filter cavity .",
    "this approximation is justified by the fact that contemporary and planned gravitational - wave detectors have kilometer - scale arm cavities , while the filter cavity length in the setup considered in article @xcite and here is supposed to be about a few tens of meters ( it is well known that the optical losses influence is inversely proportional to the cavity length ) .",
    "we take into account , however , non - unity quantum efficiency of the photodetectors , which significantly cripples performance of the squeezed states based schemes .    the main notations and parameters values used in this paper are listed in table[tab : notations ] . for the consistency with the quantum theory of measurements , the `` double - sided '' definition of the noises spectral densities used in this paper . however , for the equivalent strain noise spectral density @xmath7 , the `` single - sided '' definition standard for the gravitational - wave community is used [ see eq.([s^h ] ) ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ tab : results ] , numerical estimates of the sensitivity are presented .",
    "two criteria are used in this table .",
    "the first one is the signal to noise ratio for neutron star - neutron star ( nsns ) inspiral waveforms @xcite , normalized by the value corresponding to the conventional ( unsqueezed ) interferometer with @xmath8 and @xmath9 : @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the gravitational - wave detector low - frequency cut - off , and @xmath12 is the gravitational - wave frequency corresponding to the innermost stable circular orbit of a schwarzchild black hole with mass equal to @xmath13 solar masses .",
    "this criterion characterizes the low - frequency sensitivity .",
    "the second criterion is the sensitivity for high - frequency periodic sources , which is simply the reciprocal value of the noise spectral density at some given frequency .",
    "similar to @xcite , we use frequencies @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and normalize the noise by the value corresponding to the conventional unsqueezed interferometer with @xmath8 and @xmath9 : @xmath16      the choice of @xmath8 , while convenient for comparison with the simplest unsqueezed sql - limited case , does not provide the best results .",
    "increasing not just the optical power but also the interferometer bandwidth , it is possible to improve the sensitivity at high frequencies without sacrifying the low - frequency sensitivity .",
    "really , it follows from eqs.([s_sum_org],[s_sum ] ) , that the low- and - high frequency asymptotics of the quantum noise spectral density are equal to @xmath17      \\dfrac{\\omega^2}{2j\\gamma}\\,e^{-2r } \\",
    ", , & \\omega\\to\\infty \\ , .    \\end{cases}\\ ] ] therefore , if @xmath18 increases proportionally to @xmath19 , then the low - frequency asymptotic of @xmath20 remains unchanged , and the high - frequency one decreases proportionally to @xmath21 .",
    "this consideration is illustrated by fig.[fig : plot3 ] , where the quantum noise spectral density is plotted for the same values of the optical power as in fig.[fig : plot2 ] , but for proportionally increased values of @xmath18 .",
    "the corresponding numerical estimates are also shown in table [ tab : results ] ( see the last two rows ) .    ,",
    "( b ) @xmath22 , ( c ) @xmath23 .",
    "solid : @xmath24 , dashes : @xmath25 .",
    "( d ) the sum quantum noise of the advanced ligo ; ( e ) the sum technical noise of the advanced ligo.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "these estimates show that using the amplitude filter based scheme of @xcite in combination with the additional homodyne detector and the broadened interferometer configuration , it is possible to obtain sensitivity which is comparable with or better that the one planned for the advanced ligo at low frequencies , and substantially better at high frequencies , using @xmath26 or even @xmath27 times less optical power . taking into account that 6db squeezing in gravitational waves frequency band is available now @xcite , and very probably 10db squeezing will be available in the next few years , and taking also into account numerous hassles which stem from very high optical power planned for the next generation gravitational - wave detectors , the use of some squeezed states / amplitude filters based scheme with reduced power , similar to the one considered here , probably , could be the better option .    however , it has to be noted that the use of squeezed states imposes additional technical problems of its own . in particular , the estimates presented in this paper show , that the photodetectors non - unity quantum efficiency @xmath28 substantially limits the squeezed states based scheme performance , replacing , in effect , the noise depression factor @xmath29 by the value @xmath30 for example , if @xmath24 , then the effective squeeze factor @xmath31 can not exceed @xmath32 even if @xmath33 .",
