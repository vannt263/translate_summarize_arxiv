    "the detection of high - redhifted ( @xmath0 ) millimeter co lines in the hyperluminous object iras 10214 + 4724 ( @xmath1 , brown & vanden bout 1992 , solomon et al .",
    "1992a ) , has opened a new way of research to tackle the star formation history of the universe .",
    "although the object turned out to be highly gravitationally amplified , it revealed however that galaxies at this epoch could have large amounts of molecular gas , excited by an important starburst , and sufficiently metal - enriched to emit detectable co emission lines . the latter bring fundamental information about the cold gas component in high - z objects and therefore about the physical conditions of the formation of galaxies and the first generations of stars . at high enough redshifts ,",
    "most of the galaxy mass could be molecular .",
    "the main problem to detect this molecular component could be its low metallicity , but theoretical calculations have shown that in a violent starburst , the metallicity could reach solar values very quickly ( elbaz et al . 1992 ) .",
    "after the first discovery , many searches for other candidates took place , but they were harder than expected , and only a few , often gravitationally amplified , objects have been detected : the lensed cloverleaf quasar h 1413 + 117 at @xmath2 ( barvainis et al . 1994 ) , the lensed radiogalaxy mg0414 + 0534 at @xmath3 ( barvainis et al .",
    "1998 ) , the possibly magnified object br1202 - 0725 at @xmath4 ( ohta et al .",
    "1996 , omont et al .",
    "1996a ) , the amplified submillimeter - selected hyperluminous galaxies",
    "smm02399 - 0136 at @xmath5 ( frayer et al .",
    "1998 ) , and smm 14011 + 0252 at 2.565",
    "( frayer et al . 1999 ) , and the magnified bal quasar apm08279 + 5255 , at @xmath6 , where the gas temperature derived from the co lines is @xmath7 200k , maybe excited by the quasar ( downes et al .",
    "recently scoville et al .",
    "( 1997b ) reported the detection of the first non - lensed object at @xmath8 , the weak radio galaxy 53w002 , and guilloteau et al .",
    "( 1997 ) the radio - quiet quasar bri 1335 - 0417 , at @xmath9 , which has no direct indication of lensing .",
    "if the non - amplification is confirmed , these objects would contain the largest molecular contents known ( 8 - 10 10@xmath10 m@xmath11 with a standard co / h@xmath12 conversion ratio , and even more if the metallicity is low ) .",
    "the derived molecular masses are so high that h@xmath12 would constitute between 30 to 80% of the total dynamical mass ( according to the unknown inclination ) , if the standard co / h@xmath12 conversion ratio was adopted .",
    "the application of this conversion ratio is however doubtful , and it is possible that the involved h@xmath12 masses are 3 - 4 times lower ( solomon et al . 1997 ) .    obviously , the search of co lines in high - z objects is still a challenge for present day instrumentation , but this will rapidly change with the new millimeter instruments planned over the world ( the green - bank-100 m of nrao , the lmt-50 m of umass - inaoe , the lsa - mma ( europe / usa ) and the lmsa ( japan ) interferometers ) .",
    "it is therefore interesting to predict with simple models the detection capabilities , as a function of redshift , metallicity or physical conditions in the high - z objects . in particular",
    ", it would be highly interesting to detect not only the few exceptional amplified monsters in the sky , but also the widely spread normal galaxy population of the young universe .",
    "our aim here is to determine to which redshift it will be possible , and with which instrument .",
    "a previous study has already modelled galaxies at very high redshift ( up to @xmath13 ) and concluded that co lines could be even more easy to detect than the continuum ( silk & spaans 1997 ) .",
    "our models do not agree with this conclusion .",
    "section 2 describes the two - component model we use for the molecular clouds of the starburst galaxies , section 3 the cosmological model ; both are combined and the results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "section 5 describes the detection perspectives with the future millimeter instruments .",
    "since the physical conditions of the interstellar medium is still unknown in early galaxies , the most straightforward modeling is to extrapolate what we know from the local star - forming clouds in the milky way .",
    "solomon et al . (",
    "1990 ) showed that the ism of ultra - luminous starbursting galaxies is likely to contain a large fraction of dense gas , corresponding to the star - forming cores of local molecular clouds .",
    "the gross features of the co and far - infrared emissions of these luminous starbursts can be explained by a dense ( average density 10@xmath14 @xmath15 ) molecular component confined in the central kpc , containing cores of even higher density ( @xmath7 10@xmath16 @xmath15 ) .",
    "these are about 100 times denser than in a normal galactic disk . the fir to co luminosity ratio are nearly those expected for an optically thick region radiating as a black - body ( solomon et al .",
    "typical masses of molecular gas are 2 - 6 10@xmath10 m@xmath11 .",
    "the dominant dust component in ultra - luminous galaxies has a temperature between 30 and 50 k , while there is sometimes a higher temperature emission bump ( e.g. klaas et al .",
    "the emission peaks around 100@xmath17 m with a flux of 1 - 3 jy at @xmath18 . at the higher redshifts of @xmath19 ,",
    "continuum fluxes of a few mjy have been detected at 1.25 mm ( e.g. omont et al .",
    "1996b ) , corresponding to dust emission at about 220@xmath17 m , with gas masses up to 10@xmath20 m@xmath11 if no gravitational lens is present .",
    "as for the co lines , they are more difficult to detect with present day instrumentation , and most of the 8 detections reported so far are gravitationally magnified .",
    "the flux detected range between 3 to 20 mjy for lines ( 3 - 2 ) to ( 7 - 6 ) ( see table [ codata ] ) .",
    "the following sensitivities were used , for one second integration time : 50mjy ( iram-30 m at 1250@xmath17 m ) ; + 1200 , 530 , 80 and 60mjy ( jcmt - scuba , at 350 , 450 , 850 and 1350@xmath17 m respectively ) ; + 30mjy ( cso - bolocam at 1100@xmath17 m ) ; 1.3mjy ( lmt - bolocam at 1100@xmath17",
    "m ) ; + 2 and 0.7 mjy ( lsa - mma at 850 and 1250@xmath17 m , respectively ) [ cont - h ]    the results in tables [ line - h ] and [ cont - h ] are of course only orders of magnitude , since they depend on the starburst model , and also the technical performances of planned instruments are only extrapolated .",
    "but they give already a good insight in what will be feasible in the next decade .",
    "the continuum sources are already detectable with present instruments at all redshifts .",
    "large interferometers will be necessary to reduce the confusion level , and map the sources .",
    "the co lines are presently not detectable easily at redshifts larger than 1 .",
    "the few detections already published at high @xmath21 owe their detection to the high magnification factor provided by a gravitational lens , or to exceptionally massive objects .",
    "for instance , the actual integrated intensity of br 1335 - 0414 , 2.8 @xmath22 0.3 jy km / s at @xmath23 4.4 , guilloteau et al 1997 ) is a factor 9 larger than our standard model at @xmath23 5 , at 3 mm . with the future instruments",
    ", they will be detectable easily up to @xmath24 and may be larger , if huge starbursts exist there . at @xmath25 , it will be possible to detect co lines from more normal galaxies , and to tackle star formation in those very young galaxies .",
    "more exotic lines , such as cs , hcn , or even h@xmath12o will then be available to explore the physics of the interstellar medium and star formation in more detail .",
