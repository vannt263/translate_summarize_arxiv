    "the problem of calculating the dynamics of quantum spin chains has acquired new importance due to potential new applications in spintronics  @xcite , quantum information , computation and control theory and the now realistic possibility of doing experiments on systems that are accurately described by a one - dimensional array of spins  @xcite .",
    "the development of time - dependent versions of the successful density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method of white @xcite by several authors @xcite therefore comes at a fortuitous moment .",
    "all numerical schemes for a quantum many - body problem such as a spin chain necessarily involve a drastic reduction of the high - dimensional hilbert space to a suitable subspace of relatively modest dimension . the dmrg method does this by approximating the desired states ( typically the ground state and low - lying excitations above it ) by finitely correlated states @xcite , also known as generalized valence bond states or matrix product states .",
    "the time - dependent dmrg method extends this idea by allowing the subspace used in the approximation scheme to depend on time .",
    "here we are interested in the dynamics of the heisenberg xxz chain with kink boundary conditions @xcite and a time - dependent external field .",
    "the ground states of this model are the so - called kink states which describe an interface between domains of opposite magnetization .",
    "their degeneracy grows with the length of the chain @xcite , and is labelled by the position of the kink , or equivalently , the total magnetization which is a conserved quantity . a transverse external field localized at one site",
    "can be used to select a unique ground state @xcite , i.e. , such a perturbation pins the kink at a specific site .",
    "these interface structures also appear in certain asymmetric simple exclusion models of stochastic particle dynamics @xcite and it is a natural question to study their non - equilibrium properties . in this paper",
    "we study the quantum dynamics of the kink under the influence of a time - dependent magnetic field .",
    "typically we use a field supported at one or two sites and moving at a constant speed . for small velocities , we know by the adiabatic theorem that the time - evolution of a ground state will follow the ground state of the time - dependent hamiltonian . the standard heuristic scale to identify the adiabatic regime is the smallness of the ratio of the time - derivative of the hamiltonian over the spectral gap squared .",
    "we will verify the usefulness of this criterion by calculating the time evolution of kink states in the xxz chain under the influence of a time - dependent magnetic field .",
    "needless to say , the dynamics of kink states , which can be regarded as discrete analogues of solitons , is of great interest in its own right .",
    "moreover , they provide a simple dynamical quantum model of sharp magnetic domain walls .    in order to numerically study the quality of the adiabatic approximation and its domain of validity , it is necessary to express the evolved state in the time - dependent eigenbasis of the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore we construct the dmrg basis at time @xmath0 starting from the ground state(s ) and low - lying excited states of the hamiltonian of the system at time @xmath0 .",
    "this is in contrast with the original method , where the time - dependent dmrg basis is obtained from the evolved state at time @xmath0 .",
    "our method can be of more general interest , since the calculation of the dmrg basis is a separate calculation about which we can be confident to have good control , regardless of the potential difficulties in reliably calculating the time evolution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ] , we define the model and study its basic properties . the adiabatic approximation is studied in section [ sect : adiabatic ] . in section [ sec : fast - change - magnetic ] , we give a brief discussion of the issues that arise with rapidly changing magnetic fields .",

    "we are in the adiabatic regime if @xmath230 . since for small @xmath56 , the adiabatic constant @xmath149 is inverse proportional to @xmath56 , we require @xmath231 . for large @xmath56 we know that @xmath149 is proportional to @xmath56 and thus we want that @xmath232",
    "the regime where the initial state is stationary is simply given by the condition that @xmath233 .",
    "we have studied the propagation of a magnetic domain wall in the ferromagnetic heisenberg chain due to a time dependent magnetic field .",
    "this situation is of immediate interest in submicrometer magnetic wires  @xcite and in establishing ferromagnetic gates  @xcite . in the simplest case ,",
    "the magnetic field is localized near the center of the domain wall ( say at site @xmath129 ) and then moved along the chain to site @xmath234 . if its velocity is small then we are in the adiabatic regime and the domain wall is shifted from @xmath129 to @xmath234 thereby preserving its shape .",
    "we find that there is an optimal region of the strength of @xmath56-fields for which the domain wall mobility is highest and is reduced for large and small @xmath56-fields .    on top of an analytical study using the standard adiabatic theorem and based upon properties of the heisenberg model that have been proved in recent years ,",
    "we have performed a numerical study .",
    "the latter is a variation of the recently developed time - dependent density matrix renormalization group method .",
    "this allows us to follow the schrdinger time evolution of the domain wall with high accuracy in the adiabatic as well as the non - adiabatic regime , and discuss in detail the dependence on the parameters of our model such as the strength and speed of the magnetic field and the coupling constant in the heisenberg interaction .",
    "the dmrg algorithms for ground state @xcite as well as time - dependent @xcite computations are well known , see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , degeneracy and non - translation invariance of the ground states of the ( translation invariant ) xxz kink hamiltonian require a few non - standard adaptations . to lift degeneracy , we restrict to a sector of fixed total @xmath118-magnetization .",
    "for a chain of even length , the ground state with total magnetization zero has an interface centered in between the two middle sites .",
    "this state can be grown in the usual way by successively inserting two sites in the middle and targeting the zero magnetization state at each step . for a kink state with non - zero magnetization , we grow the system initially in the zero magnetization sector . if eventually a total magnetization with interface close to the middle is needed , we perform the finite system convergence sweeps in the new sector , with the zero magnetization state as initial trial state . if an interface close to one of the edges is needed , we grow the system at the right moment by targeting a magnetization sector which increases or decreases with one each step ( effectively inserting two up or two down spins in the middle , thus shifting the kink to the right or left )",
    ". the dmrg enlarging process implicitly assumes a translation invariant hamiltonian .",
    "however , if the breaking of translation invariance is due to a local perturbation as in our case ( with external magnetic fields located on one or two sites ) , we can grow the system targeting the zero magnetization kink , and add the perturbation for the finite system convergence sweeps where translation invariance is no longer needed .",
    "the dmrg state thus obtained converges indeed very rapidly to the true ground state @xmath145 of the perturbed hamiltonian at time @xmath122 .    in the standard time - dependent dmrg , adaptation of the basis is done by computing and truncating new reduced density matrices for the evolved state @xmath143 . here",
    "the situation is different because we need to compute both the time evolved state @xmath143 and the true ground state @xmath87 of @xmath98 ( in the same dmrg basis , naturally ) .",
    "therefore we use the ground state ( or several low - lying states ) of @xmath98 to adapt the hilbert spaces .",
    "the details of our algorithm are as follows .",
    "the time period @xmath235 $ ] is first divided in @xmath236 time steps of length @xmath237 by discretizing the time evolution , i.e. , the evolved states @xmath143 are defined by @xmath238 each of these time steps is further divided into @xmath239 smaller steps of length @xmath240 for the trotter decomposition , so @xmath241 and @xmath242 is expanded by @xmath243 such that each factor acts on two sites which are successively represented exactly in a dmrg sweeping process .",
    "note that only the interaction @xmath244 is time - dependent .",
    "we shall call the so approximated state @xmath245 .",
    "let us start at time @xmath179 where @xmath246 .",
    "to apply @xmath247 to it we need to have @xmath145 written in a dmrg basis that represents the low energy states of @xmath248 . to this end",
    "we use @xmath125 as an initial trial state and apply standard finite system dmrg sweeps targeting the ground state @xmath249 of @xmath248 , and update @xmath145 along the way . at the end of the sweeps we have a new dmrg basis for @xmath248 , its ground state @xmath249 , and @xmath145 expressed in the new basis .",
    "this is the _ adaptive _ part of our algorithm . next we can apply @xmath247 to the new representation of @xmath145 using the trotter sweeping process and obtain the evolved state @xmath250 . by construction @xmath250 and @xmath249",
    "are expressed in the same dmrg basis , and their overlap and other quantities can be computed .",
    "the subsequent time steps proceed in exactly the same manner .",
    "although the motivation for adapting the dmrg bases in this way is inspired by the question to analyze the adiabatic approximation , we have found that it is also very convenient to compute the time - evolved state in the non - adiabatic regime . in this case , we need to target more low - energy states , but we do not need to increase the block dimension , unlike standard time - dependent dmrg which needs approximately twice the block dimension of ground state dmrg to achieve the same accuracy @xcite .",
    "our problem is suitable for dmrg with small block dimension as its entanglement entropy @xcite goes to zero for large intervals around the support of the magnetic field perturbation ( it is exactly zero for the non - perturbed hamiltonian due to its frustration free property ) .",
    "the algorithm converges up to machine precision to the true , known energies of the ground state and first excited state with the number of kept states ( block dimension ) as low as @xmath251 for a chain of length @xmath115 .",
    "we carried out 3 system sweeps to obtain convergence of the ground states and of the dmrg bases at each time step .",
    "for given @xmath161 , the final time @xmath197 was divided in time steps of length @xmath173 which were further subdivided into @xmath252 trotter steps . for the ground state and adiabatic transport computations , we targeted the @xmath253 lowest energy states of @xmath98 to construct the dmrg basis , increasing to the @xmath254 lowest energy states for the fast changing magnetic field .",
    "a straightforward error analysis shows that @xmath255 , where @xmath256 it the adiabatic constant computed using the trotter approximation to the time - evolved state , @xmath149 is the true adiabatic constant , and @xmath257 .    we have implemented the ground state and time - dependent dmrg algorithms in a matlab toolbox which can be easily applied to other models as well .",
