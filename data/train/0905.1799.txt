    "power - law distributions are quite common in nature : earthquakes and micro - fractures , solar flares , weather records , snow avalanches , crackling , and @xmath0 noise are just a few examples of systems displaying scale - invariance @xcite .",
    "many of these , among many others , have been claimed to be critical , i.e. to lie at , or very close to , a critical point , which ensues scale - invariance and the concomitant power - law distributions .",
    "it is worth stressing that power - laws ( or approximate power - laws ) emerging from the complex interactions of many - component systems placed at the vicinity of a critical point and , therefore , with diverging correlation lengths and the associated power - law decay of temporal and spatial correlations , should be clearly distinguished from other power - law distributions arising in many different contexts ( word distributions , city populations , citations , etc ) .",
    "these latter can be generated by a wealth of _ non - critical mechanisms _ as , for instance , multiplicative noise or fragmentation processes ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) , without the need to invoke criticality .    for a system to be critical",
    ", it does not suffice to have power - law distributed observables but , more crucially , it has to obey * finite - size scaling * : measurements at various system - sizes ( scales ) can be related to each other by re - scaling variables and quantities in some specific `` scale - invariant '' way ( i.e. scaling collapses can be performed ) .    given that , in standard phase transitions ( both in equilibrium and away from it )",
    ", a precise parameter tuning is required to reach criticality and generate power - law distributed quantities , an alternative explanation for the emergence of generic critical scale - invariance ( i.e. criticality occurring without requiring fine - tuning ) was historically much needed @xcite .",
    "how does criticality emerge spontaneously ?    in a seminal paper , bak , tang and wiesenfeld ( btw )",
    "@xcite introduced , back in @xmath1 , the concept of * self - organized criticality * ( soc ) @xcite aimed at solving the previous conundrum . the research line opened by",
    "their breakthrough work continues to attract , more than twenty years after , a great deal of interest .",
    "from this perspective , the overwhelming activity generated in the last decade around _ scale - free networks _",
    "@xcite can be certainly considered as a prominent extension of preceding research on soc .",
    "a handful of mechanisms were proposed under the common name of soc to justify the abundant presence of scale - invariance in the natural world .",
    "the most successful among them is the one exemplified by the original btw * sandpile model*. many variations of the btw sandpile were proposed : the manna sandpile @xcite , the oslo rice - pile model @xcite , and the zhang model @xcite , are just a few of them . for the sake of completeness and for future reference , a brief description of the best - known prototypical soc models is provided in appendix a. other possible mechanisms , as _ extremal dynamics _",
    "@xcite , have been studied , but we shall not be concerned with them here .",
    "the idea inspiring sandpiles , ricepiles , and related soc models is that many systems in nature , when pushed / driven slowly , respond very irregularly with rapid re - arrangements ( avalanches , bursts ) of a broad variety of sizes .",
    "the distribution of such avalanches is scale - invariant in many cases .",
    "of course , sandpile soc models are too simplistic to reproduce the detailed behavior of real sand - piles ; they can be regarded as ",
    "metaphors  capturing only some particular features of real systems in a stylized manner .",
    "nevertheless , after many ( partially ) failed attempts @xcite power - laws for avalanche in real granular piles , obeying finite - size scaling , were experimentally measured @xcite . moreover , other physical situations , as vortex avalanches in type - ii superconductors , can be mimicked as sandpiles , and their critical properties rationalized in terms of these @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a generic sandpile model can be synthesized as follows : some type of `` energy '' or `` stress '' ( sand - grains ) is progressively injected in discrete units ( i.e. grains are dropped singly ) at the sites of a spatially extended system ( usually a two - dimensional square lattice ) at a slow timescale .",
    "whenever a certain threshold of local energy is overcome , the corresponding site becomes unstable and its accumulated energy is redistributed at a much faster timescale among its neighbor sites .",
    "these , on their turn , can become unstable , and trigger a cascade of re - arrangements , i.e. an * avalanche * or outburst of activity .",
    "local redistribution rules are conserving in sandpiles : energy does not dissappear , but only diffuses around .",
    "open boundaries are customarily considered to allow for energy release from the system .",
    "once all activity ceases ( i.e. the avalanche stops ) new energy is injected ( i.e. a grain is dropped ) into the system , and so on , until a statistically stationary state is reached .",
    "in such a steady state avalanches are scale invariant , i.e their sizes / times are power - law distributed up to a maximum scale imposed by the system size : the system `` self - organizes '' to a critical point @xcite .",
    "moreover , the associated power spectrum exhibit @xmath2 noise @xcite .    for the sake of generality , let us fix a nomenclature common to all models discussed in this paper : `` *",
    "energy * '' refers to the accumulated and transported magnitude and `` * activity * '' describes `` energy above threshold '' . in some cases ,",
    "sites below threshold will be sub - classified in two groups : _ critical _ , which can become active upon receiving one input of energy ( for instance , one grain ) and _ stable _ , which can not @xcite .",
    "an essential ingredient of soc is * slow driving * ( driving and dynamics operating at two infinitely separated timescales @xcite , i.e. avalanches are instantaneous relative to the timescale of driving ) .",
    "such an infinite separation is usually achieved by driving the system only when all activity has stopped , but not during avalanches . for any _ finite _ separation of timescales , a finite characteristic ( time / size )",
    "scale appears ; hence , slow driving is a crucial requirement for generic scale - invariance to emerge @xcite .",
    "it was soon emphasized that * energy conservation * is also a key player for criticality to emerge in sandpile models @xcite .",
    "note that by `` conserving system '' one can refer either to models with bulk conserving dynamics and boundary dissipation , or to cases with a bulk dissipation rate vanishing in the large system size limit @xcite .",
    "various relatively simple arguments were proposed to rationalize the existence of true criticality in the steady state of _ conserving _ self - organized systems ( some of them are briefly discussed in the next section ) .",
    "however , these arguments can not be easily extended to similar non - conserving systems .",
    "in particular , different works have shown that the level of dissipation acts as a relevant parameter in the renormalization group sense : any degree of bulk dissipation breaks criticality in sandpile models @xcite .",
    "still , given the large variety of natural phenomena exhibiting ( exact or approximate ) scale - invariance in which some form of dissipation is inevitably present ( i.e. systems without any obvious conserved quantity ) , alternative mechanisms for self - organization to criticality in the absence of conservation were needed to achieve a comprehensive picture of generic scale - invariance @xcite .",
    "two acclaimed non - conserving self - organized models , or better , two _ families of models _ proposed to fill the gap between theoretical understanding and empirical facts are earthquake and forest - fire models ( see appendix a for definitions ) .",
    "these are highly non - trivial , and interesting models with rich and complex phenomenology .",
    "owing to the lack of solid theoretical arguments , analogous to the ones sketched above for conserving systems , and despite of numerical evidence showing power - laws for some decades , the existence of true generic scale - invariance in them has been long controversial .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to review exhaustively the large body of interesting literature devoted to non - conserving soc models , some aspects of which remain unsettled .",
    "but , let us just underline that the state - of - the - art is , as documented in the next section , that _ none of the considered non - conserving models is truly critical ; they just show `` apparent scale - invariance '' or `` dirty criticality '' for some decades_.    however , this final conclusion has not been sufficiently stressed and it has certainly not permeated the literature .",
    "this is likely due to the absence of a general theory , which may suggest that the results discussed above are specific to each particular model .",
    "indeed , works continue to be published assuming or claiming true criticality for soc non - conserving systems . for instance , in @xcite an interesting and solvable `` non - conserving model of soc '' was proposed and studied analytically . in a more recent series of papers , juanico and collaborators claim to have constructed different non - conserving self - organizing models with applications in various fields ( as neuroscience , population dynamics , etc . )",
    "also , in a recent work , levina _",
    "_ propose a non - conserving soc model for _ neural avalanches _ to capture the apparent scale - free behavior of avalanches of activity observed experimentally in networks of cortical neurons @xcite .",
    "an exhaustive analysis of this last model , as well as a study of the possible relation between soc and neural avalanches , is left for a separate publication .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to put together some previously existing results , scattered in the literature , ( although this is not intended to be an exhaustive review article ) and , more importantly , to rationalize the conclusion that none of the above mentioned non - conserving models , nor variations of them , exhibits true criticality , within a _",
    "unified framework_. to this end , we rely on different types of analytical arguments complemented by computer simulations . in passing ,",
    "we shall report on a number of new results and present a critical discussion on the existence of true scale - invariance in nature .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows : in section [ uno ] , we briefly review conserving and non - conserving models of soc , as well as some arguments to justify the existence of criticality in the first group . in the remaining sections ,",
    "we elucidate the existence or not of criticality in non - conserving systems using different approaches of increasing complexity .",
    "in particular , in section [ zeroth ] , we discuss a simple mean - field approach based on an energy balance equation ; it is useful to illustrate some key concepts as the `` loading mechanism '' . in section [ sobp ]",
    ", we study a self - consistent mean - field approximation , namely the so - called _ self - organized branching process _ ; it serves as an adequate benchmark to scrutinize the effects of dissipation and `` loading '' in critical self - organization . in section [ langevin ] ,",
    "we present ( and briefly review ) the langevin theory of conserving soc systems .",
    "it constitutes a solid basis to implement dissipation and loading in a systematic way and to provide clear evidence on the lack of criticality in non - conserving models .",
    "finally , the conclusions and a critical discussion of the implications of our main results are presented in section [ last ] .",
    "as said above , different type of arguments of different nature justify the existence of true criticality in conserving soc models .",
    "some of them are as follows :    * the energy , introduced into a pile at generic sites , can reach the boundaries ( and , thus , be dissipated ) only by means of the diffusive transport of grains occurring during avalanches . owing to this , and provided that a steady state exists , arbitrarily large avalanches ( of all possible sizes ) should exist for an arbitrarily large system size , ensuing a power - law size - distribution .",
    "contrarily , in the presence of non - vanishing bulk - dissipation , energy disappears at some finite rate , and avalanches stop after some characteristic lifetime / size determined by the dissipation rate @xcite . +",
    "this type of argument , even if commonly used in the literature , is ( at best ) incomplete , and can be misleading . it does not consider the possibility of having a characteristic scale larger than the system size , which would allow for avalanches to reach the boundaries . actually , this is what happens in many real sandpiles ( with inertial effects ) : energy is dissipated quasi - periodically in large system - wide avalanches rather than in scale - invariant avalanches ( see the chapter on experimental set - ups of sandpiles in @xcite or @xcite ) . * from a more abstract viewpoint ( not referring specifically to sandpiles or soc ) , energy conservation follows from the existence of a continuous symmetry ( in this case , _ temporal translational invariance _ ) as a consequence of noether s theorem @xcite .",
    "this also holds the other way around : time translational invariance implies energy conservation . when energy conservation is violated , the corresponding symmetry is broken and a characteristic ( finite ) time - scale appears generically . * from a field - theoretical perspective , in order to have scale - invariance , generic infrared divergences are required .",
    "but these are generically lost in the presence of a non - vanishing linear `` mass '' term ( adopting the field - theory jargon ) as , for instance , a dissipative term . in particular , if a term @xmath3 , is introduced into the simplest mesoscopic equation for a diffusive field @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a zero - mean gaussian white noise , a simple calculation reveals that the equal time two - point correlation function can be written as @xmath7 for @xmath8 much larger than the correlation length @xmath9 .",
    "accordingly , it is only for @xmath10 that @xmath11 diverges , the exponential cut - off disappears , and the correlation function decays algebraically ; for any non - vanishing value of @xmath12 there is a _ size - independent _ exponential cut - off .",
    "something similar occurs for other correlation functions .",
    "+ note that the noise in eq.([lang_cons ] ) is not fully conserving , but only conserving on average ( i.e. conservation needs only to hold on average to preserve scale invariance @xcite ) .",
    "the same conclusions can be also deduced for an equation analogous to eq.([lang_cons ] ) but with a strictly conserving noise ( see @xcite ) . *",
    "last but not least , a mesoscopic langevin equation that captures the critical properties of stochastic sandpiles and related models with a conservation law has been proposed @xcite .",
    "it describes systems with many absorbing states ( which correspond to the many stable microscopic configurations of a sandpile ) and a conservation law .",
    "while a detailed description of this is left for a forthcoming section , we just stress here that it constitutes a sound field theoretical representation of conserving soc , reproducing all critical exponents .",
    "the underlying mechanism of soc , highlighted by this theory , can not be straightforwardly generalized to non - conserving systems without including an additional fine tuning ( as we shall show in section [ langevin ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "_ there exists solid theoretical ground to underpin the existence of true criticality in conserving self - organized systems .",
    "the same type of arguments can not be easily extended to non - conserving systems_. in particular , as said already , non - conservative sandpiles have been explicitly shown to be non - critical .",
    "the two main prototypical non - conserving `` self - organized '' models ( or families of models ) , studied profusely in the literature , are ( see appendix a ) :    * * earthquake models * as the olami - feder - christensen ( ofc ) @xcite and related ones @xcite , in which the degree of dissipation can be explicitely controlled , and for which conservation is preserved only for some specific choice of a parameter .",
    "* * forest fire * models as the drossel - schwabl automaton @xcite ( and earlier versions of it @xcite ) , in which there is no conserved quantity whatsoever .",
    "together with bulk - dissipation , these two models have a common key ingredient , absent in conserving systems : there is an increase of the `` background energy '' at some ( or at all ) sites , occurring between avalanches ; _ ( i ) _ the accumulated stress at each site grows continuously between quakes in earthquake models as the ofc , and _",
    "( ii ) _ new trees grow between two consecutive fires in forest - fire models ( see below ) .    the effect of these `` * loading mechanisms * '' , as we shall call them generically , is to counterbalance the loss of `` energy '' ( grains , stress , trees ) produced by dissipation and , in this manner , try to restore conservation on average and , thus , criticality @xcite .",
    "however , let us caution that such a compensation needs to be exact and , therefore , unless a new mechanism giving rise to a perfect cancellation is devised , fine - tuning of the loading rate is the only obvious way in which conservation can be restored .",
    "let us now discuss in more detail these non - conserving archetypical models .",
    "the olami - feder - christensen cellular automaton @xcite is a simplified version of a previously proposed fault dynamics models : the spring - block of burridge - knopoff model @xcite and related _ stick - slip models _",
    "@xcite designed to capture the essence of earthquakes ( the gutenberg - richter law @xcite for the distribution of magnitudes ) as well as of similar systems with friction and jerky motion ( see appendix a ) .    at each time step , the `` forces '' @xmath13 ( or energies , to stick to our generic terminology ) , defined at each site of a two - dimensional lattice , are increased at a constant rate .",
    "whenever @xmath14 at any site reaches the threshold value , @xmath15 , it is reset to zero and the forces at its @xmath16 nearest neighbors are increased by an amount @xmath17 .",
    "this might trigger cascades of re - arrangements , i.e. avalanches .",
    "observe that the bulk dynamics is conserving only for @xmath18 in two - dimensions .",
    "early computer simulations and theoretical results @xcite seemed to support the existence of criticality for values of @xmath19 as low as @xmath20 .",
    "it was also early reported that , imposing periodic boundary conditions , the ofc model enters a cycle of periodic configurations with no sign of criticality whatsoever @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the bulk dynamics is profoundly influenced by boundary conditions .",
    "actually , it was proposed that boundary - induced heterogeneity is essential to obtain partial synchronization between clusters of different sizes and that such a partial _ synchronization or `` phase - locking '' mechanism _ is at the basis of the ofc complex behavior @xcite .",
    "the role of different features ( as , for instance , changes in the boundary conditions , introduction of quenched disorder in the local rules , lattice topology , etc . ) on synchronization and their effects in the properties of the ofc model have been largely analyzed in the literature @xcite .",
    "it has been also shown that results are affected by numerical precision @xcite .",
    "the overall picture is that the `` synchronization mechanism '' , even if fascinating , is too fragile as to be a solid explanation for generic emergence of criticality .",
    "a nice and rather exhaustive review of the literature on the ofc model and variations of it can be found in @xcite .    on the analytical side , brker and",
    "grassberger @xcite and chabanol and hakim @xcite , in two independent papers , were able to calculate the energy distribution , the effective branching ratio , and the average avalanche size for a _ random - neighbor _ version of the ofc model , which turns out to be analytically solvable .",
    "their main conclusion is that it is only in the conserving limit that the model becomes critical , while exponential cut - offs appear for any @xmath21 .",
    "similarly , de carvalho and prado claimed , relying on an effective branching ratio analysis @xcite , that the ofc model is only critical in the conserving limit ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , it is also shown in @xcite and @xcite that the average avalanche size is distributed as a power - law with a cut - off function , @xmath22 , which diverges in a very fast way when the conserving limit is approached .",
    "this provides an explanation for the relative large power - law regimes observed even in the non - conserving case",
    ". it would be certainly nice to have extensions of this result to other non - mean - field like systems .",
    "in a similar line of reasoning , kinouchi and prado introduced the concept of `` _ robust criticality _ '' or `` _ almost criticality _ '' @xcite : for a fixed dissipation rate , systems with a loading mechanism are closer to criticality than systems without it .",
    "the reason for this is simple : moderate loading partially compensates energy dissipation .    finally , the most recent and exhaustive analyses by miller and boulter @xcite , grassberger @xcite , and drossel and coauthors @xcite conclude unambiguously , using a variety of arguments and large - scale computer simulations , that _ the spatially extended version of the non - conserving ofc model is not critical_.    as a consequence , the state - of - the - art is that , despite of the apparent power law distributions spanning for a few decades , _ the ofc model is not truly scale - invariant , except for its conservative limit_. the question of whether real earthquakes are described or not by this type of soc models or other type of mechanisms need to be invoked remains unsolved @xcite .",
    "the drossel - schwabl model @xcite ( see also @xcite ) is an improved version of an older forest - fire model @xcite proposed to explain the apparent scale - invariance of real forest - fires @xcite ( see appendix a ) .",
    "three type of states are defined : @xmath23 or empty , @xmath24 or occupied by a tree , and @xmath25 or burning tree . at each time step ,",
    "new trees grow , at rate @xmath26 , at randomly chosen sites provided they were empty , and trees catch fire at a much smaller rate @xmath27 .",
    "fire propagates deterministically to neighboring occupied sites and , after burning , trees become empty sites .",
    "the relevant parameter is @xmath28 @xcite , and the model has been claimed to be critical provided that the double limit @xmath29 , @xmath30 with @xmath31 ) is taken @xcite .",
    "observe that _ a double separation of time scales _ is imposed in the model definition : trees are born at a much faster rhythm than fires occur and fires propagate at a much faster pace than trees grow @xcite .",
    "this is to be compared with the single time scale separation in sandpiles @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss later the consequences of such a double separation of timescales .",
    "analytical results and mappings into a branching process @xcite first suggested some similarities with standard percolation models @xcite . given the limited analytical tractability of these models , the controversy about the existence of true criticality was mainly played on the ground of computer simulations @xcite . for sufficiently large systems , anomalies were reported to appear ; among them : _ (",
    "i ) _ the repulsive character of the fixed point ( @xmath32 ) , _ ( ii ) _ the coexistence of largely - subcritical and supercritical clusters of trees , _ ( iii ) _ the existence of two length scales with different exponents into the system , _",
    "( iv ) _ the violation of standard scaling for the distribution of avalanche sizes @xmath33 , and _ ( v ) _ a pathological finite - size behavior @xcite .    finally , when `` massive '' simulations of extremely large systems very close to the critical regime were accessible @xcite , these anomalies turned into a lack of true critical behavior , beside of the apparent scaling observed for a few decades : _ the self - organized stationary state of the drossel - schwabl model is not critical_.    in the rest of the paper , we shall rationalize and generalize the above conclusion ( i.e. absence of _ bona - fide _ criticality of earthquake and forest - fire soc models ) to generic non - conserving systems . to this end",
    ", we shall employ three different unified frameworks , as described in the three forthcoming sections .",
    "as already mentioned , the random - neighbor version of the ofc model has been solved analytically , with the conclusion that , except for the conserving limit , it is not critical , but generically subcritical @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "in a subsequent work , pruessner and jensen @xcite considered a modified version of such a model in which , by including a different ( stronger ) loading mechanism , they showed that criticality can be restored in the infinite size limit . in this section ,",
    "we review the results in @xcite and study the finite - size scaling of this and related mean - field systems .",
    "the model in @xcite is somewhere in between forest - fire and earthquake models .",
    "it is defined as follows : consider a set of @xmath34 sites , each of them with an associated energy @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 a continuous variable ) .",
    "as in the ofc model , three types of states exist : _ stable _ , with an energy @xmath37 ; _ susceptible _ , with @xmath38 ; and _ active _ sites , with @xmath39 .",
    "the main difference with respect to the ofc model is that , between avalanches , driving and loading operate as independent mechanisms @xcite :    * _ background loading _ : in the spirit of forest - fire models @xcite , @xmath40 sites are randomly chosen and their respective energies are increased to @xmath41 ( i.e. become susceptible ) provided they were stable ; otherwise , nothing happens . * _ triggering of an avalanche _ : a randomly chosen site , @xmath42 , is activated ( @xmath43 ) provided it was susceptible .",
    "the relaxation dynamics within avalanches is identical to that of the random neighbor ofc model with @xmath44 random neighbors : sites above threshold are emptied , @xmath23 , and the energy of its ( randomly chosen ) neighbors is increased by a fixed amount @xmath19 .",
    "conservation holds for @xmath45 .    at a mean - field level",
    ", the condition for stationarity is given by the following energy - balance equation @xcite : @xmath46 where the different terms are as follows :    ( _ i _ ) l.h.s : for each relaxation event at site @xmath42 , the amount of dissipated energy is @xmath47 ; hence , the average dissipation during an avalanche is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the average avalanche size and @xmath50 the average energy of active sites .",
    "first term : triggering increases the energy of the selected susceptible site , @xmath42 , by an amount @xmath51 .",
    "the corresponding average increase is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the average energy of susceptible sites .",
    "( _ iii _ ) r.h.s .",
    ", second term : every time the background is loaded , the energy of a stable site , @xmath42 , is increased by an amount @xmath54 .",
    "this is attempted @xmath40 times and , the average number of triggering events before an avalanche is actually generated is @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the density of stable and susceptible sites , respectively ) .",
    "the average increase of background energy per avalanche is , finally , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 stands for the average energy of stable sites .    in this way ,",
    "eq.([balance ] ) establishes that , for a steady state to exist , the average dissipated energy should be compensated by the averaged energy increase of driving and loading .",
    "now , imposing in eq.([balance ] ) that @xmath40 diverges , one of the following two conditions must be obeyed for eq.([balance ] ) to hold @xcite :    1 .",
    "@xmath60 , i.e. there is strict conservation , or 2 .",
    "@xmath61 diverges , which is a necessary condition for criticality .    in the second case , by studying the probability distribution function of @xmath36 and using a mapping into a branching - process , it has been shown that not only @xmath61 diverges , but also that the system is _ critical in the infinite size limit _ @xcite . moreover , as expected for a mean - field model , the size - avalanche exponent is found to be @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "however , as already pointed out in @xcite , for any finite system size , @xmath34 , neither @xmath63 nor @xmath61 are infinite .",
    "in such a case , a finite value of the parameter @xmath63 _ must be fine - tuned _ to some precise value , @xmath64 , for eq.([balance ] ) to hold .",
    "such a value should diverge slower than @xmath34 , in order to achieve the right limit @xmath65 for @xmath66 , but there is no analytical prescription in @xcite on how to fix it for each system size .",

    ", we shall introduce a scaling langevin theory for non - conserving soc models , which explains in a straightforward way the two ( formerly unknown ) scaling laws , eq.([scaling ] ) and eq.([scaling2 ] ) .",
    "let us comment on the peculiarity of the thermodynamic limit in this model ( as well as in the drossel - schwabl forest - fire ) : the condition @xmath81 is automatically fulfilled by imposing the double separation of time - scale discussed above , _ i.e. _ the second separation of timescales is tantamount to fine - tuning @xmath82 to its critical value @xmath83 .",

    "furthermore , the width of fluctuations becomes smaller and smaller with increasing system size ( see left part of fig .",
    "[ panels ] ) , guaranteeing that in the thermodynamic limit the original sandpile self - organizes to criticality .",
    "this connection between `` driven / dissipative '' systems and their `` fixed - energy '' counterparts permits us to relate avalanche exponents to standard critical exponents ( see @xcite for scaling relations ) and to _ rationalize the critical properties of soc systems from the broader point of view of standard non - equilibrium ( absorbing - state ) phase transition _ @xcite .    using this approach",

    "the introduction of a non - vanishing dissipation rate affects in a relevant way the critical behavior of self - organizing systems _ ; depending on the initial condition , the dissipative eq.([dfes ] ) can be in the propagating / supercritical or in the non - propagating / subcritical phase of a dynamical percolation phase transition .",
    "now , we are in a good position to understand in depth the role of the loading mechanism in dissipative models of soc , within the langevin framework .",
    "to do so , let us complement eq.([dfes ] ) with a specific prescription on how to change the background energy field between avalanches , i.e. let us consider a loading rule , as for instance : @xmath196 ( where @xmath197 is a parameter and @xmath157 the average energy in the system ) and a driving rule : @xmath198 eq.([repob ] ) and eq.([seed ] ) define one possible loading mechanism for eq.([dfes ] ) ; other choices are , of course , possible ( for instance , the loading mechanism could also act `` during '' avalanches ) .",
    "the results presented in what follows are generic , essentially independent of such a choice .    as shown above , eq.([dfes ] ) can sustain avalanches propagating indefinitely ( up to system size ) , provided that the initial energy is large enough . therefore ,",
    "considering large values of @xmath199 or of @xmath197 in eq.([repob ] ) ) , the system becomes supercritical for avalanche propagation .",
    "instead , small initial densities lead to subcritical propagation .    to illustrate this and the forthcoming discussion , we have performed computer simulations of eq.([dfes ] ) using the parameter values specified in the caption of fig .",
    "[ panels ] , and complemented with the loading and driving rules eq.([repob ] ) and eq.([seed ] ) . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we have considered @xmath34 sites with an _ all - to - all _ ( mean - field ) coupling . to check the robustness of our conclusions",

    "this shifting generates a _ broad distribution of energy values for any system size_. after the avalanche stops , the system is `` loaded '' again ( eq.([repob ] ) ) , a new avalanche is triggered ( eq.([seed ] ) ) , and so on . in this way , the system is kept hovering around the critical point , with a broad distribution of values , as illustrated in fig .

    "[ histograms ] , ( right panel ) histograms for @xmath204 and various values of @xmath12 are plot ; in all cases , there is a double - peak structure .",
    "observe that , for large dissipation rates , the system gets deeper into the absorbing phase .",
    "it is important to remark , that ( as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ panels ] ) the dynamics is rather different from its conserving counterpart : while , in the conserving case , fluctuations around @xmath158 decrease in amplitude with system - size ( fig .",
    "[ panels ] , left - panels ) , in the non - conserving case the histograms remain broad , even in the thermodynamical limit ( see fig .  [ panels ] , right panels ) ; i.e. large variations around the critical spreading point persist for any system size .",
    "we caution the reader that , within an avalanche , the process is _ not stationary _ ( energy decreases ) and , therefore , the histograms shown in fig .  [ panels ] and fig .  [ histograms ] can not be properly interpreted as probability distribution functions .    for this reason ,",
    "we have also constructed _ stationary _ ( steady state ) histograms for _",

    "any of these can be used , as well , to illustrate the differences with the conserving case .",

    ", one can make the educated guess that the associated avalanche size distribution ( or any other quantity measured for avalanches / spreading ) , with such a distribution of initial conditions , will be a convolution of different subcritical and supercritical curves weighted with the above distribution of initial energies .",
    ", for avalanche propagation for various system sizes in numerical simulations of eq.([dfes ] ) endowed with the loading mechanism eq.([repob ] ) ( parameter values are as in fig.[panels ] ) .",
    "observe that the distribution remains broad in the thermodynamic limit.,height=226 ]    let us emphasize the lack of any mechanism tuning the system to criticality : the energy is initially set to some arbitrary value ( controlled by the parameter @xmath199 ) . if and only if the initial density is _ fine tuned _ to the critical value for spreading of activity , @xmath195 , the system is at the critical point for avalanche spreading .",
    "otherwise , for larger values of @xmath199 the system is initially supercritical , while for smaller values it is sub - critical .    in conclusion , fine - tuning of the loading mechanism",
    "is required to have critical spreading in non - conserving systems , and it is controlled by a dynamical percolation critical point . the important point to stress is that , _ even if the initial condition is not critical for generic values of @xmath199 and @xmath197 , the `` hovering - around - the - critical - point '' mechanism _ , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ panels ] ( right panels ) , _ keeps the dynamics effectively not far from criticality , but not at criticality , for a broad range of parameter values_. furthermore , contrarily to the conserving case ( fig .",
    "[ panels ] , left panels ) , the energy histograms do not tend to a delta - peak function for large system sizes .",
    "large excursions into both the supercritical and the subcritical phases persist in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "using this insight , we can now tackle the open question : how does @xmath64 scales at criticality in the model discussed in section [ zeroth ] ?",
    "as @xmath64 is a background energy , it corresponds to a mass term in the langevin equation for the activity , eq.([newterms ] ) .",
    "therefore , to preserve scale - invariance , it needs to be scaled with @xmath34 as a distance to the critical point and , therefore : @xmath207 where @xmath11 is the correlation length and @xmath208 the correlation length exponent , whose mean - field value in the dynamical percolation class is @xmath209 @xcite .    at the upper critical dimension , @xmath193 ( where hyper - scaling mean - field relations are expected to hold ) ,",
    "@xmath11 is limited by the system linear size , @xmath210 , where @xmath34 is the volume ( i.e. total number of sites ) : @xmath211 putting together these two last equations , we obtain the mean - field scaling result , @xmath212 this is in excellent agreement with the empirical result reported in eq.([scaling ] ) .",
    "analogously , the cut - off of the avalanche size distribution , @xmath213 , needs to scale as @xmath214 where we have used the fractal dimension , @xmath215 , for mean - field dynamical percolation @xcite .",
    "again , this prediction is in perfect agreement with the numerical results eq.([scaling2 ] ) .    in conclusion , the loading parameter needs to be fine - tuned for each finite size to have true scale - invariance ; its scaling is inherited from a dynamical percolation critical point .",
    "the numerical results reported in this section correspond , as already stressed , to an all - to - all ( as well as random - neighbors ) coupling in eq.([dfes ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "qualitatively similar results can be obtained for spatially extended systems : i.e. a broad distribution of the spatially - averaged energy , hovering around the critical point .",
    "the main difference is that , obviously , the background energy becomes heterogeneously distributed in space and , therefore , the situation becomes much more involved .",
    "eq.([dfes ] ) generates spontaneously regions with higher and with lower values of @xmath157 , which have different propensities to activity propagation : there are _ locally _ super - critical and sub - critical regions .",
    "patches where avalanches have passed are typically less likely to propagate new activity owing to the non - markovian term in eq.([dfes ] ) .",
    "the size distribution of such patches is , accordingly , inherited from the avalanche size distribution , creating a complex landscape for further avalanche propagation .",
    "this scenario is , of course , more complex than in the mean - field one discussed above , but the essence of the described phenomenology remains un - altered : the ( local ) control parameter hovers - around a dynamical percolation critical point , with fluctuations that do not vanish in the large system - size limit .",
    "observe that , in order to tune the system to criticality ( as done in the mean - field case ) one would need in this case to define a more complicated loading mechanism which should get rid of the dynamically generated heterogeneities , leading to a homogeneous initial - energy state , tuned exactly to its critical value . using the language of @xcite , one needs to `` hire a babysitter '' ( or a `` gardener '' using the forest - fire terminology @xcite ) to keep the spatially extended system sitting ( everywhere ) at criticality .",
    "once such an efficient babysitter is at work , the initial condition is always at the ( dynamical percolation ) critical point in any dimension .",
    "from this perspective , our theory provides additional support for the claim in @xcite that the critical density of trees in a forest fire model should coincide with the percolation critical density , i.e. in order to observe critical propagation in the forest - fire model one should tune the initial background ( number of trees ) to the corresponding dynamical percolation critical density .",
    "as already pointed out by grassberger some time ago @xcite , in the absence of an efficient gardener taking care of local fine - tuning , partial power - laws are still observed in the _ forest - fire model_. this is due to the existence of patches with different densities of trees , which appear with a broad spectrum of sizes .",
    "each of such patches lies at a different distance of the critical point .",
    "the convolution of avalanches propagating in such a variety of initial conditions originates a complex _ pseudo - scaling picture _ which , obviously , does not correspond to strict criticality .",
    "a similar picture applies also to the ( open - boundaries ) ofc earthquake model @xcite , and to self - organized models of neural activity ( as will be illustrated in a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "summing up : in this section , we have reviewed the standard absorbing state phase transition picture of soc , underlining the special role played by conservation .",
    "then , we have introduced a bulk dissipation term and illustrated that the active phase disappears and the universality class of the involved spreading phase transition is changed from _",
    "c - dp _ to _ dynamical percolation_. dissipation needs to be compensated by a loading mechanism ( which controls the initial conditions in which avalanches are started ) to keep the energy balance . if and only if the loading mechanism is perfectly fine - tuned to generate a precise initial energy density , true criticality is observed .",
    "otherwise , the system just hovers around a dynamical percolation critical point , with large excursions into the propagating and the absorbing phases .",
    "contrarily to the conserving case , such fluctuations do not disappear in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "_ strictly speaking _ ,",
    "this mechanism of self - organization can not be called critical , we propose to refer to it as _ self - organized quasi - criticality _ ( soqc ) .",
    "last but not least , our approach provides a way to rationalize the finite size scaling properties of non - conserving self - organized systems , as earthquake or forest - fire models , and has allowed us to derive a number of previously unknown scaling relations .",
    "we have shown , by using different levels of description , that non - conserving models of self - organized criticality , as earthquake and fire - forest models , are not truly critical .    _ first _ , we have studied a simple mean - field theory , based on an energy balance equation , for a non - conserving model introduced by pruessner and jensen .",
    "it permits us to illustrate that , even if one can construct non - conserving models that seem critical in the thermodynamic limit , there is no systematic way to have a coherent finite - size scaling description of them : a precise _ fine tuning is required _ for any finite size to observe criticality and to approach the thermodynamic limit in a scale - invariant way .",
    "_ second _ , we have revisited the mapping of high - dimensional ( mean - field ) avalanching systems into a self - organized branching process , introduced by zapperi _",
    "some years ago .",
    "the underlying idea is that in high dimensions avalanches do not visit twice a given site and they can be described as a branching process , whose branching probability depends on the energy background .",
    "this allows us to write an evolution equation for the branching probability for models with slow driving and dissipation .",
    "while in the conserving case the branching probability converges to its critical value , in the presence of bulk - dissipation the convergence is towards a _ subcritical _ point . introducing a loading mechanism ( which mimics the growth of new trees in forest fire automata or the continuous building - up of stress in earthquake models )",
    ", we have shown that _ the fixed - point towards which the system self - organizes can be either critical , subcritical , or supercritical_. contrarily to previous claims , a fine - tuning of the loading mechanism is required to reach criticality within this approach .",
    "_ third _ , we have introduced a full stochastic description of soc systems in terms of langevin equations .",
    "we have reviewed how conserving systems self - organize to a critical point with well known critical exponents ( in the conserved - directed - percolation universality class ) . instead , for dissipative systems with a loading term , the dynamics is found to _",
    "hover around _ a critical point , with large excursions into the absorbing and the propagating phases , which do not disappear in the large system size limit",
    ". therefore , such systems are not generically critical .",
    "still , some traits of the underlying dynamical percolation critical point can be observed , depending on the loading parameter and system - size , i.e depending on how large the excursions into the absorbing / propagating phase are .",
    "all these three approaches provide overwhelming evidence that conserving - dynamics is a necessary condition to observe self - organization to criticality .",
    "instead , in non - conserving ( dissipative ) systems equipped with a loading mechanism , a fine tuning of a loading parameter is required to have the system sitting at a critical point .",
    "otherwise , the system just _ hovers around _ a critical point , with broadly distributed fluctuations which do not dissappear in the thermodynamic limit : for a broad range of parameters , non - conserving systems can be fluctuating in the vicinity of a critical point , but not _ at _ the critical point .",
    "we propose to call this : _ self - organized quasi - criticality _ ..",
    "this conclusion extends to some other non - conserving models of soc as those for synchronization of integrate - and - fire oscillators described in @xcite , the model in @xcite , or the model of neural avalanches in @xcite ( as will be explained in a separate publication ) .",
    "+ _ is it sensible to refer to self - organized dissipative systems as `` critical '' ? _",
    "the answer to this question is mostly a matter of taste , and depends on what one wants to define as criticality .",
    "being strict and calling critical only to systems sitting at a critical point ( allowing at most for fluctuations that vanish in the thermodynamic limit ) , then _ non - conserving systems are not truly critical models_.    being more permissive , one could accept , in principle , the term `` critical '' to refer to systems hovering around a critical point ( with persistent excursions into the subcritical and supercritical regimes ) , which exhibit `` dirty scaling '' .    in order to avoid miss - understandings and miss - conceptions , we strongly favor the use of an alternative terminology like `` almost criticality '' @xcite , `` pseudo - criticality '' , or , as we said , * self - organized quasi - criticality * ( soqc ) to refer to non - conserving self - organized systems , and suggest to restrict the term `` critical '' for truly scale - invariant systems .",
    "actually , in many cases , strict criticality might not be required to explain empirical ( truncated ) power - laws distributions observed in the real world and , therefore , `` self - organized quasi - criticality '' remains a useful concept , despite of the somehow inappropriate and certainly confusing use ( and abuse ) of the word `` critical '' in the literature . under this light",
    ", one could reconsider the empirical observations discussed in the introduction , as well as similar ones for which power law distributions have been reported .",
    "a critical inspection of them reveals in many cases that empirical data are better described by truncated power - laws rather than by pure power - laws @xcite .",
    "for the sake of completeness , in this appendix we present some of the basic toy models of self - organized criticality .",
    "all of them are defined in a @xmath91-dimensional lattice ( generalizations to @xmath216-dimensions , to random - neighbor or all - to - all couplings are straightforward ) .      consider a ( height or `` energy '' ) variable @xmath217 , which takes integer ( non - negative ) values at each site @xmath218 of a two - dimensional lattice . the ingredients of sandpiles , ricepiles , and related models can be sketched as :    * _ slow driving _ : a small input of energy is externally introduced into the system ( grains are dropped ) , usually at a single site : @xmath219 . * _ activation _ : a site receiving energy , stores it until a given * threshold * , @xmath220 , is exceeded and the site is declared _ active _ ; otherwise nothing happens and the system is driven again . * _ relaxation ( or `` toppling '' ) _ : each active site redistributes ( all or a fraction of ) its accumulated energy among its neighbors .",
    "a relaxation event can trigger a chain reaction or _",
    "avalanche _ by activating its neighbors and so forth . * _ boundary dissipation _ : when redistribution events reach the ( open ) boundaries of the system , energy is dropped off . *",
    "_ iteration _ : when activity has ceased , the avalanche stops , and a new external input is added .",
    "the driving / dissipation cycle is iterated until a statistically stationary state is reached .    for each specific model , the relaxation rules and some other details can change , giving rise to a zoo of models .",
    "we enumerate some of the more commonly studied ones :    * the deterministic bak - tang - wiesenfeld sandpile model : * the threshold is fixed to @xmath221 ( @xmath222 in @xmath216-dimensions ) .",
    "active sites relax according to :    @xmath223    that is , an active site is emptied and its grains are _ deterministically _ redistributed amongst its nearest neighbors .",
    "the energy at sites out of the system is fixed to @xmath23 , enforcing boundary dissipation when boundary sites topple .",
    "avalanches measured in such a steady state were originally claimed to be critical @xcite .",
    "later work showed that actually , owing to the _ deterministic _ nature of the model and , as a consequence , to the existence of many toppling invariants and breakdown of ergodicity @xcite the system is not truly critical but exhibits anomalous multi - scaling @xcite .",
    "other authors ( see , for instance , @xcite ) suggested that avalanches do not obey any type of scaling whatsoever . to avoid the pathologies associated with deterministic rules , we focus all along this paper on _ stochastic _ models .    * the stochastic manna model : * the dynamics of the manna model is similar to the deterministic btw , but the threshold is fixed to @xmath224 in any dimension and stochasticity is introduced in the redistribution rule @xcite : @xmath225 this is the `` inclusive '' version of the model . in its `` exclusive '' version ,",
    "the two grains are forced to go to different neighbors . both of these versions self - organize the model to a critical point in the c - dp ( or `` manna '' ) class in any dimension @xcite .",
    "* the stochastic oslo model : * this ( ricepile ) model has annealed random thresholds at each site : every time a site topples , a new threshold @xmath226 is randomly chosen with equal probabilities @xcite . redistribution of energy units ( grains ) is done as in the manna model , in a stochastic fashion .",
    "these rules lead to self - organization to a critical point in the c - dp universality class with rather clean scaling @xcite .      a continuous `` force '' or `` energy '' @xmath13 , randomly distributed between @xmath227 and a threshold value , @xmath228 , is initially assigned to each site @xmath218 of a two - dimensional lattice . during the driving step , the site with maximum force , @xmath229 , is identified , and the force of all sites is increased by @xmath230 , creating ( at least ) one seed of activity ( this is equivalent to advancing all sites at a fixed constant velocity until one of them , the maximum , reaches the threshold ) .",
    "contrarily to sandpile models , this driving affects all sites .",
    "an active site relaxes according to : @xmath231 where @xmath232 is a _ bulk - dissipation parameter_. the model is conserving only for @xmath18 .",
    "the force at sites out of the system is fixed to @xmath233 , entailing boundary dissipation .",
    "the stationary state of such a system was claimed to be critical for a broad range of values of @xmath19 @xcite , but recent analyses disprove such a claim ( see for instance @xcite and section [ intro ] ) .",
