    "in the usual three step model of high harmonic generation , hhg is treated as a purely electronic process . a single active electron tunnels free of a parent molecule and eventually scatters from it , but the molecule itself is treated in essentially the same way as a lone atom ; no more than a complicated potential influencing the active electron .",
    "however , molecules differ from atoms in an essential way because they possess non electronic internal degrees of freedom , which can themselves be affected by the high harmonic process .",
    "the possibility that such internal degrees of freedom could play a detectable role in hhg is intriguing , because the intrinsic timescale in hhg  the time necessary to ionize , propagate and rescatter  is only half a laser cycle .",
    "this is faster than many chemically interesting processes , holding out the possibility that hhg could serve as a probe of molecular motion . alternatively , tailoring the state of a molecule prior to hhg could serve to give additional control over the generated light .",
    "these issues were brought to the fore by an experiment at jila @xcite . in the experiment ,",
    "a high harmonic generating laser pulse was preceded by a weaker pulse whose effect was to stimulate raman - active vibrations in sf@xmath0 molecules . varying the delay between the two pulses was observed to modulate the intensity of the hhg light generated by the second pulse .",
    "moreover , the modulation corresponds to the frequencies of the raman - active normal modes stimulated by the first pulse .",
    "none of the 3 non - raman - active vibrational modes of sf@xmath0 were detected in the modulated signal .",
    "this paper presents a quantum mechanical model of high harmonic generation in molecules .",
    "this model provides a framework to interpret the observed modulation of high harmonic intensities observed in the jila experiment , and is easily extended to systems with more complicated dynamics .",
    "secondly , it presents a version of the three step model which has been improved for the purpose of treating hhg in molecules with relevant internal degrees of freedom .",
    "finally , the modulations predicted by this improved model are compared with the modulations observed in the jila experiment .",
    "this paper recapitulates and extends work which originally appeared in @xcite .",
    "an important difference between atomic and molecular systems , probed by the aforementioned experiment@xcite is the presence of vibrational degrees of freedom in the latter . for an @xmath1-atom molecule",

    "the vibrational wavefunction of the molecule can then be expanded as the product of simple harmonic oscillator basis functions in each of the normal modes of the molecule : @xmath4 where @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the outer product of simple harmonic oscillator state @xmath7 in the first normal mode , @xmath8 in the second normal mode , and so on .    for the purposes of this paper ,",

    "although high harmonic generation is primarily an electronic process , the vibrational state of the molecule can affect the harmonic intensity .",
    "this occurs because at several points in the high harmonic process , the vibrational wavefunction has amplitudes either to stay unchanged or to `` hop '' up or down from simple harmonic oscillator state @xmath17 to states @xmath18 , much in the same way that a photon in a beamsplitter has amplitudes to take two or more paths . as in a beamsplitter experiment , two or more indistinguishable pathways interfere with one another and modulate the output signal detectably .",
    "the multiple pathways at play in the high harmonic process are diagrammed in figure [ fig : crossings ] .     and @xmath19 vibrational states .",
    "after a time delay , the two vibrational states are mixed by stimulated raman scattering ( transfer matrix ) , `` hopping '' during ionization ( ) and recombination ( ) , as well as evolution of the ionic wavefunction while the electron is away ( ) .",

    "the resulting vibrational state populations and modulations of the different components of the hhg signal show a rich angular structure which is lost upon angular averaging .",
    "note that all calculations presented here have used the separable approximation of eq.[eq : separability ] for the amplitudes of the different vibrational modes .",
    "this is expected to be accurate to the extent that the ground vibrational state dominates , meaning that for the amplitudes that we have calculated here , the higher - order nonseparable pathways are at least beginning to become important , which diminishes the validity of this approximation .",
    "nevertheless , it is still expected to have at least qualitative and perhaps even semi - quantitative validity for the range of parameters studied here .    using the separable approximation ,",
    "the final populations of the @xmath20 and @xmath37 for each normal mode and their modulation as a function of time were calculated as a function of angle using equation [ eq : intensity ] .",
    "figures [ fig : t2gpopfrac],[fig : t2g0popmod],[fig : t2g1popmod ] show final state populations and the real and imaginary components of the modulation as a function of angle for the @xmath164 mode transforming like @xmath70 .",
    "figures [ fig : egpopfrac],[fig : eg0popmod],[fig : eg1popmod ] show final state populations and modulations for the @xmath82 mode transforming like @xmath165 , while figures [ fig : a1gpopfrac],[fig : a1g0popmod],[fig : a1g1popmod ] show final populations and modulation fractions for the totally symmetric @xmath166 mode . in all three modes ,",
    "the population of the @xmath37 vibrational state is modulated much more heavily than the population of the @xmath20 state .",
    "a noteworthy feature of these figures is that in regions where raman excitation during the hhg pulse is weak , the modulation of the hhg signal due to @xmath169 ( ie , hhg processes ending with the molecule in the ground vibrational state ) tends to cancel modulation due to @xmath170 ( leaving the molecule in the first vibrational state ) .",
    "for this reason , angle - averaged modulations of the overall hhg signal due to the t@xmath56 and e@xmath55 normal modes give almost zero overall modulation , while the modulations of the @xmath169 or @xmath170 give a large fractional modulation .",
    "( the a@xmath51 mode experiences strong raman excitation at all molecular orientations , and experiences less cancellation as a result . )",
    "it is not clear why this cancellation is not observed in the experiment , where the t@xmath56 mode is typically the most visible @xcite .",
    "this could arise due to a variety of causes , such as preferential detection of the @xmath170 component of the signal relative to the @xmath169 component , or some mechanism changing the phase between the modulation of the two components and thereby eliminate the cancellation .",
    "table [ table:01popfrac ] shows the fraction of molecules finishing the hhg process in the @xmath20 and @xmath37 states , while table [ table:01popmod ] compares the modulation of the @xmath169 and @xmath170 components of the signal , the modulation of the total signal , and the two experimental runs which were able to detect modulations at all three vibrational frequencies .",
    "tables [ table : manystatepopfrac ] and [ table : manystatepopmod ] shows the same information when the hhg process is allowed to populate vibrational states up to @xmath171 it is apparent from table [ table : manystatepopfrac ] that including higher vibrational states of the t@xmath56 and e@xmath55 modes do not greatly affect the calculated modulations . for the @xmath166 mode , which undergoes stronger raman excitation , the presence of @xmath22 and higher vibrational states does become important .",
    ".peak - to - peak modulation , theory vs. experiment ( 2 state model ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : manystatepopfrac ]    although the agreement with experiment is not perfect , it is nevertheless significant that the simple model of vibrational interference presented here agrees with experiment to the correct order of magnitude .",
    "this is particularly notable in light of conventional raman spectroscopy , in which the a@xmath51 peak is 20 times more prominent than the others .",
    "it is difficult to precisely gauge the agreement of theory and experiment , due to the paucity of experimental data .",
    "peak - to - peak modulations vary extensively from one experimental run to another @xcite with this sf@xmath0 experiment .",
    "the modulation at 525 @xmath172 , corresponding to the t@xmath56 mode , appears most prominently in the experimental data , yet it gives the smallest modulation in this treatment .",
    "the prominence of the t@xmath56 mode modulation may suggest that the off - diagonal jahn - teller coupling @xmath73 is larger than obtained in the present calculations .",
    "alternatively , it may be necessary to model the experiment in more detail ",
    "i.e. to incorporate the spatially - varying laser intensity , the uncontrolled carrier envelope phase , the combination of multiple laser half cycles , etc  beyond that which has been included in the present theoretical description .",
    "the problem of high harmonic generation in molecules can be conceptually separated into two parts : the evolution of the continuum electron , and the evolution of the internal ( vibrational ) wavefunction of the parent ion .",
    "this paper describes the evolution of the continuum electron in a model which combines a semiclassical treatment of the propagation with a fully quantum mechanical description of the electron - molecule scattering .",
    "this flexible and robust model has a simple conceptual link to existing semiclassical models , yet it allows for a sophisticated treatment of the complicated electron - molecule scattering .",
    "the internal dynamics of the parent ion are tracked throughout the high harmonic process .",
    "together , these two innovations serve to give an unprecedented view of high harmonic generation in a comparatively large , complicated molecule with many internal degrees of freedom , giving results which agree with experiment to within an order of magnitude .",
    "the possibility that high harmonic generation may serve as an ultrafast interferometric probe of a molecular vibrational wavefunction is extremely promising . such a wavefunction need not be prepared by an initial raman pulse , as was the case for the jila experiment . instead , a preparatory pulse could photoionize a molecule , excite it to a higher electronic state , or trigger the beginning of some other chemical process . in this way , vibrational wavepacket evolution during chemical processes",
    "could be observed as it happens .",

    "in this approximate treatment , the wavefunction in the forbidden region is found using the wkb connection formulas .",
