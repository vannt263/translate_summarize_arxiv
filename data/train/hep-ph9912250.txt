    "bose - einstein correlations are of interest to the lep community as a source of systematic error in w - mass determinations ( for example @xcite ) , and also to the heavy ion community ( see @xcite ) as a valuable measurement tool for the size of the fireball created in heavy ion collisions ( eg . @xcite and refs therein ) .    due to limited statistics , measurements of",
    "be enhancement at lep are often made in terms of a single variable @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the 4-momenta of a pair of out going bosons .",
    "the enhancement is described by a correlation function which introduces an extra parameter , the hbt ( hanbury - brown - twiss @xcite ) radius .",
    "it has been observed @xcite that the radii measured depend on the mass of the boson being used . in general the lighter bosons",
    "tend to give larger radii . in this section",
    "i describe the construction of the correlation function as a function of @xmath5 and its relation to the single particle wigner distribution . in section 2",
    "i use a simple gaussian model for the wigner density , and discuss the correlation function in various limits . in section",
    "3 numerical results are presented for particles of various different masses and sources of different sizes .",
    "i conclude with a discussion of how far these results can go to explain the observed mass dependence of experimental bose - einstein parameters .",
    "the _ correlation function _ can be defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the density of particle pairs with invariant momentum separation @xmath5 , and @xmath8 is the same density measured with respect to a reference distribution .",
    "the densities @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be defined in terms of the single- and two - particle momentum densities ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively ) according to @xmath13 @xmath14 where the function @xmath15 is just @xmath16 .",
    "the single - particle momentum distribution is given in terms of the one - particle wigner distribution @xmath17 , @xmath18 it has long been known that under rather general assumptions the two - particle distribution can also be related to the one - particle wigner density @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "it is thus possible , given the source distribution , to compute the densities @xmath11 and @xmath12 and hence @xmath9 and @xmath10 , then to construct explicitly the correlation function @xmath22 .",
    "the correlation function @xmath22 may depend on the particle masses through the integration limits in equations ( 1.2 ) and ( 1.3 ) , even when there is no explicit mass dependence in the source function @xmath23 . in the next section",
    "i examine this implicit dependence for a gaussian source .",
    "to illustrate the kinematical mass effects it is best to take a simple model . consider an instantaneous , uncorrelated source , gaussian in both space and momentum .",
    "the normalised source distribution is given by @xmath24 the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the typical size of the source in position and momentum space , respectively .",
    "the single and two particle distributions can now be obtained using the formulae of the previous section : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "note that in this simple example the fully differential particle distributions do * not * depend on the particle masses .",
    "inserting eqs .",
    "( [ single],[double ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ rho1],[rho2 ] ) and then constructing eq .",
    "( [ corrq ] ) gives the expression for the correlation function @xmath30 due to the spherical symmetry of the source most of the angular integrations are trivial .",
    "the @xmath31-function constraint can be satisfied with the angle between @xmath32 and @xmath33 ; define the cosine of this angle to be @xmath34 .",
    "the integrations may then be re - written , @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "constants independent of @xmath3 and @xmath4 have been dropped as these cancel in the ratio ( [ correqn ] ) .",
    "the variable @xmath34 as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath4 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the heaviside ( theta ) function .",
    "notice that mass dependence has now crept into @xmath22 via the integration limits .",
    "the theta - functions in eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) give rise to a complicated integration region in the @xmath39 plane which depends on the mass of the bosons .",
    "the integration region can be summarized as @xmath40 @xmath41 this takes on simple forms in the following limits @xmath42    now the be enhanced region of the @xmath39 plane lies on a band of thickness @xmath43 centered around @xmath44 , while the reference density lies largely in the region @xmath45 .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the enhanced region and the integration bounds for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "it is then clear that for any @xmath48 the enhanced region occupies a fraction @xmath49^{-1})$ ] of the populated region .",
    "this factor must always be less than one by the uncertainty principle and so the strength of the correlation is reduced .",
    "in fact it is possible to show that in the massless limit , the intercept of the correlation function at @xmath50 occurs at @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "the opposite limit @xmath53 is qualitatively different .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ limit2 ] ) that as @xmath54 with @xmath53 , the integration region is squeezed into a narrow wedge along the diagonal of the @xmath39 plane ( the integration region in figure 1 is approaching this limit ) .",
    "if the inequality @xmath55 is satisfied then the integration region only contains the enhanced region and the correlation function can approach the expected value of @xmath56 .",
    "in fact in the limit that the mass is large compared to all other scales , the correlation function approaches the ` naive ' form @xmath57 where @xmath58",
    "in the case of an arbitrary mass the integrations must be done numerically .",
    "the correlation function shows different behaviour depending on the values of the mass and source parameters .",
    "the results of numerical evaluation of eqn.([correqn ] ) are illustrated in figures ( 3,4 ) .",
    "the typical momentum is set to the value @xmath59 in order to be comparable with the observed pion spectrum at the z peak .",
    "this implies @xmath60 fm which is consistent with all current estimates of the source size from be correlations .",
    "figure 3 shows the computed correlation function for a source of size @xmath61 fm , and for three values of the mass roughly corresponding to the pion , kaon and @xmath62 baryon spin state for ease of comparision .",
    "the @xmath62 is , of course , a fermion and after spin averaging displays anticorrelations , which lead to a suppression at small relative @xmath5 .",
    "this does not affect discussion of the hbt radius ] masses .",
    "this corresponds to near the limit of the uncertainty principle ( @xmath63 ) . as implied in eq([corrsuppress ] ) the correlation is more strongly suppressed in the region @xmath47 if @xmath64 is large .",
    "this is , in fact , quite general and the opposite is true ; when @xmath64 is close to the uncertainty limit the correlation function is only weakly suppressed .",
    "this is because when @xmath65 , the enhanced region extends over _ all _ the populated phase space ( see discussion and figures from previous section ) and averaging over the phase space causes no dilution .",
    "the opposite limit ( @xmath64 large ) is explored in figure 4 . here",
    "the source radius is @xmath66 fm which takes @xmath64 sufficiently far from the heisenberg limit to give strong suppression .",
    "the effect is particularly noticeable for the pion correlation which becomes suppressed by a roughly a factor of @xmath67 in the region @xmath47 .",
    "this leads to typically non - gaussian shapes for the pion ( and other low mass ) correlation functions .",
    "the suppression differentiates between the kaon and @xmath62 correlations leading to a hierarchy of effective radii , @xmath68 .    from figures ( 3,4 )",
    "one can see that smaller masses give characteristically sharper correlation functions as compared to heavier bosons .",
    "one can define an effective radius for the source ( somewhat arbitrarily ) in terms of the width at @xmath69 of the maximum of the correlation function .",
    "this results in the estimates shown in table 1 ( see @xcite and @xcite for pion and kaon measurements respectively ) .",
    "the reader may wonder if perhaps some intermediate source radius would provide a fit to the experimental radii .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "if one insists on fitting the source size measured by @xmath62 correlations one is forced to a source of no larger than @xmath70 fm .",
    "the constraint that @xmath71 gev now leaves @xmath72 too small to provide the suppression necessary to fit the kaon and pion hbt radii . on the other hand ,",
    "a source with @xmath73 leads to natural radii for pion and kaon correlations of order @xmath74 and @xmath75 which are larger than experimentally observed .",
    "an intermediate choice for @xmath25 leads to distorted correlation functions which are partially suppressed for @xmath76 .",
    "these are difficult to parameterise in terms of a single radius .",
    "it is interesting to note that the correlation function for @xmath77 and @xmath78 can be rather well approximated by the expression : @xmath79 where @xmath80 the suppression term multiplying the gaussian tends to unity as @xmath81 , and approaches the value @xmath82 as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 as given in eqn.([corrsuppress ] ) .",
    "i have shown that the averaging over phase - space to produce a correlation function of a single variable ( q ) induces non - trivial , mass dependent distortions on the correlation function .",
    "it has been demonstrated that these distortions are such that correlations between smaller mass bosons are inherently shorter range in q and lead to larger apparent radii .",
    "the effect is greatest away from the heisenberg limit .    for the physically reasonable value of @xmath85 gev ,",
    "it is not possible to find a source radius @xmath25 such that the kinematic averaging simultaneously fits the experimentally measured hbt radii in pion , kaon and @xmath62 baryon correlations .",
    "as can be seen from table 1 , away from @xmath86 , averaging over phase - space can induce a mass dependence of the hbt radii of the same order of magnitude as experimentally observed ( but not with the same absolute values ) .",
