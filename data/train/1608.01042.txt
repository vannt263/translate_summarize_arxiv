    "w uma type binaries are cool short - period ( usually less than 1 day ) binary systems with both components filling their critical roche lobes and sharing a common convective envelope during their main sequence ( ms ) evolutionary stage .",
    "the more massive primary component is a main sequence star whereas the secondary is oversized compared to its expected ms radius .",
    "the formation and evolution of w uma type binary systems are still unsolved problems in astrophysics .",
    "the most popular evolutionary scenario is that they are formed from initially detached systems via angular momentum loss ( aml ) by means of magnetic stellar wind .",
    "model calculations suggest that these binary stars will ultimately coalesce into single stars which may be progenitors of the poorly understood blue stragglers and fk com - type stars @xcite .    ii uma ( bd+55 1540 , hip 61237 , @xmath1 = @xmath13 ) is a component of the visual binary ads 8954 , with the separation of @xmath14 and difference in brightness of 1.64 mag .",
    "the photometric variability of the star was discovered by the @xmath15 satellite ( esa , 1997 ) .",
    "radial velocity curves of both components in ii uma were obtained by @xcite and gave the results : @xmath16 , @xmath17 km s@xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "they pointed out that ii uma was a a - subtype w uma binary system with a spectral type of f5iii .",
    "later , detailed investigation by @xcite determined that it was a triple system with a solar - type close - in tertiary component .",
    "the temperature of the tertiary component is about @xmath20 and the mass ratio is @xmath8",
    ". the first photometric solutions of ii uma were published by @xcite .",
    "then , @xcite also obtained the photometric parameters of this binary system . in the present paper , four - color light curves ( lcs ) of ii uma",
    "are analyzed and its formation and evolutionary scenario are discussed .",
    "the period variations of the binary system is investigated for the first time , which may reveal the dynamics interaction between the two components .",
    "the four - color ( @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 ) light curves of ii uma were carried out in five continuous nights on february 1 , february 2 , february 3 , february 4 and february 5 , 2012 with an andor dv436 2k ccd camera attached to the 60 cm reflecting telescope at yunnan observatories ( ynos ) .",
    "the coordinates of the variable star , the comparison star and the check star were listed in table [ coordinates2 ] .",
    "the integration time were 60s for @xmath0 band , 30s for @xmath1 band , 15s for @xmath2 band , and 10s for @xmath3 band , respectively .",
    "the light curves of those observations were displayed in fig .",
    "1 . during the observations ,",
    "the broadband johnson - cousins @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 filters were used .",
    "phot ( measured magnitudes for a list of stars ) of the aperture photometry package in the iraf was used to reduce the observed images .",

    "the errors listed in table 4 are internal errors resulting from the application of the wd code to the supplied data .     and @xmath3 bands for ii uma .",
    "the standard deviation of the fitting residuals are 0.011 mag for @xmath0 band , 0.011 mag for @xmath1 band , 0.010 mag for @xmath2 band and 0.010 mag for @xmath3 band , respectively .",
    "the dash lines represent theoretical light curves without the third light.,width=529 ]        it has to be mentioned that the errors listed in table 4 are internal errors resulting from the application of the wd code to the supplied data .",
    "the effective temperature of the primary star ( @xmath21 ) may have some uncertainties due to the very wide spectral lines coming from the binary and the presence of the lines coming from the third body .",
    "we use the color index of ii uma to estimate the real uncertainties of @xmath21 . according to the color index ( b - v = 0.447 ) given by the tycho-2 catalogue , the spectral type of ii uma is f5 .",
    "however , the 2mass all sky catalogue gives the color index of j - h = 0.189 @xcite , which corresponds to a spectral type of f3 .",
    "and the color index of v - k = 1.089 also supports that the spectral type is f5 @xcite .",
    "thus , the effective temperature of the primary star ( @xmath21 ) may range from 6550k to 6680k .",
    "solution b of @xmath22 is also list in table 4 . according to @xcite s work",
    ", we also set @xmath23 and give solution c in table 4 .",
    "we can conclude that solution a , solution b and solution c give out almost consistent results although @xmath21 ranges from 6412k to 6680k .",
    "light curves solutions indicate that ii uma is an overcontact binary system with a quite high contact degree ( @xmath24 ) and an extremely low mass ratio ( @xmath25 ) , which indicate that it is at the final evolutionary stage of cool short - period binaries .",
    "it may merge into a single rapid - rotation star , which may be the progenitor of blue straggler or fk com - type star @xcite .",
    "the two components have nearly the same surface temperature ( @xmath26 ) in spite of their quite different masses and radii , which indicate that the system is under thermal contact . considering the mass function given by @xcite : @xmath19 and the orbital inclination ( @xmath27 ) obtained by the light curves solutions ,",
    "the mass of the two components are calculated to be @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "spectroscopic search carried out by @xcite confirmed that ii uma was a triple system with a solar - type tertiary component , and determined the effective temperature of the third component to be @xmath30 , which corresponded to a g0v type star .",
    "the mass of the third component is estimated to be @xmath31 according to the mass ratio ( @xmath8 ) obtained . the third light ( @xmath32 ) is also included as an adjustable parameter during the photometric processing .",
    "the light curve solutions also confirm that it is a triple system and the third component contributes nearly a quarter of the total luminosity . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the existence of the third light reduces the occultation depth apparently .",
    "spectroscopic observations show that ii uma may be a contact binary with its primary component to be a giant star .",
    "it does have a quite long period ( p=0.82522d ) which does not obey the well - defined period - color relation of contact binary .",
    "however , the parameters obtained by us show that the radius of the apparent giant is equal to about 2.7@xmath33",
    ". the 2@xmath34 star should have a radius equal to about 3.5@xmath33 when it leaves ms .",
    "thus , the primary star of ii uma has evolved from zero age main sequence ( zams ) , but it is still before terminal age main sequence ( tams ) .",
    "ii uma is one of the a - type w uma stars .",
    "detailed modeling by @xcite concluded that initially detached binary systems will eventually evolve to main sequence contact binaries or algol - type binary systems .",
    "we assume that ii uma is formed from an initially detached system via angular momentum loss ( aml ) by means of magnetic stellar wind .",
    "it is just under the late evolutionary stage of late - type tidal - locked binary stars , which might be close to merging and evolving into a single rapid - rotating star .",
    "ii uma is a member of a visual binary system .",
    "the close binary system is even confirmed to be a triple system with a close - in solar - type tertiary component orbiting around the close binary system .",
    "thus , it is actually a quadruple system . as discussed by @xcite",
    ", the existence of an additional stellar component in the binary system may play an important role for the formation and evolution by removing angular momentum from the central binary system during the early dynamical interaction or late evolution .",
    "the @xmath10-@xmath11 curve analysis shows a continuous period increase at a rate of @xmath12 , which may be just a part of a cyclic period change , or the combinational period change of a parabolic variation and a cyclic one .",
    "more times of minimum light are needed to confirm this .",
    "ii uma is an important target for testing theories of star formation and stellar dynamical evolution and interaction .",
    "it is possible that third - body interactions in the birth environment may help to accelerate the orbital evolution of the central binary system .",
    "angular momentum is drained from the inner close pair either by the ejection of the tertiary companion or through the kozai mechanism @xcite .",
