    "the sdw gives way to a haldane insulator ( hi ) , and a quantum phase transition takes place between the hi and the cdw when @xmath2 increases . if this hi - cdw ising transition line meets a first - order transition line , a tricritical ising point appears .",

    "the quantum phase transition line between the insulating cdw and pi phases belongs to the universality class of the two - dimensional ising model ,  @xcite and has been argued to terminate in a tricritical point , where the phase transition changes from continuous to first order .",
