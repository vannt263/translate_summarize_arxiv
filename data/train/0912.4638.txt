    "assessing the neutrino mass scale is one of the major challenges in today particle physics and astrophysics .",
    "this requires to measure the mass of one of the three neutrinos and the kinematical neutrino mass measurement is the only model independent method . in particular , the electron anti - neutrino mass can be measured by precisely analyzing the kinematics of electrons emitted in beta decays . in practice",
    "this means measuring the minimum energy carried away by the anti - neutrino , i.e. its rest mass , by observing the highest energy electrons emitted in the decay . to date , the study of the  beta decay end - point by means of electrostatic spectrometers has proved to be the most sensitive approach , yielding an upper limit on the electron anti - neutrino mass of 2.2ev@xcite . starting from 2012",
    "the new experiment katrin will analyze the  beta decay end - point with a much more sensitive electrostatic spectrometer and with an expected statistical sensitivity of about 0.2ev@xcite    however , these spectrometric experiments suffer from many systematic uncertainties because the measured electron energy has to be corrected for the energy lost in exciting atomic and molecular states , in crossing the source , in scattering through the spectrometer , and more . to avoid these uncertainties",
    "it was proposed to embed the beta source in a detector and to perform a so called calorimetric measurement .",
    "ideally , in such a configuration for each decay the detector measures all the energy released except for the energy carried away by the neutrino .",
    "a drawback of calorimetry is that a calorimeter is forced to detect all the beta decays while only the ones very close to the end - point @xmath0 are useful for measuring the neutrino mass .",
    "the fraction of useful decays in a small interval  below @xmath0 is approximately given by @xmath1 , therefore it pays out to select a beta decaying isotope with the lowest @xmath0 value . in the past",
    ", calorimetric neutrino mass experiments have been performed implanting  in silicon diode detectors @xcite . the use of  as beta source seems more promising since it is the beta - active nuclide with the second lowest known transition energy ( @xmath2kev ) . in the 80s s.vitale",
    "proposed to realize calorimetric neutrino mass using  as beta source and exploiting the thermal detection technique @xcite . since then",
    "two experiments of this kind has been carried out : the manu@xcite and mibeta@xcite experiments .",
    "manu used one detector with a ntd thermistor glued to a 1.6 mg metallic rhenium single crystal , while mibeta used an array of ten silicon implanted thermistors with  crystals for a total mass of about 2.2 mg .",
    "the two experiments collected statistics corresponding to 10@xmath3 and 1.7@xmath4 decays respectively , yielding limits on  of about 26ev at 95% cl and 15ev at 90% cl respectively .",
    "recent developments in the thermal detection technique let think about a new very large calorimetric experiment aiming at a sub - ev sensitivity : this it what the mare project is about @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a comprehensive discussion of the potential sensitivity to the neutrino mass for a calorimetric experiment .",
    "first , through an analytical approach , we derive an algorithm to assess the statistical sensitivity for a given experimental configuration .",
    "then a montecarlo method is described which allows to get more precise statistical sensitivity estimates .",
    "the results of the analytic approach are then validated through the comparison with the montecarlo results over a wide range of experimental parameters .",
    "the second part of this paper focuses on the systematic uncertainties peculiar to the calorimetric technique by applying extensively the montecarlo approach to their investigation .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the possible experimental configurations for future large scale calorimetric experiments .",
    "in the following we derive an approximate analytic expression for the statistical sensitivity of a calorimetric neutrino mass experiment . the primary effect of a finite mass @xmath5 on the beta spectrum is to cause the spectrum to turn more sharply down to zero a distance @xmath5 below the end - point @xmath0 ( lower panel of figure[fig : sensi ] ) . to rule out a finite mass",
    ", we must be sensitive to the number of counts expected in this interval .",
    "the fraction of the total spectrum within an interval @xmath6 below the end - point @xmath0 is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the beta energy spectrum for a neutrino mass @xmath9 and normalized to unity .",
    "the signal to detect in counts is therefore @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the single detector source activity , @xmath12 is the number of identical detectors and @xmath13 is the measuring time ( see lower panel of figure[fig : sensi ] ) .",
    "higher panel : beta spectrum as in ( [ eq : quad ] ) compared with pile - up spectrum ( [ eq : npp ] ) .",
    "lower panel : zoom around the end point , with a comparison between 0 and finite - neutrino - mass beta spectra ]    the detection of this signal is impaired by the _ noise _ caused by the statistical fluctuations of the total measured spectrum in the interval @xmath6 . for a calorimeter the total measured spectrum is obtained summing up  from all detectors  the beta decay events , the counts due to unresolved pile - up of two or more decays , and any additional background counts .    as a first approximation we can neglect the pile - up of more than two decays .",
    "we can then crudely approximate the pile - up spectrum by assuming a constant pulse - pair resolving time , @xmath14 , such that events with greater separation are always detected as being doubles , while those at smaller separations are always interpreted as singles with an apparent energy equal to the sum of the two events .",
    "in fact , the resolving time will depend on the amplitude of both events , and the sum amplitude will depend on the separation time and the filter used , so a proper calculation would have to be done as a monte carlo with the actual filters and pulse - pair detection algorithm being used . however , this approximation is good enough to get the correct scaling and an approximate answer .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 is related to the detector signal bandwith and high frequency signal - to - noise ratio : in practice @xmath14 is of the order of the detector rise time .",
    "the two event pile spectrum is given by @xmath15 and the fraction of this spectrum within the interval @xmath6 below the end - point @xmath0 is obtained by @xmath16 where , at first order , @xmath17 is the probability for the two event pile - up to occur , i.e. the fraction of unresolved pile - up events , @xmath18 .",
    "from ( [ eq : frac ] ) and ( [ eq : frac_pp ] ) one can write the _ noise _ in counts as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the average background counting rate for unit energy and for a single detector",

    "the same applies to the solution of ( [ eq : sens_eq_2 ] ) .",
    "the two terms in the square bracket in ( [ eq : sensitivity ] ) represent the contributions to the _ noise _ from the statistical fluctuations of the beta and pile - up spectra respectively ( here we neglect the background term for sake of clarity ) . when the pile - up term is negligible ( because of the low rate @xmath11 or of the short resolving time @xmath14 ) the left term dominates and it pays out to keep @xmath6 as small as possible : the limit is of course the detector energy resolution . on the other extreme ,",
    "when the end - point of the beta spectrum is buried in the pile - up spectrum , the _ noise _ is dominated by the right term . in this case",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio improves by enlarging the energy interval @xmath41 .",
    "it is then clear that there is no defined value of @xmath6 to plug in ( [ eq : sensitivity ] ) : the solution we have found is to choose @xmath6 as the value that minimizes @xmath24 for a given set of experimental parameters , with the boundary condition that @xmath6 can not be smaller than the detector energy resolution .    in particular , for the simpler case of ( [ eq : sensitivity ] ) , by searching the positive zero of the derivative with respect to , we can obtain the following @xmath42    this approach for defining  can be applied to the solution of ( [ eq : sens_eq_2 ] ) as well . in this case  can be evaluated numerically following the above prescriptions . in particular to obtain the results presented in this paper , after making the substitution @xmath43 , we have found numerically the @xmath44 which minimizes the solution of ( [ eq : sens_eq_2 ] ) @xmath45 it is worth noting that , in this analysis , equations ( [ eq : de_opt ] ) and ( [ eq : de_opt_2 ] ) are the only places where the detector energy resolution @xmath46 shows up .      in this section",
    "we describe a frequentist montecarlo code developed to estimate the statistical sensitivity of a neutrino mass experiment performed with thermal calorimeters .",
