    "in the current cellular systems , each base station is considered as a separate entity with no cooperation among base stations , infrastructure cooperation among base stations has been proposed in the literature such as @xcite , which is to consider the base stations as one end of a mimo system that has received a great deal of attention as a method to achieve high data rates over wireless links .",
    "thus , in this paper , we study a @xmath0-user mimo mac uplink system and a @xmath0-user mimo bc downlink system . both of them can be seen as a cellular system with multiple users and multiple cooperating base station antennas : either multiple cooperating base stations each with a single antenna or a single - cell cellular system with a multi - antenna base station or a combination thereof . in the mac or the bc ,",
    "data is buffered at the transmit end and the channel is time - varying due to multipath fading , which is a typical feature of wireless channel and brings additional complexity for system design and performance analysis .",
    "we suppose that the fading process is a fs - ctmc whose discrete time version is widely used in modeling wireless channels ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-user capacity regions of the mac and the bc are both time - varying set - valued stochastic processes driven by the fs - ctmc and in each state of the markov chain , it is well known that one can obtain the improved capacity by cooperation , e.g. , the sum of the rates at which data can be served for the @xmath0 users is greater than the single - user capacity for any user ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , due to the impact of the random environmental fading factor and the cooperated design , the service rates of the corresponding queueing system for the @xmath0 users in the mac or in the bc are also random processes driven by the fs - ctmc .",
    "so , motivated by the above observations , we consider a type of generalized processor - sharing queues living in a random environment , whose job arrivals to each queue follow a dsrp . both the random environment and the random arrival rate of each dsrp",
    "are driven by a fs - ctmc .",
    "presently , for such a queueing system , it is not known how to choose a reasonable online rate scheduling policy to minimize the average delay for a given load and exact solutions for average delay are not available even for many simple policies , which implies that any meaningful comparison has to be done by simulations .",
    "therefore , to make the gap between the dynamic rate scheduling and the performance optimization for the system be filled to some extent , we design a dynamic rate scheduling policy of markov type via the solution ( a social optimal nash equilibrium point ) to an optimization problem that maximizes a general utility function over each of the randomly evolving capacity regions through the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) optimality conditions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , to overcome the intractability of performance evaluation for the system under the designed policy , we develop stochastic fluid and diffusion models through suitable scaling of time and space and justifying related limit theorems for a heavily loaded queueing system operating under this policy .",
    "the limit models for queue lengths ( or workloads ) are respectively a random process driven by the fs - ctmc and a rdrs ( i.e. , a reflecting stochastic differential equation ( sde ) with regime - switching ) .",
    "in addition , we identify a cost function related to the utility function , which is minimized through minimizing the workload process in the diffusion limit and hence provides a useful means in illustrating our policy to be asymptotically optimal .",
    "finally , in order to incorporate the @xmath0-user mimo mac and mimo bc into our general queueing framework , we justify that the @xmath0-user capacity region for the mac or the bc in any particular channel state is a convex set formed by a number of linear or smooth curved facets through applying the method of convex optimization , the implicit function theorem , and the duality of capacity regions between the mac and the bc .",
    "moreover , to realize the dsrp in the mac or in the bc , we adopt a cross - layer design methodology to switch the arrival rates with the fs - ctmc channel fading process according to the current channel state information ( csi ) through admission control .",
    "0.25 cm * literature review *    the randomly evolving capacity region used in designing our utility - maximization rate scheduling policy is a generalization of the so - called mimo channel capacity region in the shannon theoretic sense . for a single - user time - invariant channel",
    ", the shannon capacity is defined as the maximum mutual information between input and output , which is shown by shannon s capacity theorem to be the maximum data rate that can be transmitted over the channel with arbitrarily small error probability . for a @xmath0-user time - invariant mimo channel ,",
    "the corresponding capacity region is a @xmath0-dimensional set of all rate vectors @xmath1 simultaneously achievable by all @xmath0 users . in particular , the region for the gaussian mac is a convex set that is the union of rate regions corresponding to every product input distribution satisfying the user - by - user power constraints ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the gaussian bc differs from the gaussian mac in two fundamental aspects ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the mac",
    ", each transmitter has an individual power constraint , whereas in the bc there is only a single power constraint on the transmitter .",
    "moreover , signal and interference come from different transmitters in the mac and are multiplied by different channels gains ( known as the near - far effect ) before being received , whereas in the bc , the entire received signal comes from the same source and therefore has the same channel gain .",
    "nevertheless , the capacity region for the gaussian bc can be obtained through the duality between the gaussian mac and the gaussian bc ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , i.e. , it is the convex hull of the union over the set of capacity regions of the dual gaussian macs such that the total mac power is the same as the power in the bc .",
    "moreover , the authors in @xcite provide an analytical and numerical characterization in terms of the shape of the capacity boundaries for both the mac and the bc .    however , in both the gaussian mac and the gaussian bc , the exact characterization concerning piecewise smoothness of the capacity boundaries is not available until now , which motivates us to give more accurate analysis about the capacity region in order to apply our utility maximization rate scheduling algorithm to these wireless systems .",
    "in addition , when the @xmath0-user mimo channels are stochastic and time - varying fading ones , the capacity regions have multiple definitions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . nevertheless , to capture the exact capacity region at each time instant for the mac or the bc , we consider the capacity regions as a set - valued stochastic process evolving with the fs - ctmc rather than think of it as a fixed one in an average sense such as an ergodic capacity region ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    concerning the scheduling algorithms , the authors in @xcite considered a quasi - static downlink channel , where the channel is assumed to be fixed for all transmissions over the period of interest . in this case ,",
    "the fs - ctmc and the random packet arrival rates assumed in the current paper reduce to constants , and moreover , without considering utility and cost optimization , the authors in @xcite designed a simple rate scheduling policy of markov type , which was shown to be throughput - optimal for a fixed convex capacity region in @xcite and a limit theorem was proved to justify the diffusion approximation of the queue length process for a heavily loaded system operating under their policy with two users in @xcite and with multiple users in @xcite .",
    "their approximating model is a rbm living in the two - dimensional positive quadrant or in the general - dimensional positive orthant .    in the studies of @xcite",
    ", some scheduling policies were considered for certain heavily loaded wireless systems with finite state discrete time markov fading process . in particular , a maxweight scheduling policy was considered in @xcite for a generalized switch and it was shown that the workload process converges to a one - dimensional rbm and maxweight policy asymptotically minimizes the workload under certain conditions . moreover ,",
    "an exponential scheduling rule was designed for wireless channels in @xcite and for a generalized switch in @xcite , which was proved to be throughput - optimal and under which , the similar results concerning the workload process were obtained and justified as in @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite designed a utility - maximizing resource allocation policy for a class of stochastic networks with concurrent occupancy of resources and established its asymptotic optimality for the associated heavily loaded queueing system .",
    "their policy covers the generalized @xmath2-rule in  @xcite and the maxweight policy in  @xcite as special cases .",
    "the differences between the current study and those in @xcite are in three aspects as follows .",
    "first , their scheduling policies in @xcite depend only on a fixed capacity region that is a convex polyhedral and ours depends on a time - varying and stochastic evolving capacity region process ( a random environment ) that , at each time instant , is a more general convex region rather than a convex polyhedral .",
    "second , the rates of packet arrivals to the @xmath0 users are random processes rather than a constant as used in @xcite . hence our input traffic to each user is a dsrp whose particular case is the well - known doubly stochastic poisson process ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that is widely used to model voice , video and data source traffics in telecommunication systems and is called markovian modulated poisson process ( mmpp ) or on / off source ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and @xcite ) ) .",
    "third , our discussion is based on a continuous time horizon rather than a discrete one as in @xcite .",
    "therefore our vector - valued random service rate process depends on the fs - ctmc whose holding time at each environmental state has an important impact on the limiting processes , e.g. , the limiting fluid model is a random process driven by the fs - ctmc rather than a deterministic function of time and the limiting diffusion model is a more general rdrs rather than a rbm as derived in @xcite .",
    "if one wants to directly generalize the studies in @xcite to the corresponding ones in a discrete time random environment , a geometric distribution may be imposed on the holding time at each environmental state .",
    "finally , without considering optimal dynamic scheduling with utility / cost and performance optimizations as the goals .",
    "ctmcs have been used to model the random environments in the studies of some queueing systems under certain static service disciplines , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein for more details .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ aqsy ]",
    ", we introduce our generalized processor - sharing queues under random environment and design our optimal rate scheduling policy . in section  [ apmodel ] ,",
    "we introduce our heavy traffic condition and present our main asymptotic optimality theorem . in section  [ wnm ] , we illustrate the usages of our optimal policy and our main results in the @xmath0-user mimo uplink and downlink wireless channels and present the associated results concerning the piecewise smoothness of capacity boundaries of the @xmath0-user mimo mac and mimo bc . in sections",
    "[ proofmains]-[prooflemmas ] , we prove our main theorem and associated lemmas .",
    "the queueing system under consideration is a type of generalized processor - sharing queues that live in a random environment evolving according to a stationary fs - ctmc @xmath3 , which takes value in a finite state space @xmath4 with generator matrix @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the holding rate for the chain in an environmental state @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the transition matrix of its embedded discrete time markov chain ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the queueing system has @xmath0 queues in parallel , which correspond to @xmath0 users for a given positive integer @xmath0 .",
    "each queue that is of infinite buffer capacity buffers packets ( jobs ) arrived for a given user .",
    "the queues can be served simultaneously by a single server with rate allocation vector @xmath11 that takes values in a time - varying and randomly evolving capacity set @xmath12 .",

    "i.e. , @xmath23 moreover , if we let @xmath24 denote the sum capacity upper bound for the capacity region , then the facet in the center of the capacity surface is linear and can be expressed by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the index corresponding to @xmath24 . moreover",
    ", we suppose that any one of the @xmath0 linear facets along the coordinate axes forms a @xmath16-user capacity region corresponding to a particular group of @xmath27 users who are the only users in the systems .",

    "first of all , we remark that the service discipline used in this paper is the so - called head of line discipline under which the service goes to the packet at the head of the line for a serving queue where packets are stored in the order of their arrivals .",
    "the service rates are determined by a function of the environmental state and the number of packets in each of the queues . at each state",
    "@xmath13 and for a given queue length vector @xmath48 , let @xmath49 denote the corresponding rate vector ( in bps ) of serving the @xmath0 queues , which is a solution of the following utility maximization problem @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a @xmath0-dimensional vector and @xmath52 for each @xmath32 is a utility function defined on @xmath21 , which is second - order differentiable and satisfies the following conditions @xmath53 due to condition , we know that there must exist an optimal solution in the following form for a given @xmath54 , @xmath55 where @xmath56 for each @xmath57 and @xmath58 if @xmath59 .",

    "this type of sdes without boundary reflections has received a great attention in the area of financial engineering ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in this section , we apply the discussions in the previous sections to a cellular system where base stations cooperate among noise - free infinite capacity links .",
    "we do not make any distinction between a single - cell cellular system having multiple base - station antennas and the traditional cellular system with cooperating single - antenna base stations . here",
    ", the cooperation means that the base stations can perform joint beamforming and/or power control but there is a constraint on the total power that the base stations can share .",
    "therefore , our wireless system can be considered consisting of a base station having @xmath143 antennas and @xmath0 users ( mobiles ) , each of which has @xmath144 antennas .",
    "thus the uplink channel can be modeled as a @xmath0-user mimo mac and the downlink channel can be modeled as a @xmath0-user mimo bc ( see , e.g. , figure  [ tthuserregion ] ) .",
    "= 3.0 in    the channel fading is supposed to obey the stationary fs - ctmc @xmath3 that is described in the previous sections .",
    "moreover , we suppose that the receive or transmit end ( the cooperating base stations ) has perfect csi . for each channel state @xmath13 , we let @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) denote the downlink channel matrix from the base station to user @xmath34 . assuming the same channel is used on the uplink and downlink , then the uplink matrix of user @xmath34 is @xmath147 that is the conjugate transpose of @xmath145 .",
    "moreover , at the transmit end , arriving packets for each user are buffered before transmission and the rate of arrivals is a random process that switches with the fs - ctmc channel fading through admission control .",

    "then we prove a claim in lemma  [ costcc ] , which states that when the system state is close to the unique optimal solution to the cost minimization problem ( called _ a fixed point _ ) , the capacity of the system will be fully utilized .",
    "the claims stated in lemmas  [ equioptso]-[costcc ] are similar to their counterparts in @xcite , nevertheless , their concrete proofs are different due to the different problem formulations and the difference of the capacity constraints between the two studies .",
    "secondly , in subsection  [ equidis ] , we present an equivalent queueing model due to the assumption imposed on the fs - ctmc and justify a functional central limit theorem ( lemma  [ primconlm ] ) for a dsrp whose arrival rate process is driven by the fs - ctmc . the main idea used in proving lemma  [ primconlm ]",
    "is stemmed from the related discussion in @xcite , @xcite and the concrete proving techniques include the conventional functional central limit theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , random change of time lemma ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , establishment of oscillation inequality ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , equivalent conditions of relative compactness and skorohod representation theorem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and etc .",
    "thirdly , in subsection  [ fluidlim ] , we derive the fluid limit processes for the physical processes under fluid scaling in lemma  [ fluidlemma ] and study the asymptotic behavior for the fluid limit processes as time evolves in lemma  [ uniattrack ] .",
    "fluid limits are widely used as an intermediate step in justifying diffusion approximations ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , our fluid limit is a random process driven by the fs - ctmc rather than a deterministic function of time as obtained in the existing studies .",
    "this new feature brings us additional complexity in proving lemma  [ fluidlemma ] and lemma  [ uniattrack ] , e.g. , comparing with the study in @xcite , it requires more technical treatment in handling the fs - ctmc based jumps for the constructed lyapunov function .",
    "therefore , by noticing this new feature and the difference between our optimal scheduling policy and the one in @xcite , we develop a theory through combining and generalizing the discussions in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to finish the justifications of lemma  [ fluidlemma ] and lemma  [ uniattrack ] .",
    "fourthly , in subsection  [ slowerfs ] , we study the convergence of the workload and queue length processes on a finer time - scale , which is an important step in justifying the main result of the paper .",
    "this method has appeared in queueing literature for a while ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and etc . )",
    "the main difference between ours and the existing works is as follows : all the processes concerned in our study involve the jumps introduced by the random environment and in the meanwhile the processes in existing studies do not involve this type of jumps .",
    "therefore we develop a scheme and incorporate it into the framework as used in @xcite to finish the proof of the convergence properties for the processes on a finer time - scale .",
    "finally , in subsection  [ mainthp ] , we combine the results obtained in the previous subsections with the uniqueness of solution to an associated skorohod problem and the minimality of the skorohod problem to provide a proof for theorem  [ rsdifth ] .",
    "this type of techniques have been used in the studies concerning network scheduling ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and etc . ) nevertheless , our justification logic and technical treatment are somewhat different .",
    "[ firstl ] consider the utility - maximization problem in and suppose conditions - and are imposed , then for a sequence of queue states , @xmath191 , which satisfies @xmath192 as @xmath193 , we have @xmath194 for each @xmath13 and any @xmath32 such that @xmath195 .",

    "hence @xmath252 for each @xmath135 is an optimal solution to with @xmath206 in the utility function .",
    "@xmath196    0.15 cm next , let @xmath253 denote the norm of a vector @xmath254 in the sense that @xmath255 .",

    "for the first part in the lemma , we have the following observations . due to condition , we know that @xmath218 is strictly convex in @xmath54 for each @xmath219 .",
    "so the cost minimization problem in has a unique optimal solution @xmath198 when @xmath256 is in the cost function .",
    "moreover , the continuity of @xmath134 in terms of @xmath86 for each @xmath13 can be proved similarly as in @xcite .    for the second part in the lemma",

    "therefore , along @xmath729 , we have @xmath730 in addition , if @xmath731 and @xmath732 , then it follows from that @xmath733 thus , by , we know that @xmath734 since the given time @xmath88 is arbitrarily taken , it follows from , and that the claim in the theorem is true for any @xmath33 .    in the end",
    ", it follows from and that is true .",
    "hence we finish the proof of theorem  [ rsdifth ] .",
    "first of all , to be convenient for readers , we outline the proofs of the two lemmas as follows :    for the proof of lemma  [ smoothsurfaces ] , we first use the optimization technique studied in @xcite and @xcite to characterize the boundary of the mac capacity region presented in , i.e. , the region in is convex and thus the boundary of it can be fully characterized by maximizing the function @xmath735 over all rate vectors in the region and for all nonnegative priority vectors @xmath736 such that @xmath737 . then , based on priority vectors and permutation schemes , we can determine the number of boundary pieces of the region , which is consistent with what is obtained in @xcite . finally , by applying the kkt optimality conditions and the implicit function theorem , we can prove that the boundary of the mac capacity region consists of the derived number of linear or smooth curved facets .",
    "notice that , for a fixed priority vector @xmath738 , the optimization characterization described in the outline is equivalent to finding the point on the capacity boundary that is tangent to a line whose slope is defined by the priority vector . due to the structure of the capacity region , we can see that all boundary points of the region are corner points of polyhedrons corresponding to different sets of covariance matrices .",
    "in addition , the corner point should correspond to successive decoding in order of increasing priority , i.e. , the user with the highest priority should be decoded last and , therefore , sees no interference .",
    "hence , by @xcite and @xcite , the problem of finding the boundary point on the capacity region associated with a descending ordered priority vector @xmath738 can be written as @xmath739 where @xmath740 which is concave in the covariance matrices .",
    "now , let @xmath741 for @xmath742 and @xmath743 .",
    "then , for any integer @xmath744 , let @xmath745 denote the following set corresponding to exactly having @xmath62 indices @xmath746 such that @xmath747 , i.e. , @xmath748 moreover , if @xmath749 , we use @xmath750 to denote the set corresponding to @xmath751 for all @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath752 in addition , if @xmath753 , @xmath754 , we use @xmath755 to denote the following set corresponding to @xmath754 , @xmath756 eventually , we can define @xmath757 thus we have @xmath758    note that the @xmath0 users can be arbitrarily ordered , so we have @xmath759 such priority orders , e.g. , @xmath760 , where @xmath761 is a permutation of @xmath762 . thus we can see that our capacity region is bounded by @xmath166 boundary pieces with @xmath166 given by .",
    "in fact , the first term @xmath759 on the right - hand side of the first equality in is the number of boundary pieces corresponding to all @xmath763 , @xmath764 ( @xmath765 ) is the number of boundary pieces corresponding to all @xmath766 with @xmath767 and @xmath768 for @xmath769 when @xmath770 , and the last term @xmath0 on the right - hand side of is the number of boundary pieces corresponding to @xmath771 . here",
    "we remark that the number of boundary pieces obtained through the above method is consistent with the one derived in @xcite .",
    "next we show the smoothness of these boundary pieces . without loss of generality ,",
    "our discussion will focus on a specific set @xmath750 in a particular user priority order since the discussions for all other cases are similar .",
    "therefore , we have that @xmath772 . moreover , let @xmath773 denote the @xmath774-dimensional vector formed by the real part and the imaginary part of entries of @xmath775, ... ,@xmath776 in a suitable order .",
    "thus we know that @xmath777 is concave in @xmath778 for each given @xmath561 .",
    "then the optimization problem in can be restated as follows .",
    "@xmath779 subject to @xmath780 so it follows from the kkt optimality conditions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that the solution to the optimization problem in - for a function @xmath781 with the associated @xmath561 can be obtained through the following equations , @xmath782 where @xmath783 for @xmath32 are the lagrangian multipliers",
    ". then our remaining discussion can be divided into the following two steps .    * step one : * if there exists some @xmath784 such that the problem in - for the function @xmath781 has at least one optimal solution located in the interior of the associated feasible region , where @xmath785 then we have the following discussions .",
    "firstly , we suppose that the optimal solution is unique given by @xmath786 . then we know that @xmath787 is strictly concave since it is sufficiently smooth in @xmath778 for the given @xmath738 due to the definition of @xmath788 .",
    "so it follows from - that @xmath789 moreover , it follows from theorem 4.3.1 in page 115 of @xcite that the following hessian matrix @xmath790 is positive definite at all @xmath778 within the @xmath774-dimensional feasible region .",
    "now define @xmath791 thus we know that @xmath792 and the jacobian determinant of @xmath793 with respect to @xmath778 at @xmath794 is nonzero due to , i.e. , @xmath795 therefore @xmath793 satisfies all the conditions as stated in the implicit function theorem . hence @xmath796 uniquely determines a @xmath774-dimensional function @xmath797 that is continuous and differentiable with respect to @xmath738 in a neighborhood @xmath798 of @xmath738 . moreover , and hold in @xmath798 , which implies that @xmath797 is an optimal solution to the problem in - for each @xmath799 .",
    "secondly , we suppose that the problem in - for the function @xmath800 has multiple optimal solutions located in the interior of the associated feasible region . without loss of generality",
    ", we suppose that these optimal points are all in a @xmath62-dimensional hyperplane that is parallel to each coordinate - axis corresponding to those @xmath778 with part of its components , @xmath801 , where @xmath802 ( here we remark that , if this is not the case , we can employ the method of rotation transformation to make this case true . ) therefore , due to and the concavity of @xmath787 in @xmath778 , we know that @xmath787 is independent of @xmath803 . thus there exists a @xmath804-dimensional set @xmath805 corresponding to each @xmath738 such that @xmath787 only depends on @xmath806 ( the complementary set of @xmath807 ) and is strictly concave in those @xmath808 . therefore for any optimal point @xmath797 in the set @xmath805 and by considering the similar @xmath804-dimensional problem as in -",
    ", we can conclude that @xmath797 is continuous and differentiable in a neighborhood @xmath798 of @xmath738 .",
    "so , if the optimal points of @xmath787 are all strictly located within the feasible region when @xmath738 moves in @xmath809 , it follows from the above discussion that @xmath787 keeps either strictly concave or flat with respect to @xmath806 or @xmath801 for all @xmath784 .",
    "thus we can conclude that all the optimal paths @xmath797 are continuous and differentiable with respect to @xmath784 .",
    "in other words , any set @xmath810 of the optimal covariance matrices is continuous and differentiable with respect to @xmath784 .",
    "hence it follows from that the corner points of the capacity region , which are determined by the following equations , form a smooth curved facet @xmath811 when @xmath738 moves in the region @xmath809 , and moreover , the facet does not depend on the choice of the set @xmath812 along @xmath784 .",
    "in addition , due to , for all @xmath32 , we have @xmath813    however , if some optimal point of @xmath787 reaches one of the boundaries of the feasible region when @xmath738 moves in @xmath809 , then the associated justification for this case is part of the proof in the following step two .    * step two : * without loss of generality",
    ", we suppose that @xmath787 is strictly concave for all @xmath784 and otherwise we can employ the similar argument as above .",
    "therefore , if @xmath786 is the solution to the optimization problem in - , which is located on one of the boundary pieces , and if @xmath814 for some @xmath815 is the set of components of @xmath816 , which are either @xmath817 or on the surface @xmath818 for some @xmath32 since @xmath819 depends only on part of the components of @xmath778 , then the remaining components of @xmath816 are located in the interior of the corresponding @xmath804-dimensional feasible region and satisfy @xmath820 for each @xmath821 , where @xmath822 and @xmath823 ( @xmath824 ) are the lagrangian multipliers corresponding to @xmath816 .",
    "now let @xmath825 denote the vector whose components @xmath808 for all @xmath826 are confined in @xmath827 .",
    "then @xmath787 is strictly concave in the components of @xmath778 except those @xmath828 since it is sufficiently smooth in @xmath778 and since @xmath829 with @xmath830 is in the interior of the corresponding @xmath804-dimensional feasible region .",
    "thus it follows from theorem 4.3.1 in page 115 of @xcite that the following hessian matrix @xmath831 is positive definite at all @xmath778 whose components @xmath808 for all @xmath826 are confined in @xmath827 .",
    "moreover , if we define @xmath832 we can conclude that the jacobian determinant of @xmath833 with respect to @xmath834 @xmath835 and @xmath836 ( @xmath837 ) is nonzero at @xmath816 .",
    "moreover , due to the definition of @xmath787 and @xmath819 for @xmath32 , we know that @xmath833 satisfies all the conditions as stated in the implicit function theorem . hence @xmath838 uniquely determines a @xmath839-dimensional function @xmath840 that is continuous and differentiable in @xmath784 ( where @xmath841 is the number of @xmath842 ( @xmath843 ) such that @xmath844 ) , and moreover , all the components @xmath845 with @xmath826 are confined in @xmath827 when @xmath784 moves .",
    "therefore the remaining proof of this boundary situation can be divided into the following three cases .",
    "_ case one : _",
    "when @xmath846 continuously moves to a vector @xmath784 , the optimal point @xmath847 moves from the interior of the feasible region to the optimal point @xmath848 on the boundary of the feasible region .",
    "then we need to prove that @xmath847 and its associated derivatives converge to @xmath797 and its corresponding derivatives as @xmath849 converges to @xmath738 continuously within a neighborhood of @xmath784 in the whole @xmath850-dimensional feasible region , which implies that the components @xmath851 for all @xmath826 are not necessarily confined in @xmath827 when @xmath846 moves .",
    "in fact , let @xmath852 and define the following constraints of parallel surfaces , @xmath853 where @xmath854 is an arbitrary constant vector whose components are given by @xmath855 ( @xmath824 ) and @xmath856 ( @xmath857 ) .",
    "therefore , by applying the kkt optimality conditions , the optimal solution @xmath858 to the the problem with the constraints - should be given by the following equations @xmath859 for each @xmath821 , where @xmath860 ( @xmath824 ) and @xmath861 ( @xmath857 ) are the related lagrangian multipliers corresponding to @xmath858 .",
    "now , for each @xmath862 , define @xmath863 then , by the similar argument as used for , we know that there is a unique @xmath839-dimensional optimal path @xmath864 which is continuous and differentiable with respect to @xmath865 ( where @xmath866 is the dimension of @xmath854 ) , and moreover , all the components of @xmath867 corresponding to @xmath868 satisfy the constraints - , either being @xmath869 ( @xmath870 ) or on the boundary @xmath871 ( @xmath837 ) .",
    "thus we know that @xmath867 and its associated derivatives converge to @xmath797 and its corresponding derivatives as @xmath872 converges to @xmath873 continuously .",
    "moreover , notice that @xmath874 when @xmath875 ( @xmath870 ) and @xmath876 ( @xmath843 ) are all close to zero , which implies that all the components of @xmath867 corresponding to @xmath868 are also continuous and differentiable with respect to @xmath877 when @xmath875 ( @xmath870 ) and @xmath876 ( @xmath837 ) are all close to zero .",
    "so we can conclude that @xmath847 and its associated derivatives converge to @xmath797 and its associated derivatives as @xmath878 , which implies that @xmath797 is continuous and differentiable at a neighborhood of @xmath738 in the whole @xmath850-dimensional feasible region .",
    "_ case two : _ when @xmath846 moves to a vector @xmath879 , the optimal point @xmath847 moves to the optimal point @xmath797 ( @xmath880 ) from a boundary piece of the feasible region next to the boundary piece on which @xmath797 is located .",
    "the proof for this case is similar to the one as used in _ case one_. hence we omit it .",
    "_ case three : _ when @xmath846 moves to a vector @xmath879 , the optimal point @xmath847 moves to the optimal point @xmath797 ( @xmath880 ) from a boundary piece of the feasible region that is not next to the boundary piece on which @xmath797 is located .",
    "due to the concavity of @xmath881 , the optimal point @xmath847 must go first into the interior of the feasible region and then to the other boundary piece .",
    "therefore , the proof for this case is the same as the one as used in _ case one_.    in the end , we note that the boundary piece corresponding to @xmath882 is a @xmath0-dimensional linear facet , which is determined by the sum - rate capacity bound ( see , e.g. , @xcite for more details ) .",
    "hence we we finish the proof of lemma  [ smoothsurfaces ] .",
    "@xmath196      it follows from @xcite that the capacity region for the @xmath0-user mimo bc with @xmath175 and each @xmath13 is given by @xmath883 so , due to the similarity of structures between @xmath884 in and @xmath14 in , we can apply the similar discussion as for the mimo mac and the discussion in @xcite to conclude that the claims in the lemma are true .",
