    "high - precision measurements of chemical abundances at early cosmological epochs come from damped lyman-@xmath0 absorption systems ( dlas ) , arising in distant galaxies which intersect the lines of sight to high - redshift quasars .",
    "dlas are easily detected in quasar spectra due to their particularly high neutral hydrogen column densities [ @xmath2hi@xmath3 by definition , though voigt profile damping wings are seen at lower @xmath4hi@xmath5 .",
    "generally , they comprise a clumpy distribution of clouds , spread typically over a few hundred @xmath6 .",
    "detection levels for heavy element transitions in dlas are @xmath77 orders of magnitude below that for @xmath4hi@xmath8 .",
    "high resolution optical spectra reveal transitions from many redshifted uv species , allowing detailed heavy element abundance patterns to be studied .",
    "the metallicity of dlas  defined as the heavy element abundance with respect to hydrogen , relative to that of the solar neighbourhood : @xmath9 } \\equiv \\log_{10}[n({\\rm m})/n({\\rm h } ) ] - \\log_{10}[n({\\rm m})/n({\\rm h})]_\\odot$ ]  ranges over 2 orders of magnitude and is usually @xmath70.1solar or lower .",
    "the presence of dust in dlas is revealed by the relative depletion of refractory elements ( e.g.  fe ) with respect to those thought not to readily deplete onto dust grains ( e.g.  zn ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and by the suppression of blue light from the background quasar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these spectroscopic observations demonstrate that dlas arise along lines of sight through distant galaxies but they do not disclose details such as the galaxy s morphology , luminosity , mass or age .",
    "evidence for an increase in dla metallicity with cosmic time has emerged only gradually over the past few years from a number of different studies @xcite .",
    "the latter reference provides the most compelling statistical evidence so far since , using the full sample of 125 dlas , one sees a strong anti - correlation between [ m / h ] and absorption redshift , @xmath10 : kendall s @xmath11 is @xmath12 with an associated probability of @xmath13 .",
    "the need for such a large sample is due to the @xmath72dex scatter in [ m / h ] at a given epoch .",
    "the types of galaxies responsible for dlas can be investigated using direct imaging methods or comparison of spectroscopic data with models .",
    "the kinematics of optical resonance absorption transitions in low redshift dlas appear consistent with 2-component models : a rotating disk plus an extended halo @xcite .",
    "a recent detailed radio study of one particular dla at @xmath14 clearly shows that at least _ some _ dlas arise in the rotating disks of ordinary spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "high redshift ( @xmath15 ) dlas have been interpreted similarly , using detailed kinematic modelling to argue that they are rotating ensembles of clouds with further evidence for this interpretation coming from comparison of abundance ratios in dlas and the thick component of our galaxy s disk @xcite .    on the other hand , direct imaging of dlas at @xmath16 reveals the hosts to be a mix of irregulars , spirals and low surface - brightness galaxies ( lsbs ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a result further borne out by a blind 21-cm emission survey at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the observed number of dlas per unit redshift interval and the @xmath4hi@xmath8 distribution suggest that dlas at @xmath18 are a roughly equal mix of lsbs and spirals ; at higher redshift they are more likely to be dwarfs ( that subsequently merge ) since there are too few precursors of present - day disk galaxies to explain the data @xcite .",
    "fitting simple chemical evolution models to an observed @xmath4hi@xmath8[zn / h ] distribution suggests that at redshifts @xmath19 , about half of all dlas are due to dwarf galaxies , while at @xmath20 , giant galaxies may dominate the population @xcite . hi 21-cm absorption measurements also hint that dwarfs could dominate at high-@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "further work is clearly needed to generate an accurate inventory of dla host galaxy types as a function of cosmic epoch .",
    "nevertheless , the evidence for a broad mix of galaxy types is already compelling , if not conclusive .",
    "it is well established from studies of local galaxies that chemical abundances depend on morphology , luminosity and location within a galaxy .",
    "the diversity and evolution of the dla host population will further complicate and distort estimates of chemical evolution over cosmological timescales .",
    "the dla data themselves thus suggest that we may derive greater insight by attempting to disentangle these different galaxy types of dla absorbers , rather than assuming all dlas can be classified into one sample . a more sensitive test , or at least complementary test , for chemical evolution",
    "may be arrived at if we can select a subset of dlas which arise in a _",
    "narrow range of physical conditions_.    one possibility , which we suggest here , is to target those dlas which exhibit molecular hydrogen absorption .",
    "there are currently 8 examples of such h@xmath1-bearing dlas at redshifts @xmath22 .",
    "none of the absorbing galaxies have been identified directly through imaging , though hints at the galaxy types come from a comparison with our own galaxy and its satellites .",
    "the mean molecular hydrogen fraction , @xmath23hi@xmath24 $ ] , seen along lines of sight through our the galaxy is @xmath25 , and for the smc and lmc it is @xmath26 .",
    "dla detections lie in the range from @xmath27 ( upper limits on non - detections are @xmath28 , @xcite , hereafter lps03 ) but 2/3 of the detections are in the range @xmath29 . as discussed in , @xmath3090% of the sightlines through our galaxy ( and through the smc ) intercept h@xmath1 clouds . for the lmc ,",

    "using kendall s @xmath11 as a non - parametric correlation estimate gives @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    "the slope , @xmath65 , also compares well with that derived by @xcite for the overall 125 dla sample , i.e.  @xmath66 .",
    "visually , the [ m / h]@xmath10 distribution suggests two further results : ( i ) as discussed in @xcite , the h@xmath1-bearing dlas have systematically higher [ m / h ] than the general dla population . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks )",
    "test reveals the two [ m / h ] distributions to have only 2% probability of being drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "removing the lowest and highest redshift h@xmath1-bearing dlas , which are also the extreme [ m / h ] points , would give good agreement between the slope for the remaining 6 points and the general dla population , but the metallicity agreement would be somewhat worse ( ks probability reduces to 0.8% ) .",
    "( ii ) the [ m / h]@xmath10 correlation appears to be tighter for the h@xmath1-bearing dlas compared to the general dla population . to test this",
    "we subtract the linear fit to the data in each case and use an f - test to compare the variances of the residuals .",
    "the variance for the 60 general dlas is 1.9 times that for the h@xmath1-bearing dlas , although the probability of this happening by chance is 39% given the sample sizes .    in summary",
    ", the h@xmath1-bearing dlas display a faster increase in metallicity with cosmic time compared to the general dla population .",
    "furthermore , this increase is more well - defined in the h@xmath1-bearing sample and these dlas seem to be chemically distinct from the general dla population .    . ]",
    "these latter two results are also supported by the distribution of relative iron abundances , [ fe / h ] , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . using [ fe / h ] for the same 60 general dlas from @xcite as before , the ks probability for the two samples being drawn from the same parent distribution is only 0.01% .",
    "the f - test reveals that the variance of the general dla population is 2.1 times that of the h@xmath1-bearing sample but , again , this has reasonably low statistical significance since we would expect a larger variance ratio 29% of the time by chance alone .",
    "therefore , the h@xmath1-bearing dlas do seem to form a chemically distinct sub - class of the dla population which may encompass a narrower range of physical conditions and environments .",
    "we note in passing that the slope of the [ fe / h]@xmath67 relation for the h@xmath1-bearing dlas , in contrast to the [ m / h]@xmath10 relation , is not significantly steeper than for the general dla population . with the same fitting procedure above we find @xmath68 and the slope @xmath69 with kendall s @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the h@xmath1-bearing dlas .",
    "the general dla population gives @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "these shallower slopes are expected if dust depletion increases in importance with decreasing redshift , as implied by the @xmath46@xmath10 relation discussed below ( section 3.3 ) .",
    "we explicitly treat the evolution of the dust depletion factor in @xcite .",
    "finally , it was earlier mentioned that the above conclusions rely relatively heavily on the highest redshift h@xmath1 detection towards 0000@xmath32263 .",
    "if we remove this point , the straight - line fits to the [ m / h]@xmath10 relation give @xmath76 and the slope @xmath77 with a non - parametric correlation estimate given by kendall s @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the negative [ m / h]@xmath10 correlation is not as steep , nor as robust when the 0000@xmath32263 data point is removed .",
    "however , note that the evidence supporting the hypothesis that the h@xmath1-bearing dlas form a chemically distinct population with a potentially narrower range of physical conditions is relatively independent of the 0000@xmath32263 h@xmath1 detection . comparing the 7",
    "remaining h@xmath1-bearing dlas with the 49 general dlas between @xmath80 from @xcite gives a ks probability of @xmath81 and the f - test gives a ratio of variances of 2.6 which occurs 23% of the time by chance alone .",
    "turning to the lower panel of fig.1 , we proceed as above and derive a straight - line fit for the @xmath46@xmath10 relation : @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "kendall s @xmath11 is @xmath84 with @xmath60 .",
    "thus , there is reasonable statistical evidence that the molecular hydrogen fraction increases dramatically with cosmic time .",
    "previous studies do not explicitly identify this trend .",
    "in particular , although plot @xmath46 versus @xmath10 for their sample of dlas ( their figure 16 ) they do not point out this apparently rapid evolution of @xmath46 with @xmath10 .",
    "again , removing 0000@xmath32263 from consideration weakens the statistical significance of the @xmath46@xmath10 correlation but the slope remains quite steep : the new fits with 0000@xmath32263 removed give @xmath85 , @xmath86 with kendall s @xmath78 and @xmath87 .",
    "however , we again stress the apparent reliability of the h@xmath1 detection towards 0000@xmath32263 made by @xcite and point out that h@xmath1 systems with high-@xmath10 and high-@xmath46 ( or , indeed , low-@xmath10 and low-@xmath46 ) will need to be detected to show this correlation to be spurious .",
    "below we consider possible interpretations of the @xmath46@xmath10 trend but first discuss some systematic effects and biases .",
    "could the strikingly steep apparent evolution of @xmath46 with @xmath10 be significantly affected by observational selection effects ?",
    "we consider some possibilities for both the [ m / h] and @xmath46@xmath10 correlations below .",
    "firstly , the h@xmath1 sample is inhomogeneous since the quasar spectra do not all have similar s / n and since the h@xmath1 detection methods and criteria were not uniform .",
    "indeed , the weak h@xmath1 lines detected towards 0000@xmath32263 and 0347@xmath32383 are at the same level as the many non - detections listed by ( their figure 16 ) .",
    "typically , these fall in the region illustrated in fig .  1 by the light dot - dash line .",
    "the @xmath46@xmath67 correlation we report is therefore only tentative .",
    "however , it seems surprising that no high-@xmath10/high-@xmath46 or low-@xmath10/low-@xmath46 detections of h@xmath1 have been made .",
    "secondly , the h@xmath1 detection limit will change with redshift : observed line widths increase as @xmath88 , making higher-@xmath21 lines more detectable , but the lyman-@xmath0 forest density increases roughly as @xmath89 , making higher-@xmath21 lines harder to detect due to increased blending .",
    "this will be further complicated by higher order lyman series forest lines for dlas at low redshift compared to their corresponding qso .",
    "quantification of these competing effects requires numerical simulations which mimic the ( unknown and , likely , non - uniform ) techniques used to detect the 8 h@xmath1 systems studied in fig.1 .",
    "the [ m / h ] and @xmath46 values in fig.1 are not specific to the h@xmath1-bearing components because @xmath4hi@xmath8 is determined from the damped lyman-@xmath0 line profile .",
    "the relative abundances of refractory ( e.g.  fe ) and non - refractory ( e.g.  si ) elements are generally found to be uniform across the absorption profiles of most dlas @xcite , indicating that [ m / h ] is also likely to be uniform . the notable exceptions to this rule are the h@xmath1-bearing components where large dust depletion factors are found ( e.g.  lps03 and the [ si / fe ] profile of 0347@xmath32383 in @xcite ) .",
    "these components usually dominate the non - refractory metal - line profiles and so , although the derived [ m / h ] and @xmath46 measurements will be systematically underestimated , the effect will not be large .",
    "though the fitted slopes in fig.1 are likely to be reasonably robust against this effect , a larger sample and more detailed study of the metal - line and lyman series profiles is required .",
    "selection effects related to dust obscuration of quasars may also be present . in the h@xmath1 systems , @xmath46 is somewhat correlated with dust depletion factor [ zn / fe ] , providing evidence that the h@xmath1 is formed on dust grains , a view supported by theory ( @xcite , cf .",
    "however , dlas containing large amounts of dust ( i.e.  those with high @xmath46 ) could suppress detection of their background quasars and may therefore be ` missing ' from our sample @xcite .",
    "since metallicity and dust depletion are also strongly correlated , this effect is likely to suppress , rather than create , the correlations in fig.1 .",
    "further to this , @xcite and @xcite found an anti - correlation between [ zn / h ] and @xmath4hi@xmath8 in dlas .",
    "for the 8 h@xmath1 systems studied here , there exists a mild correlation between @xmath4hi@xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "if the latter is not simply fortuitous , it should have resulted in a correlation between @xmath46 and @xmath10 , opposite to that observed .",
    "the above implies that dust obscuration bias may somewhat _ suppress _ the observed @xmath46@xmath10 correlation .",
    "however , several empirical studies suggest this bias is small . for example",
    ", dla surveys using radio - selected quasars should not be subject to this bias .",
    "recent work @xcite indicates that the number of dlas per unit redshift interval found in previous optical dla surveys is not significantly biased , suggesting the number of ` missing ' dlas is at most a factor of 2 below the radio - selected result .",
    "nevertheless , we note 2 studies which tentatively suggest strong enhancements in the incidence of absorption towards radio - loud bl lac objects @xcite and optically red quasars @xcite . in the former case , many of the emission redshifts are not known and so , if intrinsic absorption occurs more frequently in bl lacs , the comparison with @xcite is not useful . for the red quasars of @xcite ,",
    "only absorption close to the quasar redshifts was searched for and so , again , the comparison with @xcite is tentative . clearly these possible discrepancies should be resolved observationally in future work .",
    "by selecting those dlas exhibiting h@xmath1 absorption , one may focus on systems with a narrower range of physical conditions than the general dla population .",
    "tentative support for this conjecture lies in the tighter metallicity@xmath10 anti - correlation observed for the 8 h@xmath1 dlas studied here .",
    "@xcite recently presented detailed chemical evolution models which give a slope for the metallicity@xmath10 relation of @xmath90 .",
    "they correct this predicted slope for various observational biases to achieve the shallower slope observed for the general dla population .",
    "however , the steep slope observed for 8 h@xmath1 systems may be less affected by these biases and may therefore be more comparable to the uncorrected model slopes .",
    "h@xmath1-bearing dlas could therefore provide an important probe of cosmological chemical evolution .",
    "that there exists such a large range ( @xmath50 ) in the values of @xmath46 in fig.1 may not be surprising .",
    "for example , @xcite describes a photo - ionization model for clouds in local hydrostatic equilibrium with a representative incident uv background flux , [ m / h ] and dust - to - metals ratio .",
    "the molecular fraction in this model shows a sudden increase of @xmath91 for only a small increase in the total hydrogen density .",
    "therefore , the very steep @xmath46@xmath10 correlation in fig.1 could be achieved with a modest increase in dust content at lower redshifts , consistent with the [ m / h]@xmath10 correlation . within the schaye model",
    ", one also expects an anti - correlation between the intensity of the uv background and @xmath46 .",
    "however , the behaviour of the uv background flux with redshift over the range @xmath923 is still a matter of considerable uncertainty .",
    "the strong decrease in @xmath46 at high @xmath10 may also be consistent with recent hi 21-cm absorption measurements in dlas @xcite , where a generally higher spin temperature is found at @xmath93 . with an increased sample size and more detailed analyses , the @xmath46@xmath10 correlation ,",
    "if real , may provide complementary constraints on these problems .",
