    "a magnetic field applied to a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system changes both the orbital and spin dynamics of the carriers .",
    "a crucial aspect of this dynamics is spin relaxation , which arises due to spin - orbit ( so ) coupling .",
    "this coupling is well - described in zincblende ( 001)-grown structures by a hamiltonian @xmath3 that is the sum of two terms , a rashba hamiltonian @xcite @xmath4 and a dresselhaus hamiltonian@xcite @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are coupling constants , @xmath8 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the electron charge , and @xmath11 is a vector - potential of the external field ; @xmath12 and @xmath13 arise , respectively , due to the artificial macroscopic asymmetry of the structure , and due to the microscopic inversion asymmetry of the zincblende unit cell .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath14 and @xmath7 typically range from 10@xmath15 to 10@xmath16 evcm .",
    "@xcite    the spin relaxation of conducting electrons is usually described using a dyakonov - perel @xcite approach , where it is assumed that the orientation of the spin precession axis changes randomly through scattering by impurities . in the absence of an external magnetic field",
    "the spin relaxation rate is @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the momentum relaxation time , and where @xmath19 depends on @xmath6 and @xmath20 since spin relaxation arises due to the random spatial motion of the electron , the orbital effect of a magnetic field , which can restrict the region over which an electron can sample the effect of impurities , influences the spin relaxation . at @xmath21 the relaxation rate decreases by a factor@xcite of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the cyclotron frequency for a magnetic field @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being the electron effective mass .",
    "in such a strong field the electron path becomes close to a circle , with scattering effects negligible . on this orbit the mean spin precession angle",
    "vanishes due to the fact that the electron velocity @xmath26 , and , therefore , the randomness in the precession is suppressed . for a random",
    "so coupling a non - quantizing magnetic field can , however , speed up spin relaxation and make the relaxation process gaussian rather than exponential in its time dependence.@xcite the @xmath27dependence of the relaxation rate in nonquantizing fields can demonstrate magnetoquantum oscillations , as shown by self - consistent born approximation for 2d electron gas in a short - range potential of impurities.@xcite analysis of spin relaxation in weak magnetic fields allows the extraction of so coupling parameters from experimental data.@xcite    studies of spin dynamics of itinerant electrons typically assume that their motion can be described semiclassically . however , spin dynamics of carriers with quantized lateral motion is of interest both for understanding of the fundamental physics of spin transport @xcite and for applications of nanosize systems in spintronics .",
    "an interesting example of a system with quantum lateral motion is 2d electron gas in a strong magnetic field , where landau states must be used to represent the electrons and only a few ( or a fraction ) of the landau levels is occupied .",
    "an analogous regime has been widely discussed for quantum dots , where electrons are confined by an external potential . there",
    "the so coupling mixes states with opposite spins , making spin - flip transitions accompanied by phonon emission possible.@xcite here we are interested in itinerant two - dimensional electrons , where early experimental data has shown the suppression of spin relaxation in strong magnetic fields.@xcite the treatment of 2d electrons in quantizing fields is rather subtle,@xcite with different theoretical techniques giving different results even for static properties such as the density of states .",
    "the analytical approaches require approximations that might be not widely applicable .",
    "the situation becomes even more complicated for the response functions , such as those describing charge and spin currents , as well as relaxation processes .",
    "an analytical study by bastard @xcite of spin relaxation in the self - consistent born approximation , for a short - range random potential and a small electron @xmath2-factor , where the zeeman splitting is small in comparison with the level broadening , showed that both spin - orbit coupling and disorder play a role , and allowed an estimation of the relaxation rate .    here",
    "we perform a numerical study of the problem using the exact diagonalization technique for a large but finite - size system , and show the diverse physical mechanisms that contribute to the relaxation process .",
    "this approach has proven its applicability in calculations of the spin - hall conductivity of a disordered 2d electron gas,@xcite where the spectrum and the full set of eigenstates are required for the calculation .",
    "we consider a quantum well in a magnetic field parallel to the growth direction , @xmath28 .",
    "the field forms spin - split landau levels , inhomogeneously broadened by the disorder . in undoped quantum wells",
    "the random potential arises due to the monolayer islands of the parent compounds at the interfaces ( thickness fluctuations ) and due to the content variations near the interfaces.@xcite the island patterns depend on the growth conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian for an electron in an undoped quantum well with disorder is @xmath29 where the random contribution @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the position of a defect . as a model",
    ", we consider the gaussian potential @xmath32 with the areal density of defects @xmath33 and a correlation function @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the average areal density of defects . to avoid the uniform shift of the landau levels , we assume that @xmath36 @xmath37 varies from site to site",
    ", being either positive or negative such that the mean value @xmath38 the correlation function of the random potential is @xmath39 , where @xcite @xmath40    at @xmath41 the momentum relaxation time in this model is given by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the electron wavelength .",
    "the result for the @xmath44 case is valid in the born approximation for scattering by well - separated impurities;@xcite in the opposite limit the electron is moving semiclassically in a smooth potential , where @xmath45 depends on the electron energy.@xcite    to describe the magnetic field , we choose the landau gauge @xmath46 where the eigenstates @xmath47 of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath48 are represented by the spinors : @xmath49 h_{n}\\left ( \\frac{x_{k}}{l_{b}}\\right ) \\beta _ { s},\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the spinor corresponding to one of the states @xmath51,@xmath52 , @xmath53 is the landau level number , the magnetic length @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the center of the oscillator wavefunction , @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 is the @xmath60axis size of the system and @xmath61 is the @xmath53th hermite polynomial .",
    "the corresponding unperturbed spectrum is @xmath62 due to the selection rules for the matrix elements of @xmath63 and spin components @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the so coupling only connects states of opposite spins from nearest landau levels.@xcite this results in a small shift in the energies of the order of @xmath66 .",
    "the matrix elements of the disorder hamiltonian diagonal over the spin index are given by : @xmath67 and couple states in all landau levels for which @xmath68 and , correspondingly @xmath69 , thus leading to electron localization both in the @xmath70 and @xmath60directions . as a result the density of eigenstates with energies @xmath71 has the form of broadened landau levels , typically ( at @xmath72 t ) with the width @xmath73 on the order of or less than 1 mev , at least an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath74 .",
    "the corresponding eigenfunctions are expressed as linear combinations :    @xmath75    with complex coefficients @xmath76 .",
    "only a few of the amplitudes @xmath76 are nonnegligible , since @xmath77 couples only the states with close momenta @xmath78 due to the combined effect of disorder and so coupling , the @xmath79 and @xmath80 states within one landau level become coupled as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , thus introducing randomness in the spin precession at the frequency scale @xmath81 , and , in turn , spin relaxation .",
    "we consider an electron - hole plasma injected by a light pulse in an undoped quantum well ( fig.1(b ) ) .",
    "we assume that the plasma density is small , and neglect all many - body effects . alternatively , for a doped quantum well , we assume the carriers are injected into unoccupied landau states above the fermi level .",
    "we concentrate on the spin relaxation of electrons , since the hole spins relax much faster.@xcite    we assume that the spectral width of the exciting light @xmath82 satisfies the conditions @xmath83 as shown in fig.1(b ) .",
    "therefore , the states @xmath84 ( index @xmath85 numerates the injected electrons , with their total number being @xmath86 ) in which the electrons are injected can be written as superposition of the @xmath87 states from essentially one landau level @xmath88 and spin projection @xmath89 determined by the light polarization.@xcite within this approximation a unitary transformation connects the full sets of @xmath84 and @xmath90 states .",
    "thus , in place of averaging the time - dependent spin components over @xmath91 , we can average over the @xmath92 as follows : @xmath93 this relaxation is coherent in the sense that the total energy @xmath94 of the injected electrons is conserved on the timescale considered here and is not transformed into lattice phonons or low - energy electron excitations .    to evaluate @xmath95 numerically , we have to find the spinor representation of the @xmath96 ; that is , we must determine the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath97 in eq.(1 ) .",
    "to do this , we have chosen a basis of @xmath98 states per landau level for each spin projection .",
    "the total hilbert space included @xmath99 landau levels , which we find sufficient for our choice of the parameters given below , for which @xmath100 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath101 considered as the elements of the eigenvectors are arranged in the following order : @xmath102 where in every subset @xmath103 is running from 0 to @xmath104",
    "for sample calculation we consider two types of typical structures .",
    "the first is a symmetric quantum well with electrons located in a gaas layer , with the dresselhaus so coupling @xmath105 evcm , @xmath106 ( @xmath107 is the free electron mass ) , and @xmath108 .",
    "the other is an asymmetric structure with the electrons located in a in@xmath109ga@xmath109as layer , with@xcite a rashba so coupling @xmath110 evcm , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "we assume that both of them have a width of 10 nm .",
    "for these structures the ratio of effective masses @xmath113 , while the electron @xmath114factors are different approximately by a factor of @xmath115 .",
    "it is the difference in @xmath2-factors that will lead to large quantitative difference between the spin relaxation in these two structures .    as a realization of the disorder@xcite we consider a short - range potential with @xmath116 mev for gaas and @xmath117 mev for @xmath118 structure , @xmath119 nm , and @xmath120 @xmath121 .",
    "these parameters can describe the random potential arising due to the single unit cell layer thickness variations in quantum wells of the width of 10 nm . since @xmath122 ,",
    "the width of the landau level @xmath123 does not depend on the level number .",
    "we also consider a long - range potential with @xmath124 nm and the same amplitudes @xmath125 as for the short - range one .",
    "both these random potentials lead to mobilities of @xmath126 @xmath127vs at concentrations of electrons @xmath128 @xmath121 in both structures . note that in the case of a long - range potential @xmath129 , we have @xmath130 .",
    "this spatial scale can be achieved by quantum well fabrication with growth interruption @xcite , or by remote doping on the quantum well sides .",
    "the results of numerical calculations for the gaas quantum well are presented in figs . 2 and 3 for different initial spin components @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively , two different types of disorder , and magnetic fields of 4 t and 8 t. in these gaas - based structures we find the relaxation times on the order of 100 ps , of the same order of magnitude for out - of - plane @xmath133 and in - plane @xmath134 spin components .",
    "they relax on the same time scale since the same mechanism , that is the random spin precession , leads to the relaxation in both spin polarizations . with the increase of the landau level number",
    ", the electron motion becomes less sensitive to the disorder , and the spin relaxation time increases , as demonstrated by the results for @xmath135 in fig . 2 and fig.3 .",
    "this corresponds well to the experimental results of sih _",
    "et al._@xcite spin relaxation due to acoustic phonon emission @xcite occurs at a much longer time scale , and is not considered here .",
    "an interesting effect is the spin precession in the @xmath136 relaxation , clearly seen in our calculations .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction couples zeeman - split landau levels which are broadened due to disorder , and so the @xmath137-component of the spin is not a constant of motion .",
    "for this reason , the initially prepared @xmath138 states precess with the frequencies in the range determined by the zeeman splitting and the landau level width , distributed over interval of the width @xmath81 centered at @xmath139 .",
    "the precession amplitude is smeared with time due to spin relaxation , as seen in our results .",
    "4 presents the results for in@xmath109ga@xmath109as structure , where the spin relaxation is much slower . due to",
    "the increased zeeman splitting the frequency of the spin oscillations here is considerably larger than that in the gaas quantum well , and the oscillations become more well - defined .",
    "the role of the zeeman splitting @xmath140 in spin relaxation , clearly seen when one compares the results for the gaas and in@xmath109ga@xmath109as structures , is crucial to the mechanism of the spin relaxation , and can be understood as follows.@xcite the random potential accompanied by so coupling leads to the spin - flip transitions .",
    "however , only spatially close states ( with a large overlap ) with opposite spins can contribute effectively to the spin relaxation .",
    "on the other hand , the spin - flip process should conserve energy , and , therefore , a lateral distance @xmath141 on which the orbital has to be displaced to find its spin - flip partner state depends on the zeeman splitting . to understand the effect we evaluate the fluctuation of the expectation value of energy for a state described by wave function @xmath142 :    @xmath143^{2 } \\right\\rangle \\\\ \\nonumber & = & 2\\langle u^{2}\\rangle \\int f_{c}(\\bm{\\rho}_{1}-\\bm{\\rho}_{2 } ) \\psi^{2}\\left(\\bm{\\rho}_{1}\\right ) \\left [ \\psi^{2}\\left(\\bm{\\rho } _",
    "{ 2}\\right)- \\psi^{2}\\left(\\bm{\\rho}_{2}+\\bm{\\rho}\\right )   \\right ]   d^{2}\\rho_{1}d^{2}\\rho_{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this fluctuation can be calculated in two limiting cases as : @xmath144 , \\quad l_{b}\\gg r_{g } , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where we assumed for an estimate that for the ground orbital state @xmath145 if @xmath141 determined by energy conservation is less than @xmath146 that is @xmath147 the relaxation occurs effectively . in the opposite case , the decay time increases due to a small spatial overlap of the initial and final states . in other words , if @xmath148 the spin relaxation is suppressed , since the energy conservation can not be fulfilled in the spin - flip process . in this case",
    "the @xmath137-component of spin relaxes from the initial value by approximately @xmath149 , and then the system has to pass by emitting acoustic phonons through a phonon bottleneck @xcite for the spin to relax it further .",
    "this `` spin - flip distance '' argument explains the difference between the spin relaxation for a `` long '' and `` short''- range potentials shown in fig .",
    "4 . in both cases",
    "the amplitude of the potential fluctuations is the same , but in the case of a long - range potential the electron must be displaced a longer distance to find its spin - flip partner state .",
    "thus , the relaxation rate decreases with the increase of the correlation length @xmath150 , in agreement with results presented in fig.4 .",
    "to conclude , we investigated the spin relaxation in quantizing magnetic fields in a disordered 2d electron gas , and found that the result depends on the landau level number , and that the process is accompanied by spin oscillations .",
    "the mechanism discussed here is different from the usual dyakonov - perel mechanism , and is closer in nature to the elliot - yafet mechanism , in which the spin relaxation rate increases with the disorder.@xcite the relaxation rate depends on the details of the potential and electron @xmath114factor , and can not be understood solely in terms of the electron mobility .",
    "the results obtained can be used to characterize the disorder in undoped quantum wells .",
    "such disorder is typically probed experimentally by studying the inhomogeneous broadening of the spectra of excitons , a technique restricted either to the spatial scale given by the exciton bohr radius or by the exciton localization length.@xcite neither of these lengths can be changed externally in a well - controlled way .",
    "the advantage of studying the spin relaxation in a magnetic field is that it allows probing different spatial scales of disorder by controllably changing the length @xmath151 trough varying the magnetic field .    _ acknowledgment .",
