    "it was found many years ago that the bardeen - cooper - shriffer ( bcs ) superfluidity / superconductivity in degenerate fermi gas and the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of composite molecules can be smoothly connected when eagles and leggett found that the ground state wave functions of bcs and bec states are essentially the same@xcite .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover phenomena can be realized in high temperature superconductivity and atomic fermi gas where the s - wave scattering length can be adjusted@xcite .",
    "recently , the study on bcs - bec crossover has been extended to relativistic fermi systems with the nozieres - schmitt - rink ( nsr ) theory@xcite and the bose - fermi model@xcite . in the nsr theory above the critical temperature , a new feature of bcs - bec crossover is found : there exist two kinds of bec states@xcite , the non - relativistic bec ( nbec ) and the relativistic bec ( rbec ) . in the rbec state ,",
    "the condensed bosons become nearly massless , anti - matter can be excited , and matter and anti - matter are nearly degenerate .",
    "a natural question is : does the rbec appear only in relativistic systems and never exist in non - relativistic systems ? in this paper , we will argue that the rbec phase can happen in any system if the attractive coupling is large enough , even though the system is initially in non - relativistic state . from text books@xcite , when the fermi momentum of a system is much smaller than the fermion mass , we can treat the system non - relativistically .",
    "this statement is true only if the coupling is weak enough . for sufficiently strong coupling",
    ", the system will become relativistic even though the fermi momentum is much smaller than the fermion mass .",
    "we will extend in this paper the theory of bcs - bec crossover in symmetry breaking state@xcite at zero temperature to relativistic systems .",
    "the requirement for such an extension is that we should recover the non - relativistic theory in a proper limit .",
    "we will focus on two relativistic effects : the anti - fermion degrees of freedom and the nontrivial fermion mass .",
    "the first effect leads to the appearance of the rbec state at sufficiently strong coupling , and the second effect breaks the universality of bcs - bec crossover .",
    "we will also investigate the collective modes evolution in the bcs - bec crossover .",
    "the physical motivation why we need a relativistic theory of bcs - bec crossover is mostly due to the study of qcd phase diagram , especially the dense quark matter which may exist in compact stars and can be created in heavy ion collisions .",
    "however , we will point out that the theory is also necessary for non - relativistic systems when the coupling is strong enough . to this end , let us first review the non - relativistic theory of bcs - bec crossover in a dilute fermi gas .",
    "leggett s mean field theory@xcite is successful to describe the non - relativistic bcs - bec crossover at zero temperature . for a dilute fermi gas with fixed density @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the fermi momentum ,",
    "the bcs - bec crossover can be found if one self - consistently solves the gap and number equations for the pairing gap @xmath2 and the fermion chemical potential @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are defined as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the s - wave scattering length .",
    "the fermion mass @xmath10 plays a trivial role here , since the bcs - bec crossover depends only on the dimensionless parameter @xmath11 , which is the so - called universality for non - relativistic syetems .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover can be characterized by the chemical potential @xmath3 : it coincides with the fermi energy @xmath12 in the bcs limit @xmath13 but becomes negative in the bec region . in the bec limit @xmath14",
    ", one has @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the molecular binding energy . therefore ,",
    "in the non - relativistic theory the chemical potential will tend to be negatively infinity in the bec limit .",
    "a problem arises if we look into the physics of the bec limit from a relativistic point of view . in the relativistic description ,",
    "the fermion dispersion becomes @xmath17 , where @xmath18 correspond to fermion and anti - fermion degrees of freedom , and @xmath19 is the chemical potential in relativistic theory@xcite . in the non - relativistic limit @xmath20 ,",
    "if @xmath19 is of the order of @xmath10 , we can neglect the anti - fermion degrees of freedom and recover the non - relativistic dispersion @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , not @xmath19 itself but the quantity @xmath22 plays the role of non - relativistic chemical potential @xmath3@xcite . while the chemical potential @xmath3 can be arbitrarily negative in non - relativistic theory , @xmath19 is under some physical constraint in relativistic theory . since the molecule binding energy",
    "can not be larger than two times the constituent mass , the absolute value of the non - relativistic chemical potential @xmath23 at strong enough coupling can not exceed the fermion mass @xmath10 , and the relativistic chemical potential @xmath19 should be always positive . if the number density @xmath24 satisfies @xmath25 , the non - relativistic theory works well when the coupling is not very strong and the binding energy satisfies @xmath26 .",
    "however , if the coupling is strong enough to ensure @xmath27 , relativistic effects will appear . from @xmath28",
    ", we can roughly estimate that the non - relativistic theory becomes unphysical for the s - wave scattering length @xmath29 .",
    "this can be understood if we consider @xmath30 as the compton wavelength @xmath31 of a particle .",
    "what will then happen at @xmath14 in an attractive fermi gas ?",
    "at sufficiently strong coupling with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the dispersions @xmath34 and @xmath35 for fermions and anti - fermions become nearly degenerate , and non - relativistic limit can not be reached even for systems with @xmath25 .",
    "this means that the anti - fermion pairs can be excited and become nearly degenerate with the fermion pairs , and the condensed bosons and anti - bosons become nearly massless . without any model dependent calculation , we can confirm an important relativistic effect in bcs - bec crossover : there should exist a relativistic bec(rbec ) state@xcite which is smoothly connected to the non - relativistic bec(nbec ) state .",
    "the rbec is not a specific phenomenon for relativistic fermion systems , it should appear in any fermion system if the attractive coupling becomes strong enough , even though the initial non - interacting gas satisfies @xmath25 .",
    "we now start to construct a general relativistic model , which we expect to recover the non - relativistic theory in a proper limit .",
    "we consider only fermion degrees of freedom in the original lagrangian .",
    "the most general form of the lagrangian density can be expressed as @xmath36 where @xmath37 denote the dirac fields with mass @xmath10 , and @xmath38 describes the attractive interaction among the fermions .",
    "it is shown that the dominant interaction is in the scalar channel @xmath39@xcite .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we consider the zero range interaction and take the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the attractive coupling constant , and @xmath42 is the charge conjugation matrix . generally , by increasing the attractive coupling , the crossover from condensation of spin - zero cooper pairs at weak coupling to the bose - einstein condensation of bound bosons at strong coupling can be realized .",
    "we start our calculation from the partition function in imaginary time formalism , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the inverse temperature , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the chemical potential corresponding to the net charge density @xmath47 which is determined by the charge conservation .",
    "similar to the method in the study of superconductivity , we introduce the nambu - gorkov spinors @xmath48 and the auxiliary pair field @xmath49 , and then perform the hubbard - stratonovich transformation , the partition function can be written as @xmath50 in terms of the inverse nambu - gorkov propagator @xmath51 where @xmath52 are defined in nambu - gorkov space with @xmath53 being the pauli matrices . integrating out the fermion fields",
    ", we finally derive the partition function @xmath54 with the bosonic effective action @xmath55\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while in general case one should include the contribution from pair fluctuations@xcite , the leggett mean field theory is already good to describe the bcs - bec crossover at zero temperature .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that , the dominant contribution of fluctuations to the thermodynamic potential at low temperature is from the massless goldstone modes and is proportional to @xmath56 . at zero temperature it vanishes@xcite .",
    "while the mean field theory can describe well the bcs - bec crossover , it can not predict precise values of the universal constants in the unitary limit and the boson - boson scattering length in the bec limit . since our goal in this paper is to investigate the bcs - bec crossover only",
    ", we will take the mean field approximation in the following .",
    "in the mean field approximation , we consider the uniform and static saddle point @xmath57 which satisfies the stationary condition @xmath58/\\delta \\delta_0=0 $ ] .",
    "the thermodynamic potential density @xmath59/(\\beta v)$ ] at the saddle point can be evaluated as @xmath60 where we have defined the notations @xmath61 and @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "minimizing @xmath64 , we get the gap equation for the condensate @xmath2 , @xmath65 and the number equation for the fermion density @xmath0 , @xmath66.\\ ] ] the first and second terms on the right hand side of equations ( [ gap ] ) and ( [ number ] ) correspond to fermion and anti - fermion degrees of freedom , respectively .",
    "the model is non - renormalizable and a proper regularization is needed .",
    "we subtract the vacuum contribution @xmath67 from the gap equation , namely we replace the bare coupling @xmath41 by a renormalized coupling @xmath68 , @xmath69 to recover the non - relativistic theory correctly , the chemical potential in vacuum should be chosen as @xmath70 rather than @xmath71 .",
    "such a subtraction is consistent with the formula derived from the two body scattering matrix@xcite .",
    "the effective s - wave scattering length @xmath9 can be defined as @xmath72 . while this is a natural extension of the regularization in non - relativistic theory ,",
    "the ultraviolet divergence can not be completely removed , and a momentum cutoff @xmath73 still exists in the theory .",
    "the relativistic fermi energy @xmath74 in the theory can be define as @xmath75 , which recovers the fermi kinetic energy @xmath76 in non - relativistic limit .",
    "in the non - relativistic theory , there are only two characteristic lengths @xmath77 and @xmath9 , and the bcs - bec crossover shows the universality : after a proper scaling , all physical quantities depend only on the dimensionless coupling @xmath78 .",
    "especially , in the unitary limit @xmath79 , all scaled physical quantities become universal constants . unlike the non - relativistic theory where the fermion mass @xmath10 plays a trivial role , in the relativistic theory a new length scale , namely the compton wavelength @xmath80 appears .",
    "as a consequence , the bcs - bec crossover should depend on not only the dimensionless coupling @xmath81 , but also the quantity @xmath82 .",
    "since the cutoff @xmath73 is needed , there is also a @xmath83 dependence . by scaling all energies by @xmath84 and momenta by @xmath1 ,",
    "the gap and number equations ( [ gap ] ) and ( [ number ] ) become dimensionless , @xmath85,\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{2}{3}&=&\\int_0^zx^2dx\\bigg[\\left(1-\\frac{\\xi_x^-}{e_x^-}\\right)-\\left(1-\\frac{\\xi_x^+}{e_x^+}\\right)\\bigg]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the definitions @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "it becomes now clear that the bcs - bec crossover is characterized by three dimensionless parameters , @xmath90 and @xmath83 .",
    "we now study when we can recover the non - relativistic theory in the limit @xmath91 .",
    "expanding @xmath92 in powers of @xmath93 , @xmath94 , we can recover the non - relativistic version of @xmath95 .",
    "however , we can not simply neglect the terms corresponding to anti - fermions , namely the second terms on the right hand side of equations ( [ scale ] ) .",
    "such terms can be neglected only when @xmath96 and @xmath2 are both much less than @xmath10 .",
    "when the coupling is so strong to ensure @xmath97 , the contribution from anti - fermions becomes significant . in this case",
    "the condition @xmath98 is not sufficient to describe the non - relativistic limit , and the other important condition should be @xmath99 which guarantees the molecule binding energy @xmath26 . with the dimensionless coupling @xmath81 , we have @xmath100 . therefore , the complete condition for the non - relativistic limit can be expressed as @xmath98 and @xmath101 .    to confirm the above statement we solve the gap and number equations numerically . in fig.[fig1 ] we show the condensate @xmath2 and non - relativistic chemical potential @xmath102 as functions of @xmath81 in the region @xmath103 for several values of @xmath104 . in this region",
    "the cutoff dependence is weak and can be neglected . for sufficiently small @xmath93 , we really recover the leggett result . with increasing @xmath93 ,",
    "however , the universality is broken and the deviation becomes more and more remarkable . on the other hand ,",
    "when we increase the coupling @xmath81 , especially for @xmath105 , the difference between our calculation at any fixed @xmath93 and the leggett result becomes significant due to relativistic effects .",
    "this means that even in the case @xmath98 we can not recover the non - relativistic result when the coupling @xmath81 is of the order of @xmath106 .",
    "this can be seen clearly from the @xmath81 dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath46 in a wider @xmath81 region , shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "we found in our numerical calculation with the cutoff @xmath107 a critical coupling @xmath108 which is consistent with the above estimation . beyond this point",
