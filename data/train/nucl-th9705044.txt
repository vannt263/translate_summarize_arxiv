    "remarkably , the mean field provides a good description of many systems",
    ". the underlying dynamics may be very different , the interparticle interaction may be long range or short range ; it may be weak or strong .",
    "nevertheless in each case a mean field description agrees closely with experiment .",
    "the question naturally arises : what are the common features which these various systems have which ensure the effectiveness of the mean field approximation ?",
    "this is the issue which mostly concerns us in this paper .",
    "we proceed by presenting a formalism in which the mean field and the error are derived without any reference to a particular dynamical system .",
    "the mean field is obtained as an energy average which smooths over short time events .",
    "this procedure also develops an expression for the error which must be small if the mean field is to be useful . to calculate the error a related assumption is used .",
    "not only is an energy average taken , but it is also assumed that the error matrix elements are random with the consequence that the average error is zero , but of course the average of the square of the error is not . the error can be calculated as a finite series consisting of contributions from various degrees of excitation . a general expression for each term is developed and a parameter determining the relative importance of each term is identified .",
    "it will be noted that the assumptions listed above , namely energy averaging and random error matrix elements , are identical with those used in the statistical theory of nuclear reactions @xcite .",
    "this paper concludes with an exploratory calculation appropriate for the ground state of nuclear matter . only the first order error is considered .",
    "one obtains reasonable estimates of the error .",
    "but importantly there is an enormous reduction in the strength of the residual interaction from that obtained from a fermi gas model which must be a consequence of the statistical approach .",
    "the statistical approach provides a method for calculating the slowly varying and rapidly varying contributions to physical observables .",
    "it differs from the customary approach based on the pauli principle and dynamical correlations .",
    "the latter are a consequence of the rapidly varying contributions .",
    "the theory presented in this paper is essentially a different way of taking these contributions into account .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] the formalism is revisited ,  in particular the partition of the hilbert space into the @xmath1 and @xmath2 sectors ,  and the related equations are discussed , while in sect .",
    "[ sec : energy - average ] a precise definition of the _ energy average _ is provided .",
    "the latter is performed with a distribution , characterized by a single parameter @xmath3 , amounting to shift the position of the poles corresponding to the excited states of the system away from the ground state energy . in the same section",
    ", we pave the way for setting up a suitable formalism to account for the corrections ( the error ) to the mean field energy .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : corrections ] the expression for the corrections to the mean field energy @xmath4 is given in the framework of the expansion , above referred to , built out of successive 2p2h excitations .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : hf ] we deal with the issue of introducing an operator , projecting into a smooth @xmath1-space , simple enough to allow the present approach to be worked out for nuclear matter .",
    "we thus restrict the @xmath1-space ,  also with the aim of rendering transparent the comparison between the mean field energy of the hartree - fock ( hf ) and of the present theory ,  just to a simple state : the hf determinant . with this choice for @xmath1",
    ", we are able to establish an expression connecting the true ground state @xmath5 , the mean field @xmath4 and the hartree - fock @xmath6 energies .",
    "importantly , @xmath4 is shown to be _ always _ lower than @xmath6 and it turns out to be proportional to the variance , to be later defined , of the residual effective interaction @xmath7 among nucleons , which , in our context , is precisely defined .    in sect .  [",
    "sec : spectr - fact ] we address the issue of the occupation probability @xmath8 ( spectroscopic factor ) of the ground state of nuclear matter as defined by the structure of our @xmath1-space .",
    "we are able to deduce , within our scheme , an expression for @xmath8 in terms of @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath6 , and moreover embodying the energy derivative of @xmath7 .    finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : numerical - results ] a scheme which permits numerical predictions of the present approach is developed .    for sake both of simplicity and of illustration , we account for the first corrections only and , even so , we are forced to introduce a free parameter @xmath9 in order to give an estimate of their size .",
    "we are then able to set up two systems of two equations each by coupling the equation for the mean field energy to the one for the fluctuations . by solving the systems and with a convenient choice of the two parameters entering into our approach , namely @xmath3 and @xmath9 , we obtain results consistent with the empirical features of nuclear matter as obtained through an extrapolation from finite nuclei .",
    "we provide at the same time an estimate for the fluctuations of the mean field energy .",
    "these goals are achieved with a residual effective interaction which , as previously emphasized , is lowered by about three orders of magnitude with respect to the bare one and yields a spectroscopic factor not in conflict with other independent estimates @xcite .    in the concluding section our results",
    "are summarized and possible improvements discussed .",
    "in this section we shortly revisit the formalism introduced in ref .",

    "indeed , the dependence upon @xmath5 is non - linear , since the latter appears in the propagator in the @xmath2-space in ( [ fesheqa ] ) .",
    "as emphasized in the introduction , @xmath31 contains both slow and rapidly varying components . to obtain the slowly varying components one must perform an energy average of the wave function .",

    "we shall specify how the energy average is to be carried out .",
    "one introduces a smoothing function @xmath42 with the property @xmath43 the average of a function @xmath44 is then @xmath45 since we are considering bound states we _ require _ the average @xmath46 to be real . a smoothing function which satisfies these conditions is @xmath47 with a path of integration in eq .",

    "( [ sist1 ] ) and ( [ sist2 ] ) .",
    "however the potential which couples @xmath31 and @xmath32 is @xmath54 rather than @xmath55 . the strength of the coupling is thus considerably reduced by roughly @xmath56 which is much less than one .",
    "this assumes that @xmath57 and @xmath58 are of the same order of magnitude .    concerning the parameter @xmath3",
    ", in principle its value should be inferred from experiment ; in practice we shall consider it as a free parameter to be utilized in the search for agreement with experiment .    now",
    "the spectral decomposition of the operator @xmath59 can be performed : @xmath60 where @xmath61 the prime on @xmath62 signify that the lowest eigenfunction @xmath63 is to be excluded .    from eq .",

    "the corrections to the shell model energy @xmath35 are obtained in the statistical formalism as in the case of the nuclear reactions @xcite , by expanding ( [ deltae ] ) in a series of contributions which , rather than by powers of a coupling constant , are identified by the complexity of the states of the @xmath2-space .",

    "actually , because of the essentially two - body nature of the residual interaction @xmath7 , the one effectively responsible for the passage from one set of states to the other , only excitations corresponding to an _ even _ number of particles ( and holes ) are actually filling the sets , as indicated in fig .  [ fig : boxes ] .",
    "the propagation of the system into the @xmath76-th set is then described by the operator @xmath77 , which when @xmath78 reads @xmath79 whereas for @xmath80 obeys the recurrence relation @xmath81 in the above @xmath82 for the sake of illustration each set is sometimes displayed as a box : the order among the sets , which is a condition for the validity of ( [ deltaem ] ) , can then be expressed by stating that no box can be occupied unless the previous one has already been too ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : boxes ] ) .",
    "moreover , it should be noticed that in a nucleus the expansion ( [ deltaeexp ] ) is finite since the excited states with the greatest complexity correspond to the case @xmath83 , @xmath84 being the mass number .    since the mean field contains the average , the average of the corrections to the mean field vanishes .",
    "in addition because of the random nature of the processes occurring beyond the mean field the average of the corrections to the shell model stemming from any individual set vanishes as well .",
    "thus @xmath85 and @xmath86 however the average of the square of the corrections does not vanish .",
    "for this , namely for @xmath87 the randomness of the @xmath2-space physics is exhibited in the randomness of the nuclear matrix elements entering into the definition of @xmath88 . as a consequence ,",

    "the value of @xmath6 as a function of @xmath142 is obtained from an assumed two - body interaction .",
    "this is described in appendix  [ app : app ] . the resulting hartree - fock energy for a fermi gas is shown in fig .  [ fig : hf ] and , for a reduced scale in @xmath142 , in fig .  [ fig : bind - energy ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : hf ] we see that for the assumed two - body interaction a minimum of the binding energy as a function of @xmath142 occurs at @xmath201 @xmath185 with the corresponding energy per particle of @xmath2027.3 mev .",
    "the potential can also be used to calculate the bare value of @xmath145 .",
    "this is discussed in appendix  [ app : appb ] .",
    "obtained values are given in tables [ tab : beta2_2 ] , [ tab : beta2_3 ] and [ tab : beta2_4 ] : they range from @xmath203 to @xmath204 mev@xmath205/nucleon .    in discussing our findings",
    "we first observe that , for a given fluctuation energy @xmath200 , a whole set of values for the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath3 exist such to satisfy the requirement i ) , namely @xmath206 , at @xmath207 @xmath185 .",
    "they lie on the curves displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : alfeps ] .",
    "furthermore @xmath9 and @xmath3 should also be such to fulfill the constraint @xmath208 which represents a fair estimate of the lower limit for the excitation energy of the 2p2h states .",
    "this restricts the acceptable values for @xmath9 and @xmath3 to the domain to the right of the dotted line in fig .",

    "this turned out to be possible and our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bind - energy ] and tables [ tab : beta2_2 ] , [ tab : beta2_3 ] and [ tab : beta2_4 ] .",
    "however there one sees that as one moves away from @xmath207 @xmath185 the equality between @xmath178 and @xmath179 is no longer exactly satisfied , although the two mean fields remain rather close in the range @xmath209 @xmath185 providing the values of @xmath200 are `` moderate '' .",
    "indeed , quantitatively , requirement i ) can be reasonably satisfied in the above quoted range of @xmath142 for @xmath210 mev only . for larger fluctuation energies",
    "@xmath178 and @xmath179 differ too much : an orientation on the size of the error around the mean field in thus obtained .",
    "concerning the energy averaging parameter , @xmath3 , is 1 mev larger that @xmath200 for all the cases listed in the tables .",
    "the values of the spectroscopic factors @xmath187 and @xmath188 are quite stable , while the values of the effective interaction @xmath189 and @xmath190 grow rapidly with increasing @xmath200 .",
    "most importantly , their values differ by three orders of magnitude from the bare @xmath145 .",
    "this is in part due to the renormalization ( see eqs .",
    "( [ vpqdefr ] ) and ( [ vqpdefr ] ) ) induced by the energy averaging .",
    "the random phase averaging also gives rise to a reduction in the magnitude of the residual interaction .",
    "rough calculations indicate that these two effects are sufficient to produce the observed sharp reduction .",
    "the analysis presented in sections [ sec : intro][sec : corrections ] is based on two propositions .",
    "it is assumed that the mean field is the slowly varying component of the nuclear interaction , which can be obtained by taking an appropriate energy average .",
    "secondly it is proposed that the matrix elements of the residual interaction are random , so that their average is zero . a formalism incorporating these ideas , borrowed from statistical reaction theory , was developed and explicit expressions for the mean field and the ` fluctuation ' away from the mean field was obtained .",
    "an expansion of the fluctuation energy in terms of increasing excitation complexity leads , after averaging , to formulas for the corresponding contributions to fluctuation energy .",
    "these formal discussion were followed in sect .",
    "[ sec : hf ] and [ sec : spectr - fact ] and [ sec : numerical - results ] by a simplified version and by a schematic model .",
    "the most remarkable result is a sharp reduction the effective strength of the residual interaction .",
    "but in addition the reasonableness of our results is very encouraging .    of course much",
    "remains to be done .",
    "the quantitative connection with the underlying nuclear forces has not been exhibited .",
    "the evaluation of the matrix elements for finite nuclei was not carried out and a better understanding of the energy average needs to be achieved .",
    "we have so far only a schematic model .",
    "what is needed is a complete and thorough evaluation .",
    "but what has been indicated is that such an evaluation will be successful .",
    "application to excited states is also indicated . in this case",
    "the smoothing function used in reaction theory can be used instead of the one of section [ sec : corrections ] . this would lead to a complex mean field and the excited state would have a width corresponding to the probability of the splitting of the state by the residual interaction .",
    "the width would then measure the extent of the splitting .",
    "to implement the program outlined in section [ sec : numerical - results ] we need a nn interaction to fix the hf energy of nuclear matter . for illustrative purposes we choose the following simple nn interaction @xmath211 which embodies a short - range repulsion in the first term and an intermediate range attraction in the second one ( all the parameters are positive and we require @xmath212 ) .",
    "the latter is taken of majorana type , hence the occurrence of the exchange operator @xmath213 built out of the spin @xmath214 and isospin @xmath215 operators .",
    "thus ( [ nninter ] ) contains the main features needed to account for the saturation of the nuclear forces , reflected in the existence of a minimum in the binding energy per particle @xmath216 versus @xmath142 curve , but for the tensor force that here , for the sake of simplicity , is neglected .    the hf energy for the interaction ( [ nninter ] )",
    "is easily worked out and leads to the following expression for the binding energy per particle @xcite @xmath217 \\label{binden } \\\\    & & - \\frac{1}{8\\pi k_f } \\biggl [   g_a \\mu_a^2       \\left ( 3 + \\frac{\\mu_a^2}{4k_f^2}\\right )      \\ , \\log \\left ( 1 + \\frac{4 k_f^2}{\\mu_a^2}\\right )       + \\frac{3}{2 }    g_b \\mu_b^2   \\left ( 3 + \\frac{\\mu_b^2}{4k_f^2}\\right )      \\ , \\log \\left ( 1 + \\frac{4 k_f^2}{\\mu_b^2}\\right ) \\biggr ] \\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath218 .    the parameters characterizing the potential ( [ nninter ] ) might be fixed , for example , by accounting for the `` experimental '' nuclear matter values previously quoted .",
    "one succeeds in doing so with the following choice    @xmath219    worth noticing is that the range of the repulsion obtained with the fitting procedure is rather close to the one associated with the exchange of a @xmath220 meson ( 3.97 @xmath185 ) , whereas the range of the attraction turns out to be intermediate to the one arising from the exchange of a pion and of a @xmath221 meson ( 0.71 @xmath185 and 2.79 @xmath185 , respectively ) .    here , we rather prefer to choose the parameters in such a way to have too little binding energy at too large a density in the hf frame , in order to conform to a shortcoming common to many nuclear matter calculations , the purpose being to ascertain whether the present theory is capable to improve upon the hf results .",
    "of course , there exists a variety of ways for reaching this scope : in view of the rather realistic values of the ranges @xmath222 and @xmath223 ( see ( [ muamub ] ) ) we change the coupling constants .",
    "we thus take , as a rather extreme example , @xmath224 which , together with the values for @xmath222 and @xmath223 given in ( [ muamub ] ) , yields a minimum of @xmath225 mev for the binding energy at @xmath201 @xmath185 , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hf ] , where the hf energy is displayed as a function of the density .",
    "in the language of second quantization the matrix element we have to calculate reads @xmath227 which , with standard manipulations , can be transformed into @xmath228 ( the matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ eqb1 ] ) are understood to be antisymmetrized ) .",
    "the above 9-dimensional integral , by appropriate transformations , can be reduced to a combination of 2- and 4-dimensional integrals , which can be numerically evaluated , yielding the results quoted in tables  [ tab : beta2_2][tab : beta2_4 ] .",
    "these values turn out to be helpful in performing a comparison with later findings .",
    "the direct contributions , namely the first three terms in the right hand side of ( [ beta2 ] ) , are analytically evaluated .",
    "considering , e.  g. , the third one , one gets @xmath229 \\biggr\\ } \\nonumber \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath230 .",
