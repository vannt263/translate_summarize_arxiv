    "@xmath2 mg has been studied very well as a typical case of well - deformed light - mass nuclear systems .",
    "after self - consistent microscopic calculations of the non - relativistic @xcite and relativistic methods @xcite in the late 1980s , the nucleus is believed to have an axially - symmetric and prolate shape in the ground state .",
    "assuming the core of @xmath3o , the ground state configuration is supposed to have eight valence particles occupying the d@xmath4 orbits ( four neutrons and four protons ) . since the fermi level of this nucleus is in the beginning of the sd - shell ( corresponding to the @xmath5 harmonic oscillator shell ) , there are many open valence orbitals above the fermi level , which may induce deformation , and consequently a collective rotation .",
    "such a rotational band has been already identified in experiments ( for instance , see ref .",
    "a particular interest is an existence of the two @xmath1 states observed in experiment .",
    "these two states are energetically close to each other ( the difference is about 2 mev ) . after the study of sheline et al .",
    "@xcite , it is believed that the second @xmath6 belongs to the ground - state rotational band ( g - band ) .",
    "valor , et al . analysed the g - band with the cranked skyrme hf + bcs approach as well as the configuration mixing approach based on the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) @xcite .",
    "however , their calculations assume axial symmetry for descriptions of intrinsic states . up to @xmath7 , they were able to reproduce the experimental data very well .",
    "the cranked mean - field calculation gave a fairly good agreement for @xmath8 , while the configuration mixing approaches returned larger energies for the state .",
    "this is simply because these states at high spin were projected out from the non - cranked mean - field state .",
    "interestingly , the cranked mean - field calculation for @xmath1 matches the observed energy of the first @xmath6 state , but the authors dismissed the agreement on the basis of the sheline s analysis @xcite , and they speculated that the disagreement might mainly come from the triaxial effects at high spin induced by the disappearance of the pairing correlation in their calculation .",
    "inspired by the study by valor et al .",
    "@xcite , we performed the self - consistent cranking calculation allowing triaxial deformation in a self - consistent manner . as a new aspect in our study ,",
    "not only 1d - cranking but also 3d - cranking calculations were carried out .",
    "an advantage of the 3d - cranking model is that low- and high - k intrinsic structures can be systematically studied @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian used in our study reads @xmath9 where the first term describes the one - body part , which is the spherical nilsson hamiltonian in this study , while the second part is the two - body interactions , which is the pairing - plus - quadrupole force ( so - called p@xmath10qq force ) .",
    "the model space ( valence space ) to diagonalise the two - body part contains two major shells ( @xmath11 ) in the spherical nilsson model , in accordance with the kummar - baranger criteria for the p@xmath10qq force @xcite .",
    "the variational state is the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ansatz , which is a generalised product state . with quasi - particle annihilation operators",
    "@xmath12 , the ansatz is expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the vacuum for the canonical basis @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "( in our case , the canonical basis correspond to the spherical nilsson basis . ) the canonical basis and the quasi - particle basis are connected by a unitary transformation called the general bogoliubov transformation @xcite .",
    "the variational equation is derived for @xmath17 in the above equation , @xmath18 is the @xmath19-th component of the angular momentum operator ( the index @xmath19 takes @xmath20 ) , and @xmath21 describes the number operator for proton ( @xmath22 ) and neutron ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "@xmath24 is an off - diagonal component of the quadrupole operator , defined as @xmath25 where the indices @xmath26 should be placed in a cyclic manner .",
    "each term with the lagrange multipliers ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) is necessary to put constraints in intrinsic states : @xmath29 the last constraint is necessary so as to keep the orientation of the angular momentum vector against the intrinsic coordinate axes @xcite .",
    "the variational equation is solved by means of the method of steepest descent .",
    "details of the method are presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "a deformed nilsson + bcs state is used for an initial trial state at @xmath30 .",
    "deformation parameters and gap energies for the trial state are determined by referring to the calculations of the liquid drop model by the mller and nix @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "the deformation parameters for the ground state are chosen to be @xmath31 and the pairing gap energies are @xmath32 .",
    "all the physical quantities , such as energy , quadrupole moments ( deformation ) , single - particle spin components , and gap energies , are self - consistently calculated under the above constraints in this framework .",
    "first of all , let us report the results from the 1d - cranking calculation . despite a use of a simple separable interaction ,",
    "the ground - state rotational spectra is reproduced reasonably well ( fig.[fig - ene ] ) . as valor ,",
    "et al . commented in ref.@xcite , the gap energies disappear both for protons and neutrons before @xmath33 ( fig.[fig - ene ] ) .",
    "triaxial deformation gradually decreases from @xmath34 .",
    "however , in @xmath35 , triaxial deformation can be still regarded negligible . in other words ,",
    "axial symmetry is kept fairly well . on the other hand , at high spin ( @xmath36 ) ,",
    "substantial triaxial deformation is formed ( @xmath37 ) , and axial symmetry is clearly broken .",
    "it should be noted here that the convention for the quadrupole deformation parameters ( @xmath38 ) in this study follows the hill - wheeler coordinates , which gives the opposite sign in @xmath39 to the so - called lund convention .",
    "a fact that the gamma deformation becomes negatively larger implies that the nucleus is reaching the non - collective rotational state ( @xmath40 , where the rotational axis corresponds to the shortest principal axis of the deformation .",
    ".evolution of the deformation in @xmath41 as a function of the total spin @xmath42 , which are obtained from the 1d - cranking calculation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the lower panel of fig.[fig - ph0 ] , the triaxial deformation is seen to have @xmath43 at @xmath44 . because the `` level crossing '' happens at @xmath45",
    ", we can not exactly see how the graph continues toward @xmath46 .",
    "however , from the trend of the graph , it is possible to guess that the graph forms a symmetric shape with respect to @xmath47 in the upper panel of fig.[fig - ph0 ] , and that @xmath48 for @xmath49 in the lower panel of fig.[fig - ph0 ] .",
    "this reflection symmetry around @xmath47 indicates that the state in @xmath50 and the state in @xmath51 have the same intrinsic structure .",
    "the ground - state rotational band was studied with the self - consistent 1d - cranking calculation .",
    "it was confirmed in this study that an effect of triaxiality in the nature of the rotational band is important at high spin , as previously anticipated by valor , et al .",
    "in addition , two high - spin states at @xmath52 observed in experiment were analysed by means of the self - consistent 3d - cranking calculation .",
    "it concludes ( in a qualitative manner ) that the yrast @xmath6 state is an axially - symmetric high-@xmath53 state created by the deformation - aligned protons and neutrons in the d@xmath4 orbitals while the second @xmath6 is a rotational member of the ground - state rotational band with substantial triaxial deformation .    for the first time , in the framework of the self - consistent and microscopic method , the two @xmath1 states in @xmath0 mg , which correspond to low- and high-@xmath53 states respectively , are explained on the same footing , that is , through the self - consistent 3d - cranking model .",
