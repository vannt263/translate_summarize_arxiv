    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystals are atomically thin films of van der waals materials that are stable when exfoliated from the three - dimensional crystal due to the weak nature of the interaction holding the individual layers together@xcite .",
    "examples of such materials include graphite@xcite , boron nitride@xcite , and transition metal dichalcogenides@xcite , which have shown that properties of monolayer and bilayer crystals may strongly differ from the bulk properties of these layered compounds .",
    "many of the transition metal dichalcogenides have been shown to possess optical properties that make them well suited for use in photodetectors and other optical or optoelectronic applications@xcite .",
    "another chalcogenide currently emerging as a high potential material for use on optical applications is the layered hexagonal metal chalcogenide inse , atomically thin films of which are possible to fabricate@xcite . while in its bulk form inse@xcite is a direct gap semiconductor @xcite , its electronic structure undergoes significant changes upon exfoliation to few - layer or monolayer thickness , with particularly interesting optical properties observed in recent experiments@xcite .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations for single layer crystals of inse@xcite predict a large increase in the band gap as compared to bulk crystals , with the valence band maximum slightly shifted from the @xmath3 point . despite being a van der waals layered material",
    ", bulk inse has a light effective mass for electrons in the conduction and valence band across the layers .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the band gap@xcite and related physical properties of few - layer inse will exhibit a strong dependence on the number of layers .    in this work",
    "we develop a tight - binding ( tb ) model of atomically thin inse , tracing the dependence of electronic and optical properties on the number of layers ( @xmath4 ) in the film .",
    "we use density functional theory ( dft ) to parametrize the model and apply a scissor correction to compensate for the underestimation of the band gap .",
    "indeed , we find that as compared to the majority of other layered materials with van der waals coupling between consecutive layers , which have the out - of - plane electron mass heavier than the in - plane mass , in inse this relation is reversed leading to a strong @xmath4-dependence of the band gap .",
    "also , the stacking of consecutive layers in few - layer @xmath7-inse similar to a - b - c stacking in graphite breaks the mirror - plane symmetry of monolayer inse , which should be expected to affect optical selection rules and so coupling in few - layer inse .",
    "we use the tb model developed here to predict the band structure of few - layer inse , and we develop a @xmath0 model to predict the optical properties , with the matrix elements of the momentum operator obtained from the tb model . we provide estimates for the band edge optical absorption coefficient as a function of the number of layers .",

    "call this scissor corrected tight - binding ( tb - sc ) .",
    "we do this by applying a constrained least squares minimization procedure to the difference between the tb and the scissor corrected dft band energies . while the procedure is in principle straightforward , in practice one must take care , in particular with the choice of bands to use for the fitting procedure . for comparison",
    ", we also perform a fit to the original dft data to obtain a parametrization without scissor correction ( tb ) .    on diagonalization the model yields 16 bands  8 even ( symmetric ) and 8 odd ( antisymmetric ) under @xmath11 .",

    "in addition , the dft calculation is less accurate in the higher energy unoccupied bands .",
    "we therefore fit the model to 7 dft bands - the 5 highest energy valence bands ( 3 even , 2 odd ) and the 2 lowest energy conduction bands ( 1 even , 1 odd ) , using bands 3 - 6 of the 8 even model bands , and bands 3 - 5 of the odd model bands . as our primary purpose is a good quantitative fit to the valence and conduction band edges , we give extra weights to these points during the fitting procedure .",

    "the model gives a good reproduction of the dft bands , both with and without scissor correction .",

    "it should be noted that the scissor correction is necessary for another reason as well .",
    "the tb model , when fitted to dft band structures without scissor correction , agrees well with the dft results for @xmath101 at small @xmath4 ( see fig . [",
    "fig_dz_abs_tbscvsdft]a ) . however , the extrapolation to large @xmath4 is considerably larger , and the saturation much slower , than that for the tb model calculated with scissor correction .",
    "likewise , the coefficient of the linear regime ( fig . [ fig_alpha_tbscvsdft ] ) is also larger if the scissor correction is omitted .",
    "in essence , uncorrected dft overestimates @xmath101 matrix elements , whereas the scissor correction leads to a significant reduction in @xmath101 , and in turn a reduced absorption .",
    "the origin of the reduction in @xmath101 when applying the scissor correction lies in the effect the scissor correction has on the tb wave functions for @xmath102 .",
    "[ fig_tbwf_n19]a shows the modulus square of the chalcogen @xmath103 tb wave function coefficients as a function of the sublayer index in 19-layer inse .",
    "the wave function reduces towards the edge of the slab but a clear finite value remains at the very edge , due to a substantial oscillation in the coefficients , which gives a substantial contribution to @xmath101 .",
    "[ fig_tbwf_n19]b shows the same wave function coefficients after scissor correction .",
    "note that the relative weight of the coefficient at the edge has now decreased , as has the aforementioned oscillation , which leads to an overall smaller @xmath101 and a faster saturation with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "the physics behind the reduction of the wave function at the edge is the relative reduction of the inter - layer interaction as compared to the intra - layer interaction , which is a direct consequence of the scissor correction . by increasing the gap without changing the band width caused by inter - layer hopping ,",
    "the intra - layer hopping becomes stronger while the inter - layer hopping remains at the same magnitude .",
    "this can be understood within a chain model , which we discuss below .",
