    "this is because @xmath136 ensures @xmath240 such that the solution is in @xmath87 .",

    "note that the density matrix of the input state , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and the observable of the real - life measurement @xmath272 , can be represented by four vectors @xmath273 , @xmath274 and @xmath275 .",
    "then the probability distributions have one to one correspondence with the inner products such as @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",

    "@xmath284 can be obtained by rotating @xmath279 around @xmath281 such that @xmath285 .",
    "thus the angle @xmath286 between @xmath287 and @xmath281 will range from @xmath288 to @xmath289 .",
    "then there must be a case where we have @xmath290 , which then leads to @xmath47 .    for higher dimensions",
    ", we can also represent @xmath34 , the projectors of eigenstates of observables @xmath6 and @xmath7 by coherent vectors and generators of the lie - algebra of @xmath291 as @xmath292 where @xmath293 are generators of the lie - algebra .",
    "they satisfy the restriction that @xmath294 .",
    "then one can see that the norm of @xmath281 is not relevant .",
    "what does matter is the direction of @xmath281 and the inter - angles between the vectors representing @xmath34 , @xmath295 and @xmath296 .",
    "so the conclusion of our theorem-1 in the main text is still valid for mixed states in the form of @xmath297 whose coherent vector is parallel with ( but shorter than ) @xmath281 , the coherent vector of @xmath298 . when @xmath89 , all the mixed states can be written in this form .",
    "that means that theorem-1 is valid for all qubit states , pure or mixed .    as to theorem-2 ,",
    "firstly let us redefine @xmath94 according to the mixed states in consideration , i.e. , @xmath299 and @xmath300 .",
    "suppose the spectrum representation of the density matrix is @xmath301 .",
    "the eigenvalues compose a probability distribution and we denote it as @xmath302 .",
    "now we can define @xmath303 , a @xmath75-dimensional sub - manifold of both @xmath88 and @xmath271 , with points whose coordinates @xmath260 satisfy the condition such that @xmath304 . since we have @xmath305 , the lower bound given by our theorem-2 is still valid",

    "<S> moreover , enormous @xmath52-functions make the point @xmath116 be the unique extreme point of @xmath72 in @xmath117 such that its minima value over @xmath112 must be obtained at the surface of @xmath112 . </S>",

    "<S> although not easy , the geometry of @xmath112 is much simpler than that of @xmath85 and analytical solution becomes reachable . </S>",
    "<S> so the generally valid strategy is to find the minima over @xmath112 .    after stating the mathematical correctness , </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss the physical implications of such a strategy . </S>",

    "<S> we will set up the inequality when the @xmath52-functions are the relative entropy , a prime concept in information theory with widely applications but generally not so easy to handle . on the way to the final answer </S>",
    "<S> , it is interesting that a new concept emerges as a nature extension of majorization .    </S>",
    "<S> * majorization by sections . * </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath71 , we can not conclude that @xmath25 is more certain than @xmath27 in the global sense . </S>",
    "<S> however if only particular outcomes are concerned , things will be different . </S>",
    "<S> let us relabel the eigenstates so that @xmath126 and @xmath127 , then cut the subscript string @xmath128 into short sections @xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> for each section , say the @xmath130-th one , we find out the probabilities according to the subscripts in this section and take their sum @xmath131 and @xmath132 ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 ) . </S>",

    "<S> ( if some zero - valued probabilities vanish the denominator , take the limit from infinitesimal positive factors . ) </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ section ] ) says that @xmath25 is relatively more certain than @xmath27 in each section . </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath136 to denote this relation where the index @xmath137 labels this particular partition of the subscript string . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath138 and @xmath139 are two distributions coarse - grained from @xmath25 and @xmath27 by this partition .    </S>",
    "<S> next , let us find all the coarsest partitions under which @xmath25 majorizes @xmath27 by sections . </S>",

    "<S> ( coarserdefined in such a way is a partial order , we can not say @xmath142 is coarser than @xmath143 . ) let us denote the set of all the coarsest partitions upon which @xmath25 majorizes @xmath27 by sections as @xmath144 . </S>",
    "<S> none of @xmath144 can be obtained by extra cutting from another one in it . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath144 is never an empty set since @xmath25 will always majorize @xmath27 by sections for the finest partition where each short section consists of only one subscript . then according to each partition in @xmath144 ( say , the one labeled by @xmath145 ) , </S>",
    "<S> we coarsen @xmath25 and @xmath27 to obtain distributions @xmath146 and @xmath147 in the way given above . </S>",

    "<S> * theorem-2 . * </S>",
    "<S> label the outcomes such that @xmath148 and @xmath149 . </S>",
    "<S> then if @xmath71 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 , there is a tradeoff relation @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the jensen - shannon divergence . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath102 serves as the lower bound if @xmath107 and @xmath154 for any possible partition @xmath155 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath156    the proof is left in the supplemental material . </S>",
    "<S> actually there is a one - to - one correspondence between the partitions of subscript string @xmath157 and the faces defined from @xmath111 on the surface of @xmath158 . </S>",
    "<S> what theorem-2 gives us is an algorithm of searching the lower bound on various faces , and such searching is generally necessary since @xmath158 is fixed but the point @xmath159 moves case by case . </S>",
    "<S> the second part of theorem-2 simply identifies a specific situation , namely , a case in point of such a complexity . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , for qubits , @xmath112 has a simple geometry and there is only one partition in @xmath144 . </S>",
    "<S> so the lower bound is straightforwardly @xmath102 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.2 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> an evident advantage of our operational definitions is that the experimental test can be easily performed . to test ozawa s inequality </S>",
    "<S> one needs three state method or the technology of weak measurement @xcite . while for ours , one just needs to arrange the devices according to fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.1 ] with only the input state in concern . </S>",
    "<S> when the qubit is coded by polarizations of photons , the experimental configuration includes only an ordinary single - photon source , four single - photon detectors and some wave plates .    </S>",
    "<S> * conclusions and discussions . </S>",
    "<S> * to summarize , the theory built in this letter bridges the theories of the proposition and the opposition in debate . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between error , disturbance and quantum uncertainty , three kinds of terms appeared in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ozawa ] ) , is clearly described by theorem-1 and theorem-2 , which state that if defining error and disturbance by probability distributions , the tradeoff is switched off if @xmath55 and switched on if @xmath71 . meanwhile , </S>",
    "<S> our theorems compose a state - dependent theory that is finer than the state - independent work arxives where error and disturbance are also defined by probability distributions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , theorem-2 tells that the jensen - shannon divergence and the coarse - grained distributions serve in the lower bound , thus giving an answer to the open question asked in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    for further generalization </S>",
    "<S> , one could consider input ensembles described by mixed states due to the lack of classical information . </S>",
    "<S> some recent work makes progress in this direction , such as tighter bounds @xcite and separating uncertainty into quantum and classical parts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show in the supplemental material that theorem-2 is valid for all the mixed input states , and theorem-1 is robust to depolarization noise , i.e. , valid for ensembles described by @xmath160 , as well as for all qubit states , pure or mixed . </S>",
    "<S> we leave the more general case as an open question . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting topic is the connection between error - disturbance theory and the multipartite quantum correlations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we hope our work could supply or inspire new ideas and methods in the study of quantum uncertainty and quantum measurements .    </S>",
