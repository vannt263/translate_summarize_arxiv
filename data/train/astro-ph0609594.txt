    "quasars whose optical emission is hidden by dust in the optical and gas in the soft x - ray have always been hard to find . however",
    ", a large type-2 ( hidden ) quasar population has long been predicted , both from the statistics of seyfert-1 and 2 galaxies , and from those of radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars . a large population of hidden agn is also predicted from models of the x - ray background ( e.g.  comastri et al .",
    "1995 ; worsley et al .",
    "2005 ) , though most models predict these agn to be of seyfert rather than quasar luminosity .",
    "some success in finding dust obscured quasars has been obtained using selection based on the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) to find lightly dust - reddened ( rest frame extinctions @xmath3 ) quasars , based either on 2mass colors alone ( cutri et al .",
    "2001 ) , or on 2mass combined with a radio detection and very red optical - ir colors ( glikman et al .",
    "only recently , however , have large samples of type-2 quasars , with rest - frame @xmath4 been found .",
    "zakamsaka et al .",
    "( 2003 ) used the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) to find objects with the high - ionization narrow - line spectra characteristic of type-2 agn . combining _ iso _ and 2mass data allowed haas et al .",
    "( 2004a ) and leipski et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to find significant numbers of obscured agn , including several type-2 quasars .",
    "_ spitzer _ data has been used to find highly - obscured agn , both through mid - infrared color selection ( lacy et al .",
    "2004 [ hereafter paper i ] , 2005a ; stern et al .  2005 ; alonso - herrero et al .  2005",
    "; polletta et al .  2006 ) and joint radio - infrared selection ( martnez - sansigre et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ; weedman et al .  2006 ; donley et al .",
    "type-1 quasars selected through joint spitzer and optical colors and/or morphologies have been targeted by several groups ( brown et al .",
    "2005 ; hatziminaoglou et al .  2005 ; siana et al .",
    "also , the mid - infrared properties of x - ray selected agn have been discussed by treister et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and barmby et al .",
    ".    mid - infrared selection of agn is effective because dust heated by the agn forms a `` calorimeter '' , whose luminosity is not as strongly affected by obscuration as that in most other wavelength bands ( except the radio ) ( e.g.  spinoglio et al .",
    "1995 ; meisenheimer et al .",
    "2001 ; ogle et al .",
    "richards et al .",
    "( 2006 ) show that the bolometric correction in the mid - infrared varies little for different subsamples of type-1 quasars ( e.g.  optically or infrared luminous , optically - red or optically blue ) , or luminosity , and that about 15% of the bolometric luminosity of a quasar is emitted at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "integration over the richards et al .",
    "( 2006 ) mean quasar sed as a whole suggests that about 40% of the emission from a typical quasar is reprocessed by dust in the infrared .",
    "this means that mid - infrared selection of agn is probably a good proxy for selection on the basis of bolometric luminosity , at least for those objects which are not so highly obscured that their mid - infrared luminosity is significantly supressed .",
    "much of the dust emission is thought to arise in the `` obscuring torus '' required by unified schemes ( e.g.  antonucci 1993 ) , though it is becoming increasingly clear that host dust in the narrow line region of agn also contributes significantly ( e.g.  mason et al .",
    "agn are an important global contributor to the mid - infrared luminosity density .",
    "brand et al .  ( 2006 ) show that the luminosity density of mid - ir emission in samples of mips 24@xmath0 m sources selected at mjy levels is dominated by agn , only at submjy levels do star forming galaxies begin to dominate .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on optical spectroscopic follow - up of agn candidates selected according to the mid - infrared color criteria presented in paper i. by selecting relatively bright objects from wide - area _",
    "surveys we are able to find many obscured agn with mid - infrared luminosities typical of quasars at moderate redshifts .",
    "these objects provide a good complement to the mostly lower - luminosity or higher redshift agn found in surveys such as the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) and the chandra deep fields .",
    "preliminary results from the spectroscopic follow - up of the sample presented in paper 1 were given in lacy et al .",
    "( 2005a ) . in this paper",
    ", we describe the selection of samples of mid - infrared selected agn candidates flux - limited at 24@xmath0 m from both the extragalactic first look survey ( xfls ) and the _ spitzer _ wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ) xmm - lss field ( lonsdale et al .",
    "2005 ) , and their spectrosopic follow - up observations .",
    "we classify the optical spectra according to the type of agn , and use them to place a lower bound on the fraction of obscured quasars and luminous seyfert galaxies .",
    "we also investigate the x - ray fluxes of those objects which fall on archival observations made with the x - ray multiple mirror telescope ( _ xmm - newton _ ) . a more detailed analysis of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and x - ray properties of the agn will be carried out in a later paper ( petric et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we selected samples of agn by mid - infrared color from the xfls and swire xmm fields .",
    "the basis of our color selection technique is described in sajina , lacy & scott ( 2005 ) and paper i , though the samples in this paper are flux - limited at 24@xmath0 m rather than at 8@xmath0 m as was the case for the sample of paper 1 . to obtain the xfls sample , we began by matching the xfls 24@xmath0 m catalog of fadda et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to the infrared array camera ( irac ) 4-band catalog of lacy et al .",
    "all mips 24@xmath0 m detections with detections in all four irac bands were then plotted on the color - color diagram of figure 1 . for the swire xmm sample",
    ", we used the bandmerged swire irac / mips 24@xmath0 m catalog available from the _ spitzer _ popular products website .",
    "the color cut used to select agn candidates was @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the @xmath11 cut was moved by @xmath12 compared to paper i. the exact position of this cut is not critical , and it was felt that shifting this would help remove non - agn contaminants , particularly as the final 5.8@xmath0 m fluxes in the xfls catalogue were increased by @xmath13% in the final version of the xfls catalog relative to the catalog used in paper i. we discuss the exact placement of the color cuts with respect to the completeness of the agn selection in section 5.3 .",
    "candidates were selected down to limiting 24@xmath0 m fluxes of 4.4mjy in the xfls and 6.6mjy in the swire xmm field .",
    "the 24@xmath0 m flux limited sample should be an improvement on 8@xmath0 m selection by making us more sensitive to highly - reddened objects , and high redshift objects , where the strong @xmath14-correction on the mid - infrared dust emission means that they drop out of flux - limited samples selected at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the disadvantage of this selection is that we will be missing objects at @xmath15 which have strong silicate absorption in the 24@xmath0 m band , however , as our median redshift is @xmath16 only a few objects will be missed due to this effect .",
    "the xfls sample is complete for objects falling in the irac `` agn wedge '' color selection to a flux limit of 4.6mjy at @xmath17 m , and the swire sample to a flux limit of 6.6mjy ( note that all mips sources down to these flux limits have 4-band irac detections ) .",
    "approximately 20% of mips 24@xmath0 m sources at these flux levels fall into our agn - dominated part of the color - color plot .",
    "a few stars and nearby galaxies have been removed from the samples .",
    "most stars were only present in the initial selection due to photometric errors related to saturation in the shorter irac bands , though one star ( sstxfls j172432.8 + 592646 , see paper i ) has the correct colors to fall in the sample , presumably due to a dust disk .",
    "very low redshift ( @xmath18 ) galaxies are also possible contaminants due to the presence of 6.2@xmath0 m pah emission in the 5.8@xmath0 m band of irac ( sajina , lacy & scott 2005 ) .",
    "the interacting galaxy arp 54 appeared in the selection of the swire agn sample , but has been removed for this reason .",
