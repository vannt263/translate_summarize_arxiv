    "magnetic properties of transition - metal compounds are generally described with the heisenberg spin hamiltonian that may be augmented by additional terms responsible for the anisotropy .",
    "for example , the following hamiltonian @xmath15 accounts for a variety of experimental situations . here , the first term describes the isotropic coupling @xmath16 between spins on sites @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the second term is the single - ion anisotropy @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is a unitary vector along @xmath21 , whereas @xmath22 and @xmath23 are quantum - mechanical spin operators .",
    "although a handful of solvable heisenberg models exist,@xcite the complex algebra of the spin operators generally impedes analytical solutions .    a widely used approximation of a heisenberg model is its classical treatment : the original quantum mechanical spin operators @xmath22 are replaced by real - space vectors @xmath24 .",
    "this transformation leads to enormous alleviation of the computational effort , even if the topology of exchange couplings is very intricate .",
    "a fundamental limitation of classical models is their inability to account for quantum - mechanical singlets and the ensuing underestimation of the ground state ( gs ) energy . indeed , for an antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange coupling @xmath16 , the energy of the quantum - mechanical singlet state is always lower than the classical energy @xmath25 of the antiparallel spin arrangement . at the same time , the relative energy gain of a singlet scales as @xmath26 , thus being maximal for @xmath27 and infinitesimal in the @xmath28 limit .",
    "presently , there is an empirical evidence that for @xmath29 , classical models capture the essential physics and correctly reproduce the experimental magnetic behavior.@xcite in contrast , classical models often fail to predict the correct gs and magnetic excitation spectrum for the extreme `` quantum '' case of @xmath27 . further on , many @xmath30 systems , e.g.,one - dimensional ( 1d ) haldane chains,@xcite can not be treated classically .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to establish the applicability limits for the classical approximation , in order to distinguish between the `` classical '' cases amenable to a simplified model treatment , and the `` quantum '' cases that require the complete quantum - mechanical solution of the spin hamiltonian .    a feasible way towards better understanding of these limits are real material studies , that allow for a direct comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "previous work on the quantum - classical crossover rendered the quasi-1d @xmath31 magnets as the relevant playground . despite the relatively large spin of 3/2 , the pronounced",
    "one - dimensionality may lead to sizable quantum fluctuations and , thus , to deviations from the classical behavior .",
