    "statistics of rare events , or large deviations , in chemical reactions and systems of birth - death type have attracted a great deal of interest in many areas of science including physics , chemistry , astrochemistry , epidemiology , population biology , cell biochemistry , _ etc . _",
    "large deviations become of vital importance when discrete ( non - continuum ) nature of a population of  particles \" ( molecules , bacteria , cells , animals or even humans ) drives it to extinction .",
    "a standard way of putting the discreteness of particles into theory is the master equation @xcite which describes the evolution of the probability of having a certain number of particles of each type at time @xmath2 .",
    "the master equation is rarely soluble analytically , and various approximations are in use @xcite .",
    "one widely used approximation is the fokker - planck equation which usually gives accurate results in the regions around the peaks of the probability distribution , but fails in its description of large deviations , that is the distribution tails @xcite . not much is known beyond the fokker - planck description . in some particular cases ( especially , for single - step birth - death processes ) complete statistics , including large deviations , were determined by applying various approximations directly to the pertinent master equation @xcite .",
    "a different group of approaches employs the generating function formalism @xcite , see below . here",
    "the master equation is transformed into a linear partial differential equation ( pde ) for the generating function , and this pde is analyzed / solved by various techniques such as the method of second quantization @xcite or the more recent time - dependent wkb approximation @xcite .",
    "recently , we combined the generating function technique with the sturm - liouville theory of linear differential operators and developed a _",
    "spectral theory _ of rare events @xcite . in this theory",
    "the problem of computing the complete statistics of ( not necessarily single - step ) birth - death systems reduces to solving an eigenvalue problem for a linear differential operator , the coefficients of which are determined by the reaction rates .    in this paper",
    "we apply the spectral method to the paradigmatic problem of branching @xmath3 and annihilation @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are fixed .",
    "this multi - step single - species birth - death process describes , for example , chemical oxidation reactions @xcite .",
    "if the branching rate is much higher than the annihilation rate ( the case we will be mostly interested in throughout the paper ) , a long - lived metastable , or quasi - stationary , state exists where the two processes ( almost ) balance each other .",
    "still , this long - lived state slowly decays with time , because a sufficiently large fluctuation ultimately brings the system into the absorbing state of no particles from which there is a zero probability of exiting . in this type of problems",
    "one is interested in the extinction time statistics and in the complete probability distribution , including large deviations , of the quasi - stationary state ( formally defined as the limiting distribution conditioned on non - extinction ) .",
    "turner and malek - mansour @xcite calculated the mean extinction time in this system by solving a recursion equation for the extinction probability .",
    "more recently , elgart and kamenev @xcite revisited this problem in the light of their time - dependent wkb approximation for the generating function .",
    "their insightful method readily yields an estimate of the mean extinction time , but only up to a ( significant ) pre - exponential factor",
    ". the quasi - stationary distribution for this system has not been previously found , and calculating it will be our major objective . in the language of the spectral theory , the mean extinction time represents the inverse eigenvalue of the ground state , while the quasi - stationary distribution is derivable from the ground state eigenfunction .",
    "the paradigmatic branching - annihilation problem , considered in this paper , has an additional value , as it helps settle one unresolved issue of the spectral theory . in the previous works @xcite we considered reactions that conserve parity of the particles .",
    "the parity conservation provides an additional boundary condition for the pde for the generating function which ensures a closed formulation of the problem already at the stage of the time - dependent pde .",
    "the branching - annihilation process , considered in the present work , does _ not _ conserve parity .",
    "as we will show , the  lacking \" boundary condition emerges here ( and in a host of other problems of this type ) only at the stage of the sturm - liouville theory .",
    "here is how we organize the rest of the paper . in section",
    "ii we apply the spectral method and reduce the governing master equations to a proper sturm - liouville problem . in section iii",
    "we employ a matched asymptotic expansion to approximately calculate the ground - state eigenvalue and eigenfunction and obtain the long - time asymptotics of the generating function .",
    "this asymptotics is used in section iv to extract the quasi - stationary probability distribution and compare it with our numerical results . in section",
    "v we calculate the mean extinction time and extinction probability distribution and compare these results with the previous work and with our numerics .",
    "some final comments are presented in section vi .",
    "we consider the branching and annihilation reactions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are the rate constants .",
    "the ( mean - field ) rate equation for the number of particles @xmath10 , @xmath11 predicts a nontrivial attracting steady state @xmath12 .",
    "fluctuations invalidate this mean - field result due to the existence of an absorbing state at @xmath13 . however , when @xmath14 , there exists a long - lived fluctuating _ metastable _ ( or quasi - stationary ) state , which _ slowly _ decays in time , implying a slow growth of the extinction probability .",
    "the statistics of this quasi - stationary state and of the extinction times are in the focus of our attention here .    the master equation for the probability @xmath15 to find @xmath16 particles at time @xmath2 can be written as @xmath17\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\lambda\\left[(n-1)p_{n-1}(t)-np_{n}(t)\\right]\\,,\\;\\;\\;n\\ge1\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{d}{dt}{p}_{0}(t)&= & \\mu p_2(t)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we introduce the generating function @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an auxiliary variable .",

    "<S> we apply the spectral method , recently developed by the authors , to calculate the statistics of a reaction - limited multi - step birth - death process , or chemical reaction , that includes as elementary steps branching @xmath0 and annihilation @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral method employs the generating function technique in conjunction with the sturm - liouville theory of linear differential operators . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the limit when the branching rate is much higher than the annihilation rate , and obtain accurate analytical results for the complete probability distribution ( including large deviations ) of the metastable long - lived state , and for the extinction time statistics . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical results are in very good agreement with numerical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we use this example to settle the issue of the  lacking \" boundary condition in the spectral formulation . </S>"
