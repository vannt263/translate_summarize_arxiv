    "since the first detection of waves in sunspots @xcite , many studies have been carried out to understand the physics of these waves , from the observational as well as theoretical point of view .",
    "waves in sunspots are different from those observed in quiet sun due to the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "they show a variety of behavior depending on the height and the region of the sunspot where they are observed . usually , these waves are classified as photospheric umbral oscillations , chromospheric umbral oscillations , and running penumbral waves @xcite",
    ". however , all these kind of waves seem to be different manifestations of the same global propagation of magneto - acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "the reasons to study waves extend beyond the derivation of their properties , because waves can also be used as independent diagnostic of sunspot structure @xcite .    at the photosphere in the umbra ,",
    "the power spectra of the oscillations are quite similar to the corresponding ones of the quiet sun , with a broad distribution of frequencies and a clear peak at about 3 mhz @xcite . in sunspots",
    ", these oscillations in the 5 min band have reduced amplitudes compared to the surrounding quiet photosphere @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field also modifies the @xmath1modes and produces new modes of fluctuations not present in the quiet sun @xcite .",
    "generally , most of the photospheric umbra is covered by coherent oscillations @xcite .",
    "waves are usually studied by measuring the fluctuations of intensity and line - of - sight velocity from doppler shift , but they are also supposed to affect magnetic field . from full stokes inversions , @xcite found an upper limit of 4 g for the amplitude of 5 minute oscillations in magnetic field strength , while @xcite detected variations around 7 - 11 g. in a later work , @xcite interpreted magnetic field oscillations as being due to fast and slow magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) wave modes , producing both intrinsic variations of the magnetic field and those due to the shift of the line forming region .",
    "the chromosphere of sunspots is dominated by 3 min oscillations .",
    "the power spectra usually show sharp peaks around 5 - 6 mhz , and the power drops gradually to noise values in the interval from 8 mhz to 10 - 15 mhz @xcite .",
    "several spectral lines , formed at different heights from the photosphere to the chromosphere , can be used to sample the wave propagation properties .",
    "simultaneous time - series of these spectral lines are a powerful tool for studying sunspot waves . from phase spectra between the umbral oscillations observed in the photospheric line  @xmath0 5233 and in h@xmath2",
    ", @xcite found that the phase delay indicates upward wave propagation .",
    "@xcite inferred that slow mode waves propagate upward into the chromosphere in the frequency band around 6.5 mhz , based on the phase differences between the oscillations of  @xmath0 8498 ,  @xmath0 8542 and  @xmath0 5434 . from the study of the doppler shifts observed in the intensity profiles of the  @xmath0 10830 multiplet , @xcite presented evidence of shock formation at the chromosphere .",
    "@xcite reproduced the phase spectra between chromospheric and photospheric velocity oscillations with a model of linear vertical propagation of slow magnetoacoustic waves in a stratified magnetized atmosphere that accounts for radiative loses , finding a good agreement between the theoretically computed time delay , and the one obtained from the cross - correlation of photospheric  @xmath0 10827 and chromospheric @xmath0 10830 velocity maps , filtered around the 6 mhz band .",
    "they showed that the chromospheric 6 mhz signal is a result of linear wave propagation of the photospheric perturbations in the 6 mhz range , rather than the consequence of the nonlinear interaction of photospheric modes as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the works cited above were limited to the study of oscillations at only two heights ( one photospheric and one chromospheric ) , separated by several hundreds of kilometers .",
    "it is thus interesting to perform a more detailed sampling of the sunspot atmosphere , using more spectral lines formed at several intermediate heights between these two regions . on the one hand , observationally detected spatial wave patterns in sunspots are rather complex @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "recent numerical simulations of waves in sunspots also suggest a complex picture of the fast and slow magneto - acoustic waves propagating simultaneously in the same layers but in different directions and with different phase speeds @xcite .",
    "this requires a more refined multi - layer study of sunspot waves .",
    "studies of this kind often represent an observational challenge since several spectral lines have to be detected simultaneously not only in intensity but also in polarized light . in our paper",
    ", we report on such multi - line spectropolarimetric observations .",
    "our aim is to cover the gap between the photospheric and chromospheric signals and analyze sunspot oscillations at the formation heights of several spectral lines formed between  and . for that we use simultaneous observations obtained with two instruments , the polarimetric littrow spectrograph ( polis , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the tenerife infrared polarimeter ii ( tip - ii , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , attached to the german vacuum tower telescope at the observatorio del teide at tenerife .",
    "apart from information about waves , our multi - layer study has also allowed us to estimate the formation heights of the spectral lines in the sunspot atmosphere , including  line , several  blends in the wing of this line and the infrared lines of  at @xmath0 10827   and  at @xmath0 10830  .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in sect .",
    "[ sect : observation ] , the observations and data reduction are explained .",
    "section [ sect_ana ] describes the analysis of the velocity oscillations at several heights .",
    "the results are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect_disc ] , which also presents our conclusions .",
    "the observations analyzed in this work were obtained on 2007 august 28 with two different instruments , polis and tip - ii , attached to the german vacuum tower telescope ( vtt ) at the observatorio del teide .",
    "simultaneous and co - spatial scans of a sunspot located near the center of the sun ( @xmath3 ) were taken with both instruments .",
    "the slit was placed over the center of the sunspot .",
    "the observations were obtained with real - time seeing correction by the kiepenheuer - institute adaptive optics system @xcite .",
    "the spectra of the blue channel of polis include  @xmath0 3968   intensity profiles and some photospheric line blends in the wings of , covering a spectral range from 3964.9   to 3971.3   with a spectral sampling of 20 m  pixel@xmath4 and a spatial sampling of @xmath5 per pixel .",
    "the ca spectra were reduced for the flatfield @xcite , and were also corrected for the transmission curve of the order - selecting interference filter in front of the camera . for the wavelength calibration ,",
    "the line - core positions of the iron lines at 3965.45 , 3966.07 , 3966.63 , 3967.42 and 3969.26   in an average quiet sun region were determined by a second order polynomial fit .",
    "we then determined the wavelength scale that matched best all the position values .",
    "tip - ii yielded the four stokes parameters @xmath6 in a spectral range from 10822.7   to 10833.7  with a spectral sampling of 11 m  pixel@xmath4 and a spatial sampling of @xmath7 per pixel .",
    "this spectral region contains information about two different heights of the solar atmosphere due to the presence of two spectral lines .",
    "the  line at 10827.09   is formed at photospheric heights , whereas the  @xmath0 10830 triplet , which includes a weak blue component at 10829.09   and two blended red components at 10830.25 and 10830.34  , forms in the chromosphere @xcite . in this case",
    ", the wavelength calibration was done using the  and  lines as references .",
    "the full data set consists of three temporal series ; each of them lasting about one hour .",
    "three scan steps with @xmath8 step width were taken for the two first series , while in the last series only two spatial positions were used .",
    "the cadence was different for all series .",
    "table [ tb : observation ] shows the time step between two spectra taken at the same spatial position , the time when the observation were obtained and the number of repetitions of each series .",
    ".summary of observations : [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have presented an analysis of the los velocities obtained from at set of spectropolarimetric data in the near - ir spectral region around 10830   and the optical region around 3969   in a sunspot atmosphere and its vicinity . from these two spectral ranges",
    ", we retrieve on the one hand the doppler velocities of the photospheric  @xmath0 10827 and the chromospheric @xmath0 10830 line . on the other hand",
    ", we also sample several layers between these two heights , using the doppler shifts of the chromospheric  line core and the photospheric  lines from the wings of the  line .",
    "the histograms of los velocities show that the width of the velocity distribution increases with height , both in the sunspot and the quiet sun atmosphere .",
    "quiet sun rms velocities are larger than those in the sunspot due to the higher power of oscillations in the quiet sun .",
    "the growth of the amplitude of the oscillations with height is scaled by the pressure scale height @xmath9 .",
    "it is smaller in the umbra than in the quiet sun atmosphere , so the amplitude of umbral oscillations rises faster .",
    "this yields that the ratio of the quiet sun and umbral rms velocities of the same lines decreases with the formation height of the lines .",
    "the phase difference spectra of los velocities between several pairs of lines show upward propagating waves for frequencies higher than 4 mhz .",
    "the power at lower frequencies does not propagate up , since waves with these frequencies are evanescent .",
    "the slope of the phase spectra , together with the histograms of los velocity , allows us to sort all the spectral lines used in this work by their formation height .",
    "phase and amplification spectra were fitted to a model of linear wave propagation in a stratified atmosphere with radiative losses following the newton cooling law .",
    "the model works reasonably well at layers below the formation height of the  line core , where waves propagate in a linear regime , while it fails in the fit of the amplification spectrum between the  velocity and the  line core velocity , due to the importance of nonlinearities at these chromospheric heights .    from the fit to the model , we retrieved the temperature , the difference in geometrical height between the formation heights of both spectral lines , and the radiative relaxation time . setting the height of the lowermost forming line ( ) to agree with @xcite , the formation height of all the lines in sunspots was inferred .",
    "the  lines from the wings of the  line are formed about 250 km above the photospheric  line .",
    "the relative position of the lines is well determined by the observations , since the rms velocities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : velocity_hist ] ) , the power spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : power_spectra ] ) , and the phase and amplification spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dfase_fesi ] ) all indicate that the  lines are formed in the upper photosphere above the  line .",
    "the temperatures obtained for the spectral lines then show a good agreement with the temperature stratification of the @xcite sunspot model , and the formation heights are coherent with previous estimates .",
    "it must , however , be taken into account that the estimate of the formation height from response functions in @xcite was performed for a static atmosphere and has an strong dependence on the atmosphere model employed .",
    "most of the power of the photospheric lines is concentrated in a prominent peak at 3.5 mhz , in the 5 minute band . from a comparison between the power spectra of the  and one of the  lines , it is interesting to note that the power peak is exactly at the same position , although the iron line forms at around 200 km above the silicon one .",
    "the same behavior was found for the chromospheric  line and the  line core , which peak at around 6 mhz , corresponding to the 3 minute band .",
    "the maximum of the power spectra is not shifted gradually from 3.5 mhz at the photosphere to higher frequencies at larger heights , but the photospheric and chromospheric group of lines show a discontinuous behavior .",
    "waves at frequencies above the cut - off increase their amplitude with height faster than evanescent waves below the cut - off , resulting in larger power of 3-minute waves at chromospheric heights . yet , as follows from fig .",
    "[ fig : power_spectra]b , the los velocity power at frequencies above 4 mhz measured from of the  line is higher than the one from the  line ; it means that already in the upper photosphere the high - frequency power becomes important .",
    "this finding suggests that high - frequency waves prominent in the chromosphere have to be generated in the photosphere or below and their dominance at the chromospheric height is the result of their large amplitude increase .",
    "these results are consistent with those obtained from observations by @xcite using two  and  lines , and from numerical simulations by @xcite .    from the compatibility between our observations and a simple wave model",
    ", we conclude that we observe a continuous field - aligned propagation of slow magneto - acoustic waves in the upper atmosphere of sunspot .",
    "these waves first reach the formation height of , then the formation height of the  lines from the  line wing located in the upper photosphere , then the formation height of the  line core and finally that of the  line .",
