    "the deduction of the azimuthal quantum force from the ginzburg - landau theory and experimental facts will be described also in this section 2 .",
    "the explanation of some paradoxical phenomena with help of the azimuthal quantum force will be considered in the section 3 .",
    "the ginzburg - landau theory @xcite describes superconducting state with help of the gl wave function @xmath0 , in which @xmath1 is interpreted as the density of superconducting pairs and @xmath2 is momentum of single pair with the mass @xmath3 and the charge @xmath4 .",
    "superconducting current density is @xmath5 when @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the quantization can be deduced from the requirement that the complex wave function must be single - valued @xmath7 at any point in superconductor @xcite .",
    "therefore , its phase must change by integral multiples of @xmath8 following a complete turn along the path of integration , yielding the bohr - sommerfeld quantization @xmath9 according to the relations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and @xmath10 the integral of the current density along any closed path inside superconductor @xmath11 must be connected with the integral quantum number @xmath12 and the magnetic flux @xmath13 inside the closed path @xmath14 .",

    "the discreteness of permitted states spectrum of superconducting ring ( 4 ) at @xmath30 is beyond any doubt because of numerous experimental evidences , in particular because of numerous observations of quantum periodicity of different parameters in magnetic field @xmath31 .",
    "the quantum periodicity is observed because of the change with magnetic flux value @xmath13 of the integer quantum number @xmath12 corresponding to minimal kinetic energy @xmath32 of superconducting pairs .",
    "this phenomenon was observed first as far back as 1962 by w. a. little and r. d. parks @xcite at measurements of the resistance of thin cylinder in the temperature region corresponding to its superconducting resistive transition .",
    "later on , the quantum oscillations of the ring resistance @xmath33 @xcite , its magnetic susceptibility @xmath34 @xcite , the critical current @xmath35 @xcite and the dc voltage @xmath36 measured on segments of asymmetric rings @xcite were observed .",

    "the velocity of pairs and the persistent current ( 4 ) should be non - zero at @xmath23 when the whole ring is superconducting and the spectrum of the permitted states ( 5 ) is strongly discrete @xmath51 ( on the left ) .",

    "the transition between the discrete spectrum with @xmath52 and continuous spectrum with @xmath53 , deduced on the base of the ginzburg - landau theory , was observed in numerous experiments .",
    "for example , it is observed at measurements of the critical current @xmath54 @xcite when the external current @xmath55 used for @xmath56 measuring switches at @xmath57 the ring in the normal state @xmath58 at each measurement and the ring comes back in superconducting state @xmath59 when the @xmath55 value decreases down to zero , see fig.2,3 in @xcite .",
    "the quantum periodicity @xmath60 @xcite testifies to non - zero persistent current @xmath52 in superconducting state whereas in the normal state the electrical current @xmath61 circulating in a ring with an inductance @xmath62 should decay during the relaxation time @xmath63 because of a non - zero resistance @xmath64 .",
    "the time of each measurement of the critical current @xmath54 @xcite is much longer than the relaxation time @xmath63 .",

    "the mobile charge carriers accelerate in direction opposite to the electromagnetic force in this case as well as in the meissner effect . their angular momentum @xmath67 changes from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "it is well known that the electrical current should decay at @xmath64 because of the dissipation force @xmath70 acting between electrons and the crystalline lattice of ions .",
    "therefore the angular momentum of both the mobile charge carriers and the crystalline lattice of ions change after the transition of the ring in the normal state .",
    "we should think that the both one should change also at the transition in superconducting state , although no force acting between mobile charge carriers and the crystalline lattice of ions could be indicated in this case . without this balance it could be possible to have rotated a ring merely with help of its switching between superconducting and normal states at @xmath23 inside it . the angular momentum of superconducting pairs should change although without a known force but , at least , because of the known cause - the quantization ( 2,3 ) .",
    "the angular momentum of ions should change even without this cause in order the ring could not rotate .",
    "thus , the puzzle indicated by j.e .",
    "hirsch @xcite in the meissner effect is observed also at the ring switching from normal to superconducting state . in the second case",
    "this puzzle is even more mysterious .",
    "the direction , clockwise or anticlockwise , in which the mobile charge carriers accelerate against the electromagnetic force , depends only on the direction of magnetic field in the meissner effect whereas in the ring this direction depends on the value of magnetic field @xmath31 .",
    "the experiments testify that if , for example , this direction is clockwise at @xmath71 than it will be anticlockwise at @xmath72 .",
    "a theory must be very ingenious in order to include a force the direction of which could change with a value",
    ". other question , which can puzzle any theorist , may be connected with possibilities to close the wave function @xmath0 in a ring segment @xmath49 , fig.1 .",
    "the quantum theory predicts even a mechanical force , which can be measured , at a mechanical closing of the superconducting ring , see the end of @xcite .",
    "the force should act because of the energy difference between superconducting states of the ring with zero and non - zero velocity of pairs @xcite .",
    "but no theory can answer on the questions : `` why and how quickly can the velocity of pairs in a segment @xmath73 change from @xmath74 to @xmath75 after the transition of the @xmath49 segment into the superconducting state @xmath76 ? '' , fig.1 .",
    "this puzzle is more terrible than the acceleration of pairs in direction opposite to the electromagnetic force .",
    "the cause ( the transition of the @xmath49 segment in superconducting state ) and the effect ( the change of pair velocity in the @xmath73 segment ) may be spatially separated , fig.1 . therefore a theory must provide a defined time during which the transition of the @xmath49 segment can change the velocity in the spatially separated segment @xmath73 .",
    "i think it is easier to measure this time experimentally than to find a theory which could include this time .",
    "i did not lay claim in @xcite to a solution of these puzzles , as well as of the meissner effect puzzle .",
    "the azimuthal quantum force was introduced in @xcite in order to explain some other puzzles observed when ring segments or the whole ring are switched many times @xmath77 , with a frequency @xmath78 , between normal and superconducting state .",
    "the azimuthal quantum force does not explain why the mobile charge carriers and the ions can accelerate against the electromagnetic force .",
    "it is deduced from this puzzle .",
    "hirsch argues @xcite _ `` that there is no physical basis for such an azimuthal force''_. i agree with this assertion if only the universally recognised quantum formalism , in particular the ginzburg - landau theory , and above all numerous experimental results can not be considered as the physical basis . the quantum formalism ( 4 ) states , in full accordance with all experimental results , that the persistent current must appear at the closing of superconducting state in the ring , fig.1 .",
    "the change @xmath79 of the angular momentum of each pair ( at @xmath74 before the closing ) must be because of the quantization demand @xmath80 ( 2 ) .",
    "although the quantum formalism can not explain how this change of macroscopic number @xmath81 of pairs can be possible without any force , all experimental results testify to this force - free angular momentum transfer .",
    "consider the switching with a frequency @xmath82 of the whole ring between superconducting and normal states observed , for example , at the measurements of the critical current @xmath54 @xcite , see the section 2.3 . in the superconducting state",
    "the circular electrical current equals @xmath66 and the velocity of pairs @xmath83 because of the quantization ( 2,4 ) whereas in normal state @xmath65 and the average velocity @xmath74 .",
    "consequently the angular momentum of mobile charge carriers changes on @xmath84 at each switching in normal ( @xmath85 ) or superconducting ( @xmath86 ) state .",
    "the angular momentum of each electron pair @xmath87 changes on @xmath88 .",

    "the angular momentum of electron pair varies from @xmath93 to @xmath94 during a time @xmath95 in accordance with the relation @xmath96 after each transition into normal state .",
    "consequently the dissipation force on average in time @xmath97 may be described with the relation @xmath98 when the ring is switched with a frequency @xmath99 between superconducting and normal states .",
    "the experiments @xcite testify to a non - zero average value @xmath100 at @xmath23 and @xmath101 because of the predominant probability @xmath102 of the superconducting state with the same number @xmath12 at @xmath103 .",
    "the dissipation force @xmath104 , does not change the angular momentum of mobile charge carriers during a long time @xmath105 because the angular momentum must revert to the permitted value ( 2 ) at each return to superconducting state .",
    "this angular momentum change in a time unity @xmath106 compensates @xmath107 the one because of the dissipation force .",
    "the change of the pair momentum in a time unity @xmath108 because of the quantization ( 2 ) was called in @xcite quantum force .",
    "thus , the deduction of the quantum force in @xcite do not overstep the limits of the universally recognised quantum formalism and is based on experimental results .",
    "hirsch states that _ `` an azimuthal quantum force acting on electrons only would change the total angular momentum of the system , violating the physical principle of angular momentum conservation '' _ @xcite .",
    "it is not quite correct to say that the quantum force introduced in @xcite acts .",
    "this `` force '' ( 6 ) describes only momentum change in a time unity because of the quantization ( 2 ) observed at switching of a ring from normal to superconducting state or between superconducting states with different connectivity of the wave function , fig.1 .",
    "the angular momentum change @xmath109 of mobile charge carriers is observed at the transition into superconducting state with @xmath110 , for example in @xcite .",
    "the angular momentum change of the crystalline lattice of ions did not observed directly for the present .",
    "but we should think that the angular momentum of both mobile charge carriers and the crystalline lattice of ions should change at the transition into superconducting state as well as at the transition into normal state . therefore if it could be said that the quantum force acts then one should assume that it , as well as the dissipation force , acts both on mobile charge carriers and the crystalline lattice of ions .",
    "the azimuthal quantum force was introduced in @xcite in order to explain why the persistent current can not decay in spite of non - zero resistance .",
    "this paradoxical phenomenon was observed first in the little - parks experiment @xcite .",
    "the observations of the quantum oscillations of the resistance , @xmath111 @xcite and magnetic susceptibility @xmath112 @xcite give evidence that the persistent current can not decay in spite of non - zero resistance without the faraday electrical field @xmath113 .",
    "it is well known that an electrical current must rapidly decay @xmath114 in a ring with a resistance @xmath64 if magnetic flux inside the ring does not change in time @xmath115 .",
    "but the persistent current does not decay !      in order to explain this paradox it was taken into account in @xcite that the persistent current of superconducting pairs is observed at @xmath64 only in a narrow temperature region @xmath116 near superconducting transition .",
    "the resistance in this region is non - zero @xmath117 but lower than the ring resistance in the normal state @xmath118 because of the thermal fluctuations @xcite which switch ring segments between superconducting and normal states .",
    "the non - zero persistent current @xmath119 can be observed at @xmath117 because the values on average in time @xmath120 , @xmath121 are measured .",
    "the average resistance is not zero @xmath122 because of the switching , from time to time , of ring segments or the whole ring into the normal state and @xmath123 is observed because of the opposite switching into superconducting state with the discrete spectrum of permitted states , see fig.1 . below the fluctuation region , in superconducting state the resistance @xmath124 permanently and therefore the observations of the persistent current is not paradoxical whereas above this temperature region the persistent current of superconducting pairs is not observed .",
    "the electrical current decays @xmath61 because of energy dissipation during a time @xmath125 when the ring resistance @xmath126 .",

    "after this recurrence the current must revert to the permitted value @xmath131 ( 4 ) because of the quantization ( 2,3 ) .",
    "the angular momentum of mobile charge carriers changes from @xmath132 to @xmath133 because of energy dissipation and from @xmath133 to @xmath132 because of the quantization ( 2,3 ) .",

    "the quantum force is deduced from the fact of the momentum change because of the quantization ( 2 ) but it can not explain this paradoxical fact .",
