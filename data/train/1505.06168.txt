    "we introduce new mathematical techniques for analyzing complex spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamics and demonstrate their efficacy in problems from two different paradigms in hydrodynamics .",
    "our approach employs methods from algebraic topology ; earlier efforts have shown that computing the homology of topological spaces associated to scalar or vector fields generated by complex systems can provide new insights into dynamics @xcite .",
    "we extend prior work by using a relatively new tool called persistent homology @xcite .",
    "complex spatiotemporal systems often exhibit complicated pattern evolution .",
    "the patterns are given by scalar or vector fields representing the state of the system under study .",
    "persistent homology can be viewed as a map @xmath0 that assigns to every field a collection of points in @xmath1 , called a _ persistence diagram_. for a given scalar field @xmath2 , the points in the persistence diagram @xmath3 encode geometric features of the sub - level sets @xmath4 for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "a feature encoded by the point @xmath6 appears in @xmath7 for the first time and disappears in @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are called birth and death coordinates of this feature .",
    "the lifespan @xmath11 indicates the prominence of the feature . in particular",
    ", features with long lifespans are considered important and features with short lifespans are often associated with noise .",
    "thus , the persistence diagram is a highly simplified representation of the field generating the pattern .",
    "the space of all persistence diagrams , @xmath12 , can be endowed with a variety of metrics under which @xmath0 is a continuous function .",
    "this has several important implications that we exploit in this paper .",
    "first , continuity implies that small changes in the field pattern , e.g.  bounded errors associated with measurements or numerical approximations , lead to small changes in the persistence diagrams .",
    "second , by using different metrics , we can vary our focus of interest between larger and smaller changes in the persistence diagrams .",
    "moreover , by comparing different metrics , we can infer if the changes in a pattern affect geometric features with longer or shorter life spans . finally , since",
    ", applying the map @xmath0 to a time series of patterns produces a time series in @xmath12 , the distance between the consecutive data points in @xmath12 can be used to quantify the average rate at which the geometry of the patterns is changing .",
    "as mentioned above , the dynamics of spatiotemporal systems are characterized by the time - evolution of the patterns corresponding to the fields generated by the system . however , capturing these vector fields , either experimentally or numerically , results in multi - scale high dimensional data sets . in order to efficiently analyze these data sets ,",
    "a dimension reduction must be performed .",
    "we use persistent homology to perform nonlinear dimension reduction from a time series of patterns to a time series of persistence diagrams .",
    "we show that this reduction can cope with redundancies introduced by symmetries ( both discrete and continuous ) present in the system .",
    "in particular , this approach directly quotients out symmetries and , thereby , permits easy identification of solutions that lie on a group orbit .",
    "separately , we also apply persistent homology to extract information about dynamical structures in the reduced data . characterizing dynamics in the space of persistence diagrams",
    "can not be done using conventional methods ( e.g. , time delay embeddings ) , since choosing a coordinate system in @xmath12 is currently an open problem . however , since @xmath12 is a metric space , the geometry of the point cloud @xmath13 , generated by the time series of the reduced data , is encoded by a scalar field which assigns to each point in @xmath12 its distance to @xmath13 .",
    "we show how persistent homology may be applied to describe dynamics by characterizing the geometry of @xmath13 .",
    "an outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : systems ] we present a brief overview of the two fluid flows examined in this paper : ( 1 ) kolmogorov flow and ( 2 ) rayleigh - bnard convection .",
    "we note here , for emphasis , that while persistent homology can be applied to vector fields , it will be sufficient for this paper to focus on scalar fields drawn from these systems ( specifically , one component of the vorticity field for kolmogorov flow , and the temperature field for rayleigh - bnard convection ) .    in section  [ sec : ph * ]",
    "we discuss key issues related to the application of persistent homology . by now , the mathematical theory of persistent homology is well developed .",
    "therefore , our main emphasis is on the computational aspect of passing from the data to the persistence diagrams .",
    "section  [ sec : ph ] describes the correspondence between the geometric features of a scalar field and the points in its corresponding persistence diagram .",
    "section  [ sec : spaceofpd ] discusses the structure of the space @xmath12 and the properties of the associated metrics .    in sections  [ sec : distances ] and [ sec : analyzingpointcloud ] we discuss how these metrics can be used to analyze dynamics .",
    "first , we interpret distance between the persistence diagrams representing the consecutive data points in the time series as a rate at which geometry of the corresponding scalar fields is changing .",
    "second , we motivate and explain the procedure for extracting the geometric structure of the point cloud in @xmath12 .",
    "we close the paper by applying the developed techniques to the following problems . in section  [ sec : fixedpoints ] , we identify distinct classes of symmetry - related equilibria for kolomogorov flow . in section  [ sec : periodicorbit ] , we show that a relative periodic orbit for kolmogorov flow collapses to a closed loop in @xmath12 .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : rbc ] , we deal with identifying recurrent dynamics that occur on different time scales in our study of rayleigh - bnard convection flow .",
    "for the study of turbulence in two dimensions , kolmogorov proposed a model flow where the two - dimensional ( 2d ) velocity field @xmath14 is given by    @xmath15    ( with @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , where @xmath18 is the pressure field , @xmath19 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath20 is fluid density , and @xmath21 is the forcing that drives the flow @xcite .",
    "laboratory experiments in electromagnetically - driven shallow layers of electrolyte can exhibit flow dynamics that are well - described by equations ( [ eq : q2dns ] ) with appropriate choices of @xmath22 and @xmath23 to capture three - dimensional effects , which are commonly present in experiments @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we refer to all models described by equations ( [ eq : q2dns ] ) ( including experimentally - realistic versions ) as kolmogorov flows .",
    "it is convenient to use the vorticity - stream function formulation @xcite to study kolmogorov flow analytically and numerically .",
    "equations ( [ eq : q2dns ] ) , written in terms of the z - component of the vorticity field @xmath24 , a scalar field , take the form    @xmath25    for the current study , we choose @xmath26 , @xmath27 m@xmath28/s , @xmath29 s@xmath30 , @xmath31 kg / m@xmath32 , and @xmath33 m. we express the strength of the forcing in terms of a non - dimensional parameter , the reynolds number @xmath34 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : q2dvor_nd ] ) is solved numerically by using a pseudo - spectral method @xcite , assuming periodic boundary conditions in both @xmath35 and @xmath36 directions , i.e. , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 m and @xmath39 m are the dimensions of the domain in the @xmath35 and @xmath36 directions , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that equation ( [ eq : q2dvor_nd ] ) , with periodic boundary conditions , is invariant under any combination of three distinct coordinate transformations : ( 1 ) a translation along @xmath35 : @xmath40 , @xmath41 $ ] ; ( 2 ) a rotation by @xmath42 : @xmath43 ; and ( 3 ) a reflection and a shift : @xmath44 . because of these symmetries , each particular solution to equation ( [ eq : q2dvor_nd ] ) generates a set of solutions which are dynamically equivalent .",
    "physically , invariance under continuous translation leads to the existence of relative equilibria ( req ) and relative periodic orbit ( rpo ) solutions , in addition to equilibria ( eq ) and periodic orbit ( po ) solutions .",
    "for @xmath45 , the flow is characterized by a steady rpo ; figure [ fig : projections](a ) shows a projection , plotted using the three dominant fourier modes of this rpo .",
    "the rpo has a period 34.78 seconds and a drift speed @xmath46 m / s .",
    "the tunnel - like structure is a result of the periodic motion superposed over the slow drift along the @xmath35-direction . for larger",
    "forcing ( @xmath47 ) , the flow becomes weakly turbulent , as can be seen from the fourier projections in figure [ fig : projections](b ) .",
    "the turbulent dynamics in this regime are of great interest as the flow explores a region of the state space which contains  weakly \" unstable eq , po , req , and rpo solutions .",
    "recent theoretical advances have shown that the identification of these solutions could aid the understanding of weakly turbulent dynamics @xcite .",
    "for instance , if the turbulent trajectory is close to an eq solution ( @xmath48 ) , which is characterized by @xmath49 , we would expect the instantaneous rate of change of @xmath50 to be relatively small , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "similarly , a close pass to a po solution would mean @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the period of the po that is guiding the dynamics of the turbulent trajectory .",
    "the turbulent trajectory depicted in figure [ fig : projections](b ) passes close to unstable eq and req solutions which are indicated by the red dots .",
    "rayleigh - bnard convection is a canonical pattern forming system that has been used to gain many new fundamental insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of systems that are driven far - from - equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "rayleigh - bnard convection is the buoyancy driven fluid flow that occurs when a shallow layer of fluid is heated uniformly from below in a gravitational field .",
    "the dynamics are governed by the boussinesq equations , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a vector field of the fluid velocity , @xmath56 is the pressure field , and @xmath57 is the temperature field . in our notation ,",
    "the origin of the cartesian coordinates @xmath58 at the center of the domain are at the lower heated plate where @xmath59 is a unit vector opposing gravity .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : rbc1])-([eq : rbc3 ] ) represent the conservation of momentum , energy , and mass , respectively .",
    "the equations have been nondimensionalized using the vertical diffusion time of heat as the time scale , the layer depth as the length scale , and the constant temperature difference between the lower and upper plates as the temperature scale .    in our work ,",
    "we consider rayleigh - bnard convection in a shallow domain with a cylindrical cross - section .",
    "the no - slip fluid boundary condition @xmath60 is applied to all material surfaces .",
    "the lower and upper plates are held at a constant temperature where @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "the lateral sidewalls of the cylindrical container are assumed to be perfectly conducting , which yields @xmath63 .",
    "the dynamics can be described using three non - dimensional parameters .",
    "the rayleigh number @xmath64 represents the ratio of buoyancy to viscous forces . at the critical value @xmath65 , an infinite layer of fluid undergoes a bifurcation to straight and parallel convection rolls . for increasing values of the rayleigh number @xmath66 , the dynamics become periodic , chaotic , and eventually turbulent .",
    "the prandtl number @xmath67 is the ratio of the momentum and thermal diffusivities . for typical experiments using compressed gasses , @xmath68 .",
    "lastly , the aspect ratio of the cylindrical domain @xmath69 is the ratio of the domain s radius to its depth .",
    "we numerically integrate eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rbc1])-([eq : rbc3 ] ) using a highly parallel spectral element algorithm that has been tailored for the study of convection ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : klf](b ) shows a typical pattern from a numerical simulation of rayleigh - bnard convection . in this simulation , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and",
    "the aspect ratio of the domain is @xmath72 .",
    "the numerical simulation is initiated from a field of small random perturbations to the temperature field and is integrated for long times .",
    "figure  [ fig : klf](b ) illustrates the fluid temperature field at the horizontal mid - plane ( @xmath73 ) , where light is warm rising fluid and dark is cool falling fluid . this image is a snap shot in time of a time - dependent pattern where the dynamics are nearly periodic in time .",
    "the pattern shown does not include the region near the sidewall .",
    "specifically , a distance of one - layer depth from the lateral sidewall is not shown ( this distance is approximately the width of a convection roll ) .",
    "this is done to remove the complex fluid flow that occurs in the small region near the sidewalls to allow our diagnostics to focus upon the bulk patterns and dynamics ( c.f .",
    "the aim of this paper is to introduce an approach for analyzing the dynamics of the pattern evolution in spatiotemporal systems .",
    "this is done in two steps .",
    "first , we perform nonlinear data reduction , and then we extract information about the dynamical structures from this reduced data . we formulate both of these tasks in terms of analyzing the structure of the sub - level sets of a scalar function @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a topological space .",
    "tools from algebraic topology , homology in particular , are used to capture and quantify the geometry of the sub - level sets .",
    "recall that given any topological space @xmath76 , homology assigns to @xmath76 a sequence of vector spaces @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath77 is called the @xmath79-th _ betti number _ and is denoted by @xmath80 .",
    "betti numbers provide geometric information about @xmath13 : @xmath81 is the number of connected components , or pieces , of @xmath76 ; @xmath82 indicates the number of loops or tunnels in @xmath76 ; and @xmath83 is the number of cavities .",
    "our goal is to understand structure of the sub - level sets @xmath84 for all values of @xmath85 . as we vary @xmath5 , the number of components , loops , and cavities in @xmath86 changes , implying that @xmath87 , @xmath88 , also changes .",
    "( see section  [ sec : ph ] for examples . )",
    "what is remarkable is that , under very weak conditions , we can choose bases for the vector spaces @xmath89 over all values of @xmath5 such that , given a basis element of @xmath89 , we can identify a unique value @xmath9 at which this basis element appears and a unique value @xmath10 at which this basis element disappears .",
    "we refer to @xmath9 as the _ birth value _ , @xmath10 as the _ death value _ , and the pair @xmath90 as a _ persistence point _ corresponding to the chosen basis element of @xmath89 .",
    "the difference @xmath91 is called the _ life span _ of the persistence point .",
    "longer life spans are associated with geometric features that persist through larger variations of @xmath5 , and persistence diagrams are a codification of this information . given a scalar field @xmath92 , the set of associated _ persistence diagrams _ are denoted by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 consists of all persistence points corresponding to the @xmath79-th level of homology ( keeping track of multiple copies of a single point ) , along with infinitely many points at each point along the diagonal @xmath95 .",
    "the reason for the inclusion of the diagonal is made clear in definition  [ defn : bottleneck ] , when we define metrics on the space of persistence diagrams .",
    "for the systems introduced in section  [ sec : systems ] , we first use persistent homology as a nonlinear data reduction method .",
    "for kolmogorov flow we study the scalar field @xmath96 , the @xmath97-component of the vorticity field , while for rayleigh - bnard convection we study the scalar field @xmath98 , the temperature field at the mid - plane .",
    "it is important to note that the domains for these two scalar fields are different . for kolmogorov flow ,",
    "the domain @xmath75 is a torus since we are using periodic boundary conditions , while for rayleigh - bnard convection , @xmath75 is a disk . for the disk ,",
    "we need only to concern ourselves with the vector spaces @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "however , for the torus , the vector spaces @xmath101 also need to be considered , since the torus encloses a three - dimensional cavity . in section  [ sec : ph ] , we explain how the persistence diagrams @xmath3 capture important information about the patterns given by the scalar fields @xmath50 and @xmath53 .",
    "the set of all persistence diagrams @xmath0 is a metric space , denoted by @xmath12 ( see section  [ sec : spaceofpd ] ) .",
    "since we are studying the evolution of kolmogorov flow and rayleigh - bnard convection , we have time series of the vorticity @xmath102 and temperature @xmath103 fields , and , therefore , we have time series of persistence diagrams @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we view each of these time series as a point cloud @xmath106 . to extract information about dynamical structures present in the time series , we use persistent homology a second time to quantify the geometry associated with this point cloud .",
    "this is achieved by introducing a new scalar function @xmath107 that gives the distance from any point in @xmath12 to the point cloud @xmath13 and is defined by @xmath108 where @xmath109 is an appropriate metric on the space of persistence diagrams .",
    "the associated sub - level sets @xmath86 are once again given by .",
    "to carry out the steps mentioned above requires the ability to compute the persistence diagrams @xmath3 . to do this",
    ", we need to calculate @xmath89 , which requires a discrete representation of @xmath86 called a _",
    "complex_. in the context of nonlinear data reduction , we make use of a _ cubical _ complex . when analyzing the geometry of the point cloud , we approximate @xmath86 using a _ vietoris - rips _ complex , which is a special form of a simplicial complex .",
    "this is a classical subject and thus there are a variety of references providing precise definitions of complexes , e.g. @xcite for vietoris - rips complexes and @xcite for cubical complexes , discussions of issues related to approximations @xcite , and how one proceeds from a complex to computing persistent homology @xcite .",
    "the homological computations in this paper were performed using the perseus software @xcite .",
    "the numerical data for the vorticity and the temperature fields is presented in the form of piecewise - constant functions defined on a rectangular lattice .",
    "for kolmogorov flow , values of @xmath50 are reported in double precision .",
    "recall that the vector spaces @xmath99 can only change for @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the finite set of values that @xmath50 attains on the given lattice .",
    "each of the sets @xmath112 is a cubical complex , and we use the perseus software to compute the corresponding persistence diagrams using only the values @xmath110 . numerical simulations for rayleigh - bnard convection are carried out with high precision as well .",
    "however , keeping in mind our goal to compare the numerical simulations with experimental data , we convert the temperature field to an @xmath113-bit temperature field @xmath114 ( an integer - valued function with values between @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) , which can be obtained experimentally . consequences of this rescaling are examined in section  [ sec : distances ] .",
    "the purpose of this section is to provide intuition and interpretation of the information that persistence diagrams present .",
    "as indicated in the previous section , we are interested in the diagrams @xmath117 , @xmath118 , of the vorticity field for kolmogorov flow , and the diagrams @xmath119 , @xmath120 of the temperature field for rayleigh - bnard convection , shown in figure  [ fig : klf ] .",
    "+   +   +    we begin by discussing @xmath121 , shown in figure  [ fig : pds_kolmogorov](e ) , computed from a single time snapshot of the vorticity field for the kolmogorov flow .",
    "the minimum value of the vorticity field is @xmath122 , and therefore , @xmath123 for all @xmath124 . at @xmath125 ,",
    "two components appear , indicated by the two persistence points with birth value @xmath126 .",
    "the death value of one of these two persistence points is @xmath127 , and so the two components merge at this value , resulting in a single component .",
    "this explains the persistence point @xmath128 .",
    "the reason the other persistence point is denoted by @xmath129 , with @xmath130 , is because when features merge , a choice must be made about which topological feature ( in this case , a connected component ) dies .",
    "having a consistent choice of basis over all values of @xmath5 requires that the homology generator associated with the geometric feature that has the larger birth value die first . if the birth values are the same , then it does not matter which topological feature with this birth value is chosen to be the one that persists .",
    "in particular , this implies that the generator associated with one of these two initial components can never die .",
    "figure  [ fig : pds_kolmogorov](a ) indicates the subset of @xmath75 corresponding to @xmath131 .",
    "we remind the reader that the domain @xmath75 for kolmogorov flow is a torus , since the left ( top ) and right ( bottom ) boundaries are identified . therefore , @xmath131 consists of eight distinct connected components instead of nine .",
    "the existence of these eight connected components can also be extracted from @xmath121 , shown in figure  [ fig : pds_kolmogorov](e ) .",
    "observe that these connected components correspond to connected regions with birth value @xmath132 and death value @xmath133 . in figure",
    "[ fig : pds_kolmogorov](e ) , this corresponds to the eight points in the rectangular region @xmath134 .",
    "figure  [ fig : pds_kolmogorov](b ) indicates that @xmath135 consists of four connected horizontal bands , which agrees with the number of persistence points in the rectangular region @xmath136 of @xmath121 .",
    "each stripe is created as two distinct components present in figure  [ fig : pds_kolmogorov](a ) grow and merge , causing one component to die each time .",
    "the deaths of these components are captured by the points in the rectangle @xmath137 which are not in the rectangle @xmath138 , since these are components that are born before @xmath139 but die before @xmath140 .",
    "three horizontal stripes merge together before @xmath141 , as indicated by two points inside the rectangle @xmath137 that are not in the rectangle @xmath142 .",
    "the two remaining connected components merge together soon thereafter , and for all greater threshold values , there is only one connected component .    to finish our analysis of @xmath121 , we turn our attention to the persistence points close to the diagonal .",
    "these have very short life spans , which suggests that these features may be numerical artifacts . in our example , these points represent the narrow horizontal bands formed in between two connected components before they merge into a single band ( see video 1 available in the supplementary materials ) .",
    "these narrow bands are formed by small oscillations of the vorticity field at the places where the field is almost constant .",
    "we now turn our attention to the @xmath143 persistence diagram , which characterizes loops in @xmath112 .",
    "appendix  [ sec : homologyoftorus ] provides a detailed discussion of independent loops on a torus . from @xmath143 , we see that the first loop appears at threshold @xmath144 .",
    "it corresponds to one of the four horizontal bands shown in figure  [ fig : pds_kolmogorov](b ) .",
    "each horizontal band generates a single independent loop , corroborated by the existence of four persistence points in the rectangle @xmath138 of @xmath143 .",
    "we note that the full torus has two loops captured by homology .",
    "this is expressed in @xmath143 by the two persistence points with @xmath130 .",
    "observe that the first loop that appears at @xmath144 is equivalent to one of the toral loops , thus it can not be killed by any other loop , and hence is captured by the persistence point @xmath145 .",
    "the other three loops present at @xmath140 correspond to the same toral loop and thus must die .",
    "in fact , they do so by @xmath146 .",
    "note that the birth values @xmath9 of these persistence points are close to the death values @xmath10 of the persistence points in @xmath147 of @xmath121 .",
    "this implies that shortly after the components merge , they form horizontal bands across the entire domain .",
    "new loops are also created as the bands start merging .",
    "if two horizontal bands are connected by @xmath148 links , then the number of loops generated by this object ( two bands plus the links ) is @xmath149 .",
    "thus , the first additional loop appears when a second link is created ( see appendix  [ sec : homologyoftorus ] ) . in our example",
    ", this happens near the threshold @xmath150 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pds_kolmogorov](c ) , there are four distinct links between the two horizontal bands at the top of the figure .",
    "the small punctures visible in figure  [ fig : pds_kolmogorov](c ) are filled in almost immediately , and the four links merge into two distinct links .",
    "the points in @xmath143 that are close to the diagonal capture this behavior .",
    "the other two links are present for a wider range of thresholds , and the loop they generate is represented by one of the persistence points in @xmath143 with birth coordinate slightly smaller than @xmath151 .",
    "the horizontal band at the top and the horizontal band at the bottom are linked in a similar fashion .",
    "this explains the presence of another point with birth coordinate slightly smaller than @xmath151 .    at @xmath152 , a connection from the top to the bottom boundary",
    "is created .",
    "this loop is homologically equivalent to the second of the two independent loops of the torus , and hence is identified by the persistence point @xmath153 . as the threshold passes the value @xmath154 , the punctures shown in figure  [ fig : pds_kolmogorov](d ) start disappearing and the corresponding loops start dying .",
    "again , there are @xmath155 independent loops for @xmath156 punctures .",
    "since the maximum value of @xmath50 is @xmath157 , the sub - level set is the whole torus for any threshold above this , i.e.  @xmath158 for all @xmath159 . in this case , there are no more punctures , and the rectangle @xmath160 contains only two persistence points .    finally , we address the @xmath161 persistence diagram , not shown for brevity .",
    "this diagram contains a single persistence point at @xmath162 .",
    "the birth coordinate , @xmath9 , corresponds to the minimum value of @xmath5 for which @xmath163 , the whole torus . since @xmath163 for all @xmath164 , this point never dies .",
    "we now discuss the persistence diagrams for the temperature field @xmath114 shown in figure  [ fig : pds_panam ] for rayleigh - bnard convection .",
    "again , beginning with @xmath165 , the points with short life spans correspond the large number of small connected components that make up @xmath166 , as shown in figure  [ fig : pds_panam](a ) .",
    "points with long life spans represent the well - defined connected components shown in figure  [ fig : pds_panam](b ) . from the persistence diagram , we can see that these components merge almost simultaneously at two threshold values , @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "turning to @xmath169 , we note that the domain of the temperature field is a disk , so the independent loops correspond to punctures inside of the disk .",
    "the diagram @xmath169 indicates that there are no loops with long life spans , and the loops that do appear do so roughly at the same threshold values at which the dominant components merge .",
    "these features are due to the small fluctuations of the temperature field close to the critical values at which different rolls merge together .",
    "this is consistent with their short life spans .",
    "as explained in the previous section , a persistence diagram codifies , in a reasonably compact form , considerable information about the geometry of a scalar function . as suggested by the examples , we use persistence diagrams to provide a reduced description of the state of the dynamical system of interest at any given point in time .",
    "therefore , to analyze the dynamics , we need to be able to compare one collection of persistence diagrams @xmath0 ( corresponding to a snapshot of the flow pattern at an instant of time ) to another collection of diagrams @xmath170 ( from another flow snapshot ) .",
    "there are a variety of metrics that can be imposed on persistence diagrams @xcite .",
    "the metrics used in this paper rely on pairing the points @xmath171 in a one - to - one correspondence ( bijection ) with the points in @xmath172 .",
    "according to the definition , every persistence diagram contains an infinite number of copies of the diagonal .",
    "hence , there are many different bijections @xmath173 between @xmath174 and @xmath172 . roughly speaking",
    ", the distance between @xmath0 and @xmath170 is defined using the bijections that `` minimize the shift '' in the mapping of the points @xmath175 from @xmath174 to @xmath176 in @xmath172 .",
    "this notion is made more precise in the following definition .",

    "in particular , if @xmath191 , then @xmath192    these results on lipschitz continuity have two important implications for this work , both stemming from the fact that our analysis is based on numerical simulations .",

    "ideally , we want to understand @xmath3 .",
    "our computations of persistent homology are based on @xmath193 , a cubical complex defined in terms of the numerically - reported values @xmath194 , where @xmath195 represents the associated piecewise - constant function .",
    "if the numerical approximation @xmath195 satisfies @xmath196 , then by we have a bound on the bottleneck distance between the actual persistence diagram @xmath3 and the computed persistence diagram @xmath197 , so that @xmath198 .",
    "figure  [ fig : bottleneck ] provides a schematic justification of this claim .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , persistent homology is invariant under certain continuous deformations of the domain . to be more precise , if @xmath199 is a homeomorphism and @xmath188 , then @xmath200 .",
    "of particular relevance to this paper is a function @xmath201 which arises as a symmetric action on the domain . in this paper",
    ", we work with piecewise - constant numerical approximations of the actual functions of interest , and we can not assume that this equality holds .",
    "however , if @xmath92 is given and @xmath202 , where @xmath201 is as above , and we have an @xmath189 bound @xmath203 on the difference between the approximation and the true function , then by , @xmath204 in summary , under the assumption of bounded noise or errors from numerical simulations ( or experimental data ) , we have explicit control of the errors of the distances in @xmath12 .",
    "the goal of this section is twofold : one , to provide intuition about the information contained in the different metrics , and two , to suggest how viewing a time series in @xmath12 can provide insight into the underlying dynamics .",
    "we begin by remarking that the bottleneck distance @xmath205 measures only the single largest difference between the persistence diagrams and ignores the rest .",
    "the wasserstein distance @xmath206 includes all differences between the diagrams .",
    "thus , it is always true that @xmath207 the sensitivity of the wasserstein metric to small differences ( possibly due to noise ) can be modulated by the choice of the value of @xmath175 , i.e.  if @xmath208 , then one expects @xmath206 to be less sensitive to small changes than @xmath209 . in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the bottleneck distance @xmath205 and the wasserstein distances @xmath206 for @xmath210 .",
    "the most obvious use of these metrics is to identify or distinguish patterns . as an example , we consider patterns along an orbit from the kolmogorov flow . as indicated in section  [ intro_kolmogorov ] , this particular trajectory arises from a periodic orbit with a slow drift along an orbit of continuous symmetry .",
    "in particular , we consider the three time points indicated in figure  [ fig : projections](a ) : two that appear to differ by the continuous symmetry , and a third that lies on the ` opposite ' side of the periodic orbit",
    ". plots of the associated vorticity fields at these points ( see figure  [ fig:3states ] ) agree with this characterization of the time points .",
    "we want to identify this information through the associated persistence diagrams @xmath211 , @xmath212 , and @xmath213 , shown in figure  [ fig:3statesdiagram ] .",
    "indeed , the plots of @xmath214 and @xmath215 are difficult to distinguish , but @xmath216 is clearly distinct . to quantify this difference , we make use of the distances between the persistence diagrams using @xmath205 , @xmath217 , and @xmath218 .",

    "as mentioned in section  [ sec::largedata ] , characterizing the geometry of a continuous trajectory becomes a challenge in the setting of dynamics with multiple time scales . to demonstrate this",
    ", we consider the numerical simulation of rayleigh - bnard convection , where from multiple perspectives it appears that the trajectory is close to a periodic orbit and that the rate of change in the patterns of the temperature field is far from constant .",
    "this can be clearly seen visually ( see video 6 , 7 , or 8 in the supplementary materials ) . moreover , both the speed plot , figure  [ fig : consecdist](b ) , and the distance matrix , figure  [ fig : distancematrixperiodicorbit](b ) , suggest recurrent dynamics . however , we note that the rate of change , especially using the bottleneck distance , is typically small except for short periods of time at which the speed spikes .",
    "the distance matrix has a distinct checkerboard pattern , with the edges corresponding to the spikes , again indicating a rapid and large change in location in the space of persistence diagrams .",
    "the maximum bottleneck distance between the consecutive sampling points is @xmath224 ( figure  [ fig : consecdist](b ) caption ) , while the diameter of the point cloud is only @xmath225 ( figure  [ fig : distancematrixperiodicorbit](b ) ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that significant portions of the trajectory are missing .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig : persistencediagramsrbc500](a ) shows that there are several persistence points in @xmath226 with a ( finite ) death coordinate larger than ten .",
    "thus , at a length scale of @xmath227 ( which is forty times larger than the noise threshold ) , the sample of the trajectory is broken into several pieces .",
    "the largest gap between different pieces of the trajectory is @xmath228 , as indicated by the persistence point with coordinates @xmath229 .",
    "this means that the sampling rate is far from adequate .",
    "the diagram @xmath230 in figure  [ fig : persistencediagramsrbc500](b ) contains a single dominant point at @xmath231 with life span @xmath232 .",
    "however , unlike in our analysis of the kolmogorov flow in the previous section , we can not argue that this point corresponds to a single dominant loop along which the data is organized because of the gaps in the sampling of the orbit . as mentioned in section  [ sec::largedata ]",
    ", the missing parts of the orbit could introduce loops of similar size corresponding to secondary structures .",
    "these structures might occur due to the fact that the loop corresponding to the underlying almost - periodic dynamics might be twisted , pinched , or bent in @xmath12 . in order to obtain information about secondary structures",
    ", we require a faster sampling rate .    we increased the sampling rate considerably and collected approximately @xmath233 equally - spaced snapshots of the temperature field over four - and - a - half periods and compute the associated persistence diagrams , producing a point cloud @xmath234 .",
    "the maximal distances between the consecutive frames for the increased sampling rate drop to @xmath235 , @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "the new value of @xmath205 is much closer to our estimate of the numerical error and it is more than 24 times smaller than the diameter of the point cloud generated from the slower sampling .",
    "since the point cloud could only increase in diameter through increasing the sample rate , we consider this sampling rate to be satisfactory .",
    "our next step is to use the ideas introduced in section  [ sec::largedata ] to reduce the size of the sample and to complete our analysis .",
    "first we construct a @xmath238-dense , @xmath238-sparse subsample @xmath239 of the point cloud @xmath240 .",
    "the smallest value of @xmath238 for which we were able to compute the persistence diagrams @xmath241 , using @xmath242 gb of memory , is @xmath243 .",
    "this value is only slightly larger than the largest distance between the consecutive states and , since the diameter of the subsampled point cloud is @xmath244 , the relationship between the length scale of the smallest detectable feature and the length scale of the diameter of the point cloud is still sufficient to resolve the geometry of the dynamics .",
    "the resulting persistence diagrams @xmath241 are shown in figure  [ fig : persistencediagramsrbc ] .",
    "as shown by @xmath245 , figure  [ fig : persistencediagramsrbc](a ) , the point cloud merges to a single connected component at @xmath246 .",
    "this indicates that the sample of the trajectory is not broken into different pieces separated from each other .",
    "since the maximum consecutive distance between any two points in @xmath240 is @xmath247 , the loop along which the data is organized should be present for @xmath248 .",
    "however , after subsampling , it is possible that the loop will not be born until @xmath249 . looking at the diagram @xmath250 in figure  [ fig : persistencediagramsrbc](b ) , we see that it contains a dominant point at @xmath251 , and so the loop was indeed born before @xmath249 .",
    "this is the loop along which the point cloud is organized .",
    "now , there is another point , @xmath252 , with life span @xmath253 .",
    "this point corresponds to a secondary structure of the orbit .",
    "indeed , it can be seen from the distance matrix for the @xmath238-sparse , @xmath238-dense subsample ( not shown for brevity ) that the part of the orbit corresponding to the fast dynamics ( missing for the slow sampling rate ) revisits very similar states before continuing along the main loop .",
    "however , the development of more sensitive tools is required to fully understand these secondary features .",
    "we now turn our attention to the differences between the persistence diagrams of the original point cloud @xmath240 and its subsample @xmath254 .",
    "theorem  [ thm::subsample ] implies that @xmath255 , and so there exists a bijection between the points in @xmath256 and @xmath241 such that the distance between matched points is less than @xmath257 . according to remark  [ rem::subsample ] , for the dominant point @xmath258",
    ", there is exactly one corresponding point in @xmath259 .",
    "this point is the unique point in @xmath259 that lies inside of the shaded box touching the point @xmath251 , see figure  [ fig : persistencediagramsrbc](b ) .",
    "the same is true for the other dominant point .",
    "moreover , there are no points in @xmath259 outside of the shaded regions .",
    "points in @xmath259 that do not correspond to the off - diagonal points in @xmath250 can appear only @xmath260 far away from the diagonal .",
    "we have shown how persistent homology can be used to identify equilibria and study periodic dynamics , and how this method is particularly natural when solutions must be identified that lie on a group orbit .",
    "we study two regimes in kolmogorov flow : chaotic dynamics due to the appearance of unstable fixed points , and a periodic flow that exhibits drift in a direction of continuous symmetry .",
    "we also study an almost - periodic orbit from rayleigh - bnard convection .",
    "we solve for the unstable equilibria in the first case and sample the periodic orbits in the other two cases , and use persistent homology to project these solutions to the space of persistence diagrams .",
    "we provide theoretical results that show this projection is stable with respect to numerical errors and discuss how the projection naturally identifies symmetry - related solutions .",
    "we give three different metrics on the space of persistence diagrams that can be used to study pattern evolution on large versus small spatial scales , and how these metrics can be used to estimate numerical error in the space of persistence diagrams .",
    "we develop an intuition for studying dynamics in the space of persistence diagrams by looking at point clouds in two - dimensional euclidean space , and discuss methods for determining if a continuous trajectory has been sampled densely enough to resolve the underlying dynamics , as well as mathematical methods used to address issues associated with computing on large sample sets .",
    "we demonstrate the efficacy of these methods on kolmogorov flow and rayleigh - bnard convection , comparing our methods to traditional fourier methods where appropriate .",
    "our results show that the geometry of the dynamics are recovered in each case . for rayleigh - bnard convection in particular",
    ", we show that the dynamics are recovered even after truncating the simulated data to an 8-bit temperature field , and so this approach is suitable for studying data collected experimentally , rather than numerically .",
    "also for this flow , we recover more subtle aspects of the geometry in the space of persistence diagrams . in summary",
    ", we have shown that this method is both robust to noise and sensitive to more complicated dynamics , and that it is appropriate for studying dynamics on datasets obtained experimentally .",
    "our ongoing research will further refine these tools .",

    "note that @xmath289 for @xmath290 , and the sets can be considered as sub - level sets of some scalar function @xmath92 .",
    "we will now examine each set and identify the independent loops in each .",
    "the set @xmath292 can not be contracted to a point .",
    "it forms a band that wraps around the torus .",
    "there are many different loops ( wrapping once around the torus from left to right in the picture ) inside of this band .",
    "however , we can choose a single loop @xmath279 that represents all of them ; every other loop can be either continuously deformed to a linear combination of the loop @xmath279 , or contracted to a point .",
    "similarly , the set @xmath293 contains two independent loops .",
    "the set @xmath294 is formed by linking the horizontal bands present in @xmath293 . the loops @xmath279 and @xmath280 are still independent in @xmath294 ( one can not be deformed to the other inside @xmath294 ) .",
    "it might seem that there is a new independent loop , @xmath173 .",
    "however , this is not case because @xmath173 can be deformed ( inside of @xmath294 ) to the union of the black lines corresponding to @xmath295 and @xmath238 . after this deformation",
    ", the loop traverses @xmath238 twice : the right part of the deformed loop traverses @xmath238 from the top to the bottom , and the left part in the opposite direction .",
    "algebraically , the deformed loop can be expressed as @xmath296 .",
    "this shows that @xmath173 can be deformed to a linear combination of the loops @xmath279 and @xmath280 .",
    "thus , @xmath173 is not a new independent loop .",
    "the set @xmath297 , obtained from @xmath294 by adding another link between the horizontal bands , contains a new independent loop , @xmath298 , consisting of the edges @xmath299 and @xmath300 ( @xmath301 ) .",
    "this means that the loop @xmath298 can not be deformed inside of @xmath297 to a linear combination of the loops @xmath279 and @xmath280 . again , the loop @xmath173 is not independent from @xmath279 , @xmath280 , and @xmath298 because it can be perturbed to @xmath302 , which is a linear combination of the loops @xmath295 , and @xmath298 .",
