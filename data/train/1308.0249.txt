    "let us start assuming that two point particles with masses @xmath1 and @xmath2 located at positions @xmath3 and @xmath4 attract each other with a force @xmath5 :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is newton s constant and @xmath9 is a free positive physical constant with dimensions m@xmath10l@xmath11t@xmath12 .",
    "this law of attraction has been considered , more or less directly , as a candidate to solve what is known today as the dark mass problem ( more on that below ) .    in considering this new law of force",
    "it is important to keep in mind that space has three dimensions and not two , and as a consequence of this only the newtonian component of ( [ force ] ) is solenoidal .    since : @xmath13 introducing the potential function @xmath14 defined by :    @xmath15    from ( [ force ] ) there follows that :    @xmath16    let us assume that the point particle with mass @xmath2 is kept fixed at the location @xmath4 and that the particle @xmath1 is free to move under its attraction .",
    "this simple formula above tells us that this particle will move without friction as it would do across a cloud of dark matter with an always positive effective density @xmath17 , while obeying a potential theory formally identical to newton s one .",
    "if instead of a point particle with mass @xmath2 we consider a continuous distribution of mass with density @xmath18 then we shall have :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the domain where @xmath21 , and :",
    "@xmath22    from where we get :    @xmath23    let us consider in particular the case where the density @xmath24 is constant inside a sphere of radius @xmath25 and zero otherwise ( figure 1 ) . in this case",
    ", @xmath26 being now @xmath27 , the effective density @xmath17 will be :    @xmath28    @xmath29 being the heaviside function ; or :    @xmath30    with :    @xmath31    from where , to calculate the central potential or the force , we could proceed as usual integrating the poisson s equation ( [ extended ] ) , or use their corresponding integral definitions .",
    "if instead we have an spherical sector with inner radius @xmath32 ( figure 2 ) then the effective density @xmath33 is :    @xmath34    notice that in the cavity defined by @xmath35 , where the raw matter density is zero , the effective density remains positive and therefore the force remains attractive towards the center .",
    "this means that it is a legitimate speculation to point out that if gravity includes a contribution of the type that i have considered here , then we could sometimes be fooled to believe that a massive object gravitates around a source that actually does not exists at all .",
    "notable consequences of the proposed new law are :    \\i ) if @xmath36 and there is ordinary matter somewhere then there is dark matter everywhere .",
    "therefore this new law has a lot to say about the rotation curves of spiral galaxies as well as micro and macro lensing .",
    "the price that we pay for it is the non locality of the theory since the effective density is not a point function .",
    "\\ii ) it predicts new surprising effects like massive bodies orbiting central un - existing matter sources in empty cavities ( empty cavity effect ) , and beyond that it promises an interesting development of the physics of voids in cosmology ..",
    "\\iii ) last but not least , the transport of this proposal to general relativity is quite natural .",
    "it suffices to use the effective density @xmath37 instead of the pure matter one @xmath24 in the source energy - momentum tensor of einstein s equations .",
    "the first conceptually important implications are : 1 ) that the gravitational field of a point particle becomes more singular than what it is in einstein s theory and 2 ) that , so to speak , all exact vacuum solutions become approximate approximate solutions of the modified theory . on the other hand cosmology only needs to sort out what part of the total density is matter density and what part it is dark matter .",
    "they claim that this potential can be approximated by a @xmath40 or a @xmath0 one depending on the scale of distances .",
    "they also note `` that from a dynamical point of view the modification of the newton s law of gravity can be interpreted as if point sources lose their point - like character and acquire an additional distribution in space '' .",
    "this is also the main point in my very much simpler proposition .",
    "reference @xcite starts with the introduction of the potential function ( [ mu ] ) but the only source model that is considered is that of a thin disk of matter that can be dealt with in the framework of potential theory in dimension 2 .",
