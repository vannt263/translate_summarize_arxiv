    "in recent years a significant theoretical effort has been directed toward understanding the origin and the interesting properties of transverse spin asymmetries observed in high - energy scattering experiments . the _ single transverse spin asymmetry _ ( stsa ) in polarized scattering @xmath5 is an observable describing the correlation between the transverse spin vector @xmath6 of the projectile @xmath7 and the transverse momentum @xmath8 of the produced hadron @xmath9 .",
    "this correlation can be expressed either in terms of the asymmetry in the scattering of the spin - up and spin - down transverse spin states , or in terms of the `` left - right '' ( @xmath10 ) asymmetric momentum distribution in spin - up scattering : @xmath11 interpreted as a left - right asymmetry in the produced hadron distribution , the sign of @xmath12 is fixed to reflect a preferential scattering of particles to the beam - left when @xmath12 is positive and a preferential scattering to the beam - right when @xmath12 is negative . more concretely , if the polarized projectile moves along the @xmath13 axis and the transverse spin is oriented along the @xmath14 axis , then positive @xmath12 corresponds to more outgoing particles produced along the @xmath15 axis than along the @xmath16 axis .",
    "the geometry of polarized scattering is illustrated in .",
    "the stsa can also be thought of as a spin - momentum coupling term proportional to @xmath17 in the particle production cross section , where @xmath18 is the momentum of the incoming projectile . for a review of the current status of stsa physics",

    "qualitatively , the asymmetries were consistent with zero for mid rapidities , but increased rapidly in the forward scattering direction , as illustrated by the data shown in the left panel of .",
    "more recently , the phenix , star , and brahms collaborations at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) have studied transverse spin asymmetries over a wide kinematic range at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the data they have presented @xcite confirmed and extended the fermilab results , and also indicated a non - monotonic dependence of stsa on the transverse momentum @xmath3 of the produced hadron @xcite , shown in the right panel of .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     at the time these spin asymmetries",
    "were first observed , there was no theoretical framework to understand them ; on the contrary , prevailing wisdom expected spin - dependent effects to become negligible at high energies @xcite .",
    "much theoretical progress in classifying and modeling sources of stsa has been made since then , predominantly within the framework of collinear factorization .",
    "there are three stages in the scattering process where an asymmetry could be generated , illustrated in .",
    "sivers @xcite proposed the existence of a correlation between the spin of the polarized hadron and the transverse momentum distribution of its partons .",
    "this sivers effect would act within the parton distribution function ( pdf ) ( or , equivalently , the initial state wave function ) of the polarized projectile to generate an asymmetry .",
    "being a part of the pdf , this is an intrinsically non - perturbative process .",
    "the asymmetry could also be generated in the partonic scattering processes themselves ; since the leading - order scattering process does not generate an asymmetry , any contribution would come from `` higher - twist '' terms in the interaction , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "such an asymmetry generated by the interaction may be perturbative , depending on the kinematics .",
    "finally , collins @xcite proposed a similar correlation between spin and transverse momentum that could occur during hadronization , as a produced parton undergoes fragmentation into final - state hadrons .",
    "the collins effect would couple the spin of a produced parton to the momentum dependence of its fragmentation function , resulting in a left - right asymmetry within the final - state jet .",
    "again , the collins effect is a low - energy , intrinsically non - perturbative process .",
    "recent studies from star @xcite were able to resolve the angular distribution within the jets and thus probe the collins function directly .",
    "their data suggests that the collins effect s contribution to the asymmetry is small or consistent with zero , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - collins ] .",
    "asymmetry within final - state jets as a function of the angle @xmath21 between the outgoing pion and the jet thrust axis .",

    "proton collision is high enough , the projectile scatters off of the target s small-@xmath23 parton distribution where parton densities are high .",
    "the effective interactions in this small-@xmath23 regime are well described by the parton saturation / color glass condensate ( cgc ) formalism @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite which resums the multiple rescatterings in these dense color fields and incorporates the small-@xmath23 evolution of those fields .",
    "this saturation framework is expressed naturally in coordinate space and introduces a characteristic saturation scale @xmath4 describing the color - charge density fluctuations within the target .    with the cgc interactions that mediate @xmath22 scattering in mind ,",
    "it is natural to search for the asymmetry using the language of the small-@xmath23 interactions , light - cone perturbation theory ( lcpt ) @xcite , instead of the usual collinear factorization . using lcpt",
    ", we calculate spin - dependent processes that contribute to the projectile s light - cone wave function , then convolute this wave function ( squared ) with the known scattering amplitudes from cgc that are responsible for the interaction of partons with the target . surprisingly enough",
    "this procedure yields a non - zero stsa for quark and gluon production in @xmath22 scattering .",
    "our approach yields a different but complementary picture to the usual collinear factorization mechanisms for generating stsa and may provide new insight into the underlying physics for generating transverse spin asymmetry .    in the past the interplay of spin and small-@xmath23 evolution",
    "was investigated in @xcite using the standard feynman diagram approach . in more recent years",

    "was studied in @xcite , with the stsa being a completely non - perturbative effect on top of the perturbative cgc dynamics .",
    "other non - perturbative approaches include using qcd instantons to generate stsa as discussed in @xcite .    in this paper , we present an analysis of stsa generated by the interaction of the spin - dependent lcpt wave function of the projectile with the target gluon field in the saturation / cgc framework .",

    "[ sec - estimates ] we simplify the interaction of the light - cone wave function with the target using the glauber - mueller approximation @xcite , and we present a closed - form estimate of the asymmetry for produced quarks .",
    "we find that a @xmath1-odd exchange alone is insufficient to generate the asymmetry , and needs to be accompanied by a @xmath1-even exchange for the asymmetry to be non - zero .",
    "we also see that the generated stsa ( @xmath12 ) is a non - monotonic function of transverse momentum @xmath3 and an increasing function of @xmath2 , in qualitative agreement with the data shown in .",

    "we are interested in isolating the spin - dependent contribution of the quark  target scattering .",
    "certainly keeping only the eikonal interaction would be insufficient to reach this goal , since the eikonal scattering is independent of the quark polarization .",
    "a non - eikonal correction has to be included : in the multiple - rescattering glauber - mueller @xcite approximation , the non - eikonal rescattering corrections are suppressed by powers of energy and are very small .",
    "a much larger spin - dependent contribution comes from the non - eikonal splitting of the projectile quark into a quark and a gluon , @xmath0 , which is suppressed only by a power of the strong coupling @xmath30 . in the lcpt language",

    "one can also see that while our stsa in is mostly positive , the data for @xmath314 mesons in the left panel of gives a negative stsa .",
    "this result can be explained in the following simple model .",
    "imagine a constituent - quark model of a proton , with the spins of both up quarks aligned with the net proton spin , and the spin of the down quark pointing in the opposite direction .",
    "then in our mechanism each up - quark would give a positive stsa denoted @xmath315 , while the down - quark would give a negative stsa of the same absolute value , denoted @xmath316 .",
    "imagining that after the collision the up - quarks fragment into @xmath317 s and @xmath318 s , while the down quarks fragment into @xmath318 s and @xmath314 s , and taking into account that there are twice as many up - quarks than down - quarks in the proton , and neglecting pions resulting from the gluon fragmentation , we obtain @xmath319 , @xmath320 , and @xmath321 , thus obtaining a negative stsa for @xmath314 s .",
    "this naive model appears to be in a qualitative agreement ( and in loose quantitative agreement ) with the data in the left panel of .",
    "inclusion of gluon fragmentation may further improve the quantitative agreement with the data .",
    "finally , to test the dependence of our stsa in on the size of the target , we note that for @xmath322 one gets @xmath323 if @xmath324 .",
    "this indicates a very steep falloff of stsa with the atomic number of the nuclear target .",

    "are overly simple and is not ready to be compared to the data .",

    "hence the photon stsa is zero , @xmath334 , in the forward production region under consideration .",
    "to conclude let us summarize the main points of this work .",
    "above we have shown how stsa can be generated in the cgc formalism for quark and gluon production .",
    "the results for the corresponding cross sections are given in eqs .  , and .",
    "the same mechanism gives zero stsa for prompt photons .    in our case stsa",
    "is generated by both a splitting in the projectile wave function , and by the combination of the @xmath1-odd and @xmath1-even interactions with the target .",
    "hence our stsa - generating mechanism is distinctively different from the collins @xcite and sivers @xcite effects , and is more akin to ( though still different from ) the higher - twist mechanisms of @xcite .",
    "evaluating the quark stsa in a simplified quasi - classical model we found qualitative agreement with the data : quark stsa appears to be a non - monotonic function of @xmath3 , and is an increasing function of increasing @xmath2 ( for most of the @xmath2-range ) .",
    "it is perhaps encouraging that the obtained asymmetry can be of the order - of - magnitude of the experimental data .",
    "further phenomenological studies of our formulas and are needed to determine whether this qualitative agreement of our results with the data can become quantitative .    analyzing the general quark production formula one can see that the contribution to stsa arises from the @xmath335 anti - symmetric part of the integrand . in arriving at from we employed the lowest - order ( order-@xmath30 ) spin - dependent part of the light - cone wave function squared , which happens to be symmetric under the @xmath169 interchange : hence , in our case , to obtain a contribution to the stsa",
    "the interaction with the target had to be @xmath336 anti - symmetric . however , it is possible that higher - order corrections to the light - cone wave function squared would lead to a @xmath169 anti - symmetric contribution .",
    "( by the wave function corrections we understand all the initial and final state corrections with rapidities between the projectile and the particle we tag on . ) in such case , the interaction with the target need not be @xmath169 anti - symmetric , and can be mediated by the standard @xmath1-even exchange . to test whether such scenario is feasible within the cgc / saturation perturbative framework one has to calculate the higher order corrections to the polarization - dependent light - cone wave function squared .",
    "the corrections would need a generate a relative complex phase between the corrected and uncorrected wave functions , in agreement with the initial proposal of @xcite .",
    "this can be accomplished in lcpt if the corrections lead to an intermediate state , for which the imaginary part of the energy denominator leads to a non - vanishing polarization - dependent contribution to the scattering amplitude .",
    "an example of such corrections in our case could be a modification of the amplitude in resulting from a gluon exchange between the outgoing quark and gluon formed in the projectile splitting .",
    "calculation of such diagrams appears to be rather complicated and is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "however , it potentially may give a contribution comparable to the stsa resulting from : the latter consists of the order-@xmath30 light - cone wave function squared , convoluted with the target interaction resumming powers of @xmath337 and @xmath338 , with one extra power of @xmath30 due to the odderon exchange .",
    "our contribution is , therefore , order-@xmath339 , if one assumes that @xmath340 and @xmath341 , which is parametrically comparable to the @xmath1-odd order-@xmath339 light - cone wave function squared , interacting with the target through a @xmath1-even order - one exchange . an explicit calculation is needed to explore this possibility and is left for future work .",
    "the authors are much indebted to mike lisa for strongly encouraging them to think about spin physics at rhic .",

    "( the overall factor in front of the averaged odderon amplitude should indeed depend on the details of the averaging ; however , we believe the coordinate - space dependence would remain the same for other models of the nuclear wave function . )",
    "the target averaging then consists of averaging over the positions of the quark in the nucleon and over the positions of nucleons in the nucleus , along with summation over all nucleons .",

    "the dipole has to hit the nucleon directly in order to be able to interact with the quarks inside of it .",
    "since the dipole @xmath344 is perturbatively small , we enforce this condition by demanding that only the center of the dipole is inside the nucleon s transverse extent .",
    "to integrate over @xmath216 in we notice that @xmath345 if the integration carries over the whole transverse plane . using this result",

    "we expand @xmath354 with @xmath355 the transverse gradient operator .",
    "such expansion is potentially dangerous near the edge of the nucleus profile , where the derivatives may get large .",
    "for instance , for a solid - sphere model of the nucleus the nuclear profile function is @xmath356 with @xmath286 the nucleon density and @xmath285 the nuclear radius ; the derivatives of such @xmath353 near @xmath357 are divergent . using the realistic woods - saxon profile would make the derivatives finite , but they would still be large .",
    "thus we will proceed by using the expansion as a way to simplify the expression , keeping in mind that in the cases where this expansion breaks down one has to return back to .    substituting into and integrating over @xmath358 yields ( for the first non - trivial term after integration ) @xmath359 \\ ( \\bm x - \\bm y ) \\cdot { \\bm \\nabla }   t \\ ! \\left(\\frac{\\bm x + \\bm y}{2 } \\right).\\ ] ] this is our final expression for the target - averaged odderon amplitude .",
    "note an interesting feature of : the non - zero contribution to the odderon amplitude in the transverse coordinate space arises from the gradient of the nuclear profile function .",
    "the odderon interaction with the target is thus only possible if the target has a non - uniform profile in the transverse space .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the @xmath1-even exchanges , which are non - zero even for the bjorken model of a nucleus of infinite transverse extent with constant density in the transverse plane .",

    "<S> we propose a new mechanism for generating a single transverse spin asymmetry ( stsa ) in polarized proton  proton and proton  nucleus collisions in the high - energy scattering approximation . in this framework </S>",
    "<S> the stsa originates from the @xmath0 splitting in the projectile ( proton ) light - cone wave function followed by a perturbative ( @xmath1-odd ) odderon interaction , together with a @xmath1-even interaction , between the projectile and the target . </S>",
    "<S> we show that some aspects of the obtained expression for the stsa of the produced quarks are in qualitative agreement with experiment : stsa decreases with decreasing projectile @xmath2 and is a non - monotonic function of the transverse momentum @xmath3 . in our framework the stsa peaks at @xmath3 near the saturation scale @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our mechanism predicts that the quark stsa in proton  nucleus collisions should be much smaller than in proton  proton collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that in our formalism the stsa for prompt photons is zero . </S>"
