    "for @xmath0 , a self - gravitating system is expected to achieve a statistical equilibrium state described by the boltzmann distribution .",
    "this statistical approach is the correct description of globular clusters , which are small groups of stars ( @xmath3 ) whose age is of the same order as the relaxation time .",
    "their observed thermal distribution ( michie - king models ) is the natural outcome of a `` collisional '' relaxation due to the development of stellar encounters .",
    "this collisional relaxation is usually described by the gravitational kinetic landau equation which satisfies a h - theorem for the boltzmann entropy .",
    "fundamentally , the boltzmann entropy is equal to the logarithm of disorder where the disorder measures the number of microstates ( complexions ) associated with a given macrostate .",
    "the maximization of the boltzmann entropy at fixed mass and energy has a clear statistical and thermodynamical meaning : it determines the most probable distribution of stars at equilibrium , assuming that the microstates are equiprobable .",
    "however , unlike ordinary systems , the statistical mechanics of self - gravitating systems encounters some difficulties due to the long - range unshielded nature of gravity and the divergence of the potential at short distances @xcite .",
    "in particular , there is no statistical equilibrium state in a strict sense : the boltzmann entropy has no global maximum and isothermal distributions have infinite mass @xcite .",
    "the increase of entropy as the system spreads reflects the natural tendency of stellar clusters to evaporate ( this is already the case for a classical gas , without gravity , if it is not confined by the walls of a container ) .",
    "a statistical equilibrium state can be defined only in a weaker sense if the system is tidally truncated or confined by the pressure exerted by an external medium .",
    "theorists overcome the infinite mass problem by confining the system within a box .",
    "physically , the box delimits the region of space where the system can be assumed isolated and described by thermodynamical arguments .",
    "typically , the box radius plays the same role as the tidal radius .",
    "however , even for box - confined systems , statistical equilibrium does not exist if the energy is too low . below the antonov threshold @xcite ,",
    "the system undergoes gravitational collapse called gravothermal catastrophe @xcite .",
    "this core collapse ultimately leads to the formation of binaries @xcite .",
    "statistical equilibrium states exist at sufficiently high energies .",
    "they are metastable ( local entropy maxima ) but their lifetime is considerable as it increases exponentially rapidly with the number of particles @xcite .",
    "therefore , small clusters of stars such as globular clusters correspond to long - lived metastable states .",
    "furthermore , for self - gravitating systems , statistical ensembles are non - equivalent @xcite and , for isolated systems , only the microcanonical ensemble makes sense . to our opinion , the evaporation of stellar clusters , the gravothermal catastrophe , the formation of binaries and the long - lived metastability of globular clusters are the correct answers to the absence of strict statistical equilibrium for self - gravitating systems .",
    "they correspond to important physical processes that have been clearly identified in astrophysics . _ with these limitations in mind , self - gravitating systems can be described by conventional statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "_    however , for systems with long - range interactions , the collisional relaxation time is extremely long because it increases algebraically with the number @xmath1 of particles .",
    "for example , for stellar systems , the chandrasekhar relaxation time scales as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the dynamical time .",
    "therefore , for a very long period , encounters between stars are negligible and the galactic dynamics is described by the vlasov , or collisionless boltzmann , equation coupled to gravity via the poisson equation @xcite .",
    "the vlasov - poisson system is the correct description of large groups of stars such as elliptical galaxies ( @xmath6 ) that are still , at the present time , in the collisionless regime ( contrary to globular clusters ) .",
    "now , the vlasov equation admits an infinite class of stationary solutions . along its collisionless evolution",
    ", a stellar system can be trapped in one of these stationary solutions and remain frozen in that state for a very long time , until collisional effects come into play .",
    "physically , the convergence to a steady state is due to phase mixing and incomplete violent relaxation @xcite .",
    "these steady states , referred to as quasi - stationary states or metaequilibrium states , are described by non - standard ( non - boltzmannian ) distributions @xmath7 .",
    "this is not really surprising since the system is collisionless so that there is no relation with thermodynamics in the usual sense .",
    "tsallis distributions @xmath8 @xcite form a particular class of stationary solutions of the vlasov equation .",
    "in fact , these distributions are known for a long time in astrophysics .",
    "they are called _ stellar polytropes _ and were introduced by plummer @xcite in 1911 and eddington @xcite in 1916 . although these distributions have interesting mathematical properties and have been used to construct simple theoretical models of galaxies @xcite , it is important to note that they do not provide a good fit of observed galaxies . once again",
    ", this is not really surprising : there is no fundamental reason why polytropic distributions ( or tsallis distributions ) should be selected among other stationary solutions of the vlasov equation @xcite .",
    "any distribution function @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the stellar energy , is a stationary solution of the vlasov equation .",
    "it extremizes a functional of the form @xmath11=-\\int c(f)d^{3}{\\bf r}d^{3}{\\bf v}$ ] , where @xmath12 is convex , at fixed mass @xmath13 and energy @xmath14 .",
    "such functionals have been called h - functions by tremaine , hnon & lynden - bell @xcite .",

    ", the maximization of a h - function at fixed mass and energy provides a criterion of nonlinear dynamical stability for the vlasov equation @xcite .",
    "this `` dynamical interpretation '' defended by @xcite and @xcite who view metaequilibrium states as stationary solutions of the vlasov equation and interpret the maximization of a @xmath16-function as a condition of nonlinear dynamical stability is different from the `` generalized thermodynamical interpretation '' defended by @xcite who view tsallis functional @xmath15 $ ] as a generalized entropy , interpret quasi - stationary states as generalized maximum entropy states and consider the maximization of @xmath15 $ ] as a condition of generalized thermodynamical stability.=-{1\\over q-1}\\int ( f^{q}-f)d{\\bf r}d{\\bf v}$ ] defined in terms of the distribution function @xmath17 and tsallis entropy @xmath18=-{1\\over q-1}\\int ( \\rho^{q}-\\rho)d\\eta d{\\bf r}d{\\bf v}$ ] defined in terms of the probability density @xmath19 of phase levels . ignoring the specificities of the collisionless evolution ( casimir constraints ) , the authors of @xcite interprete @xmath15 $ ] as a generalized entropy while the correct form of tsallis entropy in the context of violent relaxation is @xmath18 $ ] ( it returns the lynden - bell entropy for @xmath20 which is the appropriate form of boltzmann entropy in that context ) . by contrast , @xcite interprete the tsallis functional @xmath15 $ ] as a @xmath16-function . in this paper",
    ", we only consider the functional @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the important distinction between the functionals @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath18 $ ] is further discussed in @xcite . ]",
    "there are two points that we would like to emphasize in this paper .",
    "the first point is that tsallis ( and boltzmann ) distributions do not have a fundamental importance in regard with the collisionless dynamics of stellar systems ( when the @xmath21 limit is taken before the @xmath0 limit ) .",
    "these are just _ particular _ stationary solutions of the vlasov equation @xcite .",
    "this is different from the boltzmann distribution in regard with the collisional dynamics of stellar systems ( when the @xmath0 limit is taken before the @xmath22 limit ) .",
    "the boltzmann distribution is of fundamental importance as it describes the statistical equilibrium state of the system ( up to all the limitations mentioned in the first paragraph ) .",
    "furthermore , it is the _",
    "unique _ stationary solution of the kinetic landau equation which describes the collisional relaxation of stellar systems to order @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "thus , the first order correction to the vlasov limit selects the boltzmann distribution .",
    "the second point that we want to emphasize is that , formally , the criterion of nonlinear dynamical stability for collisionless stellar systems described by the vlasov - poisson system _ resembles _ a criterion of generalized thermodynamical stability in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "therefore , we can develop an _ effective thermodynamical formalism _ ( e.t.f ) to investigate the nonlinear dynamical stability of collisionless stellar systems @xcite . in this _ thermodynamical analogy _ , the notions of entropy , free energy and temperature are effective .",
    "we stress that our e.t.f .",
    "has a meaning different from the one given by @xcite . in our point of view , tsallis functional @xmath15 $ ] is related to dynamics , not thermodynamics , in the case of collisionless stellar systems .",
    "what we do essentially is to use the language of thermodynamics to study nonlinear dynamical stability problems .",
    "we stress that the `` thermodynamical analogy '' that we develop is only valid for distribution functions of the form @xmath24 with @xmath25 that describe a sub - class of _ spherical _ stellar systems @xcite .",
    "we have also found that , formally , the criterion of nonlinear dynamical stability for barotropic stars described by the euler - poisson system resembles a criterion of thermodynamical stability in the canonical ensemble @xcite . since `` canonical stability implies microcanonical stability in thermodynamics '' ,",
    "we deduce , using our thermodynamical analogy , that `` the stability of a barotropic star implies the stability of the corresponding stellar system ( but not the converse ) '' .",
    "this provides an original interpretation of the nonlinear antonov first law in terms of ensemble inequivalence @xcite .",
    "tsallis distributions can also arise in other domains of physics and astrophysics for different reasons .",
    "for example , polytropic distributions correspond to the unique stationary state of a certain class of generalized kinetic equations or generalized fokker - planck equations satisfying a h - theorem for the tsallis entropy ( or free energy ) @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear at the present time to which physical systems these generalized kinetic equations apply .",
    "we have argued that they may be `` effective equations '' trying to take into account `` hidden constraints '' in complex systems @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that it is possible to formally generalize kinetic and fokker - planck equations , so that they increase an arbitrary entropy @xcite , not necessarily the boltzmann or the tsallis one . in a different context ,",
    "taruya & sakagami @xcite have shown that the collisional evolution of stellar systems , between the phase of violent relaxation and the phase of gravothermal catastrophe , can be described by a sequence of polytropic distributions with a time varying index , interpreted as _ quasi - equilibrium states_. in conclusion , tsallis distributions ( and other non - standard distributions ) arise in different domains of physics ( biology , economy , ... ) for reasons that are not necessarily related to thermodynamics .",
    "the important point is to explain , in each specific situation , what is the _ physical meaning _ of such distributions .",
    "we shall give here various examples in astrophysics but the concepts that we discuss can apply to other systems with long - range interactions .",
    "we consider a self - gravitating gaseous medium described by the euler - poisson system @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 we assume that the gas is barotropic with an equation of state @xmath29 .",
    "this provides the simplest model of stars @xcite .",

    "it is straightforward to verify that the energy functional ( [ ep4 ] ) is conserved by the euler - poisson system ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "therefore , a minimum of @xmath33 at fixed mass determines a stationary solution of the euler - poisson system which is nonlinearly dynamically stable @xcite .",
    "physically , this means that a small perturbation remains close ( in some norm ) to the minimum .",
    "we are led therefore to consider the minimization problem @xmath34\\quad |\\ m[\\rho]=m\\rbrace . \\label{ej4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this minimization problem is consistent with the phenomenology of star formation .",

    "( [ ep4 ] ) , we obtain @xmath35 and the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath36 between pressure and gravity .",

    "it is shown that the point in the series of equilibria where the system ceases to be a minimum of @xmath33 and becomes a saddle point coincides with the point of neutral linear stability .",

    "therefore , the results of taruya & sakagami @xcite tend to disfavor tsallis thermodynamics instead of establishing it : indeed , @xmath264-polytropes can emerge from a kinetic equation based on standard thermodynamics ( boltzmann h - theorem ) .",
    "in addition , it seems unlikely that @xmath264-polytropes are _ exact _ solutions of the orbit - averaged - fokker - planck equation , so that they represent more a convenient fit for the solutions of a complicated nonlinear time dependent partial differential equation than a fundamental outcome of a `` generalized thermodynamics '' .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear whether they attract all the solutions of the orbit - averaged - fokker - planck equation or if their `` basin of attraction '' is limited to some particular initial conditions . finally , it is not clear whether the interpretation of polytropic distributions functions given by taruya & sakagami @xcite as quasi - equilibrium states of a collisional dynamics extends to other systems with long - range interactions such as the hmf model for example .",
    "these are important questions to consider . in any case",
    ", the numerical experiments of taruya & sakagami @xcite fill the gap between the description of the `` violent relaxation '' ( first stage ) and the description of the `` gravothermal catastrophe '' ( ultimate stage ) of stellar systems .",
    "we have discussed three distinct interpretations of tsallis functional @xmath15 $ ] in astrophysics .",
    "most discussion has been devoted to vlasov - poisson systems .",
    "systems with long - range interactions spontaneously form `` coherent structures '' that are not described in general by the boltzmann distribution .",
    "this is the case for galaxies in astrophysics , vortices in 2d turbulence and quasi - stationary states in the hmf model .",
    "two types of interpretation have been given to describe these structures . in the `` generalized thermodynamical interpretation '' @xcite ,",
    "the metaequilibrium states are viewed as generalized statistical equilibrium states .",
    "the maximization of the tsallis entropy @xmath15 $ ] at fixed mass and energy provides a condition of generalized thermodynamical stability . in the `` dynamical interpretation '' given here and in @xcite , the metaequilibrium states are particular stationary solutions of the vlasov equation .",
    "any df @xmath24 with @xmath25 extremizes a certain functional @xmath11=-\\int c(f)d{\\bf r}d{\\bf v}$ ] , called a h - function , at fixed mass and energy .",
    "the condition of maximum is a criterion of nonlinear dynamical stability via the vlasov equation .",
    "these two interpretations are physically different .",
    "however , formally , the criterion of nonlinear dynamical stability for collisionless stellar systems described by the vlasov equation resembles a criterion of thermodynamical stability in the microcanonical ensemble and the criterion of nonlinear dynamical stability for barotropic stars described by the euler equation resembles a criterion of thermodynamical stability in the canonical ensemble .",
    "we have used this `` thermodynamical analogy '' to provide an original interpretation of the antonov first law in terms of ensemble inequivalence .",
    "however , the resemblance with a thermodynamical formalism is effective .    in this paper , we have not discussed _ how _ a collisionless stellar system described by the vlasov - poisson system can reach a quasi - stationary distribution ( meta - equilibrium ) and what determines this metaequilibrium state .",
    "this is discussed in @xcite based on the concept of phase mixing and violent relaxation introduced by lynden - bell @xcite in 1967 . as a result of a mixing process",
    ", the coarse - grained distribution function @xmath265 achieves a stationary state on a very short timescale ( of the order of a few dynamical times ) while the fine - grained distribution function @xmath266 develops intermingled filaments at smaller and smaller scales .",
    "lynden - bell tried to predict the optimal metaequilibrium state by using statistical mechanics arguments .",
    "this prediction is complicated because we have to deal with an infinite number of constraints ( casimirs ) .",
    "therefore , the coarse - grained distribution function arising from the statistical theory of violent relaxation is non - boltzmannian in general @xcite . it can be viewed as a sort of superstatistics @xcite . in the dilute limit of his theory ,",
    "lynden - bell @xcite predicted an isothermal distribution @xmath267 .",
    "he also understood that his prediction fails for high energies ( corresponding to extended orbits ) due to the complicated problem of _ incomplete relaxation _ : the systems tends to reach the statistical equilibrium state ( most mixed ) but can not attain it because the fluctuations of the gravitational field , which are the engine of the relaxation , rapidly die away .",
    "this is why other stationary solutions of the vlasov equation can emerge in practice corresponding to partially mixed states leading to confined structures .",
    "this kinetic confinement can be understood by developing dynamical models of violent relaxation @xcite .",
    "the metaequilibrium state reached by the system as a result of incomplete violent relaxation is very difficult to predict because it depends on the efficiency of mixing .",
    "it is different in general from tsallis distribution ( pure polytrope ) @xcite .",
    "for example , stellar polytropes do not provide good models of galaxies @xcite .",
    "a better model is a composite model @xcite with an isothermal core ( @xmath268 , @xmath20 ) justified by lynden - bell s theory of violent relaxation and a polytropic halo ( @xmath269 , @xmath270 ) resulting from incomplete relaxation . in this context , we have proposed to interpret the @xmath157 parameter , which can vary in space , as a _ measure of mixing _ @xcite .",
    "these general concepts also apply to 2d vortices in hydrodynamics @xcite and to the hmf model @xcite .",
    "we note that the maximization problem ( [ vh3 ] ) determining the nonlinear dynamical stability of collisionless stellar systems is consistent with the phenomenology of violent relaxation @xcite . indeed , the h - functions @xmath271=-\\int c(\\overline{f } ) d^{3}{\\bf r}d^{3}{\\bf v}$ ] calculated with the coarse - grained distribution function @xmath265 increase with time ( @xmath272 decreases ) , a property similar to the h - theorem of thermodynamics , while the energy and the mass remain approximately conserved .",
    "however , contrary to the boltzmann equation , the vlasov equation does not single out a unique h - function and the increase of the h - functions is not necessarily monotonic . because of this generalized _ selective decay principle _ @xcite , we may expect the system to achieve a metaequilibrium state which maximizes one of the h - functions ( non universal ) at fixed mass and energy .",
    "this is consistent with the criterion of nonlinear dynamical stability ( [ vh3 ] ) provided that we interpret the distribution function as the _ coarse - grained _ distribution function .",
    "it is remarkable that these two maximization principles are consistent although they have a very different physical content ( there is no notion of `` dissipation '' in the first while this lies at the heart of the second due to coarse - graining ) .",
    "plastino & plastino @xcite correctly made the link with h - functions but they also gave the impression that tsallis functional is special because of its thermodynamical properties .",
    "in addition , plastino & plastino @xcite did not explain why we have to _ maximize _ the tsallis functional .",
    "this is important because , as discussed above , this maximization problem is related to nonlinear dynamical stability , not thermodynamical stability . in particular , the notion of normalized @xmath157-averages ( as done in paper iii of @xcite ) is not relevant to settle the nonlinear dynamical stability of collisionless stellar systems .    in conclusion , our discussion shows that the notions of dynamics and thermodynamics are intermingled .",
    "there are lot of analogies ( formal or real ) and differences .",
    "this is a little bit similar to the wave / particle duality in quantum mechanics , each aspect having been defended by different schools .",
    "the coherent structures that form in long - range systems have both dynamical and thermodynamical ( mixing ) properties .",
    "we think , however , that the correct description of quasi - equilibrium states is , fundamentally , in terms of nonlinear dynamical stability arguments . indeed , a collisionless stellar system can be trapped in a steady state of the vlasov equation that does",
    "_ not _ satisfy the `` thermodynamic - looking '' criterion ( [ vh3 ] ) .",
    "the maximization principle ( [ vh3 ] ) leads to df of the form @xmath24 with @xmath25 depending only on energy so that it only characterizes _ spherical _ stellar systems which seldomly occur in nature .",
    "now , there exists stationary solutions of the vlasov equation , consistent with the jeans theorem @xcite , that do not depend on the energy alone .",
    "this is the case for most observed stellar systems . in that case",
    "all the analogies with thermodynamics break down .",
    "this `` problem '' does not occur for 1d systems such as the hmf model because @xmath24 is the general form of stationary solutions of the vlasov equation for these systems .",
    "the case of stellar systems is therefore interesting with respect to 1d systems to show the limitations of the `` effective '' thermodynamical formalism . in conclusion ,",
    "the dynamics and thermodynamics of systems with long - range interactions is rich and complex .",
    "we have given a lengthy discussion of these concepts in @xcite . in summary , we come to the following scenario :      \\1 . the rapid emergence of coherent structures in stellar dynamics ( galaxies ) , two - dimensional turbulence ( jets and vortices ) and in the hmf model ( quasi - stationary states ) can be explained by a theory of _ incomplete violent relaxation _ based on the vlasov or euler equation , see @xcite .",
    "formally , the vlasov equation is obtained when the @xmath21 limit is taken before the @xmath0 limit .",
    "\\3 . due to violent relaxation and phase mixing @xcite",
    ", the coarse - grained distribution function @xmath265 converges toward a steady state @xmath275 which is a stationary solution of the vlasov equation .",
    "the convergence takes a few dynamical times , independent on @xmath1 .",
    "the fine - grained distribution @xmath266 develops filaments at smaller and smaller scales and does not achieve a steady state ( presumably ) .",
    "\\4 . if mixing is complete , @xmath275 is given by lynden - bell s theory of violent relaxation @xcite .",
    "it is in general a non - standard ( non boltzmannian ) distribution depending on the initial conditions through the casimirs .",
    "it can be viewed as a form of superstatistics @xcite .",
    "if mixing is incomplete , the lynden - bell prediction fails ( by definition ! ) since @xmath275 is only partially mixed .",
    "incomplete relaxation @xcite can be explained by dynamical models of violent relaxation which involve a diffusion coefficient that vanishes in certain regions of phase - space and for large times @xcite .    \\6 . since @xmath275 results from a complicated mixing process , it is a nonlinearly dynamically stable stationary ( i.e. , robust ) solution of the vlasov equation .",
    "the general form of stationary solutions is given by the jeans theorem @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that , in theories of violent relaxation , we must view the steady distribution function as the _ coarse - grained _ df .",
    "it is in general very difficult to predict the state actually reached by the system in case of incomplete relaxation as it depends on the efficiency of mixing which itself depends on the `` route to equilibrium '' ( dynamics ) .",
    "it does not appear to be explained by the generalized thermodynamics introduced by tsallis in an attempt to describe non - ergodic behaviours @xcite .",
    "if @xmath276 with @xmath277 , which is a particular case of the jeans theorem , it extremizes a h - function at fixed mass and energy @xcite .",

    ", we can develop a _",
    "thermodynamical analogy _",
    "@xcite to investigate the nonlinear dynamical stability problem , but all the notions of thermodynamics are formal or effective .",
