    "magnetic reconnection is one of the most fundamental processes in plasma physics , in which stored magnetic energy is rapidly released and converted into kinetic and internal energies through the change of magnetic field topology .",
    "it is widely believed to play a major role in explosive phenomena such as magnetospheric substorms and stellar flares .",
    "the reconnection intrinsically contains a hierarchical structure ranging from the fully kinetic scale to the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) scale . in order to identify the essential physics necessary to model the reconnection",
    ", @xcite conducted numerical simulations with a variety of codes from kinetic codes to conventional resistive mhd codes .",
    "they showed that only the mhd simulation with uniform resistivity fails to trigger fast reconnection , indicating that resistive mhd would be insufficient to model it .",
    "the role of resistive dissipation on the reconnection has been extensively investigated in the framework of mhd .",
    "a classical sweet - parker model predicts the rate of the reconnection proportional to the square root of resistivity that is too slow to account for observed phenomena .",
    "subsequent studies have demonstrated that the sweet - parker type current sheet undergoes secondary instabilities for sufficiently small resistivity ( large lundquist number ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting reconnection rate seems to be independent of resistivity @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the impact of other dissipation processes should be discussed .",
    "we focus on viscosity and heat transfer .",
    "viscosity might support the nonlinear evolution of the reconnection @xcite whereas it suppresses the linear growth @xcite .",
    "the ratio of kinematic viscosity to resistivity is defined as the magnetic prandtl number , which relates the dissipation scale of vortex to current .",
    "resistive mhd assumes this number to be zero , meaning that the vortex scale is negligible small compared with the current scale .",
    "however , it is not necessarily true in actual plasma environments @xcite ; the number can be much larger than unity in a classical spitzer model for hot tenuous plasmas @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have demonstrated that it affects the nonlinear evolution of mhd phenomena such as small - scale turbulence and dynamo @xcite .",
    "it may also impact on the reconnection in which small - scale dissipation processes eventually result in large - scale evolution . in the kinetic reconnection composed of collisionless ions and electrons ,",
    "the reconnection region has a two - scale structure of broad ion diffusion region and narrow electron diffusion region embedded there @xcite .",
    "this structure may be measured as broad vortex and narrow current layers from the viewpoint of mhd , because the momentum and the current are predominantly sustained by ions and electrons , respectively .",
    "heat transfer is associated with the reconnection .",
    "high - energy particles are produced in the vicinity of a reconnection site and stream along a magnetic field line during the collisionless reconnection @xcite . in the solar flare ,",
    "thermal conduction is effective along a magnetic field line and may affect the evolution of the collisional reconnection @xcite . including heat transfer increases compressibility that can enhance the reconnection @xcite .",
    "the fluid prandtl number , the ratio of kinematic viscosity to temperature conductivity , is around @xmath2 in the spitzer model .",
    "therefore , actual plasmas can have the following inequality for the timescale of three diffusion processes , @xmath3 . in order to ascertain the effect of viscosity and heat transfer on the nonlinear evolution of the reconnection",

    "the current sheet gets thin down after the passage of the initial perturbation .",
    "the length @xmath36 and the thickness @xmath37 of the current sheet becomes @xmath38 and @xmath39 at @xmath40 in the resistive case .",

    "similar evolution is observed in all three cases for @xmath49 and @xmath1 .",
    "contrary to the linear theory , the peak reconnection rate increases with the viscosity , @xmath50 for @xmath51 , indicating that viscosity plays a key role in boosting the reconnection .",
    "figure [ fig : cut1d](a ) shows the one - dimensional distribution across the outflow at @xmath52 at @xmath53 in the visco - resistive case including the conduction .",
    "the outflow is predominantly accelerated by the magnetic tension force and is decelerated by the viscous dissipation force .",

    "@xmath56 the aspect ratio of the reconnection region is dominated by viscosity @xcite , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the alfvn speed in the inflow region . in the classical sweet - parker model , the outflow is decelerated by the inertia force and the aspect ratio is proportional to the inverse square root of resistivity .",
    "the inflow speed in the visco - resistive case follows @xmath59 similar to the resistive case .",

    "figure [ fig : voz_prof](a ) shows the time profile of the spatially - integrated terms in the visco - resistive case including the conduction .",
    "the lorentz terms dominate over the baroclinic and inertia terms and balance with the viscous term .",

    "the enstrophy is predominantly excited in the current sheet ( red - colored region in ( b ) ) .",
    "the second lorentz term ( c ) , which is approximated as @xmath69 around the reconnection region , is positive for the density decreasing from the upstream toward the current sheet ( for example , @xmath70 in first quadrant ) .",
    "the viscous term ( d ) is negative in the current sheet , but turns to be positive around the outer edge of the sheet due to viscous transfer . as a whole ( e )",
    ", the enstrophy emerges also outside of the current sheet .",
    "this is an indication of the positive feedback toward the upstream via viscosity .",
    "figure [ fig : thickness_profile ] compares the time profile of the thickness of the out - of - plane current and vortex layers .",
    "they are obtained by fitting the current and vortex distributions across the reconnection site with @xmath71 and @xmath72 functions .",
    "the ideal mhd condition is violated in the current sheet . in the resistive case ( a )",
    ", the vortex is restricted within the current sheet .",
    "since the magnetic field is no longer frozen into the plasma within this vortex scale , the vortex flow does not carry the magnetic flux toward the reconnection site .",
    "thermal conduction does not change this situation as is shown in ( b ) . on the other hand , the condition @xmath0 allows the transfer of the vortex outside of the current sheet as is indicated in figure [ fig : voz_prof](e ) .",
    "the vortex can be decoupled from the fluid in the upstream whereas the magnetic field is still coupled with .",
    "consequently , the vortex is broader than the current in the visco - resistive cases ( c , d ) .",
    "this is a favorable situation for the reconnection because the broad vortex flow enables the transfer of the upstream frozen - in magnetic flux toward the reconnection region .",
    "viscosity has linear and nonlinear stabilizing effects on the reconnection .",
    "the viscous dissipation leads to plasma heating via @xmath73 . without convection or diffusion , the heated plasma stagnates at the current sheet and inhibits its thinning .",
    "the thinning speed of the current sheet is slower than that of the vortex in the visco - resistive case without the conduction ( figure [ fig : thickness_profile](c ) ) .",
    "the evolution is saturated when the thickness of the current sheet exceeds the vortex at @xmath74 .",
    "the reconnection rate remains slow in this case .",
    "the simulation indicates that the visco - resistive reconnection can evolve against the inhibition in the presence of thermal conduction .",
    "thermal conduction will decrease the temperature around the reconnection region that leads to the compression of the plasma to satisfy the force balance .",
    "it can be accompanied by the upstream magnetic flux provided that the spatial scale of the fluid is broader than that of the magnetic field .",
    "figure [ fig : thickness_profile](d ) indicates that the thinning speed of the current is as much as that of the vortex and the vortex layer is always broader than the current in the nonlinear stage , persisting the efficient supply of the upstream magnetic flux to the reconnection region .",
    "both the vortex and current layers are narrower than those in the visco - resistive case without the conduction .",
    "the ratio of the thickness of vortex to current is found to scale as @xmath75 within the explored range .",
    "this would be related to the positive correlation of the reconnection rate with viscosity .",
    "the scaling deviates from a simple prediction @xmath76 in which the viscous dissipation time balances with the resistive dissipation time .",
    "it is reasonable to speculate that @xmath77 is a necessary condition to sustain the visco - resistive reconnection since thermal conduction is expected to be fast enough to take away the thermal energy increased by the viscous dissipation . in order to confirm the effect of thermal conduction , figure [ fig : temp_profile](a ) shows the temperature at the reconnection site as a function of the amount of the reconnected flux .",
    "the peak temperature is roughly proportional to the viscosity . when @xmath78 ( green and magenda ) , thermal conduction is not effective for the cases @xmath44 whereas it successfully decreases the temperature and boosts the reconnection for @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath79 ( red ) , on the other hand , thermal conduction succeeds in decreasing the temperature even with @xmath80 the peak temperature values are 200 for @xmath81 , 40 for @xmath82 , and 20 for @xmath83 .",
    "figure [ fig : temp_profile](b)-(d ) shows the temperature distribution at which the reconnected flux is about the same for these three cases .",
    "high temperature plasma is observed in a quite narrow layer in the case ( b ) , indicating a lack of a way to redistribute the thermal energy .",
    "the temperature distribution in the case ( c ) is somewhat diffusive .",
    "however , narrow high temperature layer and a large plasmoid remains around @xmath84 and @xmath41 , and the subsequent evolution is similar to the case ( b ) .",
    "thus , thermal conduction with @xmath82 is not fast enough to sustain the visco - resistive reconnection compared with the case ( d ) , in which high temperature region becomes broader toward the downstream .",
    "based on the visco - resistive mhd simulation coupled with anisotropic thermal conduction , we propose the viscosity - dominated reconnection model in figure [ fig : schematic_rep ] .",
    "viscosity and thermal conduction can be a key to boost the reconnection in the mhd regime .",
    "the reconnection rate is found to increase with viscosity within the explored range provided that thermal conduction is fast enough . however , the reconnection rate in the present model is still slower than that in kinetic models @xcite .",
    "the hall - mhd model is thought to be a minimal model for fast reconnection @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out a linear analysis of the resistive tearing instability including the hall effect , and argued that the thickness of the vortex is broader than the current and the broad vortex flow is expected to enhance the reconnection .",
    "one of differences between the two models is the presence or absence of dissipation .",
    "the hall effect is purely dispersive mode without dissipation .",
    "it should more efficiently convert magnetic energy ( current ) into kinetic energy ( vortex ) than the viscosity - dominated reconnection .",
    "the inflow speed is characterized by the whistler rather than the alfvn speed in the kinetic regime , @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the ion inertia length @xcite .",
    "if we assume @xmath63 and relate the ratio @xmath87 to the aspect ratio of the reconnection region , the viscosity - dominated model ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) ) gives the effective viscosity for the kinetic reconnection as @xmath88 .",
    "it also gives the effective resistivity as @xmath89 .",
    "the effective magnetic prandtl number @xmath90 may be larger than unity in the kinetic reconnection in which the thickness of the current sheet gets thinner than the ion inertia length ( down to the electron inertia length ) .",
    "transition from the slow resistive mhd to the fast hall - mhd reconnection can be observed when the current sheet thickness falls below the ion inertia length@xcite .",
    "the decreasing density distribution from the upstream toward the current sheet is not a situation observed only in the viscosity - dominated reconnection .",
    "it has been extensively studied that ad hoc localized resistivity triggers fast reconnection in the mhd regime , the so - called petscheck - type reconnection .",
    "the decreasing density distribution is observed in the petscheck - type reconnection due to fast magnetosonic rarefaction waves emanated from the reconnection site@xcite .",
    "the rarefaction wave drives the upstream plasma toward the reconnection site since @xmath91 .",
    "the dilatation in the upstream is also seen in the viscosity - dominated reconnection .",
    "furthermore , thermal conduction facilitates the petscheck - type reconnection@xcite .",
    "observation of the solar flare supports these theoretical models @xcite .",
    "currently , it remains unclear whether the viscosity - dominated reconnection is controlled by diffusion coefficients @xmath92 or their ratio @xmath93 ( or both ) , because we have fixed the resistivity value .",
    "subsequent works will investigate the dependence on resistivity ( lundquist number ) , which is a key parameter to classify the reconnection dynamics @xcite .",
    "we may anticipate that the prandtl numbers control the dynamics to some extent because @xmath0 leads to the two - scale structure of the reconnection region and @xmath1 is required to sustain the boost .",
    "this implies that one can not ignore viscosity and thermal conduction whenever they exceed resistivity , even if their absolute values are small .",
    "the condition @xmath94 and @xmath95 can be expected in actual plasma environments such as the solar atmosphere and the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "the result indicates the importance of viscosity and heat transfer for the reconnection against the conventional resistive mhd model in which the prandtl numbers are not explicitly defined .",

    "<S> nonlinear evolution of magnetic reconnection is investigated by means of magnetohydrodynamic simulations including uniform resistivity , uniform viscosity , and anisotropic thermal conduction . when viscosity exceeds resistivity ( the magnetic prandtl number @xmath0 ) , the viscous dissipation dominates outflow dynamics and leads to the decrease in the plasma density inside a current sheet . </S>",
    "<S> the low - density current sheet supports the excitation of the vortex . </S>",
    "<S> the thickness of the vortex is broader than that of the current for @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the broader vortex flow more efficiently carries the upstream magnetic flux toward the reconnection region , and consequently boosts the reconnection . </S>",
    "<S> the reconnection rate increases with viscosity provided that thermal conduction is fast enough to take away the thermal energy increased by the viscous dissipation ( the fluid prandtl number @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the result suggests the need to control the prandtl numbers for the reconnection against the conventional resistive model . </S>"
