    "experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite suggest that a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is created in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhics ) which is strongly coupled and behaves like a near - perfect liquid  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the use of ideal relativistic hydrodynamics enabled a good description of several bulk hadron - observables encompassing more than 90% of the produced particles  @xcite .",
    "a rapid thermalization of the medium , leading to collective phenomena including elliptic flow , could be established and are key to our understanding of the macroscopic properties of the fireball .",
    "the success of ideal hydrodynamics and the conclusion that dissipative effects appear to be small has more recently led to efforts to quantify these by employing second - order viscous hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "this goal clearly requires a good control over any remaining uncertainties within the hydrodynamic framework , e.g. , the equation of state ( eos ) , initial conditions and implementations of the freezeout scenario and/or final - state transport .",
    "some of these aspects and their interplay , common to both ideal and viscous hydrodynamics , are not well understood to date .",
    "for example , the elliptic flow , @xmath8 , calculated in ideal hydrodynamics seemed to favor an eos with a strong first order phase transition  @xcite , contradicting the finite-@xmath9 cross - over transition now firmly established in lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite . on the other hand , the recent progress in solving the so - called hanbury brown - twiss ( hbt ) puzzle required several effects to increase the transverse expansion , including viscosities , initial flow and a hard eos without phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the development of initial flow , prior to the thermalization time assumed in hydrodynamics , can be expected on rather general grounds  @xcite , but has only been studied in few works to date  @xcite .",
    "the initial density profile and initial fluctuations are not yet well constrained from first principles , with both glauber- and color - glass condensate ( cgc)-based approaches currently being investigated  @xcite .",
    "if dissipative effects become large , a transition to a transport treatment of the bulk is in order , which has been studied by coupling hadronic cascades to hydrodynamic evolutions of the qgp  @xcite .",
    "however , it is quite possible that the viscosity in the hadronic phase remains small for a significant range of temperatures below @xmath10 , especially if partial chemical equilibrium is implemented .",
    "the latter becomes problematic in cascade models if the inverse of reactions with multi - particle final states need to be accounted for , as , e.g. , for baryon - antibaryon annihilation into mesons  @xcite . to date",
    ", sequential chemical and thermal freezeouts in urhics are experimentally well established , signified by statistical - model fits to hadron abundances  @xcite on the one hand ( yielding @xmath11 ) , and empirical blast - wave fits to transverse - momentum ( @xmath12 ) spectra of bulk hadrons ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 )  @xcite on the other hand ( yielding @xmath13 ) . in the hadronic eos figuring into hydrodynamics the number conservation of stable hadrons ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , etc . ) between @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be enforced by introducing pertinent chemical potentials  @xcite .",

    "we discuss in more detail our modifications to two of the above ingredients , namely the equation of state ( sec .",
    "[ ssec_eos ] ) and the initial conditions ( sec .  [ ssec_ini ] ) .",
    "the default azhydro code ( version v0.2 )  @xcite employs an equation of state ( labeled  eos-99 \" ) consisting of an ideal massless quark - gluon gas at high temperatures and a hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) in partial chemical equilibrium at low temperatures .",
    "the two parts are matched via a maxwell construction at a critical temperature @xmath28 in a first - order phase transition with a mixed phase , see dashed line in the upper panel of fig .",
    "the sound velocity @xmath29 vanishes in the mixed phase ( see the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ eos ] ) , resulting in a vanishing acceleration over a relatively long duration .",
    "consequently , the radial flow of the system largely stalls until the end of the mixed phase . in practice",
    ", this implies , e.g. , that multistrange particles like the @xmath20 baryon have to be decoupled close to the kinetic freezeout of the bulk particles , at @xmath30  mev , to reproduce the pertinent experimental spectra at rhic  @xcite .",
    "recent lattice - qcd ( lqcd ) calculations have now established that , at vanishing baryon chemical potential ( @xmath31 ) , the transition between the qgp and hadronic matter is a smooth crossover  @xcite . the pseudo - critical deconfinement transition temperature obtained by the two leading lqcd groups",
    "@xcite has now converged to a common value of around @xmath32  @xcite .",

    "the conservation of antibaryon number is of particular importance since , in turn , it triggers the build - up of pion chemical potentials  @xcite .",
    "we have verified that the pertinent chemical - equilibrium eos is consistent with the lqcd results . in the construction of our urhic eos",

    "such a profile is furthermore an essential ingredient to a realistic description of hbt radii  @xcite . as a limiting case",

    "@xcite ; only the results for @xmath76mev are shown.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we finally turn to the elliptic flow , which in our calculation is controlled , to a limited extent , by the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath56 characterizing the anisotropy of initial flow , and , to a lesser extent , by the interplay with the initial radial flow ( the initial spatial anisotropy is fixed by our assumption of the @xmath122 profile of the entropy density ) .",
    "as is well known  @xcite , the @xmath8 of massive particles is reduced at low @xmath12 by a large radial flow .",
    "this , in particular , also occurs when initial flow fields are introduced  @xcite , thus mitigating the problem of a growing pion @xmath8 in the hadronic phase when a pce eos is employed  @xcite .",
    "our results for the anisotropy coefficient of multistrange and bulk particles in semicentral au - au collisions are compared to star data in the upper and lower panel of fig .",
    "[ v2 ] , respectively .",
    "our fit yields fairly good agreement for both hadron classes .",
    "clearly , the aforementioned problem of previous pce implementations is largely resolved due to our more explosive expansion , in connection with initial flow fields , which suppress a significant increase of @xmath8 in the late stage of the hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "this was already indicated by the saturation of the anisotropy of the energy - momentum tensor anisotropy in fig .",
    "[ bulk_evolution ] .    to illustrate the significance of sequential freezeout , we display again the @xmath8 of @xmath4 and @xmath5 at @xmath76mev by thin lines in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ v2 ] . compared to the @xmath12 spectra ( the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ multisrage_spectra ] ) , the current @xmath8 data are less discriminatory for the freezeout temperature of multistrange hadrons . in accordance with the remarks at the end of sec .",
    "[ ssec_pt ] , the @xmath8 of @xmath5 may also favor a kinetic - freezeout temperature slightly below @xmath46 .",
    "in the present study we have explored the capability of ideal hydrodynamics to simultaneously and quantitatively describe bulk- and multistrange - hadron spectra and @xmath8 in au - au collisions at rhic .",
    "specifically , we have augmented an existing 2 + 1d ideal hydro code by ( i ) an equation of state compatible with recent lattice qcd data matched to a hadron resonance gas in partial chemical equilibrium , ( ii ) a sequential kinetic freezeout of multistrange and bulk particles , and ( iii ) a compact initial density profile with non - zero radial and elliptic flow .",
    "we deem these amendments  reasonable \" in the sense of being either suggested by theory ( lattice eos ) , experiment ( chemical freezeout ) and empirical fits ( early kinetic freezeout of multistrange hadrons ) , or at least plausible ( initial flow and compact profiles ) .",
    "the above items also encompass three of the four components identified for solving the pion hbt problem .",
    "the main practical consequences of the modifications are a more rapid build - up of the radial and elliptic flow , where the latter essentially levels off after hadronization .",
    "phenomenologically , the underlying parameters ( basically the three in the initial - flow field parametrization ) can be adjusted as to render multistrange hadrons kinetic freezeout at @xmath46 compatible with data , and to subsequently avoid an overshooting of the bulk - particle @xmath8 at @xmath17 .",
    "we consider this a significant improvement over existing ideal - hydro calculations , thereby corroborating the empirical picture of early freezeout of multistrange hadrons .",
    "we did not include the effects of viscosities nor of initial - state fluctuations , which are both clearly needed for realistic hydrodynamic simulations of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "however , we believe that our study can still serve as a useful baseline for the effects we have included .",
    "in addition , we anticipate that our amended azhydro can be a valuable tool as a realistic fireball background for evaluating heavy - quark(onium ) and electromagnetic probes .",
