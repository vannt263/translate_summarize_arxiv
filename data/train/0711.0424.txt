    "accretion disks are now widely believed to be energy sources in various active phenomena in the universe : in protoplanetary nebulae around young stellar objects ( ysos ) , in cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and supersoft x - ray sources ( ssxss ) , in galactic x - ray binaries and microquasars ( @xmath3qsos ) , and in active galaxies ( angs ) and quasars ( qsos ) .",
    "accretion - disk models have been extensively studies during these three decades ( see kato et al .",
    "1998 for a review ) . besides the traditional standard disk by shakura and sunayev ( 1973 ) , new type disks , such as advection - dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) or radiatively - inefficient accretion flows ( riaf ) for the very small mass - accretion rate ( e.g. , narayan , yi 1994 ) , and supercritical accretion disks or so - called slim disks for the very large mass - accretion rate ( e.g. , abramowicz et al . 1988 ) .",
    "accretion disk winds have been also extensively examined in relation to astrophysical jets and outflows : in bipolar outflows from ysos , in mass outflows from cvs and ssxss , in relativistic jets from @xmath3qsos , agns , qsos , and in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . in particular , intense radiation fields of luminous supercritical accretion disks",
    "may be responsible for relativistic jets from super - eddington sources , such as luminous @xmath3qsos , grs  1915@xmath4105 and ss  433 , luminous qsos , 3c  273 , and energetic grbs ( see , e.g. , fukue 2004 for references ) .    in such circumstances ,",
    "radiative transfer in accretion disk winds as well as accretion disks becomes more and more important .",
    "radiative transfer in the standard disk has been investigated in relation to the structure of a static disk atmosphere and the spectral energy distribution from the disk surface ( e.g. , meyer , meyer - hofmeister 1982 ; cannizzo , wheeler 1984 ) .",
    "furthermore , gray and non - gray models of accretion disks were constructed under numerical treatments ( ki and hubeny 1986 ; shaviv and wehrse 1986 ; adam et al .",
    "1988 ; mineshige , wood 1990 ; ross et al . 1992 ; shimura and takahara 1993 ; hubeny , hubeny 1997 , 1998 ; hubeny et al .",

    "; fukue , akizuki 2006a ) .",
    "radiative transfer in the accretion disk wind , on the other hand , has not been well considered both in the non - relativistic and relativistic regimes .",
    "recently , radiative transfer in a moving disk atmosphere was firstly investigated in the subrelativistic regime ( fukue 2005a , 2006a ) , and in the relativistic regime ( fukue 2005b , 2006b ; fukue , akizuki 2006b ) .",
    "in contrast to the static atmosphere , in the moving atmosphere the boundary condition at the surface of zero optical depth should be modified ( fukue 2005a , b ) . moreover",
    ", the usual eddington approximation violates in the highly relativistic flow ( fukue 2005b ; see also turolla , nobili 1988 ; nobili et al .",
    "1991 ; turolla et al . 1995 ; dullemond 1999 ) , and the velocity - dependent variable eddington factor was proposed ( fukue 2006b for a plane - parallel case ; akizuki , fukue 2007 for a spherical case )",
    ".    radiation hydrodynamical ( rhd ) simulations were also performed for radiation - dominated supercritical disks with winds by several researchers ( eggum et al .",
    "1985 , 1988 ; okuda et al . 1997 , 2005 ; okuda , fujita 2000 ; okuda 2002 ; ohsuga et al . 2005",
    "; ohsuga 2006 ) . in these current studies of rhd simulations for disks and winds ,",
    "they were done in the subrelativistic regime up to the order of @xmath0 , using the moment formalism and the flux - limited diffusion ( fld ) approximation ( levermore , pomraning 1981 ) .",
    "the flux - limited diffusion method provides good approximations to the exact solutions but only if they are derived from transfer equations in which terms of the order of @xmath5 or higher have been retained ( yin , miller 1995 ) .",
    "radiative transfer problems on accretion disks and winds are not well understood yet , in particular for the relativistic cases .",
    "hence , in order clarify the physics , in addition to rhd simulations , we must treat the simplified problem in the analytical way .    in this paper",
    ", we thus examine radiative transfer in the accretion disk wind , which is assumed to blow off from the luminous disk in the vertical direction ( plane - parallel approximation ) , and analytically and numerically obtain the flow solutions for the case without internal heating . in the previous studies ,",
    "radiative flows in the vertically moving atmosphere were solved in the subrelativistic regime ( fukue 2005a , 2006a ) , and in the relativistic regime ( fukue 2005b , 2006b ; fukue , akizuki 2006b ) , where only radiative moments were obtained . in the present paper , we further obtain the radiation intensity as well as radiative moments .    in the next section",
    "we describe the basic equations . in section 3 , we show analytical solutions , while we present numerical solutions in section 4 .",
    "the final section is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "let us suppose a luminous flat disk , deep inside which gravitational or nuclear energy is released via viscous heating or other processes .",
    "the radiation energy is transported in the vertical direction , and the disk gas , itself , also moves in the vertical direction as a _ disk wind _ due to the action of radiation pressure ( i.e. , plane - parallel approximation ) . for simplicity , in the present paper , the radiation field",
    "is considered to be sufficiently intense that both the gravitational field of , e.g. , the central object and the gas pressure can be ignored .",
    "we also assume the gray approximation , where the opacities do not depend on the frequency . as for the order of the flow velocity @xmath1",
    ", we consider the subrelativistic regime , where the terms of the first order of @xmath6 are retained , in order to take account of radiation drag .",

    "as already pointed out in fukue ( 2005b ) , the usual boundary conditions for the static atmosphere can not be used for the present radiative wind , which moves with velocity at the order of the speed of light .",
    "namely , the radiation field just above the wind top changes when the gas itself does move upward , since the direciton and intensity of radiation change due to relativistic aberration and doppler effect ( cf .",

    "<S> radiative transfer equation in an accretion disk wind is examined analytically and numerically under the plane - parallel approximation in the subrelativistic regime of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the wind vertical velocity . </S>",
    "<S> emergent intensity is analytically obtained for the case of a large optical depth , where the flow speed and the source function are almost constant . the usual limb - darkening effect , which depends on the direction cosine at the zero - optical depth surface , </S>",
    "<S> does not appear , since the source function is constant . </S>",
    "<S> because of the vertical motion of winds , however , the emergent intensity exhibits the _ velocity - dependent _ limb - darkening effect , which comes from the doppler and aberration effects . </S>",
    "<S> radiative moments and emergent intensity are also numerically obtained . </S>",
    "<S> when the flow speed is small ( @xmath2 ) , the radiative structure resembles to that of the static atmosphere , where the source function is proportional to the optical depth , and the usual limb - darkening effect exists . </S>",
    "<S> when the flow speed becomes large , on the other hand , the flow speed attains the constant terminal one , and the velocity - dependent limb - darkening effect appears . we thus carefully treat and estimate the wind luminosity and limb - darkening effect , when we observe an accretion disk wind . </S>"
