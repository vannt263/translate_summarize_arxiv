    "the cosmic rays with energies beyond the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff  @xcite at @xmath5  ev present a challenging outstanding puzzle in astroparticle physics and cosmology  @xcite .",
    "nucleons can not be confined to our galaxy for energies above the  ankle \" , i.e. above 10@xmath6  ev .",
    "this and the absence of a correlation of arrival directions with the galactic plane indicate that , if nucleons are the primary particles of the ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) , these nucleons should be of extragalactic origin .",
    "however , nucleons with energies above @xmath7  ev could not reach earth from a distance beyond 50 to 100 mpc  @xcite because they scatter off the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons with a resonant photoproduction of pions : @xmath8 , where the pion carries away @xmath9 of the original nucleon energy .",
    "the mean free path for this reaction is only @xmath10  mpc .",
    "photons with comparable energy pair - produce electrons and positrons on the radio background and , likewise , can not reach earth from beyond 10 to 40 mpc  @xcite ( although the photon energy - attenuation length is uncertain , due to the uncertainties in the spectrum of the absorbing radio background ) .",
    "there only few known astrophysical sources within those distances that could produce such energetic particles , but they are not located along the arrival directions of observed cosmic rays .",
    "intervening sheets of large scale intense extra galactic magnetic fields ( egmf ) , with intensities @xmath11  g , could provide sufficient angular deflection for protons to explain the lack of observed sources in the directions of arrival of uhecr .",
    "however , recent realistic simulations of the expected large scale egmf , show that strong deflections could only occur when particles cross galaxy clusters . except in the regions close to the virgo ,",
    "perseus and coma clusters the obtained magnetic fields are not larger than 3@xmath12  g  @xcite and the deflections expected are not important ( however see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    whether particles can be emitted with the necessary energies by astrophysical accelerators , such as active galactic nuclei , jets or extended lobes of radio galaxies , or even extended object such as colliding galaxies and clusters of galaxies , is still an open question .",
    "the size and possible magnetic and electric fields of these astrophysical sites make it plausible for them to produce uhecr at most up to energies of @xmath13  ev .",
    "larger emission energies would require a reconsideration of possible acceleration models or sites .",
    "heavy nuclei are an interesting possibility for uhecr primaries , since they could be produced at the sources with larger maximum energies ( proportional to their charges ) and would more easily be deflected by intervening magnetic fields .",
    "on the other hand , both agasa and hires data favor a dominance of light hadrons , consisting with being all protons , in the composition of uhecr above 10@xmath14  ev .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that the inferred composition is sensitive to the interaction models used . assuming a proton plus iron composition , hires stereo data show a constant or slowly changing composition of 80% protons and 20% iron nuclei between 10@xmath15  ev and 10@xmath16  ev .",
    "this is consistent with the change in composition from heavy to light in the 10@xmath17  ev to 10@xmath18  ev range found by hires prototype  @xcite .",
    "hires monocular data show a 90% proton composition between 10@xmath19  ev and 10@xmath20  ev  @xcite .",
    "similar results were found by agasa , which produced bounds on the iron fraction ( again assuming an iron plus proton composition ) of 14  @xmath21% and 30  @xmath22% above 10@xmath23  ev and 10@xmath24  ev respectively , and 1 @xmath25 upper bound of 66% above 10@xmath26  ev  @xcite .",
    "in fact , a galactic component of the uhecr flux , which could be important up to energies 10@xmath14  ev , should consists of heavy nuclei , given the lack of correlation with the galactic plane of events at this energy ( outside the galactic plane , galactic protons would be deflected by a maximum of 15 - 20@xmath27 at this energies  @xcite ) . for nuclei",
    "the dominant energy loss process is photodissociation through scattering with the infra - red background below 10@xmath20  ev  @xcite and with the cmb above @xmath4  ev , and pair creation on the cmb in a small energy interval around 10@xmath20  ev ( at energies for which the typical cmb photon energy in the rest frame of the nucleus is above threshold , i.e. above 1 mev , but below the peak of the giant resonance , 10 - 20 mev )  @xcite .",
    "the typical attenuation length in the energy range 4@xmath28 to @xmath29  ev changes from several 10@xmath30  mpc for iron and silicon to be comparable to that of nucleons for helium  @xcite . at energies above @xmath31  ev , the attenuation length of heavy nuclei decreases and becomes less than 10 mpc at about @xmath32  ev for iron , @xmath33  ev for silicon and @xmath34  ev for carbon ( see for example fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) . in the realistically low egmf of ref .",
    "@xcite , most of the heavy nuclei with @xmath35 ev reaching us from more than 10 mpc away with energies above those mentioned would disintegrate into protons with energy ( @xmath36 ) of the original nucleus energy , where @xmath37 is the atomic number ( this is 1/56 of the original energy for iron nuclei ) .",
    "note also that the same photodissociation processes can destroy heavy nuclei near their sources , if the intensity of the infrared background near the sources is large enough .",
    "one should not forget that all uhecr above @xmath38 ev could be due to extragalactic protons @xcite .",
    "the gzk cutoff at @xmath5  ev seems not to be present in the data of the agasa ground array  @xcite but it appears in the data of the hires air fluorescence detector  @xcite . in any case , there are events above the gzk cutoff , even in the hires data set , and these remain unexplained since the local universe ( @xmath39  mpc ) is devoid of strong candidate sources in the direction the events point to , and also of the large magnetic fields which could deflect the incoming particles significantly .",
    "due to the limited statistics and different systematic errors of both experiments the discrepancy between them is not very significant .",
    "however , the presence or absence of the gzk cutoff remains an open question .",
    "this controversy will be solved conclusively by the pierre auger observatory  @xcite , a hybrid combination of charged particles detectors and fluorescence telescopes , perhaps within the next one or two years .",
    "the analysis of the muon content in air showers has been used by agasa to reject photon dominance in uhecr above 10@xmath14  ev  @xcite . assuming a composition of protons plus photons , agasa quotes upper limits for the photon ratio of 34% , 59% and 63% at 10@xmath14  ev , 10@xmath24  ev and 10@xmath26  ev respectively at the 95% confidence level  @xcite , and even above 10@xmath20  ev they find no indication that the events they observe are mostly photons  @xcite .",
    "also a reanalysis of horizontal showers at haverah park concluded that photons can not constitute more that 50% of the uhecr above 4@xmath28  ev  @xcite .",
    "the gzk process produces pions . from the decay of @xmath40 one obtains neutrinos .",
    "these  gzk neutrinos \" have been extensively studied , from 1969  @xcite onward ( see for example  @xcite and references therein ) , and constitute one of the main high energy signals expected in neutrino telescopes , such as icecube  @xcite anita  @xcite and salsa  @xcite or space based observatories such as euso  @xcite and owl  @xcite . from the decay of @xmath41 we obtain photons ,  gzk photons \" , with about 0.1 of the original proton energy , which have been known to be a subdominant component of the uhecr since the work of wdowczyk _ et al .",
    "_ in the early 1970 s  @xcite . in 1990",
    "it was suggested that if the extragalactic radio background and magnetic fields are small ( @xmath42 g ) gzk photons could dominate over protons and explain the super - gzk events  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the gzk photon flux on extragalactic magnetic fields was later studied in ref .",
    "the argument of ref .",
    "@xcite and its dependence on extragalactic magnetic fields was again discussed  @xcite in connection with the possible correlation of uhecr arrival directions with bl lacertae objects  @xcite . however , to our knowledge , no complete study of the expected fluxes of gzk photons was done so far , including their dependence on the initial proton fluxes , distribution of proton sources and uhecr spectrum , besides intervening backgrounds .    with the advent of the pierre auger observatory",
    ", we expect to have in the near future the high statistic data that may allow to study a subdominant component of uhecr consisting of photons .",
    "the gzk photons provide a complementary handle to gzk neutrinos and other signatures to try to determine the spectrum and composition of the uhecr .",
    "the flux of gzk photons is necessarily correlated with the flux of gzk neutrinos , although the former is affected by the radio background and egmf values which do not affect the latter .    in this paper",
    "we show that if the uhecr are mostly protons , depending on the uhecr spectrum assumed , the slope of the proton flux , distribution of sources and intervening backgrounds , between @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the uhecr above @xmath2 ev and between @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the uhecr above @xmath4 ev are gzk photons , the range being much higher for the agasa spectrum than for the hires spectrum ( see fig .  [ f14 ] ) .",
    "detection of these photons would open the way for uhecr photon astronomy .",
    "detection of a larger photon flux than expected for gzk photons would imply the emission of photons at the source or new physics .",
    "new physics is involved in top - down models , produced as an alternative to acceleration models to explain the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "all of the top - down models predict photon dominance at the highest energies . here",
    ", we estimate the minimum photon fraction top - down models predict , not only assuming the agasa spectrum which these models were originally proposed to explain , but also assuming the hires spectrum .",
    "we show that at high energy , close to 10@xmath20  ev , the maximum expected flux of gzk photons is comparable to ( for the agasa spectrum ) or much smaller than ( for the hires spectrum ) the minimum flux of photons predicted by top - down models which fit the agasa or the hires data ( see fig .  [ f14 ] ) .",
    "we try to minimize the photon ratio predicted by top - down models by assuming that these models explain only the highest energy uhecr ( if they do not explain even those events , the models are irrelevant for uhecr ) .",
    "we show that the photon ratio at energies close to @xmath4 ev is a crucial test for top - down models , since it is always higher than about 0.5 , independently of the uhecr spectrum assumed .",
    "we also show that , surprisingly , in a limited energy range above @xmath4  ev , gzk photons could become the dominant component of the uhecr ( assuming that protons could be accelerated at the source to energies as large as 10@xmath45  ev ) .",
    "this result allows us to fit the agasa data with an original flux of only nucleons .",
    "this seems to contradict previous estimates of the gzk photon flux in which this flux is always subdominant , however one needs to take into account the assumed initial spectrum and intervening radio background and magnetic fields ( for example in ref .",

    "the synchrotron radiation length is smaller than the interaction length for all the egmf values considered ( i.e. even as small as @xmath114  g ) , so the the photon energy is lost into synchrotron radiation as soon the photon pair produces .",
