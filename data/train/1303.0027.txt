    "the measurement uncertainties of @xmath56 in our sample ( shown as the error bars in the upper panel of figure 2 ) have a median value of 10% .",
    "we estimated intrinsic half - light radius @xmath7 and systematic uncertainties from simulations as well .",
    "because of the psf broadening and lower surface brightness at larger sizes , the observed ( or measured ) @xmath56 is a complex function of galaxy size , brightness , and intrinsic profile .",

    "we started with the galfit parameters obtained above , and considered four parameters here , including the srsic index @xmath69 , the axis ratio @xmath70 , brightness , and @xmath7 .",
    "based on these parameters , we produced a large set of mock galaxies in a grid of @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath57 , and @xmath7 .",
    "the values of @xmath69 were chosen to be 1 , 1.5 , and 2 times the measured @xmath69 from our galaxies , and the values of @xmath70 were chosen to be 1 , 2/3 , 1/3 times the measured @xmath70 from our galaxies .",
    "this is because the psf broadening could largely decrease @xmath69 and increase @xmath70 in low - resolution images .",
    "the luminosity coverage ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath7 coverage ( @xmath72 ) that we chose are roughly consistent with the actual coverage of our galaxy sample .",
    "the mock galaxies were oversampled so that their @xmath7 sizes were at least 20 pixels .",
    "then they were convolved with psf images and rebinned to match the pixel scales of our @xmath1 images .",
    "finally , each of the rebinned mock galaxies was placed at many ( @xmath73 ) random positions in the blank regions of our science images .",
    "the @xmath56 of this mock galaxy is the median @xmath56 value measured at these random positions .",
    "figure 3 shows part of our simulation results .",
    "it illustrates the measured @xmath56 as a function of @xmath7 at four different magnitudes .",
    "it clearly shows that at small sizes , @xmath56 is significantly larger than @xmath7 due to the psf broadening . at large sizes",
    ", however , @xmath56 starts to fall short of @xmath7 , because we start to loose low surface brightness pixels at large sizes by detection .",
    "this happens at smaller sizes for fainter galaxies . at the faintest magnitude @xmath74 mag",
    ", @xmath56 will never exceed @xmath9 in our images , regardless of @xmath7 . on the other hand , if faint galaxies are always small , as seen in deeper @xmath1 images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their @xmath56 should not be significantly smaller than @xmath7 ( e.g. @xmath75 at @xmath74 mag in figure 3 ) .",
    "note that figure 3 is similar to figure 4 in @xcite .",
    "another simple way to correct for psf broadening is to estimate @xmath7 in quadrature , i.e. , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the psf radius .",
    "figure 3 shows that this equation is a good approximation at small sizes and/or high luminosities ( green dashed lines ) , but it underestimates @xmath7 elsewhere .",
    "we used the relations in figure 3 to estimate intrinsic sizes and associated systematic uncertainties for our galaxies .",
    "the results are shown in the lower panel of figure 2 .",
    "the error bars include both measurement and systematic uncertainties , with systematic uncertainties being the dominant factors for most galaxies . with this correction , the values of @xmath7 for our galaxies at @xmath78 mag range from @xmath79 ( @xmath80 kpc ) to @xmath81 ( @xmath82 kpc ) , with a median value of @xmath11 ( @xmath66 kpc ) .",

    "the median @xmath7 value for the whole sample of 67 galaxies is @xmath84 ( @xmath85 kpc ) , if we assume that the faint galaxies at @xmath67 mag in this sample have @xmath7 smaller than this median value .",
    "the galaxy sizes in our sample roughly agree with those of high - redshift laes and lbgs with similar luminosities in the previous literature .",
    "for example , @xcite found that the average @xmath56 for a sample of luminous laes at @xmath86 is @xmath87 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the size of galaxies evolves slowly at high redshift .",
    "this is the reason that high - redshift galaxies have a similar size range .",
    "@xcite found , however , that laes have a roughly constant size in the redshift range of @xmath93 , and do not show a size - redshift relation .",
    "while our sample does not have a large redshift coverage , our galaxy sizes are well consistent with those in their sample .",
    "figure 2 shows that brighter objects appear to have larger @xmath56 , meaning that more luminous galaxies tend to have larger physical sizes .",

    "their relation largely depends on the galaxies fainter than 19.5 mag , as seen in figure 9 of their paper . in the brighter galaxies , their @xmath56 ( or @xmath7 ) shows less of a trend with luminosity , as also pointed out by @xcite .",
    "in fact , our best fit to the galaxies with @xmath101 mag ( dash - dotted line in figure 2 ) gives a nearly flat slope of @xmath102 , suggesting little correlation between size and luminosity in the most luminous galaxies .",
    "it should be pointed out that the relation between the measured size and luminosity could be affected by systematic effects shown in figure 3 .",

    "we have taken into account these effects in figure 2 .",
    "these effects do not have significant impact on the size - luminosity relation in figure 2 : the corrected relation does not become flatter , because this relation also depends on other factors such as the source distribution .    finally , we point out that the size - luminosity relation in our sample is not affected by a possible selection effect , i.e. , that we may have missed some faint galaxies with large sizes during galaxy candidate selection .",
    "the reason is that these galaxies were selected in optical images .",

    "the @xmath14 parameter , or the second - order moment of the brightest 20% of the galaxy , is similar to the concentration @xmath105 , and measures how the galaxy light is concentrated @xcite .",

    "we then measured @xmath112 at each position , and calculated the standard deviations of these parameters .",
    "the standard deviations , or measurement uncertainties , are shown as the error bars in figure 5 .",
    "these uncertainties include the effects of s / n in the images , but do not account for systematic uncertainties associated with sparse spatial sampling of distant small and faint sources which we investigate in section 3.2.2 .",
    "compared to low - redshift galaxies , our galaxies are located in a much narrower range in the parameter space ( figure 5 ; see also figures 6 and 7 ) .",
    "they appear to be less concentrated and more asymmetric , and their light distribution is more even .",
    "this is likely because the measured quantities have been substantially affected by the low resolution of our images .",
    "for example , @xmath105 has a narrow range between @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and there is a lack of highly - concentrated values of @xmath105 . due to the low spatial resolution , the measurements of @xmath107 and @xmath108 are not robust . in particular , for highly - concentrated galaxies , the inner radius @xmath108 is smaller than one pixel and is likely significantly overestimated , so @xmath105 is underestimated .",
    "we will discuss these systematic effects using simulations below .      in order to address how the low spatial resolution of the images affect the measurements of the parameters @xmath112 , or how reliable these parameters are ( for @xmath0 galaxies ) , we ran a series of slightly different simulations than we did in section 3.1 .",
    "here we started with low - redshift real galaxies instead of model galaxies , because model galaxies are smooth , and do not cover a large range of the parameter space .",
    "for example , @xmath109 is zero for a noiseless single - component model galaxy .",
    "we chose to use the galaxy images in the library of galsvm @xcite .",
    "these low - redshift galaxies are large and bright , and their images have high s / n ratios .",
    "we randomly selected 1/10 of the galaxies from this library .",
    "we then visually inspected these galaxies and removed those with possible foreground stars .",
    "our final sample consists of 740 galaxies .",
    "their morphological parameters are shown in figure 6 ( the scale in this figure is very different from that in figure 5 ) .",
    "these galaxies cover a large range of the parameter space of @xmath112 .    by rescaling these real galaxies in size and flux",
    ", we produced a large set of mock galaxies with high spatial resolution at @xmath0 , in the grid of magnitude ( @xmath113 ) and size ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "the mock galaxies were then convolved with the psf images and rebinned to match the pixel scales of our @xmath1 images .",
    "finally , the rebinned mock galaxies were placed at many random positions in the blank regions of the @xmath1 images , and their morphological parameters were measured .",
    "figure 7 shows an example of our simulation results ( black dots ) . in this example",
    ", we preserved the relative magnitudes and sizes of the galaxies , and scaled the sample as a whole so that the scaled sample covers a similar range of magnitude and size as our @xmath0 galaxies do .",
    "this is the best way to preserve the scatter of source distributions in the parameter space .",
    "the comparison between figure 6 and figure 7 shows that the parameters of these mock galaxies measured in our low - resolution images are quite different from the intrinsic values : they occupy a smaller range of the parameter space .",
    "for example , the mock galaxies are significantly less concentrated in our images ( @xmath115 in figure 7 @xmath116 @xmath117 in figure 6 ) .",
    "as we already mentioned , @xmath105 is significantly underestimated for highly - concentrated galaxies because @xmath108 is much smaller than one pixel in our @xmath1 images .",
    "since @xmath14 also describes galaxy concentration , it is underestimated as well ( less negative here ) .",
    "this was also noticed by @xcite . due to the low spatial resolution",
    ", our images can not resolve subtle structures , so the mock galaxies show lower @xmath104 coefficients , or more evenly distributed light .",
    "the limitation of @xmath104 has been reported ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also because of the low resolution , the @xmath109 values of the mock galaxies are much larger .    in figure 7",
    "we also plot our @xmath0 galaxies ( red circles ) .",
    "their morphological measurements are directly taken from figure 5 .",
    "their positions in the parameter space are quite consistent with those of the mock galaxies .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath0 galaxies are possibly not intrinsically less concentrated , more asymmetric , or less even in light distribution .",
    "it is simply because our images do not meet one critical requirement to use these methods , i.e. , large galaxy sizes compared to the psf size , so our measurements have been systematically biased by the low - resolution images . on the other hand ,",
    "these parameters are probably still meaningful for galaxies at similar redshifts , if they are measured in the @xmath1 images of the same depth and pixel size , i.e. , for example , intrinsically more concentrated galaxies are still more concentrated in our @xmath1 images as measured by @xmath105 .",
    "we demonstrate this using the simulations of the 740 mock galaxies shown in figure 7 .",
    "we first choose the galaxy pairs whose difference of the _ measured _ @xmath105 ( or any of @xmath118 ) are larger than @xmath119 ( @xmath120 is the measurement uncertainty ) . among these galaxy pairs",
    ", we further select the pairs in which the galaxy has larger _ intrinsic _ @xmath105 than the other one still has larger _ measured _ @xmath105 in the low - resolution images .",
    "the fraction of such pairs for @xmath105 is 93% .",
    "the fractions for @xmath121 are 70% , 98% , and 92% , respectively . if we increase @xmath119 to @xmath122 above , the fractions for @xmath118 increase to 97% , 78% , 100% , and 95% , respectively .",
    "this suggests that for the vast majority of galaxies , the low resolution of our @xmath1 images does not change their relative values of these morphological parameters .",
    "we emphasize that the _ absolute _ measured values of these parameters for @xmath0 galaxies in @xmath1 images are not to be compared to the _ absolute _ measured parameters of lower - redshift galaxies .",
    "the morphological parameters correlate with each other .",
    "we have seen such correlations in low - redshift galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure 6 ,",
    "the dashed lines are the best linear fits to the 740 low - redshift galaxies , and show the relations among @xmath112 .",
    "as expected , these parameters are correlated with each other .",
    "the moment @xmath14 is correlated well with @xmath105 , @xmath109 , and @xmath104 .",
    "both @xmath14 and @xmath105 describe how the galaxy light is concentrated , and they are strongly correlated by definition .",
    "the relations between @xmath14 and @xmath109 & @xmath104 reflect that more concentrated galaxies have more rotationally symmetric profiles and more unevenly distributed light . the gini coefficient @xmath104 is correlated with @xmath105 and @xmath109 , in addition to @xmath14 .",
    "its relations with @xmath105 and @xmath109 indicate that galaxies with more concentrated or more rotationally symmetric profiles tend to have more unevenly distributed light .",
    "these relations still exist among the 740 mock galaxies in figure 7 , since the relative values of the parameters are preserved as we discussed above . on the other hand ,",
    "some relations become weaker with larger scatter . for example , the relations between @xmath105 and @xmath123 are much flatter , mainly because the coverage of @xmath105 has shifted from @xmath124 to @xmath125 .    in figure 5 , the red dashed lines show the correlations of @xmath112 for our @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "these correlations are consistent with those for the mock galaxies in figure 7 .",
    "in particular , the relations between @xmath14 and @xmath126 are still fairly well preserved , and the relations between @xmath105 and @xmath123 are as weak as shown in figure 7 .",
    "we will see in the next subsection that these corrections for relatively bright galaxies in our sample are better with smaller scatter ( figure 10 ) .",
    "therefore , although our measured @xmath112 of the @xmath0 galaxies are systematically biased by the low - resolution images , these parameters , when interpreted carefully , are still somewhat meaningful for galaxies measured in the @xmath1 images of the same depth and pixel size .",
    "one of the interesting morphological topics is to study interacting / merging systems , which traces hierarchical mass assembly in the cdm scenario .",
    "a close visual inspection of figure 1 shows that some galaxies are clearly extended with interacting or multi - component features . at lower redshift",
    ", these systems can be identified by pair counts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the @xmath13 system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the @xmath104 and @xmath14 parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "galaxies at @xmath0 are faint and small , so it is difficult to properly distinguish regular and interacting / merging systems .",
    "although we have derived morphological parameters @xmath112 , they were biased , and their ability to identify merging systems at @xmath0 has never been examined .",
    "therefore , we identify interacting / merging systems by visual inspection .",
    "visual classification was the earliest way for galaxy classification , and in many cases is still the best way to identify merging systems at high redshift .",
    "we considered the following two types of galaxies as candidate interacting / merging systems : 1 ) galaxies with two or more distinct cores ; and 2 ) galaxies with extended / elongated features and/or long tails .",
    "we identified these systems in 24 relatively bright ( @xmath6 mag ) galaxies . for fainter galaxies ,",
    "our images are not deep enough to properly identify all faint components or extended features .",
    "figures 8 and 9 show 12 galaxies that were identified as interacting systems with @xmath6 mag .",
    "figure 8 shows 11 galaxies in the stacked ( @xmath127 ) images , and figure 9 shows the @xmath36 lae ( no . 62 ) in the two @xmath52 bands .",

    "six of them clear show double or multiple clumps , including no .",
    "4 , 24 , 34 , 49 , 62 , and 67 .",
    "they usually have one bright core and one or more fainter clumps .",
    "62 and 67 are particularly interesting .",
    "62 in figure 9 has almost two identical components , and no .",
    "67 has three widely - separated cores .",
    "more discussion is given in the next subsection .",
    "another 3 galaxies , including no .",
    "36 , 58 , and 61 , do not clearly show multiple clumps , but have long tails like tidal tails seen in low - redshift merging galaxies .",
    "the rest of the 12 systems ( no .",
    "15 , 44 , and 47 ) do not show multiple components or tails , but they are rather extended and elongated .",
    "they could be in the end of the merging process .",
    "we estimate the fraction of mergers among galaxies with @xmath128 mag .",
    "the fraction is 50% , or 38% if we exclude the three galaxies that do not show multiple components or tails .",
    "the fraction is even higher in the galaxies with @xmath129 mag .",
    "we have 18 galaxies in this magnitude range , and 10 of them are mergers .",
    "the fraction of mergers is 56% , or 39% if we exclude the three galaxies mentioned above .",
    "this is consistent with the fractions in the brightest galaxies at low redshift of @xmath130 .",
    "for example , the fraction of mergers in the @xmath131 mag galaxy sample of @xcite is 40%50% .",
    "the typical fraction in the brightest galaxies in the sample of @xcite is also @xmath132% .",
    "the merger fraction in fainter galaxies is smaller , because merger systems consist of multiple components , and usually have stronger sfrs and uv emission . for the galaxies fainter than @xmath133 mag in our sample , our images are deep enough to identify double - core systems with comparable emission .",
    "we find that these systems are very rare at @xmath134 mag .",
    "studies in deeper fields have indicated a low merger fraction in low - luminosity galaxies .",

    "67 is a lae at @xmath138 .",

    "the scatter in the relations is smaller for these bright galaxies with @xmath128 mag .",
    "there are two explanations .",
    "one is that bright galaxies have higher s / n ratios and cover more pixels in the @xmath1 images , so their morphological measurements are more robust .",
    "the other one is that galaxies with different luminosities occupy slightly different parameter space , so a sample covering a smaller luminosity range shows a smaller scatter in figure 10 .",
    "the real reason is very likely the combination of the two . in any case ,",
    "figure 10 strengthens our earlier conclusion on the existence of strong correlations among @xmath112 for our @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "in this section we will study the ly@xmath2  morphology of laes using our ground - based narrow - band images .",
    "we will not measure structure and morphology for individual galaxies , since they are mostly point - like objects in the ground - based images .",
    "although these images have excellent psf sizes of @xmath143 , the psf sizes are still much larger those of the @xmath1 images .",
    "therefore , we will focus on ly@xmath2  halos around laes , which could extend many arcsec from the objects .",
    "we will also compare the positions of ly@xmath2  emission with those of uv continuum emission , and find any possible positional difference between the two .",
    "because of the resonant scattering of ly@xmath2  photons by neutral hydrogen , ly@xmath2   emission could form large diffuse ly@xmath2  halos around high - redshift galaxies .",
    "@xcite first found very extended ly@xmath2  halos in a sample of luminous galaxies at @xmath144 .",

    "they were able to find large ly@xmath2  emission halos ( @xmath146 kpc ) in the stacked images of all sub - samples of their galaxies .",
    "they further claimed that all lbgs would be classified as laes or ly@xmath2  blobs , if imaging data are deep enough to detect ly@xmath2  halos .",
    "@xcite confirmed the existence of extended ly@xmath2  halos around @xmath147 galaxies .",

    "they stacked narrow - band ( ly@xmath2 ) images for each sub - sample , and found that all stacked images show extended ( @xmath149 kpc ) ly@xmath2   emission halos .",
    "recently @xcite found that the existence of ly@xmath2  halos around laes is not convincing .",
    "they also used a large sample of a few hundred laes at @xmath150 and 3.1 .",
    "they paid particular attention to systematic effects from large - radius psf and large - scale flat fielding , etc . when these effects were taken into account",
    ", they did not find strong evidence of extended ly@xmath2   halos in the stacked narrow - band images at either redshift .",
    "they tried a few ways to reconcile the discrepancy between their results and the previous results , yet the reason of the discrepancy is still not clear .    stacking of narrow - band images has not been done for @xmath0 galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "cosmological simulations have predicted the existence of extended ly@xmath2  emission around @xmath0 galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , by including the resonant scattering of ly@xmath2  photons in both circumgalactic media and intergalactic medium ( igm ) , @xcite showed that the ly@xmath2  emitting halo in a high - redshift galaxy can extend up to 1 mpc .",
    "they further pointed out that such halos could be detected by stacking 100 @xmath3 laes in 4-hr exposure narrow - band images in the sxds .",
    "here we combine the narrow - band ( ly@xmath2 ) images of laes at @xmath3 and 6.5 .    in order to detect diffuse ly@xmath2  halos around laes , we made use of all the known laes at @xmath3 and 6.5 in the sdf and sxds fields from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the narrow - band images were taken with the subaru telescope .",
    "the total integration time in the nb816 and nb921 bands are 10 and 15 hr for the sdf @xcite , and @xmath54 hr and @xmath510 hr ( depth slightly varies among five pointings ) for the sxds @xcite .",
    "the data reduction of the sdf images were presented in section 2 of paper i. the reduction of the sxds images were done in the same way .",
    "these narrow - band images have great depth with excellent psf sizes of @xmath151 .",
    "we rejected a small number of galaxies that are either very faint or blended with nearby bright objects .",
    "the final sample contains 43 laes at @xmath3 and 40 laes at @xmath35",
    ".    to stack these images , we first cut image stamps for all individual objects .",
    "we then re - sampled image stamps , so that the objects are in the centers of the images . after all other objects in the images were masked out , we co - added ( average ) the images with sigma - clipping ( @xmath44 rejection ) .",
    "figure 11 shows the stacked narrow - band ly@xmath2  images at the two redshifts .",
    "we did not subtract away continuum images .",
    "as we showed in paper i , our laes have ly@xmath2   ews greater than 20  .",
    "the median ew value is 80  , so their narrow - band photometry is completely dominated by the ly@xmath2  emission .",
    "subtracting continuum images would significantly increase the background noise . in the above procedure",
    "we did not scale the objects to the same magnitude either , since we do not know how the sb of the ly@xmath2  halos scales with the total ly@xmath2  flux in a lae .",
    "we performed a series of tests by stacking the images in different ways , including image stacking with median , with objects scaled to the same magnitude , and with bright objects only .",
    "the results are all very similar to the images shown in figure 11 .",
    "our stacked images of laes reach a depth of roughly @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) in both bands ( see also figure 12 ) .",
    "we should point out that this depth is shallower than what we predicted assuming that the noise goes down with the square root of the image number .",
    "the reason is that the input images are not purely blank images , whose noise is dominated by background poisson noise .",
    "these images are extremely deep and crowded , so laes have many nearby objects .",
    "although we were able to mask out the bright pixels of the nearby objects , we could not remove the light outside these pixels that may extend many pixels away .",
    "when we combine many images , these nearby objects contribute significant unavoidable noise to the co - added images .",
    "figure 11 clearly shows that the stacked ly@xmath2  emission is compact at the both redshifts , and do not show extended diffuse halos . as a reference",
    ", we also show in figure 11 the stacked images of stars ( point sources ) .",
    "the stars are chosen to be separated , bright , but not saturated , in the same narrow - band images .",
    "they are combined in the same way as we did for laes .",
    "figure 12 shows the radial profiles of the stacked laes ( solid lines with error bars ) as well as the profiles of the stars ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the ly@xmath2   profiles roughly follow the psf profiles , and their sb reach zero at @xmath154 . in the upper panel ,",
    "the profile fwhm of the stacked @xmath3 lae and star are @xmath155 and @xmath156 , respectively . in the lower panel",
    "the two fwhm values are @xmath157 for the @xmath35 lae and @xmath158 for the star .",
    "the lae profiles are broader than the psf sizes by @xmath159% , and exhibit slightly longer tails than the psf profiles do .",
    "this is simply because galaxies are not point sources , and indicates that the ly@xmath2  emission is resolved but not very extended . in the previous sections we show that our laes have a range of sizes in their rest - frame uv emission .",
    "@xcite stacked broad - band hudf images for @xmath160 lbgs and found that the galaxy sb profiles are apparently broader than the psf profiles .",
    "@xcite found that two @xmath161 laes have large sizes in ly@xmath2  than in uv continuum .",
    "so the slightly broader ly@xmath2  sb profiles compared to the psf are just the nature of galaxies , and are not likely caused by diffuse ly@xmath2  halos predicted or found in previous studies .",
    "the @xmath162 profile seems to exhibit slightly more extended radius than its psf profile .",
    "given the @xmath153 limit of @xmath163 , its sb is still consistent with zero at @xmath154 .",
    "therefore , figure 12 does not show convincing evidence of extended ly@xmath2  halos .",
    "it is difficult to answer whether our stacked images are deep enough to detect ly@xmath2  halos if they do exist at the two redshifts .",
    "our images are certainly deep enough to detect the lbg halos at @xmath147 reported by @xcite and the lae halos at @xmath148 in @xcite .",
    "the depth to detect @xmath0 lae halos is observationally unknown . from cosmological simulations , @xcite predicted ly@xmath2  halo sizes in @xmath162 laes .",
    "they found two characteristic scales for the halos .",
    "the inner steeper one extends to @xmath164 , and the outer flatter one extends to a few tens of arcsec .",
    "while our images are not deep enough to detect the outer halos , they are almost deep enough to detect the inner scale halos as seen in figure 3 of @xcite , where the ly@xmath2  radial profiles are shown for laes in dark matter halos of @xmath165 .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the size of diffuse ly@xmath2  emission also depends on the mass of dark matter halo .",
    "if the average mass of the dark matter halos in our laes is smaller than @xmath166 , our current data may not be able to detect the diffuse ly@xmath2  emission .",
    "it is also likely that the ly@xmath2  halos ( if they exist ) have been diluted to a much lower level during the construction of the stacked images .",
    "the stacked images can properly recover ly@xmath2  halos only when halos are smoothly and symmetrically distributed around galaxies .",
    "if halos are highly asymmetric and/or clumpy , the emission of halos will be significantly diluted in average stacked images , and could totally disappear in median stacked images . from the observations of @xmath167 quasars or cosmological simulations ,",
    "we know that the distribution of igm at @xmath167 is inhomogeneous ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the distribution of igm affects the shape of ly@xmath2  halos ( via resonant scattering ) , the distribution of ly@xmath2   halos is also likely asymmetric and clumpy .",
    "finally , it is possible that these laes do not have extended ly@xmath2  halos , or that their halo emission is not as strong as predicted by @xcite , especially when dust is taken into account ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite did not consider dust in their simulations .",
    "we know that high - redshift laes are not free of dust .",
    "in particular , the brightest galaxies may exhibit significant dust extinction , as implied by their uv colors ( see paper i ) .",
    "when ly@xmath2  photons are resonantly scattered by dusty neutral hydrogen , the ly@xmath2  emission is substantially reduced @xcite .",
    "the reduction is more severe at larger distance from the object , because photons at larger distance need to pass through more dust before they escape .",
    "this process would significantly reduce the visibility of possible diffuse ly@xmath2  emission , and makes it much more difficult to detect it . a much larger sample of laes",
    "is needed to answer this question .      the comparison between the positions of uv continuum and ly@xmath2  emission provides useful information on how ly@xmath2  photons escape from a galaxy .",
    "ly@xmath2  and uv continuum photons are usually come from the same star - forming regions , although ly@xmath2  photons are likely more sensitive to the regions with more recent star - forming activity .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , ly@xmath2emission is complicated by resonant scattering and igm absorption .",
    "so the observed position of ly@xmath2  emission could be different from the position of uv continuum emission .",
    "for example , a large positional difference has been found in a @xmath168 galaxy @xcite . due to the small sizes of high - redshift galaxies , current ground - based observations",
    "are not able to detect these positional differences .",
    "we rely on @xmath1 , which has observed a large number of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "@xmath1 observations were mostly made for rest - frame uv continuum emission , and there is usually no suitable @xmath1 narrow - band filters for ly@xmath2  emission .",
    "one example for the @xmath1 imaging of ly@xmath2  emission is the work of @xcite , who observed the ly@xmath2  emission of a small sample of @xmath169 laes with a narrow - band filter .",
    "they did not find strong evidence of positional misalignment between uv and ly@xmath2  emission .",
    "we used our large sample of laes to search for possible positional offsets between uv and ly@xmath2  emission at @xmath3 and 6.5 .",
    "we used our @xmath1 images as uv continuum images and subaru narrow - band images as ly@xmath2  images .",
    "as mentioned above , the narrow - band images have excellent psf fwhm sizes around @xmath151 . during the construction of the @xmath1 images ( paper i )",
    ", we have matched the coordinates of the @xmath1 images to those of the optical images . to avoid any large - scale variation ,",
    "we refine the coordinates of the @xmath1 images . for each lae",
    ", we found 1020 nearby objects that are relatively bright and round .",
    "we then matched the positions of the nearby objects in the two sets of images .",
    "the typical refinement was smaller than the size of one pixel ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the object positions , derived from the distribution of the nearby objects , is about the size of 12 pixels .",
    "we plot the ly@xmath2  positions on top of the uv continuum positions .",
    "figure 13 shows a few examples of bright galaxies .",
    "the red profiles are the contours of the uv emission sb , and the green crosses indicate the positions ( and @xmath153 uncertainties ) of the ly@xmath2  emission .    for the majority of the laes in our sample",
    ", the positions of the uv continuum and ly@xmath2  emission agree with each other .",
    "in particular , we do not find positional misalignment at a significance level of @xmath170 among almost all compact and round laes .",
    "object no .",
    "3 in figure 13 is a typical example , in which the center of the ly@xmath2  emission is close to the center of the continuum emission . for the merging / interacting systems ,",
    "however , we see significant positional differences .",
    "figure 13 shows the examples of these systems . they exhibit a variety of ly@xmath2  positions relative to the peak positions of the uv continuum emission : 1 ) ly@xmath2  positions close to the positions of the brightest components in the uv images , including galaxies no .",
    "15 , 47 , and 61 ; 2 ) ly@xmath2  positions close to the positions of the fainter components or merger tails in the uv images , including no",
    ". 14 , 44 , and 58 ; 3 ) ly@xmath2  positions are somewhere between the positions of the bright and faint components , but closer to the bright components , including no . 4 and 49 .",
    "62 and 67 are again interesting .",
    "the ly@xmath2  position of no .",
    "62 is roughly in the middle of the two similarly bright components .",
    "67 does not show three distinct ly@xmath2  emission clumps , as its uv emission does .",
    "instead , it shows a single bright ly@xmath2  emission core with some extended features .",
    "the ly@xmath2  center is not at any of the three uv clumps .",
    "it is between the left and central clumps , and slightly closer to the central one .",
    "our results suggest that in compact galaxies the observed location of ly@xmath2   emission does not deviate from its original position , while in merging / interacting systems , the observed ly@xmath2  location could be significantly different from its original position , without preferential positions of offsets .",
    "if the final location of ly@xmath2  emission is determined by the process of resonant scattering , our results can be explained by the interstellar medium ( ism ) distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in a non - disturbed galaxy , the ism distribution is relatively symmetric around the object ( not necessarily uniform , it could be clumpy ) .",
    "the random scattering of photons does not have preferred directions , so the observed location is still close to its original location . in an interacting system ,",
    "the ism is re - distributed by merging activity .",
    "the distribution of the disturbed ism is therefore not symmetric any more .",
    "this results in an offset of the observed ly@xmath2  position .",
    "this result could have an impact on spectroscopy of bright lbgs at @xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while most of the positional offsets in our sample are smaller than @xmath136 , at least two are around @xmath171 .",
    "if one uses a @xmath172 slit to identify their ly@xmath2  emission lines , based on the positions of continuum emission , one could miss them due to the large offsets .",
    "however , glaxies with such large offsets are very rare , so this result will not largely reduce the success rate of identifying ly@xmath2  lines in lbgs .",
    "the comparison in section 3.1 shows that the sizes of our galaxies are consistent with those of bright @xmath0 laes and lbgs in previous studies .",
    "this disagrees with the claim of @xcite that laes are more compact than lbgs .",
    "this is likely because the @xcite sample is very small while laes have a large range of sizes .",
    "it is indeed difficult to make proper comparisons without a large sample , as the galaxy size depends on redshift and luminosity .",
    "most of our galaxies are laes .",
    "another large lae sample is the @xmath3 lae sample by @xcite , who observed a number of laes at @xmath3 with the @xmath1 acs f814w filter .",
    "although this filter includes ly@xmath2  emission , it is so wide that its emission is dominated by uv continuum .",
    "they found that the average size of the sample is @xmath88 , similar to ours . among photometrically - selected lbg samples at @xmath0 ,",
    "a recent large sample is the sample of @xcite .",
    "this sample contains a number of bright ( as well as faint ) lbgs at @xmath173 in the candels field .",
    "the sizes of these galaxies are well consistent with those of our galaxies at the same luminosities .",
    "therefore , we conclude that laes and lbgs with similar luminosities have similar physical sizes .    in this paper ( and paper i ) , galaxies found by the narrow - band technique are defined as laes and those found by the dropout technique are defined as lbgs .",
    "as we discussed in paper i , this classification only reflects the methodology that we apply to select galaxies .",
    "it does not mean that the two types of galaxies are intrinsically different . in section 5.3 of paper",
    "i , when we derived the uv continuum luminosity function of laes , we used another popular definition of laes based on the ly@xmath2  ew , i.e. , a galaxy is a lae if its ly@xmath2  ew is greater than 20  . with this definition ,",
    "almost all the galaxies in our sample are laes .",
    "this definition is physically more meaningful , but observationally difficult , because one can easily obtain a flux - limited sample , not a ew - limited sample .",
    "we have 16 lbgs ( former definition ) in our sample .",
    "they are not typical lbgs",
    ". they are spectroscopically confirmed , and thus only represent those with strong ly@xmath2   emission . in paper",
    "i we found that our laes and lbgs are indistinguishable in many aspects of the ly@xmath2  and uv continuum properties . in this paper",
    ", we further found that these laes and lbgs have similar physical sizes and morphological parameters .",
    "this confirms one of our conclusions in paper i that laes are a subset of lbgs with strong ly@xmath2  emission lines .",
    "this paper is the second in a series presenting the physical properties of a large sample of spectroscopically - confirmed galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "the sample consists of 51 laes and 16 lbgs , and represents the most luminous galaxies in terms of ly@xmath2  luminosity ( for laes ) or uv continuum luminosity ( for lbgs ) in this redshift range . in paper",
    "i we derived various properties of rest - frame uv continuum and ly@xmath2  emission . in this paper",
    "we have conducted a detailed structural and morphological study of the galaxies using deep @xmath1 near - ir images and subaru narrow - band images . in order to measure the morphology of rest - frame uv continuum emission",
    ", we constructed a stacked @xmath1 image for each object by combining its @xmath52- and @xmath41-band images .",
    "uv morphology was then measured for those with @xmath174 detections ( roughly corresponding to @xmath10 mag ) in the stacked @xmath1 images .",
    "we have used half - light radius to describe the sizes of galaxies .",
    "the intrinsic sizes @xmath7 ( at @xmath10 mag ) in our sample , after correction for psf broadening , are from @xmath79 ( @xmath175 kpc ) to @xmath81 ( @xmath82 kpc ) , with a median value of @xmath11 ( @xmath50.9 kpc ) .",
    "these values are consistent with those of bright , photometrically - selected lbgs at similar redshifts .",
    "additionally , more luminous galaxies tend to have larger sizes , exhibiting a weak size - luminosity relation @xmath12",
    ". the slope 0.14 is significantly flatter than those in fainter lbg samples .",
    "our objects show a wide range of morphology in the @xmath1 images , including compact galaxies and double / multiple component systems .",
    "the brightest galaxies in the sample have a large fraction of merging / interacting systems .",
    "the fraction of mergers reaches @xmath176% at @xmath6 mag .",
    "we have tried to describe the structure and morphology of our @xmath0 galaxies using nonparametric methods , including the @xmath13 system , the gini and @xmath14 parameters . compared to low - redshift galaxies ,",
    "these galaxies occupy a smaller range in the parameter space of @xmath112 .",
    "our simulations show that the measurements of these parameters have been systematically biased due to the low resolution of the @xmath1 images . on the other hand , the relative values of these morphological parameters",
    "are likely preserved for the vast majority of galaxies .",
    "in addition , we found all expected correlations among @xmath112 for the @xmath0 galaxies .",
    "these suggest that the parameters probably still meaningful for galaxies at similar redshifts , if they are measured in the @xmath1 images of the same depth and pixel size .",
    "we , for the first time , searched for ly@xmath2  emission halos around @xmath0 galaxies in narrow - band images .",
    "we combined a large number of narrow - band images for laes at @xmath3 and 6.5 , respectively .",
    "the stacked images reached a depth of @xmath177 ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "we did not find evidence of extended diffuse ly@xmath2  emission as predicted by cosmological simulations .",
    "it is possible that our images are still not deep enough to detect ly@xmath2  emission halos , or that the ly@xmath2  halo emission has been diluted to a much lower level during the construction of the stacked images .",
    "it is also possible that the halo emission is not as strong as predicted .",
    "a much larger lae sample is needed to solve this question .",
    "we also investigated positional differences between the rest - frame uv continuum emission and ly@xmath2  emission in laes , using the @xmath1 images and optical narrow - band images .",
    "while in compact laes the two positions are well consistent , in some merging galaxies show significant positional differences , with no preferred directions of offsets .",
    "it was explained by the distribution of the disturbed ism .",
