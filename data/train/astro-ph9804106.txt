    "mass distribution at high redshifts is being a hot subject of the large scale structure study . data of various objects at moderate and high redshifts , in particular , clusters of galaxies , are becoming available for probing the formation and evolution of structures and for discriminating among popular dark matter models ( e.g. jing & fang 1994 ; eke , cole & frenk 1996 ; bahcall , fan & cen 1997 ; kitayama & suto 1997 ) . considering that quasars are the most distant among various luminous objects ,",
    "they have also been applied in this approach ( e.g. bi & fang 1997 ) .    however , as a mass tracer of the cosmic matter field , quasars are still playing a role different from clusters of galaxies .",
    "the problem stems from so - called `` bias '' .",
    "clusters are a biased tracer of the mass distribution .",
    "the correlation amplitude of clusters is believed to be much higher than that of the underlying matter and increases strongly with the cluster richness ( bahcall & soneira 1983 ) .",
    "this bias is plausibly explained by the mechanism that the observed clusters are identified as massive collapsed halos of the density field ( kaiser 1984 ) .",
    "that is , the bias of clusters is completely determined by the gravitational parameters , like mass @xmath4 and virial radius @xmath5 used to identify the halos . with this approach",
    ", a detailed confrontation can be made between theories and the observations of clusters .",
    "quasars may also be biased tracer of the mass distribution .",
    "recent observations indicate that the correlation amplitude of quasars may also be different from the underlying dark matter ( mo & fang 1993 ; komberg , kravtsov & lukash 1994 ; croom & shanks 1996 ; franca , andreani & cristiani , 1997 ) . however , so far no detailed model is available for the bias of quasars , though their high clustering strength and environment imply that quasars are hosted by massive halos ( see below ) .",
    "because of the lack of such a model , one can not confront the data of quasars with theoretical models in the way as for clusters .",
    "for instance , the abundance of quasars can only be used as an upper or lower limit to certain massive halos ; no detailed comparison between the number densities of quasars and of halos is allowed .",
    "obviously , it is very important to understand what kind of mass halos are associated with the majority of quasars",
    ". such a knowledge will not only enable the observational data of quasars to be powerful tests for theoretical models of galaxy formation but also tell that what type of local environments is responsible for intriguing the nuclear activities of quasars .",
    "like clusters and groups of galaxies , it is generally believed that quasars should be associated with certain type of collapsed dark matter halos . yet , different from identification of clusters , the environment suitable for forming quasars is not merely determined by gravitational parameters , as the hydro processes are also involved .",
    "therefore , the identification of quasar - harboring halos should be given by both gravitational and hydro parameters .",
    "in other words , not all halos with certain @xmath4 and/or velocity dispersion @xmath3 harbor quasars , because certain hydro conditions must be satisfied .",
    "however , considering the hydro processes are local , it is reasonable to assume that the hydro conditions may not be modulated by the density inhomogeneities on scales much larger than the size of the halo @xmath6 . in this case",
    ", the probability for a halo to have a quasar should be the same for all halos of the same kind , without depending on structures larger than @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the relative fractions of quasars with respect to the certain collapsed halos should be the same for all volumes larger than @xmath7 .",
    "consequently , when averaged on scale larger than @xmath6 , the distribution of quasars @xmath8 at redshift @xmath9 should be proportional to that of the considered halos , @xmath10 .",
    "thus , all effects of the hydro processes can be absorbed into a  normalization factor \" @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath12 , and @xmath11 is less dependent on @xmath9 than @xmath10 .",
    "the bias of quasar distribution with respect to the mass distribution is then dominated by the bias of the selected halos with respect to the mass .",
    "based on this analysis , quasar bias , at least on large scales , may also be only gravitational , depending on the gravitational parameters used for selecting the quasar - suitable halos .    accordingly , a possible model for quasar bias should at least satisfy the three conditions .",
    "1 . gravitational environment given by the identified halos is consistent with the observed environment around quasars ; 2 .",
    "the abundance of quasars , @xmath13 , at redshift @xmath9 is proportional to the number density of the identified halos , @xmath14 in a redshift - independent way , i.e. @xmath15 where @xmath11 is a _ z - independent _ constant , 3 .",
    "the amplitude and @xmath9-evolution of the halo - halo correlation function are consistent with the observed correlation function of quasars . in this letter",
    ", we will show within the framework of the cdm cosmogonic theories that such a bias model can indeed be settled following the above - mentioned points .",
    "the details of the points 1 , 2 and 3 will be discussed in the  2 , 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "a bias model of quasars is just a phenomenological relationship between the cosmic density field and quasars . with this relationship quasars",
    "can be identified from the mass density field . in this sense , bias , in fact , is a model for the environment suitable for the quasar formation .",
    "in what environment are quasars most likely to be formed ?",
    "many observations indicate that quasars are preferentially located in groups of galaxies .",
    "the evidences include the quasar - galaxy covariance function ( yee & green 1987 ) , the galaxy environments around quasars ( ellingson , et al .",
    "1991 ) , clustering of quasars ( bahcall & chokshi 1991 ; mo & fang 1993 ; komberg , kravtsov & lukash 1994 ; croom & shanks 1996 ; franca , andreani & cristiani , 1997 ) , and the civ - associated absorption in high redshift radio - loud quasars ( foltz et al 1988 ) .",
    "recently , an observation of a companion to quasar br1202 - 0725 with high redshift @xmath16 directly shows that the width of their ly@xmath17 emission lines is around 400 km s@xmath18 ( petitjean et al . 1996 . ) .",
    "these observations seemingly point to quasars being identified with the newly collapsed halos with 1-d velocity dispersion like groups , i.e. @xmath19 .",
    "it should be pointed out that this environment condition may not be necessary for low redshift quasars ( smith , boyle & maddox , 1995 ) , because galaxies and clusters underwent a significant evolution at @xmath20 .",
    "but , it is reasonable to assume that the environment with @xmath21 is favored by the formation of quasars at higher redshifts : a ) enough collapsed objects to form the engine of a quasar ; b ) dispersed gas to feed the engine through accretion ; and c ) not _ too _ many proto - galaxies to possibly disrupt the process of quasar formation .",
    "in the next two sections , we shall compare , within the framework of cdm cosmogonic models , the theoretical predictions for such halos with the observed quasar abundance and correlation functions .",
    "for a gaussian initial perturbation , the comoving number density of halos with 1-d velocity dispersion @xmath22 can be calculated with the press & schechter formalism ( 1974 ) as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the lagrangian radius of the dark halo being considered and @xmath25 almost independent of cosmologies .",
    "@xmath26 is the @xmath27 of the linear density fluctuations at redshift @xmath9 within a top - hat window of radius @xmath24 , and is determined by the initial density spectrum @xmath28 and normalization factor @xmath29 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath22 and @xmath24 is given by ( narayan & white 1988 ) @xmath30 for a universe with the density parameter @xmath31 .",
    "the n - body simulation results ( jing & fang 1994 ) showed @xmath32 which is used for all calculations in this work .",
    "two representative cdm models , i.e. the standard cdm ( scdm ) and flat low - density cdm ( lcdm ) models are employed .",
    "the hubble constant @xmath33 mpc@xmath18 , mass density @xmath31 , cosmological constant @xmath34 and @xmath35 are taken to be @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the scdm and lcdm , respectively .",
    "the models with these parameters seem to provide a good approximation to many observational properties of the universe , especially the abundance of clusters ( which is much related to the topic of this work ) .",
    "the total number density of the collapsed halos with the velocity dispersion greater than a certain value , say @xmath38 , is @xmath39 the birth rate of halos with @xmath40 is @xmath41 .",
    "this birth rate is shown in fig.1 for @xmath42 200 , 400 , and 800 @xmath43 . for each @xmath44 ,",
    "the birth rate in the two models possesses similar shape . at @xmath45 ,",
    "the birth rate keeps steady from @xmath46 to about 2 , and then rapidly drops to zero at @xmath47 for scdm and 0.7 for lcdm .",
    "the peak birth rate however shifts to higher redshift for smaller @xmath44 , and to lower redshift for larger @xmath44 .",
    "as has been discussed in  1 and 2 , each newly collapsed halo with @xmath48 may host @xmath2 quasars in average , and the harboring coefficient @xmath2 is @xmath9-independent . if the mean lifetime of quasars is @xmath49 , which is also @xmath9-independent , the comoving number density of quasars at the epoch of redshift @xmath9 is given by @xmath50 an accurate quasar lifetime @xmath49 is not important only if it is @xmath9-independent and is much less than the age of the universe for redshift @xmath51 . considering that birth rate of the halos is slowly varying with redshift when @xmath52 , we have approximately @xmath53 ( dz / dt)$ ] . since the shape of the birth rate is a strong function of the velocity dispersion ( especially as a function of @xmath9 ) , the abundance of quasars provides a strong test to the bias model proposed here .",
    "fig.2 plots @xmath54 for the scdm and lcdm models .",
    "the  normalization constant \" @xmath55 are adjusted in order that the theoretical maximum number densities of quasar abundance can fit with the observed one .",
    "the data points are the number density of quasars complete to absolute magnitude @xmath56 ( pei , 1995 , hewett , foltz & chaffee 1993 , schmidt , schneider & gunn 1992 ) . in these observations ,",
    "the density @xmath54 is measured in the einstein - de sitter cosmology ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "these data have been corrected to the case of non - zero @xmath34 in the panel of lcdm .",
    "the figure shows the redshift evolution of quasar abundances is fairly well described by the newly collapsed halos with @xmath45 .",
    "both the scdm and lcdm models are in reasonably good agreement with the observed abundance @xmath13 if the _ constant _ ( @xmath9-independent ) parameter @xmath55 is taken to be @xmath60 yr for the scdm model and @xmath61 yr for the lcdm model , though the best fitting value of @xmath22 is slightly lower ( about @xmath62 ) for the scdm model .",
    "however for @xmath63 , and 800 @xmath43 , the predictions can not fit with observed redshift evolution regardless of how to adjust the ",
    "normalization constant \" @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the consistency between theoretical and observed redshift evolution of quasar abundance can be achieved only for @xmath64 halos , which is not trivial .",
    "this result strongly supports that the majority of quasars be associated with new born halos with 1-d @xmath65 .",
    "particularly , for an environment with a given mass or velocity dispersion , the luminosities and lifetimes of quasars are still dispersed . however ,",
    "if the distributions of the luminosities and of the lifetimes for this type of halos are not modulated by large scale perturbations , all conclusion here should hold .",
    "according to the analysis of  1 , the bias model for @xmath66 km s@xmath18 halos is available on the scales larger than their typical size which is about @xmath67 @xmath68 mpc .",
    "therefore , on scales larger than 5 @xmath69 mpc the bias of quasar distribution is due mainly to the bias of @xmath70 halos . on such large scales and at high redshifts , the mass distribution is still linear .",
    "therefore , the two - point correlation function of the halos at redshift @xmath9 is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is physical radius , @xmath73 is the linear mass correlation function , and the bias factor @xmath74 is given by ( mo & white 1996 ) @xmath75.\\ ] ]    fig.3a shows the correlation functions for @xmath76 , 400 and 800 @xmath43 halos at @xmath77 .",
    "it shows that for @xmath78 the correlation length @xmath79 defined by @xmath80 is @xmath81 h@xmath18 mpc for the scdm , and @xmath82 h@xmath18 mpc for the lcdm .",
    "observationally , the two - point correlation function of quasars is found to obey the same power law . with @xmath83 taken to be 0.5 , the correlation length @xmath79 at @xmath84",
    "is found to be @xmath85 mpc ( mo & fang 1993 ) , @xmath86 mpc ( komberg , kravtsov & lukash 1994 ) , and @xmath87 mpc ( franca , andreani & cristiani 1997 ) .",
    "actually , these results do not sensitively depend on @xmath83 , because on the length scales of about @xmath88 mpc , the influence of the parameter @xmath89 is small",
    ". we should be careful in comparing the observed data with fig.3a .",
    "generally , the samples of quasars employed for the correlation statistics possess different limit magnitude for different redshifts .",
    "the samples employed for the correlation statistics contain quasars with @xmath90 .",
    "namely , they are not complete in the sense as the data used in fig.2",
    ". the larger @xmath91 may lead to a lower amplitude of the correlations . considering this uncertainty , both scdm and lcdm with @xmath45 halos are acceptable , though a smaller or larger value of @xmath44 may also be tolerated by the clustering observation alone .",
    "the redshift evolution of the halo - halo correlations for scdm and lcdm is plotted in fig.3b .",
    "it is interesting to see that the amplitudes of the correlation functions do not significantly evolve with redshift , having only a slight increase with redshift .",
    "this is because the clustering in the mass distribution of dark matter @xmath73 always increases with time , or decreases with redshift , but the bias factor @xmath92 increases with redshift .",
    "the two effects seem to be balanced by each other , giving a very slowly varying of @xmath93 with @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath9-evolution of quasar clustering has been studied for more than one decade ( e.g. chu & fang 1987 , shaver 1988 ) and the results are quite scatter . some showed a weak decrease of the correlation amplitudes around redshift 1.5 on scales of @xmath94mpc ( mo & fang 1993 ; komberg , kravtsov & lukash 1994 ; croom & shanks 1996 . ) some concluded no significant @xmath9-dependence from @xmath95 ( zitelli et al .",
    "1992 . ) and some even show very weak increase with redshift . recently , a weak @xmath9-increasing correlation from @xmath96 to @xmath97 is reported ( franca , andreani & cristiani , 1997 . ) obviously , these diverse data can not provide a concrete test on the prediction of fig.3b .",
    "although there is quite a bit uncertainty in the observed redshift evolution , the current result  no significant evolution of either @xmath9-increase and @xmath9-decrease  is consistent with the developed bias models .",
    "we showed that velocity - dispersion - selected halos are a possible mechanism for the bias of quasars .",
    "the majority of quasars at redshift @xmath0 formed in the environment of new born collapsed halos with 1-d velocity dispersion @xmath98 .",
    "both the harboring coefficient @xmath2 per halo and the lifetime of quasars are @xmath9-independent . with this bias model , the popular structure formation models , like scdm and lcdm ,",
    "can be fairly well reconciled with data of the abundance and correlations of quasars at @xmath99 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the velocity dispersion identified halos generally do nt have the same mass .",
    "eq.(2 ) shows that for a given @xmath70 , the redshifts the higher , the mass of the halos the smaller . this result has already been recognized in an earlier study , which shows that in order to fit with quasar abundance at high redshift , the mass of the halos has to be smaller than at the lower redshift ( bi & fang 1997 ) .    with this model",
    ", one can predict that 1 .",
    "the environment for quasars at redshifts from @xmath100 to 5 should be characterized by a velocity dispersion , @xmath98 ; 2 .",
    "the amplitudes of quasar two - point correlation function at high redshifts do nt significantly evolve with redshifts . in the paper ,",
    "only the models of the scdm and lcdm are considered .",
    "we can expected that with better data of quasars becoming available , the bias model of quasars will play more important role for discriminating among models of structure formations ."
