    "<S> axisymmetric incompressible flow is assumed in the present study of the free - surface fluid dynamic problem . </S>",
    "<S> the computed values of maximum spread factor , for the range of parameters of practical interest to aerosol jet@xmath0 printing , were found in very good agreement with some of the correlation formulas proposed by previous authors in the literature . combining formulas selected from different authors with appropriate modifications yields a maximum spread factor formula that can be used for first - order evaluations of deposited in droplet size during the aerosol jet@xmath0 technology development . </S>",
    "<S> the computational results also illustrate droplet impact dynamics with lamella shape evolution throughout the spreading , receding - relaxation , and wetting equilibrium phases , consistent with that observed and described by many previous authors . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a scale - invariant nature of the basic droplet impact behavior such that experiments with larger droplets at the same nondimensional parameter values may be considered for studying microdroplet impact dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> significant free surface oscillations can be observed when the droplet viscosity is relatively low . </S>",
    "<S> the border line between periodic free surface oscillations and aperiodic creeping to capillary equilibrium free surface shape appears at the value of ohnesorge number around @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> droplet bouncing after receding is prompted with large contact angles at solid surface ( as consistent with findings reported in the literature ) , but can be suppressed by increasing the droplet viscosity .    _ </S>",
