    "during the brief history of extrasolar planet investigations , our understanding of the relative populations of different types of planets has been limited by the observational biases of the techniques employed . with the advent of sophisticated transit searches and hypersensitive radial velocity measurements ,",
    "significant progress has been made discovering various types of planets that orbit stars with periods up to a few years .",
    "less progress has been made in discovering planets in longer orbits , and particularly around nearby m dwarfs , which account for at least 74% of the stellar population within 10 pc @xcite .",
    "m dwarfs offer fertile ground for companion searches , as @xcite have inferred that a high fraction of m dwarfs host terrestrial planets at short orbital periods .",
    "less is known about the populations of jupiter - mass planets and brown dwarfs around m dwarfs , particularly at orbital periods longer than a few years .    to understand how m dwarf planetary systems form and evolve , we must probe the full regime of companion masses and orbital periods .",
    "transit techniques are geometrically biased towards companions with small orbits , while radial velocity techniques are biased towards massive companions with short periods that exert large gravitational accelerations on their host stars .",
    "direct imaging techniques are limited to young , giant planets at large separations .",
    "astrometric techniques , which measure the positions of stars on the plane of the sky , are most sensitive to jovian - type planets in jovian - type orbits . while radial velocity observing programs are now becoming sensitive to such companions @xcite , the astrometric results presented here have longer observational baselines , of up to 13 years .",
    "furthermore , astrometry can detect companions with a large range of inclinations and orientations , and allow for the determination of orbit inclinations and accurate companion masses .    to date the majority of nearby extrasolar planets around m dwarfs",
    "have been discovered by radial velocity searches , which tend to select the brightest m dwarfs . as discussed in more detail in @xmath2[sec : analysis ] , in ground - based imaging programs the brightest targets generally have the noisiest astrometric residuals due to the short exposures required and the lack of comparably bright reference stars . with the exception of gj 1214 ,",
    "five m dwarfs in our sample were found to have planets using radial velocity techniques , and are among the brightest targets in our astrometric program .",
    "an extreme case is the k dwarf bd @xmath010 3166 , for which we are not sensitive to sub - stellar companions , but for which we provide the first accurate parallax . for comparison ,",
    "we have included six additional m dwarfs that are less bright , less massive , and closer , and therefore more favorable to companion detection via astrometry . to calibrate our analysis ,",
    "we have also included three confirmed stellar binaries with clear photocentric perturbations for which we have characterized the orbits .",
    "these binaries were chosen from the roughly two dozen binaries in our observing program with clear astrometric perturbations because we have observed multiple orbital periods , and can most accurately characterize the orbits .",
    "astrometric solutions for proper motion and parallax are given for each of the 16 systems targeted , plus orbital solutions for three binaries .",
    "a detailed analysis of the astrometric residuals is given to search for companions to the 12 m dwarf systems without close stellar companions .",
    "periodograms of the astrometric residuals have been generated , along with detection limits based on simulations of 10 million hypothetical companions to each star .",
    "these are the first results of a larger recons survey for companions orbiting more than 250 red dwarfs within 25 pc for which we have at least five years of coverage . as observations continue",
    ", this sample will grow , further constraining the population of brown dwarf and super - jupiter companions in long period orbits around m dwarfs . finally , to provide context for these results we provide a comprehensive list of the 17 m dwarfs within 25 pc having exoplanets as of 1 july 2014 , including the six targeted in this work .",
    "the 0.9 m telescope at ctio is equipped with a 2048 @xmath3 2048 tektronix ccd camera with 0.401 pixel@xmath4 plate scale @xcite .",
    "only the center quarter of the chip is used for astrometric and photometric observations , yielding a 6.8 square field of view .",
    "astrometric exposures are taken through one of four filters , @xmath5 ( old ) , @xmath5 ( new ) , @xmath6 , or @xmath7 ( old ) , @xmath5 ( new ) , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 filters are 5438 , 5475 , 6425 , and 8075  , respectively . ] ( hereafter without subscripts , and the @xmath8 filters combined ) .",
    "depending on the brightnesses of the science targets , reference stars , and sky conditions , exposure times vary from 20 to 1200 s for targets with 9 @xmath9 .",
    "for optimal centroiding , exposure times are set so that either science or reference stars have maximum peak adu of @xmath1050,000 ( digital saturation occurs at 65,537 adu ) .",
    "observations are almost always made within @xmath11 30 minutes of a science target s transit to minimize the corrections required for differential color refraction , as described in @xcite .",
    "three to five frames are typically taken each night , depending primarily on the exposure time required . to enable routine calibration of the science images , bias and dome flat frames are taken nightly .",
    "instrument setups for most stars have been kept constant during the 13 years of observations .",
    "however , we have used two @xmath8 filters , dubbed the `` old '' tek#2 @xmath8 filter ( @xmath12 = 5438  , @xmath13 = 1026  ) and `` new '' tek#1 v filter ( @xmath12 = 5475  , @xmath13 = 1000  ) , because the `` old '' filter cracked in 2005 february .",
    "the `` new '' @xmath8 filter was used between 2005 and 2009 .",
    "the `` old '' @xmath8 filter was reinstated in 2009 july after confirming that the crack in the corner did not significantly affect astrometric residuals . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", a reliable parallax can be obtained using data from both filters as long as at least 1 - 2 years of data ( depending on observing frequency ) have been taken in each filter .",
    "reductions containing both `` old '' and `` new '' @xmath8 frames can exhibit offsets of a several milliarcseconds ( mas ) in residuals on both axes .",
    "this has been mitigated by choosing close - in reference stars , and only using frames taken near the meridian . in total ,",
    "7 of the 16 systems discussed in this paper were observed astrometrically in the @xmath8 filter .",
    "further details about the filters and their effects on the astrometry can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paths traced on the sky by science stars result from the combinations of proper motions and parallactic shifts .",
    "details of the data reduction process used to separate these motions are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "briefly , we ( 1 ) use sextractor @xcite to measure centroids , ( 2 ) define a six - constant plate model to find plate constants ( given in equation ( 4 ) of @xcite ) , ( 3 ) assume that ensembles of reference stars have zero mean parallax and proper motion , ( 4 ) solve least - square equations for multi - epoch images ( given in equation ( 5 ) of @xcite ) , and ( 5 ) convert from relative parallax to absolute parallax by estimating the distances of the reference stars photometrically .",
    "our typical centering precision is 2.1 - 3.5 mas , or 0.5 - 0.9% of a pixel , depending on the filter , with @xmath14 being the best and @xmath8 being the worst . to correct the relative parallax to an absolute parallax ,",
    "photometric distances are estimated by comparing @xmath15 colors to @xmath16 for single , main - sequence stars in the recons 10 pc sample @xcite .",
    "a distance is estimated for each reference star , and the correction to absolute parallax is then computed using the weighted mean distance of the entire reference field . the uncertainty on the correction is determined using equation ( 6 ) in @xcite .    in the case of a binary with a given combination of magnitude and mass differences , where @xmath17 is the photocentric semi - major axis of the orbit of the primary , @xmath18 is the fractional mass ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 is the relative luminosity ( @xmath21 ) , and @xmath22 is the semi - major axis of the relative orbit of the two components .",
    "the perturbation we detect here is @xmath17 . ]",
    ", we detect its photocenter orbit around its barycenter , in addition to the motions due to parallax and proper motion .",
    "hence , the residuals of our typical binary star s parallax reduction are significantly offset from zero . in order to get a better parallax result and calculate the photocenter s orbital elements",
    ", we first carry out a standard reduction for proper motion and parallax .",
    "we then fit a photocentric orbit to the residuals , i.e , we treat these residuals as a binary orbit , using the techniques described in @xcite .",
    "based on the orbital elements we calculate , this photocentric orbit in components of r.a . and decl .",
    "is then removed from the centroids of the science star at each epoch .",
    "finally , we re - calculate proper motion and parallax using these corrected centroids .",
    "the final `` cleaned '' proper motions and parallaxes are the values given for the binaries in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "after one iteration , the parallax errors are reduced to those typical of similar program stars , and the residuals are significantly reduced and consistent with the mean errors found for our overall program .",

    "are taken nightly for basic image calibration .",
    "all science stars were observed at airmass @xmath23 .",
    "exposure times were chosen to reach a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) @xmath24 100 for science stars in each of the @xmath15 filters .",
    "combinations of fields that provided 10 or more standard stars from @xcite and/or e - regions from @xcite were observed several times each night to derive transformation equations and extinction curves .",
    "further details of photometric data reductions , the definition of transformation equations , errors , etc .",
    ", can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations used to the provide spectral types in table 2 were made at the ctio 1.5 m using the r - c spectrograph and loral 1200 @xmath3 800 ccd camera between 2003 and 2006 .",
    "grating # 32 was used in first order with a tilt of 15.@xmath251 , and observations were made using a 2 slit .",
    "the order - blocking filter og570 was utilized to provide spectra covering the range of 6000 - 9000  with a resolution of 8.6  . for calibration , bias frames , dome flats , and sky flats",
    "were taken at the beginning of each night .",
    "further details regarding the 1.5 m spectroscopy program and associated data reduction , including assignment of spectral types , can be found in @xcite .",
    "astrometric residuals represent the deviation in a target s measured position from the solution for proper motion and parallax , given for all 16 target stars in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the residuals for each star are plotted in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "each filled circle represents the mean of typically three to five frames taken in a single night , with a corresponding estimate of the nightly mean error .",
    "open circles represent nights with only one frame , which are included in the parallax measurement but are not included in the following analysis of the residuals .",
    "the three binaries ( gj 748ab , lhs 1582ab , and lhs 3738ab ) exhibit large , periodic perturbations in both r.a . and decl .",
    ", indicating the presence of a companion in each case .",
    "because the systems are unresolved in our images , we calculate a photocentric semi - major axis , as previously discussed .",
    "the remaining targets generally have flat residuals , although some are more scattered ( gj 849 ) than others ( gj 1128 ) .",
    "targets with the flattest residuals , such as denis j1048 - 3956 , generally have at least 8 reference stars that closely and evenly surround the target , and are bright enough to have a least 1,000 peak counts when the target has 50,000 .",
    "fainter targets tend to have the flattest residuals because they have a larger number of suitable reference stars and require longer exposures , which smooth out short - term seeing effects that produce psfs with poorly - defined centroids .",
    "the residuals were analyzed for the presence of companions using lomb - scargle periodograms , shown in figure [ fig2 ] , generated by the method given in @xcite .",
    "this method weights each data point by its estimated nightly mean error , and produces a normalized periodogram for the data sequence with power ranging from 0 to 1 .",
    "we only attempt to detect companions with periods greater than two years but less than the length of the observations , and have only generated periodograms for those ranges .",
    "the data were oversampled in increments of one day to create smooth periodograms .",
    "as @xcite have shown , oversampling the periodogram does not significantly increase the risk of false periodogram peaks .    as the data are irregularly spaced , it was not possible to use an analytical formula for the false alarm probabilities ( fap ) . instead , empirical fap distribution functions were calculated as outlined in @xcite by generating periodograms for 10,000 sets of random noise .",
    "each of the 10,000 data sets has the same number of observations as the actual data , with the same observation times and errors as the actual data .",
    "the randomized values of each point within a given data set are assigned from a normal distribution with a standard deviation representing the distribution of offsets from zero of the actual data points .",
    "each of these 10,000 periodograms was then sampled in a grid of periods with five day increments between two years and the length of observations to find the highest power occurring in each periodogram .",
    "the fap for an observed periodogram peak of a given power is equal to the fraction of the 10,000 data sets with peaks greater than or equal to that power .",
    "the normalized powers corresponding to fap values of 0.1 , 0.01 , and 0.001 are shown as dashed lines in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "this corresponds to 10% , 1% , and 0.1% probabilities that the peak is due solely to random noise and the cadence of observations . as a calibration , periodograms and fap functions",
    "were also generated for the three confirmed stellar binaries for which astrometric perturbations are clearly evident .",
    "these binaries have significant periodogram peaks ( fap @xmath26 0.001 ) in both the r.a . and decl .",
    "axes at periods corresponding to their orbital periods , while the remaining 13 targets have no significant peaks .",
    "this indicates that our periodograms are sensitive to astrometric perturbations , and that we have not detected any significant periodicity in the residuals of the remaining 12 m dwarfs and one k dwarf without companions .",
    "given that there are no companions evident in the residuals of the non - binary targets , we aim to establish lower limits for the companion masses and periods to which we are sensitive , and would have detected were they present .",
    "for each target we ran a simulation of 10 million hypothetical companions orbiting each star with masses chosen randomly from a uniform distribution between 0.5 and 80 @xmath1 , and periods chosen randomly from a uniform distribution between 2 years up to the length of observations .",
    "although we have observed perturbations as short as 1.2 years , our practical lower limit is 2 years .",
    "all geometric parameters ( inclination , eccentricity , time of periastron , longitude of ascending node , and longitude of periastron ) were assigned randomly from a uniform distribution of all possible values , including eccentricity , which was allowed to be as high as 0.99 .",
    "the program then calculates the astrometric perturbation that each simulated companion would induce on the primary , using a primary mass calculated from the mass - luminosity relations in @xcite ( equations 5a and 5b ) and the revised relation for the lowest mass stars in @xcite . for den j1048 - 3956 and lp 944 - 020 , which are too faint for the relations , we assume masses of 0.08 @xmath27 .",
    "we assume that the companion does not contribute significantly to the overall flux in each system , so that the photocenter of the system is concentric with the primary star .",
    "this assumption proves problematic when considering brown dwarf companions to the two latest m dwarfs , den j1048 - 3956 and lp 944 - 020 .",
    "however , the trigonometric parallaxes of these targets agree well with their photometric distance estimates ( columns 12 and 13 of table [ tab2 ] ) , and we conclude that neither have nearly equal luminosity companions .",
    "the goodness - of - fit between the observed data @xmath28 with errors @xmath29 , and a flat line with @xmath30 was determined using the reduced chi squared statistic @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of degrees of freedom , given by @xmath33 for @xmath34 data points and @xmath35 fitted parameters . because we did not attempt to fit a model to the data , but only to analyze how well a simulation fits the data , we set @xmath35 equal to zero .",
    "as data points with small error bars are more heavily weighted , we discarded epochs that have unrealistic errors smaller than 1 mas  representing less than 5% of the epochs  because such points overconstrain the orbits that can be fit .",
    "simulated orbits for which @xmath36 was greater than 4 in at least one of either r. a. or decl .",
    "we consider to be orbits that we would have detected .",
    "this threshold of 4 is based empirically on the values plotted in figure [ fig3 ] , where the lower panel is an inset of the upper .",
    "the plotted @xmath36 values were calculated for ( 1 ) the stars included in this paper , ( 2 ) calibration stars with flat residuals we use to monitor potential fluctuations in equipment and our data reduction pipeline , and ( 3 ) additional known binaries with perturbations .",
    "we compare these targets residuals to the case of flat residuals , i.e. , an exact astrometric solution with no perturbation .",
    "as expected , the binaries with perturbations have large @xmath36 values , indicating that a flat line is a poor fit to the data .",
    "the two solid points inside the @xmath37 box are long term perturbations with large gaps in the astrometric observations .",
    "as more data are collected , those two points will move to larger @xmath36 values outside the box , but we include the points here for completeness . for those stars with no perturbations , all have @xmath36 less than 4 in both axes , and are centered around 1 .",
    "this indicates that we are accurately calculating our measurement errors , and provides an empirical @xmath36 value of 4 , above which we are sensitive to perturbations .",
    "table [ tab1 ] gives the parallax and proper motion results for the 16 systems , with details about the astrometric observations ( filters used , number of seasons observed , number of frames used in reductions , time coverage , span of time , and the number of reference stars ) and results ( relative parallaxes , parallax corrections , absolute parallaxes , proper motions , position angles of the proper motions , and the derived tangential velocities based on relative proper motions and parallaxes ) .",
    "all but two of the sixteen systems have parallax errors of @xmath102 mas or less .",
    "bd @xmath010 3166 and gj 876 have larger errors due to combinations of faint reference stars and short exposures .",
    "corrections to absolute parallax are generally less than @xmath102 mas , so systematics in the corrections should not significantly affect the results . three targets ( gj 317 , gj 667c , and bd @xmath010 3166 , ) have corrections of @xmath103@xmath38-@xmath384 mas due to reddening of the reference stars , which skews their photometric distance estimates . in these cases ,",
    "we adopt a generic correction of 1.50 @xmath11 0.50 mas .",

    "<S> astrometric measurements are presented for seven nearby stars with previously detected planets : six m dwarfs ( gj 317 , gj 667c , gj 581 , gj 849 , gj 876 , and gj 1214 ) and one k dwarf ( bd @xmath010 3166 ) . </S>",
    "<S> measurements are also presented for six additional nearby m dwarfs without known planets , but which are more favorable to astrometric detections of low mass companions , as well as three binary systems for which we provide astrometric orbit solutions . </S>",
    "<S> observations have baselines of three to thirteen years , and were made as part of the recons long - term astrometry and photometry program at the ctio / smarts 0.9 m telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we provide trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions for all 16 systems , and perform an extensive analysis of the astrometric residuals to determine the minimum detectable companion mass for the 12 m dwarfs not having close stellar secondaries . for the six m dwarfs with known planets , we are not sensitive to planets , but can rule out the presence of all but the least massive brown dwarfs at periods of 2  12 years . </S>",
    "<S> for the six more astrometrically favorable m dwarfs , we conclude that none have brown dwarf companions , and are sensitive to companions with masses as low as 1 @xmath1 for periods longer than two years . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we conclude that proxima centauri has no jovian companions at orbital periods of 2  12 years . </S>",
    "<S> these results complement previously published m dwarf planet occurrence rates by providing astrometrically determined upper mass limits on potential super - jupiter companions at orbits of two years and longer . as part of a continuing survey , </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with the paucity of super - jupiter and brown dwarf companions we find among the over 250 red dwarfs within 25 pc observed longer than five years in our astrometric program . </S>"
