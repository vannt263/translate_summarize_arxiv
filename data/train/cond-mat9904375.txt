    "therefore , we shall discuss only the results of @xmath19 and @xmath66 for @xmath62 .",
    "these two phases of @xmath6 can cause important differences .",
    "it is known that for any @xmath17 , time reversal symmetry is locally broken @xcite at lower temperatures with the onset of the secondary component which correspond to a phase transition to an fully gapped phase for @xmath67 , from a partially ungapped phase of @xmath12 symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath68 phase still remains nodeful , although the nodal lines shifts a lot from the usual @xmath69 lines of the @xmath12 . in fig .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) we present the temperature dependencies of the order parameters in the complex mixed symmetry .",
    "curves corresponding to the @xmath3-wave channels are represented with thinner joining lines of different styles whereas the minor @xmath9 component is denoted through that of same style but with thicker lines ( same strategy will be carried out in other figures as well ) .",
    "for a zero zeeman field ( @xmath67 ) , the amplitude of the @xmath3-wave is suppressed with the onset of the minor @xmath9 component at @xmath70 k which leads to a kink like structure ( cf .",
    "the thin solid curve in fig1 ( a ) ) .",
    "= 4.5truein = 4.5truein    with application of weak zeeman field the transition temperature of the minor @xmath9 state decreases while the zero temperature magnitude remains the same .",
    "this causes a shift in the kink like structure in the thermal dependence of the @xmath3 wave channel towards lower temperature with increasing field and hence a small enhancement in the @xmath3-wave with field at lower temperature occurs .",
    "this point will be clearer from fig .",
    "5(b ) as discussed latter . at a field value",
    "@xmath71 ev , the @xmath9 wave component is completely suppressed leading to a pure @xmath3 wave phase .",
    "thus we have a magnetic field induced transition at lower temperature from _ fully gapped phase _ of the @xmath72 state to a _ partially _ gapped phase of the @xmath3-wave .",
    "therefore , in absence or very low magnetic field , there is a transition from a _ partially gapped _",
    "phase of the @xmath3-wave at higher temperature to a _ fully gapped _",
    "@xmath72 phase at lower temperatures . with increasing field the fully gapped phase region with respect to temperature decreases and brings back the ungapped phase of the @xmath3-wave .",
    "these phase transitions will have important bearings in the thermodynamic and transport properties .",
    "= 3.25truein = 3.25truein    in fig .",
    "1(b ) we present the paramagnetic state of the @xmath3-wave .",
    "this phase has also been qualitatively investigated recently by yang and sondhi @xcite with possibility of pairing with finite momentum .",
    "we therefore restrict to present only the details thermal dependence of the @xmath3-wave superconductivity in presence of zeeman magnetic field that were not discussed .",
    "we show that with increasing field ( at lower fields ) the zero temperature magnitude of the @xmath3-wave remains unchanged whereas the @xmath7 is reduced . at higher field _ e.g _ , @xmath73 one sees a first order transition from superconducting state to the normal state with respect to temperature .",
    "this behaviour causes a magnetic field induced enhancement of the @xmath74 ratio .",
    "this ratio is crucial for many physical properties like specific heat jump etc . and",
    "hence expected to have drastic effect with magnetic field .",
    "= 3.25truein = 3.25truein    in fig.2 we describe the thermal behaviour of superconductors with @xmath75 symmetry in presence of magnetic field .",
    "first of all , in absence of magnetic field , the thermal behaviors at lower temperatures is quite different ( as we have seen in fig .",
    "1 ) , the @xmath9-wave gap opens very fast below @xmath70 k and also induces a growth to the @xmath3 at a faster rate than that above @xmath70 k. while the @xmath9-wave has about three times the zero temperature value compared to @xmath72 phase , the @xmath3 wave also have quite larger value .",
    "with application of a very small magnetic field the @xmath9-component is suppressed largely ; both its @xmath7 and the zero temperature gap being suppressed .",
    "the @xmath3-wave gap magnitude is also suppressed while its @xmath7 remained practically unchanged with such small values of the magnetic field .",
    "more importantly , although both the @xmath3 and the @xmath9 channel has larger magnitude in the @xmath75 phase the critical field ( @xmath76 ev ) at which the @xmath9 component vanishes completely is _ smaller _ compared to that for the @xmath59 phase ( @xmath77 ev ) of the mixed symmetry .",
    "distinctly , the response of the zeeman field to the @xmath75 superconductors is more pronounced than the @xmath72 superconductors .",
    "this study therefore also revealed the importance of the phase of the minor component in @xmath3-wave superconductors with a pratical example of effect of zeeman magnetic field , for the first time . in order to establish the importance of the phase of the minor component we also study the effect of zeeman magnetic field in @xmath78 and @xmath79 symmetry superconductors respectively",
    "the qualitative as well as quantitative behaviors remain almost same as that shown in figures 1 and 2 . thus establishing that the response of the superconducors with mixed order parameter symmetries with @xmath68 phase of the minor component is stronger .",
    "= 3.25truein = 3.25truein    in figures 5 and 6 we concentrate on studying behavior of such mixed order parameter symmetry superconductors in presence of magnetic field as a function of band filling ( @xmath80 ) for @xmath10 and @xmath9 as minor components respectively .",
    "with application of a small field the minor component @xmath16 or @xmath9 is suppressed only at lower fillings and then with increasing field it is suppressed in the optimal doping regime suddenly .",
    "therefore , with increasing field one finds mixed symmetry region as well as pure @xmath3-wave region with respect to filling  a _ non - uniform _ superconductivity .",
    "this behavior depends on the nature of the minor component . for @xmath81 ,",
    "the mixed symmetry is possible around half - filling and at around @xmath82 in an intermediate field value . with increasing field mixed symmetry regions around both the band fillings shrinks and at a field value of @xmath83 the @xmath9-wave vanishes leading to a pure @xmath3-wave phase .",
    "it may be noticed the @xmath3-wave channel is enhanced ( cf .",
    "fig 5(b ) ) in the optimal doping region with intermediate field values as was also mentioned earlier while discussing fig1 ( a ) .",
    "this however does not occur in case of @xmath10 .",
    "for @xmath10 minor component , the minor component is suppressed strongly only from the lower filling with increasing field and at an intermidiate field the mixing is possible only near half filling .",
    "the @xmath3-wave boundary towards lower fillings as well as around half - filling also shrinks with increasing field values in contrast to @xmath84 .",
    "one always see a sharp transition from a mixed phase to a pure @xmath3-wave phase or otherway around with respect to band filling irrespective of the minor component in a given magnetic field . at larger fields ( @xmath85 ) when the minor component is suppressed completely _",
    "i.e _ , one has a pure @xmath3-wave phase , the @xmath3-wave phase also show sharp transition from @xmath3-wave superconducting state to a normal state ( cf . fig .",
    "= 4.5truein = 4.5truein    in fig .",
    "6 we study the same as that in fig . 5 for @xmath75 and @xmath86 symmetries .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath66 phase of the minor component ( as in fig .",
    "5 ) , the minor components have very large values in the @xmath19 phase although have the same @xmath87 as mentioned earlier , in absence of the magnetic field . with very small magnetic field such large amplitudes of the condensation in the minor channel is strongly suppressed ( see fig 6(b ) specially ) . the nature of suppression , as in fig.5 , is different for different minor component .",
    "for example , @xmath10 is suppressed only from the lower filling whereas the @xmath9-wave is suppressed both from the lower filling as well as around the optimal doping .",
    "= 4.5truein = 4.5truein    overall , it is very distinct that the magentic field affects the @xmath19 mixed phase more stongly than the @xmath66 phase .",
    "this is due to the fact that the response of applied zeeman field is paramagnetic with destruction of superconductivity over parts of the fermi surface where the zeeman field exceeds the local magnitude of the @xmath88-dependent gap resulting a spin polarization in the normal electrons . for @xmath59 phase",
    ", the nodes are missing and the fermi surface is gapped all over , although the gap will have local minima .",
    "thus response of the @xmath66 phase is weaker compared to the @xmath89 phase .",
    "noticiably , the critical value at which the minor component vanishes completely in all band fillings for the @xmath19 phase is @xmath90 ev whereas that for @xmath66 is @xmath91 ev .",
    "( the value of @xmath92 depends on @xmath80 , as well as @xmath4 and @xmath6 ) .    above @xmath93 ,",
    "the paramegnetic state of the @xmath3-wave superconductors are also presented .",
    "the region of @xmath3-wave superconductivity shrinks with increasing field around the band filling @xmath94 .",
    "the change from @xmath3-wave to spin polarized normal state is very sharp with respect to the band filling . in the @xmath75 state",
    "a plateau has been observed in the @xmath3 channel in weak or zero field , similar to the behaviour known for the ybco systems @xcite .",
    "it may be mentioned that krishana _",
    "et al . _ , found the longitudinal thermal conductivity of @xmath95 at lower temperatures ( 5k to 20 k ) decreases with the increase in magnetic field applied along @xmath96-axis . above a critical value of the magnetic field @xmath97 , the thermal conductivity cease to change with the magnetic field and develops a plateau .",
    "it was proposed @xcite that the @xmath8 pairing state is unstable against the formation of @xmath98 ( where @xmath99 ) in presence of @xmath100 such that the loss of quasiparticle transport in the thermal conductivity can be explained . in contrast , we started with a @xmath98 picture and application of zeeman field ( which may be mapped as application of magnetic field parallel to the 2d @xmath2 plane ) without considering the orbital effect did not find any enhancement in the condensation of the minor channel but suppression leading to a pure paramegnetic @xmath3 state .",
    "in summary we have performed a detailed study on the effect of zeeman magnetic field on mixed pairing symmetry with predominant @xmath3-wave which seems to be very promising symmetry for the high @xmath7 systems .",
    "thus we have described the paramagnetic state in the mixed symmetry superconductors and subsequently in the @xmath3-wave superconductors .",
    "in particular we established that the phase of the minor component mixed with predominant @xmath3-wave is of immense importance . the @xmath19 phase minor component symmetry responds to zeeman field more profoundly than the @xmath66 of the minor component .",
    "it will be very interesting to calculte the specific heat , magnetization , density of states as a function of magnetic field using this model .",
    "we argued that the orbital effect is secondary when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the conducting plane .",
    "this may indicate that the experimental observation by krishana _",
    "et al . _ , involve strong coupling of spins to orbitals due to application of magnetic field perpendicular to the plane at lower temperatures .",
    "however , the order parameter alone does not completely determine the thermodynamic property of a system . in ref .",
    "@xcite , some estimations and scaling relations in the change of various physical properties due to zeeman field are given for a pure @xmath3-wave superconductor .",
    "it turns out , a weak zeeman field does little to the order parameter but may profoundly affect the thermodynamic property of a pure @xmath12 supercondcutor .",
    "such effects will presumably also remain for mixed superconductors with @xmath89 as the gapnodes similar to @xmath12 remains , its effect in the @xmath66 phase has to be studied more carefully .",
