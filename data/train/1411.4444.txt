    "recently the l - convexity is considered for functions on general graph structures other than  @xmath11 .",
    "observe that @xmath26 is naturally identified with the vertex set of a directed path ( of infinite length ) , and a function on @xmath11 is regarded as a function on the @xmath2-product of these paths .",
    "observe that operations @xmath27 and @xmath28 are definable in a graph - theoretical way .",
    "hence l@xmath9-convex functions are well - defined functions on the cartesian product of directed paths .",
    "based on this observation , kolmogorov  @xcite considered an analogue of l@xmath29-convex functions defined on the product of rooted trees , called _ tree - submodular functions_. hirai  @xcite considered an analogue of l@xmath29-convex functions on a more general structure , a _ modular complex _ , which is a structure obtained by gluing of modular lattices .",
    "his motivation comes from the tractability classification of minimum 0-extension problems and a combinatorial duality theory of multicommodity flows .    in this paper",
    ", we continue this line of research .",
    "we introduce the notion of _ l - extendability _ for functions on ( the vertex set of ) the @xmath2-fold cartesian product @xmath30 of trees @xmath31 .",
    "this notion is inspired by the idea of _ submodular relaxation _",
    "@xcite and related half - integral relaxations of np - hard problems , such as vertex cover and multiway cut .",
    "we first introduce a variation of a tree - submodular function , called an _ alternating l - convex function_. alternating l - convex functions are also defined by a variation of the discrete midpoint convexity inequality ( [ eqn : midpoint ] ) , and coincide with fujishige s _ uj - convex functions _",

    "l - convex relaxation _ of @xmath10 .",
    "the first half of our main contribution is to establish basic properties of alternating l - convex functions and l - extendable functions .",

    "this optimality criterion is an immediate consequence of the definition , and may not be precisely new ; it is expected from @xcite .",
    "we further prove the @xmath24-geodesic property for the steepest descent algorithm for alternating l - convex functions : the number of the iterations is equal to the @xmath24-distance from the initial point to minimizers .",
    "we establish the proximity theorem for l - extendable functions : regard @xmath31 as a bipartite graph with two color classes @xmath37 . for a minimizer @xmath20 over @xmath38 ,",
    "there is a global minimizer of @xmath10 within the @xmath24-ball around @xmath20 with radius @xmath2 .",
    "we prove the persistency property for l - convex relaxations : a minimizer of an l - extendable function is obtained by _ rounding _ any minimizer of its l - convex relaxation .",
    "this property is known for the cases of bisubmodular and @xmath0-submodular relaxations  @xcite .",
    "we introduce a useful special class of l - extendable functions , called _",
    "2-separable convex functions _ , as an analogue of a class of functions with form ( [ eqn : midpoint ] ) .",
    "we give explicit l - convex relaxations for which the steepest descent algorithm is implementable by a maximum flow algorithm .",
    "in fact , the local problem is a minimization of a special @xmath0-submodular function , which is a sum of ( binary ) _ basic @xmath0-submodular functions _ , introduced by iwata , wahlstrm , and yoshida  @xcite .",
    "they showed that this class of @xmath0-submodular functions can be minimized by maximum flow computation .",
    "therefore the l - convex relaxation of a @xmath39-separable convex function is efficiently minimized .",
    "for some cases , an optimal solution of this relaxation can easily be rounded to a @xmath39-approximate solution of the original 2-separable convex function .",
    "this approximation algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of the classical @xmath39-approximation algorithm for multiway cut  @xcite .",
    "these results are motivated by the design of a new simple polynomial scaling algorithm for _ minimum cost free multiflow problem _ , which is the second half of our main contribution . for an undirected ( integer-)capacitated network with terminal set @xmath40 , a _ multiflow _",
    "is a pair of a set of paths connecting terminals in @xmath40 and its flow - value function satisfying capacity constraints .",
    "a _ maximum free multiflow _ is a multiflow of a maximum total flow - value .",
    "suppose that each edge has a nonnegative cost . the minimum cost free multiflow problem asks to find a maximum free multiflow with the minimum total cost .",
    "karzanov  @xcite proved that there always exists a half - integral minimum cost maximum free multiflow , and presented a pseudo - polynomial time algorithm to find it .",
    "later he  @xcite gave a strongly polynomial time algorithm by using a generic polynomial time lp solver ( the ellipsoid method or the interior point method ) .",
    "currently no _ purely combinatorial _",
    "strongly polynomial time algorithm is known .",
    "goldberg and karzanov  @xcite presented two purely combinatorial weakly polynomial time algorithms : one of them is based on capacity scaling and the other one is based on cost scaling .",
    "however the description and analysis of their algorithms ( in each scaling phase ) are not easy ; they did not give an explicit polynomial running time .",
    "as an application of the theory of l - extendable functions , we present a new simple purely combinatorial polynomial time scaling algorithm . we hope that our algorithm will be a step toward the design of a purely combinatorial strongly polynomial time algorithm for minimum cost multiflow problem .",
    "we formulate a dual of our problem to the minimization of a 2-separable l - convex function on the product @xmath30 of a subdivided - star @xmath31 , where a _ subdivided star _ is a tree obtained from a star by successive edge - subdivisions",
    ". then we can apply a domain scaling technique .",
    "the scaled problem in each phase is again a minimization of a 2-separable l - convex function , and is solved by the steepest descent algorithm implemented by max - flow computations .",
    "the number of iterations is estimated by the proximity theorem the @xmath24-geodesic property , and the persistency property .",
    "in the last phase , we obtain an optimal dual solution , and from this we can construct a desired minimum cost free multiflow .",
    "our algorithm may be viewed as a multiflow version of a proximity scaling ( or domain scaling ) algorithm for the convex dual of minimum cost flow problem  @xcite , and is the first combinatorial algorithm to this problem having an explicit polynomial running time .",
    "the total time is @xmath41 , where @xmath2 is the number of nodes , @xmath3 is the number of edges , @xmath0 is the number of terminals , @xmath4 is the maximum of an edge - cost , @xmath5 is the total sum of edge - capacities , and @xmath6 is the time complexity of finding a maximum flow in a network of @xmath7 nodes and @xmath8 edges .",
    "our algorithm is designed to solve , in the same time complexity , a more general class of multiflow problems , _ minimum cost node - demand multiflow problems _ , and is the first combinatorial polynomial time algorithm for this class of the problems .",
    "this multiflow problem arises as an lp - relaxation of a class of network design problems , called _ terminal backup problems _",
