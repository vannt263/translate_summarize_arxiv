    "cp violation ( cpv ) plays a crucial role in our understanding of the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau )  @xcite .",
    "this is because the preponderance of matter over antimatter in the observed universe can not be generated from an equal amounts of matter and antimatter unless cp is broken as shown by sakharov ( 1967 ) , who pointed out that in addition to cp violation baryon - number violation , c ( charge - conjugation ) violation , and a departure from thermal equilibrium are all necessary to successfully achieve a net baryon asymmetry in early universe . in the standard model ( sm )",
    "cp symmetry is violated due to a complex phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite . however , since the extent of cp violation in the sm is not enough for achieving the observed bau , we need new source(s ) of cp violation for a successful bau . on the other hand ,",
    "cp violations in the lepton sector are imperative if the bau could be realized through leptogenesis .",
    "so , any hint or observation of the leptonic cp violation can strengthen our belief in leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "the violation of the cp symmetry is a crucial ingredient of any dynamical mechanism which intends to explain both low energy cp violation and the baryon asymmetry .",
    "renormalizable gauge theories are based on the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism , and it is natural to have the spontaneous cp violation ( scpv )  @xcite as an integral part of that mechanism . determining all possible sources of cp violation is a fundamental challenge for high energy physics . in economical viewpoint",
    ", it would be good if both leptonic- and quark - sector cpv phases are originated from a single source , for example , the one in the complex vacuum in the scpv  @xcite .",
    "there is a common problem in models with scpv , however , which is that a strong qcd @xmath12 term will be generated .",
    "however , a scpv can provide a solution to the strong cp problem , if the parameter @xmath12 related to the strong cp problem is vanishing at tree level and calculable at higher orders  @xcite .    we propose a model for the scpv based on an @xmath1 flavor symmetry for quarks and leptons in a seesaw framework .",
    "the seesaw mechanism , besides explaining of smallness of the measured neutrino masses , has another appealing feature : generating the observed baryon asymmetry in our universe by means of leptogenesis  @xcite .",
    "cp symmetry is spontaneously broken at high energies , after breaking of @xmath1 flavor symmetry , by a complex vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath1-triplet and gauge singlet scalar filed @xmath13 , which is introduced to give the correct flavor structure in the heavy neutrino sector .",
    "the main goal of our work is twofold : first , we investigate cp violation in the quark and lepton sectors and show how cp phases in both ckm and pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrices can be obtained simultaneously through spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "second , we show that the phase generated through the scpv can be a unique cp source of both ckm and pmns matrices , and discuss how to link between leptonic mixing and leptogenesis through the scpv .",
    "this work is an extension of that in  @xcite in such a way that ( i ) the @xmath1 flavor symmetry is spontaneously broken , and thereby a cp breaking phase is generated spontaneously , and ( ii ) in the quark sector all possible effective dimension-5 operators which are invariant under @xmath14 symmetry are introduced to explain the ckm matrix , while in the lepton sector the renomalizability constraint is kept .",
    "thus , our model can naturally explain both the ckm mixing parameters ( the three angles , @xmath15 , and the ckm cp phase @xmath16 ) and the pmns mixing angles ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we show the particle content and its representations under the @xmath18 flavor symmetry and an auxiliary @xmath19 symmetry in our model , as well as construct a higgs scalar and a yukawa lagrangian . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss how to realize the spontaneous breaking of cp symmetry , and then we outline the minimization of the scalar potential and the vacuum alignments . in sec .",
    "iv , we consider the phenomenology of quarks and leptons at low - energy , and in sec .",
    "v we study numerical analysis for neutrino oscillations and provide the data points for the ckm and pmns . in sec .",
    "vi we show possible leptogenesis and its link with low energy observables .",
    "we give our conclusions in sec .",
    "in the absence of flavor symmetries , particle masses and mixings are generally undetermined in a gauge theory . in order to understand the present data for quarks and leptons , especially , the ckm mixing angles ( @xmath15 with the ckm cp - phase @xmath16 ) and the nonzero @xmath7  @xcite and tri - bimaximal mixing ( tbm ) angles  @xcite ( @xmath3 ) for the neutrino oscillation data and baryogenesis via leptogenesis , as well as to predict a cp violation of the lepton sector , we propose a simple discrete symmetry model for the scpv based on an @xmath1 flavor symmetry for quarks and leptons . here",

    "we extend the sm by the inclusion of an @xmath18-triplet of right - handed @xmath44-singlet majorana neutrinos @xmath45 , and the introduction of three types of scalar higgs fields besides the sm - like @xmath44-doublet higgs bosons @xmath46 , which we take to be an @xmath18-triplet : a second @xmath44-doublet of higgs bosons @xmath47 , which is distinguished from @xmath46 by being an @xmath18-singlet with no @xmath21-flavor ( singlet representation ) , an @xmath44-singlet @xmath18-triplet scalar field @xmath13 : @xmath48    we assign each flavor of both leptons and right - handed quarks to one of the three @xmath18 singlet representations : the electron ( @xmath49 , @xmath50-quark)-flavor to the @xmath51 ( @xmath21-flavor 0 ) , the muon ( @xmath52 , @xmath53-quark ) flavor to the @xmath54 ( @xmath21-flavor -1 ) , and the tau ( @xmath55 , @xmath56-quark ) flavor to the @xmath57 ( @xmath21-flavor + 1 ) . and",

    "our model predicts that the effective mass @xmath479 is within the sensitivity of planned neutrinoless double - beta decay experiments .",
    "in addition to the explanation of the smallness of neutrino masses through seesaw mechanism by singlet heavy majorana neutrinos , in this model , the baryogenesis through so - called leptogenesis  @xcite can be realized from the decay of the singlet heavy majorana neutrinos . in early universe ,",
    "the decay of the right - handed heavy majorana neutrino into a lepton and scalar boson is able to generate a nonzero lepton asymmetry , which in turn gets recycled into a baryon asymmetry through non - perturbative sphaleron processes .",

    "so , both the charged and neutral scalars are physical .",

    "another important ingredient which should be carefully treated for successful leptogenesis is the wash - out factor @xmath493 arising mainly due to the inverse decay of the majorana neutrino @xmath486 into the lepton flavor @xmath494 @xcite .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath493 is given by @xmath495 where @xmath496 is the partial decay rate of the process @xmath497 , and @xmath498 with the planck mass @xmath499 gev is the hubble parameter at temperature @xmath500 and @xmath501 gev with the effective number of degrees of freedom given by @xmath502 .",
    "the factor @xmath493 depends on both heavy right - handed neutrino mass @xmath503 and neutrino yukawa coupling , and the produced cp - asymmetries are strongly washed out for a rather large neutrino yukawa coupling . in order for this enormously huge wash - out factor to be tolerated , we can consider a high leptogenesis scale . since the seesaw relation @xmath504 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) , the value of @xmath433 depends on the magnitude of @xmath102 once @xmath435 is determined . and since the neutrino yukawa couplings among them are mild hierarchical , the lepton asymmetry and the wash - out factor are roughly given as @xmath505 and @xmath506 , respectively .",
    "then , we get a rough estimation of bau whose magnitude should be order of @xmath507 from the product of @xmath508 and @xmath509 , and can naively estimate the scale of @xmath102 by appropriately taking the magnitude of @xmath433 ; for example , from @xmath510 one gets @xmath511 gev for @xmath512 and @xmath513 gev . from our numerical analysis",
