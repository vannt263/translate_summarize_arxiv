    "the increasing observational evidence associating supernovae ( sne ) and long gamma - ray bursts ( lgrbs ) ( see reviews by @xcite ) , supports scenarios like the magnetar @xcite and the collapsar @xcite , in which the death of a massive , rapidly rotating star is responsible for the formation of a lgrb . in the collapsar scenario ,",
    "the energy for the production of a lgrb is provided either by neutrino cooling @xcite , by the blandford - znajek ( bz ) mechanism @xcite , or a combination of both .",
    "the formation and evolution of the accretion disk has been studied in many hydrodynamical and mhd simulations of collapsars @xcite .",
    "it has been found that in order to have an effective neutrino cooling mechanism , the infalling material s angular momentum distribution @xmath5 , must be larger than the critical value @xmath6 needed to form an accretion disk around a schwarzschild bh @xcite .",
    "further work has focused in studying the importance of the progenitor s angular momentum distribution in the energy production mechanism @xcite . nevertheless ,",
    "only 2d hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite have studied in detail the effect of transitions in the angular momentum distribution between subcritical ( @xmath3 ) and supercritical ( @xmath2 ) values .",
    "such transitions in the angular momentum distribution have been obtained in sn and grb progenitor models , and are caused by convection at burning shells transporting angular momentum outwards from the inner part of the convection zone @xcite . however , if an effective mixing caused by magnetic torques and convection is present during the evolution of the long grb progenitor , it is possible that such transitions in the angular momentum are suppressed @xcite .",
    "the results from @xcite , show that in the scenario where the transition in the angular momentum distribution persists , the accretion disk formed from the collapse of supercritical material can in principle be completely destroyed by the infall of a massive enough subcritical shell ( @xmath7 times more massive than the supercritical shell ) .",
    "this produces a quiescent time where there is an inefficient conversion of potential to thermal energy in the quasi - radial accretion flow .",
    "however , the collapsar scenario is intrinsically a 3d problem , where instabilities can easily appear and break the axisymmetry assumed in 2d simulations . in a previous paper ( @xcite , hereafter bl14 )",
    ", we studied this process and in particular considered the formation of structure and gravitational instabilities within the infalling envelope when it is entirely supercritical in terms of its angular momentum distribution .    here",
    ", we now show the results of a new set of calculations performed in 3d using smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) with the code gadget-2 @xcite , of the collapse of rotating polytropic envelopes onto a bh .",
    "these simulations explore the importance of qualitative changes in the radial angular momentum distribution @xmath0 , as has been explored in 2d collapsar models by @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , strong asymmetries develop in the accretion flow , leading to important changes in the disk s response to the collapse of subcritical angular momentum material , and in the release of gravitational energy , when compared to the 2d hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the initial conditions and outline the input physics included in our simulations , the results are presented and briefly discussed in section 3 , and section 4 includes the analysis and conclusions from this work .",
    "we constructed polytropic envelopes as in bl14 , of mass @xmath8 , extending up to a radius @xmath9 , and with a dynamical time scale @xmath10 s , where @xmath11 accounts for the total mass of the system , which includes the @xmath12 bh fixed at the center of the distribution ( please refer to bl14 for further details ) .    the angular momentum given to the envelopes",
    "is initially inspired by the grb progenitors obtained by @xcite , in particular model 16 tb , in which @xmath0 shows drastic falls at different radii ( see top panel from fig .",
    "[ fig : jdist ] ) . such angular momentum distribution ( blue line ) has a supercritical innermost shell with mass @xmath13 extending up to a radius @xmath14 ( leftmost gray region at the top panel from fig .",
    "[ fig : jdist ] ) , where the angular momentum distribution of the envelope decreases drastically below @xmath15 ( red line ) , resulting in a shell extending from @xmath14 to @xmath16 , with mass @xmath17 and subcritical angular momentum ( red shaded region ) . moving outwards from @xmath14 to @xmath16 , the angular momentum of the shell increases , up to the point where it becomes supercritical at @xmath16 .",
    "this supercritical outer shell of mass @xmath18 extends from @xmath16 to @xmath19 ( rightmost gray shaded region in the top panel from fig .",
    "[ fig : jdist ] ) .    in order to reproduce and parametrize the features",
    "observed in the angular momentum of model 16 tb , we assigned to all our envelopes a rigid body angular momentum distribution @xmath20 , determined by a piecewise constant angular velocity @xmath21 and the position on the envelope @xmath22 , such that : @xmath23 where , @xmath24 is the distance to the origin , @xmath25 the azimuth angle ( playing no role on the rigid body rotation ) , @xmath26 is the polar angle ( where @xmath27 and @xmath28 correspond to the north pole , equator and south pole respectively ) and @xmath29 is a parameter that will be used to produce a drop in the angular momentum distribution at a radius @xmath14 .",
    "we chose an angular velocity of @xmath30 rad / s with specific angular momentum @xmath31 , to guarantee the formation of an accretion disk from the collapse of the innermost material at @xmath32 , where the critical angular momentum is : @xmath33 assuming that the inner mass @xmath34 will eventually be accreted by the bh .",

    "this is shown on the middle and rightmost bottom panels from figure [ fig : jdist ] . for a given scaling factor @xmath29 ,",
    "the position of @xmath14 determines the mass of both the supercritical ( at @xmath32 ) and the subcritical ( at @xmath48 ) angular momentum shells with masses @xmath13 and @xmath17 respectively , resulting in increasing mass ratios @xmath49 for smaller @xmath14 . on the other hand",
    ", the scale factor @xmath29 determines the depth of the fall in the angular momentum distribution at @xmath14 , and more importantly , it determines the position of the radius @xmath16 at which @xmath20 becomes supercritical again and the amount of supercritical material in the outermost shell @xmath18 .",
    "the introduction of the supercritical radius @xmath14 and the scaling factor @xmath29 , thus allows for a parametrization in terms of a varying mass , and angular momentum content of the subcritical infalling shell .",
    "table [ table2 ] shows the values used for the radius @xmath14 and the scaling factor @xmath29 in our simulations .",
    "as can be seen in the table , the mass ratio @xmath49 depends on both @xmath14 and @xmath29 , as do the fractional masses of the supercritical shells ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively ) scaled by the total mass on the supercritical shells @xmath52 .",
    "simulations with a scale factor @xmath53 have an outer supercritical shell that roughly accounts for @xmath54 of the total supercritical mass , meanwhile in simulations with a scale factor @xmath55 , it only accounts for @xmath56 of the supercritical mass , providing little supercritical material to replenish the accretion disk .",

    "the subcritical and supercritical envelope s masses ( @xmath17 , @xmath13 and @xmath18 respectively ) are determined by @xmath14 and @xmath29 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     due to the low angular momentum regime explored in this work , most of the material in our simulations is accreted quasi - radially in a few dynamical time scales , decreasing the resolution given by the number of sph particles .",
    "we addressed this issue by increasing the number of sph particles to @xmath57 in order to ensure that after the collapse of the entire envelope , the accretion disk had a similar resolution to the one used in bl14 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "as in bl14 , we made use of a paczynski - wiita ( pw ) potential for the bh @xcite and defined the accretion radius @xmath59 as the position of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) for a schwarzschild bh @xmath60 .",
    "the bh mass increases as it accretes sph particles , and thus @xmath61 and the accretion radius increase with time , modifying the pw potential and increasing the critical angular momentum @xmath15 needed to form an accretion disk . in the scenario we are exploring ,",
    "the accretion rates are dominated by the accretion of subcritical material .",
    "this would produce only a small increase in the bh s spin parameter @xmath62 , that changes the location of @xmath63 from @xmath64 to @xmath65 as @xmath66 increases from 0 to 1 .",
    "therefore , as long as @xmath67 , as is our case , a non rotating bh and a rotating kerr bh would behave very similarly , and the dynamics of infalling material should be the same .    for simplicity , we made use of the original eos from the code gadget-2 which makes use of an ideal gas eos , in terms of an entropic function @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the adiabatic index .",
    "we adopted the same cooling prescription as in bl14 , defined by the internal energy @xmath70 of the material and a characteristic cooling time scale @xmath71 , considering this to originate from neutrino emission .",
    "we used a single cooling time scale of @xmath72 s for our simulations , which guarantees the production of enough energy to power a grb and is also able to induce the production of spiral structure at the accretion disk ( bl14 ) .",
    "since our cooling implementation has a soft dependence on the internal energy of the envelope ( @xmath73 ) , variations in the cooling rate @xmath74 will not be as drastic as the ones that should be obtained for a more realistic neutrino cooling .",
    "nevertheless , this cooling gives the right order of magnitude for the neutrino luminosity and will track intense variations in the accretion flow as shown in bl14 .",
    "as the innermost supercritical shell reaches its centrifugal barrier around the bh , an accretion disk forms after @xmath75 s. this dense and hot material accumulates near the bh forming an outgoing shock that will slow down the infall of material at larger radii . as this shock evolves , intense asymmetries are formed ( as shown in figure [ fig : rhovr_xy ] ) , which contain high internal energy , low density material with important amounts of subcritical material .",
    "this indicates that they have formed , at least partly , from shocked low angular momentum material that got close to the bh but was not accreted .",
    "figure [ fig : rhovr_xy ] shows density cross sections at the xy plane ( left panels ) , and the angular momentum ratio @xmath39 ( right panels ) for sph particles located in a disk of scale height @xmath76 . the snapshots on this figure correspond to the simulation with the largest mass ratio ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "sph particles with @xmath78 and @xmath79 are colored yellow and red respectively , while particles with @xmath80 and @xmath81 are colored purple and blue respectively . since the mass of the bh and the infalling envelope are comparable , we calculated the critical angular momentum @xmath41 according to equation ( [ eqjc ] ) , considering that all interior mass @xmath34 ( bh , and sph particles ) contributes to determine if material at a radius @xmath24 has enough angular momentum @xmath20 to stay in a stable orbit around a bh with mass @xmath34 .",
    "the snapshots shown on figure [ fig : rhovr_xy ] correspond to three different times : the beginning of the collapse of the subcritical shell , the end of the collapse of the subcritical shell , and during the collapse of the outermost supercritical shell ( top , middle and bottom panels with @xmath82 and @xmath83 s , respectively ) . as figure [ fig : rhovr_xy ] shows",
    ", the dense accretion disk with @xmath84 ( blue to black colored region on the density plots ) is composed mostly of red and purple colored particles , which correspond to barely subcritical material ( @xmath85 ) and supercritical material ( @xmath40 ) respectively .",
    "both of these components are distributed anisotropically throughout the accretion disk , and the initial distribution is determined by a spiral pattern formed from the outgoing shock .",
    "the supercritical material distributed initially along this spiral pattern , gradually mixes with the subcritical material as shown in the middle right panel of figure [ fig : rhovr_xy ] .",
    "besides the mixing between subcritical and supercritical material observed in the spiral structures at the accretion disk s plane , there is also an important mixing of supercritical and subcritical material going on at different polar angles .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig : rhovr_xz ] where we show the density cross sections and the sph particles ratio @xmath39 along the xz plane .",
    "the densest part of the accretion disk ( @xmath86 ) is composed mostly by a combination of barely subcritical and supercritical material with @xmath87 ( red and purple colored respectively ) , with an important fraction of the barely subcritical material located above and below the accretion disk .",
    "this barely subcritical material surrounding the dense accretion disk will be able to fall onto the bh , without directly interacting with the supercritical material at smaller latitudes .",
    "the degree of mixing observed between subcritical and supercritical material at the accretion disk is only possible in 3d , since previous 2d calculations do not account for the possible mixing at the accretion disk s plane .",
    "this general morphological behavior was observed in all of our simulations , even in the one with no subcritical shell .",
    "however , by the end of the collapse of the polytropic envelope , the simulations with scaling factor @xmath55 had lost about @xmath88 of the supercritical material contained in the innermost shell with mass @xmath13 , this will be addressed in detail in the following sections .     of sph particles located in a disk of scale height @xmath76 , for the simulation with mass ratio @xmath89 .",

    "material in a rotationally supported accretion disk , should complete several orbits around the bh , before being accreted .",
    "however , if low angular momentum material falls on top of such an accretion disk at a radius @xmath24 , it will reach the bh in a time @xmath95 , determined by its radial velocity @xmath96 , and the distribution of material at the accretion disk , preventing its direct collapse .",
    "thus , as long as this low angular momentum material is able to spend enough time at the accretion disk before reaching the bh , it will form part of the accretion disk and contribute significantly to the neutrino cooling process and production of energy .",

    "the viscosity is defined by the @xmath100 parameter @xcite , the local sound speed @xmath101 and the disk s height @xmath102 . however , instead of implementing an @xmath100 viscosity in our simulations , we relied on the intrinsic sph artificial viscosity implemented in gadget-2 to mimic naturally occurring dissipative processes , which can be accounted as a rough approximate to an @xmath100 prescription @xcite .",
    "however , the viscosity wo nt be determinant in the evolution of the accretion disk , since the viscous time scale @xmath103 of our simulations ( ranging between @xmath104 s for a characteristic @xmath105 ) , is at least an order of magnitude larger than the other relevant time scales ( @xmath106 s , @xmath107 s and the total duration of the simulations @xmath108 ) .    to determine if material forms part of the accretion disk we will compare the time it will take it to complete a fraction of an orbit around the bh ( @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the angular velocity around the rotation axis ) , with the time it would take it to reach the bh with its current radial velocity ( @xmath111 ) . if @xmath112 then material will spend a significant amount of time at the accretion disk before reaching the bh .",

    "this sphere of radius @xmath120 completely covers the region observed in figures [ fig : rhovr_xy ] and [ fig : rhovr_xz ] and guarantees that the outermost uncollapsed material will not be accounted as part of the accretion disk .",

    "most of the supercritical material does not reach its centrifugal barrier , and is located along with subcritical material , safely away from the bh at the outer parts of the accretion disk ( as seen in figures [ fig : rhovr_xy ] and [ fig : rhovr_xz ] ) .",
    "figure [ mdisk_comp ] shows that the amount of subcritical material at the accretion disk continues to increase far beyond the end of the collapse of the subcritical shell , since the outermost supercritical shell is still feeding the accretion disk with subcritical material from above the equator . before @xmath156 s ,",
    "the subcritical material becomes the dominant component of the accretion disk , and its average radius @xmath153 approaches the accretion radius .",
    "it is when @xmath155 that the amount of subcritical material starts decreasing due to its rapid accretion onto the bh .",
    "this rapid decrease in @xmath17 reduces the amount of hot material contributing to the energy loss rate and is responsible for the steep decrease in the energy loss rate @xmath157 shown on figure [ mdotlum ] ( red line ) around @xmath158 s.      these simulations have a deeper drop in the angular momentum distribution at @xmath14 , compared to simulations with @xmath53 , which further reduces the angular momentum of the subcritical material .",
    "they also have a small outermost supercritical layer , which contains @xmath159 of the supercritical material of the infalling envelope .",
    "the later means that there wo nt be much supercritical material to replenish the accretion disk after the collapse of the subcritical shell .",
    "as subcritical material reaches the outer parts of the accretion disk , it slowly moves towards the bh until reaching an average radius @xmath160 at the end of the collapse of the subcritical shell ( dark shaded grey area on figure [ mdisk_comp ] ) .",
    "since the amount of angular momentum of this subcritical material is considerably lower than the angular momentum of subcritical material from simulations with @xmath53 , from this point on , subcritical material gets rapidly accreted , producing a violent decrease in the subcritical mass @xmath17 and the total mass of the accretion disk ( see figure [ mdiskall ] and top panel of figure [ mdisk_comp ] at @xmath161 s ) .",
    "the intense decrease in the accretion disk s mass produced by the rapid accretion of subcritical material , can be seen as the steep increase in @xmath147 shown in figure [ mdotlum ] around @xmath162 s , and it is also visible as the intense decrease in the energy loss rate @xmath157 reaching @xmath163 of its original value in @xmath164 s. since a significant amount of subcritical material was rapidly accreted , the value of the critical angular momentum @xmath165 , also increased very rapidly , reducing the amount of supercritical material .",
    "after this intense accretion event , there is only very little material to replenish the accretion disk , explaining the significantly reduced accretion and energy loss rates at later times .",
    "the 2d hydrodynamical simulations done by @xcite , found that the collapse of subcritical shells with mass ratios @xmath166 were able to completely disrupt the accretion disk transforming the accretion flow into a quasi radial inflow with low neutrino cooling efficiency .",
    "this result was obtained on both their simulations with subcritical shells with @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "in contrast , our 3d hydrodynamical simulations showed that increasing the mass ratio did not necessarily translated in the destruction of the accretion disk by the subcritical shell , since the simulation with the largest mass ratio @xmath169 managed to endure the collapse of such a massive subcritical shell .",
    "instead , simulations with subcritical shells with less angular momentum support ( smaller scaling factor @xmath29 ) were the ones that showed an overall decrease in the accretion disk s total and supercritical mass ( @xmath121 and @xmath152 respectively ) .",
    "the amount of angular momentum contained in the subcritical shell , determined by @xmath55 and @xmath170 , regulates the evolution of @xmath152 during the collapse of the subcritical shell . in simulations with smaller scaling factor @xmath29 ,",
    "the amount of supercritical material at the accretion disk @xmath152 decreased , contrary to the slight increase observed for simulations with @xmath53 .",
    "this increase in @xmath152 must come from barely subcritical material ( @xmath167 ) at the outer parts of the accretion disk , obtaining angular momentum from innermost material , by means of angular momentum transport mediated by the non - axisymmetic instabilities observed in figure [ fig : rhovr_xy ] , or also from fresh supercritical material being fed to the accretion disk region ( @xmath171 ) where @xmath152 was calculated . however , to explain the decrease observed in @xmath152 for simulations with @xmath55 we have to consider the following factors :    * there is very few barely subcritical material ( @xmath167 ) able to gain angular momentum and increase @xmath152 .",
    "simulations with @xmath53 had mostly barely subcritical material at the equator , which seems to have helped to increase and maintain the amount of supercritical material during the collapse of the subcritical shell .",
    "* since the bh is growing at a fast rate from accreting extremely subcritical material , some of the initially supercritical material will become subcritical due to the increase in @xmath15 .",
    "the growing bh mass increases the accretion radius , and the gravitational potential from the bh , reducing the supercritical material s circularization radius and thus , its mean radius @xmath172 .",
    "* finally , it is possible that part of the decrease in @xmath152 is due to the accretion of supercritical material by the bh , but it is only likely to be important when the average radius @xmath172 approaches @xmath173 , which only happens by the end of the collapse of the subcritical shell , thus , the fraction of supercritical material that approached the accretion radius @xmath59 should be small .",
    "results from figures [ mdiskall ] and [ mdisk_comp ] show that a large fraction of the supercritical material survived during most of the collapse of the subcritical shell with mass @xmath17 . however , if there is no `` fresh '' supercritical material being supplied to the accretion disk ,",
    "the formerly supercritical material will become subcritical as the bh s mass and @xmath15 increase from the accretion of subcritical material .",
    "this effect is visible on figure [ mdisk_comp ] for the simulations with @xmath55 , where @xmath152 with average radius @xmath174 reduces drastically after the rapid accretion of subcritical material observed at @xmath175 s.    we should also notice that the amount of subcritical material at the accretion disk and the time it takes for it to be accreted , increases with the amount of supercritical material contained in the innermost supercritical shell .",
    "this supercritical material prevents the direct collapse of subcritical material , allowing it to contribute to the energy loss rate before being accreted .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ mdisk_comp ] where an increasing mass ratio @xmath49 ( determined by a decrease in @xmath14 ) , turns into a small maximum mass @xmath17 at the accretion disk , and into an earlier decrease in @xmath17 after the collapse of the subcritical shell .      as shown in figure [ mdotlum ] ,",
    "the evolution of the accretion flow @xmath147 and the energy cooling rate @xmath146 , was mostly determined by the scale factor @xmath29 used in the simulation .",
    "this parameter is also critical in determining the cooling efficiency of the system @xmath176 $ ] , which tells us how efficiently are we extracting energy from the accretion flow . figure [ cooleff ] shows the cooling efficiency @xmath177 for all of our simulations . as expected , the simulation with no subcritical shell is the one with the highest cooling efficiency ( solid line ) , retaining a large amount of material close to the bh and contributing to the energy production for a long time .",
    "it is clear that the cooling efficiency is more sensitive to the scale factor @xmath29 than to the mass ratio @xmath49 , decreasing for smaller scale factors and increasing for smaller mass ratios @xmath49 .",
    "evolution as a function of time .",
    "same color lines correspond to simulations with the same radius @xmath14 and each line corresponds to a different initial mass ratio @xmath49 from table [ table2 ] as indicated on the figure.,width=326 ]    simulations with @xmath55 , i.e. with the smaller amount of angular momentum , were the ones with the lowest cooling efficiencies .",
    "the extremely low cooling efficiency of simulations with @xmath55 arises due to a rapid increase in the accretion rate followed by a decrease in the energy loss rate @xmath157 ( see figure [ mdotlum ] ) . both caused by the rapid accretion of subcritical material at @xmath175 s shown in the top panel of figure [ mdisk_comp ] .",
    "as figure [ cooleff ] shows , by @xmath178 s all simulations with @xmath179 have very similar cooling efficiencies .",
    "this means that they have all reached a very similar ratio between the accretion and the energy loss rates .",
    "nevertheless , in simulations with @xmath55 , the energy loss rate is considerably reduced by the end of the simulation , due to the small amount of supercritical material that was supplied throughout the collapse .",
    "figure [ rhodens ] shows the evolution of the mean density @xmath180 of the @xmath181 sph particles contained at the accretion disk within @xmath182 , for the simulations shown in figure [ mdotlum ] .",
    "simulations with @xmath55 show a steep decrease in the mean density @xmath183 which coincides with the rapid accretion of subcritical material around @xmath162 s. since our energy loss rate @xmath157 is proportional to the internal energy @xmath70 , and the internal energy is also proportional to the density , the overall energy loss rate decreases accordingly with the density , reaching the lowest values for simulations with @xmath55 .",
    "this intense decrease in @xmath183 would also decrease the total power extractable from the rotation of the bh and the accretion disk , since both the blandford - znajek mechanism , and the release of energy through magnetic torques at the rotating accretion disk , depend on the strength of the large scale magnetic field @xmath184 trapped in the vicinity of the bh , determined by the density of the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "therefore , the question one should ask in order to know if the infall of a subcritical shell will be able to shutdown the inner engine is the following : is the mass of the subcritical shell large enough to increase @xmath15 beyond the angular momentum of the innermost supercritical material ?",
    "if it is nt , the accretion disk is very likely to survive the collapse of the subcritical shell and still maintain a hot and dense disk structure .",
    "however , if the subcritical shell is massive enough to increase @xmath15 beyond the innermost supercritical shell s angular momentum , the survival of a hot and dense accretion disk depends on whether the outermost supercritical shell replenishes the accretion disk before all subcritical material gets accreted .",
    "thus , in order to increase the chances of the survival of a hot and dense accretion disk around the bh after the collapse of a really massive subcritical shell , the infalling envelope should meet the following conditions :    * the innermost supercritical shell should form a massive accretion disk .",
    "increasing the mass will help to delay the accretion of subcritical material , allowing outer supercritical material to reach the accretion disk before the bulk of the subcritical material gets accreted . *",
    "have a subcritical shell with barely subcritical material ( @xmath185 ) feeding the accretion disk .",
    "simulations with such envelopes ( @xmath53 ) showed a longer lasting accretion disk structure which allowed for the arrival of the outermost supercritical shell before the subcritical material at the accretion disk was completely accreted .",
    "* a massive outer supercritical shell must feed the disk before the bulk of the subcritical material contained at the accretion disk is accreted by the bh .",
    "otherwise the accretion of subcritical material will increase @xmath15 beyond the angular momentum of material at the accretion disk .",
    "this relatively simple criteria could be used to assess whether a lgrb progenitor with an angular momentum distribution like the ones explored in this work , will be able to show an inner engine shutdown due to the collapse of a subcritical shell on top of the accretion disk .     at radii @xmath186 , for the simulations shown on figure [ mdotlum ] .",
    "the huge drop in @xmath183 for the simulation with @xmath55 ( square points ) shown around @xmath187 s , corresponds to the drop in @xmath157 shown on figure [ mdotlum ] .",
    "the color indicates the total mass ( in solar masses ) contained in the accretion disk defined in the results section.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]      our 3d hydrodynamical simulations with angular momentum distributions parametrized by the mass ratio @xmath49 and the scale factor @xmath29 , allowed us to study how the energy production is affected by having subcritical angular momentum material falling onto a collapsar accretion disk .",
    "this is a plausible scenario observed in lgrb progenitors ( @xcite ) , however due to the narrow range of parameters explored , one should take care when extrapolating our results to different progenitors . here",
    "we summarize the most important conclusions drawn from our results :    * the intrinsic 3d nature of the collapsar scenario and the anisotropies developed during the collapse , prevents the accretion disk from being dragged into the bh by the infall of subcritical angular momentum material .",
    "the added degree of freedom along azimuth in the orbital plane combines with vertical motions ( already allowed in 2d calculations ) to allow for greater mixing of high and low - angular momentum material and distinct flows in the equatorial plane which greatly diminish the impact of infalling material onto a pre - existing disk , and allow for its survival . * the collapse of progenitors with transitions between supercritical and subcritical values in the angular momentum distribution ( as in fig [ fig : jdist ] ) , can lead to the production of large quiescent times originating from the absence of a hot accretion structure near the bh .",
    "however , the formation of such quiescent times is more difficult than previously thought , since it does not only depend on the mass ratio between the infalling subcritical shell and the innermost supercritical shell @xmath49 , but more importantly on the amount of angular momentum contained in the subcritical material , which determines if it will be accreted before fresh supercritical material is supplied to the disk . *",
    "the collapse of extremely subcritical material onto the accretion disk will result in a shutdown of the inner engine if the critical angular momentum @xmath15 increases beyond the angular momentum of material at the accretion disk , before it is resupplied with an important amount of supercritical material .",
