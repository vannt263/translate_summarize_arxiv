    "according to recent experiments@xcite , quasicrystals have curious ( for metallic materials ) transport properties . for example , anomalously high values of the low - temperature resistivity have been reported , and the resistivity goes down with introduction of defects or with increase of temperature .",
    "the anomalously high resistivity has been partly accounted for by the existence of a pseudogap at the fermi energy . for the temperature- or defect - dependence",
    "there is no clear consensus yet . in numerical simulations of 2-d systems ,",
    "fluctuating behavior for the resistance of a defected ( with @xmath0 disorder ) with respect to that of a pure system is observed , namely the resistivity can either go up or down@xcite .    here we attempt to address these behaviors for a 1-d system by focusing on the electronic @xmath1 in real space that actually determine the conductance .",
    "we study , for example , the scattering of electrons on a quasiperiodic ( fibonacci ) arrangement of @xmath2-function potentials ( a continuous model with the full phase coherence included ) . after determining the landauer conductance of a finite part of such a system",
    ", then we introduce a particular type of defect of a step - form in hyperspace@xcite ( called  phason - defect \" from now on ) and we study how this defect @xmath3 .",
    "this is therefore a study of the effect of an abrupt  phase \"- change in the structure ( with  phase \" defined in hyperspace ) on the phase - coherence of the electronic wavefunction in real space ( with phase defined in the usual quantum - mechanical way ) .",
    "( the role of the initial  phase \" of pure ( undefected ) chains on the resistance has been studied by other authors@xcite ) .",
    "the quasicrystalline structure can induce exotic ( critical ) states@xcite that are intermediate between localized and extended states . especially in the pure fibonacci chain",
    "all states are critical independent of values of parameters .",
    "one consequence that we observe , for a @xmath4 part of the fibonacci chain , is a rather unpredictably fluctuating variation of the landauer resistance with the length of the sample@xcite ( except when we are on special energy - regions of integrability , as we will see below ) .",
    "but in addition to this irregular variation for a pure fibonacci chain , we here also attempt the first study of the variation of the landauer resistance for the phason - defected system as well , both with respect to the length of the sample and also with respect to the position of the defect .",
    "the comparison of the resistances between the pure and the defected system shows some interesting regular patterns , provided that we are close to special points associated with the vanishing of the invariant @xmath5 of the underlying dynamical map@xcite ( on which points , both problems are integrable ) .",
    "in addition , in the majority of values of the parameters , the pure system is found to be more resistive than the defected one .",
    "it is also demonstrated that our use of a continuous model is critical in obtaining our results . as we show , these results would have actually been missed had one first made a tight - binding approximation ( i.e. keeping only nearest - neighbor overlaps ) .",
    "our work is therefore a concrete example of the danger@xcite that the usual discretized approximations incorporate , especially when systems with quasiperiodicity are considered , where subtle interference effects between the phase of the wavefunctions and the  phase \" in hyperspace can be expected .",
    "let us first use a tight - binding model , in order to compare with the fuller treatment that is given later . for simplicity",
    "we fix the fermi ( or incidence ) energy in the center of the band of the outside conductor ( coupled to the right and left of our finite system ) .",
    "we then study the scattering of an electron coming from the left with a wavevector @xmath6 , and we determine the landauer resistance@xcite of our finite system ( ratio of the reflection to the transmission coefficient ) .",
    "the method used for this is the standard transfer matrix method@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for a general ( mixed ) tight - binding model is @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath6 is the incident wavevector and @xmath10 is the lattice constant of the outside conductor (  out \" ) .",
    "the schrdinger equation then reads in matrix language    @xmath11    @xmath12    the landauer resistance ( for spin-@xmath13 fermions ) is then , in atomic unis ( @xmath14 )    @xmath15    with the matrix @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the total transfer matrix , namely @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are defined by    @xmath21 @xmath22      in this case @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "then @xmath25 , and two cases appear naturally :    @xmath26    @xmath27    case ( a ) gives oscillatory behavior of the resistance with size , while case ( b ) gives exponential increase for large size . in the intermediate case",
    "@xmath28 we have @xmath29 i.e. the resistance grows as the square of length . in the limit @xmath30 case ( a )",
    "corresponds to allowed energies ( bands ) , while case ( b ) to forbidden ones ( gaps ) .",
    "one can also trivially solve a periodic system with more complex unit cell ( e.g quasicrystalline approximants ) . in this case",
    "the phase @xmath31 depends on the internal structure of the unit cell and is a more complicated function of various parameters , but straightforward to determine for a given unit cell .",
    "finally , the introduction of even a single defect leads to interference effects that can easily be studied through this method .",
    "it is found@xcite that the behaviour in the presence of a defect seems to be correlated with whether we are in case ( a ) or ( b ) above .",
    "take for simplicity an off - diagonal model ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "also set @xmath33 .",
    "hopping elements @xmath34 are forced to take two values @xmath35 arranged in :    \\1 ) a fibonacci way 2 ) with a phason - defect ( corresponding to a",
    " phase \"- change of @xmath36 in hyperspace , with @xmath37 the golden mean ) , but in both cases in such a way as to comply with boundary conditions @xmath38 .",
    "this imposes restrictions on the possible values of n : n=5,13,18,26,34,39,47,52,60 , ...",
    "( their difference is seen to be a fibonacci arrangement of the numbers @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath41 we have @xmath42 where in the last line we show only one of the possible places where the defect ( i.e. an abrupt  phase \"- change of @xmath43 in the structure ; see fig.1 ) can be introduced .",
    "we now give an analytic solution for the landauer resistances of the two systems ( pure and defected ) :    for a given @xmath44 we find that @xmath45    with @xmath46 and @xmath47 an integer power ( of both signs ) that is an irregularly fluctuating function of the length @xmath44 ( around the value @xmath48 corresponding to complete transparency ) . we conclude ( for @xmath49 ) that for @xmath50 .",
    "we see that the appearance of such cases ( which we will call  favorable \" ) depends on the behavior of the pure chain with length ( this behavior fluctuates in an irregular fashion ) .    for big values of @xmath44",
    "we get 50% of this favorable behaviour .",
    "( we have also carried out cases of multi - defected sequences@xcite , where we also find irregularly fluctuating behavior , but with the _ scale _ of fluctuations being much higher ) .",
    "in this continuous case , which has the advantage of not suffering from truncation approximations , the matrix form of the schrdinger equation results from matching wavefunctions and derivatives at scattering points .",
    "this yields a generalized poincare map@xcite of the following form    @xmath51    with @xmath52    in the special case of a scattering potential of the form @xmath53 and with @xmath54 one obtains@xcite @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57      let us pause for a moment to see how a tight - binding approximation is usually derived : to change to a localized description one typically writes the wavefunction @xmath58 in terms of localized states @xmath59 , namely @xmath60 with @xmath61 and then neglects the overlap between distant @xmath59 s ; assuming that only nearest - neighbor overlaps are significant one obtains a tight - binding model with site and hopping elements@xcite @xmath62 @xmath63 and quasiperiodic arrangements ( @xmath64 s taking two values in a fibonacci sequence ) , which we later analyze in detail ( see subsection b below ) , we would just obtain a simple off - diagonal tight - binding approximation ( since in this case all the @xmath65 are identical ) .",
    "this demonstrates a defficiency of the tight - binding approximation , on which we now elaborate :    in the case of fibonacci arrangements ( let us say of both @xmath66 s and @xmath67 s ) and for @xmath68 ( a fibonacci number ) we have in the tight - binding approximation ( with definitions @xmath69 , with @xmath70 s given in the well known@xcite recursive scheme @xmath71 , with starting matrices @xmath72 , and @xmath73 and hence the usual trace map@xcite @xmath74 ( with the definition @xmath75 ) .",
    "this map has the well - known invariant @xmath76 .",
    "straightforward evaluation for the above case yields @xmath77    in our case of a simple off - diagonal model ( i.e. @xmath78 ) ( but also for the case of diagonal models ( i.e. @xmath79 ) ) i is e - independent as seen from , always positive , and it never vanishes .",
    "this is a deficiency of the approximation , as discussed below .",
    "( note that even in the case of a mixed model , where @xmath5 vanishes only for a single value of @xmath80 , the elementary matrices @xmath70 do @xmath81 commute at this value , which is a major difference with the full continuous model , as will be discussed in subsection b ) .",
    "we will see below that , because of implicit truncation errors , the tight - binding models miss interesting patterns associated with the @xmath82 of the invariant @xmath5 of the underlying dynamical map , where the basic matrices commute .",
    "these are actually relevant to conduction and are treated next ( in subsection b ) in the continuous schrdinger formulation .",
    "let us first discuss a problem where the scattering potential is an array of equally - spaced ( with length @xmath10 ) @xmath2-functions of equal strengths ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "then , again two cases appear naturally ( we take @xmath84 , or , equivalently , replace everywhere @xmath6 by @xmath85 in what follows ) :    \\a ) for @xmath86 with @xmath31 defined by @xmath87 ( which is seen to be the same as in the usual treatment of the krnig - penney model@xcite for the case of allowed bands ( for @xmath88 ) ) .",
    "we note again the oscillatory behavior of the resistance with length .",
    "it is easy to show that the naturally appearing phase @xmath31 determines the crystal momentum @xmath89 through @xmath90 ( with such an identification , the resulting wavefunctions indeed satisfy the bloch theorem , as can be easily checked ) .",
    "we can also see that the zeros of @xmath91 determine the allowed values of @xmath89 ( from band theory ) for the @xmath92 periodic system .",
    "this is an important point , because it motivates our later treatment of a fibonacci problem , where we will enforce the vanishing of the resistance in order to simulate the thermodynamic limit .",
    "\\b ) for @xmath93 with @xmath31 defined by @xmath94 .",
    "this corresponds to the case of gaps in the limit @xmath88 .",
    "indeed the resistance grows exponentially as @xmath88 . in this case",
    ", wavefunctions decrease with a characteristic length @xmath95 once again the study of complex unit cells is of course possible .",
    "also the introduction of a single defect results in interference effects that can be easily studied through this method .      in the pure case a recursive procedure of the form @xmath71 can also be established for this case ( with starting matrices depending on the description ) .",
    "for example , in the case of equally spaced ( @xmath10 ) @xmath2-potentials with @xmath96 in fibonacci arrangement , a natural description is the one given in the previous section ( in terms of matrices @xmath97 ) ( with @xmath98 ) . then the invariant is @xmath99 i.e. @xmath100 .",
    "( its zeros constitute a periodic pattern @xmath101 , ( @xmath102 ) ) .",
    "@xmath103 : the system , however , we will analyze in detail corresponds to @xmath2-potentials with equal strengths ( @xmath83 ) but quasiperiodic arrangements @xmath104 in fibonacci arrangement@xcite , as already mentioned earlier .    in this case ,",
    "an alternative description ( in terms of the coefficients @xmath105 and @xmath106 of the two linearly independent plane waves in the region between two @xmath2 potentials ) is more natural .",
    "one obtains@xcite @xmath107 with @xmath108 for @xmath2-potentials ( once again we have set @xmath109 ) . in this description the landauer resistance is given again by @xmath110 with @xmath17 the product of @xmath111 s , namely @xmath112 .",
    "in this case the invariant @xmath5 of the underlying dynamical map turns out to be@xcite @xmath113 i.e. also @xmath100 .",
    "its zeros now constitute a periodic pattern @xmath114 and will be the focus of our work in what follows .",
    "these special points @xmath115 are missed in the corresponding tight - binding model , as we showed earlier . in the present continuous model they turn out to correspond to commuting consecutive matrices , i.e. @xmath116=0\\;\\;$ ]",
    "( which is consistent with the known relation@xcite @xmath117 ) , but even stronger , they lead to commuting elementary matrices [ contnewmatrix ] .",
    "indeed , it turns out that @xmath118 = \\lambda \\ ; { { e^{i k ( a - b)}}\\over { 4 k^2}}\\ ; ( 1-e^{2 i k ( b - a ) } ) \\pmatrix { \\lambda & \\lambda-2 i k \\\\",
    "-\\lambda-2 i k & -\\lambda\\\\ } \\ ] ] which vanishes for all special points @xmath119 .",
    "one can therefore say that , from a conduction point of view , the problem looks formally similar to a periodic problem .",
    "this is more concretely described through the following properties of the special points @xmath120 :    \\1 ) they are the conducting points ( extended states ) surviving@xcite in the limit @xmath30 .",
    "\\2 ) the landauer resistance can be written @xmath121 in closed form for @xmath122 , and the expression looks like that of a periodic system ( see below ) .",
    "\\3 ) the set of points @xmath115 is robust@xcite against disorder ( essentialy because of the above mentioned commutations ) .",
    "in fact it exists either for a periodic or for a random system ( of two letters ) .    in what follows ,",
    "we focus on these points @xmath123 with @xmath124,@xmath125 ( fibonacci chain ) : exactly on those points we get the landauer resistance in closed form ( for the fibonacci or any disordered system of @xmath126 ) : @xmath127 with @xmath31 defined by @xmath128 ( for @xmath129 ) .    motivated by our earlier discussion on a finite piece of a periodic system ( where we saw that the values of @xmath6 that made the oscillating resistance @xmath130 correspond to the allowed states of the @xmath92 system ) , we now @xmath131 a conducting behavior ( resonance ) : for any fixed @xmath44 , we choose @xmath83 in such a way as to have a vanishing resistance ( exactly at @xmath132 ) , namely @xmath133 ( for @xmath134 the pure fibonacci and the phason - defected system ) .",
    "( this gives the representative behavior in the thermodynamic limit where this vanishing is actually expected for @xmath135 and for any @xmath83 ; see below ) . as a consequence we get @xmath136 different appropriate values of @xmath83 ( both positive and negative ) given by @xmath137 with the internal phase @xmath138 defined by @xmath139 with @xmath140 that correspond to vanishing @xmath141 the @xmath136 values of the phase @xmath138",
    "are symmetrically placed around @xmath142 and as @xmath44 increases they cover densely the entire upper half of the trigonometric circle .",
    "consequently , the vanishing of @xmath143 _ is _ representative of the behavior in the thermodynamic limit for @xmath144 arbitrary value of @xmath83 , and that is the reason we enforce it even for a finite system . by doing so",
    ", we then study the behavior @xmath145 the conduction points @xmath146 .",
    "below we summarize our results on the behavior of the resistance , of both the pure and the defected system , as @xmath6 varies in the local neighborhood of the conduction points @xmath115 :    1 ) .",
    "smallest system ( consistent with boundary conditions ) : @xmath147    the results are given in fig.2 , where we show the local regions around the lowest conducting point ( @xmath148 ) for one value of @xmath138 , showing that the resistance of the defected system @xmath149 @xmath150 @xmath151 than the one of the pure system ( this is also true for _ any _ @xmath138 ) .",
    "we also show the complicated behavior of the landauer resistance in more extended regions around a special point and for one particular @xmath138 .",
    "of course the problem is analytically solvable . by way of an example",
    "we give the analytical solution for @xmath148 ( @xmath152 ) , @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) which is @xmath155 @xmath156    this is the typical behavior for @xmath157 points examined ( @xmath158 , all @xmath159 s ) i.e. the landauer resistance of the phason - defected system around the conducting points @xmath115 , rises ( from zero ) @xmath149 @xmath151 than the corresponding one for the pure system .",
    "2).@xmath160    extensive numerical results have been obtained in this case , where we have @xmath161 possible defected systems , for @xmath158 and for all @xmath162 phases @xmath138 . out of those @xmath162 cases , in @xmath39 of them @xmath157 three defected systems have landauer resistances @xmath151 than that of the pure system . in only @xmath163 cases one defected sequence rises slightly higher and also in @xmath163 other cases another sequence also rises slightly higher than the pure system .",
    "we call these few cases ( where the defected system is more resistive )  unfavorable cases \" .",
    "\\3 ) long chains    we have carried out numerical calculations on chains up to more than 3000 sites , taking as a numerical convergence criterium the unitarity condition of our total transfer matrices .    because of the full phase coherence , the transmission behavior of the defected chains depends on the discrete position @xmath164 of the defect in interesting ways . in long chains",
    "the variable @xmath164 becomes quasi - continuous , and the discrete and asymmetric patterns found for small chains ( see for example fig.3 and fig .",
    "4-c ) , now appear smooth and symmetric ( fig.4-a and fig.4-b ) . moreover , their actual form depends on the value of @xmath138 , which can be considered as a discrete label parametrizing the family of potential strengths @xmath83 that enforce vanishing of resistance on specials points .",
    "the results show interesting patterns summarized below and shown pictorially in fig.5 .",
    "we observe a symmetry in the qualitative behavior around the value @xmath165 ( although the values of @xmath83 corresponding to symmetric values of @xmath138 are always different , as seen from equ .",
    "[ lambdas ] . up to this symmetry",
    ", we also observe a type of recurrent simplicity in the resistive behavior of the defected system , which we loosely call  cyclic \" ( with period @xmath17 ) . for",
    "small to medium values of @xmath138 ( in more detail , for @xmath166 , with @xmath159 defined by @xmath167 and with @xmath17 being the number of possible defect - points ( note that for a given chain - length @xmath44 there is a unique @xmath17 always satisfying the inequality @xmath168 for any @xmath169 ) , we observe _ exceedingly _ simple oscillatory patterns ( fig.4 ) .",
    "furthermore , we observe that in these cases the defected system is _ always _ less resistive than the pure one .    a qualitatively similar behavior is observed in the mirror symmetric region ( see the two shaded regions in fig.5 ) .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the above  favorable \" behavior is valid for sufficiently strong absolute values of @xmath83 , namely @xmath170 with @xmath171 , with the lower sign corresponding to the 1st and the upper sign to the 2nd quadrant of the upper half of the trigonometric circle .",
    "as @xmath159 increases towards @xmath17 we observe additional fluctuations resulting in a rather regular modulated pattern , containing a finite and small number of harmonic modes ( fig.6 ) the above mentioned  cycles \" in the recurrence of the simplest behavior , occur whenever @xmath159 approaches @xmath172 ( again up to the symmetry around @xmath173 ) . as we cross the cycles we also observe abrupt changes of ordering in the resistance of the defected with respect to that of the pure chain ( fig.7 ) .",
    "finally , close to the symmetry point @xmath174 we observe largely fluctuating and modulated patterns that look self - similar ( fig.8 ) .",
    "these resistive patterns become chaotic ( fig.8(c ) ) when we move sufficiently far from the special integrability points .",
    "( the above numerical observations are stable upon approaching the special point ( i.e. decreasing @xmath66 ) up to the lowest value of @xmath66 where our convergence criterion is satisfied .",
    "we view the above results ( summarized pictorially in fig.5 ) as interference effects between the abrupt  phase \"- change in hyperspace ( that occurs at some point in physical space ) , and the phase of the wavefunction at that point . the landauer resistance viewed as a function of the discrete variable @xmath175 ( that actually corresponds to a family of different physical systems ) is here seen to carry a",
    " memory \" of the hyperspace by showing a type of  hyper - coherence \" , that depends on physical parameters in rather subtle ways .",
    "the landauer resistance at finite temperatures is given by@xcite @xmath177 with @xmath178 , @xmath179 .",
    "for @xmath180 the transmission coefficients @xmath181 s are dominant@xcite in the local regions around the special points @xmath115 ( studied on last pages ) .",
    "because of the smearing of the fermi function at low temperatures , the behavior of the landauer resistance with temperature depends on the location of the fermi energy @xmath182 . if @xmath182 is close to a special energy ( i.e. if @xmath183 ) then the decrease or increase of @xmath184 of the defected system compared to the pure system , depends on whether this particular @xmath115 is a favorable or unfavorable point in the sense discussed on the previous pages .",
    "we conclude therefore , from our results above , that , statistically speaking , in the majority of cases the resistance will decrease upon increase of temperature .",
    "motivated by the anomalous transport properties of quasicrystals with defect and temperature , we have analysed the role of phason - defects on the landauer resistance of a finite fibonacci chain . in a tight - binding model with incident energy",
    "being fixed at the center of the band , the resistance is modified in an irregular fashion and in accordance with the behavior of the pure fibonacci chain with the size of the system , with both positive and negative effect appearing statistically in equal percentage . in a fuller treatment of the continuous schrdinger equation with @xmath2-function potentials , the modification of the resistance depends on the location of the fermi level with respect to special energies corresponding to extended states , and also on the position of the defect . for finite chains , the majority of cases studied show a decrease of the landauer resistance upon introduction of defect and temperature .    by comparing the two models , we have noted that continuous models , being free from truncation errors , preserve the phase coherence important for conductance and can reveal subtle additional effects .",
    "such effects of interference between this coherence and the hyperspace construction have also been presented .",
    "it is interesting that most of the time , these give rise to exceedingly simple behaviors .",
    "although we do not study the thermodynamic limit with any rigor , the finite @xmath44 results are @xmath185 @xmath186 because of the self - similarity in the resistance v.s . length behavior .",
    "our focus on the local behaviors around the special conducting points @xmath115 is justified by the fact that these are the only points relevant to conduction for @xmath187 , so that our results on resistance patterns should be representative for big systems .",
