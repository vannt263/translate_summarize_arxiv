    "in recent years , many efforts have been exerted to implement all - optical quantum devices  @xcite that can coherently control photons through photons  p2p-1,p2p-2,p2p-3,p2p-4,p2p-5 .",
    "this application - oriented pursuit requires the possible existence of a strong and controllable photon - photon interaction . from the view of modern physics , photons",
    "do not couple to each other directly through fundamental electromagnetic interactions ; however , people recognized that two photons interact indirectly via nonlinear media  @xcite .",
    "such nonlinear interactions are usually obtained through high - order perturbation theories and hence can not be arbitrarily manipulated according to one s will .",
    "nevertheless , inside some artificial medium , the transport of photons can be well controlled by an additional intervening classical field  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit this problem of photon transportation under a coherent architecture , based on the theoretical approach we have developed in ref .",
    "we propose that a coupled cavity - array , regarded as an one - dimensional ( 1d ) continuum , provides a transport channel to an incident single photon .",
    "placed inside one of the cavities , a @xmath0-type three - level atom can either grant or block the path of the single photon by the atom s electromagnetic induced transparency ( eit ) effect .",
    "this atom can essentially be regarded as a functional quantum node ( fqn ) .",
    "in fact , a similar mechanism has been used to build the so - called single - photon transistor , analogous to an electronic transistor in which an atom plays the role of the gate through its absorption and emission of photons to - and - fro a channel  @xcite .    in comparison with the design of the `` single - photon transistor '' , in which the photon travels continuously through a fiber waveguide",
    ", our cavity - array lets the photon travel discretely through the channel by locally creating or annihilating a photon between its cavities .",
    "we hence consider the coherent scattering process of the photon with the forementioned fqn in the discrete coordinate representation .",
    "our approach is then a generalization of the 1d process where a photon is scattered by the @xmath1-potential set up by a fqn through its eit effect into the discrete space .",
    "such an approach raises a richer spectrum structure indicated by its nonlinear dispersion relation resulting from the tight - binding inter - cavity coupling , as opposed to the usual linear dispersion relations . because of the unusual dispersion relation",
    ", we develop a new approach for the transport of the single photon , which is different from the effective field approach  @xcite normally adopted ; yet the high energy limit of our setup can cover the main results of the theoretical approaches of similar single - photon transistor designs  @xcite .",
    "we generalize the discrete scattering method recently proposed  @xcite and calculate the reflection and the transmission coefficients of the single - photon transport as functions of both the rabi frequency and the level spacing between the excited state and the metastable state of the fqn . the reflection and the transmission spectra of the photon",
    "are depicted by general lineshapes whose ranges cover both the high - energy end at the breit - wigner limit and the low - energy end at the fano - feshbach limit . as emphasized , it is the classical field that control the system to reach such high energy and low energy limits .",
    "our derivations show that the @xmath0-type fqn can behave as a perfect mirror to totally reflect the incident photon when the rabi frequency matches the frequency of the controlling classical field .",
    "the behavior of the fqn has suggested a basic mechanism to implement all - optical control for single - photon transports and provides the ground for a photon storage device through controllable quasibound states , which are defined in ref .",

    "one is to place artificial @xmath0-type atoms in the 1d defect cavities of a 2d optical crystals [ cite : greentree ] .",
    "the other is to use an 1d superconducting transmission line of resonators controlled by a three - level josephson junction . both the optical crystal line - cavity and the superconducting transmission - line resonators provide the 1d continuum for coherent transport of photons .",

    ", we can adjust the reflection and the transmission of light through the atom and thus manipulate the propagation of the single photon in the 1d continuum .",
    "the single photon process defines a conversation rule of total occupation number ( photons in the cavities plus the excitations of the atom ) .",

    ", the cl can be regarded as the distance that the photon travels between the left side and the right side of the scatterer ( the three - level system ) . actually , to make sure that the scattering process can happen , it is required that the photon leakage rate @xmath122 for each resonator is much smaller than the hopping constant , otherwise photons will totally escape into the environment before encountering the scatterer .",

    "accordingly , we first assume the scattering state to be@xmath135 where @xmath60 and @xmath136 are the reflection and the transmission coefficients at the zeroth site , whereas @xmath137 and @xmath61 are those at the @xmath99-th site .",

    "the quasi - bound state then occurs when the denominators of the two coefficients equal to zero , which corresponds to the condition    @xmath139    from which the momentum @xmath63 of a single photon surviving between the potentials @xmath106 and @xmath107 is determined .",
    "the incident photon corresponding to this intra - cavity photon has its momentum take imaginary values , which in turn leads to its imaginary energy .",
    "the imaginary energy will result in a decay of the wavefunction , which means the quasi - bound state is a bound state with a small leakage at two ends .",
    "when @xmath140 , it is almost impossible for a single photon to propagate in the channel and quasi - bound states are formed in the secondary cavity .",
    "the most interesting quasi - bound state can be obtained when both fqn s are tuned to their resonant states , where@xmath141 the above formula subjects the momentum of the trapped photon to a quantized value @xmath142 where @xmath143 is an arbitrary integer .",
    "the corresponding bound state is@xmath144 where @xmath145 is the normalization constant .",
    "so the incident photon can be perfectly trapped between the two fqn s , similar to what happens in a single cavity .",
    "we hence name this setup a perfect secondary cavity , which realizes a non - destructive single photon storage .",
    "compared to the proposals of quantum memories based on the dark state in the eit effect , our secondary cavity setup is much easier to implement . in the former ,",
    "the dark state is stationary and the classical field is adiabatically manipulated to store information from the incident photon to the three - level atom .",
    "such a process should be regarded as a stationary storage and demands highly precise control over the external control field . whereas , the secondary cavity proposed here is dynamic and the control parameters , including the distance @xmath99 between the fqn s , the rabi frequency @xmath79 , and the frequency @xmath5 of the external field , are all much easier to manipulate .",
    "the storage process can be imagined as disposing two perfectly reflecting `` mirrors '' in the cavity - array such that a single photon originally traveling in the array is bounded in between to become a standing wave .",
    "the releasing process is to inversely remove these two reflecting `` mirrors '' .",
    "we have revisited the problem of single photon transport in an 1d cavity - array with a deposited three - level @xmath10-type fqn and illustrated how the reflection and the transmission coefficients rely on the rabi frequency and the traveling frequency of a classical control field external to the cavity array . by tuning these two frequencies ,",
    "the fqn can serve as a perfect mirror  or a transparent medium for an incident photon .",
    "the appearance of lineshapes different from the conventional breit - wigner or fano - feshbach type was shown to stem from a nonlinear dispersion relation and the eit mechanism in the setup .",
    "the dissipation of cavities and atom are taken into account .",
    "the atomic decay is added phenomenologically to explain the single photon undergo an inelastic scattering process .",
    "the cavities decay mainly determine the coherent length , which limit the upper number of cavities .    using this phenomenon ,",
    "we have proposed a secondary cavity between two fqn s , in which a controllable quasibound state can be formed , to coherently store a single photon .",
    "a perfect secondary cavity selects photons with momenta being integral mutiples of a constant .",
    "the limiting lossless case has also been presented to compare with the usual photon storage using an eit dark state .",

    "<S> we show that , through the electromagnetic induced transparency ( eit ) mechanism , the @xmath0-type fqn bears complete control over the reflection and transmission of the incident photon along the cavity - array . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate the emergence of a quasibound state of the single photon inside a secondary cavity constructed by two distant fqn s as two end mirrors , from which we are motivated to design an all - optical single photon storage device of quantum coherence . </S>"
