    "a collapse is a fast , collective phenomenon consisting in the destruction of a multi - particle system happening abruptly on the time scale which governs the `` usual dynamics '' .",
    "one example is the gravitational core collapse initiating a supernova . happening within milliseconds ,",
    "its duration is negligible compared to any of the time scales related to the preceding fusion stages  @xcite .    in contrary to a supernova , where the experimenter is condemned to be an observer only , bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) are excellent adjustable systems .",
    "tailoring both the external confining potential and the interaction between the atoms allows to control the properties of the condensate .",
    "it is not only an ideal system to study questions from condensed matter physics  @xcite , but the dynamics of a collapse as well .",
    "collapsing condensates were first observed in @xmath0li  @xcite and @xmath1rb  @xcite .",
    "both systems are characterized by the contact interaction , which is described by a single parameter , the @xmath2-wave scattering length @xmath3 . from a simple model  @xcite minimizing the gross - pitaevskii energy functional using a gaussian ansatz for the wave function",
    ", one can understand the instability threshold .",
    "the energy functional consists of three terms : ( _ i _ ) the kinetic energy , which , in the sub - micro kelvin range of almost pure condensates , is equal to the quantum pressure ( arising from the heisenberg uncertainty principle in the trap potential ) , ( _ ii _ ) the harmonic trapping potential , and ( _ iii _ ) the interaction energy . for repulsive contact interaction ( @xmath4 ) a global minimum exists , and the condensate is stable . for small enough attractive interactions ( @xmath5 ) ,",
    "only a _ local _",
    "minimum exists at finite size ; the condensate is metastable . finally , for sufficiently attractive interaction the local minimum vanishes",
    "the potential energy of the bec can be lowered without bound by contraction .",
    "thus , the condensate is unstable .    as the density increases , this model is too simple to describe the physics of the unstable cloud  atom losses due to three - body collisions have to be included .",
    "being negligible at low densities , the three - body collision rate rapidly increases as the cloud shrinks .",
    "a three - body collision allows for the production of a dimer , where the third contributing atom is needed to fulfill energy and momentum conservation .",
    "the binding energy which is absorbed by the atom and the molecule in form of kinetic energy is sufficient for both to escape from the trap .",
    "hence , instead of reaching a fully contracted `` point - like '' state , more and more atoms are lost , so that eventually the quantum pressure dominates over the remaining interaction energy .",
    "the dynamics inverts , the atoms accelerate outwards to the _ new _ equilibrium state . because the three - body losses have changed the total energy , this new equilibrium state differs from the initial one .    inducing the collapse in a condensate with non - negligible dipolar interactions changes the dynamics completely .",
    "while the contact interaction is short - range and spherically symmetric , the dipolar interaction is long - range and cylindrically symmetric ( partially attractive and partially repulsive ) .",
    "therefore , dipolar condensates exhibit many novel phenomena even in non - collapsing systems  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy of the dipolar interaction can also be used to change the mechanism for the collapse  either driving or stabilizing the collapse : in a cigar - shaped trap with the dipoles oriented along the long axis the atoms experience predominantly the attractive part of the dipolar mean - field potential  @xcite .",
    "hence , the collapse is _ driven _ by the dipolar interaction , while the contact interaction stabilizes the condensate .",
    "the instability occurs at positive scattering length .",
    "this situation is reversed if the dipoles are confined in a pancake - shaped trap .",
    "now their dipolar interaction is essentially repulsive .",
    "the dipolar interaction _ stabilizes _ the condensate and the condensate is able to withstand negative scattering lengths for which a purely contact interacting bec would have become unstable already  @xcite .",
    "the instability occurs at negative scattering length .",
    "this simple consideration strongly suggests that different trap geometries result in different collapse dynamics .",
    "in this paper we study the collapse of a chromium condensate under the influence of magnetic dipole interaction  @xcite . after describing our experimental procedure to induce the collapse",
    ", we compare the experimental data for different trapping potentials with 3d simulations of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) including three - body losses .",
    "we show that this model provides a good description of the experimental data .",
    "this is not clear _ a priori _ as one might expect that the collapse dynamics induces many - body quantum correlations , while the gpe is a mean - field description , not taking correlations into account . finally , we prove that the collapsed atomic cloud contains a remnant _ condensate _ by probing its phase coherence .",
    "although simulations for purely contact interacting becs have shown  @xcite that the observed bursts and jets of a collapsing condensate should be coherent , this had not been tested experimentally to date .",
    "in order to create a condensate dominated by the dipolar interaction , we exploit the broadest of the observed feshbach resonances in @xmath6cr  @xcite . in the vicinity of this feshbach resonance ,",
    "the scattering length varies with the applied magnetic field @xmath7 as  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9  g is the position of the feshbach resonance , @xmath10  g is its width and @xmath11 is the background scattering length , with @xmath12 the bohr radius . the magnetic field is directed along the @xmath13-direction and determines the orientation of the dipoles . using the experimental procedure described in  @xcite",
    ", a condensate of approximately @xmath14 atoms is formed in a crossed far - detuned optical dipole trap at @xmath15 above the feshbach resonance .",
    "we then shape the external confining potentials to obtain the desired ratio of the trapping frequencies @xmath16 by adjusting the power in the crossed dipole trap and superimposing ( only for pancake - shaped traps @xmath17 ) an additional one - dimensional optical lattice along the @xmath13-direction .",
    "the superimposed lattice is formed by two far - detuned beams ( wavelength @xmath18  nm ) crossing under a small angle ( @xmath19 ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : exp_setup ] .",
    "this results in a relatively large spacing of @xmath20=(7.4\\pm0.2)~\\mu$]m between neighboring lattice sites .     at the position of the atoms ( green ) with respect to the ramps of the offset coils ( red ) .",
    "the time @xmath21 is defined as the additional holding time of the atoms in the optical trap after finishing the second magnetic field ramp , before the time - of - flight .",
    "( c ) the corresponding scattering length in units of @xmath22 . ]",
    "[ fig : eddycurrent ]    we first adiabatically ramp the current in the offset coils linearly in 8  ms to a scattering length @xmath23 close to the point where the collapse occurs , and wait for 1  ms for the eddy currents ( mainly due to copper gaskets in our experimental chamber ) to faint out .",
    "thus , the magnetic field @xmath24 at the position of the atoms does not follow the ramp instantaneously , but must be calculated according to the equation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the magnetic field produced by the offset coils ( changed linearly during ramps ) and @xmath27  ms is the @xmath28 lifetime of the eddy currents , measured by zeeman spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "after 1  ms of waiting time at @xmath23 , we start a second ramp from @xmath23 to @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the critical scattering length for the given trapping potential  @xcite , so that the collapse occurs . we hold the atoms in the trap for an additional time @xmath21 at @xmath31 before releasing them and taking a time - of - flight image . in order to get the maximal absorption cross section , we split the time - of - flight into two parts : a first one , lasting 4  ms , at the magnetic field corresponding to @xmath31 ( in order not to disturb the dynamics ) and a second part , lasting again 4  ms , where the large magnetic field along @xmath13 is replaced by a field of 11  g along the @xmath32-direction .",
    "we checked that this procedure does not disturb the image .",
    "the observed integrated density distribution is bimodal and consists of a broad isotropic thermal cloud and an anisotropic remnant bec ( see e.g. fig  1(b ) of  @xcite ) . because the size of the thermal cloud as well as its atom number does not depend on @xmath21 ,",
    "it is unlikely to contribute to the collapse dynamics . in the following ,",
    "we have subtracted it from the images to increase the contrast .",
    "the anisotropic character of the dipolar interaction ( dipoles side - by - side repel each other , while dipoles in a head - to - tail configuration attract each other ) has a strong effect on the stability of a dipolar condensate : varying the geometry of the confining harmonic trap from prolate to oblate ( the symmetry axis being the one along which the dipoles are aligned ) stabilizes the condensate , as was demonstrated experimentally in  @xcite .",
    "our previous experimental study of the collapse dynamics of a dipolar condensate  @xcite was restricted to an almost spherical trap ; in the following we study the influence of the trap geometry on the collapse dynamics .",

    "this is explicitly shown in figure  [ fig : not - collpased - state ]  ( d ) : the atom number does not drop `` abruptly '' to its final value , but instead it changes linearly on the time scale @xmath46 . therefore , in the case of figure  [ fig : not - collpased - state ] we observe only a `` moderate '' collapse .     in a weakly cigar - shaped trap with trap frequencies",

    "the imaginary term describes the atom losses .",
    "the simulations contain _",
    "no _ free parameter , as the three - body coefficient @xmath63 was estimated from measurements .",
    "details about the simulations are described in  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 - 50 - 0collapse_pics ] shows the collapse in a cigar - shaped trap with trapping frequencies @xmath47  hz , corresponding to @xmath64 , and radial trapping period @xmath65  ms .",
    "we start with @xmath66 atoms before ramping the scattering length from @xmath67 to @xmath68 , which lies @xmath69 below the critical scattering length .",
    "the absorption images indicate three different stages : first , for @xmath70  ms , the condensate is strongly elongated along the magnetic field direction , demonstrating strong dipolar interactions  @xcite .",
    "second , we observe a change of ellipticity after @xmath71 .",
    "this is a consequence of the radial implosion and subsequent explosion ( a stable , cigar - shaped dipolar condensate does not invert its ellipticity during the free expansion  @xcite ) .",
    "third , we observe a splitting of the condensate in axial direction as in figure [ fig : not - collpased - state ] , but now after @xmath72 . for longer holding times",
    "the splitting becomes more prominent , but the dynamics is already completed after half a trapping period .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig:5 - 50 - 0collapse_pics ]  ( d ) .",
    "the remnant atom number @xmath73 drops from @xmath74 to @xmath75 within this time scale .",
    "note that , for this figure ( and only this one ) , the simulation results agree better with the data when performed with @xmath76 ( the results shown in figure  [ fig:5 - 50 - 0collapse_pics ] are for this value of @xmath31 ) .",
    "this slight discrepancy is most probably due to a slow drift of the magnetic field that occurred between the data acquisition and the calibration of the scattering length ( the calibration procedure , described in details in  @xcite , requires the accumulation of a large quantity of data ) .",
    "as discussed , different trap geometries are expected to result in different collapse dynamics .",
    "so figures  [ fig : not - collpased - state ] and [ fig:5 - 50 - 0collapse_pics ] have to be compared to the time evolution of an almost spherical and a pancake - shaped trap . while the collapse in an almost spherical trap is published in  @xcite , we present the pancake - shaped trap in figure  [ fig:3 - 0 - 84collapse_pics ] .     in a pancake - shaped trap , which corresponds to trap - frequencies @xmath77  hz , trap ratio @xmath78 and radial period @xmath79  ms .",

    "the pancake - shaped trap is formed by superimposing two additional lattice beams onto a condensate , which was produced in the crossed dipole trap , see figure  [ fig : exp_setup ] .",
    "depending on the non - stabilized relative phase of the two lattice beams , it is in principle possible that the condensate splits into two .",
    "practically , we have never observed interference fringes , even at expansion times long enough , so that the fringe spacing @xmath85 was larger than our @xmath86 m resolution limit . switching off the trapping potential immediately after finishing the magnetic field ramp results in a very elongated condensate , in agreement with the simulations ( figure  [ fig:3 - 0 - 84collapse_pics ] ) .    the cylindrical symmetry of the pancake - shaped trap allows us to recover the three - dimensional density distribution @xmath87 from the two - dimensional absorption image @xmath88",
    ". figure  [ fig:3 - 0 - 84collapse_pics ]  ( d ) and ( e ) show isodensity surfaces for two different densities obtained from the inverse abel transformation  @xcite @xmath89 for @xmath90  ms , where @xmath91 is the bessel function of the first kind . as in the almost spherical trap  @xcite ,",
    "the collapsed cloud exhibits a symmetry .",
    "while the isodensity surface for `` high '' densities contains a central disc and two separated `` blobs '' along the symmetry axis , the three parts merge for `` low '' densities .",
    "because the abel transformation is very sensitive to noise , we can not extract in a reliable way the kinetic energy released during the collapse from our images .",
    "by analyzing the collapse of condensates confined in different trap geometries , we showed that the survival density pattern exhibits two parts : one part , which is well described by a thermal cloud and a second part , which , due to its high optical density , we interpreted as a remnant condensate  @xcite . in order to confirm this interpretation",
    ", we checked the coherence of interfering condensates in the case of pancake - shaped traps .",
    "in the pancake - shaped trap , @xmath77  hz . the lower graphs show the @xmath92-integrated column densities @xmath93 ( time - of - flight @xmath94  ms , field of view @xmath95m@xmath36 ) . ]    for that purpose , we produce several condensates by superimposing the two beams for the optical lattice _ before _ finishing the evaporation to reach quantum degeneracy . here",
    "the extension of the cloud is still large enough , so that the atoms occupy three to five adjacent lattice sites . the exact number of occupied sites changes from shot to shot , depending on the relative phase of the two lattice beams , which are not actively stabilized .",
    "after condensing , the becs on different lattice sites have random phases with respect to each another .",
    "the single particle tunneling rate is vanishingly small ( @xmath96s ) , so that no phase coherence between adjacent sites is built up on the time scale of the experiment .",
    "it is known  @xcite that the interference fringes are not washed out if few independent condensates interfere instead of only two .",
    "taking the same trap geometry as in figure  [ fig:3 - 0 - 84collapse_pics ] , but extending the time - of - flight to 18  ms , we obtain the interference patterns shown in figure  [ fig : interferences ] .",
    "as expected , the absolute position of the interference fringes changes from shot to shot , but they can be clearly seen on each image .    while for holding times shorter than @xmath97  ms or longer than @xmath98  ms interference fringes with a high contrast are visible , we observe no interference fringes at the center of the two clouds for @xmath99  ms .",
    "a possible interpretation is as follows : for @xmath100  ms _ no _ collapse occurs and the observed fringes are similar to those of two point sources . for @xmath101",
    "ms and @xmath102  ms the condensates do collapse , but this happens during the time - of - flight and _ after _ the clouds overlapped : e.g.  for @xmath84  ms the condensates start to overlap for @xmath103  ms , but the collapse happens at @xmath104  ms .",
    "probably this induces a complicated phase distribution in each of the condensate and integration over the line of sight washes out the interference fringes . on the other hand ,",
    "if the collapse happens in - trap ( e.g. for @xmath105  ms ) the fringes are formed by the remnant condensates .",
    "again we recover the fringes as if the atoms would belong to two coherent point sources .",
    "we have investigated theoretically and experimentally the collapse dynamics of dipolar condensates in prolate and oblate harmonic trapping potentials . as expected ,",
    "the collapse dynamics depends on the trap geometry , although the qualitative behavior is similar for different traps .",
    "the simulations containing no adjustable parameter reproduce the experimental results well . by simultaneously inducing a collapse in several condensates and",
    "let them interfere , we showed that the collapsed cloud contains a coherent remnant condensate .",
    "a clear direction of further studies is to use the interferometric technique of section  [ sec : testing the coherence of the collapsed cloud ] to obtain experimental evidence for the vortex rings predicted in  @xcite .",
    "the contrast of the interference fringes is not high enough to support their evidence yet .",
    "an other interesting extension is the study of two - dimensional solitons  @xcite , which are expected to appear just above the instability threshold .",
