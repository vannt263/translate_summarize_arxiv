    "trivalent graphs ( also known as cubic graphs ) form an extensively studied class of graphs . among them , the petersen graph is one of the most important finite graphs , constructible in many ways , and is a minimal counter - example for many conjectures in graph theory .",
    "the petersen graph is the initial member of a family of graphs @xmath16 , known today as _",
    "generalized petersen graphs _ , which have similar constructions .",
    "generalized petersen graphs were first introduced by coxeter @xcite in 1950 , and were named in 1969 by watkins @xcite .    a standard visualization of a generalized petersen graph consists of two types of vertices : half of them belong to an outer rim , and the other half belong to an inner rim ; and there are three types of edges : those in the outer rim , those in the inner rim , and the ` spokes ' , which form a @xmath17-factor between the inner rim and the outer rim .",
    "the outer rim is always a cycle , while the inner rim may consist of several isomorphic cycles .",
    "a generalized petersen graph @xmath16 is given by two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath18 , where @xmath1 is the number of vertices in each rim , and @xmath18 is the ` span ' of the inner rim ( which is the distance on the outer rim between the neighbours of two adjacent vertices on the inner rim ) .    the family @xmath16 contains some very important graphs . among others of particular interest",
    "are the @xmath1-prism @xmath19 , the drer graph @xmath20 , the mbius - kantor graph @xmath21 , the dodecahedron @xmath22 , the desargues graph @xmath23 , the nauru graph @xmath24 , and of course the petersen graph itself , which is @xmath25 .",
    "generalized petersen graphs possess a number of interesting properties .",
    "for example , @xmath16 is vertex - transitive if and only if either @xmath26 and @xmath27 , or @xmath28 mod @xmath29 @xcite , and a cayley graph if and only if @xmath30 mod @xmath29 @xcite , and arc - transitive only in the following seven cases : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 or @xmath37 @xcite .    if we want to maintain the symmetry between the two rims , then another parameter has to be introduced , allowing the span on the outer rim to be different from 1 .",
    "this gives the definition of an _",
    "@xmath38-graph_.    the family of @xmath38-graphs was introduced in 1988 in the foster census @xcite . for some time this family failed to attract the attention of many researchers , possibly due to the fact that among all @xmath38-graphs , the only ones that are vertex - transitive are the generalized petersen graphs @xcite",
    "still , necessary and sufficient conditions for testing whether or not two @xmath38-graphs are isomorphic were determined in @xcite , and these were used to enumerate all @xmath38-graphs in @xcite .",
    "also in @xcite it was shown that all generalized petersen graphs are unit - distance graphs , by representing them as isomorphic @xmath38-graphs .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite it was shown that automorphism group of a connected @xmath38-graph @xmath39 that is not a generalized petersen graph is either dihedral or a group with presentation @xmath40 for some @xmath41 , and that among all @xmath38-graphs , only the generalized petersen graphs can be vertex - transitive or edge - transitive .    in this paper",
    "we further generalize both of these families of graphs , and call them _ generalized i - graphs _ , or simply _",
    "@xmath0-graphs_. we determine the group of automorphisms of any @xmath0-graph .",
    "moreover , we completely characterize the edge - transitive , vertex - transitive and cayley graphs , among the class of @xmath0-graphs .    at the end of the paper",
    "we briefly discuss the problem of unit - distance realizations of @xmath0-graphs .",
    "this problem has been solved for @xmath38-graphs in @xcite .",
    "we found a remarkable new example of a 4-valent unit - distance graph , namely @xmath15 , which is a cayley graph on 21 vertices for the group @xmath42 .",
    "let us note that ours is not the only possible generalization .",
    "for instance , see @xcite for another approach , which is not much different from ours .",
    "the basic difference is that our approach uses complete graphs , while the approach by lovrei - sarain , pacco and previtali in @xcite uses cycles ; their construction coincides with ours for @xmath43 , but not for larger @xmath44 .",
    "we acknowledge the use of magma @xcite in constructing and analysing examples of @xmath0-graphs , and helping us to see patterns and test conjectures that led to many of the observations made and proved in this paper .",
    "for positive integers @xmath1 and @xmath44 with @xmath45 , let @xmath46 be any sequence of integers such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 , for @xmath49 .",

    "these @xmath58 automorphisms are all of type ( 1 ) , and all of them respect the fundamental edge - partition of @xmath54 .",
    "next , if two of the members of the multiset @xmath59 are equal , say @xmath60 for @xmath61 , then we have an automorphism @xmath62 that exchanges two cycles of layers @xmath63 and @xmath64 , but preserves every spoke .",

    "we will show that if the @xmath0-graph @xmath54 is connected , then the automorphisms described above and their products give all of the automorphisms of @xmath54 that respect the fundamental edge - partition .    for this",
