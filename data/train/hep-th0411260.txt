    "closed time - like curves , or `` time machines '' pose an intriguing puzzle in theoretical physics .",
    "while generally considered to be unphysical ( including by this author ) , they are common in solutions of general relativity .",
    "the standard practice in the field has usually been to simply discard such solutions .    in recent years",
    "quite a few solutions of supergravity were found that resemble gdel s universe @xcite and are highly supersymmetric @xcite .",
    "this led to a small industry of finding more such solutions , and there were some proposals on how string theory may deal with spaces suffering from this pathology @xcite .",
    "given that string theory incorporates general relativity with the rest of physics , including quantum mechanics , it seems like the correct laboratory to address the issue of time machines .",
    "so the question we address here is whether those spaces are correct solutions of string theory , or is there a mechanism in string theory that changes those metrics in a way that removes the pathology .",
    "the main claim is that , in the few examples studied , those supergravity solutions are _ not _ legitimate solutions of string theory .",
    "this is demonstrated by considering certain d - brane objects ( supertubes @xcite ) in these background .",
    "those supertubes may be taken as the building blocks of those geometries , and their dynamics cease to make sense when their compact direction wraps a closed time - like curve . in a close analogy with the enhanon mechanism @xcite we conclude that the supertubes go into a new phase before hitting the closed time - like curves . in that phase",
    "they delocalize and form a domain wall . across the domain wall",
    "the metric is non - differentiable , so the original metrics , which are analytic , and their time machines are just the naive continuation of the metric ignoring the domain walls .",
    "these notes are a summary of a talk given at the rtn meeting in kolymbari , crete , september 2004 .",
    "more details and a full list of references can be found in the original papers @xcite .",
    "our starting point is a family of metrics that solve the equations of motion of type iia supergravity @xcite @xmath0 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are harmonic functions in the eight @xmath3 directions and @xmath4 is a one - form satisfying the maxwell equation . from the harmonic functions we can see that these metrics describe a collection of fundamental strings stretched in the @xmath5 direction as well as d0-branes . for appropriate values of the one - form , @xmath4 , the metric will carry angular momentum and the three - form potential in the ramond - ramond sector indicates the existence of a d2-brane .",
    "those are exactly the ingredients that make up supertubes @xcite , and indeed this is the supergravity description of those objects .    let us consider two examples of metrics of this class .",
    "of the eight directions labeled by @xmath3 above we use radial coordinates in the subspace spanned by @xmath6 , and cartesian coordinates in the other four .",
    "the radial coordinate is @xmath7 and the tree euler angles on @xmath8 are @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . throughout we will use the left one - forms @xmath12 in terms of which",
    "the metric on @xmath8 is @xmath13    the first solution is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are constants .",
    "this metric was first described in @xcite , and is one of the large class of gdel like solutions of supergravity .",
    "while the general metric of the class ( [ supertube ] ) preserves eight supersymmetries , this specific ansatz preserves 20 . to study the causal structure of this space it s instructive to look at the angular components of the metric @xmath18\\,.\\ ] ] thus for radii @xmath19",
    "there are closed time - like curves , given by the integral curves of the vector field @xmath20 dual to @xmath21 , or the hopf fibres .",
    "the second example is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are constants .",
    "these harmonic functions indicate a source localized at the origin of this @xmath26 and smeared in the transverse @xmath26 .",
    "this metric is the type iia dual of the two charge black hole of type iib , where the charges are usually of d1 and d5-branes . here",
    "the three constants correspond to the fundamental string charge , the d0-brane charge density and angular momentum respectively .",
    "again we want to look at the angular part of the metric @xmath27\\,.\\ ] ] so now there will be closed time - like curves for very small radii , @xmath28 . for large charges",
    "this simplifies to @xmath29 .    of those two examples the second one is asymptotically flat and",
    "the problem of closed time - like curves arises only near the origin . in the case of gdel",
    "there was no problem near the origin , but at large radii the space does not make sense .",
    "this suggests the possibility of patching the two metrics ; replacing the singular center of the black hole with a piece of the gdel space .",
    "this can be done for any radius @xmath30 and the metric will be continuous provided we take the constants @xmath31",
    "we chose the constants describing the interior geometry such that the metric will be continuous , but it is not differentiable at the interface , indicating the existence of a source at @xmath30 .",
    "it is easy to see what the source is , either by using the israel matching conditions @xcite , or just by gauss s law .",
    "the gdel space solves the vacuum equations , while the black hole carries charges . therefore the charges associated with the black hole are now located at the domain wall .",
    "so at @xmath30 we have a domain wall that has @xmath24 d0-brane density , @xmath23 fundamental strings as well as @xmath25 units of angular momentum . for the d0-branes and fundamental strings to carry angular momentum they have to form a bound state , a supertube @xcite .",
    "the simplest description of this composite object is as a d2-brane extended in the @xmath32 and @xmath5 directions and wrapping the hopf fibres of the @xmath8 . to get the domain wall we have to smear the source along all the transverse directions : the @xmath33 base of the fiber and the transverse @xmath26 .",
    "we have not specified yet the radius of the domain wall , @xmath34 , and for certain choices the metric will still include closed time - like curves .",
    "in fact since the source is made up of supertubes there are a few restrictions .",
    "first the radius of the supertube is related to the charges it carries by @xmath35 .",
    "in addition there is a bound on the angular momentum @xmath36 .",
    "this is enough to guarantee that there are no closed time - like curves .",
    "the analysis so far indicates that if we assume that the source of the black - hole is not singular and localized at the origin it will be made of supertubes who will have a radius @xmath37 that will prevent the appearance of closed time - like curves .",
    "but is there a preferred radius ?    to answer that question we look at this background from the point of view of the supertubes themselves .",
    "i.e we probe the metric with another supertube .",
    "as mentioned , a supertube is best described as a d2-brane , and the fact that it carries string charge is manifested by an electric field @xmath38 and the d0-brane charge density is proportional to the magnetic field @xmath39 .    at low energies the dynamics of the supertube",
    "will be best described by a non - commutative field theory with open string metric @xmath40 and non - commutativity parameters @xmath41 calculated from the closed string metric @xmath42 , the pullback of the neveu - schwarz 2-form @xmath43 and the world - volume field strength @xmath44 and given by @xcite ( the lines and columns correspond to the @xmath32 , @xmath11 and @xmath5 directions ) @xmath45 where @xmath46    slow rigid motion at velocity @xmath47 of the supertube in the transverse directions is governed by an action with kinetic term @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the metric on moduli space .",
    "this quantity is positive if the supertube wraps a space - like curve , but for a certain choice of @xmath39 will be negative when wrapping a closed time - like curve , or zero when wrapping a closed null curve .",
    "this behavior is very similar to the enhanon mechanism @xcite , where the metric on the moduli space of a d6-brane wrapping a @xmath50 surface vanishes at a finite radius .",
    "there it was interpreted as a sign that the brane can not continue further in to smaller radii , and instead goes into a new phase , where a @xmath51 gauge symmetry is enhanced to @xmath52 .",
    "we wish to apply the same reasoning to the case at hand .",
    "the parameter @xmath53 corresponds to the inertial mass of the supertube for motion in the transverse directions . at the radius where",
    "@xmath54 there could be big fluctuations in those directions , and the description of the supertubes as localized objects breaks down .",
    "the gauge theory describing them should enter new phase and the supertubes are naturally smeared into the domain wall .",
    "this calculation of the moduli space metric is based on the supergravity solution but we can trust it due to the high degree of supersymmetry , the supertubes preserve eight supercharges in this background .",
    "it would be very interesting to understand the new phase of the non - commutative field theory in which the supertubes are delocalized , but until we have this description we can trust the results from supergravity .",
    "the preceding discussion summarizes the main claim in @xcite , that supertube naturally form domain walls to shield against the creation of closed time - like curves in those backgrounds .",
    "another example studied there is the case of the bmpv black hole @xcite , or its type iia dual , which carries three charges , of d0 and d4-branes and fundamental strings",
    ".    the same kind of domain wall geometry can be constructed in that example , where from the outside it looks like the bmpv black hole . but inside ( behind the cauchy horizon ) the metric is replaced by a certain gdel - like space .",
    "this construction was also found independently by gimon and hoava @xcite . the necessary source for making up the domain wall in this case would be a bound state of the three objects whose",
    "charges are carried by the black hole .",
    "such a three - charge generalization of the supertube was indeed found by bena and kraus @xcite .",
    "since those objects preserve only four supercharges the moduli space may be corrected by quantum effects .",
    "so an argument similar to the one above would not be rigorous .",
    "still we find it likely that the general picture will still hold , and those objects will experience an enhanon like phenomenon and form the appropriate domain wall .",
    "in the example studied here both spaces , the gdel - like metric and the two - charge black hole , had closed time - like curves .",
    "but we argued that neither space is a complete solution of string theory , and the correct solution includes a domain wall that patches those two metrics together .",
    "thus each of these spaces could be considered the wrong analytical continuation of a legitimate solution , ignoring the domain wall .",
    "such a mechanism is a possible solution to many other metrics that have closed time - like curves .",
    "locally those solutions are usually perfectly good , and problems arise only when extending the solutions to global metrics .",
    "such continuations are unique assuming the metric is analytic , which was _ not _ the case here .",
    "domain walls are a natural way to break analyticity and thus averting this global problem .",
    "another beautiful example where a similar mechanism is at play was found by israel @xcite . in that case",
    "a gdel - like deformation of @xmath55 develops closed time - like curves , but those are naturally cured after the inclusion of a domain wall made of large fundamental strings .",
    "it would be very interesting to see how general this mechanism is .",
