    "the high precision of experiments at past , present and future particle colliders ( lep , hera , tevatron , lhc , @xmath1 linear colliders ) demands a corresponding precision in theoretical predictions . as for perturbative qcd predictions , this means calculations beyond the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the strong coupling @xmath2 .",
    "recent years have witnessed much progress in this field . in particular ,",
    "a great deal of work has been devoted to study the properties of qcd scattering amplitudes in the infrared ( soft and collinear ) region  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the understanding of the infrared singular behaviour of qcd amplitudes is a prerequisite for the evaluation of infrared - finite cross sections ( and , more generally , infrared- and collinear - safe qcd observables ) at higher orders in perturbation theory .",
    "moreover , the information on the infrared properties of the amplitudes can be exploited to compute large ( logarithmically enhanced ) perturbative terms and to resum them to all perturbative orders  @xcite .",
    "those investigations are also valuable for improving the physics content of monte carlo event generators ( see e.g. ref .",
    "in addition , these studies prove to be useful even beyond the strict qcd context , and can provide hints on the structure of highly symmetric gauge theories at infinite orders in the perturbative expansion ( e.g. n=4 super - yang - mills , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "another important application is the calculation of the altarelli ",
    "parisi ( ap ) kernels , that control the scale evolution of parton densities and fragmentation functions .",
    "the calculation of the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) kernels has been completed very recently  @xcite .",
    "collinear factorization at the amplitude level ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : collinear ] ) can be used  @xcite as an alternative and independent method to perform that calculation . to this purpose , the one - loop triple collinear splitting  @xcite ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : triple ] ) is one of the necessary ingredients .",
    "two other ingredients are the tree - level quadruple collinear splitting  @xcite and the two - loop double collinear splitting  @xcite .",
    "besides increasing the quantitative precision of the theoretical calculations , the evaluation of higher - order contributions can reveal qualitatively new quantum effects .",
    "an interesting example is the perturbative generation of charge asymmetries in the nucleon s sea  @xcite ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : asym ] ) , which arises from the nnlo evolution of parton densities .",
    "we consider a generic scattering process involving final - state qcd partons ( massless quarks and gluons ) of flavour @xmath3 and momenta @xmath4 , which is described by the matrix element @xmath5 ; the external legs are on shell @xmath6 and have physical spin polarizations . up to one - loop order , one can write [ loopex ] = ( ) ^q  , where the overall power @xmath7 is integer .",
    "the one - loop amplitude @xmath8 contains ultraviolet and infrared singularities that are regularized by using dimensional regularization in @xmath9 space - time dimensions ( @xmath10 is the dimensional - regularization scale ) .",
    "the multiple collinear limit is approached when the momenta @xmath11 of @xmath12 partons become parallel . in this limit all the particle subenergies @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , are of the same order and vanish simultaneously , and the matrix element @xmath15 becomes singular . at the tree level , the dominant singular behaviour is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 generically denotes a two - particle subenergy @xmath18 , or a three - particle subenergy @xmath19 , and so forth . at one - loop order , this singular behaviour",
    "is simply modified by scaling violation , @xmath20 .",
    "the dominant singular behaviour is captured by universal ( process - independent ) factorization formulae , that are usually presented upon decomposition in colour subamplitudes  @xcite@xcite .",
    "collinear factorization is nonetheless valid directly in colour space  @xcite .",
    "the colour - space factorization formulae for the multiple collinear limit of the tree - level and one - loop amplitudes @xmath21 and @xmath8 are : [ facttree ] & & + & & _ a_1  a_m^(0)(p_1,  ,p_m )  , [ factone ] & & + & & _ a_1  a_m^(1)(p_1,  ,p_m ) + + & & _ a_1  a_m^(0)(p_1,  ,p_m )  .",
    "these factorization formulae are valid in any number @xmath22 of space - time dimensions .",
    "the only approximation involved on the right - hand sides amounts to neglecting terms that are less singular in the multiple collinear limit .",
    "a graphical representation of the factorization formulae is shown in figs .",
    "[ factoriza_lo ] and  [ factoriza_nlo ] . equations ( [ facttree ] ) and ( [ factone ] )",
    "relate the original matrix element ( on the left - hand side ) with @xmath23 partons ( where @xmath24 is arbitrary ) to a matrix element ( on the right - hand side ) with @xmath25 partons .",
    "the latter is obtained from the former by replacing the @xmath12 collinear partons with a single parent parton , whose momentum @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) defines the collinear direction and whose flavour @xmath28 is determined by flavour conservation in the splitting process @xmath29 .",
    "the derivation of in colour space is quite straightforward  @xcite .",
    "its one - loop extension , , follows , in particular , from colour coherence of qcd radiation  @xcite .",
    "the process dependence of the factorization formulae is entirely embodied in the matrix elements . the tree - level and one - loop factors @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which encode the singular behaviour in the multiple collinear limit , are universal ( process - independent ) .",
    "they depend on the momenta and quantum numbers ( flavour , spin , colour ) of the @xmath12 partons that arise from the collinear splitting .",
    "the _ splitting matrix _",
    "@xmath32 is a matrix in colour+spin space , acting onto the colour and spin indices of the @xmath12 collinear partons on the left and onto the colour and spin indices of the parent parton on the right .",
    "the square of the splitting matrix @xmath32 , summed over final - state colours and spins and averaged over colours and spins of the parent parton , defines the @xmath12-parton splitting function @xmath33 , which is a generalization of the customary ( i.e. with @xmath34 ) ap splitting function  @xcite .",

    "considering physical spin polarizations , the splitting matrix is calculated from the sole feynman diagrams where the parent parton emits and absorbs collinear radiation . in the case @xmath43 , one has to consider , for instance , the one - loop diagram depicted in fig .",
    "[ diagrams](a ) .",
    "our computation of @xmath37 requires the evaluation of a set of basic one - loop ( scalar and tensor ) integrals . besides the customary one - loop integrals , new integrals with additional propagators of the type @xmath45 ( @xmath7 is the loop momentum and",
    "@xmath46 is an auxiliary light - like vector ) , which come from the physical polarizations of the virtual gluons , have to be calculated .",
    "some of these integrals , which resemble those encountered in axial - gauge calculations , were evaluated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the calculation of the one - loop double collinear splitting @xmath42 .",
    "more complicated integrals ( higher - point functions ) of this type are involved in triple collinear splitting processes .",
    "we have computed ( to high orders in the @xmath38 expansion ) all the basic one - loop integrals that appear in any triple collinear splitting .",
    "these results can be applied to evaluate the one - loop splitting matrix of any splitting process @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "the explicit expressions up to @xmath48 of the splitting matrix @xmath49 and of the corresponding splitting function @xmath50 ( see fig .  [ diagrams](a ) ) are presented in ref .",
    "it is important to observe that @xmath50 has a contribution ( which is proportional to the color factor @xmath51 ) that changes sign by exchanging the momenta of the evolved quark and antiquark @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this charge asymmetry is a new quantum effect produced by the exchange of three gluons in the @xmath54-channel . when the charge asymmetry of @xmath50 is combined with the corresponding tree - level contribution ( see fig .",

    "the strange `` asymmetry '' , @xmath0 , in the densities of strange quarks and antiquarks , @xmath56 being the light - cone momentum fraction they carry , is of particular interest .",
    "since the nucleon does not carry any strangeness quantum number , the integral of the asymmetry over all values of @xmath56 has to vanish : @xmath57=0 \\ ; .\\ ] ] however , there is no symmetry that would prevent the @xmath56 dependences of the functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 from being different",
    ". therefore one can expect @xmath60 , in general .",
    "strange  antistrange asymmetries have been extensively discussed in the literature .",
    "various non - perturbative models of the nucleon structure  @xcite predict a fairly small value of the second moment of the strange  antistrange distribution , @xmath61 .",
    "a global analysis of unpolarized parton distributions  @xcite reported improvements in the data fit if the asymmetry @xmath0 is positive at high @xmath56 .",
    "however , a recent update  @xcite of this analysis reduces the asymmetry significantly .",
    "the most recent global qcd fit  @xcite finds a large uncertainty for that asymmetry and quotes a range @xmath62 .",
    "the strange asymmetry in the nucleon has become particularly relevant in view of the `` anomaly '' seen by the nutev collaboration in their measurement of the weinberg angle  @xcite .",
    "the anomaly could be partly explained  @xcite by a positive value of the second moment @xmath63 .",
    "the discussion reported so far regards strange  antistrange asymmetries that are generated by non - perturbative mechanisms .",
    "then , because of the customary scaling violation , the asymmetry becomes dependent on the hard - scattering scale @xmath64 at which the nucleon is probed .",
    "perturbative qcd alone , however , definitely predicts a non - vanishing and @xmath64-dependent value of the strange  antistrange asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "the effect arises because at nnlo in perturbation theory the probability of the inclusive collinear splitting ( evolution ) @xmath65 becomes different from that of @xmath66 , and because the nucleon has @xmath67 and @xmath68 valence densities .",
    "owing to charge conjugation invariance and flavour symmetry of qcd , the ap kernels that control the parton evolution of quark  antiquark asymmetries can be written as ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) p_q_i q_j - p_q_i    & = & _ ij p^(- ) + ( p_qq^-p_q|q^ ) .",
    "the ap kernels @xmath69 and @xmath70 describe splittings in which the flavor of the quark changes , and @xmath71 starting from nnlo @xcite .",
    "in particular , as discussed at the end of sect .",
    "[ sec : triple ] , @xmath72 , because of the charge asymmetry produced by quantum effects at order @xmath73 . the explicit expression of @xmath74 is now available thanks to the recent computation by moch , vermaseren and vogt  @xcite .",
    "the solution of the ap equations for the evolution ( between the scales @xmath75 and @xmath64 ) of the @xmath76-moment , @xmath77 , of the strange - quark asymmetry reads  @xcite [ sasym ] & & ( s - |s ) _",
    "n(q^2)= u_n(q , q_0 )  , where @xmath78 is the valence density of the nucleon , @xmath79 is the evolution operator controlled by @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is proportional to the nnlo kernel @xmath74  @xcite . at lo and nlo , @xmath82 , and",
    "thus any asymmetry can only be produced by a corresponding asymmetry at the scale @xmath75 .",
    "starting from nnlo , the degeneracy of @xmath69 and @xmath70 is removed , and perturbative qcd necessarily predicts a non - vanishing @xmath83 asymmetry driven by the valence density .",
    "predictions for @xmath84 based on have been presented in ref .",
    "the asymmetry , @xmath83 , is set to zero at a given low scale @xmath75 , and then evolved upwards .",
    "the generated asymmetry is fairly sizable and turns out to be positive at small @xmath56 and negative at large @xmath56 .",
    "using @xmath85  gev ( as in the ` radiative ' parton model analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a negative second moment is found : @xmath86 the analysis has also be extended  @xcite to predict the asymmetries of heavy flavours @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
