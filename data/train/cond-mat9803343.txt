    "in this paper we study how the choice of a particular hamiltonian is responsible for the distribution pattern of sites sensitive to point mutations in a heteropolymeric chain .    as shown in @xcite using a very simple model @xcite , in every optimized @xcite sequence there are sites at which point mutations are likely to cause misfolding of the native state ( we call them hot sites ) , while there are other sites at which point mutations have no relevant thermodynamic effect ( cold sites ) , and we call intermediate sites warm. as known from both experimental @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite usually proteins are made of few hot sites while the majority of the other sites are cold . because of the thermodynamic importance of the hot sites it is of general interest to investigate the principles guiding their positioning along the protein chain .",
    "the model used in this work describes the polymer as a chain of beads in a cubic lattice , interacting through the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the contact energy between the two residues situated on the @xmath2th and @xmath3th positions , @xmath4 is the length of the chain and @xmath5 has the value @xmath6 if the @xmath2th and @xmath3th are nearest neighbors and zero if not .    in literature ,",
    "different choices of the matrix @xmath1 have been used .",
    "the results of ref . @xcite have been found with a matrix @xcite whose elements are distributed according to a gaussian , with average @xmath7 and standard deviation @xmath8 ( in units of @xmath9 ) . with these matrix elements , for every target structure it is possible to select sequences whose native state is unique , stable and kinetically accessible @xcite .",
    "it has been found that a reliable condition for a site to be cold or hot is intimately connected to the change in the native state energy caused by a point mutation : the bigger is this difference , the more probable for this site to be a hot site . hot sites of such sequences are mainly in the bulk sites of the native conformation , but can be on the surface as well , while some bulk sites can be rather insensitive to mutations ( fig.[fig1]a ) .",
    "repeating the same calculations with a random  generated , gaussian  distributed set of interaction energies , we have observed similar distribution patterns for hot and cold sites ( fig.[fig1]b ) .",
    "another choice of the interaction matrix can be made to take into account explicitly the hydrophobic effect encountered in real proteins .",
    "the simplest way is to choose the matrix @xmath1 to be composed of only three different elements , namely @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "these elements are responsible for the interaction between hydrophobic ( h ) and polar ( p ) residues .",
    "unfortunately it was found @xcite that for a given target structure and hp interaction matrix it is difficult to construct optimal sequences for which this target structure would be kinetically accessible . as a rule , the optimization of the sequence puts h  residues in the bulk sites ( the sites with the greatest number of nearest  neighbors ) , and every substitution of an h residue with a p residue causes the chain misfolding ( see figs . 2 and 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    on the way between the random matrix and the highly regular hp interaction model stands the matrix deduces by miyazawa and jernigan in @xcite .",
    "this matrix contains @xmath14 different elements which can still be grouped into @xmath15 big blocks , according to their hydrophobicity . in this case",
    "it is possible to find sequences for which the native state is both stabile and kinetically accessible .",
    "it was also found that , as in the situation with only two kinds of residues , hot sites are invariably the sites with the highest number of contacts ( bulk sites , fig .",
    "[ fig1]d ) .",
    "the question again is what are the principles guiding the positioning of hot sites along the protein chain and how a particular form of the interaction matrix can influence the distribution pattern of hot and cold mutation sites .",
    "this paper is organized as following . in the next section",
    "we will present a convenient representation of an interaction matrix as a function of mixing parameter @xmath16 .",
    "variation of the mixing parameter will correspond to a change from highly ordered hp like interaction matrix at @xmath17 to highly nonlinear matrix at non - zero values of mixing parameter .",
    "a distribution pattern of cold and hot sites will be investigated with the use of these interaction matrices .",
    "next we will address the same question by introducing a parameter of randomness @xmath18 which would allow us to investigate the mutation sites distribution pattern with highly ordered hp like interaction matrix at @xmath19 and random gaussian interaction matrix at large @xmath18 .",
    "conclusions will be drawn at the end .",
    "in the work by lee , tang and wingreen @xcite a particular interesting parameterization of semi  experimental mj matrix @xcite was introduced , as a consequence of its regularity . in their work",
    "it was shown that elements of the mj interaction matrix can be very nicely fitted as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is ascribed to a monomer of kind @xmath22 and @xmath16 is a constant .",
    "this parameterization involves @xmath23 parameters , instead of @xmath14 parameters of the mj matrix , each specifying the strength of a particular residue . using this parameterization",
    "we have found that , for the best fit , all @xmath21 are negative and range from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , while @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , it has been pointed out that the origin of the additive term is due to the hydrophobic effect , while the second order term is responsible for the segregation of dissimilar residues .    using this parameterization ,",
    "we can write the hamiltonian of the chain in a form @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 have dimensions equal to the number of monomers in the chain . the @xmath2th coordinate of @xmath28 is the number of nearest neighbors for the @xmath2th monomer and the @xmath2th coordinate of @xmath29 specifies the strength of the residue in the @xmath2th site .",
    "@xmath30 is the contact matrix for a given conformation . in the above reference",
    "it has been shown that the hamiltonian ( [ paramh ] ) fits very well the original mj hamiltonian and , what is more precious , it is very convenient to handle analytically .",
    "one of the problems that can be solved easily using the above hamiltonian is , given a target structure ( @xmath30 matrix and @xmath28 ) and the composition of the chain in term of residues , to find the sequence which minimize the energy @xcite .",
    "particularly , using the fact that the second order term is usually @xmath31 times smaller than the first order term , a first order approximation solution can be found minimizing only the solvent exclusion term . the straightforward way is to choose a sequence so that the vectors @xmath29 and @xmath28 are as anti  parallel as possible , keeping the constraint of a fixed number of different kinds of monomers .",
    "knowing that all components of @xmath29 are negative while all components of @xmath28 are positive , it is necessary to put the residues with the most negative value of @xmath32 in the sites of the target structure with the largest number of nearest  neighbors .",
    "the effect is , roughly speaking , to put hydrophobic residues ( i.e. low @xmath32 ) inside the structure while keeping hydrophilic ones ( high @xmath32 ) on the surface .",
    "the second order term in the hamiltonian ( [ paramh ] ) is responsible for a fine tuning of residue distribution , mostly inside the hydrophobic / hydrophilic regions , and causes a further decrease of the sequence energy .",
    "according to @xcite , we label each mutation with the difference of the native state energy of the wild  type sequence and of the mutated sequence @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the interaction element associated with the wild  type sequence and @xmath35 with a mutated sequence .",
    "it has been shown that the information about the thermodynamic features of the mutated sequence is mostly contained in the value of @xmath36 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the energetic effects of mutations in a given site @xmath2 are studied introducing the average @xmath36 over the @xmath37 possible mutations in this site , @xmath38 for optimized sequences there are few sites ( up to @xmath39 ) where @xmath40 is large ( @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the gap between the native state and the random conformations energy @xcite ) , while for the others @xmath40 is much lower .",
    "we call the former sites hot and the latter cold. if a mutation occurs in a hot site , there is a high probability that it fills the gap , eliminating the feature of design and causing misfolding of the chain .    for random interaction matrices whose elements have gaussian distribution , the behavior of hot sites is the same as indicated in ref .",
    "hot sites can be both in the bulk and on the surface of the native configuration ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) with dominance of hot sites in the bulk .",
    "on the other hand , in a model with only two kinds of residues ( h and p ) , the optimization of the sequence puts h residues in the sites with the highest number of nearest neighbors . in this case",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , every site containing a h residue is a hot site .",
    "we are now interested in studying the pattern of hot sites in a model where the interaction matrix contains both features of hydrophobic - hydrophilic separation and randomness or complicated non  linearity .",
    "to investigate the behavior of @xmath43 we use the parameterized hamiltonian ( [ paramh ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that , for a wild  type sequence characterized by @xmath29 @xmath44 where @xmath45 , is the average of the values @xmath21 corresponding to the @xmath23 monomers different from the wild  type . with this assumption",
    "we have found @xmath46 .",
    "we shell consider first the case @xmath17 , which is exactly solvable , and then the consequences of the non - linear term introduced via non  zero mixing parameter @xmath16 ..      in the case @xmath17 the hamiltonian contains only the solvent exclusion term @xmath47 . as we discussed earlier , optimization of the sequence , given a structure , consists in putting the most hydrophobic residues into the sites with the greatest number of contacts , keeping with the constraint of fixed number of different residues ,",
    "so that @xmath48    for short chains and 20 letter code used in the model with @xmath17 the optimization procedure described above works reasonably good in constructing optimal sequences while for longer chains it seems that the model is not adequate to ensure a single ground state or a ground state well  separated from the other states",
    ". nevertheless , the case @xmath17 is a good starting point to investigate the role of the different terms of hamiltonian ( [ paramh ] ) .    in this case equation ( [ site ] ) can be written as @xmath49 defining @xmath50 and substituting ( [ opt ] ) in ( [ b0 ] ) as an approximation for an optimal sequence , we obtain @xmath51 for typical values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 then @xmath54 the shape of this function is plotted in fig .",
    "it is interesting to compare the value @xmath43 for the optimized sequence with the one for a random sequence .",
    "we will identify , in the spirit of random energy model @xcite , hot sites ( as defined in sect .",
    "iii ) with those sites in which the average impact of mutations is greater than for a random sequence .",
    "we define a sequence to be random if there is no correlation between the strength @xmath32 at a given site , and its number of nearest neighbors @xmath55 , so that @xmath56 where @xmath57 ranges between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the values that @xmath58 can assume are comprised between the two straight lines plotted in fig.[fig2]a . while the dependence of @xmath43 for the random sequence is linear , for a selected sequence it is quadratic . in the case of the selected sequence the quadratic behavior of the mutation energy versus",
    "the number of closest nearest neighbors induces a sharp distinction between bulk sites ( @xmath59 ) and surface sites . as clear form ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) , all bulk sites are hot , while surface sites are cold. as consequence , hot sites have a certain degree of symmetry in target structures , i.e. no one of the sites with the same number of nearest neighbors is privileged to the others .",
    "the map of the hot and cold sites for a hamiltonian @xmath17 and a 36 monomer target structure is presented on ( fig . [ fig1]c ) .      if @xmath16 is not zero , but still small in absolute values , it is possible to minimize the energy of the sequence in two steps , first minimizing @xmath61 and finding an initial trial optimal sequence @xmath62 , and then re - minimizing the same @xmath63 with an effective @xmath64 . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite this procedure is quite reliable for small @xmath16 .    using the same approximation ( [ opt ] ) as in the previous section for @xmath62 one",
    "finds @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the number of nearest neighbors of the nearest neighbors of site @xmath2 and can assume values in the range @xmath67 .",
    "the expression of @xmath68 , then , takes into account , through the value of @xmath69 , sites lying further than the nearest neighbors of @xmath2 . as consequence of this",
    ", we can observe ( fig . [",
    "fig2]b ) a broadening of the range of values that @xmath68 can assume for each @xmath55 ( we will refer to this broadening as energy bands in our further discussion )    from fig .",
    "( [ fig2]b ) it follows that the effect of the segregation term in ( 3 ) is to differentiate among the sites with the same number of closest nearest neighbors . as @xmath70 ,",
    "the second shell of nearest neighbors starts playing its role , thus introducing a cooperative effects in the determination of @xmath68 .",
    "this splitting of the degeneracies in the @xmath68 at @xmath71 can lead to the overlap of energy bands thus leading to the possibility of encountering a hot site on a surface and cold site in the bulk .    to summarize , from the point of view of single mutations , in the case @xmath17 the spectrum of mutations is composed by two main parts , namely mutations in bulk sites , with high value of @xmath36 , and mutations in surface sites , with @xmath36 close to zero or negative .",
    "the effect of the coupling term is to broaden the range of the possible mutation energies for the mutation sites of the same type ( bulk or surface ) mixing the energetic levels corresponding to mutations in different kind of sites .",
    "so , the symmetry of hot sites in the target structure can be broken thus allowing some hot sites to be found on surface .      to investigate how the energy bands depend upon the strength of the nonlinear contribution in the interaction matrix we have made some explicit calculations , using as target structure the @xmath72mers chain displayed on ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we have first calculated the best values of @xmath73 and @xmath16 to fit mj matrix according to eq .",
    "[ ltw ] , finding @xmath26 . using these values for @xmath73 , we varied @xmath16 in the range @xmath74 , optimizing each time the sequence with a genetic energy minimization technique .",
    "the composition has been kept fixed for all values of @xmath16 and chosen in such a way as to satisfy @xmath75 ( condition for optimal composition at @xmath17 ) . for the sake of computational convenience ,",
    "the interaction matrix elements have been rescaled to have zero average and standard deviation equal to @xmath76 .",
    "then , we have plotted the value of @xmath77 for each lattice site , as function of @xmath16 .",
    "first , we consider the case @xmath78 .",
    "the raising of different energy bands is shown in fig.[fig3]a .",
    "for @xmath79 all the bands lay into four distinct groups .",
    "the first two groups , which correspond to the sites with @xmath80 or @xmath81 , contribute to cold sites .",
    "the other two groups correspond to the sites with @xmath82 or @xmath83 defining the warm and hot sites .",
    "this situation is very similar to the case of @xmath17 , where bands do not overlap and hot sites are exclusively in the bulk .",
    "it is not surprising to find the same distribution pattern for the mj matrix ( @xmath26 ) ( fig.[fig1]d ) . and hp - like interaction matrix ( @xmath17 ) ( fig.[fig1]c ) . for @xmath84",
    "the nonlinear part of the interaction matrix starts playing its role .",
    "as was shown in the previous section the second neighbor shell contribute to the value of @xmath85 . at these values of parameter @xmath16",
    "we observe that some of the energy bands corresponding to warm ( n=3 ) and cold sites ( n=1,2 ) mix , while the bands corresponding to the hot sites stay well separated from the other bands .    in the case of @xmath86 ( fig.[fig3]b )",
    "the non - linear effect is much more dramatic .",
    "for @xmath87 all bands start mixing allowing cold sites penetrate the bulk while pushing hot sites on a surface .",
    "we can rationalise the different pattern of energy bands at @xmath78 and @xmath86 by examining the eq.[site ] and hamiltonian [ paramh ] . noticing that @xmath88 is of the order of @xmath89 we can rewrite the hamiltonian [ paramh ] in a form @xmath90 where @xmath91 contains the collective effects and @xmath92 describes a renormalized hydrophobic effect . in the case",
    "@xmath93 , @xmath94 and the interaction matrix is largely dominated by the hydrophobic effect , while the collective contribution to the hamiltonian is not strong enough to substantially mix the energy bands.    for the @xmath86 case @xmath95 and the renormalized hydrophobic effect becomes comparable or smaller than the collective term in the hamiltonian .",
    "this allows all bands to mix substantially .",
    "another interesting question which can be addressed is how our conclusions are modified by the addition of a random term in the @xmath17 hamiltonian . to study this problem ,",
    "we have chosen a hamiltonian in the form @xmath96 where @xmath97 comes from the parameterization ( [ ltw ] ) of the mj matrix with @xmath17 .",
    "the virtue of this hamiltonian is in separation in a controllable manner the hydrophobic effect due to the @xmath98 and any other non - linear effects are modeled by the random term .",
    "the values of @xmath99 are taken from a gaussian distribution with mean zero and standard deviation @xmath76 . in ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) the energy bands are shown as a function of mixing parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the overall pattern is exactly the same as discussed in the previous section for the case in which non  linear terms in the parameterization are switched on leading to the effect of band crossing thus allowing warm sites to appear on the surface and cold sites in the bulk . even in the case of band crossing",
    ", there is still a clear trend for the hot and warm sites to concentrate in the bulk of the structure .",
    "this is due to the fact that bulk sites , building the biggest number of contacts , still display the strongest response to point mutations .    in the inserts of figs.[fig3]a , b and fig.[fig4 ] shown the energy of the optimal non - mutated sequence for different values of @xmath16 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "it is possible to observe a sudden decrease in energy of the optimal sequence as @xmath16 and @xmath18 increases signifying that the addition of non - linear terms into a hamiltonian allows for a much better energy minimization .",
    "in this work we have considered how the regularity of the interaction matrix influence the distribution pattern of hot sites .",
    "it has been found that if the matrix is polarized ( dominant hydrophobic effect , @xmath100 or @xmath101 ) this distribution is very simple .",
    "all the hot sites can be found at the positions with maximum number of closest nearest neighbors ( bulk ) .",
    "with increasing importance of non - linear terms ( @xmath102,@xmath103 ) the distribution pattern changes so that the hot and warm sites can be found in places with smaller number of nearest neighbors ( surface ) while the general trend of the hot sites to fall into a bulk part of a conformation still holds .",
    "as pointed out above this can be rationalized by noticing that if mixing parameter is different than zero each site starts feeling not only its nearest neighbors but also the more distant sites .",
    "this leads to a collective nature of the interactions giving rise to a modified distribution pattern of hot sites .",
