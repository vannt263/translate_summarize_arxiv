    "lensless coherent diffractive x - ray imaging ( cdi ) has opened up a new field of high resolution structure analysis beyond the ensemble averaging of conventional x - ray diffraction @xcite .",
    "typically , lensless x - ray imaging setups are closer to diffraction experiments than to a classical microscope setup with lenses , except that they require a sufficiently coherent probing wavefront or beam as well as sufficient sampling of the diffraction pattern . in other words ,",
    "the imaging systems is essentially based on free space propagation between object and detector . depending on whether the data is recorded in the optical near - field or far - field , the propagation is modeled by the fresnel propagator or a fourier transform ( fraunhofer far - field regime ) , respectively . as in conventional diffraction",
    ", each detector pixel carries information about all object pixels .",
    "therefore , if the data is modeled in the detector plane , high spatial resolution can only be achieved in terms of the average structure .",
    "contrarily , if the data is _ inverted _ to reconstruct the object , the individual real space configuration is depicted , beyond an ensemble average ( or more precisely an average over the entire illuminated volume ) .",
    "importantly , the image formation is still very similar to a plain diffraction experiment , while the data analysis is not .",
    "data modeling for example by least - square fitting is replaced by image reconstruction .",
    "model formulation is replaced by the formulation of _ a priori _ knowledge ( constraints ) , which are required to compensate for the missing information on the phase of the diffraction field , and hence to achieve a unique solution .",
    "accordingly , the difference is brought about by the inversion of the diffraction process : by solving the inverse problem of ( non - crystallographic ) diffraction , we obtain access to the individual configuration instead of the average sizes and correlation lengths in the object . it is for this reason that iterative algorithms @xcite , being to date the engine of cdi , have received so much attention .",
    "iteratively cycling between the detector and object planes , they feed in both measured data and additional _ a priori _ information on the solution .",
    "cdi uses _ a priori _ knowledge , for example related to the object support or its optical constants ( positivity , pure phase contrast ) .",
    "diversity in the data generated by illuminating the same object pixels by different wavefronts may be exploited by ptychographic algorithms @xcite . in general , however , one is interested in finding experimental settings allowing for robust phase retrieval with least invasive constraints , dose and accumulation times . in many applications for example ,",
    "one is interested in reconstructing from single recordings , without scanning or multiple exposures . at the same time",
    ", the object may be composed of several materials , both with phase and amplitude contrast .",
    "it is therefore often of advantage to perform the imaging in the optical near - field rather than far - field . here , phase information is much more directly encoded in the diffraction pattern , by ways of interference between diffracted and reference waves .",
    "recently , improved uniqueness results have been presented for near - field imaging using the theory of entire functions @xcite .",
    "in fact , contrary to a common belief , see e.g. @xcite , measurements at only one distance are sufficient to determine both the real and the imaginary part of any compactly supported refractive index distribution .",
    "these results are much stronger than those for the fraunhofer regime , as obtained e.g.  by @xcite .",
    "loosly speaking , the near - field case can thus be expected to require less information to complement the measurements than the far - field case . in practice , however , many iterative algorithms which have been adapted to the near - field case @xcite require similar data diversity or constraints .    notwithstanding the merits of many highly performing iterative algorithms , it is therefore necessary to broaden the perspective of the phase retrieval field . here , we present iteratively regularized gauss - newton methods ( irgnm ) @xcite as an alternative approach to phase retrieval and other imaging problems . in this method , each iterate is computed to provide an optimal compromise between agreement with the measured data and additional constraints on the basis of a local linearization of contrast formation , as we discuss further below .",
    "the approach is related to the regularized gradient descent methods for phase reconstruction proposed in @xcite , but promises improved convergence owing to the newton - like solution of linearized subproblems .",
    "we apply the general irgnm framework to near - field phase contrast with x - rays , for the reasons mentioned above , and since recent progress in propagation imaging has narrowed the gap in resolution compared to cdi .",
    "in fact , using highly divergent and coherent quasi - spherical wavefronts , x - ray imaging in the optical near - field has been recently demonstrated down to 20 nm resolution @xcite .",
    "the scope of the present work is two - fold .",
    "firstly , we give a concise overview of iteratively regularized gauss - newton methods in view of x - ray imaging , summarizing and explaining recent mathematical literature in this field for an applied audience . secondly",
    ", we demonstrate the performance of this approach in solving the phase problem on the level of real state - of - the - art experimental data .",
    "in particular , we apply an irgnm approach to three - dimensional ( 3d ) imaging , i.e. we show how the method can be used to perform phase retrieval and tomographic reconstruction simultaneously .",
    "this strategy has been argued to enable improved accuracy compared to splitting the reconstruction into phase retrieval problems for each angle to recover the fields in the object plane and a subsequent inversion of the radon transform @xcite .",
    "we show that irgnm approaches offer significant flexibility in treating various experimental setups and different _ a priori _ information . in the long run , we also expect advantages owing to the fact that the noise characteristics of the data can be suitably accounted for in this framework . for the most important example of poisson data , newton - type regularization methods with kullback - leibler - type data fidelity terms have already been proposed @xcite .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : @xmath1[s2 ] introduces irgnm in view of image reconstructions problems from the principal idea to practical implementation . in @xmath1[s3 ] , the framework is applied to ( 2d ) near - field phase contrast with hard x - rays , imaging the phase shifts and absorption induced by a nano - structured test pattern . a kaczmarz - type irgnm suitable for tomographic imaging is presented in @xmath1[s4 ] and applied to resolve the structure of a colloidal micro - crystal .",

    "note that @xmath6 may depend on @xmath7 as is the case for poisson data .",
    "for many models , an explicit inversion formula for @xmath5 is not known . moreover , even if the inverse @xmath8 is available , it is often not continuous and would thus amplify errors @xmath6 by large magnitudes if applied directly to the data @xmath9 . such _",

    "nevertheless , reasonable results can often be achieved using a linearization of contrast formation , as given for instance by the contrast transfer function in electron microscopy or coherent x - ray imaging @xcite .",

    "implementing in a regularized newton - type framework corresponds to an _ all - at - once _ approach to phase contrast tomography , as phase- and tomographic reconstruction are not carried out in subsequent steps but simultaneously . in particular",
    ", this implies that tomographic correlations between images under different incident angles are incorporated already in the phase retrieval step .",
    "similarly as in coherent diffractive imaging @xcite , this has been shown to improve stability and accuracy of the reconstruction @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a numerical inversion of @xmath138 by an irgnm is not viable for high resolution data sets due to memory constraints and high computational costs of the evaluation of the radon transform .    as a remedy",
    ", we propose to solve the reconstruction problem of phase contrast tomography by a regularized newton - kaczmarz methods as presented in section [ ss2.3 ] .",
    "the tomographic setting suggests a decomposition of the forward operator @xmath143 , corresponding to small sub - data sets of diffraction patterns from only very few incident angles .",
    "each newton step then only requires evaluations of comparably small radon transforms and processing of feasible chunks of data . at the same time , tomographic consistency is exploited by directly reconstructing a three - dimensional object instead of single projections .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath144 may be chosen such that the most strongly correlated images for only slightly differing incident angles are processed simultaneously .",
    "we implement the newton - kaczmarz step for the imaging operator , using the simple parameter choice @xmath145 and @xmath146 , where @xmath38 is estimated according to section [ ss2.2 ] .",
    "firstly , this regularization imposes the current reconstruction as a strong prior for the next iteration .",
    "secondly , it also yields a favorable condition number for the linear newton steps so that cg - methods typically converge after 3 - 5 iterations .    for a proof of concept ,",
    "we consider phase contrast images of a colloidal crystal composed of @xmath147{nm}$]-sized polystyrene beads , imaged at an energy @xmath148{kev}$ ] in the experimental setup of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the tomographic data set is composed of 249 diffraction patterns of size @xmath149 acquired at a maximum photon flux of @xmath150 per pixel under incident angles @xmath132 between @xmath151 and @xmath152{^\\circ}$ ] .",
    "the raw data correction included an alignment of the tomographic projections to the common center of mass and iterative reprojections , following the approach of @xcite .",
    "the photon flux corresponds to an upper bound of @xmath153{kgy}$ ] for the absorbed dose over the total tomographic data acquisition .",
    "the flat - field corrected intensities are visualized in fig . [ fig:4]@xmath105 . in the effective geometry ,",
    "the fresnel number is @xmath154 at an effective pixel size of @xmath155{nm}$ ] .    from the fringes in the data set in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]@xmath105 as well as preliminary reconstructions , one can infer the object location in the center of the field of view .",
    "this is exploited by restricting the reconstruction to a central @xmath156 voxel cube , imposing a loose 3d - support constraint .",
    "moreover , the hydrocarbon composition of the polystyrene spheres and the photon energy allow using @xmath157 as a constraint ( non - absorbing object ) , i.e.  to reconstruct only the refractive increment @xmath136 . unfortunately , a sobolev - type regularization term would bottleneck the proposed newton - kaczmarz - scheme as the required ffts in the gramian would constitute the only @xmath158 operations in the newton updates .",
    "we therefore recur to simple @xmath33-regularization and @xmath33-data fidelity terms , corresponding to identity gramians @xmath66 in .",
    "however , positivity of @xmath136 is imposed by supplementing the kaczmarz - newton step with the penalty term in .",
    "the weights of the penalty terms are set to @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "for the initial guess , we simply choose @xmath114 .",
    "the forward operator @xmath138 is decomposed such that angular `` wedges '' of six adjacent diffraction patterns are processed simultaneously in each newton step .",
    "the number of iterations is determined such that each hologram is visited twice where the processing order of the wedges is random to minimize directional bias in the reconstructed object .",
    "the reconstruction runs on a simple laptop with intel i7 cpu and 8 gigabytes of ram , computing for about 20 minutes .",
    "each of the newton steps takes four cg - iterations , which means that the total solution - processing every incident angle twice - requires only 10 forward and adjoint operations of the full imaging operator @xmath138 .",
    "figure [ fig:4]@xmath117 shows the central slice of the reconstructed @xmath136 perpendicular to the tomographic axis .",
    "it can be seen that the binary character of the specimen and the spherical shapes of the beads are well - resolved , being clearly distinguishable both from one another and from the background .",
    "notably , no artifacts caused by angular undersampling or due to the missing wedge of @xmath161 can be identified .",
    "we estimate the resolution by computing the fourier shell correlation ( fsc ) @xcite of two auxillary reconstructions from complementary sets of 125 and 124 incident angles , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]@xmath118 , the resulting correlation is compared to the @xmath162-bit threshold curve as proposed by @xcite .",
    "for comparison , the fsc is also computed for a reconstruction without positivity constraint .",
    "the beneficial effect of the latter can be seen from the gap between the blue and green curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]@xmath118 , showing a significantly higher correlation especially in the resolution - critical part around the intersections with the threshold curve .",
    "the intersections indicate a resolution of about @xmath0{nm}$ ] and @xmath163{nm}$ ] ( half of the corresponding fourier wavelengths ) for the reconstructions with and without positivity constraint , respectively .",
    "notably , the local minima of the fsc curves at @xmath164{nm^{-1}}$ ] are no artifacts but neatly coincide with the first order zero of the form factor of @xmath147{nm}$]-sized spheres .",
    "this emphasizes the sensitivity of the imaging method to structural features .    according to the slice plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:4]@xmath117 , the positions of the polystyrene spheres and thus the crystal structure could be determined in principle by visual inspection of the reconstructed @xmath136 . in order to determine the colloid locations numerically and independent of an operator",
    ", we smoothen the recovered object by a gaussian of @xmath0{nm}$ ] fwhm to reduce the impact of noise before deconvolving with the form factor of a homogeneous @xmath147{nm}$]-sized sphere ( with regularization around the zeros in fourier space ) .",
    "this procedure results in gaussian peaks centered at the positions of polystyrene beads . by computing the maxima of this field using quadratic interpolation about the peaks",
    ", we thus obtain a representation of the crystal structure .    by the simple deconvolution procedure outlined above ,",
    "448 colloid positions are identified . convolving the obtained dirac delta - array of bead locations with the ideal @xmath147{nm}$]-sized sphere yields a binary representation of the colloidal crystal . a slice of this binarization corresponding to fig .",

    "the corresponding site coordinates of the colloids , i.e. the centers of the spherical beads , are provided in data file 1 .",
    "the imaged micro - crystal contains regions of ( approximately ) hexagonal close - packing as well as cubic and amorphous regions , induced by an interplay of bulk- and surface effects .",
    "in this work , we have presented iteratively regularized gauss - newton methods ( irgnm ) as a generic approach to solve nonlinear ill - posed image reconstruction problems .",
    "the principal idea is to reconstruct an unknown object by iteratively inverting linearizations of a known imaging model , which describes contrast formation from object to observable data . in order to compensate for missing information ,",
    "the iterates are computed to provide an optimal compromise between the measurements and additional _ a priori _ information on the unknown object .",
    "the irgnm approach differs from well - known alternating - projection - type algorithms typically used in cdi in that it exploits differentiability and _ simultaneously _ processes constraints and observed data .",
    "this promises improved convergence .    by applying regularized newton methods to near - field phase constrast imaging , both in 2d and in a tomographic 3d setting",
    ", we have demonstrated their flexibility in treating different experimental setups .",
    "the reconstruction of a nano - structured test pattern shows that irgnm constitute a reasonable generalization of direct inversion methods based on a _ global _ linearization of contrast formation . owing to its potential to incorporate moderate nonlinearity and _ a priori _ knowledge , e.g.  on support or positivity , the approach permits faithful reconstructions beyond the scope of such direct methods .",
    "this has been demonstrated by the simultaneous recovery of magnitude and phase of the test object from a single diffraction pattern without assuming proportionality of phase shifts and absorption .",
    "the validity of the reconstruction is supported by results for a simulated object composed of two materials , which are correctly identified by the algorithm .",
    "however , numerical simulations also indicate that the stability of the simultaneous recovery deteriorates significantly with increasing fresnel number .",
    "thus , it is possibly only feasible for deeply holographic near field data as considered in this work .",
    "a further benefit of the presented regularized newton framework is that it requires only a _ forward _ model for the imaging setup and no explicit knowledge of ( approximate ) inverses .",
    "this enables irgnm reconstructions also for complicated multi - staged imaging setups , possibly including the influence of various experimental parameters . in the considered example of phase contrast tomography",
    "this flexibility permits to directly recover a probed 3d - object from the complete tomogram of diffraction patterns instead of subsequently performing ( 2d ) phase retrieval and tomographic backprojection .",
    "we have demonstrated the potential of this approach by imaging a colloidal crystal composed of @xmath147{nm}$]-sized polystyrene beads at @xmath0{nm}$ ] resolution , reconstructed by an efficient regularized newton - kaczmarz method .",
    "x - ray imaging techniques currently reach out for novel frontiers , ranging from new contrast modalities in material science and dose reduction in biomedical analysis to in - operando studies and investigations of highest spatial and temporal resolution by fel pulses . to enable these goals ,",
    "the mathematical modeling underlying image reconstruction has to become increasingly accurate in order not to bottleneck the achievable contrast and resolution : apart from nonlinearity of image formation and poissonian noise statistics , future imaging models may need to better account for partial coherence , non - uniform illumination , mechanical vibrations and movements , misalignment or geometrical aberrations , just to name a few .",
    "owing to their flexibility , we are convinced that regularized newton methods , as presented in this work , may greatly foster such developments and thus contribute to a bring lensless x - ray techniques as well as other cutting - edge imaging methods to the level of quantitative structural measurements .",
    "we thank janne - mieke meijer and andrei petukhov for providing us with a colloidal crystal film some time ago , from which we could later prepare the micro - crystal used here as a test object .",
