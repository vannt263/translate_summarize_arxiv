    "high energy radiation from many astrophysical objects is believed to be generated in shock heated plasma where charged particles are accelerated by the fermi mechanism , eg .",

    "the maximum particle energy is set by the condition that radiative losses between acceleration episodes ( which is the time it takes to travel from one side of shock front to the other ) should be smaller than the energy gain .",
    "this upper bound to electron energy means that the emergent synchrotron radiation falls off to zero above a certain cut - off frequency which is about 50 mev in the plasma rest frame independent of the magnetic field strength in the shock heated fluid ( de jager & harding , 1992 ; lyutikov , 2009 ; piran & nakar , 2010 ; the derivation is provided in the next section ) .    many astrophysical objects , such as supernova ( sn ) remnants , pulsars , agns and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , emit photons of energy larger than @xmath0mev , and this upper limit has been used to eliminate the electron synchrotron process in shock - heated plasma as the radiation mechanism for these objects .",
    "however , we show in this letter that the @xmath1 mev upper limit can be violated under certain astrophysically realistic conditions .    the upper limit of 50 mev for synchrotron radiation is arrived at by assuming a uniform magnetic field throughout shock heated plasma .",
    "we show that this upper limit can be considerably raised when the magnetic field is not uniform .",
    "a particular case we analyze in some detail is where the magnetic field decays with distance down - stream of the shock front , and find that for a range of parameters there can be a significant synchrotron flux even at several gev ( in fluid comoving frame ) .",
    "this is described in section 2 .",
    "the calculations presented in section 2 can be easily generalized to consider a situation where magnetic field fluctuates randomly instead of decaying with distance from the shock front .",
    "the application to a few astrophysical systems are presented in  3 .",
    "the argument that the maximum photon energy for synchrotron emission for shock accelerated electrons is @xmath1 mev is straightforward and goes as follows .",
    "electrons gain energy by a factor @xmath2 whenever they cross a relativistic shock front and are scattered back to the other side .",
    "the time it takes for a charge particle of lorentz factor @xmath3 to make this trip from one side of the shock front to the other is of order of the larmor time , @xmath4 ; where @xmath5 is the comoving frame magnetic field strength , @xmath6 is the particle mass , and @xmath7 is its charge .",
    "the energy lost to synchrotron radiation during this time is @xmath8 .",
    "particle acceleration ceases when @xmath9 , and therefore the maximum lorentz factor a particle can attain is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the thomson cross - section .",
    "the synchrotron photon energy corresponding to @xmath12 is @xmath13 thus , the maximum photon energy for electrons is @xmath1 mev and for protons @xmath0 gev - rays with energy of @xmath0gev in plasma comoving frame , this is a very inefficient mechanism and not likely to play a significant role in grbs . ] .",
    "these numbers might be overestimated by a factor 5 - 10 due to uncertainty regarding the time it takes particles to travel from one side of the shock front to the other ( which could be an order of magnitude larger than the larmor time assumed in these calculations , e.g. achterberg et al .",
    "2001 , lemoine & revenu 2006 , sagi & nakar 2012 , uchiyama et al .",
    "all calculations in this paper are affected by this uncertainty .",
    "however , the ratio of @xmath14 for the case of a uniform magnetic field to that for an inhomogeneous field geometry , discussed below , should be fairly secure .",
    "let us consider that the magnetic field decays with distance down - stream of the shock front as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the length scale over which the field decays , @xmath17 & @xmath18 are the strongest and weakest magnetic field strengths in the shocked fluid , and @xmath19 . if magnetic field is generated by the weibel mechanism then @xmath16 is of order the plasma length scale ( medvedev & loeb , 1999 ) , i.e. @xmath20^{1/2 } =       2.2\\rmx10 ^ 7 { \\rm cm } ( \\gamma_s / n_e)^{1/2 }    \\label{lp}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is proton mass , @xmath22 is the lorentz factor of the shock front wrt the unshocked fluid , and @xmath23 is the number density of electrons in the shocked fluid comoving frame",
    ".    particles accelerated in a shock influence the generation of magnetic fields and can substantially increase the length scale for field decay ( medvedev et al .",
    "2005 ; medvedev & zakutnyaya , 2009 ; keshet et al .",
    "a larger coherence length magnetic field produced by high energy particles  which have larger plasma scale",
    " decays on a longer time scale .",
    "however , these fields are also likely to be weaker ( medvedev & zakutnyaya , 2009 ) , although their true strength is quite uncertain .",
    "we , therefore , use measurements of magnetic fields in grb afterglows for guidance .",
    "the volume averaged magnetic field energy density in grb external shocks , while they are relativistic , is found to be a factor @xmath24 smaller than the equipartition value for a good fraction of bursts ( panaitescu & kumar , 2001 , 2002 ; bjornsson et al .",
    "2004 ; wei et al .",
    "2006 ; rykoff et al . 2006 ; rol et al . 2007 ; chandra et al . 2008 ;",
    "liang et al . 2008 ; gao et al . 2009 ; xu et al . 2009 ; cenko et al . 2010 ; rossi et al . 2011 ; kumar & barniol duran , 2010 ) .",
    "this suggests that the field decays with distance downstream by a factor @xmath0 since the strength close to the shock front , due to the weibel instability , is of order of the equipartition value . the length scale for this decay , however , is uncertain . for the sake of concreteness",
    "we take @xmath16 to be plasma scale for our calculations . fortunately , the results presented in this paper do nt depend on the precise length - scale for field decay as long as it is much smaller than the distance traveled by the highest energy electrons before they lose their energy to radiation .",
    "the larmor radius of an electron , @xmath25 , increases with distance from the shock front as the magnetic field gets weaker ( eq . [ bx0 ] ) , and an electron traveling down - stream is likely to be sent back upstream when @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the distance from the shock - front ) .",
    "therefore , an absolute upper limit on @xmath3 is set by the requirement that @xmath28 is smaller than the width of the shock heated plasma",
    ".    a more stringent upper limit on @xmath3 is obtained by the requirement that energy lost by an electron to radiation while traveling from up - stream to down - stream ( in between two consecutive episodes of energy gain ) should be smaller than @xmath29 .",
    "the energy loss rate for an electron of lf @xmath3 due to synchrotron radiation while traveling down - stream of the shock front is @xmath30 ^ 2.\\ ] ] we are interested in the case where @xmath31 .",
    "however , since @xmath16  the length scale over which the magnetic field decays  is much - much smaller than the thickness of the shocked plasma , most of the synchrotron loss occurs in the region of low magnetic field ( @xmath32 ) , which also controls the maximum lorenz factor of electrons , provided that @xmath33/(2\\eta-1 ) <          b_0 ^ 2 \\ , ( r_l / l_p),\\ ] ] where @xmath34 ; the above equation is obtained by calculating energy loss in the region of low magnetic field ( @xmath18 ) where the electron travels a distance @xmath35 , and the loss in the region @xmath36 , and requiring the former to be larger . since @xmath37 for the case of interest , the above condition simplifies to @xmath38 when @xmath39 .",
    "thus , one of the requirements for exceeding the @xmath1 mev limit is that the width of the region occupied by high magnetic fields ( @xmath40 ) is much smaller than @xmath28 . the above condition ( eq . [ bw_b0 ] )",
    "also guarantees that the larmor radius of electron in the region of high magnetic field is much larger than @xmath16 , and thus the deflection of electron orbit while passing through this region is small ; electrons are turned around in the region of low magnetic field which occupies most of the shocked plasma volume .",
    "the maximum lf of an electron , @xmath12 , is obtained by requiring that the energy loss due to synchrotron radiation in a larmor time ( @xmath41 ) not exceed @xmath42 .",
    "the case of interest is where electrons lose their energy while traveling through the region of weak magnetic field . in this case",
    "@xmath12 is same as given in equation ( [ gam_max1 ] ) , i.e. @xmath43 this lorentz factor must satisfy the condition that @xmath44 is smaller than the comoving radial width of the shocked fluid ( the width is @xmath45 by causality argument ) , i.e. the electron is confined to the system .",
    "this requires @xmath46^{1/3 } ( m_e c^2      \\gamma / r)^{2/3 } = 0.1\\,{\\rm mg}\\ ; ( \\gamma / r_{17})^{2/3 } ,     \\label{b0_min}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the lorentz factor of the shocked fluid , @xmath48 is the distance of the shock front from the center of explosion , and we have adopted the widely used convenient notation @xmath49 .",
    "electrons also suffer ic loss of energy which is ignored here ; considering that @xmath50 , ic scatterings are in klein - nishina regime and thus the ic loss is highly suppressed ( barniol duran & kumar , 2011 ) .    the maximum synchrotron frequency , in shock comoving frame ,",
    "is given by @xmath51 which is larger than the case of a uniform magnetic field by a factor @xmath52 .",
    "we next estimate the synchrotron flux at @xmath14 to see whether it lies on the powerlaw extension of flux at lower frequencies ( @xmath53 mev ) or not .",
    "let us consider electrons of lf @xmath54 which produce synchrotron photons of frequency @xmath55 . by the definition of @xmath12 these electrons will lose half of their energy while traveling down - stream of the shock front .",
    "the energy fraction of these electrons lost to synchrotron radiation ( @xmath56 ) while they travel through the region where the magnetic field strength is @xmath57 is @xmath58 ^ 2   b_0^{3/2 } ( \\gamma_s / n_e)^{1/2 } ,     \\label{xi1}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the larmor radius , and we made use of equations ( [ lp ] ) & ( [ gam_max ] ) to substitute for @xmath16 & @xmath12 .",
    "the frequency of radiation produced in the region of high magnetic field ( @xmath17 ) is @xmath60 which is given by equation ( [ numax_new ] ) .",
    "much of the rest of the electron energy is lost to radiation in the region occupied by the weaker field @xmath18 , and the synchrotron frequency of the emergent radiation from this region is @xmath61 ; where @xmath62 mev is the maximum synchrotron frequency when the magnetic field is uniform .",
    "the specific flux at @xmath14 is obtained from the equation @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the spectral index between @xmath64 and @xmath14  defined as @xmath65  is @xmath66 the second equality is obtained by substituting for @xmath56 from equation ( [ xi1 ] ) .",
    "it can be shown , after some algebra , that @xmath67 can not be larger than @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the index for electron distribution .",
    "we note that the synchrotron radiation formula can only be used provided that the magnetic field is coherent on scale @xmath70 cm .",
    "the coherence scale for magnetic field close to the shock - front is @xmath71 cm .",
    "thus , we see that the coherence length for magnetic fields is much larger than @xmath72 as long as @xmath73 0.1 mg .",
    "the coherence scale grows with increasing distance from the shock front ( since smaller scale fields have time to decay ) , and so does the larmor radius .",
    "however , as long as @xmath74 mg , the magnetic field is coherent on length scales that are much larger than @xmath72 everywhere down - stream of the shock front .",
    "therefore , it is safe to use the synchrotron radiation results as we have in this section .",
    "we consider two particular applications of the results found in the previous section , one of which is the application to grb afterglow radiation , and the other is the application to synchrotron radiation from sn remnants .",
    "the relativistic jet produced in grbs drives a shock wave into the medium in the vicinity of the burst , and synchrotron radiation from shock heated plasma is responsible for the long lived afterglow radiation from radio to @xmath75-ray frequencies ( eg .",
    "piran , 2004 ; meszaros 2006 ; gehrels et al . 2009 ; zhang 2007 ) .",
    "roughly half of the grb jet energy is imparted to the surrounding medium at the deceleration radius , @xmath76 , which is given by , eg .",
    "piran ( 2004 ) , zhang ( 2007 ) @xmath77^{1/3 }          \\sim 1.2\\rmx10^{17}{\\rm cm } ( e_{53}/n_0)^{1/3 }         \\gamma_{0,2}^{-2/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the isotropic equivalent of energy carried by the jet , @xmath79 is the average number density of protons in the unshocked medium within the region of radius @xmath76 , and @xmath80 is the initial lorentz factor of the jet .",
    "the lorentz factor of the jet decreases with distance as @xmath81 .",
    "the comoving radial width of the shocked plasma is @xmath82 , and therefore @xmath83 .    the minimum magnetic field expected in the shocked fluid is @xmath84 which is simply the field of the grb circum - stellar - medium ( csm ) compressed by the relativistic shock by a factor @xmath85 ; where @xmath86 is the field in the csm at a distance @xmath87 from the center of explosion and is expected to be of order a few @xmath88 g .",
    "thus , the condition that electrons of lorentz factor @xmath12 are confined to the shocked fluid by the weak magnetic field ( see eq . [ b0_min ] ) is satisfied for grb external shocks as long as the shock is highly relativistic ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the field is likely amplified by a large factor immediately down - stream of the shock front by the two - stream instability , such that the energy density in the magnetic field is a fraction , @xmath90 , of the thermal energy density of the shocked fluid ( medvedev & loeb , 1999 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath91 with @xmath92 ( medvedev & loeb , 1999 ) ; we have used here the relativistic self - similar shock solution ( blandford & mckee , 1976 ) according to which the thermal energy density behind the shock front is @xmath93 .",
    "this magnetic field has a coherence length of order the plasma scale and decays down - stream of the shock front ( gruzinov , 2001 ; sironi & spitkovsky , 2011 ; but see also medvedev et al .",
    "it is unclear what is the exact value of the field very far from the shock front .",
    "according to recent numerical simulations of sironi & spitkovsky ( 2011 ) the far field might be of order the shocked compressed ism field ; empirically we know from grb afterglows that @xmath94 for a large fraction of bursts ( see  2.1 for references to a number of papers on this topic ) .",
    "therefore , for grb afterglows we expect the ratio between @xmath17 and @xmath18 to be larger than @xmath95 and possibly of order @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the ism magnetic field in units of 10 @xmath88 g ; the precise value of @xmath52 is not important as long as it is larger than @xmath98 , and the field decays on a length - scale that is short compared with the larmor radius ( @xmath28 ) or the distance the highest energy electrons travel before losing half their energy . substituting this into equation ( [ numax_new ] )",
    "we find @xmath99 the maximum energy for synchrotron photons in the observer frame is @xmath100 . if the time it takes for an electron to travel from one side of the shock front to another is larger than @xmath41 by a factor 510 then @xmath14 would be smaller than given by the above equation by the same factor .     and @xmath101 .",
    "the solid , dashed and dotted lines correspond to @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively ( and @xmath105 ) . similarly , @xmath102 and",
    "@xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 for the red , black and blue lines , respectively . for all these cases ,",
    "@xmath109 and @xmath110 , and the size of the system is larger than @xmath28 by a factor of @xmath111 .",
    "the spectrum above @xmath112 mev , has a power - law slope roughly equal to the spectrum at lower frequencies and it extends to well beyond @xmath64 .",
    "the flux at @xmath64 can exhibit a sharp decline by almost an order of magnitude for certain parameters , however , the flux at @xmath113gev even in the worst case lies on a slightly steeper power - law extension of the lower energy ( @xmath114 mev ) spectrum . ]    using equations ( [ beta ] ) & ( [ bw_b0 ] ) one can obtain an approximate analytical power - law spectral index for @xmath115 ; however , we have calculated the spectrum numerically for different choices of parameters and present the results in figure  [ spectra ] .",
    "the spectrum in the observer frame should extend to @xmath116 tev energies provided that ic losses do nt prevent electrons from accelerating to @xmath117 ( eq . [ gam_max ] ) , and these high energy photons are not converted to pairs while traveling from the emission site to ustev from a source at cosmological distance are converted to electron - position pairs due to interaction with infrared background radiation . ] ; the effect of ic loss on @xmath12 , in the context of grbs , is discussed in barniol duran & kumar ( 2011 ) and piran & nakar ( 2010 ) .",
    "for certain range of parameters the flux at photon energies much larger than 50 mev@xmath118 lies below the powerlaw extrapolation of flux below @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , and in those cases the flux at very high energies is likely to be lower than the sensitivity limit of current detectors .",
    "several bursts detected by the fermi satellite show emission above 10 gev in the grb host galaxy rest frame : abdo et al .",
    "( 2009a , b , 2010 ) , ackermann et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "these bursts violate the conventional upper limit of @xmath119 mev @xmath120 gev for synchrotron radiation from shock heated plasma , eg .",
    "piran & nakar ( 2010 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath12110@xmath122 mev data for these bursts is in excellent agreement with synchrotron radiation from the external shock , which also provides a very nice fit to the late time x - ray , optical and radio data using the same exact parameters that provide a fit to the early @xmath12110@xmath122 mev data ( kumar & barniol duran , 2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "this conflict between the excellent fit to the high energy data on one hand and the conventional upper limit on synchrotron photon energy of @xmath116 5 gev on the other hand can be resolved provided that the magnetic field just behind the shock front is much larger than far down - stream ; photons of energy @xmath123 gev are produced by electrons of lf @xmath124 while they travel through regions of stronger magnetic field close to the shock front .",
    "we note that there is a large uncertainty regarding the length scale over which fields decay , @xmath17 & @xmath18 .",
    "however , the comoving frame 50 mev limit on synchrotron photons is violated whenever @xmath125 , and the distance electrons of lf @xmath12 travel before losing their energy to radiation is large compared to the length - scale for the decay of magnetic field .",
    "the data for grbs with @xmath126 gev emission show that the volume averaged magnetic field in the shocked fluid is a factor 10@xmath127 smaller than the equipartition value mev ; otherwise the ratio of flux at 150 kev to that at 100 mev would be much larger than the observed value ( large cooling frequency , @xmath126 mev , implies small magnetic field ) . ]",
    "( kumar & barniol duran , 2010 ) whereas the weibel generated field strength in the immediate vicinity of the shock front is expected to be @xmath128% of the equipartition value ( medvedev & loeb , 1999 ) , and therefore @xmath129 for these bursts .",
    "the deceleration radius for supernova remnants is @xmath130^{1/3 }      \\approx 5\\rmx10^{18 } ( e_{51}/n_0)^{1/3 } v_{0,9}^{-2/3}\\,{\\rm cm},\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the kinetic energy of the remnant , and @xmath131 is its initial speed in unit of 10@xmath132 cm / s .",
    "the radius increases with time as @xmath133 during the adiabatic expansion phase of the remnant .",
