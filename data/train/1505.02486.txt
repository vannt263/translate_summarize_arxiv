    "figure [ fig : channel ] displays the velocity channel maps of the @xmath0  and @xmath2emission lines with a velocity interval of 0.4 km s@xmath7 . the @xmath0  emission is significantly detected in two velocity ranges : one is the range @xmath65 km s@xmath7 and the other is the range",
    "@xmath66 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath0  emission is weak in the range @xmath67 km s@xmath7where the @xmath2emission is prominent .",
    "this indicates that there is a velocity component at @xmath68@xmath69 km s@xmath7 , and the optically thick @xmath0  emission line is heavily self - absorbed while the optically thinner @xmath2emission appears as emission , which is obvious in the position - velocity ( pv ) diagrams shown in figures [ fig : v0 ] ( a ) and ( b ) together with the intensity - weighted mean velocity map of the @xmath2emission in figure [ fig : v0 ] ( c ) .",
    "note that , in addition to the velocity component at @xmath70 km s@xmath7 , there are also distinct components at @xmath71 and @xmath72 km s@xmath7detected in @xmath2just around the h@xmath4ii  region . in the next subsection , we discuss the details of the velocity structures of the observed region .      a careful inspection of the @xmath0  and @xmath2data infers that the observed region consists of at least four velocity components at @xmath73 , 5 , 7 , and 10 km s@xmath7 .",
    "as summarized in table [ tab : components ] , the @xmath70 km s@xmath7component represents the systemic velocity of the entire w40 region , and the @xmath71 and @xmath72 km s@xmath7components are likely to originate from dense gas located along the expanding shell of the h@xmath4ii  region .",
    "the dense gas corresponds to clump 1 ( @xmath71 km s@xmath7 ) and clumps 5 and 6 ( @xmath72 km s@xmath7 ) detected in @xmath2that we will describe in sections [ sec : dense ] and [ sec : model ] .",
    "the @xmath74 km s@xmath7component is weak and shows up in a very limited region , and it might be unrelated to w40 . as explained in the following , the four velocity components can be recognized in the @xmath0  and @xmath2spectra .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spe ] , we show examples of the @xmath0  and @xmath2spectra observed at some positions mainly around the ysos together with the velocity channel maps with a coarser velocity interval ( 1.3 km s@xmath7 ) than figure 2 .",
    "the four components can be seen in some of the spectra .",
    "for example , the spectra in panels ( a)(c ) sampled in the west of the h@xmath4ii  region consist only of the @xmath71 km s@xmath7component , and those in panels ( f ) and ( g ) sampled in the south of the h@xmath4ii  region exhibit the @xmath72 km s@xmath7component as well . note that the @xmath71 and @xmath72 km s@xmath7components are detected both in @xmath0  and @xmath2only around the h@xmath4ii  region .",
    "in addition , the @xmath2spectra in panels ( e ) and ( i ) consist of the @xmath70 km s@xmath7component . the @xmath74 km s@xmath7component is detected both in @xmath0  and @xmath2 and is seen only around the positions shown in panels ( j ) and ( k ) .",
    "compared with the 2mass image in figure [ fig : spe ] , the @xmath71 and @xmath72 km s@xmath7components exhibit intense @xmath0  emission , and they are likely to delineate the expanding shell around the h@xmath4ii  region . the @xmath70 km s@xmath7component is well detected in @xmath2and is likely to represent the systemic velocity of the entire w40 region .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the absence of the intense @xmath0  emission for the @xmath70 km s@xmath7component indicates that there is a large amount of cold gas in the foreground of the h@xmath4ii  region , which should cause the heavy absorption in @xmath0  around this velocity . actually , the @xmath0  emission line over the velocity range @xmath75 km s@xmath7have a brightness temperature of only @xmath76 k while the optically thinner @xmath2emission line is brighter ( up to @xmath77 k ) as seen in figure [ fig : spe ] ( e ) .",
    "the above results are consistent with those obtained through earlier observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "molecular observations done by @xcite covers the arc - shaped structure just around the h@xmath4ii  region , and they detected the two velocity components at @xmath71 and @xmath78 km s@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite made @xmath0  @xmath79 observations with a lower angular resolution ( hpbw@xmath80 ) , and they detected the @xmath0  emission at @xmath71 and @xmath72 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the author also found an absorption line at @xmath70 km s@xmath7 in the oh spectra obtained by additional observations with the nrao 43 m telescope ( hpbw@xmath81 ) .",
    "based on these data , @xcite concluded that w40 has a single component with a peak velocity at @xmath82 km s@xmath7 , which is extended in the wide velocity range @xmath83 km s@xmath7 and is self - absorbed at around 7 km s@xmath7by colder gas in the foreground .",
    "we agree with their interpretation that w40 is surrounded by the @xmath70 km s@xmath7component .",
    "in addition , we found the existence of two other velocity components at @xmath71 and @xmath72 km s@xmath7around the h@xmath4ii  region , probably originating from the dense gas located along the expanding shell , which are detected both in @xmath0  ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath2(@xmath3 ) as seen in the pv diagram in figure [ fig : v0 ] as well as in the spectra in figures [ fig : spe ] ( b ) and ( f ) .",
    "looking at the @xmath0  spectra in figure [ fig : spe ] , there are some cases in which high velocity wings are obviously seen in spite of the huge complexity in the velocity field . for example",
    ", the @xmath0  spectrum in figure [ fig : spe ] ( a ) exhibits a blue - shifted wing at @xmath68@xmath84 km s@xmath7 , and the one in figure [ fig : spe ] ( g ) exhibits a red - shifted wing at @xmath68@xmath85 km s@xmath7 . these wings are very likely to be tracing real high velocity gas , not mere gaussian tails of the intense @xmath0  spectra of the @xmath71 and @xmath72 km s@xmath7components . as detailed in the appendix [ sec : gaussian_fit ] , most of the @xmath0  spectra in the observed region can be well fitted by simple gaussian functions except for the apparent high velocity wings as seen in figure [ fig : spe ] ( a ) and ( g ) .",
    "because the high velocity wings are often seen in the @xmath0  spectra along the dense condensations traced in @xmath2both around the h@xmath4ii  region and the filamentary structure , we suggest that they are either the high velocity gas blown away by the expansion of the h@xmath4ii  region or the outflowing gas driven by ysos forming in the dense condensations . at the moment",
    ", there is no way to distinguish these two effects reliably only with the present dataset , and both of them should be actually at play .",
    "modeling the expected signature of instabilities in high velocity gas from h@xmath4ii  region expansion is beyond the scope of the current study . for the purpose of this study ,",
    "we interpret apparent high velocity wings on the principal velocity components of @xmath0  as evidence of potential  candidate \" outflows from ysos and derive their parameters accordingly . though a certain fraction of the high velocity wings can be due to the expansion of the h@xmath4ii  region , there are some high velocity wings found in the vicinity of ysos ( e.g. ,  b2 \" and  r2 \" in the following ) including the one located away from the h@xmath4ii  region ( e.g. ,  r4 \" ) which are likely to be promising outflows from ysos .",
    "since the dense gas consists of the @xmath71 km s@xmath7 , @xmath70 km s@xmath7 , and @xmath72 km s@xmath7components , we searched for outflow candidates blowing out from these components . for the @xmath83 km s@xmath7component , we did not find any high velocity wings in the @xmath0  spectra , and thus we disregarded this component . in order to carry out a systematic search for outflows , we set constant velocity ranges to find high velocity wings in the @xmath0  spectra .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : model1 ] , we decided to use the velocity ranges @xmath86 km s@xmath7and @xmath87 km s@xmath7 for the blue- and red - shifted high velocity wings of outflows , respectively .",
    "basically , we can carry out a reliable search for outflow candidates in @xmath0  only in these velocity ranges , because the heavy absorption by the @xmath70 km s@xmath7component precludes the detection of the faint wing emission over the range @xmath88 km s@xmath7 .",
    "however , for a reference , we will also investigate wing emission possibly associated with the @xmath71 and @xmath72 km s@xmath7components in the range @xmath89 km s@xmath7and @xmath90 km s@xmath7 , because , in the vicinity of the h@xmath4ii  region , @xcite found a bipolar outflow associated with the @xmath71 km s@xmath7component , though we now realize that its red - shifted wing emission should be contaminated by the heavy absorption .",
    "figure [ fig : outflow ] shows the @xmath0  intensity distributions integrated over the velocity ranges mentioned in the above .",
    "the overall distributions of the high velocity gas in the figures show a great complexity similar to what has been reported for the circinus cloud where the complex outflow lobes are found to be a mixture of some smaller outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is likely the case also for w40 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0  distributions in the figures are contaminated by some distinct velocity components ( at @xmath91 km s@xmath7 ) unrelated to the outflows .",
    "the @xmath0  distributions on the sky are too complex to separate them reliably into single outflow candidates only from the present dataset . in this paper",
    ", we thus decided to pick up the local peaks in the @xmath0  intensity map in figure [ fig : outflow ] if they are not due to the distinct velocity components but are very likely due to outflows showing a wing - like feature in the @xmath0  spectra .",
    "as a result , we found 13 local peaks as indicated in figure [ fig : outflow ] .",
    "for simplicity , we will regard each of the 13 local peaks as the peak position of a single high velocity lobe and we will consider them to be candidates of outflows in w40 .",
    "there are nine blue lobes and four red lobes .",
    "as summarized in table [ tab : outflow1 ] , we call the blue lobes  b1\"b9 \" , and the red lobes  r1\"r4 \"",
    ".    to measure some physical properties , we defined the surface area of the outflow lobes @xmath92 at the 1.2 k km s@xmath7(corresponding to the @xmath93 noise level ) contour level . in the case",
    "that two or more lobes are attached to each other at this threshold value , we divided them into single lobes at the valley in the contour maps of the @xmath0  intensity ( figure [ fig : outflow ] ) .",
    "we also attempted to find driving sources of the outflow lobes .",
    "it is however also difficult to identify the driving sources reliably , and thus we simply picked up ysos located within @xmath92 defined in the above as possible candidates for the driving sources .",
    "there are nine outflow candidates ( b1 , b2 , b4 , b6 , b7 , b8 , r1 , r2 , and r4 ) with at least one candidate of the driving source , and there are four outflow candidates ( b3 , b5 , b9 , and r3 ) which could not be assigned to any known sources .",
    "we summarize the main features of the outflow lobes as follows .    * blue lobes : * blue lobes are seen mainly around the h@xmath4ii  region . a candidate for",
    "the driving source of b1 is 1.2 mm source , which is found and classified as  starless \" by @xcite .",
    "a jet - like blue lobes b2 and b3 elongated in the east - west direction are clearly seen in figure [ fig : outflow ] .",
    "b3 is the largest lobe located close to irs 5 .",
    "multiple blue lobes b4b8 are located to the south of the h@xmath4ii  region .",
    "b9 is a small lobe found in the filament structure . b1b8",
    "correspond to an outflow discovered by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their figure 3 ) with lower angular resolution ( @xmath94 ) , which is resolved into smaller multiple possible outflows in our map .    * red lobes : * two red lobes r1 and r2 are detected in the vicinity of irs 1a south , suggesting that these outflow candidates possibly originate in the cluster .",
    "candidates of driving sources for these lobes are classified as class i protostars @xcite .",
    "the lobes r3 and r4 are found in the filament structure .    finally , in figure [ fig : outflow2](a ) and ( b ) , we compared the distributions of the outflow candidates with the continuum - subtracted 2.12 @xmath95 h@xmath96 narrowband image obtained by @xcite to search for the possible counterparts of the co outflow lobes .",
    "we also compared our map with the _ spitzer _ irac 4.5 @xmath95 image in figure [ fig : outflow2](c ) and ( d ) to see whether vibrationally excited co emission is detected around the outflow candidates .",
    "however , we could not identify clear counterparts corresponding to the outflow lobes in these images , though there are some near / mid - infrared nebulosity in the vicinity .    according to the _ herschel _ map ( the left panel of figure [ fig : iimap ] ( b ) )",
    ", the h@xmath4ii  region is apparently expanding into the surrounding medium , and some of the identified lobes ( i.e. , b2 , b3 , r1 , and r2 ) are located in less dense regions at the edge of the h@xmath4ii  region .",
    "furthermore , these lobes are associated with the @xmath97 and @xmath72 km s@xmath7components which are likely to represent the expanding velocity of the shell ( see section [ sec : model ] ) . for the lobes found just around the h@xmath4ii  region , we can not distinguish if the observed high velocity gas is due to real outflows from ysos or is merely tracing the expanding shell .",
    "in addition to the above possibility , we should also note that some of the identified lobes might not originate from a single yso ( see figure [ fig : outflow ] ) , but originate from the cluster in the h@xmath4ii  region .",
    "all of these ambiguities arise from the complex velocity filed in w40 , especially the heavy absorption by the @xmath70 km s@xmath7component . in this paper",
    ", we will regard the 13 blue- and red - shifted high velocity lobes to be candidates of outflows in this region and will estimate some outflow parameters in section [ sec : parameters ] .",
    "in order to estimate the masses of the outflow candidates , we assumed that the @xmath0  molecules are in the local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) and also that the @xmath0  emission is optically thin at all wing velocities to calculate the column densities in the outflow lobes for a uniform excitation temperature of @xmath98 k. we then estimated the mass , momentum , and energy of the outflow lobes .",
    "details of the calculations of the physical parameters are described in appendix [ sec : outflow2 ] , and the results are summarized in table [ tab : outflow1 ] .",
    "@xcite suggested a total mass of 0.48 @xmath99 for the blue lobe of the outflow they found which corresponds to our b1 to b8 , on the assumption of a distance of 600 pc and a mean molecular weight of 2.72 ( cf . , we assumed 500 pc and 2.4 , respectively ) .",
    "the sum of the corresponding blue lobes in our table [ tab : outflow1 ] amounts only to @xmath100 @xmath101 which would be rescaled to @xmath102 @xmath101 for the same assumptions as theirs .",
    "the difference between their and our estimates is mainly due to the contamination of the distinct velocity component at @xmath91 km s@xmath7(see section [ sec : kinematics ] ) which was not resolved in their observations , and also due to the fact that we defined the surface area of the outflow lobes at a rather high threshold value of 1.2 k km s@xmath7(see section [ sec : outflow ] ) .    as seen in the 8th column of table [ tab : outflow1 ] , we found that the masses of the individual lobes are in the range from @xmath103 @xmath99 to @xmath104 @xmath99 .",
    "the ysos that can be the possible driving sources of these outflow candidates have bolometric luminosities @xmath105 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their table 1 ) . according to a statistical study of outflows by @xcite ,",
    "outflows associated with low - mass ysos with @xmath106 have a mass range of @xmath107 @xmath99 to a few @xmath99 .",
    "the masses of outflow candidates we found in w40 are much smaller than the average mass of outflows associated with low - mass ysos , and are close to the lower end in the plots of the outflow masses versus the bolometric luminosity of the driving sources reported by @xcite ( see their figure 5 ) . here",
    "we estimate the possible errors in the derived parameters caused by our assumptions .",
    "first , we assumed the constant excitation temperature @xmath98 k. an error arising from this assumption should be small , because the outflow masses are insensitive to @xmath108 , and they would fluctuate only by @xmath820@xmath109 at most within the variation of @xmath108 in the mapped region ( @xmath110 k ) .",
    "second , we assumed that wing components in the @xmath0  ( @xmath1 ) emission line are optically thin ( @xmath111 ) , but they might be moderately optically thick .",
    "for example , @xcite investigated 17 outflows associated with low mass stars with the @xmath0  ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath112co ( @xmath1 ) emission lines , and found the optical depths of the @xmath0  ( @xmath1 ) emission line varies in the range @xmath113 with an average value of @xmath114 . if we adopt their average value , the inverse of the escape probability in equation ( [ eq : g ] ) would be @xmath115 .",
    "this infers that our optically thin assumption may cause an underestimation in the mass estimate by a factor of a few .",
    "finally , it is important to remark that the parameter @xmath116 ( i.e. , the velocity range exhibiting the high velocity wings ) in equations ( [ eq : nco])([eq : energy ] ) should be highly underestimated because of the heavy absorption in the velocity range @xmath88 km s@xmath7 , and hence our estimate for the mass , energy , and momentum of the outflows should be highly underestimated . to summarize our outflows survey , we found that 13 candidates of outflow lobes showing wing - like emission in the @xmath0  spectra .",
    "however , we should note that our estimates of the outflow parameters such as the mass , momentum , and energy should give only the lower limits to the actual values mainly because of the heavy absorption at @xmath70 km s@xmath7and the optically thin assumption . for most of the outflow candidates",

    "moreover , the clumps associated with the outflow lobes tend to have broader line widths ( see table [ tab : clump ] ) , suggesting that the outflow lobes are influencing on the kinematics of the parent clumps .",
    "@xcite investigated theoretically the complex interplay between outflows induced by star formation and turbulence of the parent clumps , and showed that outflows should play a significant role in altering the star - forming environments .",
    "the energy and momentum of the outflows found in this study appear too small to give significant influence on the parent clumps , but again , we should note that our estimates for the outflow parameters may suffer from a large uncertainty .      here , we discuss the locations of the identified clumps relative to the h@xmath4ii  region and propose an updated three - dimensional model of w40 .",

    "we first masked the velocity range @xmath179 km s@xmath7where the @xmath0  spectra are heavily contaminated by the absorption , and then fitted each of the @xmath71 km s@xmath7and @xmath72 km s@xmath7components with a gaussian function with two components by applying a weight proportional to the second power of the observed brightness temperature at each velocity .",
    "we demonstrate some examples of the results in figure [ fig : gaussian ] .",
    "panels ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) of the figure show the @xmath0  spectra exhibiting high velocity wings around the @xmath71 km s@xmath7component , the @xmath72 km s@xmath7component , and no obvious high velocity wing , respectively , which are the same spectra shown in figure [ fig : spe](a ) , ( g ) , and ( h ) .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : gaussian ] , the @xmath0  spectra without apparent high velocity wings are nicely fitted by the simple gaussian functions , while those with the apparent wings can not be fitted well , indicating that the high velocity wings are not merely the outskirts of the intense @xmath0  emission at @xmath71 km s@xmath7and @xmath72 km s@xmath7 .",
    "we should also note that we performed the above gaussian fitting to all of the @xmath0  spectra in the observed region , and subtracted the fitted lines from the observed spectra to generate a map of the high velocity wings .",
    "the resulting map ( not shown ) appears very similar to the blue- and red - shifted lobes shown in figure [ fig : outflow ] .",
    "in this appendix , we explain how we calculated the physical parameters of the outflow lobes .",
    "we first derived the excitation temperatures @xmath180 of the observed region from the peak brightness temperature of the @xmath0  data at each observed position .",
    "in general , the observed brightness temperature @xmath181 can be expressed as @xmath182[1-{\\rm exp}(-\\tau)]\\ ] ] where @xmath183 , @xmath184 k , and @xmath185 . here",

    "we derived @xmath180 from equation ( [ eq : radiative ] ) at each pixel in the @xmath0  map assuming that the line is optically thick ( @xmath190 ) at the velocities giving the maximum temperature to @xmath181 .",
    "the resulting @xmath180 varies depending on the positions with the maximum value 65.6 k and the average value @xmath167 k. we will assume @xmath191 k to derive the physical parameters of the outflow lobes .    in order to estimate the total masses of the outflow lobes",

    "we list these constants in table [ tab : const ] .",
    "all of the constants were gathered from jpl catalog and splatalogue .",
    "@xmath197 is related to the optical depth @xmath203 as @xmath204 .",
    "we assume that the high velocity wings of the @xmath0  ( @xmath1 ) emission line are optically thin ( @xmath111 ) , and therefore @xmath205 .    for these values , equation (",

    "the mass of the outflow lobes @xmath213 can be obtained by integrating the product @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the hydrogen mass and @xmath216 is the mean molecular weight assumed to be 2.4 corrected for the @xmath217 helium abundance .",
    "the integration should be made over the surface area of the outflow lobes @xmath92 as @xmath218 where the term @xmath219 is in units of k km s@xmath7arcmin@xmath143 , and @xmath144 is the distance to the outflow candidates in units of pc ( @xmath145 pc for w40 ) .",
    "we defined @xmath92 at the 1.2 k km s@xmath7(corresponding to the @xmath93 noise level ) contour level as defined in section [ sec : outflow ] .",
    "the total momentum @xmath220 and kinetic energy @xmath221 contained in the outflow lobes can be estimated by the following equations , @xmath222 @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the systemic velocity . in order to decide @xmath225",
    ", we derived the @xmath2spectra averaged over the surface areas of each outflow lobe .",
    "we then fitted the spectra with a single gaussian function , and regarded the peak velocity of the gaussian function as the systemic velocity @xmath225 . in figure",
    "[ fig : avg_spe ] , we show the @xmath2and @xmath0  spectra averaged over the surface areas of the identified high velocity lobes .",
    "the @xmath2emission line of b3 is not detected , for which we assumed @xmath226 km s@xmath7for the lobe .",
    "using equations ( [ eq : mass])([eq : energy ] ) , we calculated @xmath213 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 for the individual outflow lobe .",

    "in general , @xmath227 should be calculated using the maximum separation between the outflow lobes and the driving sources . for the outflow candidates found in w40 , however",
    ", we can not identify the definite driving sources and also can not separate the individual outflow lobes reliably .",
    "we therefore estimated the dynamical timescale as @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the radius of the lobes defined as @xmath230 and @xmath231 is the maximum difference between @xmath154 and the velocities observed in the high velocity wings detected at @xmath232 ( @xmath233 k ) noise level in the @xmath0  spectra observed at the intensity peak positions of the outflow lobes .",
