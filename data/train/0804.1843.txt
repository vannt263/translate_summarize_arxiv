    "the rare decay @xmath3 is very small in the standard model ( sm)@xcite so that it might be very sensitive to the new physics beyond the sm .",
    "furthermore , in the final state the missing energy carried by the neutrino - anti - neutrino pair might be polluted experimentally by other missing - energy - like states in the presence of new physics .",
    "recently , the unparticle model suggested by georgi@xcite provides a possible candidate for the missing energy in @xmath4 . in the unparticle model , below a scale @xmath5 the interaction of the unparticle with the sm sector takes a form like@xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a coefficient function and @xmath8 is a large mass scale of the particles mediating the interaction between the sm fields and the unparticle fields .",
    "if @xmath9 is large enough , the unparticle stuff does not couple strongly to the ordinary particles .",
    "people have introduced many kinds of couplings@xcite , including the yukawa and the partial differential couplings .",
    "a lot of works have been done to study the possible consequence of the unparticle , most of which focus on the exclusive processes . here",
    "we will discuss the inclusive mode @xmath0 , treating the unparticle as part of the missing energy .",
    "we will use heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) in our analysis .",
    "the results are constrained by the data @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . at first",
    ", we apply the hqet results to unparticle model and give out the general form of @xmath10 decay rates .",
    "then we present in the analytical forms the decay width in the free quark approximation and the differential decay width versus the missing energy to the @xmath1 order .",
    "numerical results will be given .",
    "we will summarize at the end .",
    "in the unparticle model , the effective hamiltonian for @xmath11 at quark level is given by @xmath12 for the scalar unparticle , or @xmath13 for the vector unparticle . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the dimensionless coupling constant between the quark current and unparticle fields .",
    "the @xmath16 is a non - integral number severing as the dimension of unparticle operators .",
    "the @xmath16 can not be small than 1 for the unitary of the theory@xcite .",
    "if one impose the conformal symmetry on the vector unparticle fields , the primary , gauge invariant vector unparticle operators could only have dimension @xmath17@xcite .",
    "we will also introduce the two dimensional coefficients corresponding to scalar and vector unparticles @xmath18    the most general forms of differential decay rates for the scalar and vector unparticle final states are @xmath19 where @xmath20 is defined as@xcite @xmath21 the factor @xmath22 in ( [ md ] ) counts for the unparticle phase space@xcite , over which the integrations can be performed in the rest frame of the @xmath23 meson .",
    "the rest part in ( [ md ] ) containing the matrix element squared are conventionally written , in analogy with those in the semileptonic decays in the sm , as the product of the hadron and the unparticle tensors analytical @xcite , @xmath24 where the unparticle tensors are @xmath25 and the hadronic tensor is defined by @xmath26 with @xmath27 .    the most general form of @xmath28 is@xcite @xmath29 the scalar structure functions @xmath30 are functions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the four velocity of the heavy bottom quark .",

    "@xmath34 s can be expanded in @xmath38 using hqet , their forms to @xmath1 can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "there emerge some problems near the endpoint region of the energy spectrum@xcite , which can be avoided by introducing suitable cuts in this work .    applying eqs.([smatrix],[umatrix],[w ] )",
    "we get @xmath39\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times a_{d_\\mathcal{u}}\\theta(p_\\mathcal{u}^0)\\theta(p_\\mathcal{u}^2 ) ( p_\\mathcal{u}^2)^{d_\\mathcal{u}-2}\\frac{d^4p_\\mathcal{u}}{(2\\pi)^4},\\label{scalar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath40 a_{d_\\mathcal{u}}\\theta(p_\\mathcal{u}^0)\\theta(p_\\mathcal{u}^2 ) ( p_\\mathcal{u}^2)^{d_\\mathcal{u}-2}\\frac{d^4p_\\mathcal{u}}{(2\\pi)^4}.\\label{vector}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integrations over @xmath41 in ( [ scalar ] ) and ( [ vector ] ) are constrained by the function @xmath42 and by the condition @xmath43 .",
    "the inclusive differential decay rates are calculated using ( [ scalar ] ) and ( [ vector ] ) by taking @xmath44 .",
    "terms with derivatives of @xmath45 function are evaluated using integrating by parts .",
    "then the differential decay width for the scalar unparticle emission is @xmath46   \\nonumber\\\\ & & + 1/4\\ , { \\delta } ( x-1/2 )   ( \\ 2\\,x-1 )   ( x-1   ) ^{2 } \\big [ { \\lambda_1}\\ , \\big ( ( 4\\ , ( 8\\,{x}^{2}-5\\,x + 1 )   ( x-1 ) ^{2}d_{\\mathcal u}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 8 + 135\\,{x}^{2}-82\\,{x}^{3}-61\\,x- 32\\,{x}^{4 } )   \\big ) + 3\\,{\\lambda_2}\\ , ( 2\\,x-1 )   ( 37\\,{x}^{2 } -39\\,x+10 )   \\big ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & + 1/4\\,{\\delta ' } ( x-1/2 ) { \\lambda_1}\\ , ( 8\\,{x}^{2}-5\\,x+1 )   ( 2\\,x-1   ) ^{2 } ( x-1 ) ^{4 } \\bigg\\ } , { \\label{difs}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for the vector unparticle emission , it is @xmath47 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + { \\delta }   ( x-1/2 )   ( x-1 ) ^{2 } ( 2\\,x-1 )   \\big [ { \\lambda_1}\\ , \\big ( 4\\,d_{\\mathcal u } ( 3 - 9\\,x+8\\,{x}^{2 } )   ( x-1 ) ^{2 } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + x ( 39\\,x-15 + 16\\,{x}^{3}-38\\,{x}^{2 }   )   \\big ) + { \\lambda_2}\\ , ( 6\\,x-3 )   ( 40\\ , { x}^{3}-85\\,{x}^{2}+69\\,x-18 )   \\big ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & + { \\delta ' } ( x-1 /2 ) { \\lambda_1}\\ , ( x-1 ) ^{4 } ( 2\\,x-1   ) ^{2 } ( 3 - 9\\,x+8\\,{x}^{2 } )   \\bigg\\ } , \\label{difv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are parameters in the heavy quark expansion .",
    "here we introduce the dimensionless variable @xmath50 , which serves as unparticle energy modulated by the heavy quark mass .",
    "further integration over @xmath51 will not generally give analytical results for an arbitrary @xmath16 because of the factor @xmath52 in eq.[difs](or [ difv ] ) .",
    "however , when taking the limit @xmath53 we can integrate over @xmath51 .",
    "we get @xmath54 and @xmath55 eqs.([lsts ] ) and ( [ lstv ] ) are the decay widths for @xmath56 in the free quark approximation .    we find that , even if @xmath57 , the scalar unparticle in the final state gives a finite contribution in ( [ lsts ] ) , as a result of the fact that the singularity in the factor @xmath58 is compensated by the factor @xmath59 .",
    "this is not a common feature as in the exclusive processes such like in ref.@xcite",
    ". we can not give a simple analytical formula like ( [ lstv ] ) for the vector unparticle in the final state when @xmath2 .",
    "but under the assumption of exact conform symmetry @xmath60 must be bigger than 3@xcite , then eq.([lstv ] ) is enough at the first order .",
    "numerical results are needed in order to exhibit the unparticle effects .",
    "both the unparticle and neutrino - anti - neutrino pairs serve as the missing energy @xmath61 .",
    "we can not distinguish them in the experiments , so the process @xmath62 may contain both @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the final states .",
    "the decay width is @xmath65 where @xmath66 comes from the sm and @xmath67 come from either the scalar or the vector unparticle contribution .",
    "present calculation in sm@xcite gives @xmath68 the experimental bound@xcite , @xmath69 is about one order larger than the sm calculation .",
    "this large difference allows new physics to provide candidates as the missing energy . in the unparticle model",
    "the candidate is the unparticle .",
    "there are two kinds of singularities brought by the unparticle : one comes from the @xmath70 and the other from @xmath71 . at the quark level , the endpoint of unparticle energy spectrum is singular .",
    "but the true endpoint are at @xmath72 and @xmath73 , depending on the masses of the hadrons . near @xmath73 or @xmath74",
    "when the hqet fails , we introduce some cuts . for the scalar unparticle model",
    ", we set the @xmath75 , _",
    "i. e. _ we take the @xmath76mev that around @xmath77 the hqet fails@xcite .",
    "but for the vector unparticle theory , the case is different because the @xmath78 term in ( [ difv ] ) goes through zero when @xmath79 , so it severs as our cut .",
    "we have taken the mass parameters as@xcite @xmath80 and the heavy quark expansion parameters as @xcite @xmath81    there are very distinctive differences between the unparticle model and the sm in the differential decay widths when @xmath2 .",
    "near the lower endpoint region @xmath82 , the sm differential width approach zero , while the unparticle model gives finite results .",
    "this comes from @xmath83 in the phase space of the unparticle , see eqs.([scalar ] ) and ( [ vector ] ) .",
    "when @xmath84 goes to zero , the phase space goes to infinity .",
    "but the sm final state @xmath85 has no such an enhancement . for the vector unparticle model",
    ", the differential width also gives a finite result at @xmath86 when @xmath87 .",
    "here , the enhancement comes from the vector unparticle tensor @xmath88 in eq.([umatrix ] ) .",
    "@xmath84 appears in the denominator .",
    "near the endpoint @xmath89 , the scalar unparticle model results go to infinity , which comes from the hqet .",
    "there are also such kinds of singularity in sm@xcite . for the vector unparticle model ,",
    "the results go to negative infinity when @xmath51 goes to 1 .",
    "and the vector unparticle contributions vanish near @xmath90 .",
    "this turning comes the from the form of matrix element in ( [ vector ] ) and hqet .",
    "we plot the spectra for the scalar unparticle model in fig . 1 for @xmath91 and fig . 2 for @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "the spectra for vector unparticle model are given in fig .",
    "3 . for @xmath93 , and in fig . 4 for @xmath94 , respectively . note that @xmath93 is allowed if we give up the strict conformal symmetry .",
    "the branching ratios of scalar and vector unparticle emission processes show many resemblances if one neglect the conformal constraint on @xmath16 .",

    "this is quite different from the previous results gained from the similar exclusive decay processes@xcite , where the branching ratios go up as @xmath16 is increaing .",
