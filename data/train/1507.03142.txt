    "contextuality ( namely , the impossibility of explaining probabilities of measurement outcomes as originated from pre - existent values which are not altered by compatible measurements @xcite ) , has recently been identified as a critical resource for quantum computing @xcite and , through nonlocality ( a form of contextuality ) , device - independent secure communication @xcite .",
    "recent progress has allowed us to identify where , how , and why quantum contextuality occurs .",
    "in particular , recent results comprise a necessary and sufficient condition for quantum contextuality @xcite , necessary conditions for quantum state - independent contextuality @xcite , the maximum contextuality possible for any structure of exclusivity @xcite , and a number of principles that explain the quantum limits of contextuality for certain important scenarios @xcite .",
    "in addition , several quantifiers of contextuality have been introduced @xcite , the connections between contextuality , entanglement , and nonlocality have been explored @xcite , and the relationship between quantum contextuality and maximally epistemic interpretations of quantum theory ( qt ) has been examined @xcite .    still , we know very little about the contextuality that can be produced with quantum systems .",
    "for example , is qt the most contextual theory possible ? initially , despite a very appealing candidate as an explanation for qt , the examination of isolated scenarios suggests that the answer should be negative @xcite and that qt is `` neither the most nonlocal theory one can imagine , nor the most contextual '' @xcite .",
    "however , when one applies some simple principles to copies of the scenario @xcite or to extended scenarios which include extra possible measurements @xcite , one finds out that , at least in some key cases , the maximal quantum contextuality of the original scenario is restricted by the fact that this scenario can be embedded into a larger one which is as contextual as possible ( assuming some of these simple principles ) .",
    "this suggests that qt is the most contextual theory allowed by some principles .",
    "however , this leads to another question of fundamental and potentially practical implications : how much contextuality is that ?",
    "how large contextuality can be in qt ?",
    "in which experiments does it occur ?",
    "how does the ratio between the maximal allowed contextuality and the noncontextual bound behave ?",
    "how does this maximum quantum contextuality compare with the contextuality allowed by other theories not restricted by the principles that limit quantum contextuality ?    in this paper",
    "we address these questions . _ a priori _ , they are difficult questions . to deal with them , we first observe that linear contextuality witnesses with all coefficients equal to one can be written as a sum @xmath0 of @xmath1 probabilities such that @xmath2 and @xmath5 are , respectively , the maximum of @xmath0 for noncontextual theories and for the theory under consideration . clearly , @xmath6 .",
    "this motivates the following definition : a theory allows for absolute maximal contextuality ( amc ) if it has ( at least one ) family of experimental scenarios in which @xmath4 approaches @xmath1 . as defined in the abstract",
    ", @xmath2 is a well known graph theoretical invariant , the independence number . for qt",
    ", the tsirelson - like bound @xcite , @xmath3 , also corresponds to a well known graph theoretical invariant @xcite , the so called lovsz number @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to stress that from the complexity theory viewpoint , the quantum bound is an `` easy '' problem ( given a graph @xmath7 , @xmath3 is the solution of a semidefinite program ) , while the noncontextual @xmath2 is a nondeterministic - polynomial - hard ( np - hard ) problem @xcite .",
    "this identification gives a systematic way of exploring the @xmath4 ratio for qt .",
    "we explore its predictions for @xmath8 and examine well - known bell inequalities to get some insight on the behavior of @xmath4 in qt .",
    "this exploration suggests that qt does not allow for amc .",
    "we then present the main result : qt does allow for amc . our proof , however , is not constructive and does not identify specific scenarios . to ease this lack , we present quantum scenarios with almost amc .",
    "we end by discussing why amc is actually possible in qt and suggest that amc is an emerging phenomenon .",
    "the question of how large contextuality can be in qt is very difficult to answer if one adopts the traditional approach within which most measures of contextuality @xcite are defined . by he",
    "traditional approach , we mean that which starts with a previously specified experimental scenario ( i.e. , a number of observables and their relations of co - measurability ) in which we have to obtain the noncontextuality ( nc ) inequalities and compute their maximum quantum violations ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the difficulty is that the number of scenarios is infinite , the number of nc inequalities grows enormously with the number of observables , and the computation of the quantum maxima becomes unfeasible even for relatively simple scenarios .",
    "interestingly , the problem can be addressed by adopting the graph - theoretic approach to quantum contextuality @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "any quantum ( linear ) contextuality witness that can be expressed as a finite sum of probabilities , i.e. , any nc inequality involving a linear combination of probabilities , can be ascribed to a graph with certain properties and , reciprocally , from any graph with these properties one can obtain a quantum contextuality witness of this type .",
    "more precisely , for any given graph @xmath7 , there is always one quantum experiment such that the noncontextual bound is given by the independence number of @xmath7 , @xmath9 ( i.e. , the maximum number of nonadjacent vertices in @xmath7 ) , while the maximum value in qt is given by the lovsz number of @xmath7 , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it is valuable to comment on the generality of this approach .",
    "any tight contextuality witness that is linear in terms of probabilities can be written as a sum @xmath0 of probabilities .",
    "the reasoning is two - fold : first , one can eliminate negative coefficients by changing the probability appearing in each corresponding term by one minus the complementary probabilities ; second , given that all extremal points in the noncontextual set have integer coordinates , the corresponding facets can be written with rational ( and hence integer ) coefficients . the only kind of contextuality witness that is disregarded by this approach is the nonlinear one .",
    "the ratio @xmath11 is a natural measure of quantum contextuality within the graph approach .",
    "in addition , the fact that @xmath11 is a good measure of contextuality can also be justified by appealing to the following betting game ( see also the game proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . consider a bookmaker , bob , that accepts all kinds of bets .",
    "a gambler , alice , brings him a preparation device and a box with a graph @xmath7 drawn at the top and whose properties are described in fig .",
    "the bookmaker can check that both the preparation device and the box work as promised .    at each run",
    ", alice chooses one of the buttons and bets @xmath12 units of money that pressing this button will give the result @xmath13 .",
    "the gain @xmath14 is defined by bob agreeing to pay her @xmath15 units of money , where @xmath16 . as a bookmaker",
    ", bob establishes @xmath14 in order to guarantee his profit after many rounds of the game and to make the betting attractive to alice . denoting her betting probability for button @xmath17 as @xmath18 ,",
    "the expectation of the pay - off is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the probability that pressing the button @xmath17 flashes the green light @xmath13 .",
    "if bob believes that the system is noncontextual , then he will estimate the prize trusting that @xmath21 .",
    "his simplest choice is to estimate the gain as @xmath22^{-1}$ ] , which gives the expected pay - off as @xmath23 , which bob trusts to be less than @xmath13 . for a quantum gambler ,",
    "however , @xmath24 can reach @xmath10 .",
    "this means that a quantum gambler playing against a noncontextual bookmaker is expected to make a profit about @xmath25 per unit of money , per round ( in the limit @xmath26 ) .",
    "here we review what is known about the quantum maximum of @xmath4 for nc and bell inequalities .    for contextuality witness",
    "@xmath0 defined as a sum of @xmath1 probabilities , the quantum maximum of @xmath4 is known for any @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "these quantum contextuality witnesses exist only if @xmath27 @xcite",
    ". then the quantum maxima of @xmath4 are @xmath28 for @xmath29 , @xmath30 for @xmath31 , @xmath32 for @xmath33 , and @xmath34 for @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "still , any of these maxima is very far from the values required for the amc . for explicit families of nc inequalities with increasing number of settings",
    "@xcite , the distance to the amc is indeed growing with the number of settings .",
    "bell inequalities violated by qt are also quantum contextuality witnesses .",
    "the advantage with respect to nc inequalities is that , unlike nc inequalities , bell inequalities have been extensively studied for years and many results and examples for the growth of the ratio @xmath36 between the quantum and noncontextual ( i.e. , local ) bounds are known , because this ratio usually measures the quantum vs classical advantage for certain tasks involving separated parties . here",
    "we present a brief overview of such results ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) and explain how these results are connected to our problem . for our purposes , @xmath36 will play the role of @xmath4 and , hereafter , @xmath37 will be the number of parties , @xmath38 the dimension ( of at least one ) of the local subsystems , @xmath39 the number of settings per party , and @xmath40 the number of outputs , while @xmath1 is the number of probabilities in the contextuality witness @xmath0 .    in a pioneering work",
    ", tsirelson @xcite showed that , for bipartite bell inequalities , @xmath36 is upper bounded by the real grothendieck constant @xmath41 @xcite , whose exact value is unknown ( but bounds are known ) . in the multipartite case , the first investigations focused on @xmath36 for particularly promising quantum states .",
    "for example , for tripartite greenberger - horne - zeilinger states , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the complex grothendiek constant ( whose exact value is also unknown ) . for schmidt states , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "similar results hold for clique - wise entangled states and , in particular , for stabilizer states @xcite .",
    "better results where found with the help of the probabilistic method . in the tripartite scenario it is possible to prove , for every @xmath46 , the existence of quantum violations with @xmath47 , with @xmath48 @xcite . however , this result is highly nonconstructive and there is no estimate for @xmath49 ( the dimension of the other two subsystems ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors show that there are tripartite bell inequalities for which @xmath50 , for some constant @xmath51 , while @xmath52 , improving the previous result .",
    "there is a general result which provides an upper bound for @xmath36 for tripartite correlation bell inequalities . in refs .",
    "@xcite it is proven that , for this case , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 . in this case ,",
    "a generalization of this result to @xmath37 parties shows that @xmath56 , with @xmath39 settings for at least @xmath57 parties @xcite . in this case ,",
    "both results are also nonconstructive and there are no explicit examples approaching these bounds . for these nonconstructive results ,",
    "@xmath1 is a loose estimative , since many bell inequalities involve only a fraction of the @xmath59 probabilities .    for a large number @xmath37 of parties ,",
    "large violations can be obtained already in the simpler scenario with two settings per party . for the inequalities connected with xor games , which include the werner - wolf - ukowski - brukner inequalities @xcite , @xmath60 can be found for some particular inequalities , including the mermin inequalities @xcite .",
    "this value is optimal for this scenario . in this case ,",
    "@xmath61 .    for general bipartite inequalities , @xmath62 , with @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "in this case , @xmath64 . if @xmath65 , there are bell inequalities with @xmath66 . in this case , @xmath67 @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors prove the existence of bell inequalities with @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .",
    "there are no explicit examples achieving these bounds .",
    "also in these cases large violations can be obtained but at the expense of increasing exponentially @xmath1 .    in the case of general bipartite bell inequalities ,",
    "two important explicit examples are shown in ref .",
    "the first one is the family of inequalities associated with the hidden matching game , which has @xmath70 for @xmath71 , which gives a superexponential @xmath1 .",
    "the second example is the family of inequalities associated with the khot - vishnoi game , with @xmath72 , with @xmath73 , which also gives a superexponential @xmath1 . to our knowledge",
    ", the growth of @xmath36 for bell inequalities with three or more parties remains unexplored .    as we see , none of these quantum violations of nc or bell inequalities even remotely suggest that qt might allow for amc .",
    "despite what is suggested by all previous evidence , the following theorem holds :    _ theorem 1 .",
    "_ quantum theory allows for absolute maximal contextuality .    _ proof . _ the proof is based on two previous results . in ref .  @xcite it is shown that , for any @xmath1-vertex graph @xmath7 such that @xmath74 , there is a quantum contextuality witness @xmath0 such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the noncontextual and quantum tight maximum of @xmath0 .",
    "its physical implementation requires us to prepare a quantum state in the handle of a lovsz - optimum orthogonal representation of the complement of the graph and to measure the rank - one projectors onto the unit vectors of that representation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "therefore , proving the existence of scenarios of amc requires proving the existence of graphs such that @xmath11 approaches @xmath1 .",
    "reference @xcite proves that , for every @xmath16 , an @xmath1-vertex graph @xmath7 exists such that @xmath75 .    the proof in ref .",
    "@xcite uses the probabilistic method and no explicit construction approaching these values is known . therefore , although the existence of scenarios allowing for amc in qt is guaranteed by the result in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can not present any explicit example . to ease this problem ,",
    "we present some additional results .",
    "first , notice that , if we fix @xmath76 , then there is a limit for @xmath11 .",
    "specifically , the following theorem holds :    _ theorem 2 .",
    "_ for every @xmath77 there exists an absolute constant @xmath78 such that , for any @xmath1-vertex graph @xmath7 with @xmath79 , @xmath80 .    the proof is based on theorem 5.1 in ref .",
    "@xcite , which generalizes a result in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath81 , for which @xmath82 .    although there are no explicit constructions for general @xmath83 , in ref .",
    "@xcite there is a family of graphs with @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "these graphs depend on a parameter @xmath86 which can not be a multiple of @xmath87 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath88 . for @xmath89",
    ", it is a graph with @xmath90 vertices such that its complement is the graph consisting of @xmath91 unconnected squares . in this particular case ,",
    "@xmath92 , therefore it is not a quantum contextuality witness .",
    "the interesting thing is that it gives us some intuition about how the graphs corresponding to amc may be : dense graphs ( i.e. , with a number of edges close to the maximal number of edges ) with a very high number of vertices .",
    "we have also computed the adjacency matrix for the complement of the graph for @xmath93 .",
    "it has over two million edges .",
    "we do not know whether or not the cases @xmath94 are quantum contextuality witnesses . however , this is the case for @xmath95 .",
    "these graphs are cayley graphs @xcite and , therefore , regular and vertex - transitive .    alternatively ,",
    "if we do not fix @xmath9 , then we can obtain larger violations with simpler graphs for which the number of vertices does not grow so fast .",
    "_ theorem 3 .",
    "_ for every @xmath16 there is an explicit family of graphs for which @xmath96 and @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "the proof is based on theorem 6.1 in ref .  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , there are explicit quantum contextuality witnesses reaching these values . for a pair of integers @xmath99",
    ", @xmath100 is the graph on @xmath101 vertices , with each vertex corresponding to a @xmath102-subset of @xmath103 , and such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if their intersection has exactly @xmath104 elements . for small values of @xmath102 and @xmath104",
    "we have :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tablei ]    for this family , there are explicit orthonormal representations @xcite that achieve the lower bound on @xmath3 in dimension @xmath105 .",
    "each of these orthonormal representation provides the measurements ( the rank - one projectors onto the unit vectors of the representation ) and the quantum state ( the handle of the representation ) for an experimental implementation of a quantum contextuality witness .",
    "contextuality is an important resource for computation and communication . so far ,",
    "a given experimental scenario was said to exhibit maximal contextuality when the maximum possible violation @xmath3 of the corresponding noncontextual bound @xmath2 was the maximum allowed by some principles .",
    "this approach motivated the definition of , e.g. , `` fully contextual correlations '' as those in which @xmath3 equals the nonsignaling bound @xcite .",
    "recent developments @xcite suggest that qt could be maximally contextual in the sense that the contextuality of specific scenarios can be explained by embedding them into larger maximally contextual scenarios . however , this still does not answer the question of how large quantum contextuality can be .    here",
    "we investigated whether qt achieves the maximum conceivable contextuality .",
    "previous evidence , including the quantum violation of nc and bell inequalities , strongly suggested against that possibility .",
    "surprisingly , in qt , there are scenarios in which the ratio @xmath4 can be arbitrarily close to its absolute maximum .",
    "how this may happen ?",
    "unfortunately , our proof is not constructive and does not allow us to identify explicit scenarios .",
    "however , the examples of almost amc that we found , when examined from the point of view of their quantum realization , have in common the presence of a very large set of rank - one projectors such that almost everyone commutes with everyone ( suggesting , when coarse grained , a classical system of high dimensionality ) , but at the same time riddled with a large number small `` islands '' of projectors such that not all of them commute ( suggesting , when fine grained , a strong quantum behavior ) .",
    "this supports the view that quantum amc is an emerging phenomenon that only occurs when small quantum structures infest in a particular way seemingly classical and highly complex systems .",
    "a natural open problem is therefore to learn more about these scenarios . on the technical side ,",
    "the difficulty to identify them is related to the difficulty of identifying graphs with large @xmath11 due to the fact that @xmath9 is hard to compute and is only known for very restricted families of graphs . a possible strategy to address",
    "this problem would be to single out graph invariants computable in polynomial time [ like @xmath10 ] and sandwiched between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and then identify graphs with a large ratio between this quantity and @xmath10 .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors present a semidefinite program ( sdp ) approximation for @xmath9 which is at least as good as @xmath10 .",
    "many approximations are also known @xcite , including many sdp hierarchies that converge in a finite number of steps @xcite .",
    "each of them provides other sdp approximations to @xmath9 , and , if smaller than @xmath10 , can be used to lower bound the contextuality . from the conceptual point of view",
    ", even if the simplest scenarios with quantum amc are so complex that they do not allow for experimental tests using present technologies , it seems to be important to understand how amc emerges , what implications amc has ( in particular , for the limits of the contextuality of simple scenarios ) , and what amc may be useful for .",
    "finally , another important question is which is the maximum nonlocality allowed by qt .",
    "this problem has been only studied for fixed scenarios and has been proven hard even in the simplest scenarios .",
    "the quest for maximum nonlocality with no restriction on the scenario is much harder .",
    "however , the same way the graph - theoretic approach to quantum contextuality @xcite has been useful to answer the question of what is the maximum contextuality in qt , the multigraph approach of ref .",
    "@xcite may help to address the question of which is the maximum nonlocality in qt .",
