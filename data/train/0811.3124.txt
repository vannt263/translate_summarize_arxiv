    "ever since the soai reaction , first published some years ago @xcite , there has been an ever increasing number of researchers inspired by this important landmark experiment , who have been searching for other reactions capable of exhibiting the spontaneous emergence of chiral asymmetry in closed systems . at present , there is a gradual and mounting experimental evidence in favor of this @xcite , showing that absolute asymmetric synthesis @xcite is possible for autocatalytic reaction networks in closed mass reacting systems and even suggests that chiral amplification could occur in chemical equilibrium scenarios @xcite . on the theoretical side , kinetic schemes which are extensions of the elemental frank model @xcite ,",
    "are able to reproduce the main features of the mirror symmetry breaking behavior of the soai reaction @xcite .",
    "the key ingredients of theoretical models of mirror - symmetry breaking processes in chemistry @xcite include reactions in which the chiral products serve as catalysts to produce more of themselves while inhibiting the production of their enantiomer or mirror - image counterparts .",
    "the two basic models we analyze here differ in the way this inhibition is produced .",
    "frank s original model @xcite , involves the autocatalysis of the two enantiomers , denoted herewith as l and d , and mutual inhibition or antagonistic effects between the two chiral species .",
    "this mutual inhibition occurs through the formation of heterodimers that are removed from the reacting system . in the case of limited enantioselectivity @xcite",
    ", the required antagonism arises through the recycling of an enantiomeric pair of monomers back to a single chiral monomer and a prochiral substrate molecule .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to determine the stability of the steady states for various reaction schemes that have been proposed as models for mirror symmetry breaking in chemistry .",
    "this requires knowledge of only the static solutions of the kinetic equations .",
    "then , differential equations for the arbitrary time - dependent fluctuations about these final static solutions are straightforward to derive to first order in the fluctuations .",
    "these time dependent fluctuation equations are expressed in matrix form , and the eigenvalues of the corresponding matrix , evaluated on the static solutions obtained previously , signal unambiguously the stability ( or instability ) of the racemic or chiral solution under study . here",
    "we are interested in understanding the chemical factors controlling the symmetry breaking transition from a racemic ( equal proportions of the left and right - handed molecules ) to chiral states , the latter characterized by unequal proportions of the two enantiomers . for each model considered , we identify the critical parameter that controls the transition from racemic to chiral states .",
    "these dimensionless parameters are expressed as simple ratios of the chemical reaction rates .",
    "when the control parameter falls below a critical value , then chiral amplification results . in the latter case , the racemic state is unstable , and an initial small perturbation is sufficient to tip the system over into one of its two equally likely stable chiral states .",
    "exactly equal proportions of the two chiral enantiomers never occur in practice , and this inevitable chiral imbalance yields an initial statistical enantiomeric excess @xcite .",
    "moreoever , in imperfectly mixed spatially extended systems , diffusion - limited noise is intrinsic to the reacting and diffusing system itself and is sufficient to drive the symmetry breaking @xcite . in either case , the noise need not be put in _ a - posteriori_.    first the study of open systems at constant concentration of the achiral reactants is carried out .",
    "open systems provide a clear insight to the chemical conditions necessary to achieve spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking ; as we will show , the critical parameter for the bifurcation behavior in a closed system is concentration dependent .",
    "the calculation of the eigenvalues in the closed system case are generally more difficult to obtain and in many cases , they can not be expressed in a manageable analytic form .",
    "the reaction schemes analyzed below correspond in the most part to _ reversible _ chemical reactions , in contrast to the irreversible soai reaction .",
    "the results obtained here should be of practical value to aid in the search for new reactions exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking which might eventually provide valuable insight to the much more difficult problem of the origin of biological chirality @xcite .",
    "the importance of cyclic catalytic reactions as conditions for life is elegantly argued in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . after introducing the general reaction scheme in sec [ sec : mainmodel ]",
    ", we consider open flow systems , and use the constancy of the prochiral substrate to cast the kinetic equations in dimensionless form in sec [ sec : opensys ] .",
    "this has the advantage of reducing the number of parameters and allows for all results to be expressed in terms of _ ratios _ of the rate constants .",
    "this is a most welcome feature when calculating solutions and the corresponding eigenvalues of the stability matrix .",
    "the stability properties of a sequence of frank - type models followed by models with limited enantioselectivity are presented in sec [ sec : stability ] .",
    "the symmetry breaking in all these models yields the classic bifurcation diagram which we illustrate for the limited enantioselectivity model .",
    "for closed systems , a different rescaling of time and the concentrations is needed to obtain dimensionless kinetic equations .",
    "the constant mass constraint makes the algebraic analysis in this case much more involved , and a few particularizations of the general reaction scheme are treated in sec [ sec : closedsystems ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the general system we will study for spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking is that defined by eqs.([decay]-[heterodim ] ) below and it implies the following four pairs of reactions : a straight non - catalyzed reaction eq.([decay ] ) , enantioselective autocatalysis eq.([autold2 ] ) , and a non - enantioselective autocatalysis eq.([nonenantiosel ] ) , where a is a prochiral starting product , and l and d are the two enantiomers of the chiral product .",
    "we also assume reversible homo- and heterodimerization steps in eqs.([homodim],[heterodim ] ) ; @xmath0 represent the two chiral enantiomeric homodimers and ld is the diastereomeric , achiral heterodimer .",
    "the @xmath1 denote the reaction rate constants .",
    "production of chiral compound : @xmath2    autocatalytic production : @xmath3    limited enantioselectivity : @xmath4    homo - dimerizations : @xmath5 hetero - dimerization : @xmath6 we assume for all reaction steps the feasibility of the reverse reaction , and that the reaction rates are the same for each pair of enantiomeric reactions eqs.([decay]-[homodim ] ) .",
    "notice that this would not be the case in the presence of an external chiral polarization field , or for an internal bias of non - chemical origin , such as the weak nuclear force @xcite , for then @xmath7 .",
    "this reaction scheme leads to the following differential equations for the concentrations in the mean field limit : @xmath8 & = & k_1[a ] + ( k_2[a]-k_{-1})[l]-k_{-2}[l]^2 - k_{-3}[l][d ] + k_3[a][d ] -2k_4[l]^2 + 2k_{-4}[l_2]\\nonumber \\\\ & - & k_5[l][d ] + k_{-5}[ld ] , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\label{eqnbb } \\frac{d}{d t}[d ] & = & k_1[a ] + ( k_2[a]-k_{-1})[d ] -k_{-2}[d]^2 -k_{-3}[d][l ] + k_3[a][l ] -2k_4[d]^2 + 2k_{-4}[d_2]\\nonumber \\\\ & - & k_5[d][l ] + k_{-5}[ld ] , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\frac{d}{dt}[a ] & = & -2k_1[a]-(k_2[a]+k_3[a ] -k_{-1})([l]+[d])+ k_{-2}([l]^2 + [ d]^2 ) + 2k_{-3}[l][d],\\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{d}{d t}[l_2 ] & = & k_4[l]^2 - k_{-4}[l_2 ] , \\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{d}{d t}[d_2 ] & = & k_4[d]^2 - k_{-4}[d_2 ] , \\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{d}{d t}[ld ] & = & k_5[l][d ] - k_{-5}[ld ] . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the other important feature that relates our work to experimental chemical systems is the inclusion of both the forward @xmath1 , and the reverse @xmath9 reaction rates , despite the fact that for some rate constants one has @xmath10 .",
    "this inclusion is necessary because these rates determine the thermodynamic conditions , i.e. , the principle of detailed balance , microscopic reversibility ; see for example the final paragraph of section d",
    "the other experimental condition that comes into play is the distinction between open and closed systems .",
    "open flow is traditionally invoked for maintaining the non - equilibrium state . in these models , this is achieved by providing the system with a continuous input flow of achiral precursers a and an output flow of certain products ( such as the heterodimers p in the classic frank model ) .",
    "openess for chemical systems is can not be applied to recent experimental reports on the chemical bench ( i.e. , the soai reaction ) .",
    "closed on the other hand , refers to systems of constant mass where only energy can be exchanged with the exterior : the start from an initial state far from equilibrium to the final composition state is a real representation of a chemical reaction carried out in the laboratory .",
    "here we consider reactions that take place in an open system .",
    "open here specifically means that the system can exchange the substrate a with an external source , and thus we take the concentration @xmath11 $ ] as a constant .",
    "this is also in keeping with the original formulation of the frank model @xcite .",
    "so we impose this condition and work out the consequences for a sequence of models starting from the frank model itself .",
    "it proves convenient to use this constant concentration to define a simple transformation to dimensionless rates , time and concentrations .",
    "we take @xmath12-k_{-1})t$ ] for the time parameter and @xmath13 = \\frac{k_{-3 } + k_5}{k_2[a]-k_{-1}}[l]$ ] , etc . for the dimensionless concentrations .",
    "this allows us to express the above rate equations in pure dimensionless form : @xmath14 & = & u + [ \\tilde l ] - g[\\tilde l]^2 -[\\tilde l][\\tilde d ] + w[\\tilde d ] + 2p[\\tilde l_2 ] + r[\\tilde{ld } ] , \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eqntild } \\frac{d}{d \\tau}[\\tilde d ] & = & u + [ \\tilde d ] - g[\\tilde d]^2 -[\\tilde d][\\tilde l ] + w[\\tilde l ] + 2p[\\tilde d_2 ] + r[\\tilde{ld } ] , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "\\frac{d}{d \\tau}[\\tilde d_2 ] & = & \\frac{q}{2}[\\tilde d]^2 - p[\\tilde d_2 ] , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\frac{d}{d \\tau}[\\tilde{ld } ] & = & s[\\tilde l][\\tilde d ] - r[\\tilde{ld } ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dimensionless parameters appearing here are : @xmath15(k_{-3}+k_5)}{(k_2[a]-k_{-1})^2},\\,\\ , g = \\frac{k_{-2}+ 2k_4}{k_{-3}+k_5 } , \\,\\ , w=\\frac{k_3[a]}{(k_2[a]-k_{-1 } ) } , \\,\\ , p = \\frac{k_{-4}}{(k_2[a]-k_{-1 } ) } , \\\\\\label{openparams2 } r & = & \\frac{k_{-5}}{(k_2[a]-k_{-1 } ) } , \\,\\,q = \\frac{2k_{4}}{(k_{-3}+ k_5 ) } , \\,\\ , { \\rm and } \\,\\ , s= \\frac{k_{5}}{(k_{-3}+ k_5)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note we have succeeded in reducing the number of parameters from ten to seven .",
    "these latter seven parameters fully determine the dynamics of the kinetic scheme .",
    "we will see below that @xmath16 plays a privileged role .",
    "depending on whether @xmath16 is greater or less than a certain critical value @xmath17 , then either the racemic or chiral solutions will be stable , respectively .",
    "thus we already see the relative influence that the homo ( @xmath18 ) and heterodimerizations ( @xmath19 ) will have on the final outcome as well as the relative influence of the _ reverse _ autocatalytic ( @xmath20 ) and limited enantioselective steps ( @xmath21 ) . from the denominator of @xmath16 , we see that the chiral antagonism proceeds via two independent pathways : either through the formation of heterodimers @xmath22 , or via the recycling of an enantiomeric pair of monomers back to a single chiral monomer and the prochiral substrate @xmath23 .    to cast the equations in their final form ,",
    "we next define sums and differences of the ( dimensionless ) monomer and the homodimer concentrations .",
    "thus , we will put @xmath24 + [ \\tilde d]$ ] , @xmath25 + [ \\tilde d_2]$ ] , @xmath26 - [ \\tilde d]$ ] , @xmath27 - [ \\tilde d_2]$ ] , and @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "this then yields the following : @xmath29 the fixed points of these equations correspond to the _ final _ asymptotic ( as @xmath30 ) solutions of the kinetic model . substituting @xmath31 , etc . into the set of eqs.([chi]-[p ] ) where @xmath32 denotes a fixed point solution",
    ", we obtain differential equations for the arbitrary perturbations @xmath33 about the fixed point .",
    "then , the following jacobian matrix @xmath34 governs the time dependence of these perturbations to first order @xmath35 in the fluctuations : @xmath36 this matrix is to be evaluated on any one of the static fixed - point solutions @xmath37 of the equation set eqs.([chi]-[p ] ) .",
    "the associated eigenvalues indicate the stability of the specific static solution on which @xmath34 is evaluated .",
    "the eigenvalues of this jacobian are expressed in terms of dimensionless ratios of specific chemical reaction rates , thus , the positivity or negativity of the individual eigenvalues can be ascertained straightforwardly in terms of the specific chemical parameters .",
    "this provides another clear connection with the experimental conditions : the relative rates of certain reactions will determine whether the final outcome is a chiral or racemic solution . of course , here we treat the @xmath38 s as variables in order to analyze all possibilities of chemical @xmath38 rates .",
    "thus all cases for different values and relationships between rate constants are taken into account in our analysis : this allows us to characterize the stable final states for reversible and quasi reversible , and also irreversible , synthetic chemical reactions formed by the reaction networks analyzed .",
    "these are the most widely studied as complex chemical systems capable of leading to spontaneous symmetry breaking in previous works . in practice , the rate constants can be determined experimentally in the laboratory , such methods are explained in detail in textbooks @xcite .",
    "first consider the frank model as determined by the kinetic scheme eqs.([decay],[autold2],[heterodim ] ) .",
    "see , for example the definition as given in @xcite .",
    "the concentration @xmath11 $ ] of the achiral substrate is taken as constant .",
    "there is a reversible catalytic production of the monomers .",
    "the heterodimers @xmath39 $ ] , formed irreversibly ( @xmath40 ) from the mutual inhibition step , are to be eliminated from the system as a kind of inactive side product . the production step eq.([decay ] ) is typically ignored ( we will however consider its effect below ) .",
    "this situation corresponds then to the reaction steps eqs.([autold2],[heterodim ] ) , and we are to solve the equations eqs.([chi],[y ] ) after setting @xmath41 .",
    "there are four fixed points or static solutions : @xmath42 @xmath43 denotes the empty solution , that is , with zero chiral matter , @xmath44 is the racemic solution with positive net total chiral matter , and @xmath45 denote the two possible chiral solutions . from eq.([openparams1 ] ) we see that @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    in order to study the stability of the four possible homogeneous solutions",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath45 , we calculate the eigenvalues of the @xmath49 subblock of the upper left hand corner of the jacobian matrix eq.([mopen ] ) ( after first setting @xmath50 there ) evaluated at each one of the above four solutions eqs .",
    "( [ franksolu0 ] ) .",

    ", we set @xmath62 .",
    "but then eq.([heterodim ] ) for @xmath63 is not independent from eqs.([decay],[autold2 ] ) : we solve for @xmath64 and then deduce @xmath63 .",
    "the above steady state solutions eq.([franksolu0 ] ) and corresponding eigenvalues eqs.([frankeigou0]-[frankeigqu0 ] ) are identical for either situation .",
    "we now allow for @xmath65 and determine the effect that the direct monomer production step eq.([decay ] ) has on the solutions , and their stability properties .",
    "the four static solutions are now given by @xmath66 it is easy to see that these tend to the solutions in eq([franksolu0 ] ) in the limit as @xmath67 . here",
    "@xmath68 denotes the _ unphysical _ solution , since the total concentration of chiral matter is negative @xmath69 .",
    "the eigenvalues are given by @xmath70 in the @xmath67 limit these eigenvalues tend those listed in eqs.([frankeigou0]-[frankeigqu0 ] ) .",

    "the monomer production step thus reduces the range of @xmath16 for which stable mirror symmetry breaking can occur , and the chiral solutions are no longer homochiral .",
    "what happens if the heterodimers are _ not _ removed from the system , but are allowed to remain evolving dynamically in concert with the monomers ?",
    "this situation corresponds to all three reaction steps eqs.([decay],[autold2],[heterodim ] ) , and we solve the three equations eqs.([chi],[y],[p ] ) after setting @xmath85 and @xmath47 . to keep the algebra manageable",
    ", we also will set @xmath86 .",
    "there are four static solutions : @xmath87 note that the final heterodimer concentration @xmath63 is _ zero _ in the chiral states @xmath45 .",
    "in order to study the stability of the four possible homogeneous solutions @xmath48 and @xmath45 , we calculate the eigenvalues of the @xmath88 array obtained from eq.([mopen ] ) after deleting the 3rd and 4rth rows and columns .",

    "if heterodimers can form , it is certainly reasonable to expect the same for homodimers .",
    "this corresponds to the reaction steps eqs.([decay],[autold2],[homodim],[heterodim ] ) , and we must solve all five equations eqs.([chi],[y],[chi2],[y2],[p ] ) after setting @xmath50 and @xmath47 . to help maintain algebraic control , we also will set @xmath86 .",

    "we point out however , that if the heterodimers are formed _ irreversibly _",
    "@xmath105 , then a stable homochiral outcome is again possible whenever @xmath106 .    to summarize up to this point",
    ", the sequence of frank type models analyzed above indicates that the elimination of the heterodimers from the system ( when @xmath11 $ ] is constant ) , or their irreversible formation , is crucial in order that symmetry breaking be possible and that the chirally asymmetric states be stable . allowing for homodimer formation does not alter the stability properties .",
    "see also the first four rows of table [ tab : table1 ] .      whereas the forward reactions in eq.([autold2 ] ) represent the autocatalytic capabilities of each enantiomer , the forward reaction in eq.([nonenantiosel ] ) accounts for the fact that an enantiomer can also catalyze the production of its chiral partner .",
    "this scenario , corresponding to the reaction steps eqs.([decay],[autold2],[nonenantiosel ] ) , is termed _ limited enantioselectivity _ @xcite . as there is no dimerization in this model , we are to solve eqs.([chi],[y ] ) in which we set @xmath107 . in this case , the four static solutions are ( note we also set @xmath86 to help simplify the algebra ) : @xmath108 @xmath43 denotes the empty solution , that is , with zero chiral matter , @xmath44 is the racemic solution with positive net total chiral matter , and @xmath45 denote the two possible chiral solutions .",

    "when this holds , the final enantiomeric excess @xmath83 will be given by @xmath114 and so @xmath115 , which means that the chiral solution is not homochiral .",
    "this symmetry breaking can be represented via a corresponding bifurcation diagram , see fig [ bifurc ] . when @xmath116 only the racemic state is stable , and @xmath117 , but when @xmath118 two stable chirally asymmetric states are equally likely , which one the system actually chooses is a random event .",
    "the upper and lower branches of the bifurcation are given by plotting the values of @xmath83 , eq.([eeopen ] ) as a function of @xmath16 holding @xmath119 fixed .",
    "in summary , there is a critical value of the parameter , @xmath120 that uniquely determines the outcome of the reaction scheme .",

    "@xmath121 i.e. @xmath122=[d]$ ] , i.e. we have a _ racemic _ solution .",

    "the results of these latter two cases are summarized in the seventh and eighth rows of table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "it is interesting to point out that although the expressions for the critical @xmath16 s depend on the homo and heterodimer rates explicitly and in a non - trivial way ( see the third column ) , the final inequalities @xmath132 determining the stable chiral outcomes are the same as for limited enantioselectivity alone , irrespective of whether the homo and/or heterodimers are included .",
    "compare the fifth and seventh rows of the table , as well as the sixth and eighth rows .",

    "note from eq.([paramsclosed ] ) we have @xmath186 .",
    "the stability of the four possible homogeneous solutions @xmath187 and @xmath45 , is determined from considering the eigenvalues of the @xmath49 subblock of the upper left hand corner of the jacobian matrix @xmath153 eq.([mclosed ] ) ( and after setting @xmath188 as well as @xmath86 ) evaluated at each one of these four possible solutions .",
    "the eigenvalues are given by    @xmath189    @xmath190    and @xmath191 as @xmath192 , the unphysical solution @xmath68 is therefore always unstable .",
    "to ensure the stability in @xmath44 , we need for both eigenvalues to be negative : @xmath52 .",
    "while the second eigenvalue is always negative , we have @xmath193 if and only if @xmath194 , where @xmath195 a careful expansion of this shows that in the limit of large @xmath148 , then the critical value of @xmath16 @xmath196 asymptotically approaches the critical @xmath16 for the same set of reactions in an open system , eq.([gcritopen ] ) .",
    "concerning the stability of the solutions @xmath45 , these are always unstable if @xmath55 and they become stable @xmath197 for @xmath198 . however , the thermodynamic condition mentioned above still holds and implies that the racemic state is the only stable outcome .",
    "we have focussed attention on the steady state solutions and their dynamic stability properties in variants of both the frank and limited enantioselectivity models of mirror symmetry breaking . in the frank model @xcite",
    ", the mutual inhibition occurs through the formation of heterodimers composed of the two chiral monomers , whereas in limited enantioselectivity @xcite , the needed chiral antagonism occurs though a monomer recycling reaction .",
    "we have unified both models into one encompassing reaction scheme and have studied the steady state solutions and their stability properties in a sequence of reaction schemes that start from the paradigmatic frank model to limited enantioselectivity , in which we study the consequences of including the formation of ( reversible ) hetero- and homo - dimers as dynamic variable concentrations in both .",
    "the general conclusion we can draw from this is that the inclusion of the variable heterodimer concentrations leads to a final stable racemic state in the sequence of frank - type models defined above .",
    "this is important because we recall that in frank s original formulation , the heterodimers are supposed to be _ removed _ from the system , i.e. , their formation is irreversible . including the homodimers",
    "does not affect this conclusion .    in the case of the limited enantioselectivity model , no dimer formation",
    "is originally contemplated , and mirror symmetry breaking is _ mathematically _ possible because the needed inhibition is provided by the reverse symmetric catalysis step @xcite . in spite of this , the symmetry breaking condition @xmath132 ,",
    "determined from the pure stability analysis , can not be achieved on thermodynamic grounds @xcite , as has also been pointed out recently @xcite . including the homo- and/or the heterodimer formation to limited enantioselectivity does not alter the crucial inequality , nor does the presence of the dimers change the thermodynamic constraint .",
    "therefore an open question is if a different chemical scenario leading to collective phenomena exists , such as a second order phase transition , that can give rise to the condition @xmath132 . in the context of spatially extended polymerization systems , it has been argued before that one should expect domain formation similar to the case of second order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the reaction networks treated here are limited to reactions involving only monomers and dimers , whereas biological chirality of living systems involves large macromolecules that are probably the result of polimerization reactions . in this vein , sandars recently introduced a model in which the detailed polymerization process and enantiomeric cross - inhibition are taken into account , its basic features are explored numerically , but without including spatial extent , chiral bias or noise @xcite .",
    "brandenburg and coworkers have analyzed further properties of sandars model and have proposed a truncated version including chiral bias @xcite , and have studied this reduction with spatial extent and coupling to a turbulent advection velocity @xcite .",
    "gleiser and thorarinson analyze the reduced sandars model with spatial extent and coupling to an external white noise @xcite and in @xcite , gleiser considers the reduced chiral biased model with external noise .",
    "in addition to sandars , both wattis and coveney @xcite and saito and hyuga @xcite have introduced polymerization models that can give rise to homochiral states .",
    "the latter one differs from sandars in allowing for reversibility in all the steps . as reported in the review article ( d ) in @xcite",
    ", all these polymerization models derive from frank s model by adding polymerization reactions .",
    "thus , in spite of the simplicity of the original frank model @xcite , ignoring as it does the polymerization process , it continues to serve as a type of  ising model \" for chiral symmetry breaking .",
