    "dwarf novae are non - magnetic cataclysmic variables , which are close binary systems containing white dwarf primary and roche lobe filling secondary .",
    "the secondary is typically a low mass main sequence star , which loses its material through the inner lagrangian point .",
    "this material forms an accretion disc around a white dwarf ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "one of the most intriguing classes of dwarf novae are su uma stars which have short orbital periods ( less than 2.5 hours ) and show two types of outbursts : normal outbursts and superoutbursts .",
    "superoutbursts are typically about one magnitude brighter than normal outbursts , occur about ten times less frequently and display characteristic tooth - shape light modulations with a period a few percent longer than the orbital period of the binary .",
    "the behavior of su uma stars in now well understood within the frame of the thermal - tidal instability model ( see osaki 1996 for review ) .",
    "superhumps occur at a period slightly longer than the orbital period of the binary system .",
    "they are most probably the result of accretion disc precession caused by gravitational perturbations from the secondary .",
    "these perturbations are most effective when disc particles moving in eccentric orbits enter the 3:1 resonance .",
    "then the superhump period is simply the beat period between orbital and precession rate periods .    over ten years ago , the diversity of behavior observed in cataclysmic variables seemed to be quite small .",
    "these variables were classified into few distinct groups which were clearly visible in the @xmath9 diagram ( see for example fig .",
    "3 of osaki 1996 ) .",
    "there is a group of su uma stars located below the period gap . at longer orbital periods one can find three other groups : u gem , z cam and nova - like stars , listed according to increasing @xmath10 .    at the beginning of the 1990s ,",
    "the situation started to be more complicated .",
    "the systems showing superhumps were divided into four subgroups :    * ordinary su uma stars , * permanent superhumpers - high accretion rate systems permanently in superoutbursts ( skillman and patterson 1993 ) , * wz sge stars , characterized by an extremely long quiescent state , going into superoutburst every @xmath1110 years and showing no or infrequent ordinary outbursts , * er uma stars - systems characterized by an extremely short supercycle ( 20 - 60 days ) , a short interval between normal outbursts ( 3 - 4 days ) and small amplitude ( 3 mag ) of superoutbursts ( kato and kunjaya 1995 , robertson et al . 1995 )    there are only five known er uma stars : er uma itself ( kato and kunjaya 1995 , robertson et al .",

    "1995 , nogami et al .",
    "1995 ) , di uma ( kato et al . 1996 ) and ix dra ( ishioka et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the most poorly observed object in this group is ix dra , thus we decided to include it in the list of stars observed within the curious variables experiment ( olech et al .",
    "2003a , b ) . here",
    "we report the results of a five month observational campaign performed in 2003 .",
    "the variability of ix dra was discovered by noguchi et al .",
    "the light curve obtained by klose ( 1995 ) allowed him to determine the amplitude of light variations as equal to 3.5 mag and its period as equal to 45.7 days .",
    "these properties indicated that the star could be a cv system and thus ix dra was classified as u gem - type variable in the cv catalog of downes et al .",
    "this classification was confirmed by spectroscopic observations of liu et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "ix dra was extensively observed in 2000 - 2001 by ishioka et al .",
    "their observations revealed that the star is a member of the er uma - type group of variables , having a supercycle length of 53 days ; an interval of normal outbursts of 3 - 4 days ; a duty cycle @xmath12% and an outburst amplitude of 2.5 mag . from time - series observations during the superoutbursts",
    ", they obtained a presumable superhump period of 0.067 days .",
    "observations of ix dra reported in the present paper were obtained during 46 nights between june 24 , 2003 and november 22 , 2003 at the ostrowik station of the warsaw university observatory .",
    "the data were collected using the 60-cm cassegrain telescope equipped with a tektronics tk512cb back - illuminated ccd camera .",
    "the scale of the camera was 0.76\" / pixel providing a 6.5@xmath136.5 field of view .",
    "the full description of the telescope and camera was given by udalski and pych ( 1992 ) .",
    "we monitored the star in `` white light '' in order to be able to observe it also at minimum light of around 17.5 mag .",
    "the exposure times were from 90 to 180 seconds during the bright state and from 150 to 350 seconds at minimum light .",
    "a full journal of our ccd observations of ix dra is given in table 1 . in total , we monitored the star for 141 hours and obtained 2759 exposures .",
    ".journal of the ccd observations of ix dra .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , > , > \" , ]     the least squares linear fit to the data from table 3 gives the following ephemeris for the minima :    @xmath14    the @xmath15 values computed according to the ephemeris ( 1 ) are listed in table 3 and also shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that there is no trace of period change , thus we conclude that period of the superhumps during 2003 september superoutburst of ix dra was constant and its value was @xmath16 days .      knowing the period of superhumps we can phase the nightly light curves from superoutburst to trace the superhump profile changes .",
    "the result of such an operation is shown in fig .",
    "phase 0.0 corresponds to a deep minimum in the light curve .",
    "it is clear that at the beginning of superoutburst , the star displayed large - amplitude tooth - shape superhumps with no secondary maxima .",
    "one night later , the amplitude significantly decreased , and secondary maxima became visible .",
    "on sep 22 , the amplitude of secondary humps increased , and on sep 24 they became higher than the main maxima .",
    "the situation repeated on nights sep 25 and sep 26 .",
    "such an unexpected phase reversal of maxima during the very early stage ( only five days after the superoutburst maximum ) was also observed in another star from the er uma subgroup - er uma itself ( kato et al .",
    "it was interpreted as a sudden switch to so - called late superhumps usually occurring during late stages of superoutburst in ordinary su uma stars . as we will see later , the origin of this phase reversal has a completely different source .",
    "from each light curve of ix dra in superoutburst we removed the first or second order polynomial and analyzed them using anova statistics with two harmonic fourier series ( schwarzenberg - czerny 1996 ) .",
    "the resulting periodogram is shown in fig .",
    "the most prominent peak is found at a frequency of @xmath17 c / d , which corresponds to the period of @xmath18 days .",
    "the first harmonic of this frequency at @xmath19 c / d is also clearly visible .       combining this determination with the superhump period obtained from the @xmath15 analysis ,",
    "we conclude that the mean superhump period during the 2003 september superoutburst of ix dra was @xmath2 days ( @xmath3 min ) .    a very interesting feature of the power spectrum shown in fig .",
    "8 is a double structure of the main peak , which is visible both for the main frequency and its first harmonics .",
    "the secondary peak appears at @xmath20 c / d , which corresponds to @xmath21 days , and its first harmonic at @xmath22 c / d .",
    "the peak at @xmath23 is our _ rosetta stone _ for understanding the unusual phase reversal seen in ix dra and er uma . it is easy to find that the difference between the two main frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath23 is equal to the beat frequency @xmath25 c / d .",
    "this corresponds to a period of 8.1 days .",
    "this means that at the beginning of superoutbursts both waves oscillate in one phase , thus we detect clear superhumps with a large amplitude of 0.27 mag .",
    "after half of the beat cycle ( @xmath26 days ) the waves are shifted in phase by 0.5 .",
    "thus the maximum of the modulation characterized by @xmath27 occurs exactly in the place of birth of the secondary humps .",
    "the amplitude of the secondary humps is then increased by the second wave and they became stronger than the main maxima .    to check",
    "if our interpretation is correct , we decided to perform prewhitening of the light curve of ix dra from the superoutburst .",
    "the raw light curve from the period sep 20 - 26 , with the general decreasing trend removed , was fitted with two sine series corresponding to the two periods and their five harmonics :    @xmath28    knowing @xmath29 and @xmath30 we were able to remove the term containing @xmath31 and obtain pure modulations with @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting light curve , folded on the period @xmath32 days and averaged in 0.02 phase bins , is shown in fig .",
    "9 .    on the other hand , knowing @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath27",
    "we can remove the variability with @xmath27 and investigate the pure superhump profiles .",
    "this has been done in fig .",
    "10 , where we show individual light curves from 2003 september superoutburst prewhitened with @xmath27 .",
    "these light curves are phased with @xmath31 and averaged in 0.05 phase bins .",
    "it is now clear that there is no phase reversal , the first maximum is always the primary one , and superhumps behave as in normal su uma star .",
    "the same situation is in er uma .",
    "its superhump period , according to kato et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , is @xmath35 days ( @xmath36 c / d ) .",
    "the orbital period of the system determined from the radial velocity study of thorstensen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is @xmath37 days ( @xmath38 c / d ) .",
    "thus , the beat period between these two periods should be around 2.2 days .",
    "looking at the theta diagram of kato et al .",
    "( 2003a ) shown in their fig .",
    "3 , it is easy to find the peak at frequency of 15.7 c / d , which can be associated with the orbital period of the binary .",
    "the prewhitening of light curves of kato et al .",
    "( 2003a ) should certainly show that the peak at frequency of 15.7 c / d is real , corresponds to the orbital period and is responsible for phase reversal .",
    "our observations from aug 4 to aug 8 caught the star at the end of the superoutburst .",
    "the clear superhumps are visible in each night , including the night of aug 8 when the star faded almost to quiescence .    fig .",
    "11 shows the anova power spectrum for the four nights of the august superoutburst , with the overall brightness decrease removed .",
    "the highest peak is found at the frequency @xmath39 c / d which corresponds to the period of @xmath40 days .",
    "this value agrees well with the value of @xmath31 obtained for the september superoutburst .",
    "this is another argument for a constant superhump period during the entire superoutburst , because in september we covered the first and middle phases of the superoutburst and its late stages in august .",
    "typical dwarf nova starts its evolution as a binary stystem containing @xmath41 white dwarf and @xmath42 main sequence secondary . at the beginning ,",
    "the orbital period is of @xmath43 hours and decreases due to angular momentum loss ( @xmath44 ) through the magnetic braking via a magnetically constrained stellar wind from the donor star ( hameury et al .",
    "1988 , howell et al .",
    "1997 , kolb and baraffe 1999 , barker and kolb 2003 ) . at this stage",
    "the mass - transfer rates are typically at the level of @xmath45@xmath46 .",
    "the cv evolves towards shorter periods until the secondary becomes completely convective and magnetic braking greatly reduces .",
    "this happens for an orbital period of around 3 hours .",
    "the mass transfer significantly decreases and the secondary shrinks towards its equilibrium radius , below the roche lobe .",
    "abrupt termination of magnetic braking at @xmath47 hr produces a sharp 2 - 3 hr period gap in dwarf novae distribution .",
    "the binary reawakens as a cv at @xmath48 hr when mass transfer recommences .",
    "it is then driven mainly by angular momentum loss due to the gravitational radiation ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the orbital period still decreases while mass transfer stays at almost constant level .",
    "paczyski ( 1981 ) was the first to find that the minimal period for a cv containing a hydrogen rich secondary is around 80 min .",
    "modern evolution codes locate this boundary at around 65 min . at this point",
    ", the secondary star having mass of @xmath50 becomes a degenerate brown dwarf - like object and the system starts to evolve towards longer orbital periods approaching @xmath51 hr within the hubble time . during this period",
    "the mass transfer is reduced to @xmath52 and cv becomes a weak ( @xmath53 mag ) and inactive star .",
    "evolution above the period gap is very fast , implying that most cvs are presently at very short periods .",
    "kolb ( 1993 ) predicted that 99% of cvs should be below the gap and 70% of them should have `` bounced '' off the minimum - period limit and now be evolving back toward longer periods .",
    "this theoretical scenario seriously disagrees with observations , especially with respect to the minimal period .",
    "a sharp period cut - off is observed around 76 min .",
    "currently , the three dwarf novae with shortest orbital periods are gw lib with 76.8 min , di uma with 78.6 min and v844 her with 78.7 min ( fried et al . 1999 ,",
    "thorstensen et al .",
    "thus theoretical models , placing period `` bounce '' at @xmath54 min , disagree with observations at the level of @xmath43% .",
    "we do not deal here with two clear outliers with extremely short periods : v485 cen ( olech 1997 ) and 1rxs j232953.9 + 062814 ( uemura et al .",
    "2002 , thorstensen et al .",
    "2002b ) which are most probably cvs which were formed with fairly old and massive brown dwarf donors and thus can populate the period regime shortwards of the `` bounce '' period ( kolb and baraffe 1999 ) .",
    "there have been several hypothesis trying to explaining this discrepancy .",
    "patterson ( 1998 , 2001 ) suggested that increasing the angular momentum loss below the period gap to @xmath55 would solve the problem .",
    "king et al . ( 2002 ) showed that an intrinsic spread in minimum periods resulting from a genuine difference in some parameter controlling the evolution can solve the problem .",
    "the most probable second parameter might be different admixtures of magnetic stellar wind braking in a small part of systems .",
    "barker and kolb ( 2003 ) proposed that the additional source of angular momentum loss might be the mass loss from the system .",
    "however , the efficiency of this process would have to be very large to move `` bounce '' period from 65 to 70 min .",
    "barker and kolb ( 2003 ) also suggested that tidal deformation of the secondary may have an effect on the period minimum .",
    "however , realistic deformations increase the period minimum from 65 only to around 69 min .    it has also been suggested that the currently observed period minimum is not a true minimum due to an age effect ( king and chenker 2002 , barker and kolb 2003 ) . simply , the systems which are currently at 75 - 77 min have not had sufficient time to evolve to the true period `` bounce '' .    the latest results of andronov et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , based on data from open clusters , show that empirical angular momentum loss from the secondary is much longer than predicted by earlier models , and that the secondary star is in thermal equilibrium above and in the period gap .",
    "including angular momentum loss from the secondary in the form suggested by andronov et al .",
    "( 2003 ) improves the agreement between theory and observations in determining the period minimum .",
    "their data show that angular momentum loss for systems below period gap is at the level of 1.5 larger than resulting from gravitational radiation alone .",
    "this is still smaller that the value of 2 - 3 times suggested by patterson ( 1998 , 2001 ) .",
    "another serious discrepancy between theory and observations lies in the orbital period distribution . according to the theoretical models ( kolb 1993 , howell et al .",
    "1997 , barker and kolb 2003 ) , the galaxy is old enough to have 99% of its cvs below the period gap .",
    "as many as 70% of them should have reached their period minimum and to be currently evolving towards longer periods .",
    "these cvs are predicted to have very low mass transfer rates ( @xmath56 ) and low time averaged absolute brightness ( @xmath57 mag ) .",
    "this should create a clear period spike close to the minimum period , but observations show that the period distribution below period gap is flat ( patterson 1998 ) .    in fact , we currently know only four cvs which can be assumed to be potential period bouncers .",
    "they are wz sge , al com , eg cnc and di uma .",
    "the three former objects form a quite homogeneous group showing large eruptions typically once per decade and no ordinary outbursts .",
    "their mass transfer rates are low and they are very faint objects with @xmath58 mag . on the other hand , di uma belongs to the very active group of er uma stars .",
    "it goes into superoutburst every 30 - 45 days and into ordinary outburst every 8 days ( kato et al .",
    "1996 , fried et al . 1999 ) indicating very high mass transfer rate .",
    "all these four objects have orbital periods very close to the period cut - off .",
    "thus , from the observational point of view there is no clear evidence for the period `` bounce '' .",
    "one can simply assume that there is a larger dispersion in period excess for stars having short orbital periods .",
    "a discovery of a star with the period excess below 1% and an orbital period significantly longer than 80 min would be strong evidence for period `` bounce '' .",
    "the superhump period is simply the beat period between the orbital and precession rate periods :    @xmath59    the precession rate of the eccentric disc was first discussed by osaki ( 1985 ) .",
    "based on a nonresonant free - particle orbit at the disk edge he derived the following expression for the precession rate :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the binary separation , @xmath62 is the disc radius and @xmath63 is the mass ratio @xmath64 . at the 3:1 resonance we can assume that @xmath65 and hence :    @xmath66    defining the period excess @xmath5 as :    @xmath67    and using equation ( 5 ) we can simply derive the relation between the period excess and the mass ratio :    @xmath68    from the observational point of view it was first noticed by stolz & schoembs ( 1984 ) that @xmath5 grows with @xmath69 .",
    "this relation is obeyed not only by the ordinary su uma stars but also by the permanent superhumpers ( skillman & patterson 1993 ) .",
    "direct measurements of mass ratio @xmath63 in cvs yields the following relation :    @xmath70    which roughly agrees with the theory ( patterson 2001 ) .",
    "due to the mass loss from the secondary , the mass ratio @xmath63 decreases with time .",
    "thus it is very useful to trace the evolution of cataclysmic variable stars in the @xmath71 plane .      the longer period detected during the september superoutburst of ix dra is easily interpreted as the period of the superhumps .",
    "the most reasonable explanation for the shorter period is that it is the orbital period of the system .",
    "this then makes ix dra a unique object for two reasons :    1 .",
    "it is the first star , whose orbital period is visible throughout the superoutburst , 2 .",
    "it has an unusually small period excess of @xmath6% ( a lower value has been observed only in eg cnc - patterson et al .",
    "1998 ) .    since the period excess is known to scale with mass ratio ( see equations 7 and 8) the period difference observed in ix dra corresponds to a mass ratio of @xmath72 .",
    "assuming a typical white dwarf mass of between @xmath73 , the secondary component must have a mass lower than @xmath74 . even in the case of an extremely massive white dwarf close to the chandrasekhar limit ,",
    "the secondary component of ix dra could not have a mass greater than 0.045 solar masses , which makes it the best candidate among dwarf novae ( alongside eg cnc ) for a brown dwarf .",
    "the only class of stars in which one observes changes with a period equal to the orbital period during a superoutburst are wz sge stars , a subgroup of su uma stars which have very rare outbursts and very low mass transfer rates . in these stars",
    ", one does not observe superhumps during the first @xmath75 days of a superoutburst , only changes with orbital periodicity .",
    "afterwards , the orbital humps are replaced by the usual superhumps .",
    "it has recently been suggested that this is caused by the low mass ratio in wz sge stars , which results in a very large disc extending to the region where its particles can enter into a 2:1 orbital resonance .",
    "this generates a two - armed spiral pattern of tidal dissipation and is responsible for the light modulations with orbital period .",
    "superhumps are not seen from the beginning of the superoutburst as the disc is not yet sufficiently elliptical because of the low rate of mass transfer at this time ( osaki and meyer 2002 ) .",
    "the unusually low mass ratio of ix dra suggests that , during a superoutburst , the accretion disc extends to 80% of the distance between the components of the system ( see figs . 1 and 2 in osaki and meyer ) .",
    "this is analogous to the behavior of wz sge stars .",
    "however , unlike in their case , ix dra is characterized by a mass transfer rate at least an order of magnitude higher .",
    "thus , even at the start of the superoutburst the disc is large , massive and eccentric , allowing both the 2:1 and 3:1 resonances to occur .",
    "the disc precesses , and therefore both orbital humps and superhumps can be observed throughout the entire superoutburst .",
    "12 shows the position of ix dra in the period excess vs. orbital period diagram .",
    "points mark normal su uma stars , squares correspond to the permanent superhumpers while open circles indicate the wz sge dwarf novae with recurrence times of @xmath76 years ( wz sge , al com , eg cnc ) and the star di uma , which has frequent outbursts like ix dra .",
    "two other frequently outbursting dwarf novae : er uma and v1159 ori are shown with triangles .",
    "this figure is shown after patterson ( 1998 , 2001 ) with over 20 new objects being added from patterson et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and olech et al .",
    "( 2003b ) .",
    "the solid line shows the evolutionary path of a dwarf nova with a white dwarf of mass @xmath77 and a secondary component with effective radius 6% larger than that of a single main sequence star ( due to the distortion of the star filling its roche lobe - renvoiz et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "looking at this picture we can see that the theoretical models do not agree too well with observations .",
    "there are three ways of lowering the theoretical line to better fit the observational data :    1 .",
    "increasing the white dwarf mass up to @xmath78 solar masses , 2 .   increasing the effective radius of the distorted secondary by an unrealistic value of 20% ( renvoiz et al .",
    "2002 ) , 3 .",
    "assuming that stars with periods below 2 hours lose angular momentum about @xmath79 times more effectively than in the case of gravitational waves alone ( patterson 1998 , 2001 ) .",
    "hypothesis ( 3 ) is the most tempting , since it accelerates the evolution of the system , moving the line down and increasing the minimum period from 65 - 70 minutes up to 75 minutes , which agrees very well with observations ( the ordinary dwarf nova with the shortest known orbital period is gw lib with @xmath80 minutes - thorstensen et al . 2002a ) .",
    "our discovery places ix dra among the most evolved objects . according to the theory they should have very low absolute brightness ( @xmath81 mag ) and very low accretion rates",
    ". however , both ix dra and another atypical star , di uma , have the highest accretion rates observed in su uma stars , resulting in their high level of activity in the form of frequent outbursts and superoutbursts ( osaki 1995 , hellier 2001 , buat - mnard and hameury 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that very old dwarf novae , which most of the time are quiescent and behave like wz sge stars ( with outbursts every 20 years or more ) occasionally show greatly increased activity with a high accretion rate .",
    "di uma and ix dra are currently in this state .",
    "this high accretion rate may cause the mass loss from the system , supplementing the emission of gravitational waves as the cause of angular momentum loss .",
    "in total , we detected seven ordinary outbursts of ix dra .",
    "three of them with the best coverage are shown in fig . 13 . as in other su uma stars , near the maximum of normal outburst ix dra shows no other large amplitude oscillations except small flickering .",
    "however at around 0.5 mag below the maximum the star often starts to show clear modulations .",
    "the periodogram for nights from aug 22 to aug 25 is inconclusive , showing many peaks of similar power in the frequency range 12  16 c / d .    during the next outburst , which occurred on aug 30 ,",
    "ix dra was caught at maximum light and during this night we did not detect any periodic modulations . our 3.9-h run on aug 31 found the star at magnitude 0.8 mag fainter , showing clear modulations with amplitude of around 0.25 mag . the power spectrum for this run shows a broad peak at frequency of 15 c / d .",
    "the distance between two most prominent maxima is 0.132 d , indicating a period of about 0.066 days .",
    "the most conclusive results were obtained for the outburst lasting from sep 13 to sep 16 .",
    "the anova power spectrum for these nights shows a clear peak at frequency of @xmath82 c / d , corresponding to the period of @xmath83 days .",
    "this value is in very good agreement with the value of the orbital period derived from the september superoutburst . on the other hand ,",
    "it is only @xmath84 from the value of superhump period .",
    "an interesting feature visible in fig .",
    "13 are the clear dips in the light curve of ix dra observed at hjd of 874.44 , 877.5 and 896.53 .",
    "they appear aperiodically and their nature is unknown .",
    "finally , we conclude that during ordinary outbursts ix dra occasionally shows orbital humps .",
    "however , we can not exclude that , within errors , they are in fact superhumps or negative superhumps , such as were detected in v1159 ori during its outbursts ( patterson et al .",
    "fig . 14 shows the light curves of ix dra in quiescence obtained during the six longest runs . the anova power spectrum for interval sep 613 is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "15 . before calculation",
    ", the light curves were prewhitened using a first order polynomial .",
    "it is clear that the highest peak corresponds to a frequency of 13.05 c / d .",
    "however , we do not assume that this is the true period , but rather a 2-day alias of the peak found at @xmath85 .",
    "the latter frequency corresponds to a period of @xmath86 .",
    "this value agrees very well with our determination made for the september superoutburst and in normal outbursts .",
    "the question is why are the 1-day and 2-day aliases from fig .",
    "15 higher than the true peak for both intervals sep 613 and sep 213 .",
    "the explanation might lie in high amplitude flickering , which masks the weak orbital signal , and in mysterious wide dips which are clearly visible during nights of sep 3 and sep 13 .",
    "they add signal to the lower frequencies , increasing low frequency aliases to a level higher than the main peak .",
    "the main conclusion of this section is that , in quiescence , ix dra shows a weak signal with a period of @xmath87 days , i.e. with the same value as was observed in the september 2003 superoutburst , supporting the hypothesis that it is the orbital period of the binary system .",
    "in the mid 1990s , when the first three members of the er uma group were discovered , they seemed to be very unusual compared to normal su uma stars .",
    "the ordinary su uma star with the shortest supercycle of 134 days was yz cnc ( patterson 1979 , shafter and hessman 1988 ) .",
    "thus supercycles of er uma stars were about 3 - 4 times shorter",
    ". however , patterson et al . (",
    "1995 ) describing the results of the cba observational campaign for v1159 ori , claimed that there is no reason for introducing a new class of variable stars .",
    "simply , the observable traits of er uma - type stars seem to be consistent with garden - variety su uma stars .",
    "they follow the kukarkin - parengo relation connecting the amplitude of the outburst with recurrence time between normal outbursts ( kukarkin and parenago 1934 ) and the bailey relation connecting decay times from normal eruptions and orbital period of the binary ( bailey 1975 ) .",
    "they simply appear to be normal su uma stars with greater activity and greater luminosity due to their higher mass transfer rates ( osaki 1995 ) .    however , careful inspection of the diagram with recurrence intervals for supermaxima vs. normal maxima showed a significant gap between normal su uma stars and er uma - type variables ( see fig .",
    "18 of paterson et al .",
    "1995 ) .    since then",
    ", we have come to better understanding of the er uma stars . in particular , for four of them we know the orbital periods and we can put them into the @xmath88 plane .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "12 , where di uma and ix dra are plotted with open circles and er uma and v1159 ori with triangles .",
    "it is clear that er uma stars occupy completely different locations on this plane , having different mass ratios and different evolutionary status .",
    "the discovery of new variables of the su uma - type fills the above - mentioned gap in the diagram showing recurrence intervals for supermaxima vs. normal maxima .",
    "recent discoveries of mn dra with a supercycle of 60 days ( nogami et al .",
    "2003 ) , ss umi and ny ser with supercycles of 85 days ( kato et al .",
    "2000 , nogami et al . 1998 ) , v503 cyg and bf ara with supercycles of 89 days ( harvey et al . 1995 , kato et al .",
    "2002a , 2003b ) and v344 lyr with supercycle of 109.6 days ( kato et al .",
    "2002b ) results in a smooth transition from the normal su uma stars to er uma - type variables .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "16 , where normal stars are plotted with dots , wz sge variables with triangles , er uma stars with squares and newly discovered normal su uma stars with circles",
    ". a simple linear fit to the data gives the following relation :    @xmath89    which is shown as solid line .",
    "it is clear that this relation describes very well both er uma and normal su uma stars .",
    "finally , the gap between normal su uma stars and er uma - type variables has disappeared and , in the light of new discoveries , we can see a smooth transition from one group to another .",
    "our conclusion is similar to the statement of patterson et al ( 1995 ) that there is no need to artificially distinguish er uma stars from other su uma variables .",
    "we presented the results of the 2003 observational campaign of frequently outbursting dwarf nova ix draconis .",
    "the main conclusions of our work are :    1 .",
    "analysis of the global light curve spanning five months of observations shows that ix dra is a very active object and goes into superoutburst every 54 days and into a normal outburst every 3.1 days .",
    "according to the model by osaki ( 1995 ) , this is due to a very high mass rate of mass transfer from the secondary .",
    "2 .   during two best observed superoutburts",
    ", we detected the clear superhumps with a period of 0.066968(17 ) days ( @xmath3 min ) .",
    "the superhump period seems to be constant during entire superoutburst .",
    "3 .   during september",
    "2003 superoutburst , a second periodicity was clearly visible in the light curve of the star .",
    "its value was 0.06646(6 ) days ( @xmath4 min ) .",
    "a wave with the same period was detected during normal outbursts and in quiescence .",
    "we suggest that this is the orbital period of the binary system .",
    "the beat between superhump and orbital period is the main cause of an unusual phase reversal of maxima of superhumps - a phenomenon which was previously observed also in er uma itself ( kato et al . 2003a ) .",
    "we suggest that careful reanalysis of observations of er uma from superoutburst obtained by kato et al .",
    "( 2003a ) should result in discovery of the orbital period .",
    "the period difference observed in ix dra corresponds to a mass ratio @xmath72 . assuming a typical white dwarf mass of @xmath73",
    ", the secondary component must have a mass lower than @xmath74 , which makes it the best candidate among dwarf novae ( alongside eg cnc ) for a brown dwarf .",
    "ix draconis is the first su uma star showing orbital modulations during the entire superoutburst .",
    "this is possibly due to the extremely low mass ratio which allows the edge of the disc to reach 80% of the separation of the binary . in the outer region of the disc",
    ", its particles can enter into a 2:1 orbital resonance .",
    "this generates a two - armed spiral pattern of tidal dissipation and is responsible for the appearance of the light modulations with orbital period ( osaki and meyer 2002 ) .",
    "the position of ix dra in the period excess vs. orbital period plane suggests that the star is the most evolved cataclysmic variable star in the galaxy , which reached its period minimum long time ago and now evolves towards longer periods .",
    ".   high activity of ix dra is in clear contrast with the behavior of its neighbours in the @xmath71 plane which are mostly faint and inactive objects .",
    "thus we suggest that very old dwarf novae , which most of the time are quiescent and behave like wz sge stars , show occasionally greatly increased activity with a high rate of accretion .",
    "di uma and ix dra are currently in this state . this high rate of accretion may cause mass loss from the system , supplementing the emission of gravitational waves as the cause of angular momentum loss .      andronov n. , pinsonneault m. , sills a. , 2003 , apj , 582 , 358 bailey j.a . , 1975 ,",
