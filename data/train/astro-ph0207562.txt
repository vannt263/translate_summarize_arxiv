    "understanding galaxy formation and evolution requires observational information about hot , highly ionized gas in and near galaxies .",
    "numerical simulations of cosmological structure formation in the presence of cold dark matter indicate that a significant fraction of the baryonic material at low redshift should be shock - heated to temperatures of @xmath30k as the gas collapses and forms clusters and groups of galaxies ( e.g. , cen & ostriker 1999 ; dav et al . 1999 , 2001 ) .",
    "this reservoir of hot gas is detectable through ultraviolet absorption - line measurements ( tripp , savage , & jenkins 2000 ; savage et al .",
    "2002a ) , but a complete picture of how the hot gas in galaxies and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) are related does not yet exist because a variety of internal and external processes affect the heating and distribution of the interstellar gas in and around galaxies .",
    "in addition to the galaxy formation process , the accretion of satellite galaxies , tidal interactions , star formation , galactic winds , and galaxy - igm interactions may all contribute to the production of hot gas . to some extent ,",
    "all of these activities operate in and around our own galaxy , so studying the hot gas in the immediate environment of the milky way is a logical step in assessing the relevance and roles of these processes locally .",
    "one of the primary science objectives of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( @xmath0 ) mission is to determine the properties of hot , highly ionized gas in the low - redshift universe .",
    "a key component of this research has been the study of absorption along many sight lines through the galactic halo .",
    "such observations were not possible until @xmath0 was launched because previous observatories lacked either the spectral resolution or sensitivity to study the velocity structure of the absorption toward distant background sources . among the most interesting results to date",
    "is the detection of in high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) ( sembach et al .",
    "2000 ; murphy et al . 2000 ) . for decades",
    "astronomers have studied the neutral ( ) content of the clouds and have debated the origin and location of the high velocity gas . while it is generally accepted that no single model can account for all of the observed properties of the hvcs ( see wakker & van  woerden 1997 for a review ) , there is no unanimity on the fundamental properties of the different types of hvcs . with the re - introduction of the idea that some of the hvcs could be located outside of the milky way if they are embedded in halos of dark matter ( blitz et al . 1999 ) , the possible range of locations and cloud properties has widened .",
    "determining the ionization and hot gas content of the high velocity gas bears directly on the locations of the clouds and their interactions with other components of the gaseous interstellar and intergalactic media .",
    "the @xmath31 doublet lines in the far - ultraviolet spectral region are the best lines to use for kinematical investigations of hot ( @xmath32k ) gas in the low - redshift universe .",
    "oxygen is the most abundant element heavier than helium , and the lines have large oscillator strengths ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ; morton 1991 ) .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy of higher ionization lines ( e.g. , , ) is possible with _ xmm - newton _ and the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ for a small number of sources , but the spectral resolution ( r  @xmath35 ) is modest compared to that afforded by @xmath0 ( r  @xmath36 ) .",
    "lower ionization lines observable at high spectral resolution at ultraviolet wavelengths are generally either much weaker than the lines ( e.g. ,  @xmath37 ) or are better tracers of collisionally ionized gas at temperatures @xmath38k ( e.g. , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) .",
    "this latter set of ions is also considerably more susceptible to photoionization than since the photoionization cross sections of the ions are large and the ionization potentials are less than 54ev , the energy of the ionization edge .",
    "can be produced by photoionization under special conditions involving a hard radiation field and a very low gas density , but as we will show later , this does not appear to be a viable production mechanism for _ most _ of the observed in and near the milky way .",
    "this article is one in a series of three papers devoted to @xmath0 observations of absorption along complete paths through the galactic halo in the directions of quasars , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and bl lac objects .",
    "the other two papers include a catalog with basic measurements and illustrations of all of the profiles obtained in the survey ( wakker et al .",
    "2002 ) and a companion study of the absorption associated with the thick disk of the milky way ( savage et al .",
    "here , we concentrate on the properties of the absorption at high velocities with respect to those expected for gas participating in differential galactic rotation ( generally , `` high velocity '' refers to @xmath43 kms@xmath3  in this paper ) .",
    "high velocity absorption associated with the magellanic clouds is discussed elsewhere ( friedman et al . 2000 ; danforth et al . 2002 ; hoopes et al . 2001 , 2002 ; howk et al .",

    "full details of the @xmath0 observations and data reduction for the objects surveyed for high velocity are given by wakker et al .",
    "we summarize some of the key points here .",
    "the objects included in this study form an incomplete flux - limited sample of extragalactic objects drawn primarily from the @xmath0 science team , d / h , and agn programs conducted in the first two years of the mission ( december 1999  november 2001 ) .",
    "publicly available guest investigator ( gi ) observations have been included when it is clear that the science goals of our study and those of the gi do not conflict .",
    "most of the objects are either quasars or low - redshift type  1 seyfert galaxy nuclei , which have relatively smooth continua in the wavelength region of interest .",
    "a few additional background sources , such as bright regions of low - redshift starburst galaxies and two high latitude stars located @xmath44 kiloparsecs from the galactic disk , have been included as well .",
    "neither stellar sight line included in the sample ( vz1128 , pg0832 + 675 ) shows evidence of high velocity absorption . of the more than two hundred objects considered",
    ", only about half had data suitable for studies of the lines .",
    "total exposure times ranged from @xmath45 5 ksec to @xmath46 ksec per object , with a median of @xmath47 ksec per object .",
    "@xmath0 contains four co - aligned spectrographs that cover the 9051187spectral region .",
    "the optics ( a mirror and a holographically - ruled diffraction grating ) in two of the channels are coated with aluminum and lithium - fluoride ( lif ) for maximum throughput above 1000 .",
    "the other two channels contain optics with sic coatings for maximum throughput below 1000 .",

    ", the objects sometimes drifted around in the lwrs apertures .",
    "these drifts do not affect our study since each photon event recorded by the micro - channel plate detectors is time - tagged and can be corrected for these motions .",

    "( 2000 , 2002 ) and sahnow ( 2000a , 2000b ) .",
    "additional information can be found in the _ fuse observer s guide_.    all of the data were reduced in a homogeneous fashion with the standard @xmath0 pipeline software ( calfuse v1.8.7 ) available from the johns hopkins university .",
    "the lines are covered by all four @xmath0 channels , but we have opted to use data from only the two most sensitive channels ( lif1 , lif2 ) , which have optics coated with al+lif .",
    "these two channels account for roughly 76% of the @xmath0 effective area at the wavelengths of the lines . for the higher signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath49 ) observations",
    ", we used only the data from the lif1 channel and checked this result with the lif2 data .",
    "however , we combined the two independent measurements for lower @xmath49 observations to increase the detection confidence ( see wakker et al .",
    "2002 ) . to maximize @xmath49 , we used data obtained during both orbital day and night since the lines are in spectral regions unaffected by terrestrial airglow emission .",
    "the fully sampled @xmath0 data have a fwhm velocity resolution of @xmath50 kms@xmath3(@xmath51 ) .",
    "we set the zero point of the @xmath0 wavelength scale for each observation by referencing the observed @xmath52 and @xmath53 absorption features to the 21 cm emission observed in each direction [ see wakker et al .",

    "these sight lines exhibit varying degrees of complexity in their observed absorption and in the amount of blending with other atomic and molecular lines in the bandpass .",
    "all three sight lines contain high velocity absorption that is observable in the 1031.926  line . toward ngc7469 and pg1259 + 593 ,",
    "the high velocity @xmath58 absorption is blended with either @xmath59 @xmath60 or with nearby molecular hydrogen lines , whose wavelengths are indicated in the top panel .",

    "in our study of high velocity , we draw upon the measurements and detailed sight line comments presented in the @xmath0 catalog paper ( wakker et al . 2002 ) for the 102 objects with sufficient data quality to study the absorption .",
    "the catalog contains information about line strengths ( equivalent widths ) , velocities , and contamination by other absorption features .",
    "the catalog includes illustrations of the observed absorption profiles and some basic statistical information about the properties of the absorption and data quality .",
    "we present a complete list of the high velocity features in table  1 , sorted by galactic longitude .",
    "the table entries include the name of the background continuum source observed , the galactic coordinates ( @xmath61 ) of the background source , a data quality factor ( q ) , an `` identification '' ( i d ) for the high velocity absorption based on the correspondence with galactic structures or high velocity gas observed in 21 cm emission , the velocity range spanned by the ( @xmath62 ) , the average velocity and width of the absorption ( @xmath63 and b ) , the logarithmic column density , and the significance of the @xmath15 absorption - line detection ( @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the error in the equivalent width due to statistical noise fluctuations and continuum placement uncertainties ) .",
    "the data quality factor is an indicator of the continuum @xmath49 ( per 20 kms@xmath3  resolution element ) in the spectrum near the lines as follows : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "the derived properties of the high velocity gas depend in part upon the adopted separation of the high velocity absorption from lower velocity absorption arising in the nearby galactic disk and halo . in regions of the sky",
    "where there is little high velocity gas observed in other species ( e.g. , , , ) , the nearby absorption is generally found at @xmath70 kms@xmath3 , which we adopt as the typical velocity range of the galactic thick disk and halo absorption ( see savage et al .",
    "we define absorption outside this velocity range as high velocity gas , with a few minor exceptions to account for directions where there is reason to believe that the thick disk absorption extends to higher velocities . for example , differential galactic rotation may broaden the profiles in some directions , particularly low latitude sight lines in the @xmath71 and @xmath72 directions , as well as at longitudes in the general direction of the galactic center . in a few cases we contracted the thick disk limits and allowed the high velocity gas integration to extend to lower velocities by @xmath73 kms@xmath3  to account for absorption associated with known high velocity features ( e.g. , mrk  817 , which exhibits absorption in complex  c at velocities @xmath74 kms@xmath3 ) . for 5 lines of sight ,",
    "the separation is based on velocity structure .",
    "we list the integration limits ( @xmath75 ) for the high velocity gas in table  1 .",
    "we examined the @xmath0 spectra for absorption produced by the stronger member of the @xmath76 doublet because the higher velocity portions of the weaker line ( @xmath58 ) are usually severely blended with other interstellar lines .",
    "we searched for absorption at velocities @xmath77 kms@xmath3 , and with few exceptions all of the identified absorption is confined to the @xmath78 kms@xmath3  velocity range .",
    "the few possible cases where higher velocity features may be present are described in appendix  a of the catalog ( wakker et al .",
    "2002 ) and are not considered further here .",
    "the identification of high velocity @xmath15 requires careful consideration of the absorption produced by nearby lines of other atomic and molecular species ( see sembach 1999 for model templates of the absorption in the @xmath0 bandpass ) . at negative velocities ,",
    "the primary lines that blend with @xmath15 are the h@xmath54 ( 60 ) p(3 ) line at 1031.191  ( 214  kms@xmath3  with respect to the rest wavelength of the line ) and the lines at 1031.885 ( 303  kms@xmath3 ) and 1031.507  ( 122",
    "kms@xmath3 ) . at positive velocities ,",
    "the primary contaminant is the h@xmath54 ( 60 ) r(4 ) line at 1032.349  ( + 123 kms@xmath3 ) . of these ,",
    "the h@xmath54 lines are the most important , since even small h@xmath54 column densities in the @xmath79 or @xmath80 rotational levels produce detectable absorption lines ; 20m  features correspond to @xmath81 as low as @xmath82 @xmath21 ( see , e.g. , figure  1 , top panel ) .",
    "we carefully modeled the strengths of the h@xmath54 @xmath83 and @xmath84 lines in the wavelength region using other h@xmath54 lines in the same rotational levels at other wavelengths ( see wakker et al .",
    "2002 for a description of the procedure ) . a weak transition of at 1031.542  ( 112 kms@xmath3 ) produces negligible absorption along the low - density sight lines studied in this work .",
    "the deuterated hydrogen hd ( 60 ) r(0 ) @xmath85 line , which occurs at low velocities ( 4 kms@xmath3  with respect to @xmath15 ) , can be important for studies of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the galactic disk and halo but has not yet been observed in absorption at high velocities .",
    "hd is detected toward only one object in our sample ( ngc7469 , at low velocity ) and is not important for our study of the high velocity gas along this sight line , though it must be accounted for in our study of the halo gas in this direction ( savage et al .",
    "2002b ) .",
    "another possible source of confusion with the high velocity @xmath15 absorption is redshifted and metal - line absorption in the intergalactic medium along the sight line or in the immediate environment of the qso / agn .",
    "the most important lines to search for within @xmath86 kms@xmath3  of the @xmath15 line are ly@xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) and ly@xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) , but we also found instances of ly@xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) , ly@xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath40 ( @xmath95 ) , @xmath53 ( @xmath96 ) , and @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) . whenever possible , we have checked existing _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ data for corresponding ly@xmath99 absorption or @xmath0 data for other lyman series lines to confirm or refute such identifications .",

    ", the abundance of in collisionally ionized gas is expected to be less than a few percent of the total oxygen abundance , even in non - equilibrium cooling situations ( shapiro & moore 1976 ) .",
    "we report two errors for each of the column densities in table  1 .",
    "the first error ( @xmath112 ) is a quadrature addition of the uncertainties associated with continuum placement and statistical ( poisson ) noise propagated through the line profile following the procedures outlined by sembach & savage ( 1992 ) .",
    "this error accounts for most of the uncertainty involved in making an objective estimate of the line strength .",
    "the second error ( @xmath113 ) is a quadrature addition of systematic uncertainties accounting for fixed - pattern noise , choice of velocity integration limits , and removal of h@xmath54 features .",
    "this error , which often dominates the total error , accounts for some of the more subjective decisions that must be made when measuring the line strength . to be conservative , we have made generous allowances for the various components of @xmath113 .",
    "the fixed - pattern noise component of the systematic error accounts for an intensity uncertainty of @xmath56% integrated over the width of one resolution element .",
    "fixed - pattern noise structures can mimic weak , high velocity absorption lines .",
    "this pattern can vary from one observation to the next , depending upon the positions of the spectra on the microchannel plates . whenever possible , we checked the data from multiple instrument channels ( lif1 , lif2 ) to determine the impact of fixed - pattern noise on the observed absorption features .",
    "the velocity integration component of the systematic error accounts for changes of @xmath114 kms@xmath3  in the values of @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",

    "( 2002 ) to a value appropriate for an integration range of 100 kms@xmath3 .",

    "if the gas is photoionized , the temperature may be as low as @xmath129k .",
    "consider the following conservative example . a single isolated gaussian @xmath15 feature that arises in @xmath130k gas and has _ no _ additional broadening beyond its thermal width ( b  @xmath131 kms@xmath3 ) must have an intrinsic central optical depth @xmath132 before a 0.10 dex saturation correction is required for a @xmath0 observation of the @xmath15 line . when observed at the resolution of @xmath0",

    "since all but a few of the observed features have line widths well in excess of the instrumental width , cold narrow components can contribute only a fraction of the total observed columns , and therefore the effects of these components on the resulting @xmath106 profiles is diminished by broader components ( i.e. , their central optical depths would have to be much greater than unity to impact the total column density by 0.1 dex . )    ideally , one would like to check explicitly whether unresolved saturated structure is present in the observed absorption profiles by comparing the values of @xmath106 for both lines of the doublet . in practice",
    ", this is difficult to do for high velocity since the high velocity portions of the 1037.617  line are often blended with other galactic absorption features .",
    "the comparison at high velocities is possible in two cases ( eso572-g34 and pg1116 + 215 ) , and no unresolved saturated structure is found . for sight lines where it is possible to examine the low velocity portions of the profiles , the @xmath15 and @xmath58 results are usually in good agreement , implying that saturation corrections for absorption in the thick disk / halo of the galaxy are not required for most of the observations .",

    "the values of @xmath138 range from @xmath140 to 1.6 , with 4 of the 5 cases having saturation corrections of less than 0.25 dex ( see savage et al .",
    "2002b ) . since the high velocity absorption features are generally weaker than the thick disk / halo features , saturation corrections for the high velocity gas are small enough that they do not affect the scientific conclusions of this study .",
    "we show examples of the apparent column density profiles for the mrk  509 , eso572-g34 , and pg1116 + 215 sight lines in figure  2 . toward mrk509 , the thick disk / halo @xmath15 absorption at low velocities",

    "the @xmath58 absorption is blended with other features at high velocities , so a direct comparison of the @xmath106 profiles at @xmath141 kms@xmath3  is not possible .",
    "however , the good agreement in the @xmath106 profiles between 50 and + 100 kms@xmath3   suggests that the weaker , high velocity absorption seen in the @xmath15 line should not be affected by unresolved saturated structure . toward both eso572-g34 and pg1116 + 215 ,",
    "the high velocity and thick disk / halo absorption features have comparable strengths and widths .",
    "the good agreement in the @xmath106 profiles at velocities between 50 and + 250 kms@xmath3shows that the data are unaffected by unresolved saturated structure .",
    "thus , the @xmath106 profiles for these sight lines are also valid instrumentally - smeared representations of the true values of @xmath142 .",
    "since the high velocity line widths and column densities are correlated ( see  9.3 ) , we conclude that saturation effects do not strongly influence the column densities derived for the high velocity gas .      for each sight line where high velocity is observed ,",
    "we calculated the centroid velocity of the absorption by integrating the first moment of the apparent optical depth profiles , @xmath143 , over the velocity range ( @xmath115 to @xmath116 ) used for the column density calculation .",
    "we calculated the velocity widths by integrating the second moments of the apparent optical depth profiles , b  =  @xmath144 , over the same velocity range .",

    "most of the high velocity features observed are weak [ @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , the derived value of the line width can be sensitive to the integration limits and to noise fluctuations near the ends of the integration range .",
    "it is best to examine the values of b for the sample in a statistical sense rather than regarding these as robust measures of the high velocity widths for individual sight lines .",

    "whenever possible , we have identified the high velocity absorption features listed in table  1 with corresponding high velocity features observed in 21 cm emission .",
    "data of varying quality exist for all of the sight lines considered here .",
    "the available single - dish radio data are shown by wakker et al .",
    "the sources of data include the leiden - dwingeloo survey ( hartmann & burton 1997 ) , nrao 140-foot telescope observations ( murphy et al . 1996 ) , the villa elisa survey ( arnal et al .",

    "( 2002b ) . the thick disk / halo distribution of column densities , which is indicated in figure  4 with a dashed line , is reasonably well represented as a gaussian distribution . however , the observed velocity distribution for the high velocity is skewed and considerably broader because it is possible to trace lower column density features at velocities where blending with other absorption is minimal .",
    "low column density features exist in the thick disk / halo distribution as well ( see jenkins 1978a ) , but they are presumably blended with stronger features at similar velocities .",
    "the lowest column density observed for the milky way thick disk / halo ( @xmath164 toward mrk1095 , not counting upper limits ; savage et al .",

    "( 2002b ) reveals no correlation between @xmath25()@xmath166 and @xmath184(x ) , which if taken at face value seems to indicate that the x - ray and high velocity are coupled more strongly .",
    "this too may be the result of selection effects .",
    "the interpretation of this plot is complicated by various problems encountered when comparing infinitesimal point source absorption - line observations with low resolution ( both spatial and spectral ) x - ray emission observations .",

    "large column densities for the high velocity gas occur in the southern galactic hemisphere in directions associated with either the magellanic stream ( e.g. , fairall  9 , ngc  1705 ) or possible extragalactic clouds ( e.g. , mrk  304 , mrk  926 ) .",
    "in a few cases ( e.g. , eso265-g23 , eso572-g34 ) , large column densities also occur in the northern galactic sky .",

    "to make a meaningful estimate of the sky covering factor of the high velocity gas , it is important to note that the data quality varies from sight line to sight line .",
    "if we consider only the highest quality ( @xmath186 ) sight lines in the sample , we find that 22 of 26 sight lines have _ total _ high velocity equivalent widths @xmath187m  at a detection confidence [ @xmath188_{tot } \\ge 3.0 $ ] . the remaining four @xmath186 sight lines ( ngc1068 , pg0804 + 761,viizw118 , and vz1128 ) have equivalent width errors that would allow high confidence detections of 30m   features if they were present ( see table  2 ) . the @xmath186 sight lines are scattered across the sky and are not unique to one particular region . at lower data qualities ( @xmath189 ) , the percentage of sight lines with @xmath187mdetected at high confidence drops to about 50% , with few of the non - detection sight lines having sufficient data quality to rule out weak absorptions .",
    "fifty - nine of the 102 sight lines in the sample have total high velocity equivalent widths @xmath190m  at a detection confidence [ @xmath188_{tot } \\ge 3.0 $ ] .",
    "thus , a key result of our survey is that a large fraction ( at least 58% and perhaps as many as 85% ) of the sight lines contain high velocity with @xmath191m .    at higher equivalent width thresholds , @xmath192m , the effect of data quality on the resulting detection rate",

    "2002a ) or the galactic thick disk / halo .",
    "positive detections of associated with the thick disk / halo occur for 91 of the 102 sight lines in our sample , and the eleven non - detections occur for sight lines where the data quality is marginal ( savage et al .",

    "the kinematics , elemental abundances , molecular content , and locations of the intermediate velocity clouds ( ivcs ) indicate that they are part of the galactic processes that circulate and distribute interstellar material in the thick disk and halo of the galaxy ( houck & bregman 1990 ; richter et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "the ivc population appears in most cases to be distinct from higher velocity phenomena traced in ( see wakker 2001 ) , and it is likely that the ivc population is not strongly connected with the high velocity phenomena we observe in absorption .",
    "there is no general correlation in the amount of intermediate and high velocity or observed along the sight lines in our sample .",
    "table  7 contains a general breakdown of the number of sight lines containing negative and positive high velocity features . for several cuts in galactic longitude and latitude we list the number of sight lines containing at least one high velocity component with a velocity centroid , @xmath63 , exceeding a threshold velocity , @xmath284 .",
    "the table quantifies the graphical results shown in figures  8 and 10 , namely that the @xmath247 region of the sky contains predominantly negative velocities , while the @xmath285 region of the sky contains predominantly positive velocities .",
    "combined , roughly 58% ( 59/102 ) of the sight lines have features with @xmath286 kms@xmath3 , and 28% ( 29/102 ) have features with @xmath287 .",

    "data quality affects these percentages since weak features ( @xmath290m ) are below the detection limit for some sight lines .",
    "thus , the percentages enclosed within parentheses in table  7 are best treated as lower limits . for comparison",
    ", we also tabulate the all - sky percentages for the highest quality ( @xmath186 ) sight lines within square brackets in table  7 . as expected , the @xmath186 sight line percentages are higher than those for the entire sample .",
    "the observed line widths of the high velocity features range from b  @xmath47 to @xmath291 kms@xmath3 .",
    "we show the distributions of b - values for the high velocity gas and thick disk / halo absorption in figure  12 .",
    "these b - values have not been corrected for a small amount of instrumental broadening ( b@xmath292 kms@xmath3 ) .",
    "the average high velocity feature width is @xmath9b@xmath293",
    "kms@xmath3  if all of the high velocity features listed in table  1 are considered . in some cases , the line widths are less reliable since they depend strongly on the exact choice of the velocity cutoff between thick disk / halo absorption and the high velocity absorption used in the calculation of b. thus , one must be careful about interpreting the meaning of the line width for some sight lines , especially when the thick disk / halo and high velocity portions of the absorption merge without recovery to the continuum at intermediate velocities .",
    "these less reliable values of b are enclosed in parentheses in table  1 .",
    "for the 19 features having reliable b - values , @xmath9b@xmath294 kms@xmath3 , which is indistinguishable from the value for the entire sample .    the average high velocity line width is smaller than the value of @xmath9b@xmath295 kms@xmath3  found for the low velocity ( savage et al .",
    "this is due in part to the reduced blending of the high velocity gas as well as the multi - component nature of the low velocity gas , which by definition occurs between @xmath296 kms@xmath3 . if the broadening is purely thermal in nature , the smallest doppler widths in the high velocity sample ( b @xmath47 kms@xmath3 ) correspond to temperatures of @xmath297k , the temperature at which peaks in abundance under conditions of collisional ionization equilibrium ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .",
    "these small widths are only slightly larger than the instrumental resolution , so it is possible that the temperatures may be lower in these few cases .",
    "the larger line widths are likely dominated by turbulent broadening , shear , or flows rather than thermal broadening at high temperatures since the fractional abundance of decreases rapidly at @xmath298k ( i.e. , b@xmath299 kms@xmath3 ) ( shapiro & moore 1976 ; sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .",
    "we detect high velocity along every sight line in our sample for which there is a known high velocity cloud observed in 21 cm emission along the sight line .",
    "these hvcs include large complexes of gas , such as complex  c and the magellanic stream , as well as smaller isolated clouds .",

    "the metallicity of complex  c is @xmath217 ( wakker et al .",
    "1999 ; richter et al . 2001 ) , but may be as high as @xmath306 in some locations ( gibson et al .",
    "the gas in complex  c has lsr velocities ranging from approximately 100 to 170 kms@xmath3 , which is sufficient to separate the absorption from both the milky way thick disk / halo absorption in this direction ( extending out to @xmath307 kms@xmath3 ) and intermediate velocity absorption features along the path to complex  c , such as the intermediate velocity arch ( @xmath308 kms@xmath3 ) ( see wakker 2001 ) .",
    "complex  c contains ionized gas as revealed through previous observations of absorption ( murphy et al .",

    "all of the sight lines lie in the direction of some emission , and additional intermediate and high velocity features ( iv  arch , complex  a , complex  k ) are identified .",

    "we plot the @xmath15 and @xmath311 absorption profiles for each of the 9 complex  c sight lines in figure  14 .",

    "the 21 cm emission provides information about the velocity structure of the primary neutral gas concentrations along the sight lines , while the profile reveals the total velocity extent of the neutral plus weakly ionized gas .",
    "absorption is present at the velocities of the 21 cm emission in complex  c. thus , the highly ionized and neutral gases appear to be kinematically related in these different directions .",
    "values of @xmath173 ( ) range from 13.67 to 14.35 , with an average of 13.93 and a standard deviation of 0.25 dex .",
    "the centroids range from a low of @xmath314 kms@xmath3  ( pg1259 + 593 ) to a high of @xmath315 kms@xmath3  ( mrk279 , mrk  876 , pg1626 + 554 ) .",
    "we summarize the relative velocities and column densities of the and in table  8 .",
    "the and velocities track each other reasonably well , with a typical scatter of @xmath316 kms@xmath3 .",
    "there is no obvious dependence of the column density on the column density .",
    "for example , two sight lines ( mrk279 and pg1351 + 540 ) with @xmath173 ( ) @xmath317 have columns that differ by 0.46 dex , and two sight lines ( mrk506 and mrk876 ) with @xmath173 ( ) @xmath318 have columns that differ by 0.66 dex .",
    "however , there is a weak trend for the ratio of the two species to change with position across complex  c , with higher values of @xmath25()/@xmath25 ( ) at higher longitudes .",

    "the similarities in the general locations of the northern sight lines exhibiting absorption wings and in their velocities suggest that many of the wing features could have a common origin .",
    "one possibility is that the wings trace hot gas expelled from the galactic disk .",
    "sembach et al .",
    "( 2001b ) examined the absorption toward 3c273 and found that the high positive velocity in that direction has no detectable counterpart in other species , including .",
    "they interpreted the high velocity absorption as an indicator of hot gas flowing out of the galactic disk .",
    "the 3c273 sight line passes through radio loops i and iv ( berkhuijsen , haslam , & salter 1971 ) and through a region of enhanced soft x - ray emission associated with the north polar spur ( snowden et al .",
    "the radio loops are filled with x - ray emission and were probably created by supernovae in the galactic disk ( iwan 1980 ; snowden et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the absence of lower ionization absorption and the presence of 0.25 kev emission suggests that the -bearing gas is hot ( @xmath376k ) .",
    "not all of the northern sight lines with high positive velocity wings lie in the direction of loop i or the north polar spur , so it is not possible to associate all of these wings with these two large galactic structures",
    ". however , similar physical processes may be at work along many of these sight lines , and the wider - spread existence of the wings beyond the confines of loop i may signal a larger scale production and acceleration of hot gas in the northern galactic sky than in the south .    an additional argument in favor of the idea that some of the positive velocity wings trace gas expelled from the galactic disk is that hot gas expelled from the galactic disk , perhaps as part of a `` galactic fountain '' ( shapiro & field 1976 ; bregman 1980 ; norman & ikeuchi 1989 ) , would likely contain .",

    "the enhancement of the thick disk in the north may indicate a generally elevated level of hot gas production these latitudes .",
    "for a few sight lines , like eso572-g34 , mrk734 , pg1001 + 291 , or irasf1143 - 1810 , the distinction between displaced thick disk / halo absorption and high velocity absorption is particularly nebulous .",
    "alternatively , some of the broad absorption wings may be entirely unrelated to the thick disk of the milky way .",
    "some of the gas could be tidal debris remaining from encounters of the milky way and the magellanic clouds or other small galaxies .",
    "most of the wing sight lines lie near the orbit of the magellanic system .",
    "another possibility might be that the wings are the positive velocity counterparts of the negative velocity lg features in the southern galactic sky .",
    "the primary drawback to both of these hypotheses is that absorption wings are not discrete features like those associated with the magellanic stream ( ms , mse ) or local group ( lg ) features in the south , and at least qualitatively , they appear to be a continuation of the thick disk / halo velocity distribution . additional observations of other species at these velocities , especially if abundances could be derived , would be particularly valuable in discriminating between the possible origins of the wings .    finally , we call attention to the mrk509 sight line , which is one of the southern directions in the sample with a positive velocity wing . unlike the 3c273 sight line",
    ", this wing is detected in other species , including , , , and ( see sembach et al .",

    "a subset of features listed in table  1 have a category of lg ( local group ) assigned to them .",

    "all of the lg clouds are located in the southern galactic hemisphere , mostly in the @xmath380 longitude range .",
    "this is also the same general area of sky containing many of the mse sight lines .",

    "this velocity cutoff provides isolation of the high velocity absorption from the absorption produced by the thick disk / halo of the galaxy . the thick disk / halo absorption is roughly characterized by a patchy plane - parallel slab of hot gas with an exponential scale height of 2.3 kiloparsecs in the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane ( see savage et al .",

    "the remainder are divided roughly equally between the lg , epn , and mse categories .",
    "there is still a deviation well above and beyond that expected , regardless of whether or not the halo corotates ( i.e. , the velocities do not obey any simple relation with the thick disk velocities . ) .",
    "the smaller dispersion in the deviation velocities in the non - corotating model suggests that much of the high velocity does not know about the rotation of the galaxy , but it does not imply that the galaxy has a static halo of smoothly distributed .",
    "the model assumes a smooth gas distribution , but the in the thick disk / halo is known to be quite patchy in nature , even on small angular scales ( howk et al .",
    "if there were a smooth gas distribution and the halo were not rotating , we would expect to see absorption profiles that had secondary absorption minima due to velocity crowding at the terminal velocities for some sight lines .",

    "there is considerable interest in understanding whether galaxies have large - scale winds that are capable of altering the structure of the ism and expelling heavy elements into the igm . in all cases ,",
    "the outflowing winds are expected to be hot , since it is typically supernovae and star - formation processes that power them . as a result",
    ", the best evidence for galactic winds often comes from x - ray observations and from ultraviolet measurements of highly ionized species such as , , and ( see , e.g. , heckman 2002 and martin 2002 for current discussions of this topic and additional references ) .",
    "an outflow in the starburst galaxy ngc1705 has been observed by @xmath0 ( heckman et al .",
    "2001 ) , and lower velocity hot gas flows may also be present in the lmc ( howk et al .",
    "2002b ) .    in the milky way",
    ", there is evidence that a wind emanating from the galactic center has resulted in the expulsion ( or ionization ) of much of the neutral ism above z  @xmath444 kpc in the inner 3 kpc of the galaxy ( lockman 1984 ) .",
    "the possibility of a strong galactic wind has been considered by hirashita , kamaya , & mineshige ( 1997 ) , while a review of more quiescent wind activity and galactic `` fountains '' is given by breitschwerdt & komossa ( 2000 ) .",
    "the detailed nature of a galactic wind depends upon many factors , including the energy input at the base of the wind , the structure and density of the ism , the gravitational potential of the galaxy at the site of the wind flow , magnetic fields and cosmic ray support of material , and the efficiency of the entrainment of cooler material in the flow .",
    "few of these variables are known in detail , but models of winds in rotating galaxies like our own indicate that a galactic wind could be driven by cosmic rays and heated in part by alfven waves , with the gas corotating with the underlying galactic disk up to altitudes of several kiloparsecs ( zirakashvili et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "consider the case of a spherically - symmetric unbound wind that flows completely out of the galaxy .",
    "the simplest directions to look for signs of an outflow would be directly toward or directly away from the galactic center , since the effects of galactic rotation would be minimized . toward @xmath488 , we see high positive velocity , as expected . toward @xmath489",
    "we see both positive and negative velocity features . however , the number of sight lines in both directions is very limited . at high latitudes ( @xmath490 ) ,",
    "positive wind velocities should dominate , which is qualitatively consistent with the velocities in figure  8 . at lower latitudes ,",
    "the expected wind velocity depends on galactic longitude and the distance of the wind particles from the sun . in the range @xmath491 ,",
    "positive velocities are expected since the gas lies outside the solar circle . between @xmath492 and @xmath493 ,",
    "positive velocities are expected for the wind beyond the galactic center , while predominantly negative velocities are expected for gas within the solar circle on the near side of the galactic center .",
    "the altitude at which a sight line intercepts the wind influences the observed wind velocity ; the projected velocity for higher - z sight lines would be lower than for sight lines passing nearer the disk of the galaxy . furthermore , if the source of the wind was not a localized phenomenon but was instead spread over the disk of the galaxy ( say , in spiral arm locations ) , then the gas motions may be dominated by regional activity . indeed , evidence of localized outflow from the scutum supershell exists for several ionization stages , including ( sterling et al . 2002 ) . some of features we observe in our survey ( e.g. , the positive velocity absorption wings ) are consistent with the presence of localized outflow from the galactic disk .",
    "we conclude that the complexity of the high velocity sky , selection effects , and the unknown extent of a galactic wind make it difficult to find conclusive evidence for a large - scale galactic outflow , nor can we rule out its presence without additional information .",
    "future observations targeted at addressing this issue in specific directions in both the milky way and the magellanic clouds are needed .",
    "several authors have argued convincingly against a distributed local group location for many of the hvcs using statistical studies of the neutral gas in other galaxy groups ( e.g. , charlton , churchill , & rigby 2000 ; zwaan & briggs 2000 ) .",
    "one way to escape this argument is to require that the clouds be located close to the large galaxies within the groups ( @xmath494 kpc ) . for clouds in the local group ,",
    "this makes it difficult to distinguish between a cloud population related to the milky way and a truly local group population based on kinematical information alone ( i.e. , the dispersions in the cloud velocities in the gsr and lgsr reference frames are similar , and strong observational selection effects apply - see  8.2 ) . as a result",
    ", additional information is needed to determine if the clouds are located in the local group .",
    "for the subsample of high velocity lg , epn , and mse features considered in table  10 , the dispersions of the velocity distributions in the gsr and lgsr reference frames are smaller than the dispersion in the lsr reference frame .",
    "furthermore , in the gsr and lgsr reference frames , the dispersions for this subsample are smaller than the dispersions listed in table  6 for the entire high velocity sample ( table  6 ) .",
    "the shaded regions of figure  7 highlight the velocity distributions of these 50 features .",
    "several of the sight lines classified as lg have ionization or abundance information that support an extragalactic location (  6.5 ) .",
    "the mse sight lines are included in this subsample , even though their velocities are similar to those of the magellanic stream , since their positions on the sky do not correspond to the locations of the bulk of the 21 cm emission from the stream .",
    "objects classified as lg , epn , or mse in table  1 would be excellent candidates for concerted efforts to determine the ionized gas content , gas - phase conditions , elemental abundances , and distances of the high velocity gas .",
    "increasing the number of absorption - line measurements along other sight lines in the regions of the sky where the lg , epn , and mse features are found is highly desirable .",
    "unfortunately , with current instrumentation , the number of additional background sources bright enough to observe in reasonable integration times is limited .",
    "an alternate approach , that of imaging the in emission at very faint levels over large fields of view , may soon be possible with the nasa s small explorer mission for _ spectroscopy and photometry of the intergalactic medium s diffuse radiation ( spidr)_. such measurements would help to set the context for the absorption - line measurements in this study and perhaps reveal the association ( if any ) of these features with other high velocity gas .",
    "high velocity is both widespread and common along complete paths through the galactic halo .",
    "the high velocity traces numerous phenomena , including tidal interactions with the magellanic clouds ( via the magellanic stream ) , accretion of low metallicity gas ( e.g. , complex  c ) , highly ionized clouds ( e.g. , the mrk  509 hvcs ) , and the outflow of hot gas from the galactic disk ( e.g. , the broad positive velocity absorption features ) . distinguishing between all of the possible phenomena occurring at large distances from the galactic plane is not easy , and clearly any attempt to treat all detections of the high velocity as a single population of clouds would be a serious mistake .",
    "that being said , considerations of subsets of the high velocity features suggest some intriguing possibilities .",
    "much of the high velocity probably occurs at large distances from the galactic plane .",
    "there have not yet been any detections of high velocity at high latitudes toward halo stars out to distances of several kiloparsecs .",
    "the two stars in our sample are the most distant halo stars examined for high velocity absorption ( @xmath495 kpc ) . in a study of approximately two dozen halo star sight lines , zsargo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find low velocity absorption associated with the galactic thick disk / halo but no high velocity absorption at @xmath496 kms@xmath3 . despite the difficulties encountered in estimating the stellar continua ,",
    "this result is fairly robust , especially the absence of discrete high velocity features with modest optical depths .",
    "broad absorption wings , like those discussed in  8.1 , would be much more difficult to detect against stellar continua with substantial curvature than against the relatively smooth spectra of qsos and agns .",
    "the number of halo sight lines toward hot stars examined for high velocity absorption is small , so the absence of high velocity in halo regions within a few kiloparsecs of the galactic disk is by no means ruled out .",
    "some high velocity is observed toward the magellanic clouds at velocities intermediate to those expected for the galactic thick disk / halo and the magellanic clouds ( hoopes et al .",
    "2002 ; howk et al .",
    "the distance of the high velocity in this direction is unknown , but is likely to be more than a few kiloparsecs from the galactic plane .",
    "one possible explanation for much of the high velocity is that it arises at the boundaries between cool / warm clouds of gas and a very hot ( @xmath27k ) galactic corona or local group medium .",
    "a hot , highly extended corona much larger than the thick disk / halo region might be left over from the formation of the milky way or local group , or may be the by - product of continuous accretion of smaller galaxies over time .",
    "interactions of this type have been proposed to explain the observed h@xmath99 emission from the magellanic stream ( weiner & williams 1996 ) , the shape and confinement of some stream concentrations ( stanimirovic et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the shapes of supergiant shells along the outer edge of the lmc ( de  boer et al .",
    "n - body simulations of the tidal evolution and structure of the magellanic stream favor a low - density medium for imparting weak drag forces to deflect some of the stream gas and providing a possible explanation for the absence of stars in the stream ( gardiner & noguchi 1996 ; gardiner 1999 ) .",
    "moore & davis ( 1994 ) also postulated a hot , low - density corona to provide ram pressure stripping of some of the magellanic cloud gas and to explain the absence of gas in globular clusters and nearby dwarf spheroidal companions to the milky way ( see also blitz & robishaw 2000 ) .",
    "constraints on the density of the galactic corona from considerations of the survivability of the magellanic stream range from @xmath497 @xmath29 based on dynamical arguments [ e.g. , drag ( moore & davis 1994 ) ] to @xmath498 @xmath29 based on thermal considerations [ e.g. , heating and evaporation ( murali 2001 ) ] . in either case , there would be little x - ray emission from the extended corona or local group medium at these densities , and no observational constraints on the extragalactic x - ray background observed by rosat are violated by the presence of such a medium ( see rasmussen & pedersen 2001 ) .    in such a scenario , one would expect the to occur at the boundaries between neutral or weakly ionized gas clouds and the hotter ( @xmath499 k ) medium .",
    "the data for sight lines that pass through complex  c are consistent with the idea that the complex  c is falling into and interacting with a highly extended corona .",
    "the similarity in the general velocity structure of the and indicates that the spatial relationship is probably also close ( see figure  14 and table  8) .",
    "the boundary between the and the hot corona is probably thin enough that the negative velocity extension of the is essentially determined by the kinematics at the boundary ( i.e. , by the motion of the ) rather than by larger scale thermal motions in hot gas or boundary layer .",
    "the distance of complex  c ( @xmath304 kpc , z",
    "@xmath500 kpc ) is sufficiently large that any interactions must be occurring well above the galactic plane , either with the galactic corona or with the outer regions of the thick disk / halo .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of clouds moving through a hot , low - density medium show that weak bow shocks develop on the leading edges of the clouds as the gas is compressed and heated ( quilis & moore 2001 ) .",
    "although the simulations were motivated in an attempt to explain the `` head - tail '' structures seen for some hvcs as they pass through the lower halo ( brns , et al . 2000 ; brns , kerp , & pagels 2001 ) , they also provide some guidance for lower density situations .",
    "the exact nature of the interaction depends on the relative speeds and densities of the two gases .",
    "the high velocity features generally have velocities comparable to the adiabatic sound speed in a medium of the type described above , and both projection effects and motion of the medium itself ( e.g. , a galactic wind ) would serve to increase the mach number of the clouds .",
    "however , even if the clouds are not moving at supersonic speeds relative to the ambient medium , some viscous or turbulent stripping of the cooler gas occurs ( see quilis & moore 2001 ) .",
    "this type of turbulent mixing of hot and warm gases has been described in detail by slavin , shull , & begelman ( 1993 ) .",
    "thermal conduction may also be efficient , depending upon the orientation of the magnetic field relative to the conduction front ( borkowski , balbus , & fristrom 1990 ) .",
    "fast ionization of cold gas may also occur through the `` critical velocity effect '' if the coronal plasma itself is magnetized ( see konz et al . 2001 ) .",
    "thus , the exact details of the mixing and heating of the gas depend on the geometry of the clouds , the entrainment velocity of the gas , the presence of magnetic fields , and several other physical quantities .",
    "the presence or absence of neutral gas associated with the high velocity in the interacting corona scenario would depend on several factors , most notably the mass of the cool / warm gas cloud passing through the corona and the heating efficiency .",
    "the good correspondence of the absorption velocities and the 21 cm emission velocities in the directions of substantial concentrations ( e.g. , complex  c , the magellanic stream - see figures  14 and 15 and table  8) argue that the interface region between the corona and the cooler material must be relatively compact compared to the overall size of the cloud .",
    "the larger line widths seen for are consistent with additional sources of turbulence expected for mixing zones in the interface region .",
    "photoionization of is very unlikely in such a region since low gas density and large path lengths are required if the photoionization is due to the extragalactic background .",
    "most conductive interface models and the turbulent mixing layer models predict column densities of @xmath501 @xmath21 per conduction front and even less for mixing layers ( if the mixing is slow - i.e. , no shocks ) . magnetic fields parallel to conduction fronts inhibit conduction and result in lower column densities .",
    "these single - interface column densities are approximately an order of magnitude less than those observed ( see table  1 ) .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this .",
    "first , there may be small scale macro - structure ( clumps ) within the clouds that have similar enough velocities that the absorption features from the fragments blend together and can not be distinguished .",
    "the boundary of each fragment would contribute to the total column density , and multiple ( @xmath502 ) boundaries would be required to explain the observed values of @xmath25 ( ) .",
    "the profiles are generally quite broad and are consistent with the presence of multiple , blended components .",
    "second , turbulent mixing in eddy layers in the conduction zone increases the likelihood of more efficient mixing and greater columns .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulations show that the transition - temperature gas layers where should exist are turbulent in nature ( see , e.g. , figure  2 in quilis & moore 2001 ) .",
    "third , there may be an external source of heat that increases the depth of the mixing layer .",
    "the column densities in mixing layers depend on the temperature of the post - mixed gas and on the product of the velocity of the hot gas that enters the mixing layers and the fraction of mass deposited by the hot gas in the turbulent flow ( slavin et al .",
    "1993 ) . in the case",
    "of a cloud moving through a low density medium , the source of heat could be weak shocks or the ram pressure heating itself .",
    "there are numerous examples of stellar tidal streams in the galactic halo ( see majewski , hawley , & munn 1996 ; martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2001 ; newberg et al .",
    "sources of the high velocity material entering the galactic corona might include infalling or tidally disturbed galaxies , such as the sagittarius dwarf ( ibata et al .",
    "tidal interactions of the fragments and galaxies in the local group could drive dynamical instabilities in some of the smaller galaxies and strip interstellar material from gas - rich irregular galaxies ( mayer et al .",
    "since viscous processes affect the gas but not the stars in interacting systems , tracing the original source of the high velocity gas may prove impossible .",
    "however , the fact that no pristine ( zero - metallicity ) hvcs have yet been identified indicates that some previous metal enrichment inside galaxies has probably occurred ( see  7 and table  9 for some potentially low metallicity clouds that require further study ) . in the case of complex  c",
    ", the low metallicity ( @xmath503 ) indicates a history different from that of the interstellar material in the galactic disk .",
    "the column density of within the hot ( @xmath504k ) gas of the corona or local group gas itself is given by @xmath25 ( ) = ( o / h)@xmath303 @xmath207 f@xmath390 @xmath505 , where @xmath506 is the path length through the absorbing gas . at @xmath507k , f@xmath390 @xmath508 ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .",

    "@xmath511 would produce an column density of less than @xmath426 @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the corona would have an column density significantly less than that of the milky way thick disk / halo and would be difficult to detect directly through its absorption . however , if the gas had a higher metallicity ( e.g. , @xmath512 ) , and a higher density ( e.g. , @xmath513 @xmath29 ) , then the amount of expected would be substantial [ @xmath25 ( )  @xmath514 @xmath21 ] even if the corona extended only @xmath515 kpc . such a corona should show x - ray absorption features that may also be detectable ( see  9.1 )",
    ". a possible manifestation of the coronal gas might be very broad , shallow absorption wings like those discussed in  8.1 .",
    "indeed , preliminary results from several authors ( fang & sembach 2002 ; nicastro et al .",
    "2002 ) demonstrate that absorption is present near zero velocity along at least two high latitude sight lines , which is consistent with the presence of a large , nearby reservoir of hot gas .    assuming spherical geometry , a radius @xmath516 kpc , and density @xmath517 , the mass of the hot tenuous gas in the corona is @xmath518 .",
    "if the hot corona is a prolate spheroid with an axial ratio @xmath519 = 2:1 and a semi - minor axis of @xmath520 kpc , then @xmath521 . if the hot medium fills the local group , the mass would exceed @xmath522 .",
    "an alternative source for the high velocity may be that the clouds and any associated fragments are simply condensations within large remnant local group gas structures falling in on the galaxy ( oort 1970 ) .",
    "cosmological structure formation models predict large numbers of cooling fragments embedded in dark matter , and some of these structures should be observable in x - ray absorption ( e.g. , fang et al . 2002 ) or in absorption as the gas cools through the @xmath523k temperature regime .",
    "estimates of the number density of these structures are consistent with the observed igm detection rate ( fang & bryan 2001 ) .",
    "this situation is in many ways analogous to the coronal model developed above because only about 30% of the hot gas is detectable in absorption , while the remaining @xmath524 is too hot to observe ( dav et al .",
    "however , unlike the coronal model in which the cooler gas may be tidal fragments interacting with a galactic corona or local group medium , in this scenario the -bearing gas and hotter gas share a common evolution within isolated evolving structures with no external baryonic medium required ( though dark matter confinement would likely be necessary  see , e.g. , kepner et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "distinguishing between these two models will be difficult , but there are several tests that may yield some additional insight .",
    "metallicity determinations for a substantial number of the high velocity and features would help to distinguish between magellanic debris and lower metallicity ( @xmath525 ) gas expected for a cooling gas structure or debris from smaller local group galaxies .",
    "high - resolution imaging of the h@xmath99 emission from the high velocity absorbers would constrain their relationship with the and perhaps reveal additional signatures of interactions with an extended galactic corona ( e.g. , bow shock structures or turbulently mixed layers of ionized gas between the and hot corona ) . some high velocity clouds",

    "<S> the @xmath15 absorption is detected at @xmath16 confidence along 59 of the 102 sight lines surveyed . </S>",
    "<S> the high velocity detections indicate that @xmath17% of the sky ( and perhaps as much as @xmath18% , depending on data quality considerations ) is covered by high velocity h@xmath19 associated with the . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 @xmath21 if the high velocity hot gas has a metallicity similar to that of the magellanic stream . about 30% of the sky is covered by the hot , high velocity h@xmath19 at a level of @xmath22 @xmath21 , which is similar to the detection rate found for 21 cm emission produced by warm neutral gas at a comparable column density level </S>",
    "<S> . some of the high velocity is associated with known structures ( the magellanic stream , complex  a , complex  c , the outer spiral arm , and several discrete hvcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> some of the high velocity features have no counterpart in 21 cm emission , including discrete absorption features and positive velocity absorption wings extending from @xmath23 to @xmath24 kms@xmath3that blend with lower velocity absorption produced by the galactic thick disk / halo . </S>",
    "<S> the discrete features may typify clouds located in the local group , while the absorption wings may be tidal debris or material expelled from the galactic disk . </S>",
    "<S> most of the features have velocities incompatible with those of the galactic halo , even if the halo has decoupled from the underlying galactic disk . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction in the dispersion about the mean of the high velocity centroids when the velocities are converted from the lsr to the gsr and lgsr reference frames is necessary ( but not conclusive ) evidence that some of the clouds are located outside the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> most of the can not be produced by photoionization , even if the gas is irradiated by extragalactic ultraviolet background radiation . </S>",
    "<S> several observational quantities indicate that collisions in hot gas are the primary ionization mechanism responsible for the production of the . </S>",
    "<S> these include the ratios of column densities to those of other highly ionized species ( , ) and the strong correlation between @xmath25 ( ) and line width . </S>",
    "<S> consideration of the possible sources of collisional ionization favors production of some of the at the boundaries between cool / warm clouds of gas and a highly extended ( @xmath26 kpc ) , hot ( @xmath27k ) , low - density ( @xmath28 @xmath29 ) galactic corona or local group medium . the existence of a hot , highly extended galactic corona or local group medium and the prevalence of high velocity are consistent with predictions of current galaxy formation scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> distinguishing between the various phenomena producing high velocity in and near the galaxy will require continuing studies of the distances , kinematics , elemental abundances , and physical states of the different types of high velocity found in this study . </S>",
    "<S> descriptions of galaxy evolution will need to account for the highly ionized gas , and future x - ray studies of hot gas in the local group will need to consider carefully the relationship of the x - ray absorption / emission to the complex high velocity absorption observed in . </S>"
