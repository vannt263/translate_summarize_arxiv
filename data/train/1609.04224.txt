    "nematic liquid crystals ( nematics ) are characterized by a long range orientational ordering described by the director field @xmath0 , thus representing anisotropic fluids .",
    "the preferred orientation @xmath0 can easily be changed by an electric field @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this process is mostly governed by the typically dominant quadratic dielectric contribution @xmath2 to the free energy of the system . here",
    "@xmath3 is the electric constant and @xmath4 is the dielectric anisotropy ( the difference of permittivities measured along and perpendicular to @xmath0 ) .",
    "the linear with respect to @xmath1 flexoelectric contribution of @xmath5 may also be important @xcite . here",
    "@xmath6 is the flexoelectric polarization induced by splay and bend director deformations , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 being the relevant flexoelectric coefficients .",
    "though a nematic is electrically neutral in its basic state , an inhomogeneous electric charge density @xmath9 may develop in the electric field due to the director deformations ; then a coulomb force @xmath10 arises , which may induce a material flow @xmath11 .    in most experiments and applications thin ( 520 @xmath12 m )",
    "nematic layers are sandwiched between transparent electrodes covered by aligning layers , which ensure a uniform quiescent state . upon applying an electric voltage @xmath13 to the electrodes",
    ", director distortions may occur if @xmath13 exceeds some critical value @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "in many cases , the distortions are uniform in the plane parallel to the substrates .",
    "these electro - optical effects are utilized in liquid crystal displays ( lcds ) .    under some conditions",
    "the applied voltage may induce patterns .",
    "two basic types of patterns can be distinguished : equilibrium director deformations , spatially periodic in the plane of the nematic layers with a wave vector @xmath15 , and dissipative ones , where director distortions are accompanied by vortex flow and are therefore called electroconvection ( ec ) . in this latter phenomenon",
    "electrical conductivity plays a crucial role .",
    "flexoelectric domains ( shortly flexodomains , fd ) induced by dc voltage are a paradigm of the first type . they have been observed by polarizing microscope in planar nematics ( initial homogeneous director orientation @xmath16 is parallel to the confining plates ) as a series of dark and bright stripes running parallel to @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) @xcite . the pattern has been interpreted as a flexoelectricity induced periodic director modulation @xcite : it appears when the free energy reduction due to the flexoelectric polarization overcomes the elastic and dielectric increase of the free energy .",
    "this may only occur if certain relations between the material parameters of the nematic fulfils @xcite .",
    "electroconvection ( ec ) being of dissipative origin may also yield stripe ( roll ) patterns @xcite , however , the orientation of the rolls is different from that of fd : the rolls are either perpendicular to @xmath16 ( normal rolls ) or run at an angle ( oblique rolls ) .",
    "the obliqueness is usually characterized by the angle @xmath18 between @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( typically @xmath19 ) .",
    "the most common example of electroconvection ( standard ec ) is observed in planar nematics having a negative dielectric anisotropy @xmath20 and a positive electrical conductivity anisotropy @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the electrical conductivities measured along and perpendicular to @xmath24 . the driving feedback mechanism , a coupling of spatial director fluctuations to space charge separation and circulation flow , was invented by carr @xcite and helfrich @xcite . for the applied voltage @xmath13 below some critical value @xmath14 the fluctuations decay , however , they grow to a finite amplitude pattern for @xmath25",
    ". the periodic director modulation acts as an optical grating , such that the pattern is easily visualized .",
    "the effects mentioned above can be induced by dc ( @xmath26 ) as well as by ac ( @xmath27 ) applied voltages . in the latter case",
    "@xmath27 corresponds to the rms value of the driving sinusoidal voltage @xmath28 of frequency @xmath29 ; here @xmath30 is the circular frequency .",
    "it was found that the critical ( threshold ) voltages are frequency dependent and the shape of the @xmath31 curves as well as the @xmath29-range of existence depend strongly on the type of the pattern @xcite .",
    "for example , for a typical set of material parameters , fd are seen only at low @xmath29 below a few hz , while ec patterns might be observed up to several ten khz .    by",
    "now theoretical description has been developed to describe the patterns discussed above , which is known as the standard model of electroconvection including flexoelectricity @xcite ( we will refer to it as the extended sm ) .",
    "the linear stability analysis of the extended sm provides the threshold @xmath31 , the critical wave vector @xmath32 and the spatio - temporal dependence of the material flow @xmath33 , the electric potential , and the director @xmath34 at the onset , in a good agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "the equations have solutions of three different types .",
    "one is at dc driving ( we will refer to it as the _ dc - mode _ ) : in this case @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are time independent .",
    "the other two occur at ac driving . for frequencies",
    "@xmath29 below the crossover frequency @xmath38 ( in the _ conductive mode _ ) , in leading order , the director and the velocity are stationary , while the charge density oscillates with @xmath29 . for @xmath39 ( in the _ dielectric mode _ ) , in contrast , @xmath0 and @xmath11 oscillate with the ac frequency in leading order , while @xmath9 is stationary .",
    "it should be noted that due to these differences in time symmetries there is no smooth transition from the ac @xmath40 limit to the dc case @xcite .",
    "the complexity of pattern types and their temporal behaviour justify a special attention to pattern formation driven by a superposition of two voltages ( @xmath41 + @xmath42 ) , which in themselves would induce patterns of different types . at such a combined driving ,",
    "the key questions are : where is the limit of stability of the initial homogeneous state in the @xmath41@xmath42 plane and how does the pattern morphology change when moving along this stability limit curve ( slc ) .    in pioneering works",
    "@xcite , ec under the superposition of a high ( @xmath43 ) and a low ( @xmath44 ) frequency ac voltages with an integer frequency ratio ( @xmath45 ) was studied and at some voltage combinations formation of subharmonic patterns was detected .",
    "the effect of mixing two ac voltages with an arbitrary frequency ratio , however , has not been studied yet .",
    "another interesting case is the superposition of ac and dc voltages , which by symmetry reasons , as we have pointed out above , is not equivalent with the superposition of two ac voltages of frequencies @xmath43 and @xmath46",
    ". experimental studies on electro - optics in nematics at combined ac+dc driving are so far very scarce .",
    "e.g. , the dc threshold of fd was found to increase upon superposing ac voltage in a calamitic @xcite as well as in a bent - core nematic @xcite ; however , the instabilities at pure ac driving or at a small dc bias voltage have not been studied .",
    "combined driving was also applied for the nematic 5cb ( 4-pentyl-4-cyanobiphenyl ) having @xmath47 and @xmath48 and thus exhibiting nonstandard ec @xcite .",
    "the superposition of ac and dc voltages resulted in changes of the thresholds and also in appearance of new pattern morphologies @xcite .",
    "the influence of the combined driving on secondary ec instabilities has been reported in @xcite where the effect of spatiotemporal synchronization of oscillating zig - zag ec rolls under an increase of a dc bias voltage was found .    from theoretical point of view",
    ", the consequences of the combined ac+dc driving are non - trivial , since the underlying nemato - hydrodynamic equations contain terms linear as well as quadratic in the applied voltage .",
    "thus even in the linear stability analysis , the solution may not be obtained as a simple superposition of the three basic modes of different time dynamics .",
    "recently , using the extended sm , the slc as well as the wave vector @xmath15 along the slc have been calculated for four basic cases when changing from pure dc to pure ac voltage @xcite : ( a ) dc - mode of ec at dc voltage and conductive ec mode at ac voltage with @xmath49 ; ( b ) dc - mode of ec at dc voltage and dielectric ec mode at ac voltage with @xmath39 ; ( c ) fd at dc voltage and conductive ec mode at ac voltage with @xmath49 ; ( d ) fd at dc voltage and dielectric ec mode at ac voltage with @xmath39 .",
    "the calculations predicted closed slc connecting the ac and dc threshold voltages for all cases . in case a the obtained slc was smooth and convex , the superposed threshold was always lower than the pure ac or dc ones , and @xmath15 varied continuously from its ac to the dc value .",
    "in contrast to that , in cases b to d the slc exhibited a protrusion toward larger dc voltages .",
    "moreover , in those cases the slc had a break indicating a sharp transition between patterns with different magnitude and/or direction of the wave vectors .",
    "the above theoretical results have been compared with experiments , which explored the influence of combined ac+dc driving on standard ec in a nematic mixture ( merck phase 5 ) @xcite .",
    "a comparison of experimental data with theoretical predictions yielded a good match for case a , however , only at the lowest frequencies @xcite . at higher frequencies or in cases",
    "b to d , measurements indicated a substantial increase of the ac threshold upon superposing dc voltage ; an effect becoming more pronounced with increasing the frequency of the ac component . in extreme cases ( in the dielectric regime ) it resulted in the opening of the slc : the superposed ac and dc voltage reached the upper limit of the voltage source without inducing pattern , even though the voltage(s ) exceeded several times the pure ac or dc thresholds ( see fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "later , in section [ sec : discussion ] , we provide an explanation of this pattern inhibition .",
    "our measurements were performed using a nematic liquid crystals exhibiting standard ec at ac driving and fd at dc voltage , thus allowing an experimental check of the theoretical predictions for cases c and d.    the paper is organized as follows . after introducing our set - up , experimental methods , and the studied compound in section  [ sec : setup ] , we present our results ( experimental as well as theoretical ) in section  [ sec : results ] , reporting on various pattern forming scenarios and on electric current measurements .",
    "these results are further analyzed in section  [ sec : discussion ] and the paper is finally closed with conclusions in section  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "the compound selected for the studies , 4-n - octyloxyphenyl 4-n - methyloxybenzoate ( 1oo8 ) , has nematic phase in the temperature range between 53 @xmath50c and 77 @xmath50c @xcite .",
    "its chemical structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1oo8 ] .",
    "it has negative dielectric and positive conductivity anisotropies ; hence standard ec develops at pure ac driving . at pure dc voltage , depending on the sample thickness @xmath51 and on the electrical conductivity , it exhibits either flexodomains @xcite or standard ec .",
    "the liquid crystal was filled into commercial cells ( @xmath52 @xmath12 m , wat , poland and @xmath53 @xmath12 m , ehc .",
    "co , japan ) ; rubbed polyimide coatings on the transparent electrodes ensured a planar initial alignment of the nematic .",
    "the cell was placed into a temperature controlled compartment ( a linkam lts350 hot - stage with a tms 94 controller ) ; experiments were performed at the temperature @xmath54 @xmath50c , i.e. , well in the nematic phase range .",
    "the voltage applied to the cell was provided by the function generator output of a tiepie handyscope hs3 digital oscilloscope through a high voltage amplifier .",
    "it allowed to synthesize the driving voltage in the form of @xmath55 with arbitrary @xmath56 ratios .",
    "the two oscilloscope channels of the same device were used to record simultaneously the signals of the applied voltage and the current flowing through the cell , thus providing information on the sample impedance during pattern formation .",
    "the voltage - induced patterns were observed by a polarizing microscope ( leica dm rxp ) at white light illumination using a single polarizer ( shadowgraph @xcite technique ) .",
    "an attached digital camera , mikrotron eosens mc1362 , was used to record snapshot sequences for documentation and/or later digital processing .",
    "it was capable of high speed imaging at a variable ( maximum 2000 frames / s ) rate with a spatial resolution of 520 * 512 pixels at 256 grey levels .",
    "a specially designed trigger logic was applied to synchronize image recording of the high speed camera with the zero crossing of the ac component of the applied voltage .",
    "thus the temporal behaviour could be monitored by taking 204000 snapshots ( depending on @xmath29 ) within a driving period .",
    "measurements were computer controlled using labview .    digital processing of the recorded images allowed determination of the wave vector @xmath15 of the pattern ( using two - dimensional fft ) as well as of the pattern contrast @xmath57 which we defined as the mean square deviation of the intensity , @xmath58 ( here @xmath59 is the intensity of a pixel , and @xmath60 denotes averaging over the whole image ) .",
    "this definition satisfactorily discriminates the initial ( undistorted ) and the patterned state , though it does not allow distinguishing between various pattern morphologies .    for the precise measurements of the sample impedance , a dielectric analyser ( novocontrol alpha equipped with a zg4 test interface )",
    "was also employed . in order to obtain the values of the anisotropy of the dielectric permittivity and the electrical conductivity , the thermostated sample ( a commercial cell of @xmath53 @xmath12 m )",
    "was put into an electromagnet with the magnetic induction @xmath61 perpendicular to the confining electrodes , i.e. , perpendicular to the initial planar director orientation @xmath16 . at @xmath62 , the components @xmath63 and @xmath23 ( perpendicular to @xmath0 ) could be obtained .",
    "as the compound has a positive magnetic susceptibility anisotropy @xmath64 , increasing the magnetic field above @xmath65 a freedericksz transition is induced resulting in a quasi - homeotropic state with the director orientation nearly parallel to the magnetic field at high @xmath66 , thus allowing to estimate the components @xmath67 and @xmath22 ( parallel to @xmath0 ) . here",
    "@xmath68 is the vacuum permeability and @xmath69 is the splay elastic constant .",
    "unfortunately , due to @xmath70 , the dc bias voltage @xmath26 has a dielectric stabilizing effect acting against the magnetic field , hence increasing the magnetic freedericksz threshold according to @xmath71^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath72 for large dc bias voltage , a cell with a thickness of @xmath73 mm was constructed .",
    "in this cell , the polyimide coating on the ito electrodes was unrubbed , as at such a thickness the surface interactions can not provide a uniform orientation in the bulk . instead , during the impedance measurements the magnetic field",
    "was kept switched on continuously at @xmath74 and the cell was rotated alternately to the positions with @xmath61 parallel to the substrates ( @xmath63 and @xmath23 are measurable ) and @xmath61 perpendicular to the substrates ( yielding @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "the planarly aligned 1oo8 exhibits flexodomains as a first instability at pure dc driving , while it shows ec patterns when driven with ac voltage @xcite . in section [ sec:1oo8 ]",
    "we explore how superposition of dc and ac voltages alters the pattern morphologies , the onset characteristics ( @xmath14 and @xmath77 ) and their frequency dependence , and up to what combination of the superposed voltages the uniform state can prevail . in section [ sec : anticipation ]",
    "our theoretical considerations are presented in comparison with the experimental findings .",
    "finally we report in section [ sec : current ] on the results of the conductivity measurements , that are essential for understanding the phenomena under scope .         of ec in 1oo8 at various dc bias voltages @xmath26 in the frequency range of 5 hz @xmath78 hz . the vertical black arrow indicates the crossover frequency @xmath38 between conductive ( opel symbols ) and dielectric ( solid symbols ) ec regimes for @xmath79 . at @xmath80 only dielectric ec is observable.,width=302 ]    figure [ fig:1oo8_vac(f , vdc ) ] presents the frequency dependence of the ac threshold voltages @xmath81 of a @xmath52 @xmath12 m thick cell , for pure ac ( @xmath79 ) as well as for different dc bias voltages up to @xmath82 v. for pure ac driving one sees the usual scenario of standard ec : conductive regime at low @xmath29 and dielectric regime above the crossover frequency @xmath83 hz ( see the vertical black arrow in fig .

    "note that since 1oo8 exhibits flexodomains for pure dc voltage driving at @xmath84  v ( green arrow in fig .",
