    "several recent astrophysical observations @xcite have provided the astonishing result that around @xmath1@xmath2 of the content of the universe is in the form of dark matter @xmath3 dark energy , with only about @xmath4@xmath5 being represented by baryonic matter .",
    "more intriguing , around @xmath6 of the energy - density may be in the form of what is called `` dark energy '' , and is responsible for the acceleration of the distant type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "hence , today s models of astrophysics and cosmology face two severe problems , that can be summarized as the dark energy problem , and the dark matter problem , respectively .",
    "although in recent years many different suggestions have been proposed to overcome these issues , a satisfactory answer has yet to be obtained .",
    "a very promising way to explain these major problems is to assume that at large scales the einstein gravity model of general relativity breaks down , and a more general action describes the gravitational field .",
    "theoretical models in which the standard einstein - hilbert action is replaced by an arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath7 , first proposed in @xcite , have been extensively investigated lately .",
    "the only restriction imposed on the function @xmath8 is to be analytic , that is , it must possess a taylor series expansion about any point .",
    "cosmic acceleration can be explained by @xmath0 gravity @xcite , and the conditions of viable cosmological models have been derived in @xcite . in the context of the solar system regime , severe weak field constraints seem to rule out most of the models proposed so far @xcite , although viable models do exist @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the galactic dynamic of massive test particles can be understood without the need for dark matter was also considered in the framework of @xmath9 gravity models @xcite , and connections with mond and the pioneer anomaly further explored by considering an explicit coupling of an arbitrary function of @xmath7 with the matter lagrangian density @xcite .",
    "for a recent review of the @xmath0 modified gravity models see @xcite .",
    "the study of the static spherically symmetric vacuum solutions of the gravitational field theories is fundamental for the physical understanding and interpretation of the model .",
    "in particular , the vacuum solutions provide the theoretical basis for the solar system testing of the theories , and for the description of the motion of the test particles around massive bodies .",
    "it was shown that for a large class of models , including e.g.  the @xmath10 model , the schwarzschild - de sitter metric is an exact solution of the field equations .",
    "solutions in the presence of a perfect fluid were analyzed in @xcite .",
    "other approaches in searching for exact spherically symmetric solutions of @xmath0 theories of gravity were studied in @xcite , respectively .",
    "several exact vacuum static and spherically symmetric solutions of the gravitational field equations in @xmath0 gravity were obtained in @xcite .",
    "the set of the modified einstein s field equations were reduced to a single , third order differential equation , and it was shown how one can construct exact solutions in different @xmath0 models .",
    "in particular , a schwarzschild type solution of the field equation was constructed .",
    "this solution , containing a term linearly increasing with the radial coordinate , as well as a logarithmic term , depends on four new arbitrary integration constants , and reduces to the standard general relativistic case by imposing the zero value to one integration constant , and by appropriately choosing the numerical values of the other constants .",
    "however , even that this choice of constants allows the model to pass the solar system tests , we expect that at large distances , or in the presence of strong gravitational fields , the geometry of the space - time in @xmath0 modified gravity models is different from that of standard general relativity . therefore , it is important to find a method that could allow one to observationally distinguish , and test in an astrophysical setting , the possible deviations from einstein s theory .",
    "one such possibility is the study of accretion disks around compact objects .",
    "most of the astrophysical bodies grow substantially in mass via accretion .",
    "recent observations suggest that around almost all of the active galactic nuclei ( agn s ) , or black hole candidates , there exist gas clouds surrounding the central compact object , together with an associated accretion disc , on a variety of scales from a tenth of a parsec to a few hundred parsecs @xcite .",
    "these gas clouds are assumed to form a geometrically and optically thick torus ( or warped disc ) , which absorbs most of the ultraviolet radiation and the soft x - rays .",
    "the gas exists in either the molecular or the atomic phase .",
    "the most powerful evidence for the existence of super massive black holes comes from the vlbi imaging of molecular @xmath11 masers in the active galaxy ngc 4258 @xcite .",
    "this imaging , produced by doppler shift measurements assuming keplerian motion of the masering source , has allowed a quite accurate estimation of the central mass , which has been found to be a @xmath12 super massive dark object , within @xmath13 parsecs .",
    "hence , important astrophysical information can be obtained from the observation of the motion of the gas streams in the gravitational field of compact objects .",
    "the mass accretion around rotating black holes was studied in general relativity for the first time in @xcite . by using an equatorial approximation to the stationary and axisymmetric space - time of rotating black holes ,",
    "steady - state thin disk models were constructed , extending the theory of non - relativistic accretion @xcite . in these models",
    "hydrodynamical equilibrium is maintained by efficient cooling mechanisms via radiation transport , and the accreting matter has a keplerian rotation .",
    "the radiation emitted by the disk surface was also studied under the assumption that black body radiation would emerge from the disk in thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "the radiation properties of the thin accretion disks were further analyzed in @xcite and in @xcite , where the effects of the photon capture by the hole on the spin evolution were presented as well . in these works the efficiency",
    "with which black holes convert rest mass into outgoing radiation in the accretion process was also computed .",
    "later on , the emissivity properties of the accretion disks were investigated for exotic central objects , such as non - rotating or rotating quark , boson or fermion stars @xcite . the radiation power per unit area ,",
    "the temperature of the disk and the spectrum of the emitted radiation were given , and compared with the case of a schwarzschild black hole of an equal mass .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to study the thin accretion disk models applied for black holes in @xmath0 modified gravity models , and carry out an analysis of the properties of the radiation emerging from the surface of the disk .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",

    "iii we review the formalism of the thin disk accretion onto compact objects .",

    "the physical parameters of the disc - effective potential , flux and emission spectrum profiles - have been explicitly obtained for several values of the parameters characterizing the vacuum solution of the generalized field equations .",
    "all the astrophysical quantities , related to the observable properties of the accretion disc , can be obtained from the black hole metric . due to the differences in the space - time structure , the modified @xmath0 gravity black holes present some very important differences with respect to the disc properties as compared to the standard general relativistic schwarzschild case .    the determination of the accretion rate for an astrophysical object can give a strong evidence for the existence of a surface of the object . a model",
    "in which sgr a * , the @xmath217 super massive black hole candidate at the galactic center , may be a compact object with a thermally emitting surface was considered in @xcite . for very compact surfaces within the photon orbit ,",
    "the thermal assumption is likely to be a good approximation because of the large number of rays that are strongly gravitationally lensed back onto the surface . given the very low quiescent luminosity of sgr a * in the near - infrared , the existence of a hard surface , even in the limit in which the radius approaches the horizon , places a severe constraint on the steady mass accretion rate onto the source , @xmath218 yr@xmath219 .",

    "since , as one can see from table  [ efficiency ] , the conversion efficiency in the case of the @xmath0 vacuum solutions is different as compared to the general relativistic case , the determination of this parameter could discriminate , at least in principle , between the different gravity theories , and constrain the parameters of the model .",
