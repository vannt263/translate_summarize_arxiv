    "the main thesis of the present paper is that in some important situations that naturally arise in mathematics an explicit consideration of the functor @xmath8 defined by components of products , is conceptually advantageous .",
    "it plays in some sense a complementary or dual role to the @xmath9 functor and should be thought of as the truth value of the proposition  @xmath4 meets @xmath2 \" , in the same sense according to which @xmath10 may be tought of as the truth value of the proposition ",
    "@xmath4 is included in @xmath2 \" ( see sections  [ two ] and  [ preorders ] ) .",
    "specifically , in the above situation , the functor @xmath11 gives rise to another interpretation of any object @xmath2 of @xmath3 as a ( covariant ) presheaf on @xmath0 , the  cointerpretation \" of @xmath2 via @xmath11 , whose @xmath4-elements , namely the components of @xmath12 in @xmath13 , may be called  cofigures \" of @xmath2 with shape @xmath4 .",

    ", if @xmath3 is @xmath14 , the category of ( irreflexive ) graphs , then appropriate choices of @xmath11 lead to the interpretation of a graph as various sets ( such as the sets of its nodes , its arrows , its loops ) or as various mappings between these sets ( such as the inclusion of loops in arrows , or the domain and codomain mappings ) and so on . on the other hand , a graph can be cointerpreted as the set of its components , as the set of its nodes ( once again , since the dot graph is an  atom \" ; see later ) , as the mapping which takes a node to its component , and so on .",
    "while it is easy to find  small \" adequate subcategories of @xmath14 ( typically the full one generated by the dot and the arrow ) , even the identity functor is not coadequate for @xmath14 ( e.g. , a graph can not be distinguished from its thin reflection by  tensoring \" with other graphs ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the  right endomappings \" , that is the graphs with a bijective domain mapping , _ are _ coadequate for the subcategory of  left endomappings \" ( with bijective codomain ) . furthermore",
    ", if @xmath15 is the monoid of the natural numbers and @xmath16 is the functor given by the action of @xmath15 on the infinite chain @xmath17 by translations , then the corresponding interpretation and cointerpretation give the coreflection of graphs in right endomappings and the reflection in left endomappings respectively ( this example is treated in detail in section  [ endomappings ] ) .",
    "since various situations display analogous features , it seems appropriate to condense them in the following definition of a * bipolar space * @xmath18    1 .",
    "@xmath19 is a category with tensor ( see section  [ components ] ) and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are full replete subcategories of @xmath19 .",
    "the objects of @xmath19 are the * parts * of the space @xmath22 and those in @xmath20 or in @xmath21 are called * open * and * closed * parts , or also  left mappings \" and  right mappings \" , respectively .",
    "[ neg ] if @xmath23 , then there is a * complement * or * negation * functor @xmath24 right adjoint to @xmath25 : @xmath26 which takes values in @xmath21 ; and dually , any closed part has an open complement ( that is , with open values ) .",
    "often the bipolar spaces considered are * strong * , in that the following stronger property holds : for any open @xmath4 and closed @xmath27 , the exponential object @xmath28 exists in @xmath19 and is itself closed , and vice versa .",
    "3 .   open and closed parts are reciprocally coadequate . as shown in section  [ coadequacy ] , this is equivalent to the fact that the complement - negation is classical , in that the strong contraposition law @xmath29 holds , for @xmath4 and @xmath2 both open or both closed ; so open or closed parts can be  recovered \" from their nagation .",
    "4 .   @xmath20 and @xmath21 are both reflective and coreflective in @xmath19 , with reflections @xmath30 and coreflections @xmath31 as a consequence we have the natural isomorphisms @xmath32 @xmath33 for parts @xmath34 and @xmath35 of @xmath22 ; while the former are obvious , the latter follow from point  [ neg ] above , as will be shown in section  [ components ] .",
    "the last axiom is in fact a very strong requirement ; e.g. it excludes , in the two - valued case , general topological spaces ( see section  [ preorders ] ) .",
    "anyhow , it should be clear which hypothesis are really needed in the various part of the subsequent theory .    the key example is @xmath36 , the bipolar space associated to a category @xmath22 , which has @xmath37 , while @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the full subcategories of discrete fibrations and discrete opfibrations over @xmath22 respectively ; so @xmath40 has categories over @xmath22 as parts , and a part is open ( respectively closed ) iff it is a discrete fibration ( respectively , a discrete opfibration ) .    among the parts of @xmath40 , the objects @xmath41 of @xmath22 have the special property that for any open part @xmath4 and any closed part @xmath27 @xmath42 since all of them reduce to the objects or components of a discrete category , namely the fibre of @xmath4 or @xmath27 over @xmath43 ; moreover , both the bijections are mediated by the same universal element in @xmath44 and so any object @xmath45 is an  atom \" ( see sections  [ atoms ] and  [ atomcat ] ) . the reflections @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the discrete fibrations @xmath48 and @xmath49 of objects over and under @xmath43 , and correspond to the representable functors @xmath50 and @xmath51 , the required adjunctions being provided by the yoneda lemma .",
    "similarly , any idempotent @xmath52 in @xmath22 , as a part of @xmath40 , is an atom whose reflections @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the adjoint bimodules associated to @xmath52 in the cauchy completion of @xmath22 , and we shall see in section  [ atomcat2 ] that the same is true for the reflections of any atom @xmath55 .",
    "similarly , in a two - valued context , for any poset @xmath22 we have the bipolar space @xmath56 which has as parts the parts ( that is , subsets ) of the underlying set of @xmath22 , and a part is open ( respectively closed ) iff it is a sieve ( respectively , a cosieve ) . here",
    "the ( strong ) atoms are the parts with a single element .",
    "if @xmath22 is a graph , we also have a bipolar space @xmath57 , having as open ( respectively closed ) parts those graphs over @xmath22 which are  left \" ( respectively  right \" ) functional over any arrow of @xmath22 . here",
    "the atoms are the nodes of @xmath22 as graphs over @xmath22 .    in general ,",
    "given a bipolar space @xmath22 , there are two categories @xmath58 and @xmath59 with the atoms @xmath60 as objects and with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and the obvious full and faithful functors @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , there is a duality @xmath65 and the corresponding interpretation and cointerpretation of open parts as presheaves on @xmath58 and as covariant presheaves on @xmath59 are equivalent modulo this isomorphism . indeed ,",
    "for any open part @xmath4 and any atom @xmath43 , equations  ( [ f1 ] ) ,  ( [ f2 ] ) and  ( [ f3 ] ) above induce bijections @xmath66 that define a natural isomorphism @xmath67 as shown in section  [ atoms ] .",
    "symmetrically , any closed part @xmath27 is ( co)interpreted as a functor @xmath68 in two distinct but equivalent ways : @xmath69 if the bipolar space @xmath22 is  atomic \" , that is if @xmath58 is adequate for @xmath20 and @xmath59 is adequate for @xmath21 ( or , equivalently , @xmath58 is coadequate for @xmath21 and @xmath59 is coadequate for @xmath20 ) , then open and closed parts  are \" presheaves on @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in particular , the reflection @xmath70 of a part @xmath71  is \" the functor @xmath68 defined by @xmath72 for any @xmath73 in @xmath58 , and similarly @xmath74  is \" a functor @xmath75 : @xmath76 for any @xmath77 in @xmath59 . using the  ( [ f2 ] ) we get the isomorphisms of functors @xmath78 similarly , using the interpretation instead of the cointerpretation and",
    "the  ( [ f1 ] ) instead of the  ( [ f2 ] ) , we get the following formulas for the coreflections : @xmath79 so , in an atomic space @xmath22 , @xmath70 is obtained as the cointerpretation of @xmath34 via @xmath63 , while @xmath80 is obtained as the interpretation of @xmath34 via @xmath64 ( and dually for @xmath74 and @xmath81 ) .",
    "this applies to @xmath40 , where @xmath22 is a category or a graph . in the case of graphs we find in particular the formulas for the reflection and the coreflection of graphs in endomappings , touched upon at the beginning of this introduction .",
    "indeed , if @xmath82 is the terminal graph the only atom in @xmath83 is the dot @xmath84 , its reflections are the chains @xmath17 or @xmath85 and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the full subcategories of their endomorphisms , which as categories are isomorphic to the monoid @xmath15 of natural numbers .      after introducing categories with tensor in section  [ tensor ] , where also the two - valued case is considered , and atoms in section  [ atoms ] , in the next three sections we discuss examples of bipolar spaces",
    ".    sections  [ graphs ] and  [ preorders ] are mainly intended as a sort of extended introduction . in the former we present two particularly pregnant instances of spaces @xmath40 associated to a graph @xmath22 , namely we consider @xmath86 and @xmath83 , where @xmath87 are the arrow and the loop respectively .",
    "the latter is devoted to the most typical kind of bipolar spaces in the two - valued context , the spaces @xmath40 associated to a poset @xmath22 ; they coincide essentially with the alexandrov topological spaces .",
    "the central example , which may be seen as the alexandrov space associated to a category @xmath22 , is presented in section  [ categories ] , where in particular the properties of atoms in @xmath40 are proved .",
    "we show in section  [ reflections ] that the formulas  ( [ r1 ] ) and  ( [ r2 ] ) above give indeed the expected reflections and coreflections of a category @xmath34 over @xmath22 in the discrete ( op)fibrations .    in section  [ doctrines ] we define  continuous maps \" , the arrows of the category @xmath88 of bipolar spaces , so that @xmath40 becomes the object mapping of a ( pseudo)functor @xmath89 . in the other direction , @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 )",
    "will also be extended to a functor @xmath90 . as sketched before , @xmath91 gives  the \" cauchy completion of the category @xmath22 ; coherently , in the two - valued context , @xmath91 is equivalent to the poset @xmath22 .",
    "similarly , there are functors @xmath92 and @xmath93 , where @xmath94 denotes the category of reflexive graphs ; in these cases @xmath91 gives the free category on @xmath22 .",
    "the connections with kan extensions of set functors will be also dealt with .    in the appendix , after briefly considering reflections and coreflections in discrete bifibrations ( and more generally in ",
    "clopen \" parts ) , we outline to what extent a definition of functionality via cofigures differs from the usual one via orthogonality of figures , and finally we hint at possible directions for further research .",
    "the study of similar  bipolar \" situations , and in particular of that of section  [ categories ] , has been carried out from a different viewpoint in  @xcite ; the fact that discrete fibrations on a category @xmath0 are reflective in the category of categories over @xmath0 was treated in  @xcite and  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) ; the fact that they are coreflective too , although presumably widely known as well , has not appeared in a published form to the author s knowledge .",
    "the general attitude is in the spirit of lawvere s  generalized logic \" ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) ; also the viewpoint of section  [ doctrines ] is cleary borrowed from lawvere ( see in particular  @xcite ) , whose ideas have strongly influenced those of the author ; the resulting doctrines @xmath40 are a sort of temporal doctrines ( see section  [ abstractions ] ) .",
    "in this section and in the next one we build the conceptual frame sketched in the introduction , by developing the necessary tools .",
    "we say that a category @xmath0 * has components * ( or that @xmath0 is a category * with components * ) if there are functors @xmath95 called the * components * , the * discrete * and the * points * functor , respectively . the objects of @xmath0 isomorphic to those of form @xmath96 ( for a set @xmath97 ) are said to be * discrete * or * constant * , while elements of @xmath98 are called points and those of @xmath99 * components * ( or also * copoints * ) of the object @xmath7 . if @xmath0 is a category with components , then it is such in an essentially unique way , since in this case @xmath100 is terminal in @xmath0 , @xmath96 is the copower @xmath101 ( that is the sum of @xmath102 copies of @xmath103 ) and the points functor is represented by @xmath103 .    if @xmath0 is a category with components which is also cartesian ( meaning that it has finite limits ) , we define the functor @xmath104 by components following products , that is @xmath105 and we say that @xmath0 * has tensor * ( or that @xmath0 is a category * with tensor * ) .",
    "the elements of @xmath106 can be called * cofigures * of @xmath2 with shape @xmath4 ( or also , because of the symmetry of @xmath107 , cofigures of @xmath4 with shape @xmath2 ) .",
    "note that we are using the prefix  co \" also to distinguish the concepts which refer to the @xmath107 functor from the corresponding ones relative to the @xmath108 functor .",
    "any presheaf category has tensor , @xmath109 and @xmath110 being the limit and colimit functors to @xmath111 ; in particular , if @xmath112 is a monoid and @xmath22 is an @xmath112-set , the points of @xmath22 are the fixed points of the corresponding action of @xmath112 and its components are the orbits . if @xmath112 is commutative , then the unit @xmath113 has a specially simple form : @xmath114 iff @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) , while , if @xmath112 is a group , @xmath117 has the even simpler form @xmath114 iff @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) . as an exemple ,",
    "consider a group @xmath120 and the left action of @xmath120 on itself ; as any representable functor , the @xmath120-set @xmath120 is connected ( that is @xmath121 ) while @xmath122 is ( the underlying set of ) @xmath120 .",
    "more interestingly , if @xmath123 is the monoid of natural numbers with addition , @xmath124 can be seen as the set of integer numbers since @xmath125 iff either @xmath126 and @xmath127 or @xmath128 and @xmath129 , for a natural number @xmath130 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath131 is the multiplicative monoid of non zero natural numbers then @xmath132 can be seen as the set of ( non zero ) rational numbers , obtained as a quotient of the set of fractions @xmath133 .",
    "if @xmath0 is also ( cartesian ) closed , that is if there is an adjunction @xmath134 with parameter @xmath7 , then the dual or complementary roles played by the functors @xmath135 and @xmath136 are more evident , as summarized in the following    [ closed ] let @xmath0 be a closed category with tensor , then @xmath137 the last two being adjunctions with parameter @xmath7 .",
    "note that equations  ( [ 1 ] ) and  ( [ 2 ] ) hold in the non closed case too , with the exception of the first of  ( [ 2 ] ) which may have no meaning .",
    "in general , the copower functor @xmath138 , left adjoint to the representable @xmath139 , may exist without being given by the formula displayed in equation  ( [ 4 ] ) ( as in the case of categories with a zero object , when the functors @xmath110 , @xmath140 and @xmath109 become constant ) . on the other hand , if the right adjoint to the ",
    "corepresentable functor \" @xmath141 exists , then it is easily seen to have the form  ( [ 3 ] ) . in this case , that is if @xmath7 is exponentiable for constant bases , we call the functor @xmath24 the * negation * or * complement * of @xmath4 , and say that @xmath4  has negation \" or  complement \" ( in  @xcite a similar definition of negation is given ) . note that @xmath142 .",
    "it is worth stressing that non isomorphic objects may corepresent isomorphic functors ( and so , in particular , may have isomorphic negations ) , since a category need not to be coadequate for itself ( see section  [ coadequacy ] ) .",
    "an example , already mentioned in the introduction , is given by two graphs in @xmath14 with the same thin reflection or , more dramatically , by any two _ reflexive _ graph with the same number of components ( see section  [ space ] ) .",
    "in the two - valued setting ( see section  [ two ] ) more familiar examples are given by elements of heyting algebras with the same pseudocomplement ( such as the open subsets of @xmath143 obtained taking off a finite number of points ) .",
    "in presence of distributivity , the property of having tensor becomes stable :    [ slice ] let @xmath0 be a distributive category with tensor , then any slice @xmath144 has tensor .",
    "furthermore , the tensor functor @xmath145 preserves sums in each argument : @xmath146    since @xmath144 is still cartesian and has copowers , we only have to show that there is a component functor @xmath110 left adjoint to @xmath140 . indeed observe that , by distributivity , @xmath147 gives the copower @xmath101 of the terminal @xmath148 in @xmath144 ; so , by composition of adjoints , @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the  total \" functor , left adjoint to @xmath151 .",
    "the proof of the last statement is immediate , since both @xmath152 and @xmath110 preserve sums .",
    "we now illustrate some of the interactions between the axioms for bipolar spaces , in particular those concerning the tensor functor and ( co)reflectivity .",
    "we begin with a proof of the  coadjunction \" property mentioned in the introduction ( corollary  [ coadj ] ) and conclude with some remarks about exponentiability .",
    "let @xmath0 be a category with tensor and let @xmath153 be a full reflective subcategory of @xmath0 , with reflection @xmath154 ; if @xmath155 has a negation - complement @xmath156 with values in @xmath153 , then the unit @xmath117 of the reflection induces ( natural ) bijections @xmath157    the result follows from yoneda and the following chain of bijections , natural in all variables : @xmath158 a more careful inspection shows that the bijections are in fact induced by the unit of the reflection .",
    "since in a bipolar space @xmath159 every open part in @xmath160 has a closed complement @xmath161 , and conversely , and since the full subcategories @xmath20 and @xmath21 of @xmath19 have reflections @xmath162 and @xmath163 , then the above lemma applies to give    [ pcoadj ] given a bipolar space @xmath22 , there are bijections @xmath164 natural in @xmath71 , @xmath160 and @xmath165 .",
    "furthermore , the bijections are induced by the units @xmath166 and @xmath167 of the open and closed reflections @xmath168 and @xmath169 respectively .",
    "[ coadj ] if @xmath34 and @xmath35 are parts of a bipolar space , there are natural isomorphisms @xmath170    so @xmath169 and @xmath168 are  coadjoint \" functors .",
    "note however that the remark following proposition  [ closed ] implies that coadjoint functors do not determine each other up to isomorphisms .",
    "in proposition  [ slice ] we showed a stability property of categories with tensor ; another one is the following    [ proptop ] if @xmath0 is a category with tensor and @xmath153 is a reflective and coreflective full replete subcategory of @xmath0 , then @xmath153 has itself tensor , the points , discrete and components functors being the  same \" as those of @xmath0 .    indeed , @xmath153 is closed with respect to the limits and colimits which exist in @xmath0 and so these serve as limits and colimits for @xmath153 too ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath153 is cartesian and has copowers , and so the discrete functor @xmath171 takes values in @xmath0 ; the points and the components functor for @xmath153 can then be obtained by restricting those of @xmath0",
    ". then in the above situation the inclusion functor preserves the tensor functor ( as well as the @xmath108 functor ) : if @xmath4 and @xmath2 are objects of @xmath153 @xmath172 returning to bipolar spaces , the above proposition applies to the subcategories @xmath20 and @xmath21 of @xmath19 , giving    [ top ] the categories of open and closed parts of a bipolar space @xmath22 have themselves tensor , and the points , components and tensor functors therein are the restriction of the corresponding ones in @xmath19 . limits and colimits of open or closed parts which exist in @xmath19 are again open or closed , respectively ; in particular the constant - discrete parts are both open and closed .    in the same hypothesis of proposition  [ proptop ]",

    "so we have    [ clopen ] in a bipolar space @xmath175 , if @xmath2 and @xmath27 are closed parts and @xmath176 exists in @xmath19 , then @xmath177 gives the exponential in @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath22 is a strong bipolar space , @xmath2 is a clopen part ( that is , both closed and open ) and @xmath27 is closed , then the closed part @xmath176 is also the exponential @xmath176 in @xmath21 .",

    "if @xmath417 is the full subcategory of @xmath14 generated by the dot @xmath338 and the arrow , then @xmath417 is adequate for @xmath14 , which can be seen as the category of presheaves on it : a graph @xmath368 is determined by its arrows @xmath463 , its nodes @xmath464 , and the domain and codomain mappings @xmath465 .    on the other hand , @xmath417 is not coadequate .",
    "in fact , since @xmath466 , we have a notion of  dual graph \" @xmath467 , corresponding to the cointerpretation of a graph @xmath34 via the inclusion of @xmath417 in @xmath14 : @xmath468 , while @xmath469 .",
    "for example , the dual of the dot is the arrow , and in general , if @xmath470 then @xmath471 ; the dual of a right endomapping ( see below ) is the opposite left endomapping .",
    "note also that any graph and its thin reflection have the same dual graphs , and that duality preserves sums ( in fact any colimit ) but not products ( as that of the dot with itself ) .",
    "again , right and left endomapping are defined by orthogonality with respect to @xmath376 and @xmath377 , and the resulting subcategories @xmath472 and @xmath473 may be seen as induced by the functors from @xmath417 to @xmath15 ( the monoid of natural numbers ) which send @xmath411 to @xmath474 and @xmath412 to @xmath475 , or the other way round ; so , by kan extensions , they are reflective and coreflective in @xmath14 .",

    "indeed , recall that the total functor is left adjoint to @xmath482 and so the morphisms @xmath483 correspond to morphisms @xmath484 in @xmath387 , and observe that the effect of multiplying a right ( or left ) endomapping by the arrow @xmath375 , is that of displaying it as a right ( or left ) mapping in @xmath387 .    in particular , given a set @xmath102 , @xmath437 is the right endomapping @xmath485 for any mapping @xmath486 .",

    "we end this section with some examples of reflection and coreflection of graphs on endomappings which are easily  computed \" with the above formulas ( for the reflections , it may be useful to sketch on a piece of paper a portion of the product @xmath503 to understand how @xmath70 works ) :    1 .",
    "[ ex1 ] among the chains , the only ( right ) endomappings are @xmath381 ( the empty graph ) and @xmath504 : the @xmath378 are not endomappings because they have a node which is not the domain of any arrow .",

    "in this section we present the two - valued bipolar space @xmath56 associated to a poset @xmath22 , which is the two - valued version of the main exemple to be studied in the next section .",
    "the connection with alexandrov spaces is considered , and it is shown how the formulas for reflections and coreflections of parts are also suggestive for general topological spaces .",
    "recall that , given a poset @xmath22 , a sieve or lower set of @xmath22 is a @xmath201-valued presheaf @xmath516 , or equivalently a subset @xmath4 of @xmath22 such that @xmath517 and @xmath518 implies @xmath519 ; cosieves ( or upper sets ) are defined dually .",

    "@xmath521 has tensor , with @xmath522 iff @xmath34 meets @xmath35 , that is iff they have a non empty intersection .",
    "since a part of @xmath22 is a sieve iff its complement in @xmath521 is a cosieve , each open part has a closed complement , and vice versa .",
    "the complement is classical , since @xmath352 is in fact a boolean algebra .",
    "since the inclusion of the discrete poset with the same elements ( objects ) of @xmath22 in @xmath22 itself induces the inclusion of @xmath20 in @xmath521 , by kan extensions the former is reflective and coreflective in the latter , and similarly for @xmath21 .",
    "5 .   since , given @xmath160 and @xmath165 , the relative complement @xmath28 in the boolean algebra @xmath521",
    "is given by @xmath523 , the bipolar space @xmath40 is strong .",
    "furthermore , the space @xmath40 is atomic ; indeed , the parts @xmath43 with a single element are strong atoms : @xmath524 for any part @xmath34 , and their reflections @xmath46 and @xmath47 in @xmath20 and in @xmath21 are the principal ( co)sieves , or representable presheaves : @xmath525 then the strong atoms are the objects of subposets of @xmath526 and @xmath527 isomorphic to @xmath22 and @xmath528 respectively , and are manifestly adequate for @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "note that , if @xmath22 is not partially ordered ( i.e. skeletal ) , there are non - strong atoms , namely the parts formed by pairwise isomorphic elements - objects .",
    "observe also that any two - valued bipolar space that has @xmath521 as parts , is of the form @xmath40 for a preorder on @xmath22 . indeed , the strong atoms are again the elements of @xmath22 as parts in @xmath521 , and the corresponding subposets of @xmath58 and @xmath59 as above define the desired preorder :    1 .   any open part @xmath160 is a sieve , namely that given by its interpretation ( and similarly for closed parts ) ; 2 .",
    "any sieve @xmath529 is the union of the open reflections @xmath46 of its atoms @xmath517 , and so is itself open .",
    "the open parts of @xmath40 form a topology on the underlying set of @xmath22 , namely the so - called alexandrov topology associated to the poset @xmath22 , which has closed parts as closed sets .",
    "actually , the hall - mark of such topological spaces is the reflectivity of its open sets ( or dually , the coreflectivity of the closed ones ) : every part @xmath530 has not only an  interior \" and a  closure \" but also an open reflection @xmath74 and a closed coreflection @xmath80 .",
    "let us summarize the above considerations :    the bipolar spaces @xmath40 associated to a poset on @xmath22 are coextensive with bipolar spaces with @xmath521 as parts and with alexandrov topological spaces on @xmath22 .    the definition of continuous maps between bipolar spaces , along with the appropriate extension of the above proposition will be carried out in section  [ doctrines ] .",
    "formulas  ( [ refp ] ) and  ( [ corp ] ) of section  [ two ] , which give the reflections and the coreflections of a part @xmath34 of an atomic two - valued bipolar space , then apply to alexandrov spaces , but not to general topological spaces . yet ,",
    "the first of the  ( [ refp ] ) and of the  ( [ corp ] ) still have a meaning if , as a surrogate of the open reflection @xmath46 , the neighborhood filter of a point @xmath45 is considered .",

    "this and the next sections are devoted to the situation that motivated the notion of bipolar space itself : the simultaneous inclusion of discrete fibrations and discrete opfibrations on a category in the category of categories over it .",

    "next , we turn to atoms in @xmath40 , considering first those associated to the objects of @xmath22 and then the more general ones associated to the idempotent arrows in @xmath22 , obtaining in particular the formulas for the reflection and the coreflection in open and closed parts ( that is , discrete fibrations and discrete opfibrations ) of a part of @xmath40 ( that is , a category over @xmath22 ) .",
    "@xmath536 is a category with components .",
    "indeed , the points @xmath537 of a category @xmath22 are its objects , its components @xmath538 are the components of the underlying graph , and the discrete categories are those whose only arrows are the identities .",
    "so , being cartesian closed , @xmath536 is a category with tensor , and the properties of proposition  [ closed ] hold for categories .",
    "then , by proposition  [ slice ] , every slice @xmath534 has tensor , components being given by those of the corresponding total categories .",
    "the slice over the arrow category @xmath202 is specially meaningful .",

    "note that if @xmath555 is an object over @xmath22 , multiplying it by @xmath43 in @xmath534 gives ( as total category ) the fibre category @xmath556 over @xmath43 , while multiplying it by @xmath365 gives the module @xmath557 over @xmath558 , with @xmath559 and @xmath560 .",
    "so , an object @xmath555 of @xmath534 is in particular a family of categories , the fibres @xmath556 ( @xmath45 ) , and a family of modules , the fibres @xmath557 ( @xmath558 in @xmath22 ) ; likewise , a morphism @xmath402 in @xmath534 is determined by the corresponding families of functors between the fibres @xmath561 and of module morphisms @xmath562 ( @xmath365 in @xmath22 ) , with @xmath563 and @xmath564 .    while @xmath536 is cartesian closed , it is not locally cartesian closed , that is not all its slices @xmath565 are such .",
    "if @xmath365 and @xmath566 are consecutive arrows in @xmath22 , seen as objects of @xmath534 , then their composite @xmath567 ( as a functor @xmath568 ) is also their pushout with respect to @xmath372 in @xmath534 .",
    "then , if @xmath34 is exponentiable , @xmath569 should be the pushout of @xmath570 and @xmath571 , and the latter is easily seen to be given by their composite as consecutive modules @xmath572 ( with the usual coend formula , see section  [ disfib ] ) ; thus a necessary condition for the exponentiability is that @xmath573 ( that is , the morphisms @xmath574 given by composition in @xmath34 are actually isomorphisms ) which , explicited , becomes the well - known factorization lifting property ( see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .    to verify that",
    "the condition is also sufficient , observe that , analyzing the expected @xmath421 using figures whose shapes are the @xmath43 or the @xmath558 as above , we deduce that @xmath575 and the arrows over @xmath558 in @xmath576 are the module morphisms @xmath577 , the domain and codomain being given by the corresponding @xmath578 and @xmath579 .",
    "if @xmath580 and @xmath581 are consecutive arrows of the expected @xmath421 , over @xmath558 and @xmath582 respectively , then the above condition allows a meaningful definition of composition @xmath583 by the very property of the pushout @xmath584 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath585 , the inclusion @xmath586 which preserves the initial and the terminal objects is not exponentiable in @xmath534 , since , as can be easily checked , @xmath587 does not exist , if the set @xmath102 has more than one element .",
    "recall that a category @xmath555 on @xmath22 is said to be a discrete opfibration ( abbreviated , dof ) if , given any arrow @xmath365 in @xmath22 considered as an object @xmath588 of @xmath534 , it is interpreted as a bijection by the corresponding domain arrow @xmath589 in @xmath534 .",
    "discrete fibrations ( df ) on @xmath22 are defined dually .",
    "we denote by @xmath20 and @xmath21 the full replete subcategories of @xmath534 generated by the df s and , respectively , the dof s on @xmath22 . by a well - known argumentation , these are equivalent to the presheaf categories @xmath590 $ ] and @xmath591 $ ] respectively . in a direction , one associates to a presheaf on @xmath22 its category of elements ; in the other , given a df @xmath4 over @xmath22 , every fibre @xmath592 is a discrete category which gives the value of the corresponding presheaf at @xmath43 , and for any arrow @xmath365 in @xmath22 and @xmath593 , @xmath594 ( or simply @xmath595 ) will denote the domain of the unique lifting of @xmath558 with codomain @xmath596 .",
    "when appropriate , we will not distinguish notationally a presheaf @xmath4 and the corresponding df in @xmath534 , e.g. @xmath592 will denote both the value of the presheaf @xmath4 at @xmath43 and the fibre on @xmath43 of the corresponding df .    satisfying the factorization lifting condition of section  [ catexp ] ,",
    "the df s and the dof s are exponentiable , and so are the products of a df and a dof in @xmath534 ( in fact all of them belong to the special class of ufl functors , see  @xcite ) . if @xmath4 is a df and @xmath555 is an object of @xmath534 , then , by the above description of exponentials , @xmath597 is the set of mappings @xmath598 from the set @xmath592 to the set of the objects of @xmath556 ; if furthermore @xmath27 is a dof , then the modules @xmath599 and @xmath600 ( @xmath558 in @xmath22 ) are essentially left and right mappings as in section  [ mappings ] .",
    "so , like in the case graphs over the arrow , we have    if @xmath4 is a df and @xmath27 is a dof on @xmath22 , then @xmath28 is a dof which , as a covariant presheaf , acts as follows : given a mapping @xmath601 in @xmath602 and an arrow @xmath365 in @xmath22 , @xmath603 and dually @xmath223 is a df in @xmath604 .    in particular",
    ", since any discrete object ( that is , a constant presheaf ) @xmath96 of @xmath534 is both a df and a dof ,    [ negcor ] any @xmath4 in @xmath20 has a negation functor @xmath605 , right adjoint to @xmath25 , which takes values in closed parts .",

    "note that an object in @xmath534 may not have negation , as the above example with @xmath585 shows .",
    "then , observing that the clopen parts of @xmath40 are the discrete bifibrations , which correspond to presheaves that act by bijections , corollary  [ clopencor ] applies , giving    discrete bifibrations form a cartesian closed full subcategory @xmath178 of @xmath534 , and the inclusion functor preserves exponentials . in particular , if @xmath22 is a grupoid , the open ( or closed ) parts of the corresponding boolean space @xmath40 form a cartesian closed full subcategory @xmath612 of @xmath534 , wherein exponentials are computed as in @xmath534 .",
    "thus we have a conceptual explanation of the fact that  group theory is simpler than category theory \" ( @xcite ) , in that the frobenius law hold in the grupoid doctrine ( see section  [ doctrines ] ) .",
    "now we show that @xmath534 encompasses a small portion of the bicategory @xmath613 , whose @xmath474-cells and @xmath475-cells are categories and modules between them , while the @xmath614-cells can be identified with those module morphisms of section  [ catexp ] which leave the domain and the codomain unchanged ( that is @xmath578 and @xmath579 are identity functors ) .    recall that if @xmath615 and @xmath616 are consecutive modules in @xmath613 , their composition @xmath617 is given by the coend @xmath618 while if @xmath615 , @xmath619 and @xmath620 then the biclosed structure of @xmath613 gives the modules @xmath621 and @xmath622 as the ends @xmath623 it is well - known that the structure of @xmath613 ( and in particular the fact that it is biclosed ) encodes important aspects of category theory ( such as generalized kan extensions , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "the second part follows from the fact that , having closed values , @xmath24 serves as a right adjoint of @xmath649 as well ; alternatively , observe that equation  ( [ negc ] ) coincides with the formula for @xmath650 of equation  ( [ bic ] ) , since in this case the universal quantification ( the end ) is on the terminal category .",

    "we show presently that , as in the other examples , @xmath40 is in fact an atomic space ; for the latter we presently draw the form that the expected reflections and coreflections should have ( proposition  [ main ] and corollary  [ maincor ] ) , while in section  [ reflections ] we shall prove that these formulas actually work properly .    as mentioned in the introduction , the objects @xmath553 of @xmath22 , as categories over @xmath22 , are atoms of @xmath40 ; indeed , for a part @xmath656 @xmath657 so that @xmath43  is included \" in the part @xmath34 in as many ways as are the objects of the fibre @xmath556 , while @xmath43  meets \" @xmath34 in as many ways as are its components .",

    "we will see in the next section that there may be also other atoms , but in the meantime we concentrate on those corresponding to the objects of @xmath22 .",
    "the first important fact is that they have well - known reflections , namely the representable functors : @xmath659 indeed , this is the content of the yoneda lemma , the units @xmath660 and @xmath661 of the reflections sending the only object of @xmath662 to the object @xmath663 of @xmath48 and of @xmath49 respectively .",
    "those units then induce bijections @xmath664 and so by the  ( [ atomc ] ) also bijections @xmath665 and ( addendum to the yoneda lemma ) these bijections are natural in @xmath45 .",
    "this can be rephrased by saying that @xmath4 is interpreted as itself by the yoneda functor @xmath666 ; or better , the discrete fibration @xmath4 is interpreted as the corresponding presheaf on @xmath22 .",
    "symmetrically , any discrete opfibration @xmath27 is interpreted as the corresponding presheaf on @xmath528 by @xmath667 .",
    "so , the atoms associated to the objects @xmath45 are adequate for open and closed parts , and @xmath40 is atomic . from proposition",
    "[ atomic3 ] , we get the  co - yoneda lemma \" : @xmath668 for any @xmath160 and @xmath669 , with the corresponding addendum that these bijections are natural in @xmath45 ; of course , this is a particular case of the fact that if @xmath615 and @xmath616 are consecutive modules in @xmath613 and @xmath198 is represented by a functor @xmath670 , then @xmath671 .",
    "thus , not only @xmath40 is an atomic space , but the objects - atoms @xmath45 generate full subcategories of @xmath526 and @xmath527 which are already adequate for closed and open parts , and which are isomorphic to @xmath22 and @xmath528 respectively .",
    "so proposition  [ atomic5 ] is still valid when restricted to objects - atoms , that is when the yoneda embeddings @xmath672 are used instead of @xmath312 and @xmath311 , giving    [ main ] the reflections of an object @xmath555 of @xmath534 in discrete fibrations and discrete opfibrations are given by : @xmath673 and the coreflections by @xmath674 that is , they are obtained as the cointerpretation and interpretation of @xmath34 via the yoneda embeddings .",
    "note that we are following the common  abuse \" of denoting the object @xmath555 over @xmath22 simply with @xmath34 .",
    "it is immediate to see that multiplying @xmath47 or @xmath46 with @xmath34 in @xmath534 one obtains the  comma \" or ",
    "map \" categories @xmath675 where @xmath676 has as object the pairs @xmath677 with @xmath678 and @xmath679 in @xmath22 , and as arrows @xmath680 the arrows @xmath681 in @xmath34 such that @xmath682 ; @xmath683 is defined dually .",
    "so we find again the result ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) :    [ maincor ] the reflections of an object @xmath555 of @xmath534 in discrete fibrations and discrete opfibrations are given by the components of the corresponding map categories @xmath684    alternatively , to check that discrete fibrations and discrete opfibrations are reciprocally coadequate in @xmath534 , one might prove directly the contraposition law , as we now briefly sketch .",
    "a morphism @xmath685 in @xmath20 is a natural transformation @xmath686 and , by corollary  [ negcor ] , its negation @xmath687 is the natural transformation between the corresponding negation functors @xmath688 defined by the family of mappings @xmath689 on the other hand , any natural transformation @xmath690 is expressed by a family of morphisms @xmath691 , and so ultimately by a family of mappings @xmath692 , natural in @xmath45 and @xmath97 . for any @xmath45 , by the naturality in @xmath102 and by yoneda we have a mapping @xmath693 .",

    "the result now follows from the co - yoneda lemma ( see equations  ( [ coyo ] ) of section  [ atomcat ] ) . note that we are using again the notations of the previous subsections : @xmath47 and @xmath46 are the representable functors , and the @xmath108 is taken in @xmath534 , so that if @xmath4 and @xmath2 are both df s or both dof s , then @xmath714 can be thought of as the set of natural transformations between the corresponding functors .",
    "now we turn to the typical non - object atoms which @xmath40 may have .",

    "furthermore , @xmath720 is isomorphic to the set @xmath721 of elements fixed by the mapping @xmath722 , and similarly for open parts .",
    "we begin with some remarks :    1 .   in general , an object @xmath723 over @xmath43 of ( the total category of ) a part @xmath656 corresponds to a morphism @xmath724 in @xmath534 and so we can define @xmath725:=\\comp a : \\comp x \\to \\comp p$ ] ; since @xmath726 we so obtain an element @xmath725 $ ] of @xmath370 :  the component of @xmath723 \" . in the other direction ,",
    "any component @xmath727 is the component of ( at least ) one object .",
    "moreover , if @xmath728 in @xmath534 , then @xmath729\\mapsto [ \\alpha a]$ ] .",
    "so , denoting by @xmath730 the total functor , we have a natural transformation @xmath731:\\point^\\cat\\circ\\tot\\to\\comp:\\cat / x\\to\\set\\ ] ] whose components are onto mappings .",
    "since any arrow @xmath732 in @xmath534 corresponds to an object @xmath733 over @xmath43 and a loop at @xmath723 over @xmath52 , @xmath734 is the set of fixed points of the mapping @xmath722 . on the other hand",

    "two elements belong to the same component of an endomapping if they are sent to the same element by suitable iterations of it ; for an idempotent mapping , it is enough to check if they are sent to the same element by the mapping itself : @xmath738 = [ b ] \\iff ea = eb\\ ] ]    denoting with @xmath43 also the unique object of @xmath739 , which is isomorphic to @xmath717 in @xmath534 , let us check the right universality of @xmath740 $ ] ( i.e. for closed parts ; left universality follows by symmetry ) : @xmath741 is the mapping @xmath742\\ ] ] which takes each object - element @xmath733 fixed by @xmath737 , to its component in @xmath743 , and it is indeed a bijection , since the mapping @xmath744\\mapsto ( de)a\\ ] ] which takes a component in @xmath743 to the fixed point @xmath745 , where @xmath723 is any of its objects - elements , is well defined ( by the above remark ) and is readily verified to be its inverse . as a consequence , @xmath746 is an atomic pair ( see proposition  [ atomic1 ] ) .",
    "it is worth to see what @xmath54 and @xmath53 are concretely .",
    "observe first that , by applying corollary  [ maincor ] to any part @xmath747 in @xmath534 , we have the formula @xmath748 in which the ( total ) category @xmath749 is a df , when considered as a category over @xmath34 rather than over @xmath22 ; indeed , as a presheaf on @xmath34 it is given by @xmath750 , so that @xmath751 may be seen as the components of this presheaf ( that is , its colimit ) . in the case of @xmath717 , associated to the idempotent @xmath361 in @xmath22 , we then have that @xmath752 is given by the components of the corresponding presheaf on @xmath715 , that is of the idempotent endomapping @xmath753 obtained by multiplying by @xmath52 ; but then , as just observed in proposition  [ idat ] , the components correspond to fixed points and we have proved the first part of the following    [ k ] the right reflection @xmath54 of the idempotent atom associated to @xmath361 is the covariant presheaf defined as follows : @xmath754 is the set of the arrows @xmath365 in @xmath22 such that @xmath366 , and if @xmath566 then @xmath755 . furthermore @xmath54 is a retract of @xmath47 .",
    "dual statements hold for @xmath53 .    as for the second part ,",
    "one readily checks that @xmath756 is a retraction of the inclusion @xmath757 .",
    "then @xmath54 is a retract in @xmath591 $ ] , and the associated idempotent @xmath758 corresponds to @xmath52 via the yoneda embedding .",
    "note that if the idempotent @xmath361 splits already in @xmath22 as @xmath759 , with @xmath760 , then @xmath54 is isomorphic to the representable @xmath761 , since the natural transformations @xmath762 and @xmath763 are each other s inverse .",
    "so the reflections of the atoms associated to split idempotents are in fact already reflections of objects - atoms .",
    "let us call an arrow @xmath361 in @xmath22  eventually idempotent \" if there is a natural number @xmath764 such such that @xmath765 for any @xmath766 . as for idempotent arrows ,",
    "any eventually idempotent arrow in @xmath22 can be seen as a category over @xmath22 , and argumentations similar to those of proposition  [ idat ] easily show that it is an atom of @xmath40 .",
    "thus @xmath40 may have several kinds of atoms , but we now show that all of them originate the same kind of atomic pair :    [ idatomic ] if @xmath767 is an atomic pair of @xmath40 , then @xmath53 and @xmath54 are retracts of representable functors @xmath46 and @xmath47 for an object @xmath45 ; furthermore , @xmath767 can be obtained as the reflection of the atom @xmath717 corresponding to an idempotent arrow @xmath361 in @xmath22 .    so the choice of considering , in the definition of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , not all atomic pairs but only those which are reflections of actual atoms of @xmath22 was not restrictive , at least in this case .",
    "note first that , by the above remarks , given @xmath768\\in\\ten(p , q)$ ] , @xmath769 and @xmath770 , we have @xmath771 = [ \\langle\\alpha l,\\beta r\\rangle]\\in\\ten(p',q')$ ] .",
    "now , let @xmath772 be biuniversal , and take an element @xmath773 in this component : @xmath774 = u$ ] .",
    "suppose furthermore that @xmath775 is over @xmath45 ( that is , @xmath776 and @xmath777 ) ; by the ( right ) universality of @xmath231 , there is a ( unique ) @xmath778 such that @xmath779\\in\\ten(\\down e,\\up x)$ ] ; by yoneda , there is a ( unique ) @xmath780 such that @xmath781 .",

    "of course , one proves symmetrically that @xmath53 is a retract of the representable @xmath46 .",
    "for the second part , observe that @xmath785 corresponds by yoneda to an idempotent @xmath786 in @xmath22 , whose reflection @xmath787 is isomorphic to @xmath54 , since both of them are retracts of @xmath47 associated to the same idempotent in @xmath591 $ ] ( see proposition  [ k ] above ) . since an atomic pair is also a dedekind cut ( see proposition  [ ded ] ) , any of its components determines the other one ( up to isomorphisms ) .",
    "so @xmath788 implies @xmath789 and the proof is complete .",
    "since a possible construction of the cauchy completion of a category @xmath22 is given by the full subcategory of @xmath590 $ ] generated by the retracts of representable functors , and since cauchy completion is defined up to equivalence ( see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite ) , we have the following    [ cauchy ] in the space @xmath40 , associated to the category @xmath22 , @xmath526 and @xmath527 are the cauchy completions of @xmath22 and @xmath528 respectively .",
    "now we can return to one of the examples of section  [ eval ] : what is the evaluation of a closed part at an idempotent atom ?",
    "recall that , as seen in proposition  [ idat ] , given a dof @xmath27 on @xmath22 , the evaluation of @xmath27 at @xmath52 @xmath790 is the subset @xmath721 of elements fixed by the mapping @xmath722 , and similarly for open parts .",
    "then , we have the following generalizations of the yoneda and co - yoneda lemma ( see propositions  [ atomic3 ] and equation  [ coyo ] ) : @xmath791 which can be rephrased , for closed parts , as follows :    * given an idempotent @xmath361 in @xmath22 and a functor @xmath704 , the natural transformations @xmath792 are in bijective correspondence with the elements of @xmath356 fixed by @xmath52 ; * given an idempotent @xmath361 in @xmath22 and a functor @xmath704 , the tensor product of functors @xmath793 is given by the elements of @xmath356 fixed by @xmath52 .    both of them can be easily proved directly : in the former case , @xmath794 corresponds to @xmath795 , with inverse given by @xmath796 ; in the latter @xmath797\\in \\down e\\,\\otimes d$ ] corresponds to @xmath798 , with inverse @xmath799 $ ] .",
    "in particular , given two atoms @xmath800 associated to idempotent arrows @xmath361 and @xmath801 , we have that @xmath802 , is the set of arrows @xmath803 fixed by @xmath52 ; but by proposition  [ k ] , @xmath804 is in @xmath805 if it is fixed by @xmath806 , so that @xmath807 is the set of arrows @xmath804 such that @xmath808 .",
    "thus we find the well - known description of the cauchy completion of a category @xmath22 as its  karoubi envelope \" ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which can be seen as the full subcategory of @xmath58 generated by the idempotent atoms , and that ( by propositions  [ idatomic ] ) is equivalent to @xmath58 itself .",
    "furthermore , the interpretation of a df @xmath4 as a presheaf on @xmath58 ( or on the karoubi envelope of @xmath22 ) gives the ( unique , up to isomorphisms ) extension of the corresponding presheaf @xmath700 , whose value at any idempotent atom @xmath52 , associated to @xmath361 , is the corresponding fixed set @xmath809 ( and similarly for the dof s ) .",
    "finally , observe that the atomic pairs of @xmath40 coincide with the adjoint pairs of modules @xmath810 in the original definition of the cauchy completion of @xmath22 ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) :    [ adjuni ] the modules @xmath811 and @xmath812 are adjoint iff there is a biuniversal element in @xmath813 for the bifunctor @xmath814 .",

    "the bijection is natural .    1 .   first",
    ", the mappings @xmath844 have indeed values in @xmath80 , because the conditions of proposition  [ phi2 ] on @xmath580 imply in a straightforward manner the corresponding ones on @xmath901 required in proposition  [ alpha2 ] .",
    "furthermore , the naturality condition is fulfilled too , because for any @xmath828 , @xmath883 and @xmath884 in @xmath22 @xmath902 @xmath903 2 .   in the other direction , to show that @xmath897 defines a morphism @xmath894 over @xmath22 , we must check that the conditions of proposition  [ phi2 ] hold : 1 .   for any @xmath733 and @xmath365 , @xmath904 . that the domain of @xmath905 is indeed @xmath906 is immediate ; as for the codomain , by the naturality of @xmath327 @xmath907 and the latter is the codomain of @xmath908 , by the corresponding property of @xmath909 in proposition  [ alpha2 ] .",

    "again , it is straightforward to check that the bijection is indeed natural , and so the proposition is proved .",
    "if we consider only the object mappings of the morphisms @xmath580 and @xmath916 in the present section , the  duality \" of the proofs of the reflections and of the coreflections in discrete opfibrations is more evident , as summarized below .    * naturality conditions for @xmath327 : if @xmath828 @xmath917 * definition of @xmath918 and @xmath897 : @xmath919 * proof of the naturality of the @xmath918 : if @xmath828 @xmath920",
    "in this section we define the category @xmath88 of bipolar spaces and continuous maps and consider various  space functors \" valued in it , notably the ( pseudo)functors @xmath921 and @xmath922 ; in the other direction , we define a  base functor \" @xmath923 , by showing that atoms are preserved by ( the left adjoint component of ) a continuous map .",
    "then , connections with the kan extensions of set functors are analyzed .",
    "the definition of continuous map is modelled on the effect that a functor @xmath924 has on the corresponding spaces @xmath40 and @xmath925 .",
    "recall that any such a functor gives rise to a pair of adjoint functors @xmath926 where @xmath927 is induced by composition with @xmath558 , while @xmath928 is given by the pullback in @xmath536 .",
    "the pair @xmath929 satisfies the frobenius law , that is the ( natural ) morphism @xmath930 is an isomorphism for any parts @xmath656 and @xmath931 , @xmath932 being the counit of the adjunction .",
    "this follows essentially from the fact that the composition of two pullback squares , expressed by @xmath933 , gives another  outer \" pullback square , expressed by @xmath934 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath656 and @xmath935 have the same total category ,",
    "so that the functor @xmath936 factorizes through @xmath937 and @xmath938 up to the isomorphism @xmath939 which takes the component @xmath725_x$ ] of an object @xmath678 to the component of the same object @xmath725_y$ ] in @xmath940 ; so , also @xmath941 factorizes through @xmath942 and @xmath928 , up to isomorphisms .",
    "finally , @xmath928 preserves open and closed parts : if @xmath943 is a df or a dof , so is @xmath944 .",
    "so , if @xmath22 and @xmath945 are bipolar spaces , we define a * continuous map * @xmath924 as a pair of adjoint functors @xmath946 which satisfies the frobenius law , with @xmath928 preserving open and closed parts and with an isomorphism @xmath947    if @xmath924 and @xmath948 are continuous maps , then @xmath949 is defined by composition of adjoint functors : @xmath950 and it is again continuous ; indeed , it satisfies the frobenius law because , for any @xmath71 and @xmath951 , the frobenius map @xmath952 factorizes through the isomorphisms @xmath953 and @xmath954 : @xmath955 furthermore , @xmath956 is given by the composition @xmath957 and @xmath958 clearly preserves open and closed parts .",
    "thus we have the category @xmath88 , with bipolar spaces as objects and continuous maps as arrows .    by the remarks at the beginning of this section ,",
    "there is a  space functor \" , actually , a pseudofunctor @xmath959 and likewise , in the two - valued context , there is a space functor @xmath960 which takes a poset @xmath22 to its alexandrov space , and a morphism @xmath924 of posets to the corresponding continuous map of topological spaces @xmath961 .",
    "we now define space ( pseudo)functors @xmath962 where @xmath94 is the category of reflexive graphs , beginning with the object mapping of the former .",
    "so we present the bipolar space @xmath963 associated to a graph @xmath22 , straightforwardly generalizing the considerations of section  [ graphs ] .    1",
    ".   the category @xmath964 has tensor : if @xmath555 is a graph over @xmath22 , its points are the sections @xmath965 of @xmath820 , while its components are those of the total graph @xmath34 ( see proposition  [ slice ] ) .",
    "the full subcategory @xmath966 of @xmath964 , generated by the nodes @xmath967 and the arrows @xmath968 of @xmath22 , is adequate for @xmath964 .",
    "in fact , @xmath969 $ ] .",
    "( in general , if @xmath970 $ ] is a presheaf category , one may consider an object @xmath971 as a df on @xmath0 , and so an object @xmath972 , being a df on @xmath0 over the df @xmath22 , is itself a df over the total category of @xmath22 .",
    "but the latter is the category of elements @xmath973 of the presheaf @xmath974 ; then the objects of @xmath975 correspond to the df s on @xmath973 , that is @xmath976 $ ] ( see also  @xcite ) . in the present case",
    ", @xmath966 is @xmath973 , when the graph @xmath22 is considered as a presheaf on the category @xmath417 of section  [ endomappings ] . )",
    "multiplying @xmath555 by @xmath43 in @xmath964 gives ( as total graph ) the fibre @xmath556 over @xmath43 , that is the set of nodes over @xmath43 ; on the other hand , multiplying it by @xmath365 gives a graph @xmath557 over the arrow @xmath375 , with @xmath977 and @xmath978 ( see section  [ mappings ] ) .",
    "so , an object @xmath555 of @xmath964 is in particular a family of sets , the fibres @xmath556 ( @xmath45 ) , and a family of objects of @xmath387 , the fibres @xmath557 ( @xmath558 in @xmath22 ) ; and a morphism @xmath402 in @xmath964 is determined by the corresponding families of mappings between the fibres @xmath979 and of morphisms in @xmath387 , @xmath980 ( @xmath365 in @xmath22 ) , with @xmath981 and @xmath982 ( see also section  [ catexp ] ) .",
    "a part @xmath983 is closed or * right functional * if it is orthogonal to any  domain arrow \" @xmath589 in @xmath966 , that is if it is interpreted as a bijection by any domain arrow ; similarly , @xmath34 is open or * left functional * if it is interpreted as a bijection by any codomain arrow .",
    "so @xmath34 is right ( respectively left ) functional iff all the @xmath557 above defined are right ( respectively left ) mappings as graph over @xmath375 ; then in this case @xmath34  is \" a diagram ( that is , a graph morphism ) @xmath984 ( respectively @xmath985 ) , or equivalently a functor @xmath986 ( respectively @xmath987 ) from the free category generated by @xmath22 .",
    "so , the full subcategories @xmath20 and @xmath21 of open and closed parts may be seen as induced by the functors @xmath988 which reduce any domain or , respectively , codomain arrow in @xmath966 to an identity . in particular , they are reflective and coreflective in @xmath964 .",
    "4 .   as in the case of categories ( see section  [ categories ] ) , the exponentials @xmath421 in @xmath964 can be computed as follows : @xmath989 and the arrows over @xmath558 in @xmath421 are the morphisms @xmath990 in @xmath387 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath991 and @xmath992 , the @xmath557 are left mappings and the @xmath993 are right mappings as in section  [ mappings ] , and so @xmath421 is itself right functional ( and dually @xmath435 is left functional ) .",
    "the atoms of @xmath40 are the nodes @xmath994 , and these are actually strong atoms .",
    "the reflection @xmath47 of the atom @xmath43 is given by @xmath995 , while if @xmath883 is an arrow in @xmath22 then @xmath996 is given , as a right mapping , by @xmath997 .",
    "so , the categories @xmath526 and @xmath527 are ( equivalent to ) the free categories on @xmath22 and on @xmath528 , and the associated interpretations take a left ( respectively right ) functional graph over @xmath22 to the corresponding presheaf on @xmath998 ( respectively , on @xmath999 ) .",
    "thus @xmath40 is atomic , and we have the usual formulas for coreflections and reflections of a graph over @xmath22 in functional graphs , given by its interpretations and cointerpretations as a presheaf on the corresponding free category .    similarly , one defines the spaces @xmath1000 associated to a reflexive graph @xmath1001 .",
    "note that now the atoms are the _ points _ of @xmath22 , and that they are not strong . at first sight",
    "reflexive graphs appear to be unsuitable for being analyzed by cofigures .",
    "indeed , the very property that allows the construction of the homotopy category of any @xmath94-valued category ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) , namely the fact that @xmath1002 preserves products , implies that the only information obtainable on a reflexive graph , by tensoring it with other graphs , is the number of its components ; this is in some sense analogous to the fact that the only information obtainable on an event , by knowing the probabilities of its conjunctions with other _ independent _ events , is its probability .",
    "in fact , as for categories , in the space @xmath1003 the reciprocally coadequate subcategories @xmath1004 and @xmath1005 of open and closed parts , reduce both to the subcategory of discrete - constant graphs ( so that @xmath1006 is in fact a codiscrete boolean space , as defined in section  [ boole ] ; the same is true for any codiscrete _ category _ ) .",
    "however , in general the spaces @xmath1000 are as rich in content as those associated to irreflexive graphs : just consider the free reflexive graph on a given graph in @xmath14 .",
    "now we can turn to the definition of the space ( pseudo)functor on graph morphisms @xmath924 . as in the case of categories ,",
    "such a morphism gives rise to a pair of adjoint functors @xmath926 where @xmath927 is induced by composition , while @xmath928 is given by the pullback in @xmath14 .",
    "the pair @xmath929 satisfies again the frobenius law , and the functor @xmath1007 factorizes through @xmath1008 and @xmath1009 up to isomorphisms : @xmath939 finally , @xmath928 preserves open and closed parts : if @xmath1010 is right or left functional , so is @xmath1011 .",
    "analogous considerations hold for reflexive graphs .    of course",
    ", also these space functors have a two - valued version : @xmath1012 where @xmath1013 and @xmath1014 are the categories of sets with an endorelation , or with a reflexive endorelation respectively .",
    "we now define a  base \" functor @xmath923 whose object mapping takes a space @xmath22 to the category @xmath58 defined in section  [ atomic ] ; of course , one could consider @xmath59 instead , and in fact a balanced choice would be to take the pair @xmath1015 . recall that @xmath58 has the atoms in @xmath276 as objects , while @xmath1016 . then for any continuous map @xmath1017 we want to define a functor @xmath1018 and in particular its object mapping @xmath1019 to do this , we first prove that the left adjoint @xmath1020 takes atoms to atoms , so that we can define @xmath1021 , and then we extend it to a functor @xmath1022 as desired , thanks to the fact that @xmath928 preserves open parts . but before going into the details , we present the following result to illustrate the idea behind proposition  [ bas ] :    [ coadj2 ] the left and right adjoint components of a continuous map are coadjoint functors , that is there are bijections @xmath1023 natural in @xmath71 and @xmath1024 .",
    "we have @xmath1025 where the first bijection is given by @xmath1026 and the second by the frobenius law , both of them natural . then if @xmath264 is an atom , so is also @xmath1027 , _ roughly _ because , for any @xmath1028 ( and similarly for open parts ) , @xmath1029 where the first bijection is given by the above coadjunction , the second by the fact that @xmath1030 and @xmath43 is an atom , and the third by the adjunction @xmath929 .",
    "but in fact we need to be more precise , exhibiting an actual biuniversal element @xmath1031 associated to the biuniversal element @xmath1032 , as required in the definition of atom",
    ". the right definition of @xmath1033 is the most natural one : @xmath1034 observe that @xmath1033 is indeed in @xmath1035 , because @xmath1036 and since @xmath1037 , @xmath1038 to prove the biuniversality of @xmath1033 we must show that @xmath1039 is a bijection @xmath1040 for any closed part @xmath27 , and similarly for open parts .",
    "but @xmath1041 and so we have to show that @xmath1042 is a bijection .",
    "we need the following    the following equality of morphisms @xmath1043 in @xmath1044 holds : @xmath1045 where @xmath1046 is the frobenius map  ( [ frob ] ) and @xmath117 is the unit of the adjunction @xmath929 .",
    "composing out both morphisms with the projections @xmath1047 and @xmath1048 we get the same result : in the first case we clearly obtain @xmath1049 and @xmath1050 respectively ; on the other hand , denoting by @xmath1051 and @xmath1052 the projections in the definition  ( [ frob ] ) of @xmath1053 , we have @xmath1054 @xmath1055 where , in the last two passages , the naturality of the counit @xmath932 and the triangular identities have been used .",
    "we are now in a position to prove    [ bas ] if @xmath43 is a ( strong ) atom of @xmath22 , with biuniversal element @xmath1032 , and if @xmath924 is a continuous map , then @xmath1056 is a ( strong ) atom of @xmath945 , with biuniversal element @xmath1031 , as defined in equation  ( [ fu ] ) above .    to check",

    "then argumentations similar to those of section  [ atomic ] show that @xmath1150 is self - dual via an isomorphism @xmath1153 with the identity as object mapping ( so that in the two - valued case @xmath1150 is an equivalence relation ) , and that the interpretation and cointerpretation of a clopen part of @xmath22 via @xmath1154 are the same , modulo this duality . if @xmath22 is atomic , @xmath1150 is adequate and coadequate for clopen parts , and we have the formulas for reflection and coreflection of a part @xmath71 in clopen parts ( see corollary  [ atomic5 ] of section  [ atomic ] ) : @xmath1155 for the bipolar space @xmath40 , @xmath1106 , we have that @xmath1156 is equivalent to the grupoid reflection of @xmath526 or @xmath527 ; restricting to the objects - atoms , we get the grupoid reflection @xmath1157 of @xmath22 or @xmath528 , and the above formulas give the reflection and coreflection of a category over @xmath22 in discrete bifibrations ( that is , in presheaves which act by bijections ) as presheaves on @xmath1157 .      in our examples of bipolar spaces ,",
    "open and closed parts were defined by orthogonality with respect to special morphisms in @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , in each @xmath19 we could find special ( subterminal ) objects , the  nodes \" and the  arrows \" , such that any  arrow \" @xmath558 has  domain \" and  codomain \" morphisms @xmath589 and @xmath1158 for uniquely determined  nodes \" @xmath43 and @xmath372 ; closed and open parts were then defined by orthogonality with respect to these domain and codomain morphisms . in particular , in section  [ mappings ]",
    "we defined right and left mappings of by orthogonality with respect to @xmath1159 and @xmath1160 in @xmath387 ; e.g. @xmath396 is a right mapping iff it is interpreted as a bijection by the arrow @xmath411 . since a recurrent topic of the present paper is to work with cofigures too , one is led to wonder what is obtained with the corresponding  co - orthogonality condition \" , namely that @xmath34 is cointerpreted as a bijection by the arrow @xmath1160 .",
    "the answer is : a ( right ) mapping with possibly repeated arrows ; we call such an object of @xmath387 a ( right )  comapping \" .",
    "comappings do have the hall - mark of functionality : to any element @xmath43 in @xmath398 there corresponds one and only one element @xmath556 of the codomain @xmath399 .",
    "the two interpretations of section  [ mappings ] still hold , but the first one now sounds  follow _ any _ of the arrows starting from @xmath43 \" . on the other hand , comappings",
    "lack the unicity of mappings , since two of them may have the same  functional role \" ; in particular , left and right comappings can not be reciprocally coadequate .",
    "the space functors @xmath921 ( or , in a two - valued context , @xmath1161 ) , @xmath922 and @xmath1162 of sections  [ continuous ] and  [ space ] are all instances of  bipolar doctrines \" , i.e. pseudofunctors @xmath1163 for categories @xmath1164 with suitable properties ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "of course , these doctrines constitute a context which makes it possible generalizations of categorical concepts such as kan extensions or cauchy completions .",
    "abstracting further , one can define temporal doctrines wherein , for each type @xmath1165 , the category of attributes or parts @xmath19 has four temporal operator , i.e. the endofunctors @xmath1166 which fulfil the adjunction laws @xmath1167 and @xmath1168 and the coadjunction law ( see equations  ( [ f1 ] ) and  ( [ f2 ] ) in the introduction ) .    anyway , a general principle which seems to emerge from the present work is the following : while in a two - valued context open and closed parts ( generally speaking ) are often disciplined by a strict duality ( due to the self - duality of @xmath201 itself ) , and so one can dispense with the explicit consideration of both of them , this is not the case in a set - valued context : the open and closed parts need to be dealt with simultaneously , their interaction being given not only by the fact that they belong to the same category , but , most importantly , by the tensor functor . a point that may deserve to be deepened is whether a significant theory can be achieved by considering only open and closed parts , apart from their inclusion in an ampler category of parts , along with a bifunctor @xmath279 satisfying suitable properties ( such as a the existence of negation functors and reciprocal coadequacy ) .",
    "we hope to have shown that the conceptual frame of bipolar spaces offers a new perspective on important aspects of category theory , such as the cauchy completion of a category , the tensor product ( coend ) of functors , the kan extensions of set functors and on the concept of mapping itself ; then it seems likely that a  logic with components \" , wherein the tensor functor and the resulting notion of cofigure play a major role , could be considered as a useful extension or deepening of  generalized logic \" ( @xcite ) .",
    "whether bipolar spaces have other theoretical aspects that deserve to be developed , or encompass more relevant examples than those presented here ( perhaps , valued in ",
    "truth values \" categories @xmath349 other than @xmath111 or @xmath201 ) , is open to further investigations .",
