    "the investigation of lanthanide / actinide based heavy fermion(hf ) systems has been a central theme in condensed matter physics both theoretically and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "their behaviour is quite distinct from conventional clean metals , the basic physics being driven by strong spin - flip scattering from essentially localized f - levels , generating the large effective mass .",
    "the periodic anderson model(pam ) forms the general paradigm within which these materials are studied .",
    "the minimal model consists of a regular array of sites , each associated with a localized , non - degenerate f - electron core orbital , coupled to a delocalized conduction electron orbital via a local hybridization .",
    "neighboring conduction electron orbitals are connected via a hopping matrix element and electron interactions enter the model via an on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft )  @xcite has proved to be a very powerful framework for studies of various lattice models such as the hubbard model or the pam . within dmft , which is exact in the limit of infinite dimensions ,",
    "the self - energy becomes spatially local or momentum independent . as a consequence ,",
    "lattice models map onto an effective single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) with a self consistently determined host  @xcite .",
    "the pam in the absence of a magnetic field has been studied extensively within the framework of dmft .",
    "some of the numerical or semi - analytical methods ( impurity solvers ) that exist for solving the the effective siam that arises within dmft are quantum monte carlo  @xcite , numerical renormalization group  @xcite , iterated perturbation theory  @xcite , noncrossing approximation  @xcite , the local moment approach  @xcite , the large - n / slave - boson  @xcite , exact diagonalization  @xcite self - consistent perturbation theory  @xcite , the gutzwiller variational method  @xcite and the average t - matrix apprximation  @xcite .",
    "every method has its own advantage , however most of them suffer from one or the other limitations .",
    "for example , the qmc suffers from minus sign problem at low temperature or large interactions , while ipt is able to capture only an algebraic decay of the kondo scale with increasing interactions .",
    "ed and nrg are in principle exact , as is qmc , but since the spectral functions are obtained as a set of discrete poles , a broadening is required , which is non - uniquely specified .    in this context , the ( lma)@xcite , a diagrammatic theory based non - perturbative many body method , has emerged as an approach for the single impurity model and even for the lattice models within dmft , that overcomes some of the limitations mentioned above . in particular",
    ", one obtains the exact dependence on interactions and hybridization of the kondo scale of the siam in strong coupling as the bethe ansatz solution for the kondo model  @xcite .",
    "very good agreement has been seen between lma and nrg results for the spectral functions of the siam  @xcite . within dmft",
    ", the lma has proved quite successful in describing the spectral and transport properties of several metallic and insulating heavy fermion systems such as ceb@xmath4 , smb@xmath4 , ybal@xmath5 , ceal@xmath5 , ybb@xmath6 , ceos@xmath7sb@xmath6 in the paramagnetic phase  @xcite .",
    "the lma is computationally inexpensive , yields quantities in real frequency directly , and is semi - analytical .",
    "one limitation of lma is that it is based on a symmetry restoration ansatz , that is not easily generalizable to other problems , such as the multi - orbital or multi - channel cases .",
    "recently , a generalization of lma has been reported for the multi - orbital anderson and hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "further , it was shown that the lma is a conserving approximation .",
    "the other limitation is that since lma is an approximate theory , one has to benchmark its results against more exact theories such as nrg and qmc to ascertain its reliability .",
    "nevertheless , given the several advantages above , and benchmarks , the lma within dmft is an appropriate choice to study the effects of magnetic fields in heavy fermions .",
    "several theoretical studies of the effects of magnetic field on heavy fermion systems using either the kondo lattice model ( klm ) or the pam have been reported .",
    "the magnetic field induced insulator - metal transition in kondo insulators has been studied by various groups  @xcite .",
    "as relevant to heavy fermion metals , the metamagnetic transition has been studied using large - n mean - field  @xcite and subsequently using dmft+qmc  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "our objective is to understand the magnetotransport in heavy fermion metals .",
    "previous work in this direction has been carried out mainly either using the single - site anderson models  @xcite , thus missing out the lattice coherence effects completely or using large - n mean field treatment of the anderson lattice hamiltonian  @xcite . in order to capture the lattice coherence effects along with the single - impurity incoherent regime quantitatively within a single framework",
    ", we employ the finite - field lma  @xcite within dmft for the periodic anderson model away from half - filling and determine the effect of magnetic field on spectra and transport of heavy fermion metals .",
    "our focus has been on the strong coupling regime , and the quantities that we have studied are spectral functions and magnetoresistance .",

    "( ii )  the spin dependent conduction and f - electron spectra @xmath102 and @xmath103 should adiabatically connect to the non - interacting limit at low energy scales _",
    "if we take the @xmath9-electron and @xmath11-electron fields as zero and @xmath85 respectively , substitute for @xmath50 the renormalized f - level ( @xmath104 ) and compute the spectra in the non - interacting limit ; then the interacting spectra and the non - interacting spectra should be same at low energy scales .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : adia ] , where the spin dependent scaling spectra @xmath105 for the interacting case ( @xmath106 ) is superposed onto the non - interacting spectra .",
    "we see from figure  [ fig : adia ] that both the curves are almost identical near the fermi level .",
    "this demonstrates adiabatic continuity of the strong coupling regime to the non interacting limit which represents fermi liquid behaviour in presence of magnetic field for the asymmetric case ( in parallel to the symmetric pam  @xcite ) .    to see the effect of magnetic field on the spin dependent effective fields @xmath85 and the spin dependent quasiparticle weights @xmath107",

    "indeed , we see that the spin summed spectra also exhibit universal scaling and adiabatic continuity at low energy scales .",
    "we wish to reiterate the dicussion in the beginning of this section that that the universality and scaling demonstrated above holds for a fixed conduction band filling @xmath61 , a fixed @xmath11-level asymmetry and for a specific bare conduction band density of states . in other words ,",
    "the functional forms of the spectra shown above would change for a different choice for @xmath61 or @xmath67 or @xmath116 .",
    "now we turn to the lma results for the field evolution of the asymmetric pam for a fixed temperature . in figure",
    "[ fig : graph1 ] , we show @xmath62 spin summed conduction and @xmath11-electron scaling spectra for various fields : @xmath117 ( solid ) , 0.5 ( dotted ) , 1.0 ( dashed ) , 1.5 ( dot - dashed ) , 2.0 ( bold solid ) , 3.0 ( bold dotted ) , 5.0 ( bold dashed ) and 10.0 ( bold dot - dashed ) and fixed interaction strength @xmath106 . in our earlier work on the symmetric pam  @xcite , we have shown that there is a gap at the fermi level , as there must be for a kondo insulator .",
    "but in the asymmetric limit @xmath118 ( see figure  [ fig : graph1 ] ) , the gap moves away from the fermi level and becomes a pseudo - gap .",
    "the width of the kondo resonance at the fermi level is proportional to the low - energy scale @xmath119 .",
    "the insets of figure  [ fig : graph1 ] show the spectra on a large frequency scale .",
    "it is seen that for very large frequencies the tails of the spectra for all fields are identical which is physically natural since one can expect that the effect of the field should dominate only for @xmath120 . now with increasing magnetic field , the lattice kondo resonance splits into two peaks , with the distance between the peaks also increasing .",
    "qualitatively we can understand the results as follows : in the non - interacting limit for the symmetric case , we have shown that the @xmath9 and @xmath11 -levels shift rigidly due to the zeeman effect .",
    "the same concept is valid for the asymmetric case also for the non - interacting limit _",
    "i.e. _ the spectral function for the up and down spin bands shift rigidly away from the fermi level . in the presence of interactions , in parallel to the symmetric case",
    ", the shift of the spin bands should not be rigid due to the competition between zeeman splitting and kondo screening . and",
    "indeed , we find that although the distance between the two peaks varies linearly with field in strong coupling ( see figure  [ fig : shiftdn ] ) , the slope is not equal to 2 as would have been if the shift had been rigid ( or purely due to zeeman effect ) .",
    "in fact , the slope should be equal to 4 as the following argument shows . from equations  ,  ,   and  , it is straightforward to see that the splitting of the kondo resonance , @xmath121 is given by s_kr=_z_(h)[skr ] the strong - coupling asymptotic behaviour of the above quantity may be inferred using the expressions derived in  @xcite for the flat - band siam .",
    "^r_(0,h ) - ^r_(0,0 ) = - [ sc1 ] = 1 + [ sc2 ] where @xmath122 is the flat - band hybridization .",
    "although these were derived for the siam , we are justified in using the same expressions for the pam for the following reason : since the transverse spin - polarization propagator is constructed using the uhf propagators which do not contain the low energy scale , and hence are flat for @xmath123 , the strong coupling ( sc ) asymptotics derived for the siam would be similar to that for the pam",
    ". the only difference would be in the value of @xmath124 since the uhf propagators for the pam have a different structure than that of the siam .",
    "using equations   and   in  , and expanding the logarithm appearing in equation   to linear order in @xmath125 , we get s_kr 4h [ eq : skrf ] as argued in  @xcite , the above result is synonymous to the wilson s ratio being equal to 2 in sc .",
    "the inset of figure  [ fig : shiftdn ] shows the ratio @xmath126 as a function of interaction strength .",
    "it is seen that even for @xmath127 , the ratio is @xmath128 , which implies a non - rigid shift of the spin - bands .",
    "further , with increasing interaction strength , the ratio increases monotonically .",
    "although it must asymptotically approach 4 , to be consistent with the result ( equation  ) obtained above , we are unable to access the large @xmath13 region ( for @xmath129 ) due to the prohibitive computational expense in handling exponentially small low energy scales .    in a recent dmft study using qmc as the impurity solver , the kondo lattice model was studied  @xcite .",
    "real frequency spectra were obtained with a stochastic analytic continuation method .",
    "the parameters chosen were @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the main result was that the bands were found to shift rigidly , in contrast to what we find above .",
    "the difference with our findings could be due to various reasons , of which the most important seems to be that their low energy scale is @xmath132 , while our scales are @xmath133 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "this is significant because only when the kondo scale is exponentially small is the coupling between the impurity and the conduction spin renormalized strongly , and thus the kondo screening would be strong .",
    "if this kondo screening is weak , as could probably be in the study mentioned above , then the zeeman effect would win easily , and the bands would shift rigidly .",
    "now , we turn our attention to field - dependent transport properties . at finite temperature ,",
    "as the spin summed conduction electron spectra exhibits universal scaling in terms of @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) in the strong coupling regime for low fields , we expect that the resistivity will also exhibit scaling in terms of @xmath134 .",
    "the classic hf metallic resistivity increases with temperatures ( initially as @xmath136 ) , goes through a maximum @xmath137 ( the peak position of @xmath138 ) and then decreases with temperature characteristic of single impurity behaviour .",
    "we observe the same form for the resistivity in our calculations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : graph3 ] ( top ) , the resistivity _ vs _ scaled temperature @xmath139 is shown for both @xmath140 and for a range of fields : @xmath141 ( solid ) , 0.06 ( dotted ) , 0.5 ( dashed ) , 0.5 ( long - dashed ) and 2.0 ( dot - dashed ) with @xmath73 equal to 6.6 .",
    "the two most significant features of the above result are ",
    "( i ) negative magnetoresistance is observed over the entire range of temperatures as shown in figure  [ fig : graph3 ] ( bottom ) .",
    "( ii ) the maximum in resistivity at the coherence peak reduces in magnitude and moves to higher temperatures with increasing field . in previous work",
    ", magnetoresistance was found to be positive for the siam  @xcite through fermi liquid theory arguments and for the anderson lattice  @xcite through the average t - matrix approximation ( ata ) .",
    "the fundamental difference between the siam and the pam is the presence of lattice coherence in the latter which manifests itself at low temperatures . at @xmath2 ,",
    "it is clear that magnetic field suppresses spin - flip scattering ( sfs ) since the main effect of a field would be to polarize the system .",
    "however , at low temperatures , the physics is different .",
    "kondo singlet formation in the siam , which at zero field , quenches the sfs and hence leads to saturation of resistivity , is inhibited at finite fields , implying an increase in incoherent scattering and thus a positive magnetoresistance . in the lattice case , however , although magnetic field does inhibit the singlet - forming screening process of local moments , the periodicity of the local moments ( even though not fully screened ) , introduces lattice coherence which strongly suppresses incoherent scattering at low temperatures , and hence again leads to negative magnetoresistance .",
    "in other words , the incoherent scattering introduced by magnetic field in the siam through the inhibition of the screening process , is countered in the pam because of the presence of lattice / bloch coherence .",
    "it is possible that such an effect is enhanced in the present calculation due to the use of the dmft framework , since non - local dynamical fluctuations are completely neglected in this framework .",
    "the ata for the anderson lattice is in a subtle way somewhat similar to the the single - site dmft _ without the self - consistency_. which would imply that the effects of lattice coherence are probably suppressed in the ata , and hence positive magnetoresistance is observed .",
    "thus , we conclude that , at higher temperatures ( @xmath2 ) , suppression of the spin - flip scattering , and at lower temperatures , the presence of lattice coherence in the pam lead to negative magnetoresistance in the presence of a field for all @xmath68 .    the shift of coherence peak to higher @xmath68 with increasing field is a reflection of the increase in the low energy scale with field ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the latter result has been obtained for the siam as well  @xcite .",
    "since increasing interactions lead to an exponential decrease in @xmath0 , it appears that the polarizing effect of magnetic field is to counter the effect of interactions , and eventually at very large fields , wipe out local moment physics ( scattering / screening ) completely . at temperatures",
    "much higher than the field(@xmath142 ) , the effect of magnetic field is negligible implying that the magnetoresistance is almost zero .",
    "next , we compare our theoretical results with experiment .",
    "in this section we want to compare our theoretical results with experiment on @xmath8 .",
    "the rare - earth hexaboride @xmath143 has been investigated for many years  @xcite .",
    "the cubic - lattice system , at low temperatures , exhibits various magnetic phase transitions between 1.6 - 3.3k , which manifest clearly as kinks in the resistivity , above which the system is in a paramagnetic phase .",
    "it is the @xmath1443.3k phase that we concentrate on , since our approach does not describe the symmetry broken states .",

    "we use their data for comparison to our theory .    from an earlier study  @xcite",
    ", it is known that the hf system @xmath8 , belongs to the moderately strong coupling regime .",

    "the resistivity remains unaffected by magnetic field .",
    "this behaviour is natural and expected as discussed in section 3 . the application of magnetic field results in suppression of spin - spin scattering at @xmath2 , thus causing a reduction in resistivity . at low temperatures",

    "however , the highest field affects the resistivity upto a temperature of @xmath156 .",
    "such behaviour is characteristic of intermediate coupling regime  @xcite , which is consistent with the model parameters for ceb@xmath4 .    to compare the experimental results with our theory , two fundamental requirements need to be met .",

    "this is given by , @xmath159 where , a is a constant which comes from the error of the sample geometry to the measured resistivity . a detailed discussion of this point is given in ref  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we simply assume @xmath160 .",
    "the second is , the value of low - energy scale is needed for comparing our theoretical results with experiment . for this , we superposed the theoretical resistivity @xmath161 onto @xmath162 for @xmath63 to calculate the value of the low - energy scale .",
    "the value of the low energy scale turns out to be @xmath163 . assuming the @xmath164-factor to be roughly unity , the magnetic field of 1koe can be translated into multiples of the low energy scale . for @xmath165koe , @xmath166 .",
    "thus the magnetic fields employed in the experiments  @xcite turn out to be ( in multiples of @xmath0 ) , @xmath167 and @xmath168 corresponding to fields of @xmath169 0 , 20koe , 40koe , 60koe and 85koe respectively .",
    "so , given the model parameters and the low energy scale , along with the temperature range and the field range , we can compute the resistivity as a function of temperature at the same fields as in the experiment .    with a simple multiplicative scaling of the theoretical resistivities on the x - axis by the low energy scale and the y - axis by a single multiplicative factor ( same for all fields )",
    ", we show the theoretical computed dc resistivities for the same magnetic fields as the experiment in the right panel of figure  [ fig : graph4 ] .",
    "the experimental resistivity is found to rise more steeply than the theoretical one .",
    "the magnitude of magnetoresistivity is found to be higher in theory than the experiment .",
    "nevertheless the functional form agrees quite well . at @xmath170 , the magnetic field",
    "is seen to have very little effect on the resistivity , both in theory and experiment .",
    "below , 50k , the magnetoresistance in the theory is negative , which is also in agreement with experiment .",
    "the coherence peak is seen to move to higher @xmath68 with an increase in field , which behaviour is seen in the experiment as well . the small log - linear regime that appears at temperatures higher than the coherence peak temperature is also reproduced in the theory .",
    "thus , when compared with the experimental results in figure  [ fig : graph4 ] , good qualitative agreement is found between theory and experiment .",
    "in summary , we have employed a non - perturbative local moment approach to the asymmetric periodic anderson model within dmft in presence of magnetic field .",
    "field - dependent dynamics and transport properties of the model have been computed . in the strong coupling kondo lattice regime of the model , the local @xmath9- and @xmath11-electron spectral functions are found to exhibit universal scaling , being functions solely of @xmath171 ( @xmath172 being the low - energy scale ) for a given effective field @xmath79 .",
    "although the externally applied field is globally uniform , the effective local field experienced by the @xmath9- and @xmath11-electrons differs because of correlation effects .",
    "fermi liquid behaviour has been established even in presence of magnetic fields through adiabatic continuity to the non - interacting limit . in presence of magnetic field ,",
    "the quasiparticle peak at @xmath63 and @xmath62 splits into two .",
    "the shift of these peaks away from the fermi level is not rigid due to the competition between local moment screening and zeeman spin - polarization .",
    "although these shifts vary linearly with the field in strong coupling , the slope is enhanced as compared to the the non - interacting limit . finally , a comparison of theoretical magnetoresistance results with those of ceb@xmath4 , measured experimentally , yields good agreement .",
