    "combo-17 observed a 31.5@xmath1230arcmin@xmath41 region of the cdfs ( see fig.1 ) through a set of 5 broad - band and 12 narrow - band filters , which allowed the determination of accurate spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and absolute magnitudes for several thousand optically - selected sources ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "each sed was analyzed using a library of representative templates for various spectral types , and a redshift probability distribution was subsequently derived for each source . for a total of 24217  objects ,",
    "these distributions were successfully fitted with gaussian - like functions , the mean and the variance of which led to well - constrained estimates of photometric redshifts with corresponding uncertainties .",
    "these redshifts are accurate to 1% in @xmath44 for galaxies with @xmath45  21mag , and they are mostly reliable ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) for all sources at @xmath2@xmath41.2 and brighter than @xmath3@xmath024mag ( 11422  objects ) .",
    "the yield of high weight redshifts drops steeply for @xmath2@xmath61.2 or @xmath3@xmath624mag , so we did not consider such faint or distant objects .",
    "another redshift estimate is also provided for nearly every detection of the survey ( 62366  sources ) based on the peak of the computed probability distribution .",
    "because it is less reliable , it should be used with caution @xcite and was therefore also not considered in this work . about @xmath085% of the region covered by combo-17 overlaps with our mips 24@xmath1 m mosaic and the spectroscopic optical surveys .",
    "this overlapping area has a total field of view of 775arcmin@xmath41 ( see fig.1 ) .",

    "in this region of overlap we detected 5589  objects at 24@xmath1 m , with 3616 of those having a flux greater than the 80% completeness limit of 83@xmath1jy .",
    "we cross - correlated this 24@xmath1 m sub - sample with the optical data using a tolerance radius of 2  for matching sources .",
    "this choice was first motivated by the rather large fwhm of the mips 24@xmath1 m psf ( @xmath06 ) compared to that typically seen in optical images . as already observed in local interacting systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it also accounts for the physical shift that could be present between the location of the infrared emission and the brightest optical component of distant mergers ( 2  corresponds to a linear projection of @xmath015kpc on the sky at @xmath2@xmath01 ) .",
    "it is yet reasonably small given the position accuracy of the source centroids at 24@xmath1 m ( better than 0.5  rms ) . taking a larger value also increases the risk of associating mips sources with wrong optical counterparts in the case of multiple matches . when a double match was found , we selected the closest object .",
    "we ignored the cases where three or more optical sources could be associated with a given 24@xmath1 m detection .    we first correlated the 24@xmath1 m source catalog with the list of spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "a total of 543  matches was found in this cross - identification , of which 465  objects are flagged to have a high - confidence redshift measurement .",
    "the fraction of multiple matches was only 1% . at this stage",
    ", we only kept the identifications with a secure redshift determination .",
    "those 465  sources represent only 8% of the infrared - selected sub - sample , which emphasizes the critical need for using photometric redshifts . we thus cross - correlated the rest of the data with the catalog of combo-17 .",
    "we found 2170  mips sources ( 1987 single and 183 double matches ) identified with a photometric redshift below @xmath2=1.2 and an optical counterpart brighter than @xmath3=24mag . for 9  objects selected at 24@xmath1 m ( less than 0.5% of the sample ) three possible matches",
    "were found within 2  around the mips source .",
    "they were not further considered . in total , we assembled a catalog of 2635 mips sources ( of which 1962 are brighter than the 80% completeness limit of the 24@xmath1 m survey ) associated either with a reliable spectroscopic redshift or a clearly - constrained photometric redshift . virtually all are at @xmath2@xmath41.2 , since the yield of values at higher redshift is very low with both spectroscopy ( due to the `` redshift desert '' ) and combo-17 .",
    "we also identified another set of 1681 mips sources with an optical counterpart in the combo-17 catalog but without any reliable redshift ( 271 of them have @xmath5@xmath2183@xmath1jy and are brighter than @xmath3=24mag ) .",
    "since only a very small fraction of the mips sources have been identified with secure spectroscopic redshifts , it is worth looking at the typical uncertainties of the other _ photometric _ redshifts characterizing the 24@xmath1m - selected sources .",
    "the accuracy of the combo-17 classification decreases for sources fainter than @xmath3@xmath022mag .",
    "this may have non - negligible effects when estimating e.g. , source densities as a function of lookback time , especially when the uncertainties become comparable to the redshift bins in which galaxy properties are averaged .",
    "given that the 24@xmath1 m sample is by definition selected through the emission by warm dust , one may furthermore question whether the implied extinction at optical wavelengths can lead to a more significant redshift mis - classification in the specific case of the most luminous ( i.e. , dust - obscured ) mips sources .    in figures2a &  2b",
    "we compare high - confidence spectroscopic redshifts of optically - selected field galaxies and mips 24@xmath1 m detections with their photometric redshifts estimated by combo-17 .",
    "we see that the photometric redshift errors are small ( i.e. , @xmath47-@xmath48@xmath40.1 ) and they are not statistically larger in the case of the mips sources .",
    "the latter can be explained as follows .",
    "mid - infrared space - borne and ground - based observations of local lirgs / ulirgs reveal that the dust responsible for the bulk of the ir luminosity of those objects originates from very compact regions @xcite .",
    "the effect of extinction in these dusty systems is therefore very localized and is usually not apparent in the global spectral energy distribution of their optical counterparts @xcite .",
    "a similar situation likely pertains at higher redshifts up to at least @xmath2@xmath01 . at @xmath2@xmath00.7 for instance ,",
    "isocam  15@xmath1 m and mips  24@xmath1m - selected galaxies are indeed associated with luminous optical sources characterized by a wide range of optical colors and morphologies ( @xcite , bell et al .",
    "2005 ; see also sect.6 ) .",
    "only a careful approach based on medium - resolution spectroscopy can distinguish them from the optically - selected galaxy population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore unlikely to encounter any significant increase of redshift mis - classification _ as a function of infrared luminosity _",
    "( at least up to @xmath2@xmath01 ) .     0.2 cm .2 cm    finally , fig.2c shows the photometric redshift uncertainties provided by the combo-17 catalog as a function of the observed @xmath3-band magnitude for the mips sources considered in this paper .",
    "these errors were determined as the square root of the variance characterizing the redshift probability distribution of each object . in agreement with the comparison we made from fig.2a using the spectroscopic sub - sample",
    ", we see that sources brighter than @xmath3@xmath022mag have a very accurate redshift estimate ( i.e. , @xmath49@xmath40.04 ) and most of the sample ( 88% ) is characterized by a redshift accuracy better than @xmath49@xmath00.1 .",
    "the average uncertainty is only @xmath50@xmath51@xmath52=0.07 with a dispersion @xmath53=0.05 for sources with 22mag@xmath9@xmath54@xmath924mag .",
    "it rises to @xmath50@xmath51@xmath52=0.09 ( with a similar dispersion ) if we only consider objects fainter than @xmath3@xmath023mag . looking at the evolution of the mips sources",
    "averaged per redshift bin of @xmath55@xmath2@xmath00.2 should lead therefore to rather robust results .",
    "the biggest concern affecting our results is the incompleteness of the redshift determination for the most distant sources considered in this paper .",
    "as previously mentioned , 3616 objects were detected by mips above the 80% completeness limit in the region overlapping with the optical surveys of the cdfs , while our final catalog only contains 1962 sources with @xmath56@xmath2183@xmath1jy and a redshift identification ( i.e. , @xmath055% ) . to better",
    "assess this effect , we plot in figure  3.a the fraction of mips sources characterized either by a spectroscopic or a photometric redshift as a function of the observed 24@xmath1 m flux ( solid line ) as well as the fraction of their identification with an optical counterpart for various magnitude limits ( shaded regions ) . at the highest fluxes ( i.e. , @xmath57 1mjy ) ,",
    "the incompleteness of the sample is mostly due to a few objects detected close to very bright stars blooming the optical image and where a reliable identification of the counterpart can not be obtained .",
    "these cases should not introduce any bias in our results .",
    "below 1mjy , the drop in the redshift determination completeness corresponds to sources fainter than @xmath3@xmath023.5mag ( see also fig.3.b ) . above the 80% completeness limit of our mips data ( i.e. , 83@xmath1jy ) , we see for instance that a significant fraction ( @xmath025% ) of the mips objects with no redshift are associated with 24mag@xmath4@xmath3@xmath425.5mag sources , while @xmath020% of them have counterparts fainter than @xmath3@xmath625.5mag . this also indicates that a complete study of the faint mips population will likely require an extensive use of photometric redshift techniques .",
    "the consequence of this limitation can be seen by comparing the redshift determination completeness as a function of the @xmath3-band magnitude with the distribution of the @xmath3-band magnitudes of the mips sources for different redshift limits .",
    "this is shown in fig.3.b , while fig.3.c represents the absolute @xmath3-band magnitudes of the mips sources as a function of redsfhit and derived from combo-17 .",
    "we see that the identification should be nearly complete up to @xmath2@xmath00.8 , but we start missing 24@xmath1 m objects located at higher redshift and associated with optical counterparts fainter than @xmath3@xmath023.524mag .",
    "these mis - identifications likely induce a biais against the faintest sources detected at 24@xmath1 m .",
    "in sect.6 we will establish a correlation between the optical and the infrared luminosities of galaxies in our sample , and we will use such relation in sect.7 to quantify how this bias affects the estimates of luminosity functions ( see also the appendix for further details characterizing these faint 24@xmath1 m sources ) .",
    "however , given the importance of the cosmic variance arising from the variations of large scale structures in the cdfs ( see sect.3.4 ) , and taking into account the errors in the @xmath25-corrections used to derive ir  luminosities ( see sect.5 ) , we infer that the possible missing redshift determinations should not dominate the _",

    ".3 cm    0.2 cm .2 cm",
    "[ fig : z_distrib ]    other arguments also suggest that the bulk of the mips sources for which we could not identify any reliable redshift should be indeed located at @xmath2@xmath61 and will not affect this study .",
    "first we will show in the following sections that infrared luminous galaxies are associated with optical counterparts at the bright end of the luminosity function in the visible .",
    "luminous optical sources with l@xmath6l@xmath58 but fainter than @xmath3@xmath023.524mag should lie at @xmath2@xmath61 @xcite .",
    "moreover , preliminary results from @xmath59 reveal that a significant fraction of the mips sources are located at such large redshifts @xcite . finally ,",
    "although they are not fully reliable , the combo-17 redshift estimates based on the peak of the redshift probability distributions indicate that the majority of the sources that we have not identified should be at @xmath2@xmath61 .",
    "figure4 shows the distribution of the redshifts derived for our sample of infrared sources ( bottom panel , solid line ) .",
    "it is compared to the redshift distributions of the vvds ( dotted line ) and the combo-17 objects with @xmath60 ( dashed line ) .",
    "as previously discussed , the redshift identification of the mips sources is complete only up to @xmath2@xmath00.8 , and the distribution beyond this limit should thus be considered as a lower limit estimate .",
    ".3 cm    0.2 cm .2 cm [ fig : z_distrib ]    we note that the three distributions ( i.e. , mips , vvds , combo-17 ) are more or less similar from @xmath2@xmath00 to @xmath2@xmath01 . up to this redshift limit , mips is indeed sensitive to sources luminous in the infrared but also to more normal galaxies ( see sect.5 ) such as those detected at optical wavelengths and driving the vvds and combo-17 redshift distributions .",
    "furthermore , we note a significant number of objects around @xmath2@xmath00.65 , apparent in all the distributions .",
    "this originates from an overdensity characteristic of the cdfs near this redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and it is likely related to cosmic variance and large - scale structure effects @xcite .",
    "it may constitute a non negligible source of uncertainty in our density estimates .",
    "a comparison between the integrated @xmath61-band luminosity densities as a function of redshift from galaxies of the blue sequence ( bell , private communication , see willmer et al .",
    ", in prep .",
    ", for the evolution of the blue sequence luminosity function ) in the cdfs and averaged over the three fields of combo-17 @xcite shows that the cdfs is most often underdense by @xmath050% at 0@xmath621 , except indeed at @xmath2@xmath00.65@xmath230.1 where the overdensity reaches @xmath020% . given the similarity between the redshift distributions of the optically and infrared selected sources , and since most of mips sources at @xmath2@xmath00.7 appear to be associated with large spirals dominating the @xmath61-band emission ( bell et al . 2005 , see also fig.10b ) , this cosmic variance characterized from the @xmath61-band luminosity density is likely affecting also the population of galaxies detected at 24@xmath1 m .",
    "therefore the apparent peak at @xmath2@xmath00.65 in the mips redshift distribution is probably only related to the structure of the cdfs and it should not be a characteristic of the general population of infrared - selected sources .    in spite of the similarities that we observe between the redshift distributions in the visible and the infrared , a more critical look reveals that the fraction of optical sources brighter than m@xmath63=16 and detected at 24@xmath1 m decreases from @xmath2=0 to @xmath2@xmath00.4 and then increases with redshift up to @xmath2@xmath01 ( see fig.4 .",
    ", top panel ) . interpreting this trend is not straightforward , but it could reflect the difference in the @xmath25-correction effects observed at optical and infrared wavelengths . as we will see in sect.5",
    "( see figs.7 &  9 ) the effective sensitivity of the deep 24@xmath1 m observations drops rapidly from @xmath2=0 to @xmath2@xmath00.5 , which explains the sharp decrease of relative 24@xmath1 m detections in this redshift range .",
    "then it remains roughly constant at 0.5@xmath4@xmath2@xmath40.9 because of strong emission features present at 11.3 and 12.7@xmath1 m in galaxy spectra progressively entering the 24@xmath1 m filter at these redshifts .",
    "since the sensitivity of the optical data constantly drops with distance , an increase in the relative number of 24@xmath1 m sources detected beyond @xmath2@xmath00.5 in the visible might thus result .",
    "note that it may also reflect the stronger evolution of ir sources with lookback time , since ir - luminous phases in galaxies were more common in the past ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of apparent decline moreover suggests that the intrinsic peak of the mips population redshift distribution must lie at least beyond @xmath2@xmath00.8 .",
    "finally , another overdensity lies at @xmath2@xmath00.15 .",
    "it represents a rather small fraction of our detections at 24@xmath1 m ( i.e. , 4% ) . since we will only consider sources at @xmath2@xmath210.3 when building the luminosity functions in sect.7 , it will not affect our final results on the evolution of the ir  galaxy population",

    "following the detailed analysis and recipes by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , see their appendix a ) , we used the @xmath73-band absolute luminosities of galaxies from combo-17 ( converted to our cosmology ) and transformed these luminosities to stellar masses using rest - frame @xmath74 colors .",
    "figure10d illustrates the corresponding histograms for both samples of optically - selected sources ( thin solid line ) and of galaxies detected at 24@xmath1 m ( thick solid line ) .",
    "it is very clear that ir galaxies detected by mips are on average more massive ( i.e. , @xmath75@xmath610@xmath76@xmath77 ) than the field population of sources selected at optical wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , the 24@xmath1 m objects tend to be associated with even more massive galaxies when their ir luminosity ( and thus their star formation rate ) increases . as already observed in the case of 15@xmath1 m sources detected by @xmath14 at @xmath2@xmath41 @xcite , lirgs with l@xmath65@xmath610@xmath72l@xmath8 have most often counterparts with @xmath75@xmath610@xmath13@xmath77",
    ". in sect.8 we will discuss this issue within the more general context of the comoving star - forming activity at @xmath2@xmath01 .",
    "as a side note , we found a group of 91  sources ( among which 54 have @xmath56@xmath2183@xmath1jy ) identified with photometric redshifts and totally escaping the various relations illustrated on figs.10abc .",
    "these objects are rather faint in the optical ( @xmath3@xmath623mag ) , and their @xmath5/@xmath78 flux ratios are particularly high and typical of lirgs / ulirgs . according to our previous results , and given that most of them have disturbed merger morphologies chatacteristic of high redshift star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they are thus likely located at @xmath2@xmath60.5 - 0.6 , which is also supported by their morphologies since many of those are chatacteristic of high redshift star - forming galaxies .",
    "however they have been assigned very low redshifts by combo-17 , mostly in the apparent overdensity observed at @xmath2@xmath00.15 in the cdfs .",
    "this would imply faint infrared luminosities ( 10@xmath79l@xmath8@xmath4l@xmath67@xmath410@xmath13l@xmath8 , see fig.9 ) and optical absolute magnitudes much higher ( @xmath80@xmath6@xmath81 ) than expected from the correlations .",
    "we believe that these redshifts have probably been misidentified . we decided to exclude the corresponding sources from our sample .",
    "we explore in this section the evolution of ir luminosity functions ( lfs ) at 0@xmath4@xmath2@xmath41.2 .",
    "these lfs were derived for various redshift bins with the usual @xmath82 formalism @xcite applied to our sub - sample of sources brighter than @xmath83@xmath8483@xmath1jy and @xmath3=24mag .",
    "the selection function that was used in this goal was computed as follows .",
    "first , we considered the probability for a given object to verify our selection criterion at 24@xmath1 m .",
    "this probability equals  1 for sources brighter than @xmath0300@xmath1jy but decreases at fainter fluxes due to the incompleteness of the 24@xmath1 m catalog .",
    "the corresponding effect was quantified using the detailed simulations described by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , see their figure1 ) .",
    "second , we estimated the probability for a 24@xmath1 m source to be associated with an optical counterpart at @xmath3@xmath924mag . this probability is a redshift - dependent function , and it can be derived with an estimate of the absolute magnitude corresponding to the optical selection criterion ( @xmath3=24mag ) combined with the relation between the infrared and the optical luminosities established in the previous section . at this step , we actually assumed that 100% of sources with @xmath3@xmath924mag are detected by combo-17 .",
    "finally , we took into account the probability for a given optical source to be characterized by a redshift .",
    "this was done using the estimate of the redshift identification completeness that we determined in sect.3.3 for sources at @xmath3@xmath924mag .",
    "the computed selection function was subsequently used for each single galaxy of the sample to weight the differential volume elements that are integrated when calculating the total accessible volume @xmath85 . given the multi - wavelength flux limits considered here , this integration was performed up to the maximum redshift enabling the detection of the object at _ both _",
    "24@xmath1 m _ and _ optical wavelengths ( i.e. , the lowest value between the redshift where the 24@xmath1 m flux would drop below 83@xmath1jy and the redshift where the @xmath3-band magnitude would reach 24mag ) .",
    "the determination of the luminosity function was performed for each redshift range independently of the sources lying in the other bins .",
    "for this reason , the @xmath86 approach is more subject to density fluctuations than other methods like the stepwise maximum likelihood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even though cosmic variance is not negligible in cdfs , we will see however that the uncertainties affecting our conclusions are largely dominated by the errors on the @xmath25-corrections that are used to translate fluxes into luminosities .",
    "the @xmath86 technique might also be sensitive to the photometric redshift uncertainties , but as we already pointed out in sect.3.2 , the effect should be negligible here given the accuracy of the combo-17 redshift classification .      from the luminosity- dependent templates",
    "previously discussed , we converted the 24@xmath1 m observed fluxes into monochromatic luminosities at 12 , 15 , 25 and 60@xmath1 m as described in sect.5.2 .",
    "the latter were subsequently used to derive the associated luminosity functions that we finally compared to the local lfs derived from @xmath87 and @xmath14 . in figure11",
    "we illustrate the 15@xmath1 m lf @xmath88(l,@xmath2 ) estimated for different redshift bins .",
    "the corresponding data points are reported in table1 . at this wavelength",
    "the @xmath25-corrections needed to convert 24@xmath1 m fluxes into luminosities are minimized for most of the sources .",
    "the majority of sources are indeed located at 0.5@xmath4@xmath2@xmath40.8 where the mips 24@xmath1 m filter probes the 13.516@xmath1 m rest - frame wavength range .",
    "this behavior reduces the dependence of the luminosity functions on the assumed ir templates .",
    "we also show in figure12 the total ir lfs @xmath89(l,@xmath2 ) computed from the infrared luminosities shown in fig.9 .",
    "data points are given in table2 .",

    "as we already pointed out , lf uncertainties are largely dominated by the errors in the conversion between the 24@xmath1 m flux and the luminosities , and these errors are in fact minimized around 15@xmath1 m .",
    "furthermore , we see that @xmath88 might be characterized by a stronger evolution in density and a smaller evolution in luminosity compared to @xmath89 . this discrepancy could be a consequence of the non - negligible dispersion that exists in the correlations observed between fluxes at mid- and far - infrared wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "finally , it might be suggested that our scenario based on a single evolving population is overly simplistic . considering distinct object types characterized by their own evolution",
    "@xcite , bi - variate lfs @xcite or luminosity functions only evolving at their bright end @xcite could be one way to explore this effect in more detail .    in spite of this apparent degeneracy",
    ", it should be however noted that the evolution of the total luminosity density @xmath162 integrated from these infrared lfs is more tightly constrained than the evolution of the characteristic parameters @xmath163 and @xmath164 considered separately . in each redshift bin , mips can indeed detect those sources responsible for the bulk of the comoving luminosity density , and the additional uncertainty related to the extrapolation for taking account of the contribution of faint objects ( i.e. , faint - end slope of the lf , see sect.7.5 ) is therefore not dominant .",
    "based on the relation that we obtained between @xmath151 and @xmath150 , we find that @xmath162 evolves as ( 1+@xmath2)@xmath20 at 0@xmath4@xmath2@xmath41 ( see also sect.8 and fig.14 ) .    finally , we tested the effect of our redshift identification incompleteness at @xmath2@xmath61 on the lf estimates by computing @xmath152 including the observed luminosity function determined at 1@xmath9@xmath2@xmath91.2 .",
    "for both @xmath88 and @xmath89 the minimization of @xmath152 in this case leads to a short translation of the iso - probability contours toward smaller values of @xmath157 and larger values of @xmath158 compared to what we previously found .",

    "this constraint demarcates a specific region in the luminosity and density evolution parameter space , lying between the dashed and the dotted lines shown in the inset of figure12 . as we can see , the evolving parameters @xmath157 and @xmath158 that we derived from @xmath152 minimization in the previous section agree well with the known history of star formation up to @xmath2@xmath01 .",

    "a much more interesting constraint can be obtained from the source number counts .",
    "in fact we only considered 24@xmath1 m sources brighter than 83@xmath1jy when building the luminosity functions @xmath170 , but the counts at lower fluxes can be used to derive limits on the contribution of sources at luminosities fainter than those taken to minimize the @xmath152 . using the 24@xmath1 m observations of the `` goods test - field '' centered on elais - n1 ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite constrained the faint source density down to @xmath5@xmath030@xmath1jy and showed that the differential counts normalized to the euclidian slope are likely dropping very rapidly below this limit .",
    "we must therefore ensure that the evolution of the infrared lf does not lead to an overproduction of these counts at faint fluxes . to check the latter we derived as a function of @xmath157 and @xmath158 the differential number counts that would be produced up to @xmath2=1 by a population of sources described by @xmath170 and evolving as given by equation2 ( see fig.13 ) .",

    "as a result we are likely underestimating the total star formation rate density by a factor ranging between @xmath02030% at @xmath2@xmath01 ( where dusty galaxies dominate the sfr ) and @xmath06070% at @xmath2@xmath00 ( where the star - forming activity occurs within fainter sources with low extinction )",
    ". this effect can be seen by considering , in addition to the ir emission , the evolution of the uv luminosity ( uncorrected for dust extinction ) with redshift .",
    "using galex data , @xcite found that the energy density measured at 1500   evolves as ( 1+@xmath2)@xmath200 at 0@xmath4@xmath2@xmath41 , which is also consistent with previous uv measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "an estimate of the total star formation rate density ( represented as a dotted line in fig.14 ) can thus be obtained by adding the contribution of the equivalent uv - uncorrected sfr ( dashed line in fig.14 ) to our best fit of the evolution of the ir star formation estimate ( converted from the energy density @xmath162 evolving as ( 1+@xmath2)@xmath201 ) .",
    "this clearly shows that the ir emission provides a good approximation of the total sfr density at @xmath2@xmath01 given the uncertainties affecting its current measurements ( i.e. , conversion between flux and luminosity , cosmic variance ) .",
    "one can see that the global evolution of the luminosity function leads to a source density increase for both populations of ir - luminous and low luminosity galaxies .",
    "however the larger increase of @xmath202 compared to @xmath203 results in a much more rapid evolution of sources characterized by the highest bolometric luminosities .",
    "the contribution of ir luminous galaxies , though negligible in the local universe , becomes comparable to that of normal starbursts around @xmath2@xmath00.7 and they dominate beyond .",
    "we also see that such ir luminous sources are mostly dominated by lirg - type objects up to @xmath2@xmath01 and that ulirgs still have a modest impact ( @xmath010% ) at this redshift .",
    "this is once again in good agreement with the isocam surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however these ulirgs have undergone the fastest evolution in the last 8gyrs and our results suggest that their contribution is likely still rising at @xmath2@xmath61 . as already revealed by the submillimeter surveys ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , they may therefore be responsible for a very significant fraction of the star - forming activity of the universe at @xmath2@xmath023 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "how can this strong evolution observed in the infrared be understood in the general context of the growth of structures  ?",
    "there is now increasing evidence that the most massive galaxies seem to have formed their stars early in cosmic history and that their contribution to the comoving sfr density of the universe was significantly larger at higher redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly it has been shown that a significant fraction of galaxies with masses @xmath75@xmath610@xmath13@xmath77 at @xmath2@xmath00.7 - 1.0 are experiencing a violent episode of star formation , while nearly all equally - massive sources at the present day are found in a very quiescent mode ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in parallel to this downsizing effect characteristic of the stellar mass assembly history ,",
    "the evolution of the luminosity function at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths reveals a transfer of the star formation from the most luminous high redshift sources to more modest local starbursts .",
    "if we consider that lirgs and ulirgs are preferentially associated with more massive systems ( see fig.10d ) , this result might be closely related to the mass growth picture described above .",
    "however the connection between the two is likely more subtle as we found that the fraction of ir luminous sources with @xmath75@xmath410@xmath13@xmath77 is not negligible either .",
    "the relation between ir luminosities and masses has indeed a large dispersion and the dominant contribution of lirgs / ulirgs to the star formation at @xmath2@xmath01 does not necessarily imply that the sfr at these redshifts is only locked in massive systems .",
    "a similar conclusion has been proposed by @xcite , who showed that the star formation density at @xmath2@xmath01 was dominated by systems with @xmath75@xmath410@xmath204@xmath77 .",
    "much larger samples of sources will be required to address this issue in more detail , especially by de - projecting the comoving sfr density into the ir - luminosity / mass / redshift 3-dimensional space .",
    "this goal could be achieved in the very near future by combining all the mips cosmological surveys that are currently being carried out with _ spitzer . _",
    "we have analyzed a sample of mips/_spitzer _",
    "24@xmath1 m sources detected in the chandra deep field south using ancillary optical data from the literature ( i.e. , magnitudes , spectroscopic and photometric redshifts ) .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * for 24@xmath1 m sources brighter than @xmath080@xmath1jy , the selection criterion @xmath3@xmath424mag provides a complete sample of optical counterpart identifications up to @xmath2@xmath00.8 . * about 55 - 60% of the 24@xmath1 m objects",
    "brighter than @xmath080@xmath1jy are located at @xmath2@xmath41 , which points to a significant fraction of the mips 24@xmath1 m sources being luminous and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies at even higher redshifts . *",
    "the 24@xmath1 m source population at 0.5@xmath4@xmath2@xmath41.0 is dominated by lirg - type objects and slightly fainter sources ( i.e. , l@xmath67@xmath410@xmath7l@xmath65 ) .",
    "ulirgs are found to be rare at these redshifts . *",
    "the conversion between fluxes and luminosities depends strongly on the assumed infrared seds .",
    "this points to a crucial need for more accurate determinations of ir templates , a goal which could be achieved with mips and irs . * as in the local universe , infrared luminous sources up to @xmath2@xmath01 are also luminous at optical wavelengths and they tend to be more massive than the bulk of optically - selected distant galaxies . * the comoving energy density measured in the infrared evolves as ( 1+@xmath2)@xmath20 at 0@xmath4@xmath2@xmath41 . in contrast , the luminosity density in the uv only evolves as ( 1+@xmath2)@xmath24 over the similar redshift range .",
    "this points to a more important extinction by dust reprocessing light in the ir at high redshift . *",
    "the infrared - selected sources at 0@xmath4@xmath2@xmath41 have undergone strong evolution characterized by @xmath192@xmath16(1+@xmath2)@xmath17 and @xmath175@xmath16(1+@xmath2)@xmath19 . at @xmath2@xmath01 , infrared luminous galaxies ( i.e. , l@xmath67@xmath610@xmath7l@xmath22 ) appear to be responsible for 70@xmath2315% of the comoving ir energy density .",

    "in this work we imposed a selection criterion @xmath3@xmath924mag when considering the 24@xmath1 m sources identified with a photometric redshift from the combo-17 survey . as we showed in sect.3",
    ", this selection obviously results in an incompleteness of the mips - selected population at @xmath2@xmath60.8 - 1.0 .",
    "we provide in this appendix a few more details characterizing the possible nature of the sources that we may have missed in the estimate of the lfs at high redshift .    in figure15",
    "we show the relation between the @xmath205 color and the @xmath3-band magnitude of the mips sources identified with an optical counterpart from combo-17 ( top panel ) .",
    "the 24@xmath1 m vega magnitudes were calculated assuming a zero point of 7.3jy as defined in the _ spitzer observing manual . _ as pointed out in sect.6 , the apparently well - defined correlation that is observed is a natural consequence of the small range of 24@xmath1 m fluxes ( typically a factor of @xmath010 over our sample ) compared to the much larger range ( @xmath05 magnitudes ) covered by the optical counterparts of the mips sources ( see also fig.8a ) .",
    "if we only consider 24@xmath1 m objects brighter than the 80% completeness of our survey ( i.e. , @xmath83@xmath2183@xmath1jy ) , we see that the selection at @xmath3=24mag defines a complete sample up to @xmath205@xmath011.6 .",
    "we miss therefore the reddest sources of the mips catalog ( shaded region of fig.1 ) .      to get a hint into the possible nature of these targets , we also plot in figure15 the total infrared luminosities ( as derived in sect.5 ) versus the @xmath205 colors for the mips sources identified with a spectroscopic or a photometric redshift ( bottom panel ) .",
    "different symbols are used to highlight sources as a function of the @xmath3-band magnitude . as we see , 24@xmath1 m objects redder than @xmath206@xmath011.6 are not obviously the most extreme in terms of dust emission and their luminosity can vary between @xmath05@xmath1210@xmath13l@xmath22 and a few  10@xmath11l@xmath22 in the infrared . even though sources fainter than @xmath3@xmath024mag may follow a different trend , this dispersion of l@xmath65 with both the color and the @xmath3-band magnitude suggests that these sources span a wide range of ir luminosities . taking into account the evolution of the sensivity limit with redshift in our 24@xmath1 m survey ( see fig.7 ) , they should thus be located in a wide range of redshifts at @xmath2@xmath61 ."
