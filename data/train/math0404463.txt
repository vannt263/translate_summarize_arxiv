    "let @xmath44 be a closed smooth submanifold of a nonsingular algebraic set @xmath9 .",
    "the problem of whether @xmath45 is isotopic to a nonsingular algebraic subset of @xmath9 is an old one . if we allow stabilization ( replacing @xmath9 by @xmath46 for sufficiently large @xmath28 ) the problem becomes solvable ( @xcite and @xcite for the affine case , @xcite for the projective case , and @xcite for the general case where there are obstructions ) .",

    "we need a very special case of these theorems , the one which allows us to isotop some submanifolds of @xmath0 ( the examples in the next section ) to projectively closed algebraic subsets .",
    "obviously the following lemmas hold in more general contexts , but to make the examples of the main theorem in the next section transparent , we chose to state them in this special form , which is enough to prove the theorem .",
    "every closed codimension one submanifold of @xmath49 can be approximated by a nonsingular projectively closed algebraic subset .",
    "this for example is proven in @xcite ( also theorem 2.8.2 of @xcite ) , but can also be seen from seifert s original proof @xcite by noting that the highest degree terms of the polynomial he constructs are a constant times @xmath50 ( clearly the zeros of such polynomials are projectively closed algebraic sets ) .",

    "we can isotop @xmath57 to a nonsingular topological component @xmath58 of a real algebraic subvariety of @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath59 be one of the codimension zero components of @xmath60 , and let @xmath61 be the boundary of a small tubular neighborhood of @xmath62 in @xmath49 .",
    "by lemma 2 above we can isotop @xmath63 to a projectively closed nonsingular algebraic subvariety @xmath64 of @xmath49 . then @xmath65 gives the desired variety .",
    "@xmath9 is projectively closed since @xmath64 is projectively closed .",
    "in @xcite we constructed smooth submanifolds @xmath47 which are isotopic to nonsingular algebraic subsets of @xmath66 , but not isotopic to the real parts of nonsingular complex algebraic subsets of @xmath1 .",
    "so , this means that either every algebraic model of @xmath45 in @xmath67 develops extra components at infinity when its zariski closure is taken in @xmath68 ( i.e. it is not projectively closed ) , or @xmath45 admits nonsingular algebraic models in @xmath69 but the complexifications all such models necessarily contain singular points in @xmath70 .",
    "the following theorem eliminates the first possibility , hence it gives genuine topological obstructions to moving smooth submanifolds of @xmath4 to nonsingular algebraic sets in the strong sense ( i.e. no singularities in complexification ) .",
    "there are closed smooth submanifolds @xmath71 which can be approximated ( via a small isotopy ) by nonsingular subvarieties of @xmath72 , but they can not be isotoped to the real parts of nonsingular complex algebraic subvarieties of @xmath8 defined over @xmath10 .    by @xcite for any @xmath73 there is an @xmath74 such that we have an imbedding @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 in @xmath69 , so by lemma 2 above @xmath45 can be isotoped to a nonsingular projectively closed algebraic subset @xmath79 of @xmath69 where @xmath80 .",
    "we claim that when @xmath81 when @xmath74 is even , and @xmath82 when @xmath83 , @xmath9 can not be the real part of a nonsingular complex algebraic subset @xmath84 of @xmath1 ( defined over @xmath10 ) .",
    "suppose such a @xmath84 exists . by a version of the lefschetz hyperplane theorem due to larsen @xcite , for @xmath85",
    ", the restriction induces an isomorphism @xmath86 in particular when @xmath87 , the group @xmath88 lies in the the image of @xmath89 under restriction .",
    "but since @xmath9 lies in a chart @xmath66 of @xmath0 , from the diagram      we conclude that @xmath91 for @xmath92 . on the other hand by @xcite",
    "the stiefel - whitney classes of @xmath9 are represented by real algebraic subsets since @xmath9 is a nonsingular real algebraic set .",
    "hence , when @xmath74 is even @xmath93 is algebraic , also when @xmath83 then @xmath94 is algebraic , where @xmath95 is the generator of @xmath96 .",
    "so when @xmath74 is even and @xmath81 , or when @xmath83 and @xmath97 we get a contradiction to theorem 1 above , for example when @xmath74 is even @xmath98    we should point out that the above mentioned theorem of @xcite actually implies that there are imbeddings @xmath75 for the pairs @xmath99 with @xmath74 even and @xmath81 , or @xmath83 and @xmath82 .",
    "this is what is used in the proof .",
    "recall that on any nonsingular real algebraic variety structure @xmath9 of a smooth manifold @xmath45 , the stiefel - whitney classes , and mod @xmath38 reductions of pontryagin classes of @xmath45 are algebraic in @xmath9 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "so the examples in the above theorem generalize many directions .",
    "for example we can take @xmath100 to be any closed smooth manifold which admits a separating imbedding into a closed manifold @xmath101 , such that @xmath102 with @xmath103 , and @xmath104 such that @xmath105 and @xmath95 lies in the subring of the cohomology group generated by stiefel - whitney and pontryagin classes ."
