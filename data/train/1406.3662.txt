    "these exponential models are commonly used to model real - world networks as they are able to capture a wide variety of common _ network tendencies _ by representing a complex global structure through a set of tractable local features @xcite .",
    "intuitively , we can think of the @xmath3 parameters @xmath16 as tuning parameters that allow one to adjust the influence of different subgraphs @xmath17 of @xmath1 on the probability distribution , whose asymptotics will be our main interest since networks are often very large in size .",
    "our main results are ( theorem [ main1 ] ) a variational principle for the normalization constant ( partition function ) for graphons with constrained edge density , and an associated concentration of measure ( theorem [ main2 ] ) indicating that almost all large constrained graphs lie near the maximizing set .",
    "we then specialize to the edge - triangle model , and show the existence of ( first - order ) phase transitions in the edge - density constrained models .",

    "_ we thank charles radin , kui ren , and lorenzo sadun for helpful conversations .",
    "we begin by reviewing some notation and results concerning the theory of graph limits and its use in exponential random graph models . following the earlier work of aldous @xcite and hoover @xcite , lovsz and coauthors ( v.t .",
    "ss , b. szegedy , c. borgs , j. chayes , k. vesztergombi , ... ) have constructed an elegant theory of graph limits in a sequence of papers @xcite .",
    "see also the recent book @xcite for a comprehensive account and references .",
    "this sheds light on various topics such as graph testing and extremal graph theory , and has found applications in statistics and related areas ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "though their theory has been developed for dense graphs ( number of edges comparable to the square of number of vertices ) , serious attempts have been made at formulating parallel results for sparse graphs @xcite .",
    "here are the basics of this beautiful theory .",
    "any simple graph @xmath1 , irrespective of the number of vertices , may be represented as an element @xmath18 of a single abstract space @xmath19 that consists of all symmetric measurable functions from @xmath20 ^ 2 $ ] into @xmath20 $ ] , by defining @xmath21 a sequence of graphs @xmath22 is said to converge to a function @xmath23 ( referred to as a `` graph limit '' or `` graphon '' ) if for every finite simple graph @xmath24 with vertex set @xmath25=\\{1, ... ,k\\}$ ] and edge set @xmath26 , @xmath27 where @xmath28 , the graph homomorphism density ( [ t ] ) , by construction , and @xmath29^k}\\prod_{\\{i , j\\}\\in e(h)}h(x_i , x_j)dx_1\\cdots dx_k.\\ ] ] indeed every function in @xmath19 arises as the limit of a certain graph sequence @xcite .",
    "intuitively , the interval @xmath20 $ ] represents a `` continuum '' of vertices , and @xmath30 denotes the probability of putting an edge between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "for example , for the erds - rnyi random graph @xmath33 , the `` graphon '' is represented by the function that is identically equal to @xmath34 on @xmath20 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "this `` graphon '' interpretation enables us to capture the notion of convergence in terms of subgraph densities by an explicit metric on @xmath19 , the so - called `` cut distance '' : @xmath35}\\left|\\int_{s\\times t}\\left(f(x , y)-h(x , y)\\right)dx\\,dy\\right|\\ ] ] for @xmath36 .",
    "a non - trivial complication is that the topology induced by the cut metric is well defined only up to measure preserving transformations of @xmath20 $ ] ( and up to sets of lebesgue measure zero ) , which in the context of finite graphs may be thought of as vertex relabeling .",
    "to tackle this issue , an equivalence relation @xmath37 is introduced in @xmath19 .",
    "we say that @xmath38 if @xmath39 for some measure preserving bijection @xmath40 of @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath41 ( referred to as a `` reduced graphon '' ) denote the equivalence class of @xmath42 in @xmath43 .",
    "since @xmath44 is invariant under @xmath40 , one can then define on the resulting quotient space @xmath45 the natural distance @xmath46 by @xmath47 , where the infimum ranges over all measure preserving bijections @xmath48 and @xmath49 , making @xmath50 into a metric space . with some abuse of notation we also refer to @xmath46 as the `` cut distance '' .",
    "the space @xmath50 enjoys many important properties that are essential for the study of exponential random graph models .",
    "for example , it is a compact space and homomorphism densities @xmath51 are continuous functions on it .    for the purpose of this paper , two theorems from chatterjee and diaconis @xcite (",
    "both based on a large deviation result established in chatterjee and varadhan @xcite ) merit some special attention .",
    "together they connect the occurrence of a phase transition in the exponential model with the solution of a certain maximization problem .",
    "their results are formulated in terms of general exponential models where the terms in the exponent defining the probability measure may contain functions on the graph space other than homomorphism densities , as alluded to at the beginning of this paper .",
    "let @xmath52 be a bounded continuous function .",
    "let the probability measure @xmath53 and the normalization constant @xmath54 be defined as in ( [ pmf ] ) and ( [ psi ] ) , that is , @xmath55 @xmath56 the first theorem ( theorem 3.1 in @xcite ) states that the limiting normalization constant @xmath57 of the exponential random graph , which is crucial for the computation of maximum likelihood estimates , always exists and is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is first defined as a function from @xmath60 $ ] to @xmath61 as @xmath62 and then extended to @xmath45 in the usual manner : @xmath63 ^ 2}i(h(x , y))\\,dx\\,dy,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is any representative element of the equivalence class @xmath41 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath59 is well defined and lower semi - continuous on @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath64 be the subset of @xmath45 where @xmath65 is maximized . by the compactness of @xmath45 , the continuity of @xmath66 and the lower semi - continuity of @xmath59",
    ", @xmath64 is a nonempty compact set .",
    "the set @xmath64 encodes important information about the exponential model ( [ pmf2 ] ) and helps to predict the behavior of a typical random graph sampled from this model . the second theorem ( theorem 3.2 in @xcite )",
    "states that in the large @xmath2 limit , the quotient image @xmath67 of a random graph @xmath1 drawn from ( [ pmf2 ] ) must lie close to @xmath64 with high probability , @xmath68 since the limiting normalization constant @xmath65 is the generating function for the limiting expectations of other random variables on the graph space such as expectations and correlations of homomorphism densities , a phase transition occurs when @xmath65 is non - analytic or when @xmath64 is not a singleton set .",
    "the exponential family of random graphs introduced above assumes no prior knowledge of the graph before sampling .",
    "but in many situations partial information of the graph is already known beforehand .",
    "for example , practitioners might be told that the edge density of the graph is close to @xmath69 or the triangle density is close to @xmath70 or the adjacency matrix of the graph obeys a certain form . a natural question to ask then is what would be a typical random graph drawn from an exponential model subject to these constraints ? or perhaps more importantly",
    "will there be a similar phase transition phenomenon as in the unconstrained exponential model ?",
    "the following theorems [ main1 ] and [ main2 ] give a detailed answer to these questions .",
    "not surprisingly , the proofs follow a similar line of reasoning as in theorems 3.1 and 3.2 of @xcite . however , due to the imposed constraints , instead of working with probability measure @xmath53 and normalization constant @xmath54 as in @xcite",
    ", we are working with conditional probability measure and conditional normalization constant , so the argument is more involved .",
    "the proof of theorem [ main1 ] also incorporates some ideas from theorem 3.1 of @xcite .    for clarity ,",
    "we assume that the edge density of the graph is approximately known , though the proof runs through without much modification for more general constraints .",
    "we make precise the notion of `` approximately known '' below .",
    "we still assign a probability measure @xmath53 as in ( [ pmf2 ] ) on @xmath5 , but we will consider a conditional normalization constant and also define a conditional probability measure . let @xmath71 $ ] be a real parameter that signifies an `` ideal '' edge density .",
    "take @xmath72 .",
    "the conditional normalization constant @xmath73 is defined analogously to the normalization constant for the unconstrained exponential random graph model , @xmath74 the difference being that we are only taking into account graphs @xmath1 whose edge density @xmath75 is within an @xmath76 neighborhood of @xmath77 .",
    "correspondingly , the associated conditional probability measure @xmath78 is given by @xmath79 we perform two limit operations on @xmath73 .",
    "first we take @xmath2 to infinity , then we shrink the interval around @xmath77 by letting @xmath76 go to zero : @xmath80 intuitively , these two operations ensure that we are examining the asymptotics of exponentially weighted large graphs with edge density sufficiently close to @xmath77 .",
    "theorem [ main1 ] shows that this is indeed the case .",

    "consequently , @xmath162 substituting this in ( [ supsup ] ) gives @xmath163 this completes the proof .",
    "theorems [ main1 ] and [ main2 ] in the previous section illustrate the importance of finding the maximizing graphons for @xmath151 subject to certain constraints .",
    "they aid us in understanding the limiting conditional probability distribution and the global structure of a random graph @xmath1 drawn from the constrained exponential model .",
    "indeed knowledge of such graphons would help us understand the limiting probability distribution and the global structure of a random graph @xmath1 drawn from the unconstrained exponential model as well , since we can always carry out the unconstrained optimization in steps : first consider a constrained optimization ( referred to as `` micro analysis '' ) , then take into consideration of all possible constraints ( referred to as `` macro analysis '' ) . however , as straight - forward as it sounds , due to the myriad of structural possibilities of graphons , both the unconstrained ( [ setmax ] ) and constrained ( [ csetmax ] ) optimization problems are not always explicitly solvable .",
    "so far major simplification has only been achieved in the `` attractive '' case @xcite and for @xmath3-star models @xcite , whereas a complete analysis of either ( [ setmax ] ) or ( [ csetmax ] ) in the `` repulsive '' region has proved to be very difficult . this section will provide some phase transition results on the constrained `` repulsive '' edge - triangle exponential random graph model and discuss their possible generalizations . as we will see , they come in accordance with their unconstrained counterparts .",
    "we make these notions precise in the following .",
    "the unconstrained edge - triangle model is a @xmath164-parameter exponential random graph model obtained by taking @xmath10 to be a single edge and @xmath165 to be a triangle in ( [ pmf ] ) .",
    "more explicitly , in the edge - triangle model , the probability measure @xmath4 is @xmath166 where @xmath167 are @xmath164 real parameters , @xmath75 and @xmath168 are the edge and triangle densities of @xmath1 , and @xmath169 is the normalization constant . as before , we assume that the ideal edge density @xmath77 is fixed .",
    "the limiting construction described at the beginning of section [ 2 ] will then yield the asymptotic conditional normalization constant @xmath170 . from ( [ csetmax ] ) we see that @xmath170 depends on both parameters @xmath171 and @xmath172 , however the @xmath171 dependence is linear : @xmath170 is equal to @xmath173 plus a function independent of @xmath171 .",
    "in particular @xmath171 plays no role in the maximization problem , so we can consider it fixed at value @xmath174 .",
    "the only relevant parameters then are @xmath77 and @xmath172 .    to highlight this parameter dependence , in the following we will write @xmath170 as @xmath175 instead .",
    "we are particularly interested in the asymptotics of @xmath175 when @xmath172 is negative , the so - called repulsive region .",
    "naturally , varying @xmath172 allows one to adjust the influence of the triangle density of the graph on the probability distribution .",
    "the more negative the @xmath172 , the more unlikely that graphs with a large number of triangles will be observed .",
    "when @xmath172 approaches negative infinity , the most probable graph would likely be triangle free . at the other extreme ,",
    "when @xmath172 is zero , the edge - triangle model reduces to the well - studied erds - rnyi model , where edges between different vertex pairs are independently included .",
    "the structure of triangle free graphs and disordered erds - rnyi graphs are apparently quite different , and thus a phase transition is expected as @xmath172 decays from @xmath176 to @xmath177 .",
    "in fact , it is believed that , quite generally , repulsive models exhibit a transition qualitatively like the solid / fluid transition , in that a region of parameter space depicting emergent multipartite structure , which is in imitation of the structure of solids , is separated by a phase transition from a region of disordered graphs , which resemble fluids .",
    "the existence of such a transition in unconstrained @xmath164-parameter models whose subgraph @xmath165 has chromatic number at least @xmath178 has been proved by aristoff and radin @xcite based on a symmetry breaking result from @xcite .",
    "theorem [ csep ] below gives a corresponding result in the constrained edge - triangle model .",
    "its proof though is quite different from the parallel result in @xcite and relies instead on some analysis arguments .",
    "we also remark that , using the same arguments , it is possible to establish the phase transition as @xmath172 grows from @xmath176 to @xmath179 , i.e. , in the `` attractive '' region of the parameter space .",
    "there , combined with simulation results , we could conclude that a typical graph consists of one big clique and some isolated vertices as @xmath172 gets sufficiently close to infinity .",
    "[ csep ] consider the constrained repulsive edge - triangle exponential random graph model as described above .",
    "let @xmath77 be arbitrary but fixed .",
    "let @xmath172 vary from @xmath176 to @xmath177 .",
    "then @xmath175 is not analytic at at least one value of @xmath172 .",
    "we first consider the case @xmath180 ; the case @xmath181 is similar , see the comments at the end of the proof .",
    "let @xmath182 be the edge density of a reduced graphon @xmath41 and @xmath183 be the triangle density , obtained by taking @xmath24 to be a triangle in ( [ tt ] ) . by ( [ csetmax ] ) , @xmath184 where for notational convenience , we denote by @xmath185 the maximum value of @xmath186 over",
    "all reduced graphons with @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "we examine ( [ etsetmax ] ) at the two extreme values of @xmath172 first . since @xmath59 is convex , when @xmath189 , @xmath190 by jensen s inequality , and the equality is attained only when @xmath191 , the associated graphon for an erds - rnyi graph with edge formation probability @xmath77 .",
    "this also ensures that when we take @xmath192 , any maximizing graphon @xmath42 for ( [ etsetmax ] ) will satisfy @xmath193 . for",

    "thus @xmath203 .",
    "the rest of the proof will utilize the following useful features of @xmath185 derived in radin and sadun @xcite : for @xmath180 , @xmath204 and this maximum is achieved only at the reduced graphon @xmath41 ( [ h ] ) , corresponding to a complete bipartite graph with @xmath205 fraction of edges randomly deleted .",
