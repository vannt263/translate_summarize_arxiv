    "the coulomb blockade of the current through a system of ultrasmall tunnel junctions is one of the basic features of single electronics .",
    "there are two simple systems capable of producing this blockade if connected to a voltage source , namely the single junction within a high - impedant environment and the double junction . owing to their different features",
    "the theoretical description of the former is much more simple than that of the latter , whereas manufacturing favors the latter instead of the former .    in this paper",
    "we study theoretically the crossover from double - junction behavior to single - junction behavior in the usually scanning - tunneling - microscope setup.@xcite the tip junction , i.e.  where the outer electrode is formed by the microscope tip , is characterized by the resistance @xmath0 and the capacitance @xmath1 , whereas the corresponding parameters of the other junction are denoted @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the crossover between double - junction regime and single - junction regime is governed by the temperature of the microscope tip , @xmath4 , which is thought to be independent of the temperature of the other electrodes , @xmath5 .",
    "we discuss the case @xmath6 only . in order to observe a coulomb blockade the base temperature",
    "is restricted to values @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the coulomb energy of the double junction .",
    "if the tip temperature is comparable to the base temperature , a usual double - junction behavior is expected .",
    "its theoretical description is the so - called `` orthodox theory'':@xcite a master equation describes the occupation probability of different charge states of the small island between the two junctions .",
    "the current through the system is expressed in terms of these probabilities .",
    "if the tip temperature is well above @xmath5 , thermal fluctuations will make the tip junction more transparent . however , its resistance is still large on the scale of the quantum resistance @xmath9 .",
    "thus we have the typical single - junction setup : an ultrasmall tunnel junction at base temperature and an high impedant almost ohmic environment resistance .",
    "the small capacitance of the latter is negligible .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical approximations for our discussion are given in the next section .",
    "after this follow the discussion itself and the conclusion .",
    "the ultrasmall double junction is described in terms of standard `` orthodox theory''.@xcite assuming the tunnel rates through the first ( @xmath10 ) and second ( @xmath11 ) junction in right ( @xmath12 ) and left ( @xmath13 ) direction are known as @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 extra charges on the central island , the time dependence of the occupation probability @xmath17 of the state @xmath16 follows from the master equation@xcite @xmath18\\sigma(n-1,t)\\\\ & & + \\big[r_2(n+1)+l_1(n+1)\\big]\\sigma(n+1,t)\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\big[r_1(n)+r_2(n)+l_1(n)+l_2(n)\\big]\\sigma(n , t).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the considered stationary situation we use the stationary solution of this equation@xcite @xmath19\\\\ & & \\times\\prod_{j = n+1}^{\\infty}\\big[r_2(j)+l_1(j)\\big]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with an appropriate normalization @xmath20 so that @xmath21 the stationary average current results from @xmath17 @xmath22\\sigma(n)\\\\ & = & e\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\big[r_2(n)-l_2(n)\\big ] \\sigma(n).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us consider the transition rates @xmath14 and @xmath15 in detail now .",

    ", ( [ ratene ] ) is a reasonable approximation for @xmath28 .",
    "[ ratene ] indicates that the tunneling behavior in this case is governed by the higher temperature .",
    "the influence of the temperature difference results in the change of ( [ ratene ] ) in comparison to ( [ rateeq ] ) .      since the single - junction regime requires a warm tip we consider the hot environment only . in this case",
    "the energy excitation probability of the environment @xmath29 is given by a gaussian@xcite @xmath30\\ ] ] where we introduced the single - junction charging energy @xmath31 and @xmath32 describes the elevated environment temperature .",
    "[ pehot ] fulfills the sum rules@xcite @xmath33    in ref .",
    "a lorentzian shape is derived for the hot environment and negligible charging energy , but we have not found satisfactory results with that formula . in the considered temperature range charging effects are still essential as can be seen from the occurance of the coulomb blockade .",
    "hence , the situation here might be well outside the scope of the lorentzian formula of ref .  .",
    "the single junction at @xmath5 is described by two rates , namely @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "their functional dependence on the energy difference between both sides of the junction follows ( [ rateeq ] ) , but the energies @xmath36 are the voltage drops across the junction . for low base temperature",
    "we can make use of the approximation@xcite @xmath37 with @xmath38 from the normalization @xmath39    this allows for an analytic expression of the current through the junction @xmath40,\\ ] ] where we use @xmath41 .",
    "the current is calculated in terms of the voltage @xmath42 across the single junction , which does not include the voltage drop @xmath43 at the tip junction .",

    "=    in fig .  [ fig1 ] the result of our calculation are shown for the case of an asymmetric double junction .",
    "double junction systems where an stm forms one junction are very often asymmetric .",
    "this asymmetry results in a coulomb staircase as seen for the low temperature curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for higher tip temperature",
    "the stairs are smeared out , but the coulomb blockade survives .",
    "this is the expected behavior of a single junction in a high - impedant environment .",
    "the curve is fitted well by our model of the hot environment and the derived current ( [ ihot ] ) .",
    "the fit parameter is the temperature @xmath48 , which is found between the low temperature @xmath5 and the hot @xmath4 .",
    "thus , it does not take wonder that the displayed zero - temperature approximation of @xmath29 can not describe the the double - junction system .",
    "=    an interesting remaining question is the dependence of the environment temperature @xmath49 on the choice of the base temperature @xmath5 and the tip temperature @xmath4 . since @xmath48 is a theoretical parameter of our model we investigated this dependence by means of a fit procedure .",
    "the results ( for the system of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "@xmath49 is well above @xmath5 , which corresponds to the results found in ref .   for the single - electron electrometer .",
    "we restrict the consideration to the case @xmath50 . for low tip temperatures",
    "the coulomb staircase makes a fit meaningless .",
    "the dependence on @xmath4 is weak .",
    "nevertheless , it is astonishing that @xmath49 decreases with increasing @xmath51 and increasing @xmath5 .",
    "an rigorous treatment of the dependence of the ( theoretical ) environment temperature on the ( real ) base and tip temperature requires further investigation .",
    "in a theoretical treatment we have shown that the crossover between double - junction behavior and single - junction behavior in an stm setup can be monitored by a single parameter , the tip temperature of the stm .",
    "the tip junction works as an ohmic environment resistance for the hot tip .",
    "even if the temperature on both sides of this junction is very different , its behavior can be described by an environment temperature alone .",
