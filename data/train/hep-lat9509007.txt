    "understanding the mechanism of quark confinement is a central problem in the high energy physics . according to a model conjectured long time ago by g.",
    "t  hooft  @xcite and s.  mandelstam  @xcite the confining vacuum behaves as a coherent state of color magnetic monopoles , or , equivalently , the vacuum resembles a magnetic ( dual ) superconductor .    up to now",
    "there is some some numerical evidence in favour of this model  @xcite .",
    "there are also efforts  @xcite towards the detection of monopoles condensation in the vacuum .",
    "we analyzed the distribution of the color fields due to static q@xmath0 pair in su(2 ) lattice gauge theory , moreover we studied the gauge dependence of the london penetration length by working both without gauge fixing and in the maximally abelian gauge  @xcite .",
    "the full details of this work can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite    we performed monte carlo simulation using the overrelaxed metropolis algorithm in the range @xmath1 on lattices of sizes @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 . after a number of thermalization sweeps",
    "@xmath5 we collect 1 measurement every 100 upgrades in the case of su(2 ) without gauge fixing , for a total amount of 100 measurements . in order to reduce the quantum fluctuations we cooled the lattice configurations .",
    "this way quantum fluctuations are reduced by a few order of magnitude , while the relevant physical observables survives and show a plateau vs. cooling steps . in the case of maximally abelian projected su(2 ) we took 1 measurement every 50 upgrades for a total amount of 700 measurements . remarkably in this case",
    "no cooling is needed to get a good signal / noise ratio .",
    "we handled statistical errors with jackknife algorithm modified to take into account correlations .",
    "we can measure the color fields by means of the correlation @xmath6 of a plaquette @xmath7 with a wilson loop @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the plaquette is connected to the wilson loop by a schwinger line l  ( see fig.[fig : correlator ] ) : @xmath9    the chromoelectromagnetic field strength tensor is defined as @xmath10      in the t  hooft formulation the dual superconductor model is elaborated through the abelian projection . to perform the abelian projection on the lattice we fix the gauge by diagonalizing an operator @xmath11 which transforms according to the adjoint representation and",

    "the abelian field strength tensor is @xmath16 with @xmath17 we perform the abelian projection in the maximally abelian gauge ( in the continuum : @xmath18 ) . on the lattice",
    "the gauge is fixed by maximizing ( over all su(2 ) gauge transformations @xmath19 ) the lattice functional @xmath20 \\,.\\ ] ] this is equivalent to diagonalize ( @xmath21 su(2 ) algebra ) : @xmath22 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] gauge fixing is performed by an iterative overrelaxed algorithm  @xcite . once we found the su(2 ) matrix @xmath19 which locally maximizes @xmath23 , we keep @xmath24 where the @xmath25 parameter has to be properly tuned to increase the efficacy of the gauge fixing  ( fig .  [",
    "fig : overrelaxation ] ) . to establish a convergence criterion for the iterative gauge fixing we consider the average size of the non - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath26 , eq.([x ] ) , over the whole lattice : @xmath27\\ ] ] where @xmath28 .",
    "the optimal overrelaxation parameter agrees with the one relevant to the landau gauge fixing  @xcite:@xmath29      in both cases of su(2 ) without gauge fixing and su(2 ) in the maximally abelian gauge we obtained that ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fmunu ] for the case of su(2 ) without gauge fixing ) the longitudinal chromoelectric field @xmath30 is sizeable ( the other field strength components are a few order of magnitude smaller ) . furthermore @xmath31 is almost constant along the @xmath32 flux tube and decreases fast along the direction transverse to the flux tube .",
    "if the dual superconductor scenario holds , the transverse shape of the longitudinal chromoelectric field @xmath31 should resemble the dual version of the abrikosov vortex field distribution .",
    "hence we expect that @xmath33 can be fitted according to @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the modified bessel function of order zero , @xmath36 is the external flux , and @xmath37 is the london penetration length .",
    "we try the fit outside the coherence region @xmath38 , @xmath39 being the coherence length , i.e. @xmath39 measures the coherence of the magnetic monopole condensate .",
    "we fit our data for @xmath40 obtaining @xmath41 and check the stability of the fit parameters @xmath42 and @xmath36 by fitting the data with the cuts @xmath43 .",
    "since in the case of su(2 ) without gauge fixing we adopted a cooling procedure , we verified  @xcite the stability of the fit parameter @xmath42 versus the number of cooling steps .",
    "we found that the london penetration length extracted from the gauge invariant correlator @xmath6 @xmath44 agrees with the one extracted from the abelian projected correlator @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mu_vs_beta_ab - nonab ] ) @xmath46",
    "we have shown that the longitudinal chromoelectric field @xmath31 is almost constant along the flux tube ( i.e. the long distance potential which feel the color charges is linear ) .",
    "we have also ascertained that the longitudinal chromoelectric field @xmath31 is the only sizeable component of the field strength tensor , and its transverse distribution @xmath33 can be fitted by eq .",
    "(  [ london ] ) .",
    "since the string tension is given by the energy stored into the flux tube per unit length , using the above results and extrapolating the @xmath35-distribution up to @xmath47 ( with negligible error if @xmath48 ) , we get the simple relation between the string tension and the penetration length : @xmath49 the main uncertainty comes out from the fit parameter @xmath36 .",
    "however we observe that in the maximally abelian projection @xmath50 , and @xmath51 when @xmath52 .",
    "we feel that the external flux @xmath36 is strongly affected by lattice artifacts which , however , are strongly reduced in the maximally abelian projection .",
    "we can try to get rid of these effects by assuming that in the limit @xmath53 : @xmath54 . this way we get : @xmath55    fitting all together the data to a constant we get ( purely statistic error ) @xmath56",
    "our extimation of the string tension is consistent with the linear asymptotic extrapolation of the string tension data extracted from wilson loops on lattices larger than ours  @xcite @xmath57 moreover note that , due to @xmath58 , we have @xmath59",
    "we found evidence that the su(2 ) vacuum behaves like a dual superconductor .",
    "in particular , we verified that the flux tube color field is composed by the chromoelectric component parallel to the line joining the static charges .",
    "this longitudinal chromoelectric field is almost constant far from the color sources and decreases rapidly in the direction transverse to the flux tube .",
    "the transverse distribution of the longitudinal chromoelectric field behaves according to the dual london equation  eq .",
    "( [ london ] ) . the london penetration length extracted from the monte carlo data using eq .",
    "( [ london ] ) is a physical quantity @xmath60 . so that the long range properties of the su(2 ) confining vacuum can be described by an effective abelian theory .",
    "moreover we established a simple relation between the string tension and the penetration length which gives an extimate of @xmath61 close to the extrapolated continuum limit available in the literature .",
