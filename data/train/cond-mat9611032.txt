    "however , in the vicinity of the low - to - high - spin transition , the homogeneous phase is unstable against phase separation . as a consequence there exists a surface @xmath134 in the space of @xmath135 which divides the homogeneous from the separated region ( see fig . [ f3 ] ) . at any point @xmath136 with @xmath137 ( or @xmath138 ,",
    "the system breaks up into one part with density @xmath139 and another one with @xmath140 .",
    "it is an open question , however , whether the phase separation is an artefact of hubbard - type models , because of , e.g. , the neglect of long range coulomb interaction .",
    "the first order behavior of the mi transition for @xmath99 is caused by the competition of two different energy minima , now possible due to of the much larger space of variational parameters .",
    "we expect that the first order nature will survive when we include antiferromagnetic states in the minimization .",
    "first order , low - to - high spin transitions are also observed for two - band , itinerant ferromagnetic states .",
    "@xcite in fact , we suspect that first order changes in the electronic structure of incomplete 3d shells may drive many phase transitions of magnetic 3d compounds .",
    "it should be interesting to reexamine the mi phase transitions observed e.g. for @xmath141 or @xmath142@xcite with respect to their first order behavior .",

    "nevertheless , their more general remark that the nature of the mott transition is not qualitatively changed by orbital degeneracy is not supported by our results , concerning the cases @xmath146 .",
    "in conclusion , we have extended the gutzwiller method to arbitrary numbers @xmath147 of correlated orbitals per site and have reported studies on the simplest @xmath1 model .",
    "we find a wealth of new features , not present in the @xmath148 models , such as first order metal - insulator transitions or low - to - high spin transitions .",
