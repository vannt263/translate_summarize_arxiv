    "g359.230.82 ( `` the mouse '' ) , with its long axisymmetric nonthermal nebula extending for 12  arcminutes , was first discovered as part of a very large array ( vla ) radio continuum survey of the galactic center at 20 cm ( yusef - zadeh and bally 1987 ) . a bow - shock structure was noted along the eastern edge of the nebula ( yusef - zadeh and bally 1989 ) .",
    "in addition , radio continuum data show linearly polarized emission from the full extent of the nebula and the spectral index distribution between 2 , 6 and 20 cm remains flat at the head of the nebula but steepens in the direction away from the head of the mouse ( yusef - zadeh and bally 1989 ) .",
    "the detection of x - ray emission from this source and the identification of a young radio pulsar g359.230.82 at the head of the nebula resulted in a breakthrough in our understanding of what powers this source ( predehl and kulkarni 1995 ; sidoli et al . 1999 ; camilo et al .",
    "more recently , _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations show detailed structural and spectral characteristics of this bow - shock pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) associated with the mouse ( gaensler et al .",
    "modeling of the x - ray emission suggests a high space velocity @xmath0600 km  s@xmath1 in a relatively warm phase of the ism in order to explain the cometary morphology of this source .",
    "the region where the mouse is found contains a number of other nonthermal radio continuum sources .",
    "figure  1 shows a large - scale 20 cm view of this region where two shell - type supernova remnants ( snrs ) g359.10.5 and g359.10.2 , and a southern segment of a nonthermal radio filament g359.10.2 , known as the `` snake '' , are distributed ( reich & frst 1984 ; gray et al .",
    "1991 ; yusef - zadeh , hewitt and cotton 2004 ) .",
    "the shell - like snr g359.1 - 0.5 has a diameter of about 20@xmath2 and the extension of the tail of the mouse appears to be pointed toward the center of this remnant . here , we present high - resolution radio images showing new structural details of the mouse . using polarization data , we present the distribution of the magnetic field and the rotation measure of the bow - shock region of the nebula .",
    "we also argue that the mouse and snr  g359.10.5 are potentially associated with each other .",
    "using the vla in its bna array configuration , we reduced the archival data taken in 1999  october at 3.6 cm wavelength .",
    "standard calibrations were carried out using 3c  286 and iers  b1741312 as amplitude and phase calibrators , respectively .",
    "we also calibrated and combined the 6 and 2 cm data taken in 1987  november and 1988  february in the bna and cnb array configurations , respectively .",
    "3c  286 and nrao  530 were selected as the phase and amplitude calibrators for the 6 and 2 cm data . using different robust weighting to the _ uv _ data ,",
    "the final images were constructed after phase self - calibration was applied to all 6 , 3.6 cm and 2 cm data .",
    "the spectral index distribution of the mouse based on these measurements will be given elsewhere .",
    "we believe that the scale lengths of the features that are described here are well - sampled in the @xmath3 plane . in particular , the best well - sampled baselines range between 10 and 550 k@xmath4 at 3.6 cm and and 5 and 250 k@xmath4 at 6 cm , respectively .",
    "figures 2a , b shows the combined polarized and total intensity images of the mouse with a resolution of 2.1@xmath5 ( pa  @xmath6 ) at 6 cm .",
    "the total intensity image of the head of the mouse shows a cone - shape structure within which a bright linear feature with an extent of @xmath7 appears to run along the axis of the symmetry . with the exception of depolarizing features , which are displayed as dark patches in figure 2a ,",
    "similar morphology is seen in both the total and polarized intensity images .",
    "the overall degree of polarization at 6 cm ranges between 10 and 25% .",
    "detailed 6 cm images of the head of the nebula show that the peak polarized and total intensity images are offset from each other suggesting that the emission is depolarized at the outermost portion of the bow shock .",
    "this offset is best shown in figure 3a , b where a slice is cut along the axis of the symmetry of the distribution of the polarized and total intensity , respectively . a sharp rise in the total intensity of the emission having a 67% degree of polarization",
    "is followed by a peak emission which coincides with a drop in the polarized emission ; the degree of polarized emission is less than 1% at this position . in the region where the total intensity falls gradually",
    ", the degree of the polarization rises to values ranging between 510% .",
    "it is clear that either the magnetic field is highly tangled - up or that there is a high degree of thermal plasma mixed in with nonthermal gas at the head of the nebula where no polarized emission is detected .",
    "a more dramatic picture of this depolarization feature at 3.6 cm is shown in figure 6a , as discussed below .",
    "figure 4a , b show grayscale and contour images of the head of the mouse immediately to the west of the bright bowshock .",
    "the bright compact source that is suspected to be coincident with the pulsar is clearly resolved in these images .",
    "the sharp distribution of the emission ahead of the pulsar when compared with a more gradual distribution of emission behind the pulsar supports for the compression of gas and magnetic field in the bowshock region resulting from the supersonic motion of the pulsar .",
    "we note a 4@xmath8hole@xmath9 in the 3.6 cm brightness distribution within which the emission is three times fainter than the features surrounding it .",
    "the center of the  hole@xmath9 lies near @xmath10 .",
    "the non - uniform distribution of emission behind the bow - shock can be seen throughout the mouse at 6 and 3.6 cm .",
    "additional 2 and 6 cm images presented in figures 5a , b also support the evidence for the modulation of the total intensity along the axis of the symmetry .",
    "the morphology of the emission is complicated but figures 2  5 show that the overall brightness temperature along the axis of the symmetry decreases at about 5@xmath11 and 45@xmath12 west of the bowshock .    the grayscale distribution of the polarized emission superimposed on contours of total intensity at 6 and 3.6 cm are shown in figures 6a , b , respectively .",
    "the length and the position angle of the line segments represent the distributions of the polarized emission and the polarization vectors rotated by 90 degrees .",
    "the distribution of the polarization vectors at these wavelengths , including our 2 cm data that are not shown here , are similar to each other .",
    "the striking feature in these images is the recognition of a depolarizing feature separating the distribution of the polarized emission in the bowshock region from the region behind the pulsar .",
    "the position angle of the polarization angle vectors changes by 90@xmath13 between these two regions .",
    "the slice representations of the total and polarized intensity at 6 cm , as shown in figure 3a , b , are consistent with a picture that the scale of the magnetic field within the beam must have changed in order to produce the depolarizing feature . the distributions of the polarization vectors at 3.6 and 6 cm are used to determine the rotation measure ( rm ) distribution of the polarized emission ahead of the mouse .",
    "figure 7a , b show slice representations of the distribution of the rm and its error between 3.6 and 6 cm cut along the symmetry axis of the mouse . the rm value is on order of 500@xmath1440 rad m@xmath15 near the bow shock to 400@xmath1420 rad  m@xmath15 at the position of the depolarizing feature before it increases to a value 0@xmath1460  rad  m@xmath15 away from the bow shock .",
    "the low value of the rm and its error in the region behind the pulsar suggests the intrinsic magnetic field traces the direction of the inferred motion .",
    "we believe that the faraday rotation toward the mouse due to interstellar material along the line of sight is well represented in the rm distribution behind the pulsar and along the tail of the mouse .",
    "however , the high rm values as well as the evidence in field reversal and the low degree of polarization ahead of the pulsar are distinctly different than the region behind the pulsar . these effects , in particular , the increase in rm toward the head of the mouse by two orders of magnitude imply that faraday rotation along the line of sight can not explain the unusual characteristics of polarization ahead of the pulsar .",
    "we suggest a picture in which there is a mixture of thermal and nonthermal plasma coexisting in the bowshock region .",
    "although , it is expected that the magnetic field gets compressed and becomes more uniform in the bowshock region of a pulsar wind nebula , internal thermal plasma can produce a high degree of faraday rotation and depolarization ( burn 1966 ) .",
    "future detailed polarization observations using multiple bands in order to determine the true distribution of faraday rotation should be able to test this interpretation .    using the dispersion measure of @xmath0100 @xmath16 pc ( camilo et al .",
    "2002 ) and an upper limit of rm@xmath0 100 rad m@xmath15 , the parallel component of the magnetic field along the line of sight is estimated to be @xmath17 g .",
    "this unusually low value of the magnetic field along the line of sight is likely to be underestimated since the sign of the rm could change between the head and the tail of the mouse .",
    "the fluctuation of electron density and magnetic field of a turbulent medium along the line of sight , as well as from the region within the nebula , can severely affect the correct estimate of the magnetic field along the line of sight ( beck et al .",
    "2003 ) . in spite of this difficulty ,",
    "the rm estimate made here is at least an order of magnitude less than the estimate made toward objects lying within a few hundred pcs of the galactic center ( e.g. , yusef - zadeh , wardle and parastaran 1997 ) .",
    "the rm value estimated from this study is consistent with a source lying less than 5 kpc from us .",
    "one of the most puzzling aspects of radio observations reported here is the distribution of synchrotron emission near the apex of the pulsar wind where the intensity is modulated at 3 cm .",
    "the drop in synchrotron emissivity may be accounted for in terms of the unshocked wind arising from the pulsar or an inhomogeneous distribution of synchrotron emission .",
    "the numerical simulations carried out by gaensler et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have in fact predicted a closed elongated structure associated with the termination shock behind a supersonically moving pulsar .",
    "a more detailed comparison of radio and x - ray data is needed to determine the nature of the intensity distribution and how it may be related to the termination shock behind the pulsar .",
    "radio and x - ray observations suggest the the mouse could lie at distance ranging between 2 and 5 kpc and that this object is not associated with snr g359.10.5 .",
    "uchida et al . ( 1992 ) considered that g359.10.5 is associated with a molecular ring lying near the galactic center requiring multiple supernova explosions to account for an energy of 6@xmath18 ergs .",
    "however , a subsequent detection of maser emission at 5  km  s@xmath1 surrounding this large - scale source ( yusef - zadeh et al . 1995 ) , as well as the detection of low value of rotation measure toward the remnant ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) , suggest that snr g359.10.5 is unlikely to be located within a few parsec of the galactic center at the distance of 8.5 kpc .",
    "one possibility is that the mouse and snr g359.10.5 are associated with each other .",
    "the support for this suggestion may come from the absorption column measured ranging between @xmath19  cm@xmath15 and @xmath21  cm@xmath15 toward the remnant ( bamba et al .",
    "2000 ; egger and sun 1998 ) and @xmath22  cm@xmath15 toward the mouse ( gaensler et al .",
    "depending on how one fits the x - ray spectrum , these estimates could be consistent with each other .",
    "if snr g359.10.5 and the mouse lie at the distance of 5 kpc , the time that it takes for the pulsar to travel 34 pc , the distance between the center of the remnant and the pulsar , is @xmath23 years .",
    "this is more than twice the characteristic age of the pulsar @xmath24  yr .",
    "recent studies suggest that the true age of young pulsars can be longer than their characteristic age , so it is possible that the mouse and snr g359.10.5 could have the same origin .    in conclusion , we have presented new high - resolution radio continuum images of the mouse , showing a modulation of the intensity behind the pulsar . a polarization image of the mouse at 3.6 cm shows that the overall distribution of the inferred magnetic field is parallel to the axis of symmetry away from the bow shock .",
    "however , a high degree of depolarization , field reversal and high rm are detected ahead of the pulsar near the interface where the polarization angle changes by @xmath25 .",
    "these images indicate that the direction of the magnetic field in the bow shock is likely to be tangent to the shock normal , though more detailed radio observations are required to correct for faraday effects .",
    "we have also argued that the mouse and an adjacent snr g359.10.5 , may be associated .",
    "future radio and x - ray observations should be able to shed light on the nature of the mouse and snr g359.10.5 as well as their physical relationship .",
