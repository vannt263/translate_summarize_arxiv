    "meson assisted dibaryons are three - body systems consisting of two unbound baryons plus a @xmath4-wave pion @xcite . for strangeness @xmath14 , a prototype @xmath15 @xmath16 quasibound state ( @xmath17  hyperon ) , driven by the @xmath4-wave resonances @xmath18 and @xmath19 , was studied recently @xcite . replacing a baryon in this system by a meson ,",
    "one obtains a two - meson assisted baryon . for example , staying within @xmath14 and substituting @xmath20 meson for hyperon @xmath21 , or @xmath22 meson for nucleon @xmath23 , a coupled channel @xmath0@xmath24 two - meson assisted baryon resonance is obtained . in the present paper",
    "we study this three body system by solving coupled channel , kinematically relativistic faddeev equations . considering the three - body @xmath0 channel ,",
    "its @xmath2 subsystem is dominated by the @xmath25 channel in which the @xmath26 coupled channel @xmath1-wave interaction is already sufficiently strong to bind , resulting in the @xmath1-wave @xmath27(1405 ) resonance .",
    "the @xmath5 subsystem is dominated by the @xmath28 channel , resulting in the @xmath4-wave @xmath18 resonance , and the @xmath29 subsystem is dominated by the @xmath30 channel , resulting in the @xmath31 resonance . in addition , since the @xmath32 coupling connects @xmath0 to @xmath33 , one must also consider the @xmath3 subsystem in the @xmath34 channel , resulting in the @xmath4-wave @xmath19 resonance , and the @xmath35 subsystem in the @xmath36 channel , resulting in the @xmath4-wave @xmath37 resonance .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the only three - body configuration in which these subsystem quantum number specifications can be accommodated is @xmath9 .",
    "the value of spin @xmath38 is maximal for a @xmath4-wave pion and @xmath1-wave nucleon and @xmath20 meson , thus ensuring that each one of the two - body channels has precisely the spin at which it resonates .",
    "the value of isospin @xmath39 is not maximal , which means that nonresonating two - body channels will also contribute to the binding energy balance of @xmath9 @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding interactions are disregarded with respect to those in the resonating channels in this exploratory calculation .",
    "other allowed values of isospin , @xmath40 , stand no chance of producing three - body binding because only one of the three possible two - body resonating channels can contribute to the @xmath40 @xmath0 states .",
    "thus , the choice @xmath9 is unique in searching for quasibound configurations of @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath0 threshold around 1570 mev is within a close reach of the one - star @xmath9 @xmath41 ` exotic ' resonance @xcite .",
    "this apparent connection is discussed towards the conclusion of the present paper .",
    "other studies of two - meson assisted baryonic resonances focused entirely on @xmath1-wave two - body interactions , for nonstrange resonances @xcite as well as for strangeness @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath42 @xcite . for @xmath14 , in particular , the @xmath43 @xmath0 configurations were studied , with @xmath27 and @xmath12 resonance candidates in the mass range @xmath44 gev .",
    "it is remarkable that with meson - baryon @xmath4-wave interactions , as studied here , a lower mass value can be reached which , furthermore , corresponds to a quasibound state rather than resonance . finally , we mention the @xmath45 faddeev calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite , again with @xmath1-wave two - body interactions , searching for a @xmath46 exotic @xmath47 @xmath48 pentaquark .",
    "we have verified by solving the appropriate faddeev equations with a @xmath4-wave pion that no @xmath49 @xmath45 quasibound state candidate exists in the relevant energy range for a @xmath47 @xmath48 pentaquark .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sepint ] we construct two - body separable interactions for the resonating channels discussed above .",
    "the corresponding @xmath50 matrices serve as input to the set of three - body coupled faddeev equations which are constructed in sec .",
    "[ sec : fad ] .",
    "we employ a straightforward generalization of the nonrelativistic faddeev equations , incorporating relativistic kinematics to account in a minimal way for the light pion in the @xmath0@xmath33 coupled three - body systems . solving these faddeev equations",
    "we find a @xmath0 quasibound pole which is listed for several allowed parametrizations of the @xmath3 two - body data and is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] .",
    "our calculations , suggesting a @xmath11 @xmath12 resonance near the @xmath0 threshold ( @xmath13 mev ) , are summarized in the last sec .",
    "[ sec : summ ] .",
    "data available on the @xmath2@xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath29 , and @xmath35 subsystems were fitted with rank - one energy independent separable potentials , as detailed below . while the @xmath4-wave subsystems in the mass range considered in this work are dominated each by a single resonance pole with no other nearby threshold to introduce additional significant energy dependence",
    ", this may not hold for the @xmath1-wave @xmath2@xmath3 subsystem where energy dependence affects the number and position of poles ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) . however , energy dependent potentials are known to cause problems in relativistically formulated three - body calculations @xcite .",
    "we further remark on energy dependence in subsection [ sec : inmedium ] . for a standard classification of the two - body subsystems ,",
    "we denote @xmath20 as particle 1 , @xmath23 as particle 2 , @xmath22 as particle 3 , and label the two - body @xmath50-matrices by the spectator particle .",
    "thus , @xmath51 is the @xmath5 @xmath50-matrix , @xmath52 is the @xmath53 @xmath50-matrix , and @xmath54 is the @xmath2 @xmath50-matrix .",
    "in addition , we introduce @xmath55 as the @xmath35 @xmath50-matrix .",
    "the @xmath2 interaction allows particle conversion to @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "there are two resonating two - body channels that contribute to the @xmath9 three - body state .",
    "one is the @xmath25 channel which results in the @xmath1-wave @xmath27(1405 ) resonance and the other one is the @xmath34 channel , resulting in the @xmath4-wave @xmath19 resonance .",
    "we use the lippmann - schwinger equation with relativistic kinematics @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the invariant mass of the two - body subsystem and @xmath61 using the separable interaction @xmath62 the solution of eq .",

    "@xmath66 @xmath1-wave resonance , the @xmath67 @xmath58 channel is excluded by isospin conservation , so that only the channels @xmath2 and @xmath57 contribute .",
    "the corresponding form factors were parametrized by yamaguchi forms : @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that a single - channel energy independent separable potential of the form ( [ eq3 ] ) does not generate @xmath1-wave resonances , which becomes possible upon including a second channel .",

    "this partial width excludes contributions from channels disregarded in the present @xmath0@xmath33 three - body model .",
    "the total width @xmath85 includes also a partial width @xmath86 induced by meson absorption modes into two - body @xmath87 and @xmath3 final states which were disregarded in this exploratory calculation and could amount to several tens of mev .",
    "in this work we have derived three - body faddeev equations for the @xmath0@xmath33 coupled channels , with isobar model separable @xmath4-wave interactions for the two - body @xmath5 ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath7 ( @xmath88 ) , @xmath3 ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath6 ( @xmath37 ) subsystems , and separable @xmath1-wave coupled channel interactions for the two - body @xmath2@xmath3 subsystem dominated by the @xmath66 resonance .",

    "all the resonating two - body subsystems used for input in the coupled channels faddeev calculation were found indispensable to obtain a quasibound solution near the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "the uncertainty of this calculation is determined by the lack of a reliable @xmath4-wave phase shift parametrization for the @xmath89 decay spectrum . requiring a ` size ' of the @xmath3 form factor similar to that for @xmath5 , a @xmath0 resonance or quasibound state exists with mass @xmath90 mev and decay width which is bounded from below by @xmath91 mev . with respect to two - body @xmath87 and @xmath3 final states , which are outside the scope of the present three - body model ,",
