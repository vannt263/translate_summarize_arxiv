    "thin magnetic films with stripe domains and perpendicular magneto - crystalline anisotropy present a high scientific interest .",
    "they are model systems to understand the domain structure of ferromagnetic , as well as ferroelectric , thin films .",
    "such materials are used for the fabrication of memories and spin injection devices . considering a thin film with its bulk easy axis perpendicular to the surface , the magnetization direction in the domains can depend on the film thickness .",
    "thick films behave as bulk material but for thin films , the competition between exchange , magnetostatic and magneto - crystalline energy can tip up the magnetization into the plane .",
    "a very well known theory of magnetic domain structure has been developed by  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the film magnetization is described by a square profile .",
    "domain wall energy is allowed for the energy balance , but not for the magnetization profile , which determines the magnetostatic energy .",
    "such an approximation is only valid when the domain width is much larger than the width of domain walls .",
    "therefore , this model is bound to fail for very thin films , where the domain width vanishes .",
    "furthermore , the magnetostatic interaction between the top and bottom surfaces is disregarded , which leads to wrong results unless the domain width is much less than the film thickness .",
    "the latter does not hold for very thin strongly anisotropic films .    within the kittel model ,",
    "the width of stripe domains is proportional to the square root of the film thickness .",
    "the model also predicts the existence of a critical film thickness below which the magnetization direction flips from out - of - plane to in - plane direction .",
    "later on , it was shown that for materials with strong magneto - crystalline anisotropy @xmath0 ( in comparison to the square of the saturation magnetization @xmath1 ) the magnetostatic interaction energy between top and bottom interface can not be neglected .",
    "the ratio @xmath2 ( in si units ) is also known as the quality factor @xmath3 and the magnetization direction remains perpendicular to the surface for all values of film thickness for @xmath4 .",
    "numerous theoretical and experimental works have been devoted to such materials with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in such materials the domain width has a minimum as a function of film thickness , increasing towards smaller or larger thicknesses .",
    "materials with strong perpendicular anisotropy are also of technological importance in the field of magnetic multilayers ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    just above the critical film thickness , the magnetization still lies predominantly in the plane of the film , deviations from the homogeneous in - plane orientation being very small .",
    "this permits an exact mathematical solution of the problem of stripe domain nucleation at the critical point @xcite .",
    "near the critical point the out - of - plane component of the magnetization remains much smaller than the saturation value @xmath1 and there is a strong variation of the magnetization direction across the film thickness . the corresponding phase is usually called the weak stripe phase",
    ". as the film thickness increases , the magnetization direction in the domains tends more and more towards the bulk easy axis , which is perpendicular to the film .",
    "gradually , the weak stripe phase evolves towards the strong stripe phase , where the magnetization magnetization is predominantly parallel ( or antiparallel ) to the bulk easy axis .    for a detailed analysis of the weak stripe phase a micromagnetic numerical analysis is indispensable ( see @xcite and many other works ) . however , simple analytical models are helpful for getting a quick , albeit crude understanding of the stripe phases .",
    "these models restrict the magnetization direction to the vertical plane parallel to the stripes ( i.e. they consider domain walls of bloch type ) but improve the kittel model .",
    "one can distinguish between models with a linear domain wall profile  @xcite or others which use the jacobi sine function to parametrize the magnetization profile  @xcite . also a sinewave magnetization profile was proposed by saito @xcite to treat the weak stripe phase in an approximate manner . in the following we present a thorough analytical and numerical analysis of a simple but quite complete model for the strong stripe phase .",
    "we adopt a sinewave magnetization profile in the wall and we take into account the magnetostatic interaction between the top and bottom surfaces of the film . our model applies to hexagonal co , for which a critical thickness between 25 nm @xcite and 40 nm @xcite has been reported , as well as to materials with high magneto - crystalline anisotropy , such as fepd(001 ) or garnet films @xcite .",
    "another possible application concerns ferromagnetic thin films of mn@xmath5ge@xmath6 that were recently synthesized @xcite .",
    "our model unifies previous results for materials with strong anisotropy ( @xmath4 ) @xcite and those with medium anisotropy ( @xmath7 ) @xcite , containing them as special cases .",
    "the explicit treatment of the domain wall is an important improvement with respect to the kittel model since it allows the determination of the in - plane remanent magnetization , which is important for the analysis of experimental data .",
    "we give numerical results for the dependence of domain and wall widths on the film thickness and calculate the critical thickness at which the magnetization switches from out - of - plane to in - plane direction if @xmath8 .",
    "we show that the critical thickness tends to zero as @xmath9 .",
    "this behavior is identical in our model and in the exact solution @xcite . in the case of strong anisotropy ( @xmath4 )",
    "stripe magnetic domains exist at any film thickness .",
    "our theory considers a non - magnetistrictive film : the magneto - elastic energy is equal to zero .",
    "moreover , the surface anisotropy is neglected .",
    "it is not suited for materials where the surface anisotropy plays an important role .",
    "we concentrate on the strong stripe phase since the details of the weak stripe phase are hard to capture in a simple model . in materials with high",
    "the weak stripe phase does not appear at all and it will be shown below that even in materials with medium anisotropy ( @xmath7 ) it is of rather limited importance . in the latter case",
    "the weak stripe phase occurs only in a narrow interval of thicknesses around the critical point .",
    "this region of the weak stripe phase is not correctly described in our model . on the other hand , even in the case of weak anisotropy ( @xmath10 )",
    ", our model provides a correct qualitative description of the strong stripe phase , although it neglects such important phenomena as closure domains .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . after a short summary of known results ( s theory , sawtooth magnetization model , exact results for stripe phase nucleation ) we present our model in section  3 . in section  4",
    "we show its analytical and numerical solution .",
    "the usefulness of our theory is demonstrated in section  5 by way of theoretical analysis of published experimental data for the well - known _ hcp _ cobalt system . in section  6",
    "we compare our model with other approaches and expose its strengths and limitations .",
    "this model was developed for ferromagnetic films with uniaxial anisotropy perpendicular to the film .",
    "it determines the width of magnetic stripe domains @xmath11 as a function of the film thickness @xmath12 , and the critical thickness where the magnetization direction flips from out - of - plane to in - plane ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : kittel ] ) .        the total energy density ( per unit volume )",
    "is given by : @xmath13 where @xmath1 denotes the saturation magnetization and @xmath14 the surface wall energy .",
    "the latter is obtained in a separate variational calculation for an isolated bloch wall @xcite , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the exchange stiffness constant .",
    "the same calculation yields the wall width , @xmath17 .",
    "it is convenient to express all spatial dimensions in the units of @xmath18 :    @xmath19    thus , kittel s reduced wall width is a constant ,    @xmath20    the only essential material parameter in the model is the dimensionless quality ratio , @xmath21 . the first term of eq .",
    "( [ ek ] ) refers to the magnetostatic energy of a rectangular domain profile , neglecting the influences of finite wall width and film thickness .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , the model is only applicable when the following strong inequalities hold : @xmath22 or alternatively , @xmath23 .",
    "the right - hand condition ensures the negligibility of the magnetostatic interaction between the top and the bottom surfaces of the film . by minimizing the energy ,",
    "one obtains the equilibrium domain width : @xmath24 and the minimum energy density : @xmath25 as one can see , the minimum energy density @xmath26 tends to infinity as @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the multi - domain structure can not be stable in that limit within the kittel model .",
    "indeed , for a uniform in - plane magnetization ( perpendicular to the bulk easy axis ) , the magnetostatic and the exchange energies are equal to zero , and the anisotropy energy is maximal and equal to @xmath0 .",
    "the critical point is obtained by equating eq .",
    "( [ ev ] ) to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we can express the reduced critical thickness as follows :    @xmath28    within the kittel model , the domain width is identical to the half - period @xmath11 ( see fig.[fig : kittel ] ) .",
    "its value at the critical point is obtained by setting eq .",
    "( [ ec ] ) into  ( [ dopt ] ) , which results in :    @xmath29    these equations permit to obtain a qualitative evaluation of the critical quantities .",
    "but they fail in the neighborhood of the critical thickness , where domain and wall widths become close , cf .",
    "( [ deltak ] ) and ( [ dc ] ) .",
    "furthermore , by eqs .",
    "( [ ec ] ) and ( [ dc ] ) in the critical region the ratio @xmath30 equals @xmath31 , i.e. also the second precondition of the kittel model ( [ strong ] ) is violated in the case of large anisotropy or small magnetization , @xmath32 . as a result",
    ", kittel s model makes a wrong prediction for large @xmath3 : according to eq .",
    "( [ ec ] ) , @xmath33 decreases asymptotically , remaining nonzero at any finite @xmath3 . in actual fact , the critical thickness should vanish at @xmath34 , as shown by rigorous calculations @xcite .",
    "for that reason we decided to develop a model that would not break down in the strong - anisotropy case , by allowing for the electrostatic interaction between the top and bottom surfaces of the film and taking into account the wall width explicitly . within that improved model",
    "we have obtained a good description of domain and wall width variation as a function of the film thickness ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the main goal of kittel s model is the description of the strong stripe phase .",
    "yet there is no direct transition between strong stripes and planar magnetization .",
    "rather , it proceeds via an intermediate weak stripe configuration .",
    "the latter can be described by sawtooth magnetization model @xcite . in this model",
    "the canting angle of the magnetization out of the homogeneous in - plane direction , @xmath35 , is assumed to be a saw - tooth curve with a maximum value of @xmath36 and a minimum value of @xmath37 , @xmath38 . between the extrema",
    "the variation is linear and the half period is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the sawtooth magnetization model is an approximate one , since it neglects the variation of the magnetization direction across the film thickness .",
    "the magnetostatic interaction between the top and bottom surfaces is not taken into account either . from the equation for",

    "there is an instability and the weak stripe phase emerges . in the neighbourhood of the critical point ,",

    "the numerical results obtained for different quality factors @xmath3 show the evolution of domain and wall widths as functions of film thickness .    with the new model we are able to correctly describe the behavior of magnetic domains in cobalt thin films .",
    "it allows to explain the experimental observations of brandenburg _ et al _ @xcite with more realistic fitting parameters than using the kittel model . by comparing the exact critical thickness for stripe nucleation @xmath47 with our critical thickness @xmath83 , which corresponds to the on - set of strong stripes , we are able to estimate the range of thicknesses where weak stripes are expected .",
    "we show that for co this interval is rather narrow , 10 to 15 nm , which validates our model .",
    "we should remark that the currently available experimental data for co do not suffice for locating the thickness range of the weak stripe phase accurately .",
    "we find it important that our model takes the wall width into account in an adequate way .",
    "in the neighborhood of the critical thickness , domain and wall width are of comparable size . thanks to its universality",
