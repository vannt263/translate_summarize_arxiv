    "the understanding of matter and its excitations in terms of topology has a long history which is now allowing us an insight into the properties of quantum materials and the opportunity for their manipulation .",
    "topological physics includes the study of kinks , vortices and monopoles in quantum field theory , which forms the basis of a successful branch of condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "a skyrmion @xcite is a topological object which has been shown to exist in a range of magnetic materials at particularly well - defined conditions of temperature and magnetic field .",
    "the simplest example of a skyrmion may be derived from a sphere studded with arrows pointing radially .",
    "a skyrmion is formed if we stereographically project the arrows onto a plane while keeping their orientations fixed .",
    "this produces a twisting pattern which turns out to be a stable knot ; it can not be untied as long as the fields remain smooth and finite .",
    "while skyrmions exist in different forms in a variety of physical systems , the clearest evidence for the existence of the skyrmion is in the spin texture of magnetic systems and in recent years a number of spectacular advances have demonstrated not only the existence of magnetic skyrmions , but also their ordering into a skyrmion lattice ( sl ) @xcite .",
    "there is considerable similarity between the sl , which has recently been shown to be present in a range of non - centrosymmetric , helimagnetic systems , and another topological phase : the vortex lattice ( vl ) found in type ii superconductors in applied magnetic field . like the sl",
    ", the superconducting vl leads to a textured , periodic distribution of magnetic field within the body of the material , which is large on the scale of the crystallographic unit cell . in practice , the same experimental techniques that have been successfully applied to probing vl physics , such as small angle neutron scattering @xcite and , in particular , muon - spin rotation ( @xmath0sr ) @xcite , could potentially be applied to probe the physics of the sl and this hypothesis forms the basis of the work reported here . in this paper",
    "we investigate the extent to which transverse field ( tf ) @xmath0sr measurements are sensitive to the skyrmion phase in the multiferroic skyrmion material cu@xmath1oseo@xmath2 .",
    "our use of tf @xmath0sr to probe the sl in cu@xmath1oseo@xmath2 is analogous to its use in probing the vl in a type ii superconductor , where the technique provides a powerful means of measuring the internal magnetic field distribution caused by the presence of the magnetic field texture @xcite . in a tf @xmath0sr experiment ,",
    "spin polarized muons are implanted in the bulk of a material , in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath4 , which is applied perpendicular to the initial muon spin direction .",
    "muons stop at random positions on the length scale of the field texture where they precess about the total local magnetic field @xmath5 at the muon site ( mainly due to the field texture ) , with frequency @xmath6 , where @xmath7  mhz t@xmath8 .",
    "the observed property of the experiment is the time evolution of the muon spin polarization @xmath9 , which allows the determination of the distribution @xmath10 of local magnetic fields across the sample volume via @xmath11 where the phase @xmath12 results from the detector geometry .    for our measurements powder and single crystal samples of cu@xmath1oseo@xmath2",
    "were synthesized as described previously @xcite , with the same batch of polycrystalline powder also used for the growth of single crystals using the chemical vapour transport technique .",
    "the samples were characterised with powder and single crystal x - ray diffraction which confirmed that the samples were of the requisite b20 phase .",
    "the magnetic response was checked with magnetic susceptibility measurements which confirmed the magnetic transition observed at @xmath13  k.    to establish the existence of skyrmions in our cu@xmath1oseo@xmath2 samples , a sample was prepared for electron microscopy .",
    "single crystal samples showed clear facets and the sample was mechanically polished on a ( 110 ) face until it was 20  @xmath14 m thick .",
    "it was then further thinned by argon ion beam irradiation using a gatan precision ion polishing system ( pips ) initially operated at 4  kv with the ion guns set at @xmath15 to the sample plane .",
    "once the sample thickness approached the wavelength of light , rainbow colours could be observed using an optical microscope and , at this point , the voltage was reduced to 2  kv and the gun angle to @xmath16 and thinning continued until a hole of size 15  @xmath14 m appeared .",
    "images were taken from an area of sample approximately 50  nm thick surrounding this hole with an fei tecnai f20 transmission electron microscope ( tem ) equipped with a field - emission gun using an acceleration voltage of 200  kv . in normal operation",
    ", the objective lens of the microscope applies a 2  t field to the specimen which would force it into its ferrimagnetic state so images were acquired in low - magnification mode in which the image is formed using the diffraction lens and the objective lens was weakly excited to apply a small magnetic field normal to the plane of the specimen .",
    "the sample was cooled using a gatan liquid - helium cooled ` ikhchdt3010-special ' tilt - rotate holder which has a base temperature of 10  k. the images were recorded on a ccd using a gatan imaging filter and they were energy - filtered so that only electrons which had lost between 0 and 1   ev on passing through the specimen contributed to the image .",
    "an aperture was also used to ensure that only the 000-beam and the low - angle scattering from the skyrmions contributed to the image .",
    "the defocus and magnification were calibrated by acquiring images with the same lens settings from agar scientific s ` s106 ' calibration specimen , which consists of lines spaced by 463  nm ruled on an amorphous film .",
    "the defocus was found by taking digital fourier transforms of the images acquired from the calibration specimen and measuring the radii of the dark rings that result from the contrast transfer function as previously described@xcite .",
    "these tem measurements on the thinned crystallites confirm the presence of skyrmion spin textures , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ltem ] .",
    "these occur over an extended region of the phase diagram , compared to results on bulk materials , as observed previously @xcite .",
    "we also note the coexistence of skyrmions and helices , as seen in the previous microscopy study@xcite .",
    "tf @xmath0sr measurements were made using the musr spectrometer at the isis facility and the gps spectrometer at the swiss muon source ( s@xmath14s ) . for measurements at isis",
    "the sample was mounted on a hematite backing plate in order that muons that are implanted in the hematite would be rapidly depolarized and therefore removed from the spectrum .",
    "for measurements at gps the so - called flypast geometry was employed , where the powder sample was suspended on a fork , which prevents those muons that do not implant in the sample from contributing to the signal .",
    "for all measurements presented , the sample was cooled from @xmath17 in the applied field .",
    "all data analysis was carried out using the wimda program @xcite .",
    "the region of the cu@xmath1oseo@xmath2 phase diagram of interest in this study is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq - domain](a ) we note that this is the phase diagram from ref  , which differs slightly from that derived from other studies ( e.g. refs  ) . in this material ,",
    "spins are located on the cu@xmath18 ions , which are arranged in four tetrahedra within the unit cell .",
    "ferrimagnetic ( fim ) ordering of these spins is favoured , with one cu ion ( cu1 ) oriented in the opposite direction to that of the others ( cu2 ) @xcite .",
    "this ordered configuration persists when we build more complicated spin configurations described below @xcite . in systems such as cu@xmath1oseo@xmath2 which lack inversion symmetry ,",
    "chiral interactions are capable of stabilising helically ordered configurations of spins @xcite .",
    "an applied external magnetic field can further stabilise a superposition of three helical configurations in the plane perpendicular to the field ( the configuration is translationally invariant in the remaining direction ) .",
    "the skyrmion spin textures can be formed from a triangular arrangement of the wave vectors of these helices @xcite . from the cu@xmath1oseo@xmath2 phase diagram",
    ", we see that below a lower critical field a phase described as the multi-@xmath19 helimagnetic ( or simply the helimagnetic phase ) exists . in bulk single - crystal samples , this consists of multiple domains of helimagnetic stripes whose @xmath19 vectors are aligned along the three @xmath20 directions @xcite . above this lower critical field but below a second , larger critical field (",
    "above which there is a transition to a ferrimagnetic phase ) , the @xmath19 vector is aligned parallel to the direction of the field , forming a single-@xmath19 helimagnetic phase ( also called the conical phase ) where there are no multiple domains @xcite . in cu@xmath1oseo@xmath2",
    "the a - phase or skyrmion lattice phase ( often denoted skx ) is centered around @xmath21  mt at @xmath13  k , close to the critical temperature @xmath22 where the system undergoes a transition to a paramagnetic state @xcite .",
    "the skx phase may be described by a phase - locked superposition of three helimagnetic textures with @xmath19 vectors perpendicular to the direction of the field , such that a regular lattice of skyrmions is formed .",
    "it has further been shown in a bulk single crystal system that this phase may be further subdivided into two subphases , with the lattice in the second being rotated by thirty degrees with respect to the lattice in the first @xcite .",
    "the range of applied magnetic fields over which the skx phase occurs in cu@xmath1oseo@xmath2 makes it well matched to the isis and the s@xmath14s muon source time windows .",
    "example tf @xmath0sr time - domain spectra measured at s@xmath14s are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : timedomain ] , where the increase in damping upon entering a magnetically ordered phases ( in this case the skyrmion and single @xmath19-phases ) is evident . for our purposes , it is more instructive to consider the frequency domain spectra , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : freq - domain ] and [ fig : comparison ] .",
    "these were obtained via a fast fourier transform of the time - domain spectra , using a lorentzian filter with time constant 2.2  @xmath14s .",
    "[ in these spectra the spectral density is proportional to @xmath10 . ]",
    "we see that spectra in the skyrmion phase are characterized via a relatively narrow , asymmetric spectral density distribution , which rises steeply on the low field side leading to a sharp peak , when compared to spectra within the helical phases .",
    "this peak then decays , first very rapidly and then more gradually with increasing field .",
    "in contrast , the single- and multi-@xmath19 helical phases give rise to less asymmetric distributions with broader maxima and spectral weight distributed over a larger range of fields . in further contrast , the ferrimagnetic phase shows a narrowed , fairly symmetric line ; while the paramagnetic regime is characterized by a very narrow linewidth ( note the change of scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq - domain ] for spectra from these latter two phases ) .",
    "spectra in the single-@xmath19 phase do not show a significant change with temperature below 55  k. however , as we approach temperatures close to the transition to the paramagnetic region [ fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] ] , we see a temperature - driven effect in the single-@xmath19 , multi-@xmath19 and skymion regions , which causes the spectra to show more spectral weight at the applied field , taking on a more heavily peaked appearance . this effect is evident in several spectra [ see e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison](d ) ] , but can be most clearly seen in the single-@xmath19 phase data measured at 50  mt and 56.3  k[fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison](b ) ] when compared to spectra measured at lower temperature in that phase [ fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison](c ) ] , which are quite unresponsive to changes in applied field . however , comparing this latter single-@xmath19 phase spectrum with those measured at the same temperature , but in fields thought to promote the skx phase [ fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison](b ) ] , we see that the spectra may still be distinguished : the skx - phase spectra are more asymmetric , with spectral weight persisting on the high field side of the peak .",
    "we note that in the lorentz tem measurements there is evidence for the coexistence of skyrmions and helical spin textures [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ltem](d ) ]",
    ". it could be , therefore , the case that the data point in question ( @xmath23  mt and @xmath2456.3  k ) , measured on a polycrystalline sample , features a contribution from both single-@xmath19 and skx phases .",
    "however , it is also worth recalling that the phase diagram of the thinned samples supports the existence of skyrmions over a wider range of the @xmath5-@xmath25 phase diagram than for the bulk , so the cases are not straightforwardly comparable .    one crude way to identify the skx region of the phase diagram from these data is via the relatively tapered lineshape observed in that phase . to this end ,",
    "[ contour](a ) shows one possible parametrization of our data that approximately captures the characteristic signal in the skx region . in fig .",
    "[ contour](a ) we show the ratio of @xmath26 ( the full peak width at 0.75 of the maximum spectral weight ) to @xmath27 ( the full width at half maximum ) .",
    "the contour plot in fig .",
    "[ contour](b ) shows that this quantity picks out the skx phase as an island centered around 57  k and 30  mt where @xmath28 is suppressed .",
    "moreover , despite the resolution of our contour plot being limited by the number of data points , we note the resemblance to the skyrmion phase boundaries reported elsewhere .",
    "most of the spectra obtained outside of the paramagnetic region display a small additional peak at the value of the applied field , which we ascribe to the diamagnetic response from a small portion of the muon ensemble .",
    "this might cause a further suppression of @xmath28 within the skx phase , whose suppression is otherwise caused by the tapered nature of the lineshape , as the diamagnetic contribution coincides with the peak in spectral weight in the muon response caused by the internal field distribution .",
    "the limitation of this method is apparent , however , in that the data point at 50  mt and 56.3  k discussed above gives a rather similar ratio to the points in the skx region , despite its lineshape being distinguishable via its asymmetry .",
    "as described above , one interpretation of this spectrum involves some portion of the signal arising from skyrmions , but it remains distinct from the other spectra from the skx phase , suggesting that there is a significant single-@xmath19 phase contribution .",
    "the normalized skewness of the distribution @xmath29 , defined via @xmath30 ^ 3 $ ] is shown in fig .",
    "[ contour](c ) .",
    "we find that @xmath29 is slightly enhanced in the skx phase compared to the single-@xmath19 phase , before dropping to a negative value in the paramagnetic ( pm ) phase . finally , the standard deviation fig .",
    "[ contour](d ) of the distribution @xmath31 increases fairly smoothly with decreasing temperature , but is less sensitive to the skx phase boundaries .",
    "our results suggest that tf @xmath0sr is sensitive to the skx phase through the muon line shape . assuming that this is the case we may consider the mechanisms for muon relaxation and the timescales involved .",
    "we note that , in contrast to muon spectroscopy , neutron measurements of the sl are insensitive to fluctuations on timescales much slower than @xmath32s ( where @xmath33  mev is the energy scale of the resolution of the measurement ) and so fluctuations on timescales longer than this appear static .",
    "neutrons therefore take a `` snap - shot '' of the behaviour compared to @xmath0sr measurements whose characteristic time scale is set by the gyromagnetic ratio of the muon ( @xmath34  mhz t@xmath8 ) .",
    "the sensitivity of the muon to the sl would imply that the signal from the long - range spin texture is not significantly motionally narrowed .",
    "this would imply that the sl itself is likely to be quasistatic on timescales @xmath35  ns .",
    "this is consistent with the long lengthscale dynamics observed via lorentz microscopy @xcite , which suggest rotations of the skyrmion texture take place on a 0.1  s timescale .",
    "consistent with the observation that the muon signal below @xmath22 is dominated by the the distribution of static internal magnetic fields are the results of the previous zero - field @xmath0sr study of this material@xcite .",
    "those measurements showed sizeable transverse relaxation of the muon precession signal , which decreased as the transition was approached from below , consistent with the decrease of the internal field with increasing temperature .",
    "this was accompanied by an increase in a small longitudinal relaxation rate , suggesting a slowing of residual dynamic fluctuations above 50  k ( i.e.  in the region of interest for our study ) .",
    "it might be expected that the nature of the dynamics changes in each of the magnetic phases .",
    "however , the contribution to the muon linewidth from the dynamic effects would seem to make only a small contribution to the overall shape .",
    "further tf measurements were also made on a powder sample at isis using the musr instrument .",
    "in this case , we obtain similar responses as those reported above , although the analysis of these are complicated by a sizeable background contribution from muons stopping in the sample holder or cryostat tails .",
    "example frequency spectra , obtained via maximum entropy analysis of the measured time - domain spectra , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : isis ] for cuts through the skx phase in field and temperature .",
    "in these we see that a knee in the spectrum develops in the skx phase fig .  [",
    "fig : isis](b , e ) on the high field side of the peak region [ fig .",
    "[ fig : isis](a ) ] .",
    "this corresponds to the slow decay of the lineshape in high field seen in the s@xmath14s data in fig .",
    "[ fig : freq - domain ] .",
    "this feature is lost when we enter the single-@xmath19 phase fig .",
    "[ fig : isis](c , f ) , where the spectral weight in the knee is seen to decay into a broad distribution . in the multi-@xmath19 phase , the line is seen to be very narrow , suggesting that the background contribution is dominant in this case .",
    "measurements were repeated on other batches of powder sample , which showed some slight deviations in the position of the phase boundary to the paramagnetic phase , which we attribute to sample variability .",
    "we also made measurements at isis on mosaics of unoriented single crystal samples , which showed consistent results , although the lack of angular averaging and some sample variability makes a detailed comparison difficult .",
    "in order to understand these results we have simulated the expected distribution @xmath10 for the spin configurations of this material .",
    "owing to the complexity of the problem in a system with multiple muon sites and a complicated spin configuration , we have simulated the field distributions expected for a single crystal orientation , with the applied magnetic field along @xmath36 $ ] . for simplicity",
    "we generate our skyrmion spin textures here using the three-@xmath19 approach outlined below .",
    "we note that more sophisticated treatments of the sl are possible ( e.g.  ref .  ) , whose predictions are generally in better agreement with observations . for our simulation , skyrmion - like spin configurations",

    "we generate a skyrmion lattice magnetization texture in the [ 110 ] plane by taking @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the skyrmion wavelength . for our simulations we used a value of @xmath50 unit cells , similar to",
    "that suggested in ref .",
    "this method results in a ferromagnetic ( fm ) ordering of the spins within a crystalline unit cell . by reversing the spin on the cu1 sites",
    ", we generate ferrimagnetic ( fim ) configurations , which results in textures that match the observed magnetic structures of the system @xcite .",
    "in addition to the sl , we have generated spin textures for the helical phases .",

    "we chose to model this phase by calculating the field distributions for fim configurations reflecting six possible domains , each with equal population .",

    "@xmath59 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath53 and @xmath60 .",
    "we average over the distributions for the six resulting textures in order to obtain our overall distribution .",
    "we assume muons couple to the dipolar magnetic fields of the cu@xmath18 spins in the material .",
    "the dipole magnetic field component @xmath61 at a position @xmath62 are given by @xcite : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 run over all three cartesian directions , @xmath66 labels a cu ion at position @xmath67 , @xmath68 scales the magnetic moment to match the observed cu ions in these systems ( see below ) and @xmath69 .",
    "a previous zero field @xmath0sr study of this material @xcite found five muon stopping sites in each crystalline unit cell at positions @xmath70 and @xmath71 . we have simulated the field distribution @xmath10 expected in each of the phases at a variety of applied magnetic fields , assuming these previously proposed muon sites . for these simulations",

    ", the distributions were convolved with a simulated instrument function , generated with the wimda program .",
    "the results of these simulations are compared with the observed spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] . we see that the simulations capture the line shape in the skyrmion regime quite well and are distinguishable from the predicted line shapes in the other magnetic phases .",
    "although the agreement for the single-@xmath19 helical phase is reasonable , a discrepancy is evident in the multi-@xmath19 helical phase , as might be expected if the trial structure is not the correct one .",
    "( it is possible in this case that an alternative trial structure would produce results that match the measured spectra more closely . )",
    "we note that our results appear to be consistent with magnetic moments being localized on the cu@xmath18 ions , as was found from x - ray measurements @xcite ( although it is possible that a delocalized arrangement would match the data more closely in the multi-@xmath19 phase ) .",

    "it would therefore be difficult for this system to determine the @xmath49 in the absence of other detailed information about the phase , such as the magnetic structure , muon sites and moment sizes .    to gain some insight into how the field distributions shown in fig .",

    "this is complicated by the large number of inequivalent inequivalent muon sites @xcite and the ferrimagnetic arrangements of cu@xmath18 spins that forms the basis of the skyrmion spin texture .",
    "[ fig : sim2](a ) and ( b ) show examples of the magnitude of the dipole field found at two of the five crystallographically distinct muon sites , evaluated across a single skyrmion . the corresponding field distribution @xmath10 derived from each is also shown [ fig .",
