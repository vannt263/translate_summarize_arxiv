    "the electrical and chemical properties of fullerenes , namely `` buckyballs '' and nanotubes , remain the focus of thorough investigations  @xcite . the buckminsterfullerene molecule , @xmath0 , is a prototypical nanocluster because of its stability and nearly spherical shape . in particular",
    ", it is an ideal cage in which to trap so - called endohedral atoms , resulting in molecular systems with peculiar properties  @xcite , i.e. , enhanced stability with respect to temperature . in recent years , there has been a significant interest in subjecting @xmath0 to extreme conditions to probe its electronic and structural stability properties .",
    "a new class of experiments on @xmath0 driven by strong laser pulses show that its ionization and fragmentation properties are very sensitive to the laser intensity and polarization  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the yields show remarkable changes with the ellipticity of the laser field .    motivated by these findings , we consider the motion of an electron inside the valence shell of @xmath0 .",
    "the goal is to understand the electronic dynamics prior to photoionization . in",
    "strong linearly polarized laser fields , the ionized electron can return to the remaining ion by recolliding with the cage  @xcite when the laser field changes sign .",
    "this collision can lead to additional ionization or even fragmentation  @xcite of the molecule .",
    "in particular , we investigate the classical dynamics of a one - electron model in the shell of fullerene @xmath0 subjected to a strong circularly polarized laser field . in a circularly polarized field , the dynamics is best visualized in a frame co - rotating with the laser field where a conserved quantity emerges , the jacobi constant  @xcite .",
    "all results presented in this paper are in the rotating frame in which the circularly polarized laser becomes a static field with definite upfield and downfield directions .",
    "we restrict the dynamics to a two - dimensional configuration space ( the plane of polarization ) for the valence electron .",
    "the valence electron feels an averaged potential , which , as we later show ( sec .",
    "[ sec : ham_model ] ) , is very close to a spherical square well potential , where the electron bounces between the walls like a particle in an annular billiard .",
    "we choose a billiard model for its simplicity both analytically and numerically and because it serves as a faithful representation of the full model potential while not allowing ionization to occur .",
    "annular billiards occur in the literature in at least two contexts : fermi acceleration and the study of quantum chaos by comparison with classical and quantum mechanical computations  @xcite .",
    "chaotic dynamics arises either from pulsating boundaries or from an off - center inner wall . in our treatment",
    "the two walls are fixed and concentric .",
    "the main distinction here from other works on annular billiards is that in the rotating frame the electron moves along curved paths between successive wall collisions .",
    "the introduction of a coriolis term into the hamiltonian upon the transformation to the rotating frame is , of course , akin to introducing an effective uniform magnetic field ( and another frequency , the larmor frequency ) in which an electron moves on a curved path  @xcite .",
    "the laser wavelength is taken as 780 nm ( corresponding to a frequency of 0.0584  a.u . ) and its intensity is varied from zero to @xmath2 , which are values consistent with what is routinely performed in experiments on @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "our principal finding is that trajectories of the electron fall into one of three possible types which originate from specific parts of phase space .",
    "we identify various phase space structures which keep these trajectory types distinct from one another .",
    "our classification is as follows : first there are `` whispering gallery orbits '' ( wgo ) .",
    "these trajectories hit only the outer wall and their direction of travel , either clockwise or counterclockwise , is determined by which of the two regions in phase space where they originate .",
    "the second type , which we call `` daisies '' from their typical shape , hits both walls and can rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise . both daisies and wgos",
    "are called positive or negative based upon their direction of travel , counterclockwise or clockwise , respectively .",
    "the third type is mainly influenced by a very simple elliptic periodic orbit bouncing between the two walls in the downfield direction .",
    "the shape of these trajectories on the poincar section resembles a popular snack food , the pringles curved potato chip  @xcite , thus their designation as `` pringle orbits . ''",
    "we show that all the trajectories maintain their distinct characteristics with changing intensity because of a special class of invariant tori which do not fulfill the usual twist hypothesis required by the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theorem .",
    "these tori are usually denoted as `` twistless '' tori or shearless curves ( of the poincar map ) or `` meandering '' curves when they are associated with separatrix reconnection  @xcite .",
    "numerical studies show that these tori are very robust against perturbation , and are natural candidates for the partitioning of phase space into regions where well - defined , qualitatively distinct trajectories can be found .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynrules ] , we introduce the model and dynamical rules of the billiard and its corresponding hamiltonian and reflection guidelines . in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] , we give a qualitative analysis of different electron trajectories , and then relate them to the organization of phase space .",
    "next , we analyze the dynamics by using poincar section and frequency map analysis  @xcite in order to gain deeper insight into the properties and organization of phase space when the laser intensity is increased , and in particular concerning the role of twistless tori in the partitioning of phase space into three principal regions .",
    "a typical electron inside the shell feels the influence of the electrostatic potential created both by the positive charges from the nucleus and the electronic density , combined with the influence of the laser field .",

    "we build a billiard model along these lines , where the steep walls of the potential are replaced with infinite walls and the dynamics in the annular region between the two walls is given solely by the interaction of the electron with the electric field , later referred to as the laser - driven dynamics : @xmath24 and reflection rules are applied whenever the trajectory reaches @xmath25 or @xmath26 , which are 5.14 a.u . and 8.24 a.u .",

    "the resulting hamiltonian has two degrees of freedom and the value of the hamiltonian is the jacobi constant of celestial mechanics  @xcite .      the accessible part of phase space changes depending on the field frequency , amplitude , and the value of the jacobi constant .",
    "a revealing way to visualize the accessible part in position space is to compute the zero velocity surface  @xcite . by applying hamilton s equations to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) we arrive at    @xmath31    so that the jacobi constant becomes @xmath32 setting @xmath33 gives the zero - velocity surface @xmath34 which charts the lower limit of the accessible parts of the billiard , as @xmath35 is varied .",

    "the entire annulus is accessible to the dynamics . as the laser intensity",
    "is increased , the difference between the right and left sides of the well is amplified . in this paper",

    ", this critical value of @xmath37 is approximately equal to 0.15 .",
    "the dynamics is computed in a piecewise fashion because of the walls .",
    "it is composed of segments of laser - driven dynamics , as given by hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham ] ) , until the particle reaches one of the walls . at this instant ,",
    "the reflection rule is applied which mimics an elastic scattering at the limit of an infinitely stiff potential .    concerning the laser - driven dynamics ,",
    "the equations of motions associated with hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham ] ) are given by    [ eq : laserdrivendyn ] @xmath42    where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 are the initial conditions ( at time @xmath47 ) .    at time @xmath48",
    ", the electron reaches either one of the two walls and we apply the reflection condition before a next phase of laser - driven dynamics .",

    "in this section , we consider the linear effect of the rebound condition on neighboring trajectories .",
    "the motivation for doing so is twofold : first the tangent rebound condition can be used to compute the tangent flow of trajectories to deduce the linear stability of periodic orbits .",
    "second , as the billiard model corresponds to the limit of infinitely stiff potential for a hamiltonian system , the billiard model should preserve the hamiltonian structure .",
    "we have already checked that the rebound condition preserves the hamiltonian , thus the last prescription is that the symplectic two - form is preserved , or equivalently the tangent rebound matrix is symplectic .",
    "the tangent rebound matrix can be seen as an extension of the tangent flow  @xcite to include the impact of the rebound on neighboring trajectories ( to first order ) .",
    "for that , we consider a first trajectory with initial conditions @xmath62 at @xmath47 in the neighborhood of one of the two walls , i.e. , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , and such that the rebound time @xmath65 .",
    "then , we look at the impact of a perturbation of these initial conditions to @xmath66 immediately after the rebound . because the rebound time is not the same for the two trajectories , we have to consider a small laser - driven propagation before and after the rebound to deduce the tangent rebound properties . the situation is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : reboundlocalframe ] .",
    "the computation of the tangent rebound matrix is more easily seen in a rotated cartesian set of coordinates @xmath67 , for some angle  @xmath68 to be specified later . in the rotated frame",
    ", the corresponding hamiltonian reads @xmath69 where we have dropped the tildes for simplicity .",
    "since we are only interested in the linear properties of the rebound condition , throughout this section we consider all the equations linearized to the first order .    as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : sub_dynrules ] , the dynamics is computed piecewise with a first stage of laser - driven propagation until the electron reaches the wall , then the rebound condition and finally a new stage of laser - driven propagation . in the rotated frame and before the rebound , i.e. , @xmath70 , the laser - driven dynamics given by hamiltonian  ( [ eq : rotatedhamilt ] ) yields    [ eq : trajbeforerebound ] @xmath71    where we have neglected @xmath72 . at this stage , we select the rotation angle  @xmath68 such that the perpendicular direction to the wall at the rebound is aligned with the @xmath13-direction for the unperturbed trajectory . we keep this fixed frame for the perturbed trajectory . an alternative way ( which provides the same solution ) is to consider a perturbed rotated frame ( obtained by a rotation by an angle @xmath73 ) to impose the same constraint ( the direction perpendicular to the wall is the @xmath13-axis at the rebound ) on the perturbed trajectory . as a consequence of the chosen angle  @xmath68",
    ", the rebound condition solely depends on the @xmath13-direction , such that @xmath74 , or equivalently using eq .",
    "( [ eq : trajbeforerebound_x ] ) @xmath75 besides , because of the circular shape of the billiard and the angle @xmath68 , at the rebound the @xmath14-component vanishes ( @xmath76 )",
    ". however , for the perturbed trajectory , this condition does not apply . since we consider the perturbed trajectory comparatively to the original one in the same rotated frame , it is easier for the purpose of the calculation to keep formally the @xmath14-components , knowing that it is actually equal to zero .",
    "the next step for the trajectory dynamics is the rebound condition , at time @xmath48 . because of the orientation of the frame where the @xmath13-direction is aligned with the radial one , the rebound condition  ( [ eq : reboundcondition ] ) becomes  @xmath77 and @xmath78 which implies to the momenta @xmath79 and @xmath80 , while the positions are left unchanged .    finally ,",
    "after the rebound , the trajectory experiences a new phase of laser driven dynamics . combining the rebound condition  ( [ eq : rotatedreboundcondition ] ) with a linearized propagation similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : trajbeforerebound ] ) , one can write the dynamics after the rebound as a function of the initial conditions ( before the rebound ) , such that    [ eq : afterrebounddynamics ] @xmath81    where the equations are linearized at the first order in time . with the explicit formula for the dynamics after the rebound , as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : afterrebounddynamics ] ) , it is straightforward to compute the impact of the perturbation on the initial conditions by replacing @xmath62 with @xmath66 respectively . because of the change of initial conditions , the rebound time is modified to @xmath82 as well .",

    "( [ eq : reboundtime ] ) for the perturbed trajectory we end up with @xmath83 finally , combining eq .",
    "( [ eq : afterrebounddynamics ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq : perturbedreboundtime ] ) it is possible to compute the perturbed dynamics after the rebound .",
    "we define the deviations @xmath84 of the perturbed trajectory after the rebound . for instance , considering the @xmath13-coordinate , we obtain @xmath85 since we are interested in the dynamics in the vicinity of the rebound , we consider the limits @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( such that @xmath88 ) . as a consequence , we end up with @xmath89 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : x - dir_perturbation ] ) . a similar procedure can be applied to the other components and summarized in the linear equation @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the tangent rebound matrix given by @xmath92 using the conditions @xmath93 , @xmath36 and where @xmath94 is taken _",

    "a sampling of typical trajectories of the annular billiard for @xmath100 is shown in fig .  [",

    "these examples illustrate qualitatively the different types of observed trajectories already discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] . in the top row",
    "we see that the trajectories only hit the outer wall and never the inner wall and are therefore `` whispering gallery orbits '' , or wgos . in the middle row",

    "they are qualitatively the same , hitting both walls successively and accessing the entire angular distribution of the billiard . both wgo and `` daisy orbits ''",
    "keep a constant rotational direction , either clockwise or counterclockwise , which we denote negative or positive , respectively . in the bottom row , left panel we see a `` pringle orbit '' , hitting both walls in turn , however , limited only to the downfield region of the billiard .",
    "the simple two rebound trajectories located at both extremes of the upfield and downfiled region of the billiard are periodic orbits .",

    "is a trajectory which hits neither wall ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : nowallhit ] ) . in the following sections we connect these trajectories to phase space structures and their stability .",
    "since the dynamical system has two degrees of freedom , a convenient way to visualize the dynamical organization of phase space is by poincar sections .",
    "here we consider a poincar section with equation @xmath101 in the direction @xmath102 .",
    "the rebound condition  ( [ eq : reboundcondition ] ) imposes a discontinuity in the radial momentum @xmath53 at the rebound , such that formally the condition @xmath101 is never reached during a rebound .",
    "however , we see the billiard as the limit of an infinitely stiff potential , and a smoother dynamics corresponding to hamiltonian  ( [ eq : fullmodel_ham ] ) would reach @xmath101 before changing sign .",
    "as a consequence , we consider the rebounds on the walls as potential candidates for the poincar section .",
    "the electron either rebounds on the outer wall , meaning that the radial momentum changes from positive to negative values or the electron rebounds on the inner wall , so that the radial momentum changes from negative to positive values . in order to comply with the transverse condition @xmath102",
    "we include only the collisions with the inner wall .",
    "furthermore , because of the rebound condition  ( [ eq : reboundcondition ] ) we note that @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 are continuous under a rebound so that it is equivalent to record their values either directly before or after the rebound .",
    "the poincar section can be represented in several ways .",
    "a three - dimensional plot can be used where we plot @xmath106 or we can make a projection onto the plane @xmath107 using the constant jacobi constraint .",
    "regardless of which method is chosen there are two types of points on the section : the first kind are points on the inner wall for which @xmath25 and @xmath53 chosen so as to satisfy the condition on the jacobi constant @xmath37 .",
    "the second kind are points for which @xmath101 and @xmath108 is chosen so as to satisfy @xmath37 . in this paper , for the sake of simplicity of our figures , we make use of the projection onto the two dimensional plane @xmath107 , however , we show the three dimensional counterpart in fig .",
    "[ fig:3dpoinc ] where we have colored `` pringle '' trajectories in blue to illustrate their namesake shape .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the choice of poincar section is a good one , i.e. ,  do all trajectories intersect the poincar section ? a small subset of trajectories which are noteworthy for both their peculiarity and the dynamics they showcase , do not intersect the poincar section @xmath101 . in that spirit we analyze the trajectories which do not collide with either wall . for such trajectories",
    ", @xmath109 needs to remain between @xmath110 and @xmath111 at all times .",
    "the dynamics of these trajectories is governed by hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ham ] ) .",
    "using the translation @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , the hamiltonian is mapped to @xmath116 where we have dropped the tildes for simplicity .",
    "the dynamical features no longer depend on the value of @xmath15 .",
    "the dynamics is better seen in polar coordinates , where the hamiltonian becomes @xmath117 since @xmath103 is a conserved quantity , the dynamics is that of a particle evolving in a potential equal to @xmath118 and the particle will collide with a wall unless @xmath119 . in the case",
    "where , @xmath119 , @xmath53 is constant , and it has to vanish so that no collision with the walls takes place .",
    "therefore the only trajectories which do not hit a wall are circular orbits ( since @xmath120 ) . in the original coordinates , these circular",

    ", there exist a priori an infinite number of such orbits since the radius is not fixed .",
    "the only constraint on the radius is that the circular orbit has to fit inside the annulus .",
    "based on the laser parameters @xmath15 and @xmath10 , the existence and characterization of such orbits can be divided into several categories . for realistic fullerene parameters , @xmath124 , which is considered here , the analysis can be grouped into four categories .",

    "in fact , wgos appear only when the entire annulus is accessible , e.g. in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : poincsections ] .      because of the dimensionality of the billiard ( two degrees of freedom ) invariant kam tori constitute barriers of transport which confine the ( chaotic ) dynamics to distinct regions of phase space .",
    "however , they are not robust enough to partition phase space at sufficiently high value of the intensity . here",
    ", our analysis reveals the existence of much more robust invariant objects , namely twistless tori which are particularly relevant for the organization of phase space  @xcite , since they partition phase space at relatively high intensities into regions where the different types of trajectories occur .",
    "we next introduce a diagnostic tool for finding these tori .",
    "frequency analysis  @xcite is a practical tool in hamiltonian systems for analysis of the dynamics .",
    "for integrable systems written in action - angle variables @xmath150 , the method consists of plotting the frequency @xmath151 as a function of @xmath152 , which is expected to be smooth for ( sufficiently smooth ) integrable systems . for nearly integrable systems ,",
    "the frequency is computed by a windowed fourier transform of a chosen observable .",
    "it is computed for an ensemble of trajectories , and plotted , for instance , as a function of the initial value of the action . from this analysis it is possible to identify elliptic and hyperbolic islands , regular regions filled by kam tori , and chaotic regions by their respective unique signatures .",
    "the elliptic islands are expressed as constant frequency plateaus , the hyperbolic orbits by cusps in the frequency , regular regions as apparently continuous curves , and chaotic regions as non - smooth sections .",
    "frequency analysis can also identify regions where the twist condition is not satisfied , i.e. , when @xmath153 is no longer a monotonous function of the action . in this case , the standard twist condition for the standard kam theorem is not satisfied , and it gives rise to a new taxonomy of dynamical mechanisms , like separatrix reconnection and twistless tori  @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : freqmap ] we plot the frequency as a function of the initial momentum @xmath103 .",
    "the ensemble of trajectories are the series of points on the poincar section with initial conditions @xmath154 and various @xmath103 while imposing the jacobi constraint to compute the other variables .",
    "the motivation is that for the integrable case @xmath103 is a conserved quantity .",
    "the frequency analysis of the integrable case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : freqmap ] , upper panel ) shows that the frequency is a continuously varying function of @xmath103 , as is expected .",
    "the most interesting feature is that the frequency map does not change monotonically with @xmath103 .",
    "this implies the existence of twistless tori located at the extrema of the frequency map , at @xmath155 and @xmath156 . in the non - integrable case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : freqmap ] , lower panel ) , we see the appearence of a plateau which corresponds to the `` pringle orbits '' . in addition we notice some chaotic features in the insets , even if the overall behavior seems to be quite regular at this intensity .",
    "furthermore , the frequency map still exhibits two extrema , again which correspond to twistless tori . a closer look at the frequency map around @xmath157 and @xmath158 ( insets ) reveals a rich dynamics with a succession of elliptic and hyperbolic orbits , even if the overall behavior seems to be quite regular .      the aforementioned twistless tori are visualized by high resolution poincar sections .",
    "figure  [ fig : meanderingtori ] shows poincar sections with initial conditions nearby @xmath159 ( upper panel ) and @xmath160 ( lower panel ) , corresponding to the local maxima in fig .  [ fig : freqmap ] .",
    "both poincar sections are similar in that they show well - developed chaotic regions sandwiched between two regular regions .",
    "the regular regions correspond to wgos , shown in blue , and `` daisy orbits '' , shown in red .",
    "likewise , the chaotic region in both panels exhibits a stratification whereby a trajectory originating in one of these regions remains there and can not pass to another chaotic region .",
    "the stratification is not due to kam tori since kam tori come in families .",
    "instead it is caused by the existence of twistless tori , which , having dimension two , can partition phase space . in particular in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : meanderingtori ] , we recognize one of the signatures of twistless tori which is the meandering behavior ( see for instance the interface between the orange and the dark red chaotic regions ) .",
    "the black line , superimposed over both panels , separates the two different possible ways of intersecting the poincar section .",
    "points on the section above ( resp .",
    "below ) the black line for the upper ( lower ) panel are standard intersections of the flow with the poincar section in the sense that @xmath53 changes sign smoothly before and after the intersection",
    ". points below ( resp . above )",
    "the black curve for the upper ( lower ) panel are collisions with the inner wall where the sign of @xmath53 changes due to the rebound condition ( see sec .  [ sec : ps ] ) .",
    "as expected , all the wgo trajectories are below the black curve in the lower panel ( since none of their points intersect the inner wall ) .",
    "the entire wgo region is regular .",
    "we also notice that all the `` daisy orbits '' are above the black curve , and this region is also mostly regular . between these two regions is a strongly chaotic region with very few elliptic islands .",
    "each of the chaotic regions ( in both panels ) has a portion above and below the black line .",
    "the range of @xmath68 where each chaotic region exists above ( below ) the black line gives the accessible region of the inner wall to the electron .",
    "figure  [ fig : transition ] illustrates how the accessible region of the inner wall changes as one moves from wgos to `` daisies '' in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : meanderingtori ] . beginning with the wgos , shown in blue , which have no points above the black line ( no accessible region on the inner wall ) we increase @xmath103 to the light blue region",
    "there is a small range of @xmath68 values for which the chaotic region is above the black line .",
    "the @xmath68 values are centered about @xmath161 and they correspond to the area along the inner wall which is accessible to the electron .",
    "moving again upwards in @xmath103 we pass by several more chaotic regions , each having a wider range of @xmath68 above the black line which allows for a wider range of the inner wall to be visited by the electron .",
    "the inner wall becomes more accessible until finally reaching the `` daisy '' region , shown in red . at this point ,",
    "all intersections of the poincar section are above the black line covering @xmath162 $ ] and therefore the entire inner wall is accessible .",
    "the four twistless tori which exist in this chaotic region are responsible for the discrete transition from wgos to `` daisy orbits '' .",
    "likewise , a simiar feature can be observed for the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : meanderingtori ] , nearby @xmath163 , however there are fewer chaotic regions and hence fewer twistless tori .",
    "the motivation of our work stems from recent photoionization experiments in strong field of atoms and molecules in both circular and linear polarized light where a significant variation of the yields with polarization was observed  @xcite .",
    "we propose a rather simple dynamical model for the motion of a valence electron inside the valence shell of fullerene @xmath0 , namely an annular billiard .",
    "we have investigated the dynamics when this electron is subjected to a circularly polarized laser field .",
    "we have shown that it exhibits three distinct types of trajectories : `` whispering gallery '' , `` daisy '' and `` pringle '' orbits .",
    "these trajectories are found in distinct , identifiable regions of phase space for a wide range of laser intensity and jacobi values .",
    "they are kept characteristically segregated from each other by the existence of twistless tori which partition phase space .",
    "the twistless tori are identified through a frequency analysis and are confirmed by generation of high resolution poincar sections .",
    "these twistless tori , blessed with high stability , exist in chaotic regions where kam tori have been broken by the strong laser field . because of the barriers they create , twistless tori , allow for a transition scenario from wgo orbits to `` daisy orbits '' in both rotational directions , positive and negative .",
