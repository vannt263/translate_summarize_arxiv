    "in quantum field theories based on operator formalism , the creation and annihilation field operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the fundamental objects creating and annihilating resp .",
    "particles in quantum states denoted by quantum numbers @xmath2 , as for example , by the momentum @xmath3 and the spin projection @xmath4 . in any quantum field theory",
    "the number of the operator @xmath5 pairs is infinite .",
    "these operators satisfy the canonical commutation or anticommutation relations @xmath6 the operators @xmath7 act on state vectors @xmath8 which span a hilbert space @xmath9 . in order to achieve a unique specification of the commutator or anticommutator ring of the operators ( [ 1.1 ] ) , in addition to ( [ 1.1 ] ) one requires the existence of a vacuum state @xmath10 in the hilbert space @xmath9 for which @xmath11 for all @xmath2 . in this case , the hilbert space @xmath9 is a space for a representation of the commutator or anticommutator ring ( [ 1.1 ] ) with the auxiliary condition ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "as long as the number of the operators @xmath7 entering the algebraic structure ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 1.2 ] ) is finite , there exists only one inequivalent representation for the algebraic relations ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "however , in quantum field theories describing systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom , the algebraic structure ( [ 1.1 ] ) has infinitely many inequivalent representations @xcite .",
    "intuitively speaking , one can say that there exist infinitely many different and inequivalent matrix realizations of the operators @xmath1 and @xmath0 satisfying the same algebraic structure as ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "the situation reminds us very distantly of a lie algebra of a non - compact group which has infinitely many unitary irreducible representations for its generators realized in forms of infinitely dimensional matrices .",
    "in contrast to the aforementioned lie algebra with a finite number of its generators , the canonical ring ( [ 1.1 ] ) involves infinite number of the elements @xmath1 and @xmath0 which can be realized by infinitely many different and inequivalent representations in forms of infinitely dimensional matrices .    the operators @xmath1 and @xmath0 entering the ring ( [ 1.1 ] ) are assumed to form a complete set of operators which means that every operator in a quantum field theory can be built up out of them .",
    "thus a grand canonical hamiltonian @xmath12 governing the dynamics of a given physical system is expressed as a given function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath13 the grand canonical partition function @xmath14 is expressed as the density matrix trace @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the inverse temperature .",
    "all thermodynamic properties of the system are determined by the grand canonical potential @xmath17 the statistical average values corresponding to physical observables associated with operators @xmath18 are determined by the relations @xmath19 the grand canonical potential ( [ 1.5 ] ) and statistical average values ( [ 1.6 ] ) specify the so - called gibbs state of the system governed by the given hamiltonian ( [ 1.3 ] ) .",
    "since the commutator or anticommutator ring ( [ 1.1 ] ) admits infinitely many inequivalent representations for the operators @xmath1 and @xmath0 , it implies that one has to associate the corresponding inequivalent representations to the hamiltonian @xmath12 , partition function @xmath14 and grand canonical potential @xmath20 .",
    "again , intuitively speaking , one can say that the matrix form of the hamiltonian ( [ 1.3 ] ) is distinct for each inequivalent representation of the ring ( [ 1.1 ] ) . this implies that the partition function ( [ 1.4 ] ) , grand canonical potential ( [ 1.5 ] ) and statistical average values of physical observables ( [ 1.6 ] ) are distinct for each inequivalent representation of ( [ 1.1 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the same hamiltonian @xmath12 gives rise to different results for @xmath14 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 corresponding to chosen inequivalent representations of the canonical ring ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "it implies that in each quantum field theory a given hamiltonian can give rise to infinitely many gibbs states .",
    "this theoretical conclusion seems to be in a conflict with the experience because every physical system resides always in a single gibbs state for given values of thermodynamic variables , like temperature @xmath22 , volume @xmath23 and particle number @xmath24 .",
    "the single gibbs state corresponds to a single inequivalent representation of the commutator or anticommutator ring ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "the answer how one should select an appropriate single inequivalent representation for a system at given values @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 out of infinitively many representations is uniquely given by the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics requires , e.g. , the helmholtz free energy @xmath25 at given values of the thermodynamic variables @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 to be minimal with respect to any free parameters entering @xmath25 . theoretically , it means that one should evaluate the helmholtz free energies @xmath25 for all inequivalent representations of ( [ 1.1 ] ) and select that single one which corresponds to their infimum at the given range of the thermodynamic variables @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . a concrete example will demonstrate how it is done in practice .    for detailed understanding of inequivalent representations of the commutator or anticommutator ring ( [ 1.1 ] ) of field operators role in practical applications we will study them from three different aspects .",
    "first , we will explicitly construct a certain class of inequivalent representations of the anticommutator ring ( [ 1.1 ] ) of field operators .",
    "second , we will show how one , in practical calculations , tacitly selects a single inequivalent representation by choosing an appropriate perturbation theory . at third",
    ", theoretical implications of inequivalent representations of electron field operator anticommutator ring will be explicitly demonstrated on the bcs model hamiltonian of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "more specifically , a new class of inequivalent representations of ( [ 1.1 ] ) , which has not been known till now and leads to a new unexpected superconducting state , will be constructed .",
    "for the purpose of practical applications to the bcs model hamiltonian @xcite and for the sake of simplicity , we consider a complete set of annihilation and creation operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 of the fermion type .",
    "let the index @xmath28 run over integer numbers over the interval @xmath29 and @xmath4 denotes spin @xmath30 projection of a fermion , i.e. , @xmath31 . in order to have a quantum field theory",
    ", we take the limit @xmath32 .",
    "the field operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 satisfy the anticommutator ring @xmath33 with the subsidiary condition @xmath34 on the vacuum state @xmath10 for all @xmath35 .",
    "the representation space for the anticommutator ring ( [ 2.1 ] ) with the subsidiary condition ( [ 2.2 ] ) can be chosen to be the hilbert space @xmath9 spanned by the basis vectors @xmath36 defined by the formula @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the occupation numbers of fermions in states @xmath35 , and @xmath39 denotes an infinite number array of items @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "each such infinite array specifies one of the basis vectors of the hilbert space @xmath9 .",
    "next we construct a class of inequivalent representations of the anticommutator ring ( [ 2.1 ] ) by adopting the same approach as outlined in haag s work @xcite , however , for boson operators .",
    "we start from the operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 obeying ( [ 2.1 ] ) and introduce the `` unitary '' transformations @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the hermitian `` operator '' @xmath44 and @xmath45 are arbitrary real parameters . the anticommutation relations for the transformed operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 are , of course , the same as given by ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",

    "the transformation @xmath48 transforms every basis vector @xmath55 into one @xmath58 of @xmath54 , given by the formula @xmath59\\sin \\alpha_{k}+\\big(a^{\\dagger}_{k,+}a^{\\dagger}_{-k,-}\\big)^{n_{k}}\\cos \\alpha_{k}\\bigg\\}\\phi_0\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the result is that the scalar product @xmath60 for every basis vector @xmath8 of @xmath9 given by ( [ 2.3 ] ) is either identically equal to zero or equal to the infinite product @xmath61 where @xmath62 however , the infinite product ( [ 2.12 ] ) diverges also to zero in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "this is so because by noting the properties of the coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 given by ( [ 2.13 ] ) we see that the scalar product ( [ 2.12 ] ) reduces to the infinite product of the following type @xmath65 the last relation implies that the hilbert space @xmath54 spanned by the transformed state vectors @xmath53 contains a subspace of the state vectors @xmath66 which are orthogonal to every vector @xmath8 of @xmath9 .",
    "we make the same conclusion as in haag s work @xcite : @xmath46 and @xmath47 given by ( [ 2.4 ] ) are operators satisfying the same canonical ring as ( [ 2.1 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath67 but there is no proper unitary transformation connecting these two operator systems",
    ". the operators @xmath68 and the operators @xmath69 act in two different hilbert spaces @xmath9 and @xmath54 respectively . in haag",
    "s terminology , they belong to inequivalent representations of the same anticommutator ring ( [ 2.1 ] ) or ( [ 2.15 ] ) of the field operators . it is a simple matter to show that among all transformed vectors @xmath53 there is no one such as @xmath70 for which @xmath71 for all @xmath35 .",
    "next we supplement the new hilbert space @xmath54 spanned by all state vectors @xmath53 with the vacuum state @xmath70 satisfying the auxiliary condition ( [ 2.16 ] ) .    each inequivalent representation of the anticommutator ring ( [ 2.15 ] ) with the subsidiary condition ( [ 2.16 ] ) is specified by a chosen infinite set of parameters @xmath45 entering the transformations ( [ 2.4])-([2.9 ] ) .",
    "thus , the number of the inequivalent representations of ( [ 2.15 ] ) is indeed infinite . in contradistinction to inequivalent representations of lie algebras , where the representations are specified by a finite number of casimir operator eigenvalues , the inequivalent representations of the anticommutator ring ( [ 2.15 ] ) of the field operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 are specified by infinite set of parameters .    our analysis of inequivalent representations of the anticommutator ring of the field operators ( [ 2.1 ] ) , as presented above , can be generalized in a straightforward way to any set of quantum numbers @xmath35 and to many other classes of inequivalent representations both for fermions and bosons .",
    "next we consider a hamiltonian @xmath12 governing a physical system with an infinite number of degrees of freedom as a given function of the operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath72 the field operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 and the corresponding hamiltonian ( [ 2.17 ] ) act in the representation space which is the hilbert space @xmath9 spanned by the basis vectors given by ( [ 2.3 ] ) . in this representation",
    "we have the corresponding partition function @xmath73 and statistical average values @xmath21 of physical observables associated with operators @xmath18 given by the relations @xmath74    for each inequivalent representation of the anticommutator ring ( [ 2.15 ] ) we can construct the transformed hamiltonian @xmath75 in its normal form by employing the canonical anticommutator relations ( [ 2.15 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding partition function @xmath76 can be different from that given by ( [ 2.18 ] ) because the operators @xmath77 and @xmath78 act in two different hilbert spaces @xmath9 and @xmath54 respectively . by the same way ,",
    "the statistical average value @xmath21 corresponding to a physical observable @xmath79 can be different from that given by ( [ 2.19 ] ) .",
    "these conclusions may seem to be paradoxes residing in facts as if physical observables were dependent on our will how we select a single inequivalent representation for the anticommutator ring of the field operators ( [ 2.15 ] ) .",
    "there is , in fact , no freedom in selecting an appropriate inequivalent representation of ( [ 2.15 ] ) .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , the second law of thermodynamics dictates uniquely which inequivalent representation is relevant for describing the physical system at given values of thermodynamic variables .",
    "one may even incorrectly believe that the conclusion concerning the different results for the same physical quantities given by the relations ( [ 2.18 ] ) and ( [ 2.21 ] ) or by the relations ( [ 2.19 ] ) and ( [ 2.22 ] ) are wrong .",
    "such an incorrect belief is supported by the formal appearance of the transformation ( [ 2.20 ] ) which seems to be a similarity transformation .",
    "the unpermited application of the cyclic properties for the trace of infinitely dimensional matrices product would lead to incorrect conclusions that the results of the relations ( [ 2.18 ] ) , ( [ 2.20 ] ) or ( [ 2.19 ] ) , ( [ 2.21 ] ) are identical .",
    "we conclude this section by stating that in quantum field theory a given hamiltonian @xmath12 of a system leads to distinct results for the partition function @xmath14 and for the statistical average values of physical observables @xmath21 depending on a selected inequivalent representation of the anticommutator ring of field operators .",
    "these conclusions will be explicitly demonstrated on the bcs model hamiltonian of superconductivity .",
    "in this section we elucidate how one tacitly selects a single inequivalent representation out of infinitely many representations of the commutator or anticommutator ring ( [ 1.1 ] ) of field operators in a practical application of quantum field theory . in quantum field theories with interactions between fields there is not known even one physical example with an exact solution . in all practical applications one divides hamiltonian @xmath12 of a system into the sum @xmath80 where @xmath81 is called the unperturbed hamiltonian and the remaining term @xmath82 is called the perturbative part .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath81 is chosen in a way to be exactly diagonalized and by this fact its effects are treated exactly .",
    "its eigenvalues @xmath83 , where @xmath84 denotes an array with an infinite number of items form a complete basis of a hilbert space @xmath9 .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath9 is the representation space for a single inequivalent representation of the commutator or anticommutator ring ( [ 2.1 ] ) of the field operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 entering the hamiltonian ( [ 3.1 ] ) .",
    "the unperturbed partition function @xmath85 can be exactly evaluated and is typical for the chosen inequivalent representation .",

    "it is needless to say that the statistical average values ( [ 3.5 ] ) are evaluated in the chosen inequivalent representation .",
    "however , the splitting of the total hamiltonian as given by ( [ 3.1 ] ) is not unique .",
    "one can equally well divide the same hamiltonian as @xmath90 where the new unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath91 is by definition different from @xmath81 and is not related to @xmath81 by any proper unitary transformation .",
    "the new unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath91 is assumed to be diagonalized by such transformations of the field operators @xmath26 and @xmath27 like ( [ 2.4 ] ) in order to achieve its diagonal form @xmath92 the requirement to have @xmath93 in its diagonal form puts certain constraints on the transformation parameters @xmath45 entering the transformations ( [ 2.4])-([2.9 ] ) .",
    "in other words , all transformation parameter @xmath45 values are determined by a finite set of physical parameters present in the chosen unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath94 .",
    "since the infinite set of parameters @xmath45 specifies a single inequivalent representation of the commutator or anticommutator ring of the field operators ( [ 2.15 ] ) , with new chosen unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath91 one again tacitly selects another single inequivalent representation .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath95 of @xmath96 form again a complete basis of a new hilbert space @xmath54 for the new selected inequivalent representation .    in this inequivalent representation one gets the unperturbed partition function @xmath97 which is , of course , different from ( [ 3.2 ] ) by the definitions ( [ 3.1 ] ) and ( [ 3.6 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding total partition function @xmath98 is also distinct from that given by ( [ 3.3 ] ) because the same hamiltonian @xmath12 has two different , so to speak , `` matrix '' realizations ( [ 3.1 ] ) and ( [ 3.3 ] ) corresponding to two different inequivalent representations of the anticommutator ring of field operators ( [ 2.1 ] ) or ( [ 2.15 ] ) .    by the same approach as outlined above , one can continue to study a series of inequivalent representations associated with a given hamiltonian @xmath12 . by selecting a series @xmath99 of unperturbed hamiltonians @xmath100",
    ", @xmath101 , @xmath102 one can explore physical properties of the corresponding series of different gibbs states associated with the same hamiltonian @xmath12 .",
    "the aforementioned methods will be explicitly demonstrated for the investigation of physical properties of several distinct gibbs states associated with the bcs model hamiltonian in theory of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the bcs hamiltonian has been deliberately chosen from three different reasons .    at first , the bcs hamiltonian is generally very well - known , extraordinary simple and despite of its simplicity it has been very successful in explaining properties of a large class of the so - called low temperature superconductors ( lts ) on terms of only two phenomenological material parameters . on the other hand , properties of high temperature superconductors ( hts ) having anisotropic layered structures are claimed to be unexplainable on the basis of the bcs theory .    at second , the bcs theory as a theory with a nontrivial interactions between electrons has provided us with two different solutions for the gibbs states which are asymptotically exact in the thermodynamic limit .    at third , the bcs theory has been studied from various aspects for many years .",
    "that is why there is a generally spread belief that its consequences are completely exhausted and therefore there are no motivations for its further exploration .",
    "however , its consequences has not been studied from the point of view of inequivalent representations of the anticommutator ring of electron field operators ( [ 2.1 ] ) or ( [ 2.15 ] ) yet . since the ring has infinitely many inequivalent representations the bcs hamiltonian should have infinitely many gibbs states .",
    "it is , therefore , worthwhile to undertake the task to find at least one new gibbs state associated with the bcs hamiltonian .",
    "the bcs theory is based on the following well - known grand canonical hamiltonian @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the kinetic energy of an electron ( in the state specified by the wave vector @xmath3 ) counted from the chemical potential @xmath84 which can be approximated by the fermi energy @xmath105 , i.e. , @xmath106 .",

    "the grand canonical potential difference ( [ 4.5 ] ) is particularly convenient for two reasons .",
    "first , it expresses physical anomalies associated with the interaction term @xmath82 above the background corresponding to properties of the ideal electron gas .",
    "second , it exhibits manifestly the dependence of @xmath20 on a chosen inequivalent representation of the anticommutator ring ( [ 2.1 ] ) of the electron field operators entering the hamiltonian @xmath12 . in practical calculations one can not evaluate the exact average value @xmath121 and must resort to a perturbation theory by selecting an unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath81 which can be exactly diagonalized .    with a chosen unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath81 one calculates the unperturbed grand canonical partition function ( [ 3.2 ] ) and the corresponding statistical averages @xmath126 of operators @xmath127 defined by the relations @xmath128 the average value @xmath123 entering the relations ( [ 4.4 ] ) and ( [ 4.5 ] ) can be expressed in the form @xmath129 where @xmath130 represents symbolically all contributions coming from remaining perturbative terms .",
