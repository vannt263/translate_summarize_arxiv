    "the study of conformal boundary conditions ( cbc ) and boundary operators is one of the most fruitful aspects of the vast problem of solving two dimensional field theories and string theories .",
    "there are many reasons for this . in the equivalent 1 + 1 dimensional systems ,",
    "cbc describe possible fixed points in quantum impurity problems , such as the multichannel kondo problem @xcite , while boundary operators decide the stability of these fixed points as well as rg flows . in string",
    "theory , cbc describe possible branes , while rg flows in this language decide issues of ( open string ) tachyon decay @xcite . in statistical mechanics ,",
    "boundaries are roughly where couplings to the outside take place  for instance couplings to electrodes in quantum hall effect type problems and their chalker - coddington type lattice formulations @xcite .    from a more formal point of view , conformal field theories ( cfts ) with boundaries are easier to tackle than their bulk counterparts when complicated features such as indecomposability or non - unitarity are present . most of the recent progress in our understanding of logarithmic cfts for instance has come from the consideration of their boundary analogues @xcite .    taking a slightly different point of view , one of the basic objects in our understanding of cfts has been the @xmath4 loop model , which led , in particular , to the development of deep links with the powerful sle approach @xcite .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that the issue of cbc for loop models should be a major problem .",
    "this issue has however been slow to evolve , in part for technical reasons : the coulomb gas formalism , which is so successful in the bulk case , is very difficult to carry out in the presence of boundaries , for not entirely clear reasons @xcite .",
    "it took progress on the algebraic side  through the study of boundary algebras and spin models with general boundary fields  for the simplest families of cbc to even be identified properly .",
    "the works @xcite finally showed that cbc were obtained in the dense loop model by simply giving to loops touching the boundary a fugacity @xmath5 different from the one in the bulk .",
    "associated conformal weights and spectra of conformal descendents were identified , and deep connections with the blob algebra @xcite ( also called the one - boundary temperley - lieb algebra ) made .",
    "subsequently , beautiful calculations in 2d gravity @xcite recovered the results of @xcite .",
    "this will all be summarized in later sections .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to continue the study of @xcite and discuss situations with several boundaries and boundary conditions . in the case of calculations on an annulus for instance , this means giving different weights to loops touching the left , the right or both boundaries .",
    "we will end up in these cases with generating functions depending on seven parameters , and of course numerous potential applications to counting problems .",
    "technically , the geometrical situation on the annulus has to do with understanding representations of two - boundary temperley - lieb algebras .",
    "we will devote a fair amount of time to this issue , which is essential in obtaining some of our results and conjectures .",
    "for early work and results in this direction see @xcite .",
    "the problem on the annulus is also deeply related with determining the spectra of xxz hamiltonians with the most general boundary fields : this has been a very active question in the bethe ansatz community lately @xcite .",
    "we will in particular provide a complete answer for the spectrum of these hamiltonians in the scaling limit .",
    "more formally , the key question behind the calculations we will present is the determination of fusion rules ( and thus spectra of boundary conditions changing operators ) in loop models .",
    "there are deep aspects to this , some of which will be discussed here but mostly in subsequent work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . at the end of this introduction",
    ", we provide a summary of our results .",
    "section 2 contains crucial algebraic preliminaries , where we define and study in particular the two - boundary temperley - lieb algebra .",
    "section 3 contains coulomb gas calculations where , thanks to a realization of the boundary algebras involving injection of charge on the boundaries , we are able to calculate a subset of all the critical exponents of interest .",
    "this is deeply related with the version of the problem involving xxz chains with boundary fields that we also discuss briefly .",
    "section 4 is the main section .",
    "combining exact knowledge about hidden degeneracies ( that come in part from the algebraic analysis in section 2see also @xcite ) , coulomb gas arguments , and an educated guess on the structure of boundary states , we are able to propose a formula for the most general , seven parameters dependent partition function . section 5 contains various combinatorial applications , and a review of the few cases previsouly known , which our formulas all recover . in section 6",
    "we present a new combinatorial application , in the form of certain refined crossing formulae for critical percolation .",
    "finally , section 7 gives our conclusions    [ [ summary - of - the - results ] ] summary of the results : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this article we study a dense loop model on the annulus . because of the boundaries and the non - trivial topology of the annulus , there are several types of loops , depending both on its homotopy ( contractible or not ) and which boundaries ( none , only left , only right , or both ) it touches .",
    "we distinguish all these kinds of loops by giving them different boltzmann weights . for convenience",
    "we always ask the number of non - contractible lines to be even .",
    "this restriction will appear more clearly by defining the model on a lattice in the following section .",
    "a. b.    this model is endowed with conformal invariance , so we expect its partition function to be invariant under any conformal mapping .",
    "in particular we can study the model on a periodic strip of size @xmath6 ( @xmath7 in the periodic direction ) , related to the annulus @xmath8 by @xmath9 the geometry is characterized by the modular parameter @xmath10 where @xmath11 . as a consequence of conformal invariance , the partition function must depend on the boltzmann weights of the loops and on the modular parameter @xmath12 only .",
    "it is a well - known result that the central charge of the dense loop gas is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is related to the boltzmann weight of the bulk loops @xmath0 through @xmath15 note that @xmath14 is not restricted to be an integer .",
    "let us also recall the kac formula @xmath16 ^ 2 - 1}{4 m ( m+1)}. \\label{kac}\\ ] ]    .loop weights and their parametrizations .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these values could presumably be verified by numerical simulations in a square geometry .",
    "in this article we have studied a densely packed loop model on the annulus , with general loop weights that distinguish the two boundaries and the homotopy class of the loops .",
    "the main result is the exact seven - parameter continuum limit partition function ( [ superguess ] ) .",
    "we have verified that a range of special cases of this expression agree with existing results in the literature , and used it to derive new refined crossing probabilities in critical percolation .      * distinguishing both rims of the annulus by non - trivial boundary conditions is related with properties of @xmath17 boundary condition changing operators . resulting fusion rules are encoded in the result ( [ superguess ] ) .",
    "an intriguing  and to our knowledge novel ",
    "feature is that the fusion here depends on a parameter @xmath18 which is unrelated to those characterizing the two individual @xmath17 operators . *",
    "specializing the two - boundary model to simpler cases gives rise to a rich hierarchy of restrictions .",
    "for instance , the two - boundary model with @xmath19 and @xmath20 becomes the one - boundary model , and with @xmath21 this in turn becomes the standard ( `` zero - boundary '' ) temperley - lieb model .",
    "moreover , in each case there are `` magical '' values of the weights , typically corresponding to one of the @xmath22-type parameters taking an integer value .",
    "each of these restrictions corresponds to the disappearence of some of the states in the transfer matrix , the vanishing of certain eigenvalue amplitudes , and the reorganization of the hilbert space into new modules .",
    "there is a rich algebraic meaning of this truncation hierarchy .",
    "* the present work pertains to the dense phase of the o(@xmath0 ) model . in the dilute case",
    "the possibilities are richer : in addition to the boundary - specific @xmath0-type weights , one can weigh differently the boundary monomers depending on the type of loop to which they belong .",
    "this gives rise to several surface transitions .",
    "some of those will be insensitive to the values of the @xmath22-type parameters , others will correspond to the usual swapping of indices ( i.e. , @xmath23 in the kac formula ) , and yet others lead to genuinely new behaviour .",
    "we thank j.  cardy , i.  kostov , r.  nepomechie and b.  nienhuis for helpful comments and for correspondence .",
