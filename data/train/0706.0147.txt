    "due to their large dipole moments @xcite , rydberg atoms experience strong long - range dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "these interactions strongly mix and shift the multiply rydberg excited collective states of an atomic sample .",
    "this phenomenon has recently been put forward as the key ingredient of different promising atomic quantum processing scenarios .",
    "for instance , rydberg - rydberg interactions can be used to perform two - qubit logic operations in individual - atom systems by shifting a transition off resonance in an atom , depending on the internal state of another atom in its immediate neighbourhood @xcite . in a mesoscopic ensemble ,",
    "dipole - dipole interactions are able to inhibit transitions into collective states which contain more than one rydberg excitation , thus leading to the so - called rydberg blockade .",
    "first predicted in @xcite , this phenomenon was locally observed in laser cooled atomic systems @xcite and could in principle be used in the future to manipulate and entangle collective excitation states of mesoscopic ensembles of cold atoms @xcite .",
    "so far , the schemes based on rydberg - rydberg interactions have focused on the coupling between atoms excited into the same high energy state .",
    "typically , in these proposals , atoms in the sample are ( simultaneously or not ) excited to the same rydberg state @xmath3 .",
    "when the so - called frster process @xmath4 is resonant , the dipole - dipole interaction is enhanced : one can then diagonalize the dipole - dipole interaction operator @xmath5 in the subspace @xmath6 , which leads to shifted new eigenstates ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . in the present paper",
    ", we propose to investigate other settings in which atoms can be excited into several rydberg states of different @xmath7 s . in these configurations , @xmath5 mixes and shifts some of the several - atom states through frster - like processes , whereas it leaves the others unchanged : figuratively speaking , depending on the rydberg state they are excited into , atoms will _ see _ each other or not .",
    "this can be used to selectively hinder certain transitions into multiply rydberg excited states , while allowing for the others .",
    "this , in turn , leads to richer dynamical behaviours than considered in previous theoretical proposals . through exciting the information - carrying ground states of the atoms into properly chosen different rydberg states",
    ", one can for example induce conditional logic dynamics involving more than two qubits . to be more specific , in the present paper",
    ", we shall first focus on the dipole - dipole interactions which take place in a system of three hydrogen - like atoms submitted to different laser beams coupling their ground levels to different rydberg states @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "we shall carefully examine the interaction induced energy shifts and the resulting blockade of unwanted transitions , and in particular we shall show that the desired performance is satisfactorily met by rubidium atoms .",
    "we shall then demonstrate how to use this physical setting in order to perform non - trivial conditional logic operations involving three qubits of information stored either in a three - atom system or in mesoscopic ensembles , thus generalizing the pioneering work by lukin _ et al_. @xcite .",
    "let us consider a system of three identical hydrogen - like atoms , denoted @xmath11 .",
    "we let @xmath12 be the unperturbed hamiltonian of atom @xmath13 and @xmath14   \\label{dipdip}%\\ ] ] be the dipole - dipole interaction between atoms @xmath13 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the vector from nucleus @xmath17 to nucleus @xmath18 .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system then takes the form @xmath19 with @xmath20  and @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , with electronic states @xmath22 @xcite , one gets the general formula @xmath23 \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( see appendix [ appr ] for an explicit expression for @xmath26 ) . note that @xmath27 only if @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( dipole selection rules ) .    in our setting",
    ", the three atoms , initially prepared in the ground state @xmath30 , can be submitted to different ( sets of ) laser beams which couple @xmath31 to the rydberg states @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "population of states with arbitrary magnetic quantum numbers @xmath35 and @xmath36 is achieved through a proper choice of the polarization of the laser beams . if the dipole - dipole interaction were absent , the only populated three - atom states would be @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . the effect of @xmath5 on the ground state @xmath37 and the singly rydberg excited states is very small and we shall neglect it ; in contrast , @xmath5 strongly couples the doubly and triply rydberg excited states to the rest of the hilbert space .",
    "nevertheless , choosing @xmath45 in such a way that all the couplings listed in table [ tabrub ] are non - resonant , we shall assume that we can restrict ourselves to the two resonant couplings @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "note that , by virtue of selection rules , the states @xmath48 and @xmath49 , though resonant , are not coupled by @xmath5 .",
    "the applicability of the previous assumption will be discussed below and quantitative conditions for its validity will be identified . for now , let us assume these conditions are met : the state @xmath50 is then unaffected by @xmath5 ( in first order ) , whereas @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are shifted .",
    "the ( first order ) shifts can be calculated by diagonalizing @xmath5 in the three degenerate subspaces @xmath54{c}% \\left\\vert ns;np;nd\\right\\rangle , \\left\\vert np;nd;ns\\right\\rangle , \\left\\vert nd;ns;np\\right\\rangle , \\\\",

    "using eq.([eq2 ] ) and taking the selection rules into account , one derives the following expression for @xmath5 in @xmath57 : @xmath58{cc } 0 & m_{sp}^{\\dagger}\\\\ m_{sp } & 0 \\end{array } \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath59 is a @xmath60 matrix which contains coupling terms between @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the form @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "@xmath64 has six non - zero eigenvalues @xmath65 which do not depend on the geometric configuration of the system ( _ i.e. _ the angles and distances between the atoms ) .",
    "the corresponding energy shifts are given by @xmath66 .",
    "similar results can be established in @xmath67 : the energy shifts one obtains are non - zero and depend neither on distances nor on angles between atoms ; their norms take the values in the range @xmath68 .",
    "the case of @xmath69 is more complicated , since @xmath5 now involves both @xmath70 and @xmath71 couplings : @xmath72 thus can not be decomposed in as simple a way as @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the resulting eigenvalues will thus depend on the geometry of the three - atom system ( one angle- and two distance - variables , for instance ) . in principle",
    ", it is thus possible to find a specific arrangement so that one or more eigenvalues are null ; in the generic situation , however , all the eigenvalues and the associated energy shifts @xmath75 are non - zero . finally , @xmath76 prevent the states @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 from being populated through resonant laser excitation of @xmath77 , whereas all the other unshifted states , and in particular @xmath50 , are accessible . before addressing the physical implementation of this situation in a rubidium atom system ,",
    "let us turn back to the assumptions which allowed us to restrict ourselves to @xmath78 .",
    "these assumptions are legitimate when the second - order shifts induced by the non - resonant couplings shown in table [ tabrub ] are negligible compared to the first - order shifts obtained above . to make sure this",
    "is fulfilled , one has to verify that the smallest of the first - order shifts , within each subspace , @xmath79 , is much larger than the shifts obtained from the unwanted couplings .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath57 subspace , the following condition must hold : @xmath80 let us now see how the previous situation can be implemented in a rubidium atom system .",
    "assuming @xmath81 and @xmath82 with @xmath83 , we numerically checked both the non - resonance and the negligibility conditions eq.([neglcond ] ) for the unwanted couplings listed in table [ tabrub ] .",
    "then we calculated the dipole - dipole interaction induced shifts in the three degenerate subspaces @xmath57 , @xmath67 and @xmath69 , using @xmath84 and @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the bohr radius @xmath87 , which yielded     .relevant states and unwanted couplings . [ cols=\"<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "if the rabi frequencies of the laser beams remain small compared to these shifts ( here , typically , @xmath91 ) the excitation of the corresponding states will be blocked .",
    "conversely it puts a lower bound of the order of @xmath92 for the typical time duration of single atom operations .",
    "let us now see how to use the spectroscopic situation described in the previous section in order to induce conditional dynamics in individual atom systems . to be specific , here , we show how to implement a three - qubit toffoli gate @xcite in the three - atom system considered above .",
    "a qubit of information is encoded in each of the three atoms on the ground state @xmath93  and a low - lying excited state @xmath94 , the rydberg states will be only temporarily populated during the gate , to achieve conditional dynamics through dipole - dipole interaction induced shifts ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "atoms @xmath95 will respectively play the roles of control 1- @xmath96 , target- @xmath97 and control 2-qubits @xmath98 .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig2.eps    the toffoli gate is then implemented through the following three - step procedure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "a. one first submits control atoms @xmath96 and  @xmath99 to @xmath100-laser pulses which couple @xmath101 to @xmath102 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "b. one successively applies three @xmath103-laser pulses on the target atom @xmath104 which couple @xmath105 to @xmath9 , @xmath106 to @xmath9 and @xmath101 to @xmath9 , respectively ( in the absence of the control atoms , this boils down to performing the pauli matrix @xmath107 in the computational basis @xmath108 ) .",
    "c. one repeats the first step .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig3.eps    if ( at least ) one of the atoms @xmath96 and  @xmath109 is initially in the state @xmath105 , at the end of step a , ( at least ) one of the states @xmath102 and @xmath110 is excited : the shift induced by the dipole - dipole interaction between @xmath104 and @xmath111 and/or  @xmath99 will then prevent the target atom from being excited into the state @xmath9 , _",
    "i.e. _ step b will not induce any change .",
    "in contrast , if both @xmath96 and  @xmath99 are initially in @xmath112 , no interaction will shift the state @xmath113 , step b will thus result in a @xmath107 gate on the target atom .",

    "note that , even though the same result can be achieved through combining one- and two- qubit elementary gates , our proposal only involves three steps and thus constitutes a more economical implementation of the toffoli gate .",
    "the same kind of conditional dynamics can also be performed on qubits stored in mesoscopic ensembles . to be specific , here",
    ", we shall show how to perform a ccphase gate in an ensemble made of the same atoms as in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "in addition to the ground state @xmath116 and rydberg states @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , we shall need three extra long - lived atomic states @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 ( see fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , we encode three qubits of information on the eight collective states @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 where @xmath131  ( for instance ) denotes the symmetric collective state with one atom in @xmath132 and another in @xmath133 .    [ ptb ]    fig4.eps    the following three - step procedure implements the desired ccphase gate .",

    ". b. one then applies a @xmath142-pulse on the ensemble which couple @xmath143 to @xmath144 . the pulse will cause a transition in the ensemble only if none of the rydberg levels @xmath102 and @xmath145 are excited : it follows that only the state @xmath146 will be multiplied by @xmath147 , the other states being left unchanged .",
    "c. finally , one applies the same two @xmath100 laser pulses as in the first step , which induces the inverse transformations .",
    "the overall transformation is thus a ccphase , which imposes a @xmath148 gate on the target qubit initially stored in the @xmath149 ensemble _ iff _ the control ensembles @xmath150  and @xmath151  are initially in state @xmath105 .",
    "in this paper , we proposed new configurations for dipole - dipole rydberg interactions , involving different coupled and non - coupled rydberg states . we think that such configurations are very promising and should allow for efficient implementation of sophisticated conditional dynamics beyond two - qubit gates . as first examples",
    ", we showed how to perform two specific three - qubit gates ( the ccnot and ccphase gates ) in an individual atom system and in an atomic ensemble , through appropriately exciting atoms into three different rydberg states .",
    "the feasibility of our schemes has been verified for the specific example of rubidium atoms.we are currently investigating how such configurations with different rydberg states could contribute , on the one hand , to extend the blockade phenomenon to macroscopic ensembles , and , on the other hand , to solve grid games as latin squares quantum - mechanically .",
