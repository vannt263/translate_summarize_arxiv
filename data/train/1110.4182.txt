    "quantum many - body states , which have long been central research objects in condensed matter physics , statistical physics , and quantum chemistry , are now attracting the renewed interest in quantum information science as fundamental resources for quantum information processing .",
    "one of the most celebrated examples is one - way quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "once the highly - entangled many - body state which is called the cluster state is prepared , universal quantum computation is possible with adaptive local measurements on each qubit .",
    "recently , the concept of quantum computational tensor network ( qctn )  @xcite , which is the general framework of measurement - based quantum computation on quantum many - body states , was proposed .",
    "this novel framework has enabled us to understand how general measurement - based quantum computation is performed on many other resource states beyond the cluster state .",
    "the most innovative feature of qctn is that the resource state is represented in a tensor - network form ( or a matrix - product form )  @xcite , and universal quantum computation is performed in the virtual linear space where tensors live .",
    "for example , let us consider the one - dimensional open - boundary chain of @xmath0 qudits in the matrix - product form @xmath1 ... a[k_1]|r\\rangle    \\label{mps}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the normalization factor , @xmath3\\rho a^\\dagger[i]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is a map , @xmath4 is a certain basis in the @xmath5-dimensional hilbert space ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are @xmath9-dimensional complex vectors , and @xmath10, ... ,a[d-1]\\}$ ] are @xmath11 complex matrices .",

    "this virtual linear space is called the correlation space  @xcite .",
    "the core of qctn is this  virtual quantum computation \" in the correlation space .",
    "if the correlation space has a sufficient structure and if @xmath29 s , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are appropriately chosen , we can  simulate \" universal quantum circuit in the correlation space  @xcite .    for the realization of a scalable quantum computer , a theory of fault - tolerant ( ft ) quantum computation  @xcite is necessary .",
    "in fact , several researches have been performed on ft quantum computation in the one - way model  @xcite .",
    "however , there has been no result about a theory of ft quantum computation on general qctn  @xcite .",
    "in particular , there is severe lack of knowledge about ft quantum computation on resource states with @xmath30 .",
    "it is necessary to consider resource states with @xmath30 if we want to enjoy the cooling preparation of a resource state and the energy - gap protection of measurement - based quantum computation with a physically natural hamiltonian , since no genuinely entangled qubit state can be the unique ground state of a two - body frustration - free hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "one straightforward way of implementing ft quantum computation on qctn is to encode physical qudits with a quantum error correcting code : @xmath31 ...",
    "a[k_1]|r\\rangle    @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the encoded version of @xmath34 ( such as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , etc . ) in fact , this strategy was taken in refs .",
    "@xcite for the one - way model @xmath37 , and it was shown there that a ft construction of the encoded cluster state is possible . for @xmath30 , however , such a strategy is difficult , since theories of quantum error correcting codes and ft preparations of the encoded resource state @xmath38 are less developed for @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , if we encode physical qudits with a quantum error correcting code , the parent hamiltonian should no longer be two - body interacting one .",
    "the other way of implementing ft quantum computation on qctn is to simulate ft quantum circuits in the correlation space . since any unitary operation , state preparation , and the projective measurement in the computational basis can be simulated in a correlation space ( for a more precise discussion about the possibility of the measurement ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it is natural to expect that ft quantum circuits can also be simulated in a correlation space .",
    "an advantage of this strategy is that theories of ft quantum circuits for qubit systems are well developed  @xcite .",
    "in fact , this strategy was taken in refs .",
    "@xcite for the one - way model @xmath37 .",
    "they introduced a method ( which we call  the ensemble method \" since the ensemble of all measurement results are considered ) of simulating quantum circuits in the correlation space of the cluster state , and showed that all physical errors on physical qubits can be linear completely - positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) maps in the correlation space of the cluster state .",
    "this means that ft quantum circuits can be simulated in the correlation space of the cluster state .    in this paper , however , we point out that it is not so straightforward to simulate ft quantum circuits in a correlation space of a general resource state . in the next section , sec .",

    "however , we show a general theorem that such an another way does neither work if @xmath30 .    in short , we show in this paper that it is not so straightforward to simulate ft quantum circuits in the correlation space of a general resource state .",
    "since all errors behave nicely in the correlation space of the cluster state  @xcite , less attention has been paid to the difference between a real physical space and a correlation space of a general resource state .",
    "our results here suggest that these two spaces can be different , and because of the difference , simulations of ft quantum circuits can be difficult in a correlation space . of course , we do not show here the impossibility of making a qctn fault - tolerant . in a future , a highly elaborated method might be found which makes all qctn fault - tolerant .",

    "[ hoge1 ] ( a-2 ) and ( b-2 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "such an  input - output \" picture seems to be impossible for the one - dimensional aklt state , because of the following two reasons : first , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ hoge2 ] left , no nearest - neighbour two - body unitary operation can decompose the one - dimensional aklt chain into two chains due to the existence of the non - vanishing two - point correlation in the aklt state .",
    "( if the one - dimensional aklt chain can be decomposed into two chains by such a unitary , it contradicts to the well - known fact that the two - point correlation is non - vanishing in the aklt state . )",
    "second , we can not deterministically implement a specific gate at a _ fixed _ site of the aklt chain irrespective of measurement results  @xcite . in short , the  input - output",
    "\" picture seems to be impossible for the aklt state .",
    "if we can no longer use the  input - output \" picture , it is not unreasonable that we have some anomalous maps in the correlation space since the correlation space is not a physical space but an abstract mathematical space .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , it is not always possible for general resource states to implement a specific gate at a fixed site of the resource state irrespective of measurement results .",
    "this fact prohibits a general resource state from allowing the  input - output \" picture",
    ". one might think that if we abandon such a deterministic  output \" at a fixed site for all measurement results , and if we just consider a specific history ( trajectory ) of measurement results , we might be able to avoid the emergence of non - cptp errors .",
