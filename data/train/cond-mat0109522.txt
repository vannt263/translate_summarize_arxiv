    "since @xmath6-wave symmetrical pairing of electrons was proposed , driven mainly by ferromagnetic spin fluctuations , in the 1.5 k superconductor sr@xmath7ruo@xmath8 @xcite , further superconducting phases have been expected in the vicinity of the 214 phase .",
    "this is probably due to substantial spin fluctuations found in neighboring compounds , including ferromagnetic srruo@xmath0 @xcite , and nearly ferromagnetic caruo@xmath0 @xcite and sr@xmath0ru@xmath7o@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "although intensive investigations have been applied to the ruthenium oxide systems , further ` @xmath6-wave ' superconducting phases have not been discovered thus far .",
    "the current experimental studies on ferromagnetically induced superconductivity , then , seem to be tied to a very local variety of materials . to ameliorate the stagnant situation ,",
    "we have been exploring other correlated @xmath10-metal compounds , not only to find further superconducting materials in the ruthenium oxide system , but also to expand the variety of potential chemical systems for the spin - fluctuations - induced superconductors .    the rhodium oxide perovskite srrho@xmath0 was recently found , and a pure polycrystalline sample was obtained by high - pressure synthesis techniques at 60 kbar and 1500 @xmath11c , followed by investigations of the magnetic susceptibility , electrical resistivity , and specific heat .",
    "the compound was fairly metallic and showed enhanced and thermally activated paramagnetism in the studied temperature range below 380 k. a qualitative fit of the curie - weiss ( cw ) law to the magnetic susceptibility data yielded a negative weiss temperature of -361 k , if the analysis provided a correct sense of the magnetism .",
    "neither superconductivity nor long range magnetic order was found above 1.8 k. the magnetic data for srrho@xmath0 appeared to be qualitatively similar to what was observed for the analogous ruthenium oxide metal caruo@xmath0 . since then",
    ", the self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) theory of spin fluctuations for both antiferro- and ferromagnetic nearly - ordered magnetic metals was tested on the observed electronic properties as was done for caruo@xmath0 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "all of the present data for srrho@xmath0 do not meet the quantitative expectations as predicted by the theory .",
    "variable composition precursors were prepared at sr : rh = 1:3 , 1:2 , and 1:1 as follows .",
    "mixtures of pure srco@xmath0 ( 99.9 % ) and rh ( 99.9 % ) powders were heated in oxygen at 1000 @xmath11c overnight , and then ground well and reheated in oxygen at 1200 @xmath11c for two days @xcite .",
    "one and two moles of sro@xmath7 ( @xmath1299.9 % ) were added to the 1:2 and 1:3 precursors per the formula , respectively , and 8 wt.% of kclo@xmath8 to the 1:1 precursor . those were mixed well , and approximately 0.2 g of each were placed into pt capsules . those were heated at 60 kbar and",
    "1500 @xmath11c for 1 hr , then quenched to room temperature before releasing the pressure @xcite .",
    "quality of the finally obtained pellets was studied by powder x - ray - diffraction techniques in a regular manner .",
    "it was determined from the x - ray readings that the major phase was of perovskite - type .",
    "the position and intensity distribution of the peaks for the phase were invariable among the patterns for every sample .",
    "the impurity level was 1 % or less in every final production except kcl .",
    "the perovskite - type phase denoted srrho@xmath0 , of which no records were found thus far in the literature .",
    "further structural characterization was made for the selected sample , which was prepared from the 1:2 precursor and sro@xmath7 , by x - ray rietveld technique ( cu@xmath13 ) using the program rietan-2000 @xcite .",
    "a distorted perovskite structure model , gdfeo@xmath0-type , was tested and found reasonable to describe the structure of srrho@xmath0 .",
    "the x - ray powder pattern and crystal structure are indicated in fig.[xrd ] ; space group was @xmath14 ( no .",
    "62 ) and lattice parameters were @xmath15 5.5394(2 )  , @xmath16 7.8539 ( 3 )  , and @xmath17 5.5666(2 )  .",
    "the estimated positions for the atoms were sr(0.0304(1 ) , 0.25 , -0.0054(8 ) ) , rh(0 , 0 , 0.5 ) , o1(0.4990(23 ) , 0.25 , 0.0587(45 ) ) , and o2(0.2825(26 ) , 0.0366(24 ) , 0.7088(26 ) ) . during the refinement ,",
    "the occupation factors , and the isotropic displacement parameters of the metals and oxygen were fixed at 1 , 0.3 , and 0.7 , respectively .",
    "the final reliability factors and goodness of fit to the analysis were @xmath1820.9 % , @xmath1914.41 % , @xmath2018.57 % , and @xmath21 1.53 .",
    "oxygen vacancies in the perovskite were quantitatively investigated in detail by thermogravimetric analysis and found to be insignificant @xcite .",
    "the same sample was again selected for characterization by magnetic , specific heat , and electrical resistivity measurements .",
    "the temperature dependence of magnetization was measured in a quantum design mpms magnetometer .",
    "the specific heat and the electrical resistivity data were obtained in a quantum design ppms apparatus .",
    "those measurements were conducted between 1.8 and 400 k. the highest applied magnetic field was 70 koe .",
    "temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of polycrystalline srrho@xmath0 is shown in fig.[resistivity ] .",
    "the data were obtained by a standard 4-terminal dc technique at a current of 5 ma on a piece of the sample pellet .",
    "the data clearly reveal the metallic nature of srrho@xmath0 ; a metallic temperature dependence and @xmath5 1.3 m@xmath22 cm at room temperature are typical for polycrystalline oxide metals .",
    "the low temperature part ( @xmath450 k ) is expanded and replotted as @xmath23 vs @xmath24 ( inset in fig.[resistivity ] ) .",
    "the observed linear dependence is indicative of fermi liquid behavior for srrho@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "subsequent fitting studies with standard resistivity expression for a fermi liquid ( @xmath25 ) yielded @xmath26 142 @xmath27 cm and @xmath28 0.062 @xmath27cm / k@xmath29 .",
    "the unusually large @xmath30 probably reflects contributions from extrinsic origins such as grain boundaries .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 was not constant among the sets of resistivity data for all of the present pellets ( approximately two magnitudes larger for the pellet containing kcl ) , while the residual resistivity ratio , @xmath31 , remained almost constant ( @xmath5 9 ) among them . at the magnetic instability point , or in the extreme vicinity of that point",
    ", the electrical resistivity is not expected to obey the famous @xmath24 law due to the influence of spin fluctuations ; i.e. @xmath32 and @xmath33 law may be obeyed by antiferro- and ferromagnetically unstable 3d metals , respectively .",
    "detailed analysis was preliminarily applied for the present resistivity data , however , the non - fermi liquid behavior was not clearly seen .",
    "magnetoresistivity at 1.8 k between -70 and 70 koe was not observed , and may be due to polycrystalline nature of the sample .",
    "additional studies using a single crystal srrho@xmath0 , if it becomes available , could allow us to exclude the extrinsic contributions and then might help to reveal the intrinsic nature of electrical resistivity of srrho@xmath0 . because the 4@xmath1-band in srrho@xmath0 is expected to be broad , as is the case for srruo@xmath0 , 4@xmath1-electrons in the rhodium oxide should be itinerate by analogy @xcite .",
    "the observed metallic conductivity is , hence , reflecting mainly the nature of unlocalized 4@xmath1 electrons .",
    "the perovskite srrho@xmath0 could be in a class of the itinerant 4@xmath1-electron systems , such as ( sr , ca)ruo@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "further investigations into the electronic transport of srrho@xmath0 , including band structure calculations , would be of interest .",
    "magnetic data are summarized in fig.[magnetic ] .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility of srrho@xmath0 obviously depends on temperature and is approximately 1.1@xmath34 emu / mol - rh at room temperature , in contrast with the properties of the pauli paramagnetic rhodium metal ( approximately one magnitude smaller and almost temperature independent ) @xcite .",
    "a steep rise in the @xmath35 vs @xmath36 plot in low temperature at 10 koe was observed , while it was significantly suppressed at 50 koe .",
    "the @xmath37 vs @xmath38 curve at 2 k ( inset in fig.[magnetic ] ) indicates a subtle spontaneous magnetic moment ( @xmath5 0.001 @xmath39 per rh ) , suggesting srrho@xmath0 has ordered magnetic moments .",
    "after subtraction of the major part , @xmath40 vs @xmath36 plot results in a standard cw line with an insignificant level of weiss temperature @xmath5 -1.5 k @xcite .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to conclude that the upturn results from a magnetic impurity origin rather than an ordered state of srrho@xmath0 .",
    "the slightly positive curvature of the @xmath37 vs @xmath38 curve at 2 k is probably due to superimposing the small amount of impurity component on the major part .    to further analyze the major part of the magnetic data for srrho@xmath0",
    ", two plots of the reciprocal magnetic susceptibility were prepared in the forms of @xmath41 vs @xmath36 and @xmath41 vs @xmath24 without any other manipulations except subtraction of sample holder contribution ( fig.[magnetic2 ] ) .",
    "it is clearly seen in the temperature range that @xmath41 is proportional to @xmath24 rather than proportional to @xmath36 as expected from the standard cw expression .",
    "alternatively , the cw law with a temperature - independent term , i.e. @xmath42 $ ] ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the curie constant and weiss temperature , respectively ) , was applied to the @xmath41 vs @xmath36 plot .",
    "the fit , however , failed to produce a convincible result @xcite .",
    "tentative cw parameters obtained in the calculations were considerably sensitive to least squares fitting conditions , including temperature range width , and stable and reasonable solutions were never found .",
    "further attempts were made to demonstrate the implied linear relationship between @xmath41 and @xmath24 for srrho@xmath0 .",
    "neither the @xmath45 nor the @xmath46 fit ( data not shown ) , however , yielded a linear part , which was expected , if srrho@xmath0 was just at the magnetic instability point @xcite .",
    "the above experimental observations would suggest that the magnetic susceptibility for srrho@xmath0 is rather uncommon among properties of magnetic metals , because many antiferro- and ferromagnetic metals are expected to follow approximately the cw law above the magnetic ordering temperature or 0 k ( in the case for nearly ordered metals ) @xcite .",
    "the roughly estimated @xmath47 @xmath48/mol for srrho@xmath0 , and the sommerfeld constant discussed later ( @xmath49 mj / mol k@xmath29 ) , yielded the wilson ratio ( @xmath50 ) of @xmath5 8.6 using the formula @xcite , @xmath51 the preliminary @xmath50 for srrho@xmath0 is clearly out of the expected range , 1 to 2 , for standard fermi - liquid behavior .",
    "the unreliable @xmath50 might support the presence of peculiar magnetism in srrho@xmath0 .",
    "the most advanced profiling thus far achieved for the nearly and weakly antiferro- and ferromagnetic 3d metals was accomplished by developing the scr theory of spin fluctuations in metals @xcite . at the paramagnetic region , @xmath41 is expected to be in direct proportion to the @xmath1th power of @xmath36 , where @xmath521 to 3/2 and 1 to 4/3 for antiferro- and ferromagnetic 3d metals , respectively @xcite .",
    "this is the most notable point to distinguish the progress of understanding in magnetism of metals achieved by the scr studies , and so - far observations , indeed , seem to be in the range ( @xmath53 ) @xcite .",
    "the rather conventional stoner s model ( @xmath54 ) is far beyond the range .",
    "the rhodium oxide metal , however , shows a nearly @xmath24 dependence of @xmath41 , which ironically matches the stoner expectation @xcite . although the @xmath24 trend in @xmath41 was also predicted by a random phase approximation theory , using it here to analyze the present data may be problematic , because it is too limited in temperature range ( only effective within extremely low temperature ) , due to mainly a lack of self consistency @xcite .",
    "further considerations with additional studies may be necessary to conclusively determine the microscopic origin of the @xmath54 trend in srrho@xmath0 .",
    "the specific heat data are presented in fig.[cp ] . a standard relaxation technique",
    "was employed in measurement .",
    "the temperature dependence of the specific heat ( @xmath55 ) of srrho@xmath0 measured between 1.8 and 390 k is plotted in the inset of the top panel in fig.[cp ] after subtraction of a contribution from the addenda .",
    "the difference between @xmath55 and @xmath56 was assumed insignificant in the temperature range studied .",
    "the top main panel shows a @xmath57 vs @xmath24 plot of the data below 20 k. as expected within the debye approximation , a linear dependence is clearly seen .",
    "the estimated debye temperature was 190 k and the sommerfeld constant was 7.6 mj / mol k@xmath29 by a least squares fitting as indicated by the dotted line in fig.[cp ] . among fermi",
    "liquid metals , a universality was found in @xmath58 . a tentative calculation of @xmath58 with the obtained parameters for srrho@xmath0",
    ", @xmath59 7.6 mj / mol k@xmath29 and @xmath28 0.062 @xmath27cm / k@xmath29 , produced an incredible result , a value approximately two magnitudes larger than the universal constant .",
    "the parameter @xmath60 for srrho@xmath0 perhaps involves extrinsic contributions somewhat as @xmath30 dose .",
    "we decided , therefore , not to make further quantitative analysis for @xmath58 of srrho@xmath0 . on the other hand",
    ", we found that the debye temperature of srrho@xmath0 is much lower than those of the ruthenium oxide perovskites @xcite .",
    "this fact would indicate the lattice of srrho@xmath0 is much ` softer ' than that of the ruthenium oxide perovskites .",
    "as expected from the debye temperature , even within the studied temperature range , it can be clearly seen that the specific heat is approaching the roughly expected value @xmath5 125 mj / mol k [ 5(atoms per unit cell)@xmath613 ( dimensionality per atom ) @xmath62n(boltzmann and avogadro s constants ) ]",
    ".    in the low temperature portion of the specific heat data , an extra contribution ( @xmath63 ) appears , as @xmath57 starts to part gradually from the linear dependence on cooling .",
    "it is presumably magnetic in origin and is found in a variety of itinerant magnetic materials @xcite .",
    "the probable magnetic term was extracted by subtracting the lattice contribution and the sommerfeld constant from the original data , which is shown in the bottom panel of fig.[cp ] . at first",
    ", the @xmath64 data was quantitatively investigated with a component for spin fluctuations in the scr framework for nearly ferromagnetic metals @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the spin fluctuations to the specific heat was approximated by @xmath65 , \\label{cmt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the number of magnetic atoms , @xmath67 is the first derivative of the digamma function , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the parameters as to spin fluctuations , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the expression was then reduced to the following form in the low temperature limit : @xmath73 .",
    "\\label{cmt2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for fitting purposes by a least squares method , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath74 were set as independent variable parameters in the first two terms in eq.[cmt2 ] , where @xmath75 was replaced by @xmath76 .",
    "the best fitting result is shown in the bottom panel of fig.[cp ] as a broken curve . although the observed data , @xmath64 vs @xmath36 , were reproduced at a convincible level , all of the parameters determined here , @xmath77 0.00305 k , @xmath78 3.69 and @xmath79 26.7 k were , however , incredible @xcite .",
    "for example , the tentatively obtained values do not satisfy the form @xmath80 at all . as dictated by eq.[cmt2 ] , there were no other combinations of the parameters that fit the data .",
    "these facts , therefore , suggest that the contribution from spin fluctuations in nearly ferromagnetic metals is either unlikely or at least insufficient to account for the observed @xmath81 in srrho@xmath0 .",
    "in 3d nearly antiferromagnetic metals , magnetic contributions to the specific heat in the scr framework have been studied ; an enhancement of @xmath82 is expected at low temperature instead of the parameters in eq.[cmt2 ] @xcite .",
    "the 3d nearly antiferromagnetic picture is , therefore , unlikely to explain the observed @xmath81 for srrho@xmath0 .",
    "the structure and electronic properties of a polycrystalline sample of srrho@xmath0 obtained by high - pressure synthesis techniques was investigated .",
    "although the polycrystalline nature of the sample limited quantitatively detailed analysis of the electrical resistivity properties , the present data strongly suggests the perovskite is in the category of a fermi liquid .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility of srrho@xmath0 was found to follow a rather unusual temperature dependence , i.e. @xmath54 . the tentative attempt of quantitative analysis using 3d spin fluctuation models resulted in inconvincible results for the magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat data .",
    "although the major contribution to the enhancement of the paramagnetism of srrho@xmath0 might result from a seizable density of state at fermi level , as in ( sr , ca)ruo@xmath0 @xcite , it is not sufficient to explain the entire magnetic behavior of srrho@xmath0 , because it is temperature - independent .",
    "there are likely additional factors which account for the temperature dependent portion of the magnetism with the @xmath54 trend .",
    "the character of the paramagnetism of srrho@xmath0 seems to be intermediate between that of enhanced pauli- and cw - type paramagnetism .",
    "while extensive studies were made on paramagnon contributions for the cw paramagnetism in the vicinity of the critical point , the intermediate paramagnetism was essentially uninvestigated .",
    "whether the rhodium oxide 3d metal tends toward either an antiferro- or ferromagnetic instability point , the imposing appearance of the distinctive @xmath24 term in @xmath41 indicates that the magnetic excitation of 4@xmath1 electrons in srrho@xmath0 remains highly elusive .",
    "further investigations into srrho@xmath0 , including theoretical consideration , would be of significant interest .",
