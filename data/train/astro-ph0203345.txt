    "m74 ( ngc 628 ) is an sa(s)c galaxy , seen almost face - on ( inclination angle @xmath3@xmath4 , shostak and van der kruit 1984 ) at a distance of 9.7 mpc ( tully 1988 ) .",
    "it was observed by _ xmm - newton _  on 2002 february 2 , four days after the discovery of sn 2002ap ( nakano 2002 ) in the galaxy . in this letter , we present the first results ( including the luminosity function of x - ray sources , discovery of several luminous x - ray transients and the uv and x - ray counterparts of sn 2002ap ) from this observation .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  instrument modes were full - frame , thin filter for the three epic cameras , and the uvw1 filter for the om .",
    "the full time interval of the epic exposure is 34  ks . after rejecting intervals with a high background level",
    ", we considered a good time interval of 28  ks for our study .",
    "the exposure time for om is 2.5  ks .",
    "the data were extracted and analyzed with the sas version 5.2 .",
    "we also compared our _ xmm - newton _  observations with two _ chandra _  observations taken on 2001 june 19 and 2001 october 19 .",
    "the exposure time of both _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations is about 47 ks .",
    "a full analysis of the _ chandra _  data will be presented in a paper currently in preparation .",
    "twenty - one sources are detected by _ xmm - newton_/pn within 5  from the galactic nucleus ( not including a couple of sources coincident with foreground stars . )",
    "eighteen of those sources were also found by _",
    "chandra _   in 2001",
    "( one of them is in fact resolved into a close pair of sources by _ chandra _ ) . however , three sources were not , and are likely to be transient .",
    "the completeness limit for the pn sources is @xmath5 cts s@xmath6 in the 0.214 kev band . assuming a power - law spectrum with @xmath7 and column density @xmath8 @xmath9 , this corresponds to a flux of @xmath10 , and an emitted luminosity of @xmath11 .",
    "some of the 21 sources found inside the inner 5  may be background agn , seen through the disk of the galaxy , and therefore highly extincted .",
    "we can estimate the relative contribution of background sources by using the number counts from the _ chandra _  deep field north survey ( brandt et al .",
    "2001 ) in the 28 kev band ( where absorption is not important ) .",
    "we obtain that about half of the sources should be attributed to the background , at the completeness limit for the pn in the 28 kev band ( flux of @xmath12 ) .",
    "we can estimate the minimum total column density of hydrogen that would be between us and a background agn , and use the observed hardness ratios to decide which sources are more likely to belong to the galaxy . by combining ( shostak & van der kruit 1984 ) and co ( adler & liszt 1989 ) radio observations , and using a standard co - to - h@xmath13 conversion factor ( bloemen et al .",
    "1986 ) , we infer that the total column density @xmath14@xmath15 goes from @xmath16 @xmath9 in the inner 30  to @xmath17 @xmath9 at a distance of 4 , and @xmath18 @xmath9 at 5 . to this , we need to add a foreground galactic column density @xmath19 @xmath9 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "hence , we expect that background agn would be seen through a total column density @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath9 .",
    "defining as s and h the pn count rates in the ( 0.21.5 ) and ( 1.514 ) kev bands respectively , we obtain hardness ratios hr @xmath22 ( h@xmath23s)/(h@xmath24s ) for the detected sources . for a source with a power - law spectrum with @xmath7 , typical of an agn , hr @xmath25 if @xmath26 @xmath9 , and hr @xmath27 if @xmath28 @xmath9",
    ". we have therefore taken hr @xmath29 as an empirical criterion to identify sources very likely to belong to m74 , while we can not tell whether harder sources are background agn or highly absorbed m74 objects .",
    "nine of the 12 brightest sources detected with pn have hr @xmath29 , hence we conclude that they are genuine m74 objects .",
    "figure 1 shows the cumulative luminosity function log[n(@xmath30s)]log s for all the sources , and for the 9 sources with a most likely galactic origin .",
    "the latter curve can be fitted with a simple power law of index @xmath0 .",
    "this is similar to the slope at the high - luminosity end of the luminosity function for the disk population in spiral galaxies such as m81 ( tennant et al .",
    "2001 ) and m101 ( pence et al .",
    "2001 ) . we shall present a detailed discussion of the position , luminosity and hardness ratios of all _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _   sources in a forthcoming paper .",

    "energy spectra were extracted with the sas task xmmselect and were analyzed with xspec version 11 .",
    "we extracted data in pn from a circle of @xmath36  centered on the source , and the background from an annulus with inner and outer radii of @xmath37  and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "for the mos images , in which the source is near the chip boundary , we took two source - free regions ( @xmath39  radius each ) near the source for the background . in order to allow @xmath40 statistics to be used",

    "we fitted the pn and mos2 data simultaneously with several spectral models : power - law , black - body @xmath24 power - law , thermal bremsstrahlung , disk blackbody , and the bmc comptonisation model , in all cases with interstellar absorption .",
    "all models provide statistically acceptable fits to the data ( @xmath40 1 ; table 1 ) .",
    "the single power - law model yields a somewhat high column density compared to the values ( foreground galactic plus intrinsic ) expected at that galactic radius .",
    "in contrast , the disk blackbody model ( mitsuda et al .  1984 ) , and the bmc model ( shrader & titarchuk 1999 ) provide lower values of @xmath20 . physically , the comptonization model represents a two - component spectrum , with a soft blackbody component from the accretion disk and a power - law tail at higher energies , produced by inverse - compton scattering of the soft photons by high - energy electrons .",
    "the best - fitting bmc model is shown in figure  2 .",
    "neither the bmc nor the blackbody @xmath24 power - law fits can simultaneously constrain the column density and the temperature of the thermal component .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of 1 is significantly above the eddington limit for a @xmath42 accreting neutron star ( @xmath43 ) . with the disk - blackbody model ,",
    "the best - fitting parameters of @xmath44 kev and @xmath45 km imply a 0.38 kev luminosity of about @xmath46 .",
    "the bmc model yields an emitted luminosity of @xmath47 .",
    "there is another bright x - ray transient at r.a .",

    "@xmath22 15@xmath345005 ( j2000 ) ; it was not seen in either _ chandra _  observations .",
    "its spectrum can be well fitted with a simple power law with photon index of @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xmath9 .",
    "the emitted 0.38 kev luminosity is about @xmath50 , which makes it a likely stellar - mass black hole ( bh ) candidate . compared to galactic x - ray transients during outbursts , the spectrum of this source is relatively hard , although the errors are too large to constrain the exact spectral shape .",
    "hard x - ray transients are seen in other external galaxies such as m31 ( trudolyubov , borozdin , & priedhorsky 2001 ; kong et al .",
    "2002 ) and m81 ( ghosh et al .",
    "2001 ) .",

    "s@xmath6 , it is too faint for a spectral analysis . assuming a power - law spectrum with @xmath7 , and column density @xmath8 @xmath9 , its emitted luminosity is @xmath52 in the 0.214 kev band .",
    "the nucleus of the galaxy is detected at a count rate of @xmath53 cts s@xmath6 , which corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath54   for the assumed spectral model .",
    "finally , the x - ray counterpart of sn 2002ap ( nakano 2002 ) is detected at a count rate of @xmath55 cts s@xmath6 .",
    "( count rates in the two bands : s @xmath56 cts s@xmath6 ; h @xmath57 cts s@xmath6 ) .",

    "sn 2002ap is also clearly detected in the om image ( figure  3 ) .",
    "we measure a flux @xmath60 @xmath6 , at an effective wavelength of 291 nm , on mjd 52307.0153 .",
    "the cumulative luminosity function is a useful tool for studying populations of x - ray sources in galaxies . in some cases , it is a broken power - law , with a change in slope at luminosities varying between a few times @xmath61 and a few times @xmath62 . in other galactic environments ,",
    "the slope is constant from the detection limit to the high - luminosity end .",
    "a relation between the star - formation history of a galaxy and the evolution of its x - ray luminosity function has been proposed by wu ( 2001 ) and kilgard et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . assuming that the brightest x - ray sources also have the shortest life , the luminosity function develops a break at its bright end in the absence of ongoing star formation .",
    "this is usually the case in elliptical galaxies and in the bulges of spiral galaxies .",
    "the break evolves towards lower luminosities over time .",
    "an unbroken power - law shape can instead be sustained if the x - ray source population is continuously replenished by star formation processes , as is the case for example in the arms of spiral galaxies .    in this scenario ,",
    "the unbroken power - law luminosity function observed in the late - type spiral m74 is consistent with recent or ongoing star formation .",
    "previous optical and uv studies ( cornett et al .",
    "1994 ) have shown evidence for recent star formation in this galaxy , probably not uniformly across the disk .",
    "they have also shown that the optical / uv colors of m74 are intermediate between those of m33 ( bluest , with more recent star formation ) and of the m81 bulge ( with an older stellar population ) .",
    "a comparison between the luminosity functions of these three galaxies is left to a work in preparation .",
    "objects with an x - ray luminosity @xmath63@xmath64  are often called ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ; e.g. , makishima et al .",
    "2000 ; kaaret et al .",
    "2001 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "the x - ray spectra of ulxs are well described by a disk blackbody model ( see however strickland et al .",
    "2001 ) with @xmath65@xmath66 kev and @xmath67@xmath68 km .",
    "our disk - blackbody fit to the _ xmm - newton _  spectrum of 1 is in good agreement with these values . although some ulxs are highly variable on timescales of months or years ( e.g. , kubota et al . 2001 ; strickland et al .",
    "2001 ; la parola et al .",
    "2001 ) , they always remain at a high luminosity state ( @xmath69 ) . however , 1 is undetectable in the two deep _ chandra _",
    "observations few months before our _ xmm - newton _  observations , suggesting that the source was then below @xmath61 .",
    "the only transient ulx found so far is cxouj112015.8@xmath24133514 in ngc 3628 ( strickland et al .",
    "2001 ) , while 1 is the only example of an off - center ( @xmath70 or @xmath71 kpc from the galactic center ) transient ulx .",
    "the nature of ulxs is still a subject of debate .",
    "one common interpretation is that they are powered by accretion onto an intermediate - mass bh ( @xmath72@xmath73@xmath74 ; colbert & mushotzky 1999 ) .",
    "if the fitted spectral parameter @xmath75 ( color temperature of the disk - blackbody ) corresponds to the effective temperature @xmath76 at the inner boundary of a shakura - sunyaev disk , values of @xmath75 1 kev would be inconsistent with an intermediate - mass schwarzschild bh . either a rapidly - spinning bh ( makishima et al . 2000 ) or non - standard disk models ( e.g. , a `` slim disk '' ; watarai , mizuno , & mineshige 2001 ) would be required instead .",
    "however , it is more generally @xmath77 , where the `` hardening factor '' @xmath78 in some galactic microquasars ( ebisawa et al .",
    "2001 ; titarchuk & shrader 2002 ) . therefore , observed values @xmath79 kev do not rule out an intermediate - mass , non - rotating bh .",
    "an alternative scenario for persistent ulxs is based on anisotropic emission from more common intermediate- or high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "emission beamed towards us can produce the high x - ray fluxes observed in those systems ( king et al .",
    "2001 ) without the need for an intermediate - mass bh . for a transient system such as 1",
    ", further observations will tell us whether the brightening is due to a short - lived phase of super - eddington accretion , or to a state transition like those observed in some galactic microquasars ( groj165540 and grs1915 + 105 ) , which share similar spectral properties ( e.g. , makishima et al",
    ". 2000 ) .",
    "we tried to ascertain whether the ulx can be associated with a supernova remnant ( snr ) or a photoionized region , as found in some cases ( wang 2002 ) . from archival h@xmath80 images taken by the 1.0 m telescope at mount laguna observatory ( marcum et al .",
    "2001 ) , 1 is @xmath81  north - west of an extended region , and a point - like object is within the x - ray error circle ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "the point - like source appears more or less the same in both continuum - subtracted h@xmath80 images taken in 1991 and 1995 .",
    "optical spectroscopy of the extended region yields a ratio [ ] /h@xmath80 @xmath82 ( van zee et al .",
    "1998 ) , significantly lower than the typical value ( @xmath83 ) measured in snr ( e.g. , blair , kirshner , & chevalier 1981 ) .",
    "therefore , the extended h@xmath80 feature near 1 is likely a photoionized region associated with star formation .",
    "we inspected the uv image taken with om , simultaneously with the x - ray images .",
    "there is no obvious object within the x - ray error circle , to a limiting specific flux of @xmath84 @xmath6 , at an effective wavelength of 291 nm . as a comparison ,",
    "the specific flux from a single b0v star in m74 would be @xmath71 times fainter at the same effective wavelength .",
    "if the point - like source in the h@xmath80 image at the position of 1 corresponds to an ob star cluster , the lack of uv detection may be due to high extinction , typical of a very young star - forming cluster ( marcum et al .",
    "the larger region south - east of the transient is instead well visible in the om image ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the association with a young stellar population suggests that 1 is related to a high - mass x - ray binary .",
    "in addition , its strong variability ( @xmath85 ) indicates that it is an accreting compact object rather than a snr .",
    "further observations at different wavelengths will be necessary to shed light on the nature and timing properties of the source .",
    "we have studied the spiral galaxy m74 with _ xmm - newton_. the luminosity function above @xmath86   is well fitted by a single power law of slope @xmath0 , similar to the values found for the source population in the disks of other spiral galaxies .",
    "we interpret it as evidence of ongoing star formation in the disk .",
