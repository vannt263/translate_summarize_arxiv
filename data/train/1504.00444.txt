    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite is one of the most important developments in theoretical physics in recent years . because of the very nature of the duality , it also provides a promising new way of studying gauge theories in the strongly - coupled regime , where the usual perturbative methods fail to apply . the gauge / gravity duality has been used to gain insight in a wide variety of physical systems , such as the quark - gluon plasma or in condensed matter theory . in this last category ,",
    "the gauge / gravity duality has been fruitfully applied in the study of high-@xmath2 superconductivity , where the usual bcs model of cooper - pair creation ceases to be valid due to the strong interactions between the system s components .",
    "because of these non - trivial interactions , holographic methods are hoped to shed some light in the understanding of these systems .",
    "this area of study , known as _",
    "holographic superconductivity _ , is currently an exciting and very active area of research .",
    "( for some reviews , see , e.g. @xcite ) .    in very general terms , the usual models of holographic superconductivity are built around a local gauge group symmetry breaking by one of the component fields in the gravity side , where the gravitational solution is an asymptotically ads charged black hole .",
    "this symmetry breaking in the gravity side signals the beginning of a superconducting phase in the dual field theory .",
    "( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it has been found , however , that in some condensed matter systems phase transitions are governed by _ lifshitz - like fixed points_. these exhibit the particular anisotropic spacetime scaling symmetry @xmath3 where @xmath0 is the _ lifshitz dynamical critical exponent _ governing the degree of anisotropy .",
    "this anisotropy breaks lorentz invariance and the systems are non - relativistic in nature .",
    "therefore , in order to study such field theories holographically , the dual gravitational description has to be modified .",
    "indeed , it was found in @xcite that these lifshitz - like fixed points can be described by the gravitational dual @xmath4 which , for @xmath5 reduces back to the usual @xmath6 metric , but for @xmath7 satisfies the anisotropic scaling ( [ aniscaling ] ) .",
    "a black hole generalization of this metric was found in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this communication is to explore various aspects of holographic superconductivity with lifshitz - like fixed points , with a particular focus on magnetic phenomena .",
    "we do this by starting from a minimal bulk model and by studying various choices of condensates .",
    "more concretely , we want to investigate how the dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 affects our system with respect to its behavior in the isotropic @xmath5 case .",
    "most of the existing research on the subject was realized in @xmath8 .",
    "see , for instance @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors do make an interesting treatment of the @xmath9 case , but have their interest put mainly on studying different kinds of superconductors ( s - wave , p - wave , soliton ) and on the computation of condensation and conductivity . regarding the study of magnetic effects in a lifshitz background , we note in particular @xcite . in the first reference the authors also treat the @xmath9 case , but using a different condensate as the ones we will propose , and with a focus on the applicability of the matching method .",
    "although we will initially consider our minimal model in general dimensions , we will focus our attention on the @xmath9 case .",
    "the reason for this choice of dimension is that , as noted in @xcite , dimensionality plays an important role in the way external magnetic fields act in the dual superconducting system .",
    "the standard argument is that in a @xmath10 ( @xmath8 ) dimensional superconductor an external 3 + 1 dimensional magnetic field will always penetrate the material because the energy needed to expel the field scales as the volume , while the energy that the system gains from being in a superconducting state scales as the area .",
    "this results in the system being a type ii superconductor . in the case of a @xmath11 ( @xmath9 ) dimensional system such as the one we study , both energies scale as the volume and one has therefore a direct competition that does not excludes the possibility of obtaining a type i superconductor . also , while high-@xmath2 samples are typically composed of 2-dimensional @xmath12 layers ( _ cuprate superconductors _ ) , it is important to examine the effect of thickness when the system is probed by external magnetic fields .    in this respect , in this paper we see that it is possible to have a consistent ginzburg - landau phenomenological approach to holographic superconductivity @xcite in a lifshitz background .",
    "we then apply this ginzburg - landau approach to compute , among other physical quantities , the ginzburg - landau parameter of the system , and to see how it is affected by the dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "we will also study the effect of an external magnetic field acting directly on the system , using the approach proposed in @xcite . in order to have a more complete study of the system s properties",
    ", we managed to study a wide array of condensation cases , always within the @xmath9 framework , so that the general tendencies in the behavior of physical quantities become more clear .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our minimal model of @xmath9 holographic superconductivity with lifshitz dynamical scaling , and present the different cases of condensates we will consider . in section 3 , we study small fluctuations around the component fields of our model . from these fluctuations we are able to compute the penetration and correlation lengths of the superconductor for our different cases . in section 4",
    "we show that the system can be consistently described in a phenomenological ginzburg - landau approach .",
    "we compute the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath13 for the different cases in our model . in section 5",
    ", we compute the critical magnetic field @xmath14 of the superconductor .",
    "finally , in section 6 we summarize the main results and discuss some open problems .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the _",
    "d = d+2 _ gravitational dual ( [ kachru ] ) can be generalized to a black hole solution @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and where @xmath18 is the horizon of the black hole .",
    "the lifshitz dynamical critical exponent can take values @xmath19 .",
    "the gravitational solution ( [ pang ] ) can be obtained from the action @xcite @xmath20 with extremal solution for the fields @xmath21 for the remaining of the paper we will set @xmath22",
    ". we will also prefer to work with the coordinate @xmath23 .",
    "this change of coordinates gives @xmath24 where @xmath25 and the hawking temperature is @xmath26    it is therefore the actions ( [ taylor ] ) that will provide us the gravitational lifshitz background ( [ gravsol])-([black ] ) .",
    "we will now construct our minimal phenomenological model of holographic superconductivity by adding to ( [ taylor ] ) the action term @xmath27 where we have introduced a charged scalar field @xmath28 and a @xmath29 gauge field @xmath30 , following @xcite , and where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "we will assume that there is neglible interaction with the gravitational background and therefore it remains fixed and given by the lifshitz black hole solution ( [ gravsol])-([black ] ) .",
    "this lack of back reaction means we are effectively working in the probe limit ( very large scalar field charge ) . as we will explain below",
    ", the scalar field mass will be set so as to get particular dimensions for the condensate under study .",
    "the general equations of motion for these fields are @xmath33 where @xmath34 we propose the following ansatz for the component fields @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a real function . under",
    "this ansatz the equations of motion ( [ psieom1])-([phieom1 ] ) become @xmath37 this system of equations admits the no - hair solution @xmath38 . in this case",
    "the gauge field has solutions @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a constant .",
    "this no - hair solution will correspond to the normal phase of the superconductor .",
    "the superconducting phase will be given by solutions with @xmath41 .",
    "from the equations of motion ( [ eompsi])-([eomphi ] ) we see that the asymptotic @xmath42 behavior of the fields is @xmath43 and @xmath44 with @xmath45 from where we get the bf - bound on the mass @xmath46    according to the ads / cft dictionary , the asymptotic coefficient @xmath47 corresponds to an operator of dimension @xmath48 , while @xmath49 corresponds to a source in the boundary theory .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath50 and @xmath51 correspond to the chemical potential and the charge density of the dual field theory , respectively . in order to solve eqs .",
    "( [ eompsi])-([eomphi ] ) we will impose the regularity condition at the horizon @xmath52 . also , from eq .",
    "( [ eompsi ] ) we obtain the additional condition at @xmath53 @xmath54 additionally , in order to simplify the numerical calculations , we will make use of the scaling symmetries @xmath55    as explained in the introduction , we will focus on the particular case @xmath9 .",
    "this means we will take @xmath56 .",
    "when looking for hairy solutions to the equations of motion one has two possible boundary conditions at @xmath42 .",
    "one can set @xmath57 ( _ standard quantization condition _ ) , in which case one has the operator @xmath47 ( dimension @xmath48 ) as the superconductor order parameter .",
    "conversely , one can set the boundary condition @xmath58 ( _ alternative quantization condition _ ) , which results in the operator @xmath49 ( dimension @xmath59 ) being the superconductor order parameter .",
    "having set either one of these boundary conditions , one can proceed to solve the equations of motion through the shooting method .      going back to the allowed values for the dynamical critical exponent",
    ", we see that for the @xmath9 case we can have @xmath60 . throughout this paper , for both brevity and simplicity , we will choose to work with the integer values @xmath61 .",
    "this suits perfectly our primary objective , stated in the introduction , which is to have a general idea of how the dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 affects our holographic superconductor with respect to its behavior in the usual ( @xmath5 ) isotropic realization of the gauge / gravity duality .",
    "as will be seen in the following , the general tendency in the behavior of the physical quantities of the system will be very clear when treating these values .    in order to have a more comprehensive study of the effect of the dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 on our holographic superconductor",
    ", we will choose to work in the following cases :    @xmath62 * case i*. we set the value of the scalar field mass as @xmath63 in this way , we have @xmath64 so that the asymptotic behavior of the scalar field at @xmath42 is @xmath65 in this case , we will set @xmath66 for all values of @xmath0 considered , so that the superconducting order parameter of the system will be given by @xmath67 of dimension 3 .",
    "@xmath62 * case ii*. we set the scalar mass as @xmath68 this choice of mass results in @xmath69 so that near @xmath42 we have @xmath70 here we will choose to set @xmath71 and the order parameter of the superconductor will be given by @xmath72 of dimension 1 .    in figures [ o3z]-[o1z ]",

    "we notice that the near-@xmath2 the condensate behaves as @xmath74 for all values of @xmath0 .",

    "since this expansion is done near the value @xmath78 , this means that we find ourselves near the point where the condensate vanishes .",

    "indeed , the computation of @xmath13 presented above comes from an energetic analysis , conducted directly from the dual system s ginzburg - landau action .",

    "we computed through holographic techniques the ginzburg - landau lagrangian parameters @xmath128 , @xmath129 and , as with the characteristic lengths , concluded that they have the standard near-@xmath2 functional dependency on temperature for all condensate cases and all values of @xmath0 .",
    "however , the presence of @xmath0 does have a non - trivial effect on this phenomenological parameters , diminishing the value of their numerical coefficients as @xmath0 raises .",
    "we have also computed with holographic techniques the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath13 of the system . for all case of condensation and all values of @xmath0",
    ", we saw that @xmath130 .",

    "moreover , we also observed that , for each case of condensation considered , the value of @xmath13 became lower for higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "this means that in systems with higher anisotropy , vortex formation is more strongly unfavored energetically and exhibit a stronger type i behavior .    finally , we computed the critical magnetic field @xmath14 needed to break the superconducting phase of the system , following the perturbative procedure first developed in @xcite .",
    "we observed that the critical field near-@xmath2 functional dependence on temperature is the one predicted by ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "however , we also note that the value of the critical magnetic field is smaller for higher values of @xmath0 .",
    "additionally , within this perturbative approach , we have confirmed holographically the conjecture posed in @xcite that the critical magnetic field is inversely proportional to the square of the correlation length , in accordance to ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "all of the above results were obtained from a minimal model of superconductivity following @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see how these results would be affected by the choice of other models , such as , for instance , d - wave holographic superconductors @xcite , models with higher corrections to the scalar field potential such as the ones that appear in top - down approaches @xcite or less conventional models such as ones with chern - simons terms , higher - derivative couplings or in the context of new massive gravity @xcite .",
