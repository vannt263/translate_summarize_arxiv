    "the hallmark of the integer quantum effect ( iqhe ) in an open geometry is the localized nature of all two - dimensional ( bulk ) states while an integer number of chiral edge states freely propagates along the one - dimensional boundaries  @xcite .",
    "these chiral edge states are immune to the physics of anderson localization as long as backward scattering between edge states of opposite chiralities is negligible  @xcite .",
    "many - body interactions among electrons can be treated perturbatively in the iqhe provided the characteristic many - body energy scale is less than the single - particle gap between landau levels .",
    "this is not true anymore if the chemical potential lies within a landau level as the non - interacting many - body ground state is then macroscopically degenerate .",
    "the lifting of this extensive degeneracy by the many - body interactions is a non - perturbative effect . at some `` magic '' filling fractions that deliver the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe )  @xcite , a screened coulomb interaction selects a finitely degenerate family of ground states , each of which describes a featureless liquid separated from excitations by an energy gap in a closed geometry .",
    "such a ground state is called an incompressible fractional hall liquid .",
    "the fqhe is an example of topological order  @xcite . in an open geometry , there are branches of excitations that disperse across the spectral gap of the two - dimensional bulk , but these excitations are localized along the direction normal to the boundary while they propagate freely along the boundary  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the iqhe , these excitations need not all share the same chirality . however , they are nevertheless immune to the physics of anderson localization provided scattering induced by the disorder between distinct edges in an open geometry is negligible .",
    "the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) is the archetype of a two - dimensional topological band insulator .",
    "the two - dimensional @xmath0 topological band insulator is a close relative of the iqhe that occurs in semi - conductors with sufficiently large spin - orbit coupling but no breaking of time - reversal symmetry  @xcite . as with the iqhe ,",
    "the smoking gun for the @xmath0 topological band insulator is the existence of gapless kramers degenerate pairs of edge states that are delocalized along the boundaries of an open geometry as long as disorder - induced scattering between distinct boundaries is negligible .",
    "in contrast to the iqhe , it is the odd parity in the number of kramers pairs of edge states that is robust to the physics of anderson localization .",
    "a simple example of a two - dimensional @xmath0 topological band insulator can be obtained by putting together two copies of an iqhe system with opposite chiralities for up and down spins .",
    "for instance , one could take two copies of haldane s model  @xcite , each of which realizes an integer hall effect on the honeycomb lattice , but with hall conductance differing by a sign . in this case",
    "the spin current is conserved , a consequence of the independent conservation of the up and down currents , and the spin hall conductance inherits its quantization from the iqhe of each spin species .",
    "this example thus realizes an integer quantum spin hall effect ( iqshe ) .",
    "however , although simple , this example is not generic .",
    "the @xmath0 topological band insulator does not necessarily have conserved spin currents , let alone quantized responses .    along the same line of reasoning ,",
    "two copies of a fqhe system put together , again with opposite chiralities for up and down particles , would realize a fractional quantum spin hall effect ( fqshe ) , as proposed by bernevig and zhang .",

    "we will only demand that time - reversal symmetry holds .",
    "we shall thus distinguish the generic cases of fractional topological liquids with time - reversal symmetry from the special cases of fractional topological liquids with time - reversal symmetry _ and _ with residual spin-1/2 u(1 ) rotation symmetry .",
