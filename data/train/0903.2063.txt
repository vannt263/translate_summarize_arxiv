    "the key result is that small changes in the ratio @xmath13 can give rise to fundamental changes of the phase diagram .",

    "_ et al . _ is not clear .",
    "one reason might be that we consider a triangular lattice ( 3 sites per cluster ) while in ref .",
    "@xcite a square lattice with one diagonal was used ( 4 sites per cluster ) . however , since the experimentally observed critical temperature is much lower than the range treated in ref .",
    "@xcite , it would be interesting to apply continuous - time qmc to this problem in order to reach lower temperatures .",
    "the reentrant behavior for @xmath24 is in striking contrast to the phase diagram obtained for the isotropic triangular lattice shown in fig .",
    "this limit resembles more closely the phase diagram derived within single - site dmft .",
    "@xcite the main effect of short - range fluctuations in the isotropic case is a significant lowering of the critical coulomb energy . here , @xmath50  ev  @xmath51 , whereas @xmath52 in local dmft for the triangular lattice .",
    "@xcite comparing figs .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) , it is evident that anisotropy causes a further lowering of the critical coulomb energies .",
    "this trend is consistent with @xmath53 for the fully unfrustrated square lattice @xcite which is topologically equivalent to the triangular lattice in the limit @xmath54 .",
    "it is interesting also to analyze the width of the metal - insulator coexistence region obtained by increasing vs. decreasing pressure . for @xmath0-cl ,",
    "it is observed at @xmath55bar , which according to the high-@xmath35 nrg analysis corresponds to band width changes of about 2% .",
    "@xcite the calculated coexistence region shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) is only slightly wider than this experimental range .",
    "-5 mm    the qualitative change in the phase diagram caused by reduced geometrical frustration can be understood by analyzing the magnetic properties of the frustrated lattice . in the @xmath56 limit",
    ", the hubbard model can be mapped onto the anisotropic heisenberg model with @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath24 and @xmath22 , respectively . at @xmath59 , @xmath22 yields long range antiferromagnetic ( af ) order of the 120@xmath60 type , whereas @xmath24 gives rise to row - wise af nel order .",
    "@xcite however , in the heisenberg model the temperature scale for af order in the isotropic triangular lattice is expected to be strongly suppressed relative to the square lattice . for the hubbard model ,",
    "the cluster dmft provides information on how the magnetic correlations @xmath61 vary across the mott transition in the isotropic case compared with @xmath24 .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] demonstrate that spin correlations are strongly enhanced as the geometrical frustration is suppressed .",
    "the isotropic lattice displays weak af coupling for any @xmath39 .",
    "this is in contrast to @xmath24 , for which the weaker hopping amplitude displays ferromagnetic correlations whereas spins with the larger hopping amplitude are antiferromagnetically coupled , indicating a row - wise af neel arrangement of spins .",
    "thus , @xmath24 induces a much stronger tendency towards magnetic order than @xmath22 , which explains why the reentrant behavior occurs for @xmath24 , but not for @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . at low @xmath35 ,",
    "the electron entropy is suppressed for @xmath24 as compared to @xmath22 .",
    "as @xmath35 is increased for @xmath24 , the system lowers its free energy by transforming to a metal since the entropy of the metal exceeds that of the ordered insulator . at even higher temperatures the system gains entropy of @xmath62 by transforming back into a paramagnetic insulator .",
    "this result is analogous to the one found for the unfrustrated square lattice .",
    "@xcite in the isotropic lattice magnetic ordering is suppressed and the reentrant behavior disappears .",

    "plotted is the average over the three inequivalent sites within the unit cell .",
    "since we are here concerned with the metal - insulator transition we give the ed cluster spectra which can be evaluated without requiring extrapolation from matsubara to real frequencies . in the metallic phase",
    "the spectra reveal large quasi - particle weight at low frequencies as well as upper and lower hubbard bands at high frequencies .",
    "the insulating phase exhibits a mott gap , as well as pronounced spectral weight in the region of the hubbard bands .",
    "qualitatively similar features are also seen for the unfrustrated square lattice . @xcite",
    "in conclusion , the phase diagrams of the hubbard model for the isotropic and anisotropic triangular lattices have been determined within cluster dmft and exact diagonalization . for moderate frustration , @xmath24 ,",
