    ".    given graphs @xmath6 and @xmath7 and any subset @xmath12 of vertices in @xmath6 referred to as the _ root set _ , the _ hierarchical product _ , denoted @xmath13 , is the graph @xmath9 with vertex set @xmath14 whereby any two vertices @xmath15 and @xmath16 of @xmath10 are adjacent if either @xmath17 and @xmath18 or @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "letting @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the order of the graphs @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , then the hierarchical product @xmath24 is of order @xmath25 .",
    "the hierarchical product can thus be understood intuitively as @xmath23 copies of the graph @xmath6 , which are themselves connected at the vertices included in the root set @xmath12 via the graph @xmath7 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we illustrate the generic structure of a hierarchical product with an illustrative example of the roles of two graphs @xmath6 and @xmath7 of order @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , and root set @xmath8 in @xmath6 .",
    "we note that the hierarchical product can be further generalized to include the product of an arbitrary number of graphs  @xcite .",
    "however , as such hierarchical products can be defined recursively , we focus on hierarchical products of two graphs .",
    "next , we introduce a coupling parameter to weigh the contributions of the graphs @xmath6 and @xmath7 to the hierarchical product @xmath28 . denoting the coupling parameter @xmath29",
    ", we weigh the links @xmath9 owing to @xmath6 and @xmath7 by the sigmoidal functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "thus for @xmath32 the graph @xmath6 is weighted more heavily than @xmath7 , for @xmath33 the graph @xmath7 is weighted more heavily than @xmath6 , and for @xmath34 the graphs @xmath6 and @xmath7 are weighted equally . to express the adjacency matrix of the hierarchical product we utilize the kronecker product .",

    "we focus on the case where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are both undirected and unweighted , and thus @xmath38 and @xmath39 are symmetric and binary , however these assumptions can be easily relaxed to generalize the results presented below .    before proceeding to the analysis we use the example in fig .",

    "these limiting behaviors each consist of five limiting values to which all the eigenvalues approach , but in general the number of limiting values for small and large @xmath35 need not match .",

    "we will present an asymptotic analysis for the behavior of the full spectrum of eigenvalues in the limits of both large and small @xmath35 which will recover the exact limiting values of each eigenvalues well as the leading - order relaxation to these values .",
    "moreover , our asymptotic analysis predicts the dip we observe in the pf eigenvalue , and can be used to accurately predict dynamical behavior on hierarchical products .",

    "specifically , when the root set is comprised of poorly - connected vertices this dip in the pf eigenvalue is accentuated , while when the root set is comprised of well - connected vertices this dip is less pronounced ( albeit still present ) . finally , as an application of our theory",
    ", we have studied the dynamics of the sis epidemic model on hierarchical products , accurately predicting the epidemic threshold ( i.e. , the critical transition delineating the long - time persistence or extinction of the epidemic ) as a function of the coupling parameter .    the construction of a graph via the hierarchical product represents a new method for building a large structure @xmath9 from smaller structures @xmath152  @xcite .",
    "compared to the cartesian product  @xcite ( of which the hierarchical product is a generalization ) the hierarchical product captures connectivity characteristics that are less uniform and therefore promotes heterogeneity throughout the graph . given the role of the eigenvalue spectra of various connectivity matrices in determining both dynamical and structural properties of the underlying graphs , the study of these eigenvalue spectra and their analytical approximations is an important direction of research . in this paper",
    "we have focused on the eigenvalue spectrum of the adjacency matrix , and in this way our work fits in the larger framework of studying the spectral properties of interconnected and multilayer networks to inform both the behavior of both linear and nonlinear dynamical behaviors  @xcite .",
    "important future work includes the eigenvalue spectra of other coupling matrices of hierarchical products .",
    "one such example with many physical applications is the eigenvalue spectrum of the combinatorial graph laplacian , which plays an important role in shaping diffusion processes on graphs  @xcite as well as determining a networks synchronization properties  @xcite .",
    "another important coupling matrix is the modularity matrix which determines the community structures that make up a graph  @xcite .",
