    "in this work we will consider a quantum superintegrable system living in a two - dimensional hyperboloid of two - sheets .",
    "although this system is well known in the literature @xcite-@xcite and can be dealt with standard procedures @xcite-@xcite , it will be studied here under a different point of view based on the properties of intertwining operators ( io ) , a form of darboux transformations @xcite .",
    "we will see how this approach can give a simple explanation of the main features of this physical system .",
    "the intertwining operators and integrable hamiltonians have been studied in previous references @xcite-@xcite , but we will supply here a thorough non - trivial application by means of this example .",
    "besides , there are several points of interest for the specific case here considered because of the non - compact character .",
    "the intertwining operators are first order differential operators connecting different hamiltonians in the same class ( called hierarchy ) and they are associated to separable coordinates of the hamiltonians .",
    "we will obtain just a complete set of such intertwining operators , in the sense that any of the hamiltonians of the hierarchy can be expressed in terms of these operators .",
    "in our case the initial io s close an algebraic structure which is the non - compact lie algebra @xmath0 ( see @xcite for a compact case ) . in a second step",
    "we will get a larger @xmath1 lie algebra of operators .",
    "this structure allows us to characterize the discrete spectrum and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the system by means of ( infinite dimensional ) irreducible unitary representations ( iur ) .",
    "the construction of such representations , as it is known , is not so standard as for compact lie algebras .",
    "we will compute the ground state and characterize the representation space of the wave - functions which share the same energy .",
    "notice that these systems include also a continuum spectrum , but we will not go into this point here .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces the superintegrable hamiltonians and section 3 shows how to build the io s connecting hierarchies of these kind of hamiltonians . in section 4",
    "it is seen that these operators close a @xmath0 algebra .",
    "the hamiltonians are related to the casimirs of such an algebra , while the discrete spectrum of the hamiltonians is related to unitary representations ( iur s ) of @xmath0 .",
    "next , in section 5 a broader class of io s is defined leading to the @xmath1 lie algebra , and it is shown how this new structure helps to understand better the hamiltonians in the new hierarchies .",
    "finally , some remarks and conclusions in section 6 will end the paper .",
    "let us consider the two - dimensional two - sheet hyperboloid @xmath2 , where we define the following hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 , and the differential operators @xmath5 constitute a realization of the @xmath6 lie algebra with lie commutators @xmath7=-j_{2 } , \\qquad   [ j_{2},j_{0}]=j_{1},\\qquad   [ j_{1},j_{2}]=j_{0}.\\ ] ] the generator @xmath8 corresponds to a rotation around the axis @xmath9 , while the generators @xmath10 and @xmath11 give pseudo - rotations ( i.e. , non - compact rotations ) around the axes @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
