    "substructures and satellite galaxies interacting and merging with the mw can significantly affect the dynamical state of its stellar disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such gravitational interactions may result in tidal heating of the disk @xcite , in the excitation of bending waves ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in tilts and warps ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in flaring ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or may trigger the growth of non - axisymmetric structures such as bars @xcite and ring - like stellar enhancements ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent high resolution n - body simulations have also shown that massive substructures colliding with the mw disk may excite wave - like changes of the stellar density and velocity components of disk stars @xcite .",
    "specifically , it has been suggested that the passage of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( @xmath0 @xmath1 at infall into the mw halo ; @xcite ) may be responsible for the ringing of the mw disk @xcite . gravitational encounters with such comparably massive satellite galaxies",
    "are also suspected to be the cause of the observed north / south asymmetries in the stellar number densities and mean vertical and radial stellar velocities @xcite .    while massive satellite galaxies have the largest impact on the dynamical state of the mw disk , they are relatively rare at the present epoch @xcite .",
    "low mass substructures are more numerous and they have a qualitatively similar ( although significantly weaker ) effect on stars in the mw disk .",
    "low mass substructures ( @xmath2 @xmath1 ) are hard to detect in the electromagnetic spectrum because they are largely devoid of gas and stars as a result of the increase in the thermal jeans mass following re - ionization @xcite . proposed methods to detect such substructures around the milky way ( mw ) rely on gamma - ray emission from the annihilation of dark matter @xcite , or on the gravitational scattering of stars in the tidal streams of satellite galaxies @xcite .    the unknown nature of dark matter and its annihilation channels , as well as the large background of gamma - rays from more conventional astrophysical sources , poses major challenges for the former approach @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the low signal - to - noise ratio of the available observational data and the low number of suitable streams limit the use of tidal streams to detect substructures @xcite .",
    "so far , neither approach has produced definite evidence in favor of truly starless dark matter halos orbiting the mw .",
    "the observational difficulties are substantial , yet , the identification of starless , low - mass substructures will have profound implications for the understanding of dark matter . for instance , it will provide direct evidence for the existence of dark matter that is clustered on small scales .",
    "furthermore , the number density of dark matter halos encodes invaluable information about the primordial power spectrum , the physics of the early universe , and the nature of dark matter @xcite .",
    "for instance , in warm dark matter models , a competitor of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm , structure formation is suppressed below the free - streaming scale of the dark matter particle , resulting in a deficit in substructure with masses below @xmath3 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we propose to detect dark substructures as they pass through the disk of the mw based on their gravitational pull on disk stars .",
    "specifically , we will show that such substructures leave a tell - tale kinematic imprint in the velocity field of disk stars that could potentially be measured with the large - scale , high - precision astrometric mission gaia .",
    "the main idea is straightforward .",
    "an object that passes with relative speed @xmath4 through the stellar disk induces a localized velocity impulse in the disk of about ( see appendix [ app : velchange ] )    v _ * & ~ f + & 2.2 ( ) ( ) ( ) f .",
    "[ eq : deltav ]    here @xmath5 is the newton constant , @xmath6 is a factor of order unity that depends on the orbit of the perturber , @xmath7 is the impact parameter of the encounter for a star in the disk , and @xmath8 is a characteristic mass of the passing object . for a point - like perturber , @xmath8 is the total mass . for an object with an extended but steeply radially declining density profile",
    ", @xmath8 is approximately the mass within @xmath7 .",
    "velocity changes caused by passing low - mass substructures are thus smaller than the velocity dispersion of the stars in the disk ( @xmath925 km s@xmath10 in the solar neighborhood , e.g. , ) .",
    "however , as stars in the same vicinity ( within 1 - 2 kpc for a @xmath11 @xmath1 perturber ) experience approximately the same force , the kinematic signature of the substructure may in principle be recovered by spatially averaging a sufficiently large sample of disk star velocities .    measuring this kinematic",
    "imprint offers a variety of advantages compared with approaches that infer the presence of perturbers from the excitation of kinematic or density waves in the stellar disk .",
    "first , the velocity perturbations have a unique morphology that enables us to differentiate them from disturbances caused by , e.g. , spiral structure or a stellar bar .",
    "second , the kinematic signal localized ( to within a few kpc ) before winding sets in and , hence , can be used to track where the substructure passed through the disk .",
    "third , the signal has a life time of @xmath12 myr .",
    "this time is long enough to make it likely that we can observe the imprint of one or several substructures crossing the disk at any given time .",
    "it is also short enough to erase the memory of the multitude of previous encounters and , hence , presents the disk as a clean slate every @xmath9half dynamical time .",
    "in contrast , bending modes and density waves likely survive for several rotation periods ( e.g. ) . furthermore , although the observed kinematic asymmetries in the radial and vertical directions ( e.g. , @xcite ) could be caused by an external perturber , it is also possible that they are excited by internal non - axisymmetric features of the mw disk @xcite .",
    "the localized , short - lived kinematic velocity impulse that gives rise to equation ( [ eq : deltav ] ) avoids these problems and thus minimizes the number of false positive detections of dark substructures .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the feasibility of the proposed detection method using high resolution numerical simulations and mock stellar catalogs .",
    "we introduce the numerical set - up in section [ sect : numsetup ] . in section [",
    "sect : compsims ] we analyze the kinematic signature that the passing substructure imparts on the stellar disk .",
    "we estimate the rate of substructure collisions with the mw in section [ sect : collisions ] .",
    "we discuss the implementation of the proposed method with a gaia - based survey in section [ sect : gaia ] .",
    "we summarize our findings and conclude in section [ sect : summary ] .",
    "our numerical set - up consists of models of @xmath13 a dynamically stable , dissipationless galaxy with properties similar to the mw @xcite and @xmath14 a dark matter substructure with virial mass @xmath15 @xmath1 , scale radius 1.3 kpc , mass within the scale radius of @xmath16 @xmath1 , and virial circular velocity 15 km s@xmath10 , see appendix [ app : modelsetup ] .",
    "the mass ( @xmath17 @xmath1 ) and force resolution ( @xmath18 pc ) of our numerical set - up are adequate to follow accurately the dynamical evolution of the coupled mw  substructure system .",

    "we discuss three representative choices of orbital parameters : a vertical , a prograde , and a retrograde orbit , see table  [ tab : icsmain ] .",

    "we describe the set - up of the mw  substructure collisions in detail in appendix [ app : modelsetup ] .",

    "we adopt conservative values for the gravity opening angle ( 0.55 ) and the time stepping factor ( @xmath34 ) in order to ensure an accurate integration of the equations of motions of the stellar and dark matter particles in our models .",
    "we evolve the n - body realizations of the mw and the substructure in isolation for 500 myrs to minimize non - equilibrium transients caused by the initial conditions .",
    "the structural and kinematical properties of our n - body model do not show significant evolution during this equilibration period indicating that the initial setup is indeed close to a self - consistent steady state .",
    "we subsequently integrate numerically the dynamical evolution of the combined mw  substructure system .",
    "our simulations span about 380 myr of evolution , including about 190 myr after the substructure passes through the mw disk .       in the left panel of fig .  [",

    "the velocity dipole is oriented perpendicular to the impact site of the substructure and has opposite polarity for the prograde and retrograde case . at late times",
    "stars move in bulk away from the substructure in the prograde case and stars move toward the substructure in the retrograde case .",
