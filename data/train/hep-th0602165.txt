    "in recent years there have been significant advances in our understanding of the physical properties of d - branes throughout the entire moduli space of a given calabi - yau compactification . in particular , for type ii compactifications douglas showed that the topological b - branes are in one - to - one correspondence with the objects of the derived category of coherent sheaves on the  variety @xcite .",
    "to relate the topological b - branes to the physical ones he also pioneered the notion of @xmath2-stability .",
    "subsequently bridgeland axiomatized @xmath2-stability .",
    "since the kahler deformations are exact in the topological b - model , the derived category description of topological b - branes is valid at any point of the moduli space .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath3 type ii compactifications generically have a rich phase structure and the description of b - branes in the various phases is quite different .",
    "this gives rise to interesting mathematical statements , the best known of which is the celebrated mckay correspondence .    in general",
    ", determining the set of @xmath2-stable branes is cumbersome .",
    "one could start at a point with a good understanding of stability , e.g. , a large radius point , where @xmath2-stability reduces to @xmath4-stability , and try to catalog what objects are lost and gained as the kahler moduli are varied @xcite .    among the stable branes some of the most intriguing ones are the fractional branes .",
    "they are fractional in the following sense : assume that we are given a  3-fold which develops a singularity somewhere in the kahler moduli space .",
    "we can probe the singularity using a space - filling d3-brane . at this point in kahler moduli space",
    "the probe d3-brane becomes ( marginally ) unstable and _ decays _ into the fractional branes .",
    "this picture applies in a rather broad context , and is not restricted to orbifolds , although it was first discovered for orbifolds .    on the other hand , orbifolds provide a rich testing ground . in this case",
    "d - branes can be described explicitly as boundary states in a solvable conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "the world - volume theory of the probe d3-brane , which is a quiver gauge theory @xcite , gives a very different description of the d - branes , as objects in the derived category of representations of the quiver .",
    "the mckay correspondence gives an equivalence between this category and the derived category of coherent sheaves on the resolved space @xcite , as required by the topological string argument .",
    "the mckay correspondence is a prototype of what happens in general : in different patches of the moduli space one has very different looking descriptions for the d - branes , which sit in _ inequivalent _ categories , but if one passes to the derived category then they all become equivalent .",
    "therefore it makes sense to talk about a geometric representative for a brane at any point in moduli space . passing from an abelian category to the derived category",
    "is physically motivated by brane ",
    "anti - brane annihilation , thorough tachyon condensation @xcite .    in the quiver language",
    "the fractional branes are the simple representations , i.e. , those that have no non - trivial subrepresentations .",
    "although the fractional branes are obvious in the quiver language , their geometric incarnation is unclear .",
    "the mckay correspondence tells us that there should be objects ( bundles or perhaps complexes ) on the resolved space whose @xmath5-quiver is the one we started with .",
    "one of the central problems in this area is to find these objects .    as a warm - up exercise",
    "one can try to determine the k - theory class of a fractional brane .",
    "so far , even this question has been answered only in a limited context , using mirror symmetry techniques @xcite or the mckay correspondence .",
    "a first goal of this paper is to get a deeper understanding of the geometry of fractional branes , going beyond k - theory .",
    "we do this without resorting to mirror symmetry or the mckay correspondence .",
    "instead we use the quantum symmetry of an orbifold theory to generate the fractional branes as an orbit .",
    "this method has been successful for the @xmath6 orbifolds @xcite .",
    "ultimately one would like to understand the world - volume theory of d - branes at an arbitrary point in the moduli space of a compact .",
    "studying examples where one has at his disposal different methods hopefully will teach us the `` mechanics '' of the geometric approach , and would certainly lead to results of phenomenological interest .",
    "a second goal is to develop techniques to study monodromies in the kahler moduli space .",
    "monodromies played a crucial role in seiberg - witten theory @xcite , and represent a subject of interest in itself . using geometric engineering",
    "one can relate the seiberg - witten monodromies to d - brane monodromies @xcite . as we will see",
    "shortly , the functors implementing the monodromy transformations are not simple by any measure .",
    "the relations they satisfy would be very hard to guess without physical input . by the end",
    ", we will have performed some very strong consistency checks .",
    "it is not surprising that a simple version of our functors , the seidel - thomas twist functors , plays an important role in bridgeland s work on @xmath2-stability @xcite .",
    "a third motivation is to investigate what , if anything , can be gained by using stacks .",
    "our investigations are ultimately very different from the ones pioneered by sharpe and collaborators .",
    "our approach relies on an extension of the mckay correspondence due to kawamata , and naturally associates branes to regions of the moduli space where we have no solvable cft description or reliable supergravity approximation .",
    "fortunately , the algebro - geometric tools are powerful enough to produce several collections of fractional branes .",
    "this approach provides a detailed understanding of the @xmath7 spaces @xcite , as assumed in @xcite .",
    "it came as a surprise to the present author to realize that using stacks one can construct several collections of fractional branes for @xmath0 , for _ any _ @xmath8 and @xmath9 ! the same statement is far from being true without the use of stacks .",
    "let us illustrate this point using the main workhorse of the paper , @xmath1 .",
    "this singularity has two partial resolutions , with exceptional divisors @xmath10 and @xmath11 . is just @xmath12 , but as stacks they are different . ]",
    "viewing both of them as stacks , one has length five exceptional collections @xmath13 .",
    "the candidate fractional branes are the push - forwards of the dual collections .",
    "we prove that both @xmath10 and @xmath11 lead to the same @xmath5 s quiver . naturally , the details for the two cases are quite different , but the final result is the same .",
    "the superpotential comes from the @xmath14 s and is related to an @xmath15-structure .",
    "so going from @xmath10 to @xmath11 does not change the quiver , but reinterprets the different terms in the superpotential in a non - trivial way .",
    "another motivation to understand fractional branes comes from the fact that they are related to each other through partial resolutions of the singularity .",
    "for example , the resolution of the @xmath6 singularity has an exceptional divisor which is reducible , with @xmath16 irreducible components @xmath17 s .",
    "the @xmath6 singularity can also be thought of as being produced by the collision of @xmath16 @xmath18 singularities .",
    "a @xmath18 fractional collection is given by @xmath19 $ ] , where @xmath20 .",
    "in @xcite we found the following @xmath6 fractional collection : @xmath21 and @xmath22 $ ] , with @xmath17 from above .",
    "moreover , we proposed a physical explanation for how the @xmath6 collection is obtained from the @xmath18 collections .",
    "it is natural to try to extend the above procedure to an arbitrary singularity .",
    "this would also answer the more interesting question : what is the gauge theory on the world - volume of a d3-brane probing a  singularity .",
    "phrasing it in this form , it is obvious that we are not going to get a simple answer .    given a singularity @xmath23 , we can partially resolve it .",
    "this creates new singularities , call them @xmath24 .",
    "even if we started with an isolated singularity , the resolution might produce non - isolated ones ( this is the case even for @xmath1 ) , therefore @xmath25 might be a continuous index . viewed individually",
    ", the singularity @xmath24 has its own fractional branes @xmath26 .",
    "as the kahler modulus of the blow - up is turned off some of the @xmath26 s get destabilized , and decay .",
    "the decay products are necessarily bound states of the old @xmath26 s , and the ones that remain stable .",
    "we are guaranteed to find the fractional branes of the singularity @xmath23 among these .",
    "the question then is how do we recognize them ?",
    "is there going to be a simple physical rule like the one proposed in @xcite for @xmath6 ?",
    "once the fractional branes for a singularity have been obtained , the gauge theory on the probe will be the quiver theory whose quiver is the @xmath5-quiver of the fractional branes .",
    "this procedure was dubbed `` quiver _ lego _ '' @xcite . using the techniques of @xcite the superpotential",
    "can also be computed , and one might obtain models of phenomenological interest .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we use toric methods to investigate the geometry of the @xmath1 model together with its kahler moduli space .",
    "section  3 starts with a review of the fourier - mukai technology , and then it is applied to the various @xmath1 monodromies . in section  4",
    "we use the @xmath27 monodromy to produce a collection of fractional branes . this collection",
    "is compared to the one given by the mckay correspondence , and we produce an interesting seiberg duality .",
    "in section  5 we turn to a collection of fractional branes on the partially resolved @xmath0 orbifold , using a generalization of the mckay correspondence by kawamata .",
    "the partially resolved orbifold is singular , and it is not a global quotient either , hence it is particularly pleasing that we can handle it directly by geometric methods .",
    "the appendix contains some spectral sequences that are used throughout the paper .",
    "in this section we review some aspects of the @xmath1 orbifold and the associated cft .",
    "first we work out the relevant toric geometry of @xmath1 , then we turn our attention to the moduli space of complexified kahler forms , and in particular its discriminant loci .",
    "we pay particular attention to the singularities in the moduli space .",
    "let us consider the @xmath1 variety with a supersymmetric @xmath27 action , i.e. @xmath28 . a priori there are two choice for the @xmath27 action : @xmath29 and @xmath30 but obviously the second one is the square of the first one , and therefore we can talk about _ the _",
    "@xmath1 variety , which is toric , and a convenient representation for it is provided by the fan in fig .",
    "[ f : fan ] .",
    "@xmath31    more precisely , the fan for the @xmath1 toric variety consists of only one cone , generated by the vertices @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in this figure",
    "we also included the vertices @xmath35 and @xmath36 corresponding to the crepant resolution of the singularity .",
    "we denote the resolved space by @xmath37 .",
    "the exceptional locus of the blow - up is reducible , and it has two irreducible components corresponding to @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we denote the divisors associated to @xmath38 by @xmath39 .",
    "the linear equivalences among the divisors and their intersections are well known , and we simply quote the result of @xcite : is non - compact , one restricts to the intersections of the compact cycles with other cycles , in this case @xmath40 and @xmath41 . ]",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 the tools of toric geometry immediately tell us that the divisor @xmath40 is a @xmath12 , while @xmath41 is the hirzebruch surface @xmath44 .",
    "there are curves in the class of @xmath45 and @xmath46 that lie in the compact divisors @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "in particular @xmath46 is a fiber of @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the @xmath47 section @xmath48 of @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , @xmath45 is the hyperplane class of @xmath12 , while @xmath46 does not intersect @xmath12 .",
    "let us spend a moment analyzing the kahler cone , and its dual , the mori cone . from the geometry it is clear that the curves @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the generators of the mori cone of effective curves .",
    "shrinking @xmath45 also shrinks the divisors @xmath40 , and hence gives a type  ii contraction , while shrinking @xmath46 collapses the hirzebruch surface @xmath44 onto its base , giving a type  iii degeneration .",
    "the kahler cone is dual to the mori cone , and in our case both are two dimensional .",
    "the kahler generators are represented by cohomology classes .",
    "we can use poincare duality and represent the kahler classes by 4-cycles , and in particular divisors .",
    "it is immediate from the intersection products in @xcite that the ordered pair @xmath49 is dual to the ordered pair @xmath50 : @xmath51 therefore the kahler cone is generated by @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the precise ordering in ( [ e : ce1 ] ) will play an important role later on .    by lemma 3.3.2 in @xcite",
    "there is a bijection between the mori cone generators and the generators of the lattice of relations of the point - set @xmath54 .",
    "in particular , @xmath45 and @xmath46 yield the relations @xmath55      the point - set @xmath54 admits four triangulations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:4triang ] ) . therefore in the language of @xcite the gauged linear sigma model ( glsm ) has four phases",
    ". charges of the chiral superfields . ]",
    "the secondary fan has its rays given by the columns of the matrix ( [ e : chargem ] ) , and is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : z3 ] .",
    "the four phases are as follows : the completely resolved smooth phase ; the two phases where one of the compact divisors @xmath40 or @xmath41 has been blown up to partially resolve the @xmath27 fixed point ; and finally the @xmath27 orbifold phase .",

    "alternatively , using the `` old ''  group algebra @xmath64 $ ] of the dual cone @xmath65  construction @xcite , one arrives at the affine scheme @xmath66 = \\spec \\c[u , v , w]/(u v - w^2)$ ] . at the @xmath61",

    "but we can take the secondary fan in fig .",
    "[ fig : z3 ] literally , since it is the fan of moduli space , viewed as a toric variety .",
    "the four cones then have natural coordinates associated to them , and these are as follows : @xmath69 the coordinates @xmath70 are good coordinates on a dense open subset of the moduli space , but fail at the boundary divisors corresponding to the toric compactification of the moduli space .",
    "this is where one needs to make the above change of coordinates .",
    "one also notices the @xmath71 and @xmath72 terms , which reflect the @xmath18 reps . @xmath67",
    "we will use these coordinates momentarily .",
    "the primary components of the discriminant locus of singular cft s can be computed using the horn parametrization @xcite .",
    "we briefly review the construction .",
    "let @xmath73 denote the matrix of charges appearing in cox s holomorphic quotient construction @xcite .",
    "the primary component of the discriminant , @xmath74 , is a rational variety , i.e. , birational to a projective space .",
    "horn uniformization gives an explicit rational parametrization for @xmath74 .",

    "eliminating @xmath84 gives the sought after equation for @xmath74 : @xmath85 in fact this is the only component of the primary discriminant .",
    "the discriminant curve itself is singular .",
    "it has two singular points : @xmath86 the first singular point is a double root of the @xmath87 equation , while the second is a triple root .",
    "this hints to the fact that the local structure of the two singular points is different .    to see the nature of the singularity we need to choose convenient coordinates around the singularities .",
    "we treat the point @xmath88 first",
    ". a convenient change of variables is the following : @xmath89 in terms of the new variables the discriminant becomes @xmath90 this suggests a further change of variables : @xmath91 , in terms of which the leading terms of @xmath74 are @xmath92 which shows that @xmath74 has a cusp at @xmath93 .",
    "a similar analysis can be performed at the other singularity , @xmath94 , and show that @xmath74 has an ordinary double point there .",

    "this collection is to be contrasted with the one obtained in section  [ s : cnfract ] , more precisely ( [ efraccoll ] ) .",
    "next we elucidate their connection using seiberg duality .",
    "the original seiberg duality @xcite is a low - energy equivalence between @xmath418 supersymmetric gauge theories : an @xmath419 theory with @xmath420 fundamental flavors and no superpotential , and an @xmath421 theory with @xmath420 fundamental magnetic flavors with a superpotential containing mesons .",
    "the duality says that both flow to the same theory in the infrared .",
    "we will use the berenstein - douglas @xcite extension of seiberg duality , which has a natural stratification . in its simplest form",
    "it amounts to a base change for the branes .",
    "since the new basis usually involves anti - branes in the language of the old basis , this change is most naturally done in the derived category of coherent sheaves , rather than sheaves alone .",
    "therefore in this form seiberg duality is an autoequivalence of the derived category of coherent sheaves , which by orlov s theorem ( theorem [ thm : orlov ] ) is a fourier - mukai functor .",
    "the most general form of seiberg duality arises when the _ @xmath422-structure _ of the derived category is changed .",
    "this is usually achieved by the use of tilting complexes @xcite .",
    "what makes this possible is the underlying fact that there are different abelian categories with equivalent derived categories .",
    "thus , in general , the difference between two collections of fractional branes can only be partially attributed to a choice of basepoint , since tiltings are more general than auto - equivalences . the mckay collection , although not explicitly , but inherently is associated to the vicinity of the orbifold point . the collection obtained by monodromies explicitly involved the choice of a basepoint for the loops in the moduli space , and this basepoint was in the vicinity of the large volume point .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to expect that the two collections differ only by a change in basepoint .",
    "indeed , one finds that the two collections ( [ e : colmckay ] ) and ( [ efraccoll ] ) are related by monodromy around a point in moduli space where the brane wrapping both @xmath40 and @xmath41 is becoming massless , in other words @xmath423 .",
    "the intuition for this fact comes from two observations .",
    "first , one recognizes that in k - theory @xmath424 , and second , that @xmath425 , where @xmath426 is the cotangent bundle of @xmath12 .",
    "the authors of @xcite seem to be unaware of these facts .",
    "since @xmath427 is 3-spherical , by an autoequivalence . ] , lemma  [ lemma:41 ] tells us that @xmath428)=k_*\\o_{d_4+d_5}[2 - 2]=k_*\\o_{d_4+d_5}.\\ ] ] this establishes a link between the two sets .",
    "one can go further , and show that @xmath429 , for @xmath400 from the collection ( [ efraccoll ] ) , is precisely the set given in ( [ e : colmckay ] ) .",
    "this is the most one can say at this point , since the collection ( [ e : colmckay ] ) is defined only in k - theory .",
    "one can turn the argument around , and propose that the above relationship lifts to @xmath131 , in other words the mckay collection is given by @xmath423 applied to ( [ efraccoll ] ) .",
    "this is easy to compute , since all the necessary @xmath300 s can be read off from the quiver .",

    ".    it would be interesting to reproduce the collection ( [ e : colmckay23 ] ) by a direct computation , using @xmath412 from the mckay correspondence ( [ eq : psiphi ] ) , as done for @xmath60 in @xcite , and for @xmath6 in @xcite .",
    "the partial resolutions of the @xmath0 singularity form a partially ordered set .",

    "this representation links the different group actions ( [ e : crepact ] ) to the various rational affine combinations of the base vectors @xmath443 .    for simplicity",
    "we assume that the @xmath435 s do not have a common divisor .",
    "if this were not the case , than this common divisor @xmath447 would also divide @xmath448 , and the @xmath449 subgroup of @xmath432 would act trivially , effectively reducing the action to @xmath450 .",

    "the lattice vector @xmath444 gives rise to a torus - invariant divisor @xmath451 .",
