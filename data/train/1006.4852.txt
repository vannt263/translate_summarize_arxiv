    "the integer @xmath1 is the _ size _ of the cube diagram and the _ cube number _ of a knot , denoted @xmath8 , is the smallest @xmath1 for which there is a cube diagram for the knot of size @xmath1 .    in @xcite small examples of cube diagrams of knots",
    "were given up to @xmath9 crossings .",
    "in some cases it was observed that the examples given were minimal . in each of these examples",
    "minimality was guaranteed since the arc index , @xmath10 , is less than or equal to the cube number and cube diagrams for @xmath0 can be found with cube number equal to @xmath10 .",
    "cube number is a far more powerful invariant than arc index .",
    "for example , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mirror image of @xmath0 for all knots and links , but :    * theorem 1 * _ for eight of the first twelve chiral knots in rolfsen s knot table ( up to @xmath9-crossing knots ) , cube number detects chirality and no counter example is known to exist in the remaining four cases .",

    "perhaps surprisingly , the legendrian cube number detects legendrian knot type in some cases .",
    "this fact is unexpected because there is no clear relationship as of yet between cube diagrams and legendrian knots ( cube diagrams do not naturally embed as legendrian knots even when they have the same legendrian knot projections ) . in this paper",
    "we prove :    * theorem 2 * _ let @xmath14 be the left hand @xmath15-torus knot with maximal thurston - bennequin number and @xmath16 and @xmath17 the @xmath15-torus knot with maximal thurston - bennequin number and @xmath18 .",
    "then the legendrian cube number distinguishes between @xmath14 and @xmath17 .",
    "_    we conclude this paper with a conjecture that generalizes theorem 2 to all @xmath19 torus knots and show that this conjecture is true if conjecture [ gridmoves ] is true .",

    "flat of @xmath21 _ is any cuboid ( a right rectangular prism ) with integer vertices in @xmath21 such that there are two orthogonal edges of length @xmath1 with the remaining orthogonal edge of length @xmath22 .",
    "a flat with an edge of length 1 that is parallel to the @xmath23-axis , @xmath24-axis , or @xmath25-axis is called an _ @xmath23-flat _ , _",

    "we get an oriented link in @xmath21 by connecting pairs of markings with a line segment whenever two of their corresponding coordinates are the same .",
    "each line segment is oriented to go from an @xmath27 to a @xmath28 , from a @xmath28 to a @xmath29 , or from a @xmath29 to an @xmath27 .",
    "the markings in each flat define two perpendicular segments of the link @xmath31 joined at a vertex , call the union of these segments a _ cube bend_. if a cube bend is contained in an @xmath23-flat , we call it an _ @xmath23-cube bend_. similarly , define",
    "_ @xmath24-cube bends _ and _ @xmath25-cube",
    "bends_.        arrange the markings in @xmath21 so that at every intersection point of the @xmath32-projection ( i.e. , @xmath33 given by @xmath34 ) , the segment parallel to the @xmath23-axis has smaller @xmath25-coordinate than the segment parallel to the @xmath24-axis .",
    "similarly , arrange so that in the @xmath35-projection , @xmath25-parallel segments cross over the @xmath24-parallel segments , and in the @xmath36-projection , the @xmath23-parallel segments cross over the @xmath25-parallel segments ( see figure [ fig : crossings ] ) .",
    "a set of markings in @xmath21 satisfying the marking conditions and crossing conditions is called a _ cube diagram _ for the knot or link .",
    "because cube diagrams project to grid diagrams , it is natural to think of a cube diagram as a lift of a grid diagram corresponding to , say , the @xmath32-projection of the cube .",
    "however , such lifts do not always exist ( c.f . @xcite and @xcite ) .    before proceeding , we need to establish some terminology and facts about grid diagrams ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "grid diagrams will be oriented so that vertical edges are directed from @xmath27 to @xmath37 .",
    "a _ bend _ in a grid diagram , @xmath38 , is a pair of segments that meet at a common @xmath27 or @xmath37 marking .",
    "we will refer to the former pair of segments as an @xmath27-bend and the latter as an @xmath37-bend .",
    "there are two ways to decompose any link component in @xmath38 into a set of non - overlapping bends , corresponding to a choice of @xmath27-bends or @xmath37-bends .",
    "in particular , for a knot there are only two ways to decompose @xmath38 into non - overlapping bends , and such a choice will be called a _ bend decomposition_.    consider a grid diagram , @xmath38 , together with a choice of a bend decomposition .",
    "if possible we wish to lift @xmath38 to a cube diagram where @xmath38 is the @xmath32-projection of the cube diagram and the bend decomposition of @xmath38 determines the @xmath25-cube bends of the cube diagram . while @xmath38 carries with it an orientation on the knot , so does the @xmath32-projection of the cube diagram . in order",
    "that these orientations agree , the @xmath27-bend decompositon of @xmath38 has to be chosen@xmath37-bends can not be lifted to @xmath25-cube bends .",
    "furthermore , because of the symmetry between all three projections in a cube diagram , it is enough to work only with the @xmath32-projection and lift @xmath27-bends to @xmath25-cube bends .",
    "the crossings in a grid diagram sometimes generate a _ partial order _ on the @xmath27-bends .",
    "let @xmath39 and @xmath40 be two @xmath27-bends . if @xmath39 crosses over @xmath40 in @xmath38 we say that @xmath41 .",
    "thus in any lift of @xmath38 , the @xmath25-cube bend corresponding to @xmath39 must have @xmath25-coordinate greater than that of the @xmath25-cube bend corresponding to @xmath40 .",
    "of course , not every grid diagram has a partial order on the @xmath27-bends . a grid diagram",
    "for which there is no partial order on the @xmath27-bends may not even lift to a lattice knot that has well - defined knot projections in the other planes ( figure 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "however , if there is a partial ordering on the @xmath27-bends of the grid diagram , it will lift to a lattice knot in which all projections are well - defined knot projections ( c.f .",
    "nevertheless , even a partial order does nt guarantee liftability to a cube diagram as the @xmath35- and @xmath36-projections may not be grid diagrams in such a lift ( c.f @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "below , we will introduce some grid configurations that fail to lift , not because of a lack of partial ordering but due to crossings in the @xmath35- or @xmath36-projections that do not satisfy the crossing conditions for a cube diagram . in figures [ fig : type1 ] and [ fig : type2 ] , the shaded regions are determined by the corresponding @xmath27-bend and extend from the @xmath27-bend to the boundary of the grid diagram as indicated .",
    "furthermore , a dotted edge represents a sequence of edges in the grid that remains in the shaded region .",
    "this condition is required in the proofs that follow to guarantee that the @xmath35- or @xmath36-projections contain crossings that do not satisfy the crossing conditions for a cube diagram .",
    "the type 1 configurations shown in figure [ fig : type1 ] do not appear in the projection of a cube diagram .",
    "we will prove the result for the center configuration .",
    "the remaining cases are similar .",
    "if we assume first that there is a partial order on the @xmath27-bends of the grid diagram , then the shaded region must contain an @xmath37 marking .",
    "if there is no @xmath37 marking in the shaded region , then @xmath42 and @xmath43 must end at the same @xmath27 mark , and thus there is no partial order on the @xmath27-bends , and no lift . in any lift of the grid to a lattice knot satisfying the marking conditions for a cube diagram at least one such @xmath37 marking must represent a vertical edge that passes through the flat containing the @xmath27-bend shown , since @xmath42 is below the bend and @xmath43 is above . since this @xmath25-parallel edge is located in the shaded region , it must either cross over the @xmath23-parallel edge shown in the @xmath36-projection or behind the @xmath24-parallel edge shown in the @xmath35-projection , which breaks the crossing condition shown in figure [ fig : crossings ] .",
    "the type 2 configurations shown in figure [ fig : type2 ] do not appear in the projection of a cube diagram .",
    "for the first configuration shown in figure [ fig : type2 ] , if the edge ending in @xmath42 has @xmath25-coordinate less than the lower @xmath27-bend then the sequence of edges connecting @xmath42 to @xmath43 must contain an @xmath37-marking .",
    "that @xmath37-marking corresponds to a @xmath25-parallel edge that crosses behind that lower @xmath27-bend in the @xmath35-projection . otherwise , the edge ending in @xmath42 is above that lower @xmath27-bend . in this case , the sequence of edges connecting @xmath44 to @xmath45 must contain an @xmath37-marking that corresponds to a @xmath25-parallel edge that crosses above the edge ending in @xmath42 in the @xmath36-projection . a similar argument",
    "will show that the other configuration fails to lift as well .",
    "[ thm : chirality ] the cube number detects the chirality of the trefoil .",
    "that is , if @xmath46 is the left hand trefoil and @xmath47 is the right hand trefoil , then @xmath48 .",
    "the cube number of the left hand trefoil is 5 and the cube number of the right hand trefoil is 7 .",
    "note first that @xmath49 ( see figure [ fig : lhtrefoil ] ) .",
    "for the right hand trefoil , figure [ fig : rhtrefoils ] shows all minimal grid diagrams . for columns @xmath22 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 there is a type @xmath22 configuration present in the grid ( shown in blue and marked by the @xmath27-bend ) . for columns @xmath52 and @xmath2",
    "there is either no partial order on the bends or there is a type @xmath52 configuration ( shown in blue and marked by the @xmath27-bend ) .    for all examples that have been computed",
    ", the cube number detects the chirality of the knot as in theorem [ thm : chirality ] . for knots with arc index greater than @xmath51 proofs of this nature",
    "become infeasible . however , a computer can do the same basic checks for type 1 and type 2 configurations .",
    "a program was written that generates all grid diagrams , sifts out those that contain type 1 and 2 configurations , and then attempts to lift the remaining diagrams to cube diagrams . upon finding a valid cube diagram ,",
    "the jones polynomial is computed to identify the knot type .",
    "this program has been successfully run up to size @xmath53 diagrams , generating the following result :    [ thm : mainchirality ] the cube number detects the chirality of the following knots : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and the @xmath67 , @xmath15 , and @xmath68 torus knots .    for most knots mentioned in theorem [ thm : mainchirality ] one knot has cube number equal to arc index and all that is known is that the mirror image has cube number strictly greater than arc index .",
    "however , the calculation has also yielded the result that the cube number for the right hand trefoil is equal to @xmath9 and the cube number for the right hand @xmath15 torus knot is @xmath69 ( the program found no diagrams for the right hand @xmath15 torus knot of size @xmath53 or less and an example of size @xmath69 exists ) .",
    "any grid diagram represents the front projection of a legendrian knot by following this procedure . first smooth the northeast and southwest corners",
    "then convert northwest and southeast corners to cusps and rotate the grid diagram @xmath70 degrees counterclockwise . note that some authors ( see @xcite ) describe a similar procedure to obtain a legendrian projection for the mirror image of the knot represented by @xmath38 , while the one described here is for the original knot type represented by @xmath38 . while there is no similar construction to convert a cube diagram into a legendrian knot ,",
    "each of the projections of a cube diagram is a grid diagram , and hence , represents the legendrian front projection of some knot . therefore one can define the legendrian cube number , @xmath13 , to be the smallest @xmath1 such that there is a cube diagram for the knot @xmath0 of size @xmath1 where the @xmath32-projection of the cube diagram is a grid diagram representing the legendrian knot @xmath0 .    according to @xcite the _ rotation number _ may be computed from the legendrian front projection as follows : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the number of downward oriented cusps and @xmath73 is the number of upward oriented cusps in the legendrian front projection .",
    "furthermore , according to @xcite and @xcite , any minimal grid diagram for a left hand legendrian torus knot , @xmath74 , must realize the maximal thurston bennequin number and hence have rotation number satisfying : @xmath75 for the following results we will need to refer to a _ standard diagram _ , @xmath76 , for a @xmath19-torus knot .",
    "a standard diagram for @xmath74 is one that contains all crossings along two diagonals as shown in figure [ fig : standardp2 ] ( note that there is a similar notion of standard diagram for right hand @xmath19-torus knots ) . for the standard diagram shown in figure [ fig : standardp2 ]",
    "the rotation number may be computed as follows : @xmath77 note that each legendrian left hand @xmath19-torus knot realizable in a minimal grid diagram is represented by a standard grid diagram .",
    "also the standard diagram with maximum rotation number is one in which @xmath78 ( recall that @xmath79 ) . similarly the standard diagram with minimum rotation number has @xmath80 .",

    "the program confirmed that there are only @xmath85 distinct minimal diagrams for @xmath14 , precisely those that may be reached from the standard diagram by cyclic permutation .",
    "finally , cyclic permutations do not eliminate all of the type 1 configurations present in each of the @xmath85 diagrams . therefore @xmath86 .",
    "there are also further results regarding cube number and legendrian knot type .",
    "a computer program has been used to show that cube number distinguishes between the legendrian @xmath68 torus knots with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",

    "[ gridmoves ] given a torus knot @xmath74 and a legendrian knot @xmath46 of topological type @xmath74 and a grid diagram for @xmath46 of size @xmath90 .",
    "then there is a sequence of commutation and cyclic permutation moves taking @xmath46 to the standard grid diagram representing it .    to understand the conjecture",
    ", we must first define what is meant by commutation and cyclic permutation .",
    "a cyclic permutation of a grid diagram takes a column ( resp .",
    "row ) adjacent to the boundary of the grid , and moves it to the opposite end of the grid ( c.f .",
    "two adjacent columns ( resp . rows ) are said to be _ interleaved _ if the @xmath24-coordinates ( resp .",

    "a commutation switches the position of any two adjacent rows ( resp .",
    "columns ) that are not interleaved , including pairs that are adjacent with respect to the boundary ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . note that the grid may be thought of as existing on a torus , so opposite edges may be identified ( hence the commutation move includes rows and columns adjacent to the boundaries ) .",
    "furthermore , using this definition of commutation , commutation and cyclic permutation commute .",
    "let @xmath17 and @xmath14 be left hand legendrian torus knots with @xmath91 and maximal thurston - bennequin number such that the rotation number of @xmath17 is maximal and the rotation number of @xmath14 is minimal",
    ". then @xmath92 .    as in the proof of theorem [ thm : legendrian ]",
    "the cube diagram shown in figure [ fig : lhtrefoil ] extends to give a cube diagram for @xmath17 of size equal to the arc index .",
    "also for @xmath93 this result is precisely theorem [ thm : legendrian ] .",
    "a similar argument shows that the result holds for @xmath89 as well .",
    "assume now that @xmath94 .",
    "since cyclic permutation commutes with commutation , all commutation moves may be moved to the beginning of the sequence .",
    "since the standard grid diagram for @xmath14 has no possible commutation moves , it suffices to consider only cyclic permutations .",
    "consider a sequence of cyclic permutation moves .",
    "such a sequence is equivalent one in which the first @xmath42 moves are cyclic permutations down ( i.e. moving the bottom row to the top of the grid ) and the remaining moves , denote the number of moves by @xmath43 , are cyclic permutations to the left ( i.e. moving the left column to the right side of the grid ) .",
    "also , note that doing @xmath42 cyclic permutations down is equivalent to doing @xmath95 cyclic permutations up .",
    "similarly , doing @xmath43 cyclic permutations left is equivalent to doing @xmath96 cyclic permutations right .",
    "now , if @xmath99 and @xmath100 the upper right most type 1 configuration ( labeled @xmath101 in figure [ fig : lhp2 ] ) will remain fixed . if @xmath102 and @xmath103 then the lower left most type 1 configuration ( labeled @xmath104 in figure [ fig : lhp2 ] ) remains .",
    "if @xmath105 and @xmath106 , or if @xmath107 and @xmath108 then the type 1 configuration labeled @xmath109 remains .",
    "note that while chirality is detected in all examples computed so far , it is not true that cube number always detects legendrian knot type .",
    "there are multiple examples of left hand @xmath19 torus knots that are of different legendrian types yet still have cube number equal to arc index .",
