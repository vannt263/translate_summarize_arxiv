    "the gauge / gravity duality  @xcite allows us to map a strongly interacting quantum field theory to a weakly coupled gravity theory living in a higher dimensional spacetime .",
    "the applications of the gauge / gravity duality have been extended to various fields in recent years , especially in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "a well known example is the holographic superconductor model  @xcite . by introducing a charged scalar field coupled to a @xmath0 dimensional einstein - maxwell theory with a negative cosmological constant ,",
    "this model admits a second order phase transition . at high temperature ,",
    "the scalar field vanishes and one obtains the standard ads reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "however , when one lowers the temperature , the ads reissner - nordstrm black hole becomes unstable and is replaced by a charged black hole with a non - trivial scalar  hair \" .",
    "the higher temperature ads reissner - nordstrm black hole describes a conductor phase , while the low temperature black hole solution has the expected behavior for a superconducting phase . since the condensed field is a scalar field dual to a scalar operator in the field theory side , it is therefore a holographic s - wave superconductor model .",
    "holographic p - wave models were realized by the condensation of a vector like field  @xcite , while holographic d - wave models were built up by introducing a charged spin two field propagating in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , some novel properties of qcd matter in a strong magnetic field have been revealed recently , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review .",
    "in particular , the qcd vacuum may undergo a phase transition to an exotic phase with charged @xmath1-meson condensed in a sufficiently strong magnetic field , which is a kind of anisotropic superconducting phase  @xcite .",
    "similar phenomenon has been also studied by holography based on the sakai - sugimoto model  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the holographic @xmath1-meson studied in the confined phase at zero temperature  @xcite suggests that the effective mass of the @xmath1-meson would become tachyonic in a sufficiently strong magnetic field , which gives rise to the condensate of the @xmath1-meson in a strong magnetic field . in principle , the holographic p - wave model proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite can also describe the condensate of the @xmath1-meson in low energy qcd .",
    "in a recent paper  @xcite , we constructed a holographic model with vector condensate in the einstein - maxwell - complex vector field theory in @xmath0 dimensional spacetime . in this model",
    "there exists a non - minimal coupling between the complex vector field and the maxwell field . working in the probe limit",
    ", we found that there is a critical temperature below which the charged vector condenses via a second order phase transition .",
    "the dc conductivity becomes infinite and the ac conductivity develops a gap in the condensed phase . in addition , it was found that the background magnetic field can induce the condensate of the vector field even in the case without chemical potential / charge density . in the case with non - vanishing charge density",
    ", the transition temperature raises with the applied magnetic field , and the condensate of the charged vector operator forms a vortex lattice structure in the spatial directions perpendicular to the applied magnetic field .",
    "thus , this model is also relevant to the @xmath1-meson condensate in an applied magnetic field . in a follow up paper  @xcite we studied the model in some detail by taking into account the back reaction of matter fields on a black hole background geometry . depending on the mass and charge of the vector field",
    ", we found that not only second order , but also first order and zeroth order phase transitions exist in this model .",
    "in particular the so - called  retrograde condensation \" can also appear , there the hairy black hole solution exists only for the temperature above a critical value , its free energy is much larger than the one of the black hole without the vector hair . for details",
    "please see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the previous studies , we limited ourselves to the black hole background , which corresponds to a dual field theory in the deconfined phase in a finite temperature , according to the gauge / gravity duality .",
    "it is worth generalizing our study to the ads soliton background case dual to a field theory in the confined phase .",
    "such a study can not only shed lights on the p - wave insulator / superconductor transition at zero temperature , but also is relevant to the condensate of @xmath1-meson appearing in a confined phase . in this model",
    "the background magnetic field is from the u(1 ) gauge field , so we shall call it abelian magnetic field for convenience .",
    "the black hole instability induced by a background non - abelian magnetic field coming from a su(2 ) gauge field has been reported in refs .",
    "@xcite where a vortex lattice structure forms due to the condensation of some non - abelian current operators . to distinguish our model with the p - wave model with su(2 ) gauge field  @xcite , we may call our model abelian p - wave model , while the latter non - abelian one . to compare two models",
    ", we will also investigate the ads soliton instability induced by non - abelian magnetic field in the non - abelian p - wave model .    to immerse the strongly coupled system into an external magnetic field background , we turn on a uniform magnetic field @xmath2 in the bulk .",
    "for the abelian p - wave model , we find that the increase of the abelian magnetic field will induce the instability of the ads soliton background .",
    "it is well known that the increase of the chemical potential can induce the instability of the ads soliton background , which mimics the insulator / superconductor transition in many holographic s - wave  @xcite and non - abelian p - wave  @xcite models .",
    "the magnetic field here plays the same role as the chemical potential and a family of condensate can be induced by the applied magnetic field in the dual strongly coupled system .",
    "although there is a tower of  droplet \" solutions in the sense that they are localized in a finite region for finite magnetic field  @xcite , it is quite different from the s - wave soliton case  @xcite , where the presence of the magnetic field causes the phase transition much more difficult .",
    "we then study the non - abelian p - wave model in the ads soliton background with constant magnetic field .",
    "similarly , the non - abelian magnetic field can also induce the ads soliton instability .",
    "in particular , if we take the mass of the charged vector field to be zero and the non - minimal coupling constant between the charged vector field and the maxwell gauge field to be one , we find that in the setup of the present paper , the reduced equations of motion of the abelian p - wave model are exactly the same as those of the non - abelian model . in this sense",
    ", the einstein - maxwell - complex vector field model can be viewed as a generalization of the su(2 ) p - wave model .",
    "we also manage to construct the vortex lattice solution in the condensed phase near the transition point , which is very reminiscent of the abrikosov lattice in the common type - ii superconductors .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : abeliabmodel ] , we first introduce the holographic model with a complex vector field charged under a u(1 ) gauge field in the ads soliton background .",
    "we turn on a uniform magnetic field and give details about how to recover the landau levels of the vector field in this holographic model .",
    "then we study the phase diagram . in section  [",
    "sect : nonabeliabmodel ] , we investigate the magnetic field effect for the non - abelian p - wave model in the ads soliton background .",
    "we construct the general vortex lattice solutions in section  [ sect : vortex ] for both two models . the conclusion and further discussions are included in section  [ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we study the ads soliton instabilities induced by an applied magnetic field in the einstein - maxwell - complex vector field theory .",

    "this is the probe limit we will adopt in this paper . since we want to study the phase transition in the confined phase , the background geometry is taken to be a @xmath3-dimensional ads soliton @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the tip of the soliton .",

    "is not important , since the charge @xmath8 of the vector field @xmath9 can be scaled to be one in the probe limit . ]",
    "therefore , the presence of a non - abelian magnetic field can also make the ads soliton background unstable . in some sense ,",
    "the einstein - maxwell - complex vector field model is a generalization of the su(2 ) model to a general mass square @xmath112 and gyromagnetic ratio @xmath15 of the vector field .",
    "the phase diagram in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath96 is drawn in figure  [ phasemub ] .",
    "the critical chemical potential above which a condensed phase appears decreases with the applied magnetic field , which means the presence of magnetic field can enhance rather than suppress the phase transition .",
    "this result is reminiscent of the condensation of @xmath197-meson  @xcite and @xmath1-meson  @xcite in a strong magnetic field .",
    "of course , this result is opposite to the well known behavior reported in ordinary superconductors as well as holographic s - wave superconductor / insulator model  @xcite , there the presence of an applied magnetic field will suppress the superconducting phase transition .",
    "remember that the action   describes a p - wave model , and that for the p - wave superconductors , theoretical studies  @xcite as well as experimental evidences  @xcite suggest the possibility that the magnetic field can induce superconductivity in some cases , in particular , for the ferromagnetic superconductors .",
    "therefore our results are understandable .    in the present study , we limited ourselves to the probe approximation by neglecting the back reaction of matter fields on the bulk ads soliton geometry , which may work only near the critical point with continuous phase transition .",
    "although it does be able to reveal some significant properties , something would be lost in this approximation , especially for the whole phase structure , see ref .",
    "@xcite as an example .",
    "indeed , in the black hole background case , going beyond the probe approximation , we found a rich phase structure in this einstein - maxwell - complex vector field model  @xcite .",
    "depending on mass square @xmath112 and charge @xmath8 , the phase transition can be zeroth order , first order or second order .",
    "in addition , there also exists the so - called  retrograde condensation \" .",
    "the behavior of entanglement entropy in this model has also been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in some sense ,",
    "although the einstein - maxwell - complex vector model looks to be a generalization of the su(2 ) p - wave model , it can have much rich phase structure and distinguished properties compared to the latter .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to go beyond the probe limit in the soliton background .",
    "our ongoing work shows that this model has much more interesting behaviors in the soliton background .",
    "the einstein - maxwell - complex vector field model described by the action ( [ action ] ) is just a phenomenological model . at the moment",
    "it is not sure whether this model can be embedded into some effective theory of string / m theory .",
    "if the answer is yes , it is certainly of great interest to understand those interesting properties of the model from the dual field theory side",
    ". this must be quite helpful to understand some high temperature superconductors and qcd vacuum in strong magnetic field .",
