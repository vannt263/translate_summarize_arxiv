    "before the lanuch of _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , there was no millisecond pulsar ( msp ) known as @xmath0ray emitter .",
    "thanks to the sensitivity of the _ large area telescope _ ( lat ) onboard _ fermi _ , a group of eight @xmath0ray msps has been discovered shortly after its operation commenced ( abdo et al .",
    "since then , the population of @xmath0ray emitting msps continues to rise . in the second _ fermi _ lat catalog of pulsars ( abdo et al .",
    "2013 ) , among 117 @xmath0ray pulsars detected at high significance , 40 of them are msps and therefore form a definite class of @xmath1-ray sources .    in the second _ fermi_-lat source catalog ( 2fgl ; nolan et al .",
    "2012 ) , 31% of the @xmath1-ray objects are unassociated with any known object .",
    "these unidentified _ fermi _ objects has formed the second largest class in 2fgl catalog . among all these unidentified @xmath1-ray objects ,",
    "a number of them can possibly be msps .",
    "these @xmath1-ray sources effectively provide a  treasure map \" for pulsation searches with radio telescopes . as the angular resolution of lat",
    "is much improved in comparison with its predecessors , most @xmath1-ray sources can be localized to a region small enough to allow radio pulsar searches with a minimal number of telescope pointings .",
    "this strategy has been demonstrated to be fruitful as a large number of msps has been discovered through this method ( see ray et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that blind pulsation searches for msps are computational demanding . since most of the msps reside in binary systems , the dimension of the parameter space for searching",
    "is therefore increased with the orbital parameters .",
    "furthermore , the fast rotation of msps requires an accurate knowledge of their positions for pulsation searches .",
    "however , even with the improved angular resolution of lat , the positional uncertainties of the cataloged @xmath1-ray objects ( typically a few arcmin ) are still too large for constraining the msp positions . without additional information ,",
    "blind pulsation searches require a fine scan of position over the error boxes of these msp candidates . for @xmath1-ray pulsation search , as very long integration time",
    "is required , the proper motion is also needed to be taken into account .    for facilitating the msp searches ,",
    "multiwavelength observations play an important role in allevitating the aforementioned problems .",
    "in particular , msps are known to be x - ray emitters . for isolated msps ,",
    "the x - ray emission can come from the hot polar cap regions and/or the synchrotron radiation from the magnetospheric accelerator ( e.g. cheng & zhang 1999 ) .",
    "among all the newly discovered msps , a considerable fraction of them has shown radio eclipses ( robert 2013 ) .",
    "these systems have very tight orbits with an orbital period less than a day ( cf .",
    "table  1 in roberts 2013 ) .",
    "depending on the masses of their companions @xmath2 , these systems are dubbed as  black widows \" ( @xmath3 ) or  redbacks \" ( @xmath4 ) ( for a recent views on these systems , please refer to hui 2014 ) . for such interacting binaries",
    ", x - ray emission can be produced through intrabinary shocks and can be orbitally modulated .",
    "therefore , one can constrain the position of the msp candidates to an arcsecond accuracy by searching for possible x - ray counterpart within the @xmath1-ray error box .",
    "if the identified x - ray sources show similar emission properties ( e.g. spectral properties , @xmath1-ray to x - ray flux ratio , variability ) to those of known msps , they are considered to be promising candidates .",
    "identifying possible optical counterparts with a spectrum / color similar to a late - type star / white dwarf can help us further narrow down the possible candidates .",
    "for the msps in binaries , the optical emission is originated from their companions which are heated by the relativistic wind outflow from the pulsars .",
    "this leads to the optical orbital modulation as seen in black widows / redbacks .",
    "if such an orbital period can be found from a candidate , this will make the pulsation search easier by reducing one dimension in the parameter space .",
    "the accurate optical positions can further help in constraining the position of msp candidates .    to sum up , if a candidate counterpart lies in the @xmath1-ray positional error box of a pre - selected unidentified _",
    "_ object with x - ray / optical properties comparable with known black widow / redback systems and shows modulation with a period less than a day , it is very likely to be a new black widow / redback msp .",
    "two remarkably successful examples of msps identified through this scheme are 2fgl  j2339.6 - 0532 ( romani & shaw 2011 ; kong et al .",
    "2012 ) and 2fgl  1311.7 - 3429 ( romani 2012 ) . in this study ,",
    "we present a systematic search for possible msp candidates in the 2fgl catalog through a detailed x - ray / optical identification campaign .",
    "in order to identify @xmath1-ray sources as msp candidates , we scanned over the 2fgl catalog and selected object if it satisfies all the following four criteria : ( 1 ) unassociated source locates at a galactic latitude @xmath5 ; ( 2 ) its variability index ( i.e. the parameter ` variability\\_index ` in 2fgl ) is less than 41 ; ( 3 ) a curved spectrum ( in contrast to a simple power - law ) is required in the fitting at significance larger than @xmath6 ( i.e. the parameter ` curve\\_significance ` in 2fgl ) ; ( 4 ) the source detection significance ( i.e. the parameter ` detection\\_significance ` in 2fgl ) is larger than @xmath7 ( cf .",
    "nolan et al . 2012 ; romani 2012 ; ackermann et al .",
    "2012 ; kong et al .",
    "2012 ) .    condition ( 1 ) is imposed as msps are old objects and they should be far away from the galactic plane which is presumably their birth places . for a 2fgl source with ` variability\\_index ` @xmath8 , the probability of it to be a steady source is @xmath9 ( nolan et al .",
    "therefore , we have imposed condition ( 2 ) so as to eliminate the highly variable sources such as blazars . since the @xmath1-ray spectra of pulsars are typically described by a curved model with a form of exponentially cutoff power - law ( cf .",
    "abdo et al .",
    "2013 ) , condition ( 3 ) can further enhance the chance of the selected sources as a pulsar .",
    "the last condition ensures the selected sources to be bright enough so that their positions and other physical parameters ( e.g. @xmath1-ray flux ) have been properly constrained .",
    "seven candidates are selected in accordance with these criteria .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ 2fgl ] which are arranged in the order of increasing right ascension .",
    "apart from the sources in table  [ 2fgl ] , 2fgl  j1227.1 - 4853 , 2fgl j1311.7 - 3429 and 2fgl j2339.6 - 0532 also fulfill our selection criteria . however , we found that these three sources have already identified as msps ( bassa et al .",
    "2014 ; romani 2012 ; ray et al .",
    "2013 ; kong et al .",
    "2012 ) . and",
    "therefore , these three sources will not be considered in our study .    in figure  [ c_v_plot ]",
    ", we compare the distribution of ` variability\\_index ` and ` curve\\_significance ` of our selected targets with that of the known agns , non - recycled pulsars and msps at @xmath5 and have ` detection\\_significance`@xmath10 . all the selected targets are found in a region occupied by the msps which justifies our adopted selection criteria .",
    "for the 30 known msps in this region , only 4 of them are isolated .",
    "this demonstrates our adopted scheme can be effective in spotting msps in binaries . on the other hand , 5 young / non - recycled pulsars and an agn",
    "are also found in this region .      to search for the possible x - ray counterparts associated with our short - listed 2fgl sources , we utilized archival x - ray spectral imaging data and looked for all the x - ray sources which lie within their @xmath1-ray positional uncertainties .",
    "very recently , the third _ fermi _ @xmath0ray point sources catalog ( 3fgl ) has been released ( acero et al . 2015 ) . with four years lat data",
