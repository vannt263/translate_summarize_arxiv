    "the x  ray pulsar  ( @xmath12  ms ) was discovered by gotthelf et al .  ( 2000 ) at the center of the composite supernova remnant  ( g29.70.3 ) . up to now , no radio detection of  has been reported , with an upper limit of @xmath13  mjy at 1.5  ghz ( kaspi et al .",
    "all the information on the pulsar timing parameters has been determined through observations in the x  ray band .",
    "gotthelf et al .  ( 2000 ) obtained a period derivative of @xmath14  s  s@xmath4 , by comparing five period measurements obtained with the  and  satellites in the years from 1993 to 2000 . assuming the canonical relation for the spin - down by magnetic dipole radiation , these values lead to an estimate for the magnetic field of @xmath15  g , above the quantum critical field and in the range of the highest values observed in radio pulsars .",
    "even more remarkably , the characteristic age of , @xmath9  years , is the smallest one of any known pulsar .",
    "the association of  with the supernova remnant  can be regarded as almost certain : the pulsar is located at the geometrical center of the @xmath16 diameter shell ( collins , gotthelf & helfand 2002 ) and is powering a bright radio / x  ray nebula that gives the composite morphology to this supernova remnant .",
    "the estimate of the age of  is subject to a large uncertainty . assuming that the shell is still in the freely expanding phase with velocity @xmath17 , the age is @xmath18  years , where @xmath19 is the distance normalized to the value of 19  kpc , estimated for  with 21  cm observations ( becker & helfand 1984 ) . alternatively ,",
    "if the remnant is already in the sedov phase , the age can be estimated by the relation between the radius and the shock temperature inferred from the x  ray spectra . in this way blanton & helfand ( 1996 ) derived an age of @xmath20  years , based on the temperature of 0.5  kev measured with .",
    "it thus appears that the pulsar characteristic age is smaller than the age of , although the large uncertainties involved do not allow agreement between the two values to be precluded .",
    "the location of  was observed twice with the  satellite in march 2001 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the instrument relevant for the observations reported here is the medium - energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ) , that operates in the 1.810  kev energy range , providing a good spatial ( @xmath21 full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) ) and energy resolution ( @xmath22% fwhm at 6  kev ) over a circular field of view with a diameter of @xmath23 ( boella et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the main target of the first observation ( a ) was the pulsar ax  j18440258 , therefore  was detected at an off - axis angle of @xmath24 ( results on ax  j18440258 will be reported elsewhere ) . the second observation ( b )",
    "was pointed on the kes 75 supernova remnant .",
    "both observations lasted about 2.5  days , but earth occultations and passage of the satellite in regions of high particle background resulted in net exposure times of 83.7  ks and 105.3  ks for the mecs instrument .      for the timing analysis we used only counts with energy greater than 3",
    "kev in order to reduce the contribution of the soft emission from the supernova remnant . for observation",
    "b we used a circular extraction region with radius @xmath25 ( resulting in 15904 counts ) , while for observation a we used an elliptical region matched to the shape of the off - axis mecs point spread function ( 3751 counts ) .",
    "the times of arrival were converted to the solar system barycenter using the source position r.a.@xmath26 , dec.@xmath27 ( j2000 ) .",
    "we first analyzed the two observations separately , using a folding program to search over a grid of period ( @xmath28 ) and period derivative ( @xmath29 ) values and adopting the method described in leahy ( 1987 ) to determine the best period and its uncertainty .",
    "since the individual observations are relatively short compared to the pulsar spin - down timescale , the period values giving the highest signal do not depend significantly on @xmath29 .",
    "we therefore fixed @xmath29 to the value @xmath30  s  s@xmath4 ( gotthelf et al .",
    "2000 ) obtaining the period values reported in table  1 .",
    "the light curve obtained from observation b is shown , for different energy ranges , in fig .  1 .",
    "the difference between the periods measured in the two observations corresponds to @xmath31  s  s@xmath4 which is , within the errors , compatible with the value found from the  and  data spanning the years 19932000 ( gotthelf et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the accuracy of the  satellite clock is good enough to combine the two observations ( taken about 15 days apart ) into a single data set , thus allowing us to derive a smaller error on @xmath28 and to directly measure @xmath29 .",
    "this was again done by folding the data on a grid of @xmath28 and @xmath29 trial values , leading to @xmath5  ms and @xmath32  s  s@xmath4 , where the values refer to the epoch mjd=51991.08778 .",
    "these results are consistent with an extrapolation of the timing solution derived by gotthelf et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .      for the spectral analysis we used only observation b that provided data of better quality since  was detected on - axis , where the mecs instrument has the greatest sensitivity and the best spectral and spatial performances .",
    "moreover , we used also data from the lecs instrument ( parmar et al . 1997 ) that covers the soft energy range down to 0.1 kev .    for the source spectrum extraction we used first a circle of radius 4@xmath33 for the mecs and 8@xmath33 for the lecs in order to maximize the contribution from both the supernova remnant and the pulsar nebula emission .",
    "the background spectrum was estimated from a circular corona between 4.7@xmath33 and 9.5@xmath33 for the mecs and between 8@xmath33 and 10.6@xmath33 for the lecs .",
    "the source spectra were rebinned in order to have at least 30 counts per channel .",
    "we verified that a fit with a power - law only fails to describe the data ( @xmath34/d.o.f .",
    "= 463/404 ) , giving strong residuals corresponding to the presence of the emission lines of si xiii ( 1.84 kev ) and s xv ( 2.45 kev ) . we therefore fitted the spectra using a combination of a power law and an optically thin thermal plasma ( mekal in the xspec softare package v.11 ) , plus an interstellar absorption of morrison and mccammon ( 1983 ) .",
    "this combination of models is known to be appropriate for kes 75 , because it also takes into account the presence of a thermal shell ( blanton & helfand 1996 ) .",
    "this model produced a very good fit ( @xmath34/d.o.f .",
    "= 398/402 ) with the following parameters : interstellar absorption @xmath35 @xmath2 , photon index @xmath36 , plasma temperature @xmath37 kev .",
    "this best - fit is shown in fig .",
    "the thermal and non - thermal fluxes in the 0.12 kev range are respectively @xmath38 and @xmath39 erg @xmath2 s@xmath4 , while the corresponding values in the 210 kev band are @xmath40 and @xmath41 erg @xmath2 s@xmath4 .",
    "the contribution of the thermal component to the flux density drops below 10% of the total above 3 kev . to further constrain the spectrum of the nebula",
    ", we have repeated the analysis using the data collected from a smaller circle ( 2@xmath33 radius ) , and fixing the temperature of the thermal component and the interstellar absorption to the values obtained previously .",
    "this resulted in a best - fit with @xmath42 ( @xmath34/d.o.f.=348/317 ) .",
    "the non - thermal unabsorbed flux in the 210 kev band is @xmath43 erg @xmath2 s@xmath4 .",
    "these results are consistent with ( and have smaller uncertainties than ) those obtained by blanton & helfand ( 1996 ) with that , similarly to our instrument , did not have enough spatial resolution to disentangle the contribution from the shell and the central pulsar / nebula .",
    "we also examined the pulsar spectrum in two different phase intervals corresponding to the high and low parts of the pulse profile , finding marginal evidence for a hardening in correspondence of pulse maximum .",
    "this indicates that the surrounding diffuse x  ray nebula , giving a higher relative contribution during the phase of low pulsed emission , has a spectrum softer than that of the pulsar .",
    "in fact , the preliminary _ chandra _ results reported by collins et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , yield a power law photon index of @xmath81.5 for the pulsar and @xmath81.9 for the nebula .",
    "the period measurement derived with , together with past measurements ( as from table  1 in gotthelf et al .",
    "2000 ) , allows an analysis of the rotation history of  in the past decade .",
    "all together , there are now 6 different measurements , of which ours is that with the smallest uncertainty ( just 12% of the average of all the others ) . in the case of a smooth evolution represented with a quadratic function , of the form    @xmath44    a reasonable representation of the data",
    "can be achieved with the best fit parameters reported in the first column of table  2 ( @xmath45 , for 3 d.o.f . ;",
    "residuals are plotted in fig .",
    "the best fit second derivative of the frequency @xmath46 is significantly different from 0 .",
    "in fact a linear fit ( @xmath47 ) can be safely ruled out , as shown by the extremely high @xmath34 value ( @xmath48 , for 4 d.o.f . ) .",
    "we also note that the residuals of a linear fit ( fig .",
    "3.a ) are too large to be accounted for by timing noise , even assuming for  a particularly high activity parameter ( see , e.g. , arzoumanian et al .",
    "1994 ) .    under the hypothesis that no glitch has occurred over the time spanned by the period measurements ,",
    "the available data can be used to determine the braking index @xmath10 , defined by the law @xmath49 and evaluated , in terms of the frequency and its first two derivatives , as @xmath50 .",
    "the values of the quadratic fit correspond to a braking index @xmath7 , significantly lower than the canonical value ( @xmath6 ) for magnetic dipole losses . for a braking law @xmath49 ,",
    "the pulsar age is :    @xmath51.\\ ] ]    assuming an originally fast spinning pulsar ( @xmath52 ) , we derive for an age @xmath53  yr .",
    "the quoted accuracy on @xmath54 relies on the assumption that irregularities in the spin evolution are negligible in the range of epochs spanned by the observations .",
    "in particular , if found that one or more glitches have occurred in between period measurements , the above estimates should be revised . although population studies indicate small initial periods for radio pulsars ( bhattacharya et al .",
    "1992 , lorimer et al . 1993 ) and a value of @xmath55  ms is generally accepted for the crab pulsar , there is now considerable evidence that fairly long initial spin periods may be common ( see , e.g. , torii et al . 1999 , kaspi et al .",
    "2001 , murray et al .",
    "we therefore show in fig .  4 ( solid line ) , how the age derived from equation ( 1 ) depends on the assumed value of @xmath56 .",
    "the data can also be interpreted by considering the possibility that glitches occurred between the observations .",
    "for instance , let us first consider the case of a glitch between the first ( october 1993 ) and the second ( march 1999 ) measurements by comparing the october 1993 value with the extrapolation of a fit to the subsequent measurements .",
    "a quadratic fit to the last five points gives a poorly constrained @xmath46 ( corresponding to @xmath57 ; see column ( 2 ) in table  2 ) . the estimated magnitude and even the sign of the glitch",
    "actually depend on the value of the braking index .",
    "the best fit ( @xmath58 ) corresponds to a negative jump in frequency , a behavior opposite to what seen in all glitching radio pulsars ( lyne et al .",
    "a conventional sign is obtained only for @xmath11 , which being at only @xmath59 from the best fit , has a non negligible probability .",
    "another possibility is the occurrence of a glitch at a later time .",
    "in fact the residuals in fig .",
    "3.b show a pattern suggesting a glitch in an epoch between the third and fourth data point .",
    "we have then chosen 51500.0  mjd as a possible epoch of this glitch : any different choice of the epoch , within the time interval between the third and fourth data point , will have the only effect of slightly changing the best parameters for the glitch , therefore not changing any of the conclusions that we shall draw below .    for different values of the braking index ,",
    "we have fitted separately the former and latter set of three data points .",
    "we find that for values of @xmath10 larger than about 2.5 we would again come out with an unlikely `` anti - glitch '' .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath10 smaller than about 1.8 the ( negative ) @xmath60 should increase , and also this behavior is in contrast with what seen in radio pulsars ( lyne et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the allowed range for @xmath10 ( 1.8,2.5 )",
    ", the @xmath34 value is monotonically decreasing for increasing @xmath10 , but the trend is so shallow that by itself it can not be taken as a valid argument for preferring higher values of @xmath10 .",
    "the parameters for the two limit cases are shown in columns ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of table  2 , and the corresponding pulsar ages by the dashed lines of fig .",
    "if a glitch at about mjd 51500 actually occurred , how does it compare with known glitches in other pulsars ?",
    "5 shows the positions , in the parameter plane @xmath61@xmath62 of all glitches known in radio pulsars for which both @xmath63 and @xmath64 have been measured ( as from lyne et al .",
    "superposed is the locus of the points representing the mjd 51500 glitch , for different values of @xmath10 .",
    "it is apparent that the required glitch has rather normal parameters , with both @xmath61 and @xmath62 somehow smaller than the average .",
    "we have presented a new accurate measurement of the spin frequency of the young pulsar  associated to the  supernova remnant . combined with previous data , and making some hypothesis on the glitch history of our new frequency measurement",
    "can be interpreted in different ways .",
    "a simple possibility , assuming no glitches in the years 19932001 , is in terms of a timing solution with @xmath65  hz  s@xmath66 .",
    "this results in a braking index @xmath7 and an estimate for the age of  more in accord with that of the associated supernova remnant ( unless the pulsar initial period was close to the current one ) .",
    "other likely possibilities involve a single glitch with reasonable parameters and lead to a wide range of acceptable ages .",
    "if the glitch occurred near mjd 51500 the resulting braking index @xmath10 is in the range 1.82.5 , while for a glitch between october 1993 and march 1999 we can only get a lower limit of @xmath11 .",
    "braking indices have so far been measured only for five pulsars . except for psr j111967 which has @xmath67 ( camilo et al .",
    "2000 ) , all of them have @xmath10 significantly smaller than 3 , similar to the values suggested by our analysis for .",
    "such values are @xmath68 ( crab pulsar ; lyne , pritchard & graham - smith 1993 ) , @xmath69 ( psr b150958 ; kaspi et al .",
    "1994 ) , @xmath70 ( vela pulsar ; lyne et al .",
    "1996 ) , and @xmath71 ( psr b054069 ; zhang et al .",
    "2001 ) .    the pulsar with the highest glitch rate ( about one per year ) in the sample studied by lyne et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , is psr b173730 , which is also the one with the highest magnetic field ( @xmath72  g ) .",
    "we can not exclude that  had more than one glitch in the eight years spanned by the observations , but in this case no information on @xmath10 can be derived from our data .",
    "interestingly , the glitch parameters we inferred for  in fig .",
    "5 are similar to those observed in psr b173730",
    ". a finer monitoring in the future will establish whether  is indeed similar to psr b173730 .    as already mentioned by gotthelf et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the @xmath28 and @xmath29 values of  are very similar to those of the radio pulsar psr  j11196127 ( @xmath73  ms , @xmath74  s  s@xmath4 , camilo et al .",
    "a remarkable difference between these two young and energetic pulsars ( @xmath75  erg  s@xmath4 ) is the lack of a bright pulsar wind nebula around psr j11196127 ( crawford et al .",
    "these authors suggested that high magnetic field pulsars produce radio nebulae that fade rapidly , an interpretation apparently contradicted by the brightness of the  core .",
    "if the value @xmath76 is confirmed for , the difference in the brightness of the wind nebulae of these two pulsars might be related to their different braking index values ( @xmath67 for psr j11196127 ; camilo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ) .",
    "while spin - down by magnetic dipole radiation yields @xmath6 , a value @xmath77 is expected if the pulsar braking is driven by the presence of a strong relativistic wind , which could also have an effect on the emission from a surrounding nebula .",
