    "the celebrated volume conjecture of kashaev @xcite and murakami and murakami @xcite claims that the colored jones polynomial determines the volume of a hyperbolic knot complement .",
    "this conjecture is wide open .",
    "recall that the colored jones polynomial of a knot @xmath1 is a sequence of one variable laurent polynomials @xmath2 indexed by a positive integer @xmath3 , the color . for @xmath4 , the normalized version of @xmath2 , @xmath5 ,",
    "it is the classical jones polynomial .    by using results of lackenby , agol and thurston @xcite we showed in @xcite that there is a volume - ish theorem for the jones polynomial of alternating knots : the volume of a hyperbolic alternating knot is linearity bounded by the sum of the absolute values of the second leading and the second lowest coefficient of the jones polynomial @xmath6 .    here",
    "we will extend our results to the colored jones polynomial of alternating knots .",
    "we will show that in this case the colored jones polynomial has a well defined head and tail : the leading three and the lowest three coefficients are independent of the color , for @xmath7 .",
    "it turns out that these coefficients have a particular nice form and can easily be computed .",
    "it is interesting to note , though , that the third coefficient of the colored jones polynomial @xmath8 is in general not determined by the jones polynomial @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , the coefficients that gave rise to the volume - ish theorem for the jones polynomial persists in all the colored jones polynomials : the second leading coefficient and the second lowest coefficient are independent of the color . as a corollary",
    "we will get a volume - ish theorem for the colored jones polynomial , independent of the color @xmath3 .",
    "thus there is indeed a deeper connection between the colored jones polynomial and the volume of hyperbolic knots , at least for alternating knots .",
