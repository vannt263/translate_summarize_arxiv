    "having had the honor of presenting status reports at two of the last three heidelberg meetings on tev gamma - ray astronomy @xcite , @xcite , i am painfully aware ( with the benefit of hindsight ) of my shortcomings at such a task , in particular at my attempts to predict the future growth of the field where i have generally erred on the conservative side and have been pleasantly surprised by the pace of discovery .",
    "hence here i will confine myself to reporting on the status of the field as i know it today ( july , 2008 ) which will therefore rely mostly on my knowledge of the published papers and recent excellent reviews @xcite , @xcite , @xcite as well as the comprehensive white paper on tev ground - based gamma - ray astronomy that was recently put together by members of the us tev gamma - ray community @xcite .",
    "i will attempt to summarize the status and capability of the various observatories , outline the sensitivity that can be achieved with existing instrumentation , the range of observed phenomena , make some attempt to catalog the credible discrete sources reported to date , and provide some personal perspective on the progress of , and prospects for , the field .",
    "i will make no attempt to describe the significant improvements that are planned for existing observatories , some of which are in an advanced state of construction .",
    "nothing dates more rapidly than a written status report .",
    "this is particularly true of one presented at the beginning of a symposium where the most exciting results from the various groups have been embargoed so that they can be presented at the symposium .",
    "thus even before the ink on the report is dry , it is out - of - date .",
    "its value therefore is merely to serve as a historical benchmark and to summarize what one of us thought he knew at the start of the symposium and to provide some kind of reference point for future developments .",
    "with the notable exception of the remarkable results from the milagro experiment @xcite , the bulk of the observational results at tev energies have come from telescopes using the atmospheric cherenkov technique .",
    "although the basic technique was developed some fifty years ago , it was not until the development of the so - called imaging atmospheric cherenkov technique ( iact ) that the first indication of a credible detection was apparent @xcite , @xcite . given the rather murky history that has characterized the early results at all gamma - ray energies ( 100 mev energies as well as 1 tev energies ) , it is not surprising that this early detection was treated with some skepticism .    in its earliest manifestation",
    "the technique was characterized by its :    * simplicity * economy * elegance    although the early experiments ( an example , the first whipple observatory experiment shown in figure [ searchlights ] ) did not succeed in producing convincing evidence for the existence of any sources , they showed that it was possible for small groups to participate in the exciting new field of high energy astrophysics ; this field was soon to be dominated by elaborate and expensive experiments in balloons or on satellites .",
    "the elegance of the cherenkov technique was apparent in its economy as to the energy intercepted that was necessary to detect the gamma ray ; as ken greisen pointed out , the ground - based technique is remarkable in that only one millionth of the energy of the primary gamma ray ( in the form of cherenkov light photons ) need be collected by the telescope for the gamma ray to be detected .",
    "the imaging atmospheric cherenkov technique as practiced today ( figure [ veritas ] ) with its multitude of pixels , multiple large optical reflectors , and high speed data acquisition systems is certainly not simple . of necessity ,",
    "the costs of such systems are now large and prohibitive for small research programs .",
    "the typical state - of - the - art observatory costs $ 20 m and authorship lists are in the hundreds .",
    "only the elegance survives and still makes the technique attractive to cosmic ray physicists and refugees from large high energy physics experiments .    .",
    "each of the four telescopes has an aperture of 12 m ( collection area of 106m@xmath0 ) and a camera with 499 pixels . ]    with the current emphasis on `` green '' technology it is perhaps worth noting that the detection of high energy particles using their secondary emissions in the atmosphere is inherently a `` green '' technique since in no way is the natural path of the gamma ray , destined to cross the wilderness of interstellar and perhaps intergalactic space and end its life by collision with an air molecule , disturbed .",
    "the gamma ray is not even aware it has been detected !",
    "in contrast the highly technical gamma - ray space telescope must intercept , and destroy , the primary gamma ray in its complex silicon layers ; it thus ends its life prematurely and catastrophically and never completes its original destiny .",
    "although all ground - based experiments that have the sensitivity to detect a source like the crab nebula can contribute to tev gamma - ray astronomy , the recent literature ( and this symposium ) has tended to be dominated by the `` big three '' , h.e.s.s . , magic and veritas .",
    "however cangaroo iii , the whipple 10 m telescope and the recently completed hagar in ladhak , india also play an important role , particularly in monitoring variable sources . some of the characteristics of these observatories are listed in table [ observatories ] .",
    "it should be noted that only three of the original four telescopes of cangaroo iii are now in operation so the sensitivity is reduced from the original designed threshold ( m. mori , private communication ) .",
    "the threshold shown for h.e.s.s .",
    "is that at first light and when most of their pioneering discoveries were made ; because of mirror weathering the threshold is now higher .",
    "hagar has only recently come on - line so its sensitivity has still to be confirmed ; this value and those for the other two indian experiments were supplied by b.s .",
    "acharya ( private communication ) .",
    "hagar is noteworthy in that it will be the first telescope to operate at an elevation @xmath1 4 km .",
    "of the eight observatories listed , all but hagar and pact use the iact ; their approach is to use wavefront sampling with an array of small telescopes",
    ".    .major existing act facilities [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "nearly fifty years ago the real pioneers of tev astronomy , chudakov and zatsepin in the u.s.s.r . and",
    "jelley and porter in the british isles , made their first brave venture into this now rich field of tev gamma - ray astronomy ; it was a major leap of faith since it was truly terra incognita .",
    "when these early experiments were planned , there were no known 100 mev sources ; indeed in 1960 there were no known x - ray sources and thus the known astrophysical electromagnetic spectrum beyond the earth effectively ended in the near ultraviolet .",
    "although the observation of the cosmic radiation was a clear indication that high energy particles must be accelerated somewhere , commonsense would have suggested that since the cosmic particles were observed to have a steeply falling energy spectrum , it was unlikely that the first high energy sources would be apparent at the high gamma - ray energies where the fluxes would be very low . as early as 1962 it was pointed out that photon - photon absorption might be a serious limitation for tev gamma - ray astronomy ( @xcite ) ; fortunately the optical cosmic photon density was overestimated and the gamma - ray horizon was not as near as these gloomy predictions indicated .",
    "the few models of tev source intensity that were proposed considered only pion production in hadron collisions and were speculative at best .",
    "in fact these early pioneers were either woefully ignorant of the astrophysics or extremely optimistic ; either way they had to have great self - confidence to feel that they had the ability to beat the odds !",
    "tev gamma - ray astronomy is now a mature science with cutting edge instruments , mature observatories , dedicated and experienced adherents , and catalogs of diverse sources .",
    "the question might then be asked why this discipline took so long to develop for , unlike its counterparts in the x - ray and 100 mev gamma - ray bands , it did not have to await the development of space technology . by 1980",
    "the concept for a new generation of telescope had already been proposed ( @xcite;@xcite;@xcite ; @xcite )    it may be that this second generation of astronomers were not imaginative enough or were too conservative to exploit the possibilities of these energy bands .",
    "but the slow progress must also be at least partially because the ground - based cherenkov technique was not easy to categorize and thus it was difficult for funding agencies to fit it into their normal modes of support for astrophysical research . at a time when `` gamma - ray astronomy '' was synonymous with space astronomy ( and",
    "support therefore assumed to come from national space agencies such as nasa ) , there was no natural conduit for serious funding .",
    "it was not really high energy physics , it was not space astronomy , it was not traditional cosmic ray astronomy and it required the dark high remote sites traditionally associated with optical astronomy .",
    "even the smithsonian astrophysical observatory , which , with internal funding , had been prepared to gamble on such ventures in the lush days of the sixties withdrew support in 1976 when it was apparent that the early results were not promising enough for nasa to support as providing useful complementary observations to the space missions .    the first real impetus to develop the iact in the usa came about as a direct result of the activity of neutrino astronomers who had a high profile and ready constituency of support from high energy physicists .",
    "in fact it was largely pressure from the neutrino astronomy community to build a major underwater telescope that led the high energy division of the u.s .",
    "department of energy to fund the pioneer effort in iact at the whipple observatory in 1982 .",
    "the thinking here was that if it could be demonstrated that there were no sources of tev gamma rays detected with this more sensitive , but relatively inexpensive , technique , then there would be little justification for the construction of the much more expensive neutrino telescopes .",
    "the slow development of the iact was thus justification for the agencies to delay the large investment necessary for the construction of large neutrino telescopes ; high energy physics funding could then be reserved for the perceived more interesting area of high energy particle research at accelerators .",
    "the subsequent success of the iact observatories has been a major impetus for the construction of the new generation of neutrino telescopes even though there is still not strong evidence that the progenitor particles in most tev gamma - ray sources are hadrons and therefore likely neutrino producers .",
    "the present plethora of sources at tev energies must mean that the prospects for fruitful research are bright for the coming epoch .",
    "if the number of participants means anything , then one can not but be impressed by the fact that hundreds of scientists ( if one is to judge by the list of authors ) have migrated into this field ; this is far in excess of the numbers at any previous epoch .",
    "although there is more than enough work to do with the present instrumentation it is important , and indeed inevitable , that some effort is devoted to the development of the technology necessary for a new generation of telescopes .",
    "it is easy to envisage the extension of the iact by simply multiplying the number of telescopes ; the difficulty is to do so economically .",
    "an n - fold increase in the number of telescopes ( and approximately in cost ) only results in an increase in sensitivity by a factor of n@xmath2 . in the absence of a major technical breakthrough",
    ", then we are entering into an era of extremely expensive ground - based observatories ; in fact the costs will begin to be in the same ballpark as the cost of building space telescopes .",
    "there is not a single driving scientific justification for this major upgrade in sensitivity but rather a desire to do better in all the areas currently being explored @xcite . in the current , rather gloomy , economic climate",
    "it will be a brave effort to seek funding in excess of a hundred million dollars or euros without a single critical scientific imperative ( like the nature of dark matter , the existence of dark energy or the meaning of life ! ) .",
    "however no such single mission objective existed for _ fermi _ ( glast ) either .",
    "two such efforts of iact construction are now under consideration : the largely european cta which aims to scale up the existing arrays and hopes to achieve savings by mass production , and the somewhat more innovative us agis which would attempt to develop a new approach to telescope and camera design .",
    "some might argue that all resources could be pooled so that one major observatory could be built with the maximum sensitivity .",
    "however while it makes sense to have as much cooperation as possible between such observatories , there is a strong argument to be made for at least two independent observatories using different technologies ( apart from the obvious one of needing two to fully cover both hemispheres ) .",
    "it is very important in extending a discipline into a new region of parameter space that marginal and threshold detections can be confirmed and that systematic effects be identified .",
    "agile and _ fermi _ are in this happy situation .",
    "given the wide range of phenomena that might be observed it is unlikely that the observation requirements can be satisfied by a single instrument without introducing serious compromises in its design . also since some four decades of the electromagnetic are available , it may be sensible to concentrate and optimize on particular bands .",
    "the large fields of view that are optimum for the study of extended galactic sources are generally wasteful for the study of point sources like agn .",
    "the mapping of supernovae remnants at high energies requires instruments with very large collection areas and high angular resolution .",
    "the ongoing observations using the iact will be complemented by the continued operation and extension of the ground - based particle arrays .",
    "these have already demonstrated that they are capable of detecting tev sources ; long integrations are possible because of their high duty cycle .",
    "they are particularly sensitive to extended sources .",
    "although the anticipated detection of transient sources has not materialized , the completion of hawc ( this symposium ) by the milagro group at a high elevation site in mexico will open new possibilities in this regard .",
    "given the fiscal realities of 2008 it will not be surprising if , for the next few years , the ground - based iact community must rely on incremental improvements to existing observatories , rather than order of magnitude scaling up to a new generation of observatories .",
    "it is somewhat disappointing that despite the success of the iact , no dramatic improvement in detection technique has been proposed .",
    "a moratorium imposed by the bleak economy may be advantageous in that the results obtained with the current observatories can be thoroughly considered , new technologies may be taken advantage of , and innovative ideas for new detection strategies fostered .    in the coming decade gamma - ray astronomy in the gev regime",
    "will surely be dominated by agile and _ fermi _ ; complementary observations by upgraded versions of the current ground - based observatories at energies in excess of 100 gev where the iact is most sensitive will extend the scientific impact of these missions and form a firm basis for new facilities , both in space and on the ground .",
    "my research is supported by grants from the u.s .",
    "department of energy , the u.s . national science foundation , and the smithsonian institution .",
    "participation in the heidelberg gamma - ray 2008 symposium was possible using personal funding sources .",
    "i am grateful to my veritas colleagues ( m.beilicke , p.cogan , d.horan , p.fortin , m. hui ) for supplying figures ahead of publication and to j.perkins for reading the manuscript ."
