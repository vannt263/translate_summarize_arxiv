    "matter - wave solitons have been created in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in various effectively one - dimensional ( 1d ) settings . first , these were dark solitons in repulsive condensates @xcite .",
    "then , bright solitons were created in an attractive bec ( lithium ) @xcite .",
    "this was followed by the making of gap solitons in a repulsive rubidium condensate loaded in a periodic potential , which was induced by the optical lattice ( ol ) , i.e. , interference pattern between two laser beams illuminating the medium @xcite .",
    "a challenge to the experiment is creation of 2d matter - wave solitons .",
    "a natural problem in this case is the trend of solitons in multidimensional attractive condensates to be unstable because of the possibility of collapse in this setting @xcite . in theoretical works ,",
    "several approaches were proposed to stabilize 2d solitons .",
    "one of them relies on the use of a full two - dimensional ol @xcite , or its low - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) counterpart @xcite , which can stabilize fundamental solitons .",
    "in addition , 2d lattices lend stability to vortical solitons @xcite , including higher - order vortices , and  super - vortex \" complexes @xcite ; the latter are built as circular chains of compact vortices , with global vorticity imposed on top of the chain .",
    "another theoretically elaborated approach relies upon the use of a nonlocal anisotropic nonlinearity induced by the long - range interactions between atoms with a magnetic momentum ( chromium ) , polarized by an external field @xcite .",
    "an alternative mechanism proposed for the stabilization of 2d matter - wave solitons is based on the feshbach resonance ( fr ) , which makes it possible to control the value of the scattering length , i.e. , as a matter of fact , an effective nonlinear coefficient in the corresponding gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , by means of an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fr may switch the sign of the nonlinearity ( in particular , the fr - induced switch from repulsion to weak attraction was instrumental to the creation of bright solitons in lithium @xcite ) .",
    "application of a low - frequency ac magnetic field may provide for periodic alternation of the nonlinearity sign in the gpe via the fr .",
    "it was predicted that the fr technique based on the ac field gives rise to novel states in the 1d geometry @xcite , and can stabilize 2d solitons , even in the absence of the external trap @xcite . the same technique ,",
    "if applied in combination with a quasi-1d ol potential , may also stabilize matter - wave solitons in the 3d geometry @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted @xcite , and demonstrated in experiment @xcite , that the fr can also be induced by a properly tuned optical field .",
    "then , illuminating the condensate by two counterpropagating coherent laser beams , one can build an ol that will provide for periodic modulation of the nonlinearity coefficient along the respective spatial coordinate .",
    "solitons in the corresponding one - dimensional gpe with the _ nonlinear _ ol were recently investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where stability regions for static solitons and breathers were found ( motion of free solitons in the same model was recently studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and rigorous proofs concerning the stability of static solutions in this setting were reported in work @xcite ) .",
    "the soliton dynamics in the 1d model with other configurations of the spatial modulation of the nonlinearity coefficient was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite ( unlike ref .",
    "@xcite , the nonlinearity coefficient did not change its sign in the models considered in the latter works ) .",
    "static spatial modulation of the nonlinearity through the fr , controlled by the properly shaped magnetic or optical field , may be tried as another means for the stabilization of 2d solitons , which is the subject of the present work .",
    "a natural form of am axisymmetric ol in the 2d geometry corresponds to the bessel beam , i.e. , a nondiffracting light signal in a bulk linear medium . in the case",
    "when the bessel beam creates an effective linear potential in the equation of the gpe type with self - attraction , it has been shown that the corresponding radial lattice can readily stabilize various types of 2d solitons @xcite .",
    "however , our results show that , within a broad parameter region that we were able to explore , stabilization of 2d solitons by means of a _ nonlinear _ bessel lattice , i.e. , within the framework of the gpe whose nonlinear coefficient is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the radial coordinate , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constants , and @xmath5 is the bessel function with @xmath6 , appears to be _",
    "impossible _  stationary axisymmetric soliton solutions can be easily constructed , but in simulations they all suffer either decay or collapse .    nevertheless , in this work we demonstrate that a simpler shape of the radial modulation of the nonlinearity , in which it takes a constant value , corresponding to self - attraction , inside a finite circle or annulus , and is zero ( or corresponds to self - repulsion ) outside this region , is able to stabilize axisymmetric 2d solitons .",
    "in addition to that , we will demonstrate that the model gives rise to _ bistability _ : the stationary solitons coexist with stable breathers , that feature persistent oscillations in the radial direction .",
    "in fact , the stability region of the breathers is larger than that of the static solitons , extending to higher values of the norm ( number of atoms in the bec ) .",
    "it should be said that , in the case of the nonlinearity controlled by the optical beam through the fr mechanism , the beam with the cross section in the form of a circle or annulus is not divergence - free , unlike its bessel - shaped counterpart .",
    "however , this circumstance does not impede the physical realization of the model , as an effectively 2d condensate can be easily trapped between two blue - detuned light sheets , which strongly repel the atoms , as demonstrated in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the thickness of the corresponding  pancake \" is a few microns , while its diameter is measured in hundreds of microns ( at least ) , hence the diffraction of the light beam within this range is completely negligible .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give the formulation of the model , and present numerical and analytical solutions for static solitons .",
    "the analytical part includes a variational approximation for the solutions in the general case , an exact solution for solitons supported by an infinitely narrow annulus carrying the nonlinearity , and predictions for the stability against radial perturbations , based on the vakhitov - kolokolov ( vk ) @xcite criterion .",
    "the stability threshold for azimuthal perturbations is determined by a solution of the corresponding eigenvalue problem .",
    "an inference is that stability borders in the model with the nonlinearity supported on the circle are completely determined by radial perturbations , while in the annular model the upper stability border ( in terms of the soliton s norm ) is controlled by azimuthal perturbations .",
    "no stable solitons are possible if the annulus is relatively narrow , with the ratio of inner and outer radii exceeding a critical value @xmath0 . in section 3",
    ", we summarize results of direct numerical simulations of the stability of fundamental stationary solutions , which precisely confirm the existence of a well - defined stability region of the 2d solitons in the model s parameter space , predicted in section 2 .",
    "the bistability ( coexistence of the stable stationary solitons and breathers ) and the extended stability region for the breathers are also reported in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we briefly consider solitons with intrinsic vorticity , and conclude that all the vortices are unstable ( the vortex splits in two fundamental solitons , each one then collapsing intrinsically ) .",
    "the paper is concluded by section 5 .",
    "the gpe for the single - atom wave function @xmath7 in the normalized form is @xmath8 the 2d laplacian , and the nonlinearity coefficient shaped , by means of the external magnetic or optical field , as said above : @xmath9 the number of atoms is determined by the norm of the wave function , @xmath10 using the scaling invariance of eq .",

    "however , we focus on the case with @xmath17 in these regions , as such a case is least favorable for the existence of solitons , hence it provides for results which are most relevant to the experimental realization of the scheme .",

    "the stability is limited to relatively broad annuli , with the ratio of the inner and outer radii smaller than a critical value , @xmath162 . moreover",
    ", the model gives rise to bistability , as the stationary solitons coexist with stable axisymmetric breathers .",
    "the stability region of the breathers extends , in terms of their norm , to values exceeding the critical value corresponding to the townes soliton .",
    "the collapse threshold strongly increases with the radius of the inner hole .",
    "vortex solitons were constructed too , but they are unstable .",
    "essentially the same results were obtained also for a model in which , outside of the circle or annulus , the nonlinearity is not zero but rather repulsive ( that case is not considered in the paper , as the configuration with the zero nonlinearity is the most challenging one , as concerns the stability of solitons ) .",
    "the results reported in this work suggest a straightforward possibility to create stable two - dimensional matter - wave solitons in bose - einstein condensates .",
    "we acknowledge valuable discussions with d. frantzeskakis and p. g. kevrekidis .",
