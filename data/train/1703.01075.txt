    "the formation mechanism of super star clusters ( sscs ) is a subject of keen astronomical interest , because their extremely energetic interactions with surrounding material , in the form of uv radiation , stellar winds , and supernova explosions , are influential in driving galaxy evolution . in the milky way",
    ", we have thirteen sscs as listed in a review article , while the number of sscs may increase by a more careful search for clusters in future . the young massive cluster r136 , which is responsible for ionizing the largest hii region in the local group ( 30  dor ) , is estimated to have a mass of 10@xmath3 , ten - times larger than sscs in the milky way .",
    "remarkably , r136 hosts the most massive stars over 200 @xmath4 amongst all the sscs known to date @xcite .",
    "the surroundings of r136 are also exceptionally active star forming regions involving @xmath0400 o / wr stars associated with rich neutral hydrogen gas .",
    "the gas consists of the hi ridge , the molecular ridge and the co arc , and its distribution is highly asymmetric in the lmc .",
    "it has been discussed that the two galaxies the lmc and smc are interacting with each other in the past and the interaction is influencing the star formation history .",
    "@xcite presented a scenario in which the lmc and smc had a close encounter  0.2@xmath510@xmath6 yrs ago , which perturbed the hi gas in the both galaxies and caused the current highly asymmetric hi / co gas distribution in the lmc disk .",
    "these authors suggested that the perturbed gas collided with the lmc disk at 50100 km s@xmath7 and triggered formation of r136 and the hi ridge with the highly asymmetric gas distribution .",
    "this scenario is supported by the numerical simulations of the galaxy interaction ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and is consistent with that the hi consists of two velocity features , the l- and d - components (; see a typical spectrum in figure 1a ) , whereas a detailed observational test of the scenario was not undertaken to date .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to analyse the high - angular resolution atca + parkes hi and magma co data in order to provide observational evidence for collision between the l- and d - components and to test a scenario of formation of r136 based on cloud - cloud collision ( ccc ) models ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "the atca + parkes hi 21 cm data @xcite are used in this study .",
    "the resolution of the combined hi image is 1@xmath80 .",
    "this is 15 times higher resolution than that of , which showed that the hi distribution consists of the l- and d - components .",
    "the rms noise fluctuations of the combined map , determined from the line - free parts of the final data cube , is 15 mjy beam@xmath7 .",
    "this corresponds to a brightness temperature sensitivity of 2.4 k ( 1@xmath9 ) , for velocity resolution of 1.649 km s@xmath7 .",
    "we used the data of the rotatinal transition of @xmath10co(@xmath11 = 10 ) observed with nanten 4 m telescope ( @xcite ; ; @xcite ; for a review of molecular clouds in the lmc and smc see ) for a large scale analysis .",
    "the half - power beamwidth is 2@xmath86 , and the velocity resolution is 0.65 km s@xmath7 .",
    "we also used the magma @xmath10co(@xmath11=10 ) data @xcite for a detailed analysis .",
    "the spatial resolution is @xmath12 , and the velocity resolution is 0.53 km s@xmath7 . the archival data set of dust optical depth at 353 ghz , @xmath13 , and dust temperature , @xmath14 obtained by the @xmath15 and @xmath16 data ( see for detail ) are used to make comparisons with the hi data .",
    "we also used the data from the southern h  alpha sky survey atlas ( shassa ) at 656.3 nm wavelength , the h@xmath17 emission line of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the angular resolution is about 0@xmath88 , and the sensitivity level is 2 r ( 1.2@xmath18 erg @xmath19 s@xmath7 arcsec@xmath20 ) pixel@xmath7 .",
    "we masked the data in order to eliminate regions with locally heated components and those with different environment as indicated by their high density , by using the h@xmath17 and co data when we compare @xmath21 and hi ; the areas showing co emission higher than 1 k km s@xmath7 ( 1@xmath9 ) and",
    "the areas showing h@xmath17 emission higher than 30 rayleigh are masked @xcite .",
    "following the method of we subtracted the galactic rotation in figure 1 , and reproduced their results with 1@xmath80 resolution .",
    "figure 1 shows the new images of the two hi components along with the co clouds .",
    "the main feature of the l - component is located toward the co arc and in the east of the molecular ridge , while the d - component is extended over the galactic disk .",
    "we confirmed that the asymmetric distribution of hi in figure 1a is caused by adding the l - component .",
    "figure 2 shows two dec .- velocity diagrams along the co arc and the molecular ridge . in figure 2",
    "we find the two velocity components and the bridge features between them .",
    "the intensity of the bridge features at each dec .",
    "is correlated with the co clouds and with the enhanced hi intensity , suggesting collisional interaction in ccc indicated by numerical simulations ( @xcite ; ) .     for each panel .",
    "the integration ranges in the r.a .",
    "are from 86@xmath2269 to @xmath23 in ( a ) , and @xmath24 to @xmath25 in ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the blue and red dashed perpendicular lines indicate the velocity range of l- and d - components , respectively .",
    "the black arrows in ( b ) indicate the position of bridge features .",
    "the green dashed perpendicular lines indicates intermediate velocity range of l- and d - components . ]",
    "figure 3 shows an overlay of the l- and d - components in the region including 30 dor .",
    "we see the two components show complementary distribution ; in figure 3a the d - component shows intensity depression toward the dense part of the l - component , and the l - component shows depression toward the dense part of the d - component .",
    "there are two places of the complementary distribution in the hi ridge ; one is toward ( r.a . ,",
    "dec.)@xmath0(@xmath26@xmath27 , @xmath28@xmath29 ) and the other ( r.a . ,",
    "dec.)@xmath0(@xmath30@xmath31 , @xmath32@xmath33 ) .",
    "we find the complementary distribution between the l- and d - components shows some displacement .",
    "this displacement between the two complementary features suggests that the relative motion makes a large angle to the line - of - sight @xcite .",
    "we applied the the overlapping function @xmath34(@xmath35 ) in pc@xmath36 to calculate the displacement in the complementary distribution which is presented in the appendix of @xcite in such a way that the two features coincide spatially after the displacement .",
    "specifically , we derived the projected displacement where the overlapping area of the strong l - component ( intensity larger than 1000 k km s@xmath7 ) and the depression of the d - component ( intensity smaller than 550 k km s@xmath7 ) becomes maximum . in figure",
    "3b we see two hi clouds in the l - component , the north cloud at ( r.a .",
    ", dec.)@xmath0(@xmath30@xmath37,@xmath38 @xmath39 ) and the south cloud at ( @xmath40@xmath41,@xmath42 @xmath43 ) , which are surrounded by the d - component .",
    "they exhibit a complementary distribution with displacements of 170 pc and 260 pc lengths as shown by the arrows , respectively .",
    "we confirmed that the position angle 320 deg .",
    "gives the best fit by changing the angle from 315 to 325 deg .",
    "figure 3c shows a closeup view in the r136 region , showing complementary distributions between the two velocities of hi at @xmath0100pc scale ; the two blue - shifted hi intensity depressions at ( r.a . , dec . )",
    "= ( @xmath40@xmath44,@xmath38 @xmath45 ) and ( @xmath30@xmath40,@xmath46 @xmath47 ) are clearly associated with the hi components toward the same position , where the hi distribution within 200 pc of r136 is not reliable due to artificial effects of the interferometeric fringes .",
    "figure 4 shows a scatter plot between @xmath48(hi ) and @xmath21 , where the galactic foreground component is subtracted by using the @xmath48(hi)@xmath21 relation @xcite .",
    "the plots for the d - component and the hi ridge show significantly different slopes by a factor of 2 .",
    "the difference in the slope corresponds to the difference in metalicity , if we assume that the dust - to - metal ratio is constant in the lmc .",
    "and @xmath48(hi ) for @xmath49 @xmath50 22.5 k. red points are the data of arc and molecular ridge ( the region of figure3(a ) ) , and grey points are the data of the optical stellar bar region .",
    "the red and black linear lines obtained by the least - squares fit which is assumed to have zero intercept .",
    "the data of the direction of the optical stellar bar are used for fitting of the black line , and the red data are used for fitting of the red line.,width=272 ]",
    "the present results indicate that the l- and d - components show observational signatures of cloud - cloud collision , i.e. , the two velocity components , the bridge features between them and the complementary distributions . @xcite",
    "summarize and discuss these properties based on observations of ten cases of o star formation , eight in the milky way and two in the lmc , and hydrodynamical numerical simulations of cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "the differences between the ten previous cases and the present one in the lmc are that the velocity separation 50 km s@xmath7 and the size of the colliding components 2 kpc are significantly larger than in the previous cases , and that the o and wr stars including r136 are considerably more numerous than the previous cases ( @xmath0400 in total over an area of 200 pc @xmath5 200 pc ) .",
    "we see two outstanding stellar condensations in r136 and ngc  2060 ( figure 3c ) .",
    "the major overlapping of the two components is the hi ridge in the southeast ( figure 1 ) as traced by elevated hi intensity above a contour level 2000 k km s@xmath7 . by the optically thin approximation the @xmath51(hi ) in the ridge is estimated to be ( 0.4@xmath52 @xmath19 on a 20 pc scale .",
    "the hi ridge includes two major elongated co clouds , the molecular ridge and the co arc .",
    "the total mass of the hi ridge is estimated to be 1@xmath53 and the molecular masses of the molecular ridge and the co arc are 1@xmath54and 0.5@xmath55 , respectively @xcite . a scenario in which the two velocity hi components were created by the tidal interaction between the lmc and smc 2@xmath510@xmath56 yrs ago was presented by @xcite .",
    "subsequently , numerical simulations of the galactic interaction and the gas motion were carried out by @xcite and ( ) .",
    "the present analysis shows that the stripped hi gas is at present falling onto the lmc disk at a projected velocity of 50 km s@xmath7 , as is consisted with the numerical simulations by @xcite .",
    "this interpretation indicates that l - component was on the far side of the lmc disk and is now nearly at the same location with d - component , as suggested by the ongoing collisional interaction .",
    "a possible scenario for the collisional interaction is framed as follows ,    1 .",
    "has a high @xmath51(hi ) of @xmath010@xmath57 @xmath19 .",
    "the other regions of o / wr star formation or o / wr stars are mostly distributed only on the western side of r136 , where the parent gas is already strongly dispersed by the stellar ionization .",
    "they include the region of the super shell 30 dor c , the progenitor of sn1987a , etc .",
    ", which is exposed to us , where we see some co and hi gas on small scales . the co gas in the r136 region is strongly dispersed as shown by the recent alma results @xcite whereas it is still associated with massive clumpy hi gas ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the age of r136 is estimated to be 1.5 myrs @xcite and the other o / wr stars are probably older than r136 with ages of more than a few myrs as suggested by the relative paucity of ism compared with the r136 region .",
    "the vicinity of r136 shows an ionized hi cavity of a 15 pc radius ( figure 3c).the formation of the o / wr stars took place some myrs ago and r136 was most recently formed . by considering the accumulated empirical knowledge @xcite",
    ", we suggest that the distribution of these high mass stars reflects the initial density distribution of the hi gas prior to the collision ; very dense compact gas formed r136 by collision and less dense gas formed extended o / wr stars .",
    "the masses of the two hi clumps having 100 pc size in figure 2 are estimated to be  @xmath58 @xmath59 .",
    "this is consistent with the mass of r136 @xmath60 @xmath59 which requires a parent cloud of @xmath58 @xmath4 for an assumed star formation efficiency .",
    "2 .   shows two velocity components separated by 50 km s@xmath7 , which show clear bridge features as well as complementary distributions typical to collision ( figure 2a ) .",
    "these features indicate that the collision initiated 2 myrs ago as roughly estimated from a ratio of the cloud size and the velocity 100 pc/50 km s@xmath7 .",
    "the l - component shows a little sign of deceleration , probably because @xmath51(hi ) of the l - component dominates that of the d - component toward the regions ; @xmath51(hi ) of the l - component is @xmath04@xmath61 @xmath19 while that of the d - component is @xmath62 @xmath19 .",
    "this difference results in little deceleration of the l - component by momentum conservation .",
    "the bridge features support the collisional interaction as shown by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the low average column density in the d - component did not accommodate formation of massive dense clumps in which o  stars can form .",
    "3 .   shows a single velocity broad feature in figure 2b with the co clouds . their peak velocity lies between l- and d - components after subtraction of the galactic rotation .",
    "we suggest that @xmath51(hi ) of the two components was nearly the same and high , and that the collision resulted in merging of the two components at the intermediate velocity of the two colliding components by momentum conservation .",
    "then , total @xmath51(hi ) of the merged component was elevated to @xmath01@xmath63 @xmath19 .",
    "the molecular ridge was formed by the strong compression in the collision , while some of the co gas was formed prior to the collision . in n159 e and",
    "w we found collision between filamentary clouds with a velocity of 78 km s@xmath7 by alma observations at @xmath64resolution @xcite .",
    "it is speculated that the highly filamentary distribution in n159 reflects the gas dynamics in the merging interface layer where filaments are formed according to numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the collision of hi gas flow is able to compress the hi gas and significantly increases the density according to mhd numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "h@xmath65 clouds are formed in the interface layer in @xmath0myr for density of 10@xmath66 @xmath67 , and it is expected that the molecular clouds become self - gravitating if they become massive enough .",
    "the subsequent process is calculated by @xcite which simulates the colliding flow of dense molecular gas by incorporating self - gravity .",
    "these simulations indicate formation of dense clumps which can directly lead to high - mass star formation on smaller scales of 1020 pc . in a kpc scale collision in the lmc",
    "we infer that part of the dense hi gas may be converted into gmcs if hi gas are decelerated by the collision and further compressed .",
    "@xcite presented a scenario of formation of gmcs in the lmc via gravitational hi accretion by showing the hi becomes denser toward gmcs based on the hi data @xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows a scatter plot between the dust optical depth at 353 ghz @xmath21 and the 21 cm hi intensity @xmath48(hi ) in the lmc , where only the highest dust temperature components , most probably optically thin hi emission are shown ( @xcite ; ) .",
    "the overall distribution of the plot is well represented by linear regressions in figure 4 .",
    "the points in the hi ridge are shown by red color and show a slope by a factor of 2 steeper than the rest of the points outside the hi ridge .",
    "we interpret that this difference is due to different dust abundance between them ; the hi ridge has significantly less dust grains than the rest of the lmc .",
    "the numerical simulations by @xcite shows that the hi gas of the smc is possibly mixed with the lmc gas in the tidal interaction .",
    "if this happens , the hi ridge contains a significant amount of low - metalicity hi of the smc .",
    "the metalicity of the smc is smaller than that of the lmc by a factor of five .",
    "if the hi ridge consists of hi mass both from the smc and lmc at a ratio of  1:1 , for sub - solar metalicity 1/10 in the smc and the 1/2 in the lmc , a factor of 2 different slopes in figure 4 is explained , lending a support for the tidal origin of the hi ridge .",
    "we found signatures of a collision over a few kpc between the two velocity hi components toward r136 , the hi ridge including the molecular ridge & the co arc in the lmc .",
    "the blue - shifted hi l - component was created in the galaxy interaction 0.2 gyrs ago via tidal stripping between the lmc and the smc . in 0.2 gyrs",
    ", the perturbed hi gas is now colliding interacting with the hi gas in the lmc disk .",
