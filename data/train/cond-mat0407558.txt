    "the half - metallic properties of la@xmath1sr@xmath2mno@xmath3 ( x@xmath40.3 ) ( lsmo ) are of great importance for applications in spintronics .",
    "the tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) of lsmo / srtio@xmath5(sto)/lsmo junction shows a magnetoresistance ratio in excess of 1800% @xcite and was , by these authors , attributed to half - metallicity . while the magnetic impurities which might diffuse to the insulating layer could play an important role in the tunnelling process @xcite through the spin flip effect @xcite , antiferromagnons at the interface @xcite due to an antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling with the subsurface ( or bulk ) are found also to affect the mr in manganites tunnel junctions .",
    "the magnetic properties of these materials are highly sensitive to local crystal properties .",
    "the extrinsic strain field induced by lattice mismatch with the substrates or tunnel barriers can be sufficient to severely degrade the ferromagnetic order in the surface layers which are critical for tunneling @xcite .",
    "although other defects such as segregation of a particular species , like sr in lsmo , at the interface alters the desired electronic and magnetic properties we have not addressed the issue in this work .",
    "good tmr is expected if the material is fully polarised and half - metallic .",
    "thus the occurrence of an antiferromagnetic layer or a localised layer at the surface will be very detrimental to tunneling .",
    "there is then a strong case for demanding to have both half - metallicity and ferromagnetic exchange at the interfaces between manganites and insulating barriers .",
    "understanding the spin polarisation at the surface is then of major importance assuming that growing techniques could fabricate sharp well - defined interfaces @xcite and low diffusion rates of the magnetic ions into the insulating layer . in this paper",
    "we investigate the conditions required for surface antiferromagnetism and/or localised surface states so as to make clear the physical conditions for avoiding them .    on the basis of local spin density ( lsd )",
    "band theory calculations , the origin of half - metallic character of manganese perovskites was discussed in several papers .",
    "@xcite these lsd calculations failed to obtain a half - metallic state and subsequently the possibility of transport half - metallicity was raised by nadgorny_et al._@xcite and mazin.@xcite it could equally well be argued that the fascinating electronic and magnetic properties of lsmo , including colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) , might indicate that the electronic structure is more complex than the standard band theory picture ( see reviews @xcite ) and might necessitate a better treatment of correlation effects",
    ". of particular importance would be to see if these correlation effects confirmed the half - metallicity of these materials .",
    "recently two of us  @xcite described how upon sr doping of lamno@xmath5 ( lmo ) the mn valence increases from @xmath6 to @xmath7 by delocalizing the e@xmath8 electron .",
    "these results therefore suggested that , in lsmo , sr hole doping favours band formation instead of localisation . with this sr doping no half - metallic state",
    "was obtained in lsmo .",
    "rather , the calculations suggested , half - metallicity is the consequence of remaining local jahn - teller distortions from the lmo parent material .",
    "this did go hand in hand with a mixed valence mn@xmath9/mn@xmath10 ground state which was discovered for sr concentrations less than 20%.@xcite    the importance of the local distortions in lsmo does suggest that the surface properties of lsmo might be different from the bulk properties .",
    "this could possibly have important consequences for the magnetoelectronic transport through an lsmo / sto interface .",
    "surfaces of manganese perovskites were studied before : fillipetti and pickett used a pseudopotential method to study the magnetic properties of the surface of camno@xmath5 ( cmo ) @xcite and la@xmath1ca@xmath11mno@xmath5 ( lcmo ) @xcite in the ( 001 ) direction , evarestov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used the hartree - fock approach to study the surface ( 110 ) in lamno@xmath5 .",
    "in particular the work of fillipetti and pickett  @xcite stressed the importance of spin flip processes at the surface for the transport properties .",
    "in this paper we deal with finite slabs of r@xmath1a@xmath2mno@xmath3 ( where r and a are trivalent and divalent ions respectively ) to study the surface in a tight - binding model and self - interaction corrected @xcite ( sic ) lsda calculations .",
    "the first allows us to study larger systems and more complicated magnetic configuration using a few parameters whereas the latter is parameter free and therefore more accurate but limited by the number of atoms that can be simulated .",
    "the active orbitals in a model calculation on manganites are the two degenerate @xmath0 orbitals separated by a `` strong '' ligand field from the three low - lying @xmath12 states . as we are concerned with a region of the phase diagram where most manganites are found to be in the fm metallic phase we use the kondo - lattice type model hamiltonian @xcite using the two @xmath0 orbitals :    @xmath13    the hamiltonian consists of the kinetic energy of the @xmath0 electrons with anisotropic hopping integrals @xmath14 ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the two @xmath0 orbitals , @xmath17 and @xmath18 index the sites and the first neighbours respectively ) , a hund coupling which favours the alignment of their spins ( @xmath19 ) with the core - like @xmath12 moments ( @xmath20 ) and superexchange interaction between the classical @xmath12 spins .",
    "the transfer integrals between two orbitals @xmath21 ( orbital 1 ) and @xmath22 ( orbital 2 ) on adjacent mn ions are given by : @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the slater - koster parameter and @xmath26 , @xmath27 are the energies of the o @xmath28 and mn @xmath29 states .",
    "this parameter takes into account the hybridisation with o which does not appear explicitly in the model .",
    "as shown above an electron in the state @xmath21 can not hop along the @xmath30 direction whereas its hopping integral along @xmath31 and @xmath32 is larger than for the @xmath22 .",
    "this fact will be important in the determination of the occupancy of the two orbitals in the presence of the surface and/or an interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling .",
    "the strong on - site hund coupling will favour the alignment of neighbouring core spins via the itinerant @xmath0 electrons .",
    "competing with this tendency is the superexchange which acts between core spins on neighbouring sites .",
    "this interaction is responsible for the observed g - af phase in the end members amno@xmath3 where the @xmath0 electrons are absent and thus only the superexchange operates .",
    "the superexchange also wins over when there are not enough carriers to lower the total energy by a gain in kinetic energy or in case where hopping is suppressed due to other factors as is the case in the presence of a surface as we will see below . in order to keep the number of parameters to a minimum",
    "we did not include the coulomb on - site repulsion between @xmath0 electrons nor the jahn - teller coupling @xcite . on the other hand we added a shift@xcite @xmath33 of the on - site energy for the orbitals at the surface in order to take into account the change in energy of the states at the surface due chemical shifts and/or strain fields",
    ". this may be the case at interfaces with grain boundaries or with insulating barriers in tunneling devices as explained above .",
    "one of the major effects of the surface is the occurrence of a charge transfer to or from the bulk region inducing a loss of local neutrality and creation of electrostatic dipoles .",
    "we treat these interactions in the hartree approximation @xcite by solving the poisson equation with @xmath34 .",
    "the coupled schrdinger - poisson equations are solved self consistently until the relative change in energy and charge is less than 0.05% .",
    "we will consider three possible magnetic configurations namely ferromagnetic ( fm ) , a - type antiferromagnetic ( a - af ) and a configuration where all the moments on the inner layers are parallel and the surface one flipped ( duud , where d is for down and u is for up ) in order to look at the interplay between magnetic ordering and orbital ordering and the effect of the surface . in section",
    "iii.c we evaluate the energy of a reversed layer .",
    "we assume an in - plane ferromagnetic ordering so that we have one inequivalent atom per plane .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the occupancies of the @xmath22 and @xmath21 orbitals in these three configurations .",
    "there is a noticeable correlation between the type of magnetic and orbital orderings .",
    "the @xmath22 is more populated than the @xmath21 on those planes which are antiparallel to their neighbours . whereas the two are equally occupied when the coupling is fm .",
    "the surface layer is an exception however but this is not surprising having in mind the anisotropy of the transfer integrals defined above .",
    "occupancy of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 and their sum as a function of the distance from the surface for a 21-layer tb model of r@xmath35a@xmath36mno@xmath3 .",
    "the configurations are in order fm , fm with the surface layer flipped ( duud ) and a - af.,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=151 ]   occupancy of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 and their sum as a function of the distance from the surface for a 21-layer tb model of r@xmath35a@xmath36mno@xmath3 .",
    "the configurations are in order fm , fm with the surface layer flipped ( duud ) and a - af.,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=151 ]   occupancy of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 and their sum as a function of the distance from the surface for a 21-layer tb model of r@xmath35a@xmath36mno@xmath3 .",
    "the configurations are in order fm , fm with the surface layer flipped ( duud ) and a - af.,title=\"fig:\",width=264,height=151 ]    the higher occupancy of the @xmath22 orbital at the surface is explained by the absence of interlayer hopping for the electrons in this state which do not lose kinetic energy in the presence of the surface . whereas the @xmath21 electrons are more sensitive to the presence of the surface which limits their hopping and as a result this orbital is more occupied in the bulk where the levels are broadened than at the surface where the level is more localised .",
    "as mentioned above the anisotropy of the hopping integrals leads to no direct electron transfer from @xmath22 orbitals between planes .",
    "hence in the current model the local density of states ( dos ) projected on this orbital is independent both of the position in the slab and the magnetic orientation of the neighbouring planes . on the other hand",
    "there is transfer between @xmath21 orbitals along @xmath30 .",
    "this means that the local @xmath21 dos will be narrowed at the surface because the transfer is only to one plane instead of two and this is true also if there is af order .",
    "we see this effect clearly in fig .",
    "conversely , the decrease in the kinetic energy of the @xmath21 electrons at the surface results in the weakening of the double exchange and a tendency to an af coupling between the surface and subsurface layers . the higher occupancy of the @xmath22 orbital at the surface makes it more likely that it will want to localise as we will see below in the sic calculations . inside the bulk - like region of the slab",
    "the two orbitals are equally likely to be occupied as long as the coupling between layers is fm .",
    "the strong on - site hund s coupling will always act to align the @xmath0 electron s spin to the @xmath12 one and in order for the system to gain from the kinetic energy of the electrons , the core spins ought to be parallel .",
    "if this is not the case then the hopping is partially suppressed and the superexchange wins over .",
    "this suppression occurs between layers and as the only orbital which has a finite transfer integral in this direction the @xmath21 will be penalised and hence depopulated as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] where no shift of the surface levels is introduced the @xmath21 is disfavoured near the surface because of the narrowing of the local dos .",
    "the electrons would rather go to the wider @xmath22 dos .",
    "thus there is an orbital order induced at the surface and is present in all of the three configurations but is stronger when there is a local afm coupling between the surface and subsurface layers as is the case in ( b ) .",
    "the effect is even bigger in ( c ) where the af coupling all through the slab causes a narrowing of the @xmath21 and no significant change to the @xmath22 dos so that we found orbital order throughout the film .",
    "the total electron density shown by the sum , @xmath37 , is almost unchanged at 0.7 .",
    "this is due to the suppression of charge imbalance by including the electrostatic interactions solved for in the poisson equation . without this extra electrostatic term",
    "the electrons in the absence of a shift of the surface levels would transfer to the inner part of the slab raising the density above the bulk level independently of the slab thickness .",
    "we see however from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that we get the bulk properties for three layers away from the surface .",
    "we have studied the effect of introducing the shift @xmath33 for both orbitals and for only one of them at the surface .",
    "as explained earlier , this parameter is used to mimic the effect of structural ( like lattice mismatch ) and chemical ( like charged surfaces ) on the on - site energy level of the orbitals .",
    "here we look at the effect on the orbital ordering and in section iii.c we will consider the changes in the relative stability of the two solutions fm and duud .",
    "the orbital occupancies are given in fig.[fig2 ] as a function of the strength @xmath33 for the two magnetic solutions corresponding to @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the fig .",
    "we found that when both orbitals are shifted by a small @xmath33 the occupation of the @xmath22 remains higher and is explained from the simple kinetic energy gains argument explained earlier .",
    "increasing @xmath33 results in a crossover to higher occupancy of the @xmath21 orbital but this is explained also from the anisotropy of the transfer integrals argument . as is depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the ldos of the @xmath22 orbital is broader than that of @xmath21 so that when the fermi level is well below the centre of the bands the occupation of the first is higher . with increasing @xmath33",
    "the fermi level lies at the centre and the two orbitals are equally filled .",
    "increasing further @xmath33 will favour the occupation of @xmath21 which has higher number of states available in a much smaller energy window .",
    "the crossover occurs for smaller values of @xmath33 in the fm solution than in the duud case , in agreement with our earlier finding that the occupation of @xmath21 favours fm coupling .",
    "shifting one orbital only will favour its occupation in both solutions and for values of @xmath33 larger than 2@xmath40 the other orbital is completely depleted .",
    "evolution of the occupancies of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 orbitals at the surface versus the shift @xmath33 .",
    "two configurations are considered : fm(a ) and duud ( b).,title=\"fig:\",width=340,height=188 ]   evolution of the occupancies of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 orbitals at the surface versus the shift @xmath33 .",

    "the mn in layers 2 and 10 have localised @xmath42 electrons and the other mn have localised @xmath43 electrons only .",
    "the left - hand - side picture shows the supercell.,width=291,height=340 ]      as mentioned above we report also on results using the sic - lsda to study the surface of a a representative system , la@xmath35sr@xmath36mno@xmath3 .",
    "this method has already been used with success in studying the bulk properties of this material @xcite .",
    "it allows for a parameter - free total energy minimisation with respect to the localised / itinerant state of the mn @xmath44 electrons in our case .",
    "the number of electrons allowed for band formation is found by comparing total energies in the two configurations where the electron is itinerant and where it is localised .",
    "the valency of the mn ions is then found by subtracting the localised electrons from the total number of valence electrons .",
    "it has been applied successfully to systems where there is strong tendency to localisation of the valence electrons that could not be accounted for using the conventional lsda functionals.@xcite    here the focus is put on the changes brought about by the surface on the charge and orbital orderings .",
    "the valence of mn in lsmo was calculated to be tetravalent @xcite in the bulk material .",
    "however we find here that this valence is reduced to trivalent when the mn is on the subsurface layer .",
    "we report on calculations in which we include a virtual la / sr atom to account for the mixed valence .",
    "all the layers are either mno@xmath45 or la@xmath35sr@xmath36o .",
    "this is a type of rigid band model .",
    "first we studied a supercell consisting of four layers of mno@xmath45 with three and four layers of la@xmath35sr@xmath36o .",
    "the second system is considered in order to check the effect of the stoichiometry which is not respected in the system with three la@xmath35sr@xmath36o layers only .",
    "this non - stoichiometric system is symmetric and the calculations are much less involved than in the stoichiometric but non - symmetric case .",
    "the slabs are separated by seven and six layers of empty spheres in the symmetric and non - symmetric case respectively .",
    "the non - symmetric system has two surface terminations , _",
    "i.e _ mno@xmath45 and la@xmath35sr@xmath36o whereas in the symmetric case the termination is mno@xmath45 .    in the lsda calculations we found an energy difference of 8.04 mry/(mno@xmath45 layer ) between the ground - state fm configuration and the configuration where the surface moment is antiparallel to the bulk ones ( duud ) in the symmetric case . for the non - symmetric case the ground state is also fm and the difference in energy with the flipped surface moment configuration is of 5.59 mry/(mno@xmath45 layer ) .",
    "the surface and subsurface mn magnetic moments in the ground state are of 3.26 and 3.16@xmath46 in the symmetric system and of 3.28 and 3.12@xmath46 in the non - symmetric system .",
    "the results are indeed in good agreement .",
    "we then studied different orbital localisation scenarios .",
    "these are the localisation of the 3@xmath12 orbitals all through the slab and localisation of an extra @xmath0 orbital at the surface , which gives three possible scenarios for each of the magnetic configurations . in both systems",
    "the ground state is the fm phase with the 3@xmath12 orbitals only localised on all the mn ions .",
    "the fm configuration with an extra @xmath22 localised at the surface is 6.67 mry/(mno@xmath45 layer ) higher in the symmetric case and is of 6.21 mry/(mno@xmath45 layer ) in the non - symmetric case .",
    "the surface and subsurface mn magnetic moments are of 3.30 and 3.31@xmath46 in the symmetric system and of 3.32 and 3.27@xmath46 in the stoichiometric system .    having confirmed that the stoichiometry has negligible effect on the overall relative stability of different orbital and magnetic configurations we applied this method to symmetric five - mno@xmath47 layers supercell of lsmo surface which included four unit cells of empty spheres ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) . in this case",
    "the mno@xmath45 layer is at the sub - surface rather than the surface which we studied previously .",
    "the tb model does not include the la@xmath35sr@xmath36o layers and therefore can not differentiate between these cases .",
    "however a phenomenological shift @xmath33 of the on - site energies at the surface could capture this .",
    "we found that terminations by the la@xmath35sr@xmath36o layer leads to the localisation of one more electron on the mn atoms in the mno@xmath47 layer under surface .",
    "the ground state configuration has localised 3@xmath48 electrons under the surface and 3@xmath12 electrons on the manganeses in the bulk in agreement with the model calculations when the shift @xmath33 is applied to the surface e@xmath49 orbital ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "since the mno@xmath45 layer is not the termination , the @xmath21 could not be said to be favoured as was the case in earlier calculations @xcite .",
    "there is however an electrostatic interaction with the surface @xmath50 ion which means that the energy level of this orbital should increase in comparison to the case when the mno@xmath47 layer is at the surface . whereas this is not true for the e@xmath49 orbital which is less sensitive to the presence of the extra la@xmath35sr@xmath36o layer",
    "the situation can then be modelled by shifting the on - site e@xmath49 level downwards which is equivalent to shifting the other level upwards .",
    "the calculated ground state configuration has the total energy of 37 mry lower than the system with all mn@xmath10 configured manganese . from the ldos of the first layer we can see small contributions of electronic states from the vacuum region .",
    "the la@xmath35sr@xmath36o surface layer becomes insulating with a band gap of about 1 ev . the ldos for the first mno@xmath47 layer with mn@xmath9 valence shows a nearly half - metallic character with a nearby pseudo - gap of 1.7 ev .",
    "this shows that localisation of the e@xmath49 electron , forced by the surface , leads to near half - metallic properties at the lsmo surface as was mentioned before @xcite .",
    "the change of the symmetry of the localised electron to @xmath21 increases the total energy by about 23 mry .",
    "this is a substantial energy , 62% of the energy needed for delocalizing this e@xmath8 electron .",
    "additionally , the rotation of @xmath21 orbitals by 90@xmath51 into the @xmath52 plane makes this configuration unfavourable by only 10 mry in comparison with the ground state configuration of a localised e@xmath49 electron .",
    "localisation of @xmath53 electrons on the other mn atoms , inside the bulk , increases the total energy of the system .",
    "the ldos for the next lao layer shows metallic character with a small number of electrons at the fermi level but each of the mno@xmath47 layers including the mn@xmath10 has a clear metallic character . the ldos for the layers below these are similar to the ones for the bulk .",
    "we noted that decreasing the volume of elementary cell increases the differences between the energies described above .",
    "however , increasing the lattice parameter by 2% decreases the differences between energies states ten times .",
    "the magnetic order at the surface changes through spin flip processes from the bulk to a local anti - ferromagnetic arrangement .      depending on the surface / interface termination several scenarios are possible which will allow for a particular orbital to be favoured .",
    "it has been argued that a termination with mno@xmath45 plane will favour the occupation of the e@xmath54 orbital @xcite which has its lobe oriented toward the missing oxygen ion and hence has lower electrostatic energy than the e@xmath49 which still sees the oxygens present in the plane .",
    "a phase diagram in the parameter space has been obtained @xcite where it is shown clearly that a large shift @xmath33 of the e@xmath54 with respect to e@xmath49 and the bulk levels will favour an inplane antiferromagnetism at the surface and a canted configuration with respect to the `` bulk '' .",
    "energy differences between the two configurations where the surface - subsurface coupling is afm or fm in units of the hopping parameter @xmath40 per surface mn ion versus the amount @xmath33 of the shift added to one or both surface levels .",
    "the hund s coupling parameter is @xmath55.,width=302,height=188 ]    first principles calculations @xcite on the other hand found that the surface - subsurface exchange coupling in la@xmath2ca@xmath1mno@xmath3 is fm independently of the `` bulk '' magnetic configuration .",
    "the authors@xcite argued that this is due to the dangling e@xmath54 bond again which favours this ferromagnetism . whereas in the present",
    "_ ab initio _ study we have found that it is rather the e@xmath49 that is localised as the mno@xmath45 layer is the sub - surface rather than the terminating layer .",
    "we present below results concerning the competition between fm and afm surface - subsurface coupling as a function of the symmetry of the localised orbital and the amount @xmath33 by which the levels are shifted .",
    "we considered shifts of both levels simultaneously and of one orbital at a time and calculated the band energies ( kinetic plus hartree ) when the surface - subsurface coupling is either fm or afm .",
    "the superexchange energy difference between them is of @xmath56 per surface mn ion .",
    "the results are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] where the energies are given in units of the hopping integral @xmath40 and the hund s coupling constant @xmath57 is taken equal to @xmath58 . as can be seen from the figure while localising both orbitals does not change the relative energies , localising the e@xmath49 will affect strongly the surface - subsurface ferromagnetism .",
    "this is due to the depletion of the other orbital on the surface and hence the weakening of the double exchange mechanism mediated by e@xmath54 electrons hopping between the layers . in the case",
    "where both orbitals are shifted it is the reduction in the subsurface occupation of the e@xmath54 orbital which limits the gain in kinetic energy that would result from the higher occupation of the surface e@xmath54 orbital .",
    "the relative stability of the two configurations remains unaltered as a result .",
    "shifting the e@xmath54 will enhance the fm coupling with the bulk as found in the _ ab initio _ study of the mno@xmath45-terminated system .",
    "but this is true only if the e@xmath49 is not strongly disfavoured as found in the previous model calculations @xcite .",
    "if the occupation of the latter orbital is low at the surface in - plane anti - parallel coupling of the spins would result as a consequence of the weakening of the double exchange at the surface which is mediated mostly by e@xmath49 electrons .",
    "we have considered what light our calculations have shed on the ideal hole - doped - manganite - insulator interface such that tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) is optimal .",
    "we have studied changes that are induced by the lack of cubic symmetry at the surface as well as different chemical environments which favour the formation of localised states , through a realistic double exchange model and first principles calculations . in the model calculation",
    "we have taken account of the different scenarios by adding a shift @xmath33 to the surface on - site energy of the orbitals .",
    "if a surface / tunnel barrier has net positive charge @xmath33 will be negative for both orbitals .",
    "if this is too large we get localisation which is bad for tunneling .",
    "equally a strong negative charged termination is also bad because a positive @xmath33 will deplete both orbitals leading to magnetic disorder at the surface .",
    "if the in - plane lattice constant of the barrier is smaller than that of the manganite crystal there will be a strain field which gives a negative @xmath59 tending to favour the e@xmath54 orbital . for small values of @xmath59 surface ferromagnetism",
    "is enhanced .",
    "however large values of this strain will deplete the e@xmath49 orbital and favour in - plane antiferromagnetism at the surface mno@xmath45 layer which is detrimental to tmr",
    ". on the other hand strains favouring e@xmath49 always suppresses ferromagnetic ordering and hence tmr . in the absence of any chemical shift of the atomic levels at the surface only a small amount of charge is transfered to the bulk because of the resulting electrostatic forces tendency to restore local charge neutrality . shifting both levels or one of them however",
    "will result in charge transfer to the surface for large values of @xmath33 .",
    "this leads to the formation of mn@xmath9 at the surface .",
    "these findings are confirmed by the more accurate _",
    "ab initio _ sic - lda calculation on a model system la@xmath35sr@xmath36mno@xmath3 . in these calculations we found no localisation of the surface orbitals when the slab is terminated by a mno@xmath45 layer and the coupling is ferromagnetic .",
    "we studied the lasro - terminated system were the subsurface e@xmath54 still sees an oxygen ion on the surface and interacts strongly with it .",
    "this orbital is then disfavoured and we found that the e@xmath49 is localised at the subsurface layer changing the valency of the mn ion from tetravalent in the bulk to trivalent at the surface .",
    "the magnetic coupling then becomes antiferromagnetic as would be expected from the correlation between orbital and magnetic ordering .",
    "however if the interlayer distance is increased at the surface , which amounts to favouring the e@xmath54 , we found that the energy differences between competing orderings decrease significantly .",
    "this relates the _ ab initio _ results to the model ones . in summary",
    "we predict that the best tmr will come from tunnel barriers that are neutral or weakly positive .",
    "there should be a minimal surface strain although a small in - plane compressive strain favouring the e@xmath54 is actually beneficial .",
