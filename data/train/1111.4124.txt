    "one of fundamental issues in nuclear physics is the equation of state ( eos ) of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , which plays a central role in understanding not only the structure of radioactive nuclei , the reaction dynamics induced by rare isotopes , and the liquid - gas phase transition in asymmetric nuclear matter , but also many critical issues in astrophysics @xcite . for symmetric nuclear matter with equal fractions of neutrons and protons , its eos is relatively well - determined from analyses of the giant monopole resonances of finite nuclei @xcite as well as collective flows @xcite and subthreshold kaon production @xcite in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions . on the other hand , the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter , especially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath11 , is poorly known . during the last decade",
    ", significant progress has been made both experimentally and theoretically on constraining the behavior of the symmetry energy around and below normal nuclear matter density  @xcite ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for review of recent progress ) while its super - normal density behavior remains elusive and largely controversial  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , all many - body theory calculations to date have demonstrated that the nuclear symmetry energy essentially characterizes the isospin dependent part of the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter and the higher - order terms in isospin asymmetry are unimportant , at least for densities up to moderate values li08 , leading to the well - known empirical parabolic law .",
    "when the empirical parabolic law itself provides a good approximation to the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter and thus allows one to extract the symmetry energy from the energy difference between pure neutron matter and symmetric nuclear matter , it may cause large errors when it is applied to determine some physical quantities under special conditions .",
    "for example , the higher - order terms in isospin asymmetry presented in the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter at supra - normal densities can significantly modify the proton fraction in @xmath12-equilibrium neutron - star matter and the critical density for the direct urca process which can lead to faster cooling of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent studies @xcite indicate that the higher - order terms in isospin asymmetry are very important for determining the transition density and pressure at the inner edge separating the liquid core from the solid crust of neutron stars where the matter is extremely neutron - rich .",
    "furthermore , the higher - order effects on the incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter have also been studied recently @xcite .",
    "these studies about the higher - order effects are essentially performed within the nonrelativistic models since the analytical expressions of the higher - order terms in isospin asymmetry , e.g. , the nuclear matter fourth - order symmetry energy @xmath0 , can be relatively easily obtained in such nonrelativistic models .",
    "it is thus interesting to see if the same conclusion can be obtained within the relativistic models .",
    "one of very popular relativistic models is the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model which is generally based on effective interaction lagrangians involving nucleon and meson fields @xcite . as a phenomenological approach ,",
    "the rmf model has achieved great success during the last decades in describing many nuclear phenomena @xcite .",
    "although the full expressions have been usually used in realistic rmf model calculations , nevertheless , it will be instructive to see separately the effects of the higher - order terms in isospin asymmetry , e.g. , the nuclear matter fourth - order symmetry energy @xmath0 , within the rmf model .",
    "the main motivation of the present work is to derive the nuclear matter fourth - order symmetry energy @xmath0 within the nonlinear rmf model and then explore the higher - order @xmath0 corrections to the widely used empirical parabolic law for the isospin asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "based on two accurately calibrated interactions , our results indicate that the @xmath0 may have significant influence on the properties of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , the proton fraction @xmath8 in @xmath12-stable neutron star matter and the core - crust transition density @xmath9 and pressure @xmath10 in neutron stars , confirming the previous nonrelativistic calculations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    ", we briefly discuss the bulk characteristic parameters of asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the model used in the present paper and the analytical expression of the @xmath13th - order symmetry energy will also given in this section .",
    "the results and discussions are then presented in section [ s3 ] .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section [ s4 ] .",
