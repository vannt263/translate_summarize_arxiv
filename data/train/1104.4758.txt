    "<S> assuming that the universe is filled by one single fluid , we present in the context of general relativity a possible explanation for the acceleration of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we use ordinary thermodynamics and the fact that small matter perturbations barely propagate in our universe , to derive a general solution for a single fluid in which the speed of sound vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> we find a model that contains @xmath0cdm as a special case , and is compatible with current observational data .    </S>",
    "<S> to explain the ( positive ) acceleration of the universe @xcite , it is usually assumed that , besides a dust - like fluid , the universe is filled by an additional exotic fluid that accounts for about 75% of the energy density in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> many models are known in the literature that intend to describe the nature of this additional component @xcite ; the simplest explanation is obtained by assuming the existence of a cosmological constant which is the basic ingredient of the well - known @xmath0cdm model . despite its simplicity , the @xmath0cdm model suffers from various theoretical shortcomings @xcite , so it appears inadequate to be considered as a definitive model . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a different approach based on the assumption that the dynamics of the universe satisfies the laws of ordinary thermodynamics and on the observational fact that the speed of sound vanishes for a matter fluid @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a perfectly homogeneous and isotropic cosmology with zero spatial curvature is described by the friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) line element ds^2=dt^2-a(t)^2(dr^2+r^2 ^ 2d^2 )  . </S>",
    "<S> [ frw ] moreover , the gravitational source is assumed to be described by the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid @xcite : @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> one can show that for a cosmological model satisfying the above symmetry conditions it is possible to apply the laws of ordinary thermodynamics in a consistent manner @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a reversible and frictionless universe , satisfying the first law of thermodynamics , @xmath2 , and the equation of state ( eos ) of an ideal gas @xmath3 , where the heat capacities are defined as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the enthalpy of the system . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we assume that the evolution of the universe is adiabatic and reversible so that a polytropic relation holds , @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that currently the perturbations of the density , @xmath9 , barely propagate in the universe @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it then follows that the speed of sound @xmath10 can be considered as vanishing . on the other hand , from the above thermodynamic assumptions we obtain for the universe @xmath11 so that for a vanishing sound speed the allowed solutions are formally @xmath12 or @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> the first solution implies a pressureless universe whereas the second solution leads to a heat capacity @xmath14 , equivalent to @xmath15 , and a pressure @xmath16 which is negative for positive values of the heat capacity @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the important result of assuming an ideal - gas - like universe with zero speed of sound is that the pressure in that universe can be zero or negative . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , let us notice that this is a consequence of the fact that each particle of a given fluid undergoes an early isentropic process , when the wave amplitude is infinitesimal . </S>",
    "<S> this condition follows from the fact that , in general , the entropy is proportional to the square of the velocity and temperature gradients . we will now consider a vanishing speed of sound in the context of a frw cosmology . without putting any further information into the einstein equations , we expect as a result a cosmological model in which the total pressure is negative and constant . </S>",
    "<S> considering for the sake of simplicity the redshift @xmath18 as the  time \" variable defined by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the time coordinate , the conservation law for a generic fluid with eos @xmath21 , is [ cons ] -=0 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming @xmath22 , we get + = 0 , whose solutions are @xmath23 notice that as a consequence of the thermodynamic hypothesis presented above , we obtain in a straightforward manner a dust - like term and an additional term with a time  </S>",
    "<S> dependent barotropic factor . </S>",
    "<S> this is a result of our model which is otherwise usually postulated arbitrarily in cosmology @xcite .    introducing the above solutions for @xmath24 into eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath25 ) , we obtain the most general density for _ one fluid _ satisfying the condition @xmath26 ( z)= ( _ m+)(1+z)^3 - . [ rho ] notice that the term @xmath27 corresponds to the solution @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this general solution involves three constant parameters , namely , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    introducing @xmath32 into the first friedmann equation @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the generic normalized hubble rate , @xmath34 , @xmath35 where we adopt the convention @xmath36 , with the critical density defined as @xmath37 . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath38 ) , we used the condition @xmath39 , which gives @xmath40 where @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to determine the hubble rate @xmath42 we need the constant @xmath43 , whereas to determine the barotropic factor @xmath44 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bz ] ) it is necessary to know the two constants @xmath45 and @xmath43 .    using the relationship as @xmath46 which follows from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath47 ) , it is possible to rewrite eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hz ] ) as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and the cosmological constant term reads @xmath50 .    the @xmath0cdm model is contained in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rho ] ) in the limiting case @xmath51 with @xmath52 so that @xmath30 turns out to represent the sum of the baryonic and the cold dark matter densities . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the model presented here is a generalization of @xmath0cdm and it is the result of the physical assumption that the universe is made of only one matter fluid in which the the speed of sound is required to vanish . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the crucial difference lies in the fact that in the present model no cosmological constant is postulated _ a priori_.    in addition , difficulties related to the well - known problems of coincidence and of fine tuning @xcite are solved in the context of the present model by the presence of a variable barotropic factor @xmath44 and by the fact that no cosmological constant is assumed to be related to the vacuum energy .    for instance , </S>",
    "<S> if we consider @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xcite , we get from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath55 ) and </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath47 ) @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which represents a value of @xmath43 , compatible with an expanding universe .    moreover , it is possible to infer the limits of the evolution of @xmath44 as @xmath58 eqs . </S>",

    "<S> the indicative values are @xmath53 , @xmath69.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    using eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath38 ) and ( @xmath74 ) , it is possible to perform an experimental procedure to constrain the values of the constants @xmath45 , @xmath43 and @xmath29 . in particular , we employ the three most common fitting procedures : supernovae ia ( sneia ) , baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will use of the most recent updated union 2 compilation @xcite , which alleviates the problem of systematics .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , associating to each supernova modulus @xmath75 the corresponding @xmath76 error , denoted by @xmath77 , we define the distance modulus @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the luminosity distance @xmath80 and we minimize the chi square , defined as follows @xmath81    the second test that we perform is related to the observations of large scale galaxy clusterings , which provide the signatures of the bao @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use the measurement of the peak of luminous red galaxies observed in sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , denoted by @xmath82 @xmath83^{\\frac{1}{3 } } \\left [ \\frac{1}{z_{bao}}\\int_0^{z_{bao } } \\frac{h_0}{h(z)}dz\\right]^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the observed @xmath82 is estimated to be @xmath85 with an error @xmath86 . in the case of the bao measurement </S>",
    "<S> we minimize the chi square @xmath87    finally , for the cmb test we define the so - called cmb shift parameter @xmath88 with @xmath89 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it gives a complementary bound to the sneia data and bao because the sneia redshift is @xmath90 , @xmath84 , while here @xmath91 .    </S>",
    "<S> we minimize the chi square @xmath92    it is important to note that bao and cmb do not depend on the values of @xmath93 . </S>",

    "<S> note that the value of @xmath93 for the sneia tests is @xmath103 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the values of @xmath45 , @xmath43 and @xmath29 of tab . </S>",
    "<S> i are in agreement with the theoretical results showed previously .    during the last decades , </S>",
    "<S> different parametrizations of @xmath44 were proposed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , @xmath104 , @xmath105 or @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the third case was introduced by chevallier , polarski and linder and it is referred to as the cpl parametrization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cpl parametrization has the advantages that at low and very high redshift it reduces to constant values , respectively @xmath107 , and @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> however , all the parametrizations suggested so far for @xmath44 are either _ ad hoc _ proposals or the result of phenomenological assumptions only . our model predicts a theoretical barotropic factor @xmath44 , and it is also able to reproduce previous results ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the barotropic factor is also connected to an interesting quantity , that one might consider as a natural measure of time variation , namely , @xmath109 . in models involving a scalar field @xmath110 with potential @xmath111 </S>",
    "<S> , this quantity is related to the slow - roll potential @xmath112 , in the region @xmath113 , where the scalar field is most likely to be evolving as the epoch of matter domination changes over to dark energy domination . for the cpl parametrization @xmath114 , while for the present model it is @xmath115 by comparing our result with cpl we have two solutions . </S>",
    "<S> one of these solutions is physically compatible with the accelerating scenario ; in fact , by considering @xmath116 and the indicative value @xmath117 @xcite , we find @xmath118 , in agreement with the observational results .    </S>",
    "<S> we present below the graphics of the evolution of @xmath44 , @xmath119 and the expansion history for @xmath120 , given by @xcite @xmath121     ( y axis ) for our model ( dashed line ) and cpl ( black line ) . </S>",

    "<S> unfortunately , all the attempts to describe this unexpected acceleration , suffer from various shortcomings . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the @xmath0cdm remains the favorite fitting model to describe the universe dynamics , by including in einstein equations a second fluid characterized by the cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that it is possible to discard the existence of a second fluid and , instead , to use ordinary thermodynamics . assuming a vanishing speed of sound in order to guarantee that small matter perturbations </S>",
    "<S> do not propagate , we obtain a theoretical parametrization for @xmath24 , which generalizes the @xmath0cdm model , reducing to it in a special case . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the model presented here solves the coincidence and fine tuning problems in a straightforward manner . using the cosmological tests of sneia , bao and cmb </S>",
