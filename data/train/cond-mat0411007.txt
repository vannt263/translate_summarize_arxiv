    "for the sake of completeness and comparison we rederive the already known results for a pure normal metal structure and that of a normal metal double barrier structure in junction with an isotropic @xmath1 superconductor .     from the discussion above the pumped current in case of a normal metal double barrier structure at resonance reduces to ( from eq.10)- @xmath55     for a normal @xmath1 superconductor which is isotropic @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "depending on the relative magnitudes of @xmath88 and @xmath89 and the injection angle @xmath64 the ratio @xmath90 can be as low as zero as in the pure @xmath2 case or as large as @xmath91 as in the pure @xmath1 case .",

    "11 , we have @xmath98 and thus the pumped current into the normal metal lead for this order parameter becomes , @xmath99    furthermore , the ratio of the pumped current in presence of the high - t@xmath0 superconductor with pairing symmetry of the type @xmath36 to that in a pure normal metal double barrier structure ( see eq .",
    "13 ) is    @xmath100    from the above expression it is evident that the maximum enhancement of the pumped current is @xmath101 times of that in a pure normal metal structure .",

    "while as seen before for the @xmath1 case there is four fold enhancement as compared to the normal metal case , in case of a @xmath3 superconductor there is no pumped current at all , and for the case of @xmath104 and @xmath105 superconductor the enhancement depends on the relative magnitude of the components as well as the injection angle . to probe the dependence of the injection angle and relative magnitudes of the different components in the cases where we have considered mixed pairing symmetry , we in figure 2 plot the the ratio of the pumped current in presence of the high - t@xmath9 superconductor as function of the injection angle for different ratios of the relative magnitudes where mixed pairing symmetry is considered alongwith the pure @xmath1 and @xmath3 cases .",
    "= 7.5 in    from the figure 2 , it is quite evident that the @xmath1 and @xmath106 cases are completely independent of injection angle .",
    "furthermore , one can clearly see that whatever the strength of the subdominant component in the mixture i.e. , @xmath107 or @xmath94 for the injection angle @xmath108 , one has for the pumped current in @xmath104 and @xmath105 cases four times that in the pure normal metal structure .",
    "also it is evident especially for the relative magnitudes of the sub - dominant component in the mixture being around half or more , that there is a marked difference between the @xmath104 and @xmath105 cases at injection angles @xmath109 , while for the @xmath104 case the pumped current is almost same as that in a normal metal structure in figure 2(b ) , in figure 2(c ) it is almost twice of that in a normal metal structure , but in both figures 2(b ) , and figure 2(c ) the pumped current in the @xmath105 case is zero at the same injection angle values .",
    "these differences can be easily exploited in distinguishing the different pairing symmetries considered here .",
    "a time dependent scatterer always generates heat flows and can be considered as a mesoscopic ( phase coherent ) heat source which can be useful for studying various thermoelectric phenomena in mesoscopic structures .",
    "the adiabatic quantum pump thus not only generates an electric current but also heat current which can be expressed as the sum of noise power and the joule heat dissipated@xcite . in this section",
    "we look into the heat pumped and the noise generated for the various order parameters of the high - t@xmath0 superconductors considered above to further unravel the differences among them .",
    "the expressions for pumped heat and noise in the presence of a superconducting ( @xmath1 ) lead have been earlier derived earlier in ref .",
    "[ ] . below we extend the description to include the @xmath3 , @xmath53 and @xmath105 superconductors .",

    "of - course , @xmath141 implies that in this case there is no charge current as well .    : in this case as also seen earlier , we have @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "thus there is no heat pumped neither any noise generated nor any joule heat dissipated .",
    "thus the pump in conjunct with a @xmath2-wave superconductor is cent - percent optimal for any configuration of the parameters and under any condition .",

    "to end this section we have seen that the pumped heat and noise generated in the pumping process can also show marked differences for the various order parameters considered . in the @xmath1 , the @xmath104 and the @xmath54 cases the system is non - optimal",
    "while in the @xmath6 case it is cent percent optimal .",
    "further more in the @xmath54 case the pump may be turned optimal in some special situations as seen in figure 3 .",
    "these situations would help in differentiating between the order parameters for the mixed parameter cases . especially for figures 3(b ) and 3(c ) as it is quite clear that the pump is optimal ( or , noiseless ) in case of the @xmath54 superconductor at injection angles @xmath152 .",
    "although theoretical examples in quantum pumping phenomena are quite abundant , experiments in this field are very much lacking . till date there have been notably four experiments in refs.[]and a quantum spin pump in ref.[(b ) ] . the last reference deal with a quantum dot which with application of an inplane magnetic field can pump a pure spin current .",
    "one can suitably modify these experiments and place the quantum dot in junction with a high - t@xmath9 superconductor .",

    "after this the two delta barrier s can be two gates which control the charge on the dot , modulating these two gates in time will enable a pumped charge ( also heat and noise ) current to flow .",
