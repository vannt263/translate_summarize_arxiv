    "the abo@xmath4 perovskite surfaces are important for many technological applications , _ e.g. _ sto is widely used as a substrate for epitaxial growth of high-_t@xmath5 _ superconducting thin films , bto and pto and their solid solutions are promising for non - volatile memory cells , as electro - optical materials , and for piezoelectrical devices @xcite . due to intensive development and progressive miniaturization of electronic devices , the electronic properties and atomic structure of the abo@xmath0 perovskite thin films were extensively studied during the last years .",
    "the sto(001 ) surface structure was analyzed by means of low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) @xcite , reflection high energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) , x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) and ultraviolet electron spectroscopy ( ups ) @xcite , medium energy ion scattering ( meis ) @xcite , and surface x - ray diffraction ( sxrd ) @xcite .",
    "the most recent experimental studies on the sto(001 ) include a combination of xps , leed , and time - of - flight scattering and recoiling spectrometry ( tof - sars ) @xcite , and ups and metastable impact electron spectroscopy ( mies ) @xcite .",
    "the bto and pto surfaces are less studied .",
    "the first _ ab initio _ calculations of the abo@xmath4 perovskite surfaces were presented by kimura _",
    "et al . _ in 1995 @xcite .",
    "since then a number of calculations were performed , using different methods , _",
    "e.g. _ linearized augmented plane waves ( lapw ) @xcite , pw ultrasoft - pseudopotential @xcite , hartree - fock ( hf ) @xcite . recently",
    ", new studies on the sto(001 ) surface relaxation were performed using density functional theory ( dft ) with plane wave ( pw ) basis set ( dft - pw method ) @xcite and shell model ( sm ) simulations with parameters obtained from first - principles lapw method @xcite . in most of these studies dft and",
    "plane - wave basis sets were used ( the only exception is hf study @xcite ) .",
    "it is well - known that dft considerably underestimate the band gap . on the other hand ,",
    "band gap obtained through the hf calculations is usually an overestimate @xcite . to solve this problem , the functionals containing _  hybrid \" _ of the non - local hf exchange , dft exchange , and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) correlation functionals , and known as b3lyp and b3pw ( which are quite popular in quantum chemistry of molecules ) @xcite could be used . recently",
    ", periodic - structure _ ab initio _ hybrid calculations were carried out for wide range of crystalline materials @xcite , as well as for perovskites and their surfaces @xcite . in all cases",
    "the hybrid functional technique shows the best agreement with experimental data for both bulk geometry and optical properties of materials under investigation . in this paper",
    "we continue our own theoretical investigation of the surfaces of perovskite materials .",
    "these have been carried out using both semi - empirical sm @xcite and _ ab initio _ hf and dft methods @xcite .",
    "mostly , these studies are dedicated to sto(001 ) surfaces .",
    "we studied the effects of different type of hamiltonians ( varied from dft - lda to hf with _ posteriori _ corrections ) on surfaces properties and atomic structure .",
    "this analysis allowed us to choose the b3pw functional as the best for describing the bulk properties of all three perovskites under consideration @xcite as well as the basic surface properties @xcite .",
    "this is why in the present study we use b3pw for comparing the atomic structure and the electronic properties of the ( 001 ) surfaces of three similar perovskites , sto , bto , and pto . in our simulations ,",
    "the ( 001 ) surfaces of perovskites are calculated using a _ slab _ model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section * 2 * we present the technical details of calculations and methodology . in section * 3 * we discuss the surface structure and the electronic properties of the ( 001 ) surfaces .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section * 4*.",
    "to perform the first - principles dft - b3pw calculations , the crystal98 computer code @xcite was used .",
    "this code uses localized gaussian - type functions ( gtf ) localized at atoms as the basis for an expansion of the crystalline orbitals . the ability to calculate the electronic structure of materials within both hf and kohn - sham ( ks ) hamiltonians and implementation of purely 2d slab model without its artificial repetition along the _ z _ axis , are the main advantages of this code .",
    "however , in order to employ the lcao - gtf method , it is desirable to optimize the basis sets ( bs ) , which would be suitable for the electronic structure computations .",
    "such bs s optimization for all three perovskites is developed and discussed in ref .",
    "unlike the standard basis set @xcite , we added the polarized o @xmath6 orbitals , replaced the ti inner core orbitals by the small - core hay - wadt presudopotentials , and consistently used the two diffuse @xmath7 and @xmath8 gaussians as the separate basis orbitals on the ti , ba , sr and pb .    our calculations were performed using the hybrid exchange - correlation b3pw functional involving a hybrid of non - local fock exact exchange and becke s three - parameter gradient corrected exchange functional @xcite combined with the non - local gradient corrected correlation potential by perdew and wang @xcite .",
    "the hay - wadt small - core ecp s @xcite were adopted for ti , sr , and ba atoms @xcite .",
    "the  small - core \" ecp s replace only inner core orbitals , but orbitals for outer core electrons as well as for valence electrons are calculated self - consistently .",
    "light oxygen atoms were left with the full electron bs .",
    "the bss were adopted in the following forms : o - 8 - 411(1d)g ( the first shell is of _ s_-type and is a contraction of eight gaussian type functions , then there are three _ sp_-shells and one _ d_-shell ) , ti - 411(311d)g , sr and ba - 311(1d)g ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "the reciprocal space integration was performed by the sampling the brillouin zone of the unit cell with the @xmath9 pack - monkhorst net @xcite , that provides the balanced summation in direct and reciprocal lattices @xcite . to achieve high accuracy ,",
    "large enough tolerances of 7 , 8 , 7 , 7 , 14 , ( i.e. the calculation of integrals with an accuracy of 10@xmath10 ) were chosen for the coulomb overlap , coulomb penetration , exchange overlap , the first exchange pseudo - overlap , and for the second exchange pseudo - overlap respectively @xcite .",
    "the abo@xmath4(001 ) surfaces were modelled considering the crystal as a set of crystalline planes perpendicular to the given surface , and cutting out 2d slab of a finite thickness , periodic in _ x - y _ plane .",
    "the symmetrical 7-plane slabs are either ao- or tio@xmath11-terminated .",
    "these are non - stoichiometric with unit cell formulas a@xmath12b@xmath4o@xmath13 and a@xmath4b@xmath12o@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "asymmetrical slab is ao- and tio@xmath11-terminated ( from each side , respectively ) , and stoichiometric with a formula a@xmath12b@xmath12o@xmath15 unit cell  are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ surfaces ] .",
    "these slabs containing seven planes ( symmetric ) and eight planes ( asymmetric ) can be considered as thick enough since the convergence of calculated slab total energy per abo@xmath4 unit is achieved .",
    "this energy differs less than @xmath16 hartree for 7- and 9-layered ( or 8- and 10-layered for asymmetrical termination ) slabs for all three perovskites .",
    "the symmetric slabs have advantage of no dipole moment perpendicular to the slab",
    ". however , their non - stoichiometry can potentially affect the electronic density distributions and thus atomic displacements .",
    "on the other hand , since the effective atomic charges of ti and o ions differ from the ionic charges + 4e , -2e ( due to the covalency contribution in ti - o chemical bonding ) , the alternating tio@xmath11 and ao planes are slightly charged , which produces in the asymmetrical slab certain dipole moment perpendicular to the slab .",
    "this dipole moment is cancelled by the electronic density redistribution near the surface which also can affect the optimized atomic displacements .",
    "this is why a critical comparison of these two slab models is important for making reliable conclusions .    in order to compare surface properties of three perovskites , we study here their high - symmetry cubic ( _ pm3 m _ ) phases .",
    "the calculated bulk lattice constants ( in  ) are : @xmath17 for sto , @xmath18 for bto , and @xmath19 for pto , which demonstrates the excellent agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "in present surface structure simulations we allowed atoms of two outermost surface layers to relax along the @xmath20 axis ( by symmetry , surfaces of perfect cubic crystals have no forces along the @xmath21- and @xmath22-axes ) .",
    "displacements of third layer atoms were found negligibly small in our calculations and thus are not treated .",
    "the optimization of atomic coordinates was done through the slab total energy minimization using our own computer code which implements conjugated gradients optimization technique @xcite with a numerical computation of derivatives .",
    "our calculated atomic displacements are presented in table [ surf - relax ] and are schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ relax ] .",
    "a comparison with the surface atomic displacements obtained by other quantum mechanical ( qm ) calculations is also done in table [ surf - relax ] .",
    "the relaxation of surface metal atoms is much larger than that of oxygens which leads to a considerable _ rumpling _ of the outermost plane .",
    "atoms of the first surface layer relax inwards , _",
    "i.e. _ towards the bulk .",
    "the two exceptions are the top oxygens of sto sro - terminated and pto tio@xmath11-terminated surfaces ( the latter pw - pseudopotential calculations are in disagreement @xcite , however the magnitudes of both displacements are relative small , 0.31 and -0.34 per cents of lattice constant , respectively . )",
    "the outward relaxation of all atoms in the second layer is found for all three perovskites and both terminations .",
    "the displacements obtained for asymmetrically terminated slabs are practically the same as for those symmetrically terminated .",
    "this means that both slab models are reliable for the calculations of the ( 001 ) neutral surfaces and that 7 - 8 plane slabs thick enough .",

    "the partly covalent nature of pb - o bond in lead titanate crystal due to hybridization of pb 6__s _ _ ao state with the o 2__p _ _ ao is already pronounced in the bulk @xcite , but due to bond shortening ( due to surface relaxation ) its covalency is increased .",

    "this means , in reality the covalent contribution in pb - o bond in pto is quite weak and plays negligible role in the covalency of a whole pto crystal .",
    "note that the calculated pb - o bond population considerably depends on the mulliken population analysis and the pb atomic bs @xcite , whose the most diffuse exponent ( 0.142 bohr@xmath34 ) mainly contributes into the increase of covalency .",
    "indeed , recently suggested new approach for the population analysis using minimal valence basis of wannier type atomic orbitals ( wtao ) @xcite ( which are directly connected to the electronic band structure ) predicts practicaly ionic pb charge @xmath35 for the bulk pto crystal .",
    "thus , our calculated pb - o bond population can be interpreted as an increase of the electron attraction between pb and o ions rather a real covalency .",

    "[ pto - band ] , [ pto-1x1x4-dos ] , [ pto - pbo - dos ] , [ pto - tio2-dos ] , and table [ gap ] ) .",
    "the narrowest gap of both , bulk and surface band structures corresponds to the transition between @xmath36 and x points of the brillouin zone . in the bulk",
    ", the vb top is formed significantly by pb @xmath50 aos ( which also make the main contribution to the vb _ bottom _ ) .",
    "the bulk cb bottom consist of ti @xmath44 aos , as in two other perovskites .",
    "surprisingly , the optical band gaps in pbo - terminated surfaces are not smaller , as in bto and sto , but even a little bit increases ( up to 2.96 ev with respect to 2.87 in the bulk ) .",
    "the vb top in the pbo - terminated surface consists of a mixture of pb @xmath50 and o @xmath43 aos from a third layer , whereas the cb bottom is formed by ti @xmath44 aos from a subsurface layer .",
    "the vb top for the tio@xmath11-terminated pto(001 ) surface at the x point consists of a mixture of the o @xmath43 and pb @xmath50 aos from _ both _ surface and central layers .",
    "moreover , the main contribution comes from the orbitals of _ central _ atoms .",
    "the cb bottom for the tio@xmath11-terminated pto consists mainly of the ti @xmath44 aos from a third layer .",
    "the band structure calculated for the asymmetrical pto slab shows a mixture of the band structures of the two symmetrical slabs , as it was observed for sto and bto .",
    "using hybrid dft - hf b3pw method , we calculated the surface relaxation and the electronic structure of the two possible terminations of the ( 001 ) surfaces for sto , bto and pto perovskite crystals .",
    "the data obtained for the surface structure are in good agreement with available results of theoretical _ ab initio _ calculations and with experimental data .",
    "the computed relaxed surface energies are quite low ,  1 - 1.5 ev per unit cell .",
    "this indicates that the surfaces with both termination are quite stable , in agreement with ideas of a  weak polarity \" @xcite and existing experiments .",
    "the analysis of the atomic dipole moments shows that the cations on the ao - terminated surfaces reveal the strong electronic polarization along the @xmath20-axis .",
    "the calculated difference electron density maps and bond populations demonstrate an increase of the ti - o bond covalency near the surfaces , and additionally a weak covalency ( polarization ) of the pb - o bond on the pbo terminated surface .",
    "the observed absence of the surface electronic states in the upper vb for the ao - terminated ( 001 ) surfaces and considerable (  0.5 ev ) reduction of the gap for the tio@xmath11-terminated surface of all three perovskites are important factor for the future treatment of the electronic structure of surface defects on perovskite surfaces , as well as adsorption and surface diffusion of atoms and small molecules , which is relevant for catalysis , fuel cells , and microelectronics .",
