    "scalar fields have a prominent role in present cosmology not only since they provide simple inflationary solutions for the early universe , but also for their applications to late - time cosmology .",
    "in fact simple scalar field models have been employed to characterize both the inflaton , a hypothetical field introduced to drive the primordial inflationary phase , and dark energy , the entity made responsible for the late - time cosmological acceleration . in general it is believed that further degrees of freedom , beyond the ones of general relativity and standard model particles , are needed in order to account for the observations at both early and late times .",
    "a scalar field represents thus the simplest way to add just one dynamical degree of freedom into the cosmological framework , and moreover it is usually enough to describe the large - scale effects of high - energy or modified gravity theories , at least at an effective level .",
    "scalar fields beyond the standard model are however expected to possess non negligible interactions with the known matter particles @xcite , and thus to provide a fifth force deviation from the geodesic motion of freely falling bodies . because of this fifth force , experiments within the solar system set stringent constraints on any scalar field model , unless a screening mechanism , such as the well - known chameleon mechanism @xcite , is introduced . the interaction between the scalar field and the remaining matter sources",
    "is commonly characterized by the use of conformal ( sometimes disformal ) transformations , the case of scalar - tensor theories being the most popular . in a recent series of contributions",
    "a new framework for coupling a scalar field to matter , including as a sub - class the conformal coupling , has been developed @xcite .",
    "this new paradigm uses brown s lagrangian formulation of relativistic fluids @xcite to describe the matter sources at a lagrangian level , providing in such a way new possibilities for coupling the scalar field to the matter sector ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sf_theories ] ) .",
    "for this reason , and in analogy with scalar - tensor theories , the resulting new class of theories has been dubbed _ scalar - fluid theories _ @xcite .",
    "the scope of the present paper is to find static cosmological solutions , known as _ einstein universes _ , within the framework of scalar - fluid theories and to analyse their perturbations .",
    "this constitutes a simple application of cosmological linear perturbation theory for this newly introduced class of theories , which so far has only been considered for models of interacting dark energy @xcite , but in practice it can be applied to other situations , for example primordial inflation . in fact the connection between the einstein static solution and early universe inflationary theories has been made explicit in the so - called _ emergent universe scenario _",
    "@xcite , where the initial - time singularity , namely the big bang , is replaced by a past asymptotic einstein universe .",
    "when considering homogeneous and isotropic solutions of the einstein field equations , one finds that a generic solution will either correspond to an expanding or a contracting universe , the einstein static universe being the limiting case where the universe does not evolve .",
    "however , for this solution to exist in general relativity , one must introduce the cosmological constant , without it static solutions can not be found . following this line of thought",
    ", we would expect to find static solutions which are in general unstable with respect to small perturbations which favour a dynamically evolving universe , in agreement with observations .",
    "the emergent universe paradigm has then stimulated the studies of einstein static solutions , and their stability under inhomogeneous perturbations , not only in general relativity @xcite , but also in modified gravity theories representing viable alternatives to single field inflation .",
    "in particular the einstein static universes have been analysed in @xmath0 theories of gravity @xcite , @xmath1 gravity @xcite , brans - dicke theory @xcite , modified gauss - bonnet @xmath2 theories of gravity  @xcite , hybrid metric palatini gravity  @xcite , einstein - cartan theory  @xcite and non - constant pressure models @xcite .",
    "additionally they have also been investigated in loop quantum cosmology @xcite , horava - lifshitz gravity  @xcite , ir modified horava gravity  @xcite and non - minimal kinetic coupled gravity @xcite .",
    "it is thus interesting to investigate this particular type of solutions within the framework of scalar - fluid theories which might constitute alternative models of dark energy and inflation as well .",

    "the @xmath86 components  ( [ eq : ii2 ] ) reduce to @xmath168 while the scalar field equation  ( [ eq : scalar2 ] ) becomes @xmath169    once again we will now assume an adiabatic perturbation , so that @xmath91 .",
    "substituting the density perturbation from  ( [ densitypert ] ) into  ( [ eq:13 ] ) and the velocity perturbation  ( [ velocpert ] ) into  ( [ eq:14 ] ) the system of equations reduce to the following two dimensional system @xmath170    now let us introduce the following vector @xmath171 which means we can write the above system of equations  ( [ stat1 ] ) , ( [ stat2 ] ) as the following two dimensional matrix equation @xmath172 here the matrices @xmath23 and @xmath173 have been defined as @xmath174 where we have introduced the quantity @xmath175",
    "@xmath176    now to reduce the equation to a first order system , we introduce the vector @xmath177 so that the equation  ( [ matrixeqn1 ] ) can be written as the following first order autonomous system @xmath178 where @xmath179 denotes the @xmath180 identity matrix . for the system to be stable",
    "we simply require that the eigenvalues of the above system are purely imaginary .",
    "let us write @xmath181 then the four eigenvalues of the system  ( [ firstordersyst ] ) in terms of @xmath182 and @xmath183 are simply @xmath184    now we immediately see from the definitions of @xmath185 and @xmath186 that @xmath187 . thus requiring the eigenvalues  ( [ eigen ] )",
    "are imaginary reduces to the following conditions @xmath188",
    "@xmath189    for the homogeneous perturbations we set @xmath118 . then requiring @xmath190 tells us we must have @xmath131 , and @xmath191 tells us the potential must lie at a minimum @xmath192 .",
    "however , we have already seen that the static universe solution requires that @xmath115 , and hence the homogeneous perturbation can not be stable .",
    "and thus no static universe will be homogeneously stable in these derivative coupled models .",
    "now let us examine the stability against inhomogeneous perturbations .",
    "@xmath190 will be satisfied as long as @xmath193 and @xmath194 ( so @xmath195 for the @xmath119 perturbation @xcite ) .",
    "the first of these condition is always satisfied since the smallest inhomogeneous perturbation is the @xmath119 mode , which corresponds to @xmath196 .",
    "the condition @xmath191 will be satisfied as long a we are at a minimum of the potential : @xmath192 .",
    "we can simplify the quantity @xmath197 .",
    "therefore the condition for stability is : @xmath198 and @xmath199 these conditions can be satisfied for all inhomogeneous perturbations . to show this we will",
    "derives some sufficient conditions for these inequalities to be true . for positive",
    "@xmath175 a sufficient condition for  ( [ positivep ] ) to be true is @xmath200 so we need @xmath201 which is satisfied if @xmath202 which alternatively we can write as @xmath203 for @xmath204 a sufficient condition for  ( [ negativep ] ) to be true is for @xmath205 holding when @xmath206 .",
    "this can then be reduced to the following condition which will ensure the stability for all inhomogeneous perturbations @xmath207 this is a stricter condition than for positive @xmath175 .",
    "nonetheless it can still easily be satisfied for sufficiently small @xmath175 .",
    "let us examine the form of @xmath175 for different choices of coupling functions .",
    "if @xmath208 of the form @xmath209 or @xmath210 , then we simply have @xmath211 .",
    "if @xmath208 is a constant then the stability of inhomogeneous perturbations will depend not only on the value of @xmath208 , but also on @xmath212 according to the conditions ( [ eq : cond_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cond_2 ] ) .",
    "an interesting case is @xmath213 , whose background cosmology curiously results to be equivalent to the one analysed in @xcite in the context of @xmath214-essence , as shown in @xcite . according to the conditions ( [ eq : cond_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cond_2 ] ) , in this situation we find that the stability of inhomogeneous perturbations will no longer depend on the scalar field potential , but only on the constant @xmath215 . for example considering @xmath124 , which is expected for early universe applications",
    ", we will find stability approximately if @xmath216 .",
    "a similar reduction applies in the case @xmath217 , which has been studied in @xcite . in this case using the background equation ( [ eq : bg2 ] ) the conditions ( [ eq : cond_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cond_2 ] ) become again independent of the scalar field and the stability of perturbations will be determined by the constant @xmath218 .",
    "for early universe applications ( @xmath124 ) one finds stability of the inhomogeneous perturbations if approximately @xmath219 .",
    "these last examples shows that scalar - fluid models with derivative couplings can easily be used in the context of the emergent universe scenario where the stability of inhomogeneous perturbations and the instability of the homogeneous perturbations are required for the viability of this alternative model of inflation .",
    "in this work we have analysed einstein static universe solutions in the newly proposed framework of scalar - fluid models , where an interaction between an effective perfect fluid and a scalar field is introduced directly at the level of the action .",
    "we have shown that generically static solutions exist and we have studied their stability against both homogeneous and inhomogeneous perturbations , deriving the relevant cosmological perturbation equations at the linear level .    in the case of purely algebraic couplings , we are unable to find simple analytic conditions to determine the stability of our static solutions .",
    "the reason for this is the complicated structure of the matrix whose eigenvalues determine the stability properties of the perturbed solutions .",
    "we were thus forced to consider individual models and numerically explore the regions of stability .",
    "we have analysed three particular models .",
    "the first of these , assuming a non - linear exponential coupling , was shown to be generically unstable , to both homogeneous and inhomogeneous perturbations .",
    "however when a simple linear coupling is considered , namely @xmath220 , it is found that there is a small region of parameter space where the einstein static universe is stable to both homogeneous and inhomogeneous perturbations , while there is a large region in parameter space where it is stable only against inhomogeneous perturbations .",
    "this last situation is exactly the one required by the emergent universe paradigm , implying that such model can be applied to early universe phenomenology as an alternative inflationary scenario .",
    "similar results can be found with the third scalar - fluid coupling , which reproduces the well - known chameleon mechanism .",
    "this incidentally suggests possible applications of screening models to the emergent universe scenario which could be taken into account for future analyses .",
    "on the other hand , when considering an arbitrary coupling between the fluid s four velocity and the derivative of the scalar field , we are able to make some generic statements applicable to all models of this type .",
    "it is found that homogeneous perturbations are always unstable , while the stability of inhomogeneous perturbations is determined by simple inequalities ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cond_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cond_2 ] ) ) depending on the scalar field potential and the specific form of the scalar - fluid derivative coupling .",
    "particular models of this kind , the ones admitting stable inhomogeneous perturbations , are thus suitable for applications within the context of the emergent universe scenario .",
    "in general thus the results obtained in this work show that scalar - fluid theories might well constitute new interesting inflationary paradigms .",
    "their broad applications to early universe phenomenology , also as possible mechanisms of reheating , deserves to be studied in future works .",
    "it thus appears that these theories offer the possibility of studying early time and late time phenomenology using a single model based on a well defined lagrangian approach .",
