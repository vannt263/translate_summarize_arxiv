    "there have been various discussions concerning the fuzziness of spacetime @xcite-@xcite . in spite of the absence of fundamental theory of spacetime ,",
    "it is generally argued that quantum gravitational fluctuations invalidate the reality of the classical notion of spacetime , i.e. a smooth continuous manifold in the general relativity .",
    "therefore , it is widely believed that this classical notion should be replaced in some way with a new quantum notion .",
    "another unsatisfactory feature of this classical notion is that a spacetime and the gravitational degrees of freedom , i.e. a metric tensor , are independent distinct objects , i.e. in principle , it is allowed to consider a spacetime without a metric tensor .",
    "this kind of insufficiency seems to exist also at least in the present formulation of string theory , i.e. a string and a spacetime are quite different physical objects , although they are tightly related in several ways , such as the restrictions of spacetime dimensions .",
    "therefore it is desirable that a new notion of spacetime contains a spacetime itself and the physical degrees of freedom in an inseparable fashion",
    ". the construction of a quantum theory of spacetime or quantum gravity would essentially be equivalent to finding such a new notion of spacetime which contains inseparably the general relativity in its classical limit .",
    "an interesting candidate for such a new notion of spacetime comes from fuzzy spaces .",
    "the central idea is the equivalence between a spacetime and the algebra of functions on it . for a usual space ,",
    "this is the implication of gelfand - naimark theorem @xcite . considering a deformation of an algebra of functions on a usual spacetime",
    ", a fuzzy spacetime can be obtained .",
    "when the deformed algebra is noncommutative , it defines a noncommutative spacetime @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the deformed algebra can even be nonassociative @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this direction of deformation to nonassociativity would be important in allowing an algebra to contain the information of geometric structures of a fuzzy space .    in view of the above idea of fuzzy spaces , a dynamical theory of spacetime",
    "may be obtained by a dynamical theory of fuzzy spaces .",
    "a fuzzy space is defined by an algebra , and an algebra can be given by a rank - three tensor @xmath0 , which defines the multiplication rule among the algebraic elements @xmath1 as @xmath2 .",
    "therefore it would be possible that a dynamical theory of a rank - three tensor @xmath0 , i.e. a tensor model , can be regarded as a dynamical theory of spacetime .",
    "this direction was pursued by the present author @xcite-@xcite , and a number of physically interesting classical solutions of tensor models were found numerically , which represent commutative nonassociative fuzzy spheres and tori in various dimensions @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that tensor models have also appeared in some other contexts of quantum gravity .",
    "tensor models were considered as analytic expressions describing the dynamical triangulation model of spacetime in more than two dimensions and topological lattice gravities @xcite-@xcite .",
    "they also appeared in relation with the loop quantum gravity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the main difference of these previous approaches from the present one is the interpretation of tensor models . in the previous approaches ,",
    "the feynman graphs of the amplitudes of tensor models correspond one - to - one to the dual diagrams of triangulated manifolds .",
    "computations of tensor models under this interpretation need essentially quantum treatment of tensor models , which , however , requires future technical developments .",
    "on the other hand , under the new interpretation , a classical solution corresponds to a background spacetime , and the fluctuations around it will correspond to the fluctuations of the physical fields on the spacetime .    in this paper , i will numerically study the fluctuation spectra around a classical solution of a tensor model .",
    "this solution has a simple gaussian form , and represents a commutative but nonassociative fuzzy flat space in arbitrary dimensions @xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper is that the number of the low - lying low - momentum fluctuation spectra in each momentum sector agrees exactly with that of a metric tensor modulo the general coordinate transformation in the general relativity .",
    "this suggests the possibility that the effective field theory around the classical solution can be described in a similar manner as the general relativity .",
    "if this is definitely proved , this specific tensor model contains both the spacetime and the metric degrees of freedom in an inseparable fashion , and can be qualified as a quantum gravity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section ,",
    "a tensor model is defined , which has a one - parameter family of a gaussian classical solution . in section",
    "[ sec : procedure ] , the explicit procedure to obtain the fluctuation spectra and the zero modes generated from a symmetry breaking by a classical solution are discussed . in section",
    "[ sec : flcnum ] , discretization of momenta and momentum cutoff are introduced as regularization for numerical study , and numerical solutions very similar to the gaussian solution are obtained in one and two dimensions .",
    "the numerical analysis of the fluctuation spectra around the numerical solutions is carried out .",
    "it is shown that there exist some non - zero but very light modes , the distribution of which has a characteristic feature depending on the dimensions . in section [ sec : distribution ] , the distribution of the very light modes is studied further by an approximate but more efficient numerical method in one to four dimensions . in section [ sec : interpretation ] , the characteristic feature of the distribution of the very light modes is shown to be explained in a simple manner , if they are identified as the metric in the general relativity .",
    "the final section is devoted to the discussions and future prospects .",
    "the tensor model proposed in @xcite has a real three - tensor @xmath3 and a real symmetric two - tensor @xmath4 as its dynamical variables .",
    "the model has an invariance under a general linear transformation , which can naturally be identified as a fuzzy analog of the general coordinate invariance in general relativity under the interpretation of the tensor model as a dynamical theory of fuzzy spaces . without any simplifications",
    ", however , the model is quite complicated in general . therefore , in this paper , it is assumed that the two - tensor @xmath4 be non - dynamical , and also that the three - tensor @xmath3 be symmetric under the permutations of the indices .",
    "the former assumption breaks partially the general linear symmetry , and the model given below has only an orthogonal group symmetry .",
    "thus the assumption seems to break the above connection of symmetry between the tensor model and the general relativity , but the result of this paper will suggest that they are actually intimately related .",
    "the reason is not clear presently , but it may be that the general relativity is related to a broader class of tensor models than expected solely from symmetry .",
    "the purpose of this section is to construct a tensor model which has a classical solution with a simple gaussian form .",
    "this classical solution represents a fuzzy space which is essentially the same one introduced in @xcite to study a field theory on a nonassociative spacetime . in the momentum basis ,",
    "the fuzzy space is defined by the algebra @xmath5 with [ eq : cpgp ] |c_p_1p_2p_3&=&a ( - ( p_1 ^ 2+p_2 ^ 2+p_3 ^ 2 ) ) ^d ( p_1+p_2+p_3 ) , g^p_1p_2&=&^d ( p_1+p_2 ) , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are positive constants , @xmath8 is the dimension of the space , and @xmath9s are continuous @xmath8 dimensional momentum vectors .",
    "only the euclidean signature is considered in this paper . here",
    "i have used the notation @xmath10 with a bar for the gaussian solution to distinguish it from the dynamical variable @xmath3 .",
    "similar notations will be used for some other tensors which will be defined below . note that @xmath4 is non - dynamical and takes the fixed value . in a coordinate basis , after fourier transformation , becomes [ eq : cxgx ] |c_x_1 x_2 x_3&~ & ( -((x_1-x_2)^2+(x_2-x_3)^2+(x_3-x_1)^2 ) ) , g^x_1x_2&~&^d(x_1-x_2 ) , where @xmath11 . the reality condition on the dynamical variable @xmath3",
    "is imposed in this coordinate representation .",
    "the multiplication algebra @xmath12 defined by is commutative but nonassociative .",
    "this fuzzy space is a fuzzy analogue of a @xmath8 dimensional flat space .",
    "in fact , ( or ) has obviously the poincar symmetry , and , in the @xmath13 limit with fixed coordinates , the relative scale has a definite meaning . ] , the multiplication algebra approaches @xmath14 , which is the algebra of the functions on a usual continuum flat space by the identification @xmath15 .",
    "the nice property of the gaussian form is that the contraction of the indices can explicitly be computed , and the resultant tensor has again a gaussian form .",
    "the integration measure of momentum in a contraction is defined by @xmath16 .",
    "one can easily compute the following quantities shown graphically in figure  [ fig : khi ] : [ eq : kp ] |k_p_1p_1 & &    g^p_2p_4 g^p_3p_5 g^p_3p_5 g^p_6p_6 & = & a^4 ( ) ^d ( -4 p_1 ^ 2 ) ^d(p_1+p_1 ) and [ eq : hp ] |h_p_1p_2p_3&&|c_p_1p_4p_5|c_p_2p_4p_6    ( -3 ( p_1 ^ 2+p_2 ^ 2+p_3 ^ 2 ) ) ^d(p_1+p_2+p_3 ) , where @xmath17 .",
    "similarly , one finds [ eq : ip ] |i_p_1p_2p_3&&|h_p_1p_4p_5|h_p_2p_4p_6    ( p_1 ^ 2+p_2 ^ 2+p_3 ^ 2 ) ) ^d ( p_1+p_2+p_3 ) .    , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the three - vertex represents the three - tensor @xmath3 and the connecting lines represent the contractions with @xmath4 .",
    "the open ends are associated with the indices of the tensors . ]",
    "let us find an equation of motion satisfied by .",
    "from the observation of the decay exponents in and , one finds that the quantity defined by [ eq : defofw ] w_p_1p_2p_3=c_p_1p_2p_3- k^-1_p_1p_1k^-1_p_2p_2k^-1_p_3p_3 i^p_1p_2p_3 , where @xmath20 is the inverse of @xmath21 , vanishes for , if @xmath6 satisfies 1- a^32 ( ) ^6d ( ) ^2d=0 .",
    "thus [ eq : wpzero ] w_p_1p_2p_3=0 is an equation of motion which has as its solution .",
    "note that has the solution irrespective of @xmath8 , and gives a kind of unified description .",
    "there exist various actions which derive the equation of motion .",
    "the simplest one would be [ eq : action ] s = g^aag^bbg^ccw_abcw_abc. since the action is positive definite and the action vanishes at the solution , the solution is stable , i.e. all the fluctuation spectra are non - negative .",
    "in this section , i will discuss the explict procedure to obtain the quadratic fluctuation spectra of the tensor model around a classical solution , and also the zero modes generated from a symmetry breaking .",
    "the second derivative of @xmath22 with respect to @xmath3 at a solution @xmath23 to @xmath24 is given by .",
    "g^ddg^eeg^ff    fluctuation spectra .",
    "this is because the derivative should be taken with respect to the independent normalized variables , but not all of the components of @xmath3 are independent due to the permutation symmetry of its indices . in the followings , let me assume that the range of an index of the tensor is finite , i.e. @xmath25 .",
    "this is not true for the continuum momentum index in the preceding section , but a regularization will be introduced later for the numerical computations",
    ". then a natural normalization can be defined by the following @xmath26 invariant measure , ( c)^2&=&g^aag^bbg^cc c_abc c_abc & = & _ ( p_1,p_2,p_3 ) d(p_1,p_2,p_3)|c_(p_1,p_2,p_3)|^2 . here",
    "the summation is over the momentum set @xmath27 , where the order of the momenta @xmath28 is not cared , i.e. @xmath29 , and @xmath30 denotes the number of times the set @xmath27 appears in the simple summation @xmath31 .",
    "namely , d(p_1,p_2,p_3)=\\ {    ll 1 & for  p_1=p_2=p_3 , + 3 & for  p_1=p_2p_3 ,  p_2=p_3p_1 ,  or  p_3=p_1p_2 , + 6 & otherwise .    .",
    "therefore the normalized independent variables can be taken as c_(p_1,p_2,p_3)= c_(p_1,p_2,p_3 ) .",
    "thus the fluctuation spectra should be evaluated by [ eq : dsdcdc ] .",
    "c = c^0 & = & _ ( p_4,p_5,p_6 ) .",
    "d(p_4,p_5,p_6 )    & & -6 cm = _ ( p_4,p_5,p_6),, . |_c = c^0 , where the partial derivatives in the last line are taken as if all the @xmath3 are independent , and the sum over @xmath32 is over all the permutations of @xmath33 to compensate this virtual treatment .",
    "the fluctuation spectra can be obtained by diagonalizing the matrix .",
    "since @xmath34 is a complicated function of @xmath3 , the computation of the explicit formula of the partial derivatives in is straightforward but lengthy .",
    "all the necessary formula are shown in appendix a.      in this subsection , i will study the zero modes of the fluctuation spectra .",
    "a number of zero modes appear , since a classical solution breaks the @xmath26 symmetry of the tensor model in general .",
    "let me start with the standard discussion .",
    "suppose there is a classical solution @xmath23 , [ eq : eomgeneral ] .",
    "|_c = c^0=0 .",
    "the @xmath26 symmetry of the action implies that , a new solution can be generated by applying a broken transformation to @xmath36 . by considering an infinitesimally small transformation of , this implies .",
    "|_c = c^0 ( m_d^dc^0_def+m_e^ec^0_def+m_f^fc^0_def)=0 , where @xmath37 is a broken generator .",
    "namely , [ eq : zeromode ] c^m_abc = m_a^ac^0_abc+m_b^bc^0_abc+m_c^cc^0_abc is a zero mode of the quadratic fluctuation spectra .",
    "thus , in general , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the broken generators and the zero modes of the fluctuation spectra around a classical solution .",
    "the general coordinate transformation of the metric tensor , @xmath38 , in the general relativity is not linear in @xmath39 .",
    "there is an old idea that the non - linear transformation comes from a spontaneous breaking of the local translational symmetry @xcite , in analogy with the standard non - linear realizations of global symmetries .",
    "the present setting of the tensor model fits very well with this old idea , since the symmetry of the tensor model can naturally be identified with the fuzzy analogue of the general coordinate invariance @xcite and a classical solution breaks the symmetry in general .",
    "then the zero modes of the fluctuation spectra should be identified with these gauge zero modes , which are unphysical .    in the numerical investigations in the following sections , the values of momenta",
    "will be discretized in integers , and a cutoff will be introduced .",
    "namely , an index of the tensor takes the form , [ eq : a ] a=(p^1,p^2,,p^d ) ,  ( p^i =- l ,-",
    "i will also make an ansatz that there remains a @xmath8-dimensional translational invariance @xmath40 on a solution .",
    "these assumptions mean that the background space corresponding to a solution is actually a fuzzy @xmath8-dimensional flat torus .",
    "the broken symmetry is given by @xmath35 , and thus the total number of the zero modes is given by [ eq : totalzero ] # zero_total =- d , where @xmath41 is the size of the range of the index , i.e. @xmath42 .    the above counting of the zero modes can be made more detailed by counting them in each momentum sector , which will be used in numerical investigations in the following sections .",
    "the generator of @xmath40 is given by [ eq : unbroken ] m^a_p_1p_2= i ( v p_1 ) _",
    "p_1  -p_2 , where @xmath43 is a real @xmath8-dimensional vector . it acts on @xmath3 as i v(p_1+p_2+p_3 ) c_p_1p_2p_3 . therefore , because of the translational symmetry , the tensor of a solution @xmath44 takes non - vanishing values only at the vanishing momentum , @xmath45 .",
    "this implies that the momentum of a zero mode @xmath46 in comes solely from that of a generator @xmath47 .",
    "thus counting the zero modes in each momentum sector is equivalent to counting the broken generators in each momentum sector .",
    "there are two conditions for @xmath47 to be a generator of @xmath26 as [ eq : condm ] m_p_1p_2^*&=&m_-p_1-p_2 , m_p_1p_2&=&-m_p_2p_1 , where @xmath48 denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "the first condition comes from the reality of the generator in the coordinate representation , and the second one comes form the anti - symmetric property of the indices of the generators of @xmath26 .",
    "the total momentum of @xmath49 is @xmath50 .    when the total momentum vanishes , i.e. @xmath51 , the conditions are given by [ eq : condmzero ] m_-p_1 p_1^*&=&m_p_1-p_1 , m_-p_1 p_1&=&-m_p_1 -p_1 , where @xmath52 is an integer vector as .",
    "these conditions imply that @xmath53 must vanish , and for @xmath54 , @xmath55 are pure imaginary and only half of the generators are independent",
    ". therefore the number of the independent generators in the @xmath51 sector is given by [ eq : nummzero ] # m ( 0 ) = 12 ( n-1 ) .",
    "when the total momentum @xmath56 does not vanish , the conditions become [ eq : condmnotzero ] m_-p_1+p  p_1^*&=&m_p_1-p  -p_1 , + m_-p_1+p  p_1&=&-m_p_1  -p_1+p , where both @xmath52 and @xmath57 must be integer vectors as .",
    "the second condition implies that , when there exists a @xmath52 which satisfies @xmath58 , i.e. when @xmath56 is an even vector , @xmath59 must vanish .",
    "it also implies that , for @xmath60 , only half of @xmath61 are independent , each of which is a complex number .",
    "the first condition implies that the generators in the momentum @xmath62 sector is determined by those in the momentum @xmath56 sector .",
    "in fact , under the reality condition in the coordinate basis , the modes must be a combination of those in the @xmath56 and @xmath62 sectors , in the same was as @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "therefore this effectively generates an additional factor @xmath65 to each @xmath56 and @xmath62 sector .",
    "counting the number of the possible @xmath52 under the condition that both @xmath52 and @xmath57 must be in the range of , and subtracting 1 when @xmath56 is an even vector , one finally obtains the number of the independent generators of @xmath26 in the momentum @xmath56 sector as [ eq : nummgen ] # m(p)=12 ( _ i=1^d ( 2l+1-|p^i| ) -even(p ) ) , where @xmath66 is the @xmath67-th component of the momentum @xmath56 , and ( p)=\\ {    cl 1 & for  p  even  vector , + 0 & otherwise .    .",
    "note that the result includes also the special case .",
    "note also that , since the momentum of an index is bounded as , each component @xmath66 of the total momentum @xmath50 in is bounded by @xmath68 .",
    "the unbroken genenerators are in the @xmath51 sector . subtracting this from ,",
    "one obtains the formula for the number of the zero modes in each momentum sector as [ eq : numzero ] # zero(p)= \\ {    ll 12 ( _ i=1^d ( 2l+1-|p^i| ) -even(p ) ) -d _ p0 & for   |p^i|2l , + 0&otherwise .    .",
    "the gaussian solution is a function of continuous infinite momenta , and is not suited for direct numerical investigations .",
    "therefore is introduced as regularization .",
    "then , however , does not satisfy the equation of motion .",
    "there are two ways to deal with this problem .",
    "one is to obtain numerical solutions similar to to the equation of motion , and study numerically the fluctuation spectra around it .",
    "the other is to use as an approximate solution to the equation of motion , and evaluate numerically the spectra by substituting directly into .",
    "the former way will be carried out in this section , and the latter will be the subject in the next section . the former way is definite but takes longer computational time , and will be carried out only in dimensions @xmath8=1,2 with smaller @xmath69 .",
    "the latter way is an approximate treatment but is more efficient , since it does not contain the process of obtaining numerical solutions , and will be carried out in @xmath70 for larger @xmath69 .",

    "namely , zero modes are in one - to - one correspondence to the broken generators of the symmetry breaking @xmath35 .",
    "an inefficient part of the numerical computations in the previous section is the process to find the numerical solutions by minimizing @xmath106 .",
    "the reasons for the inefficiency are not only the complexity of the equation of motion , but also the existence of the very small spectra at the @xmath84 sector .",
    "the function @xmath106 has a very gentle slope in this direction , and it is hard to find its minimum .",
    "this time - consuming step can be skipped , if the analytical expression can be used as an approximation to a solution to the equation of motion .",
    "the errors of the approximation come from the cutoff and the discretization of momentum introduced in .",
    "one may appropriately choose the parameter @xmath7 of the analytic solution so that the approximation become accurate enough to study the distribution of the very light modes .",
    "if the value of @xmath10 in is small outside the range of , the introduction of the cutoff will cause small errors .",
    "this requires [ eq : alcutoff ] l^2 1 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath107 changes gently as a function of momenta , the introduction of discretization will cause small errors .",
    "this requires [ eq : aldist ] ( p^2-p^2 ) 1 for nearby @xmath108 .",
    "combining the two conditions , one obtains 1l^2 .",
    "this inequality suggests that the continuum limit @xmath109 can safely be taken by simultaneously tuning @xmath7 in the allowed region .",
    "the actual process of computing the fluctuation spectra is as follows .",
    "the fluctuation matrix is a product of two matrices @xmath110 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : km1 ] and [ fig : idc ] , @xmath111 contains some loops .",
    "the contribution of these loops can be analytically evaluated by gaussian integrations , if the integration variables are the unbounded continuum momenta , but not if they are the bounded discrete momenta . in the latter case",
    ", the loop integrals must be treated numerically .",
    "moreover the existence of the momentum cutoff would also require numerical treatment for the internal tree lines .",
    "therefore , to avoid these complexities , i employ the unbounded continuous momenta for internal lines , and compute analytically @xmath110 .",
    "and then the external momenta , i.e. the indices of @xmath110 , are assumed to take the bounded discretized momenta , and the fluctuation matrix is diagonalized numerically .",
    "this procedure would be allowed as an approximation .",
    "the analytical expressions of the results of the loop integrals in @xmath110 are given in appendix  [ app : gauss ] .",
    "let me first show the result of the numerical computation in @xmath112 , with the choice of the parameter @xmath113 .",
    "the spectra are plotted in figure  [ fig : specd1l20 ] .    .",
    "]    there one can see the clear hierarchy between the modes with the  vanishing \" spectra within the resolution of the figure and the other  heavy \" modes with the spectra @xmath85 .",
    "the number counting of the  vanishing \" spectra reproduces the result in the preceding section . at @xmath84 sector , the number is larger by one than the formula , and agrees with at @xmath114 sectors .",
    "this implies that there exists a very light mode only at the @xmath84 sector .",
    "unfortunately , this approximate treatment is not good enough to extract the very light mode .",
    "in fact , the largest value of the  vanishing \" spectra at the @xmath84 sector is @xmath115 , while the second largest is @xmath116 , and no clear hierarchy between the zero modes and the very light mode can be observed .",
    "note that , in the correct numerical computation in the previous section , there existed a clear hierarchy , e.g. @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath119 .",
    "therefore the approximate treatment in this section would be enough only to distinguish between the  heavy \" modes and the bunch of the zero and the very light modes .",
    "however , this would be enough to study the distribution of the very light modes by counting the number of the bunch of  vanishing \" spectra and subtracting the number of the zero modes .",
    "the spectra for @xmath120 are plotted in figure  [ fig : specd2l5al02 ] .    .",
    "the horizontal axis is @xmath121 .",
    "the horizontal line is drawn at @xmath122 . ]",
    "there one finds that the  vanishing \" spectra form a finite band from the origin of the vertical axis , which would be due to the approximate treatment .",
    "a hierarchy between the  vanishing \" spectra and the other  heavy \" ones can be clearly observed at @xmath123 .",
    "one can count the numbers of the  vanishing \" modes by counting the numbers of modes below a value , say @xmath124 .",
    "this reproduces the observation made in the previous section .",
    "namely , the excess of the number in comparison with the formula is three at @xmath84 , and one at @xmath114 .    in the figure ,",
    "one notices that there exist a series of spectra which leave the  vanishing \" spectra at @xmath125 and gradually merges to the  heavy \" modes at @xmath126 .",

    "one can see that , as @xmath7 becomes smaller , the width of the bunch of the  vanishing \" spectra tends to become larger , and , as @xmath7 becomes larger , the  vanishing \" and  heavy \" spectra tend to merge at lower momentum sectors . therefore , to obtain a clear hierarchy between the  vanishing \" and the  heavy \" modes in a wide range of momentum sectors",
