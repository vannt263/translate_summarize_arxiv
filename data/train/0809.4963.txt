    "pionium ( @xmath4 ) is a coulomb bound state formed by a @xmath5 and a @xmath6  mesons .",
    "its lifetime of about @xmath7  s is dominated by annihilation due to the strong interaction ( @xmath8 )  @xcite .",
    "another annihilation channel @xmath9 amounts on only @xmath10%  @xcite .",
    "pionium annihilates predominantly from @xmath11-states . in pionium",
    "the two pions interact at very low relative momentum  @xmath12 ( of the order of @xmath13 ) and in a well defined quantum states , therefore its lifetime in @xmath11-states is directly related to the @xmath1-wave @xmath2  scattering lengths @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with isospin 0 and 2 respectively  @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath18 is the @xmath19 momentum in the atomic rest frame .",
    "the term  @xmath20 accounts for qed and qcd corrections and is a known quantity : @xmath21  @xcite . the difference @xmath22 of @xmath1-wave @xmath2  scattering lengths was calculated within the framework of standard chiral perturbation theory with the @xmath23% precision  @xcite : @xmath24 .",
    "generalized chiral perturbation theory though allows for larger @xmath25-values  @xcite .",
    "thus the measurement of pionium lifetime by dirac provides the test of concepts of low - energy qcd through a constraint on properties of pion - pion interaction .    in dirac pioniums",
    "are originated from collisions of @xmath26 or @xmath27 protons of the cern ps with a typically 100  @xmath28 m thick ni foil .",
    "the experiment uses a double - arm magnetic spectrometer  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) , which is optimized to detect @xmath0  pairs with a small relative momentum  @xmath12 in their center - of - mass system .",
    "the resolution on the components of pairs relative momentum  @xmath12 is @xmath29 , which is about the pionium bohr momentum .",
    "the method of the pionium lifetime measurement  @xcite used in the dirac experiment is as follows .",
    "pioniums are produced in @xmath11-states in proton - ni collisions .",
    "probability of pionium production depends on the principal quantum number as @xmath30 . while crossing the target pionium",
    "can be excited or ionized ( form an unbound pair of a @xmath5 and a @xmath6  mesons ) due to coulomb interaction with target atoms .",
    "pairs of a @xmath5 and a @xmath6  mesons from atom break - up (  _ atomic pairs _",
    " ) can be identified through the analysis of @xmath12-spectra thanks to their distinct low-@xmath12 distribution .",
    "ionization of pionium is a process competitive to its annihilation .",
    "therefore the probability of pionium ionization in the target is a unique function of its lifetime , which is calculated with sufficient precision  @xcite .    in proton - ni collisions , besides pioniums ,",
    "may emerge low-@xmath12",
    "@xmath0  pairs ( `` _ _ coulomb - correlated pairs _ _ '' ) , which also undergo coulomb interaction in the final state but do nt form a bound state",
    ". the number  @xmath31 of _ produced _ atoms is therefore linked to the number  @xmath32 of coulomb - correlated pairs with small  @xmath12 , e.g. at @xmath33 @xmath34 .",
    "coulomb - correlated @xmath0  pairs exhibit an enhancement at low  @xmath12 with respect to the phase space  @xcite . through the analysis of low-@xmath12 spectra collected by the spectrometer we are able to reconstruct the number  @xmath35 of _ ionized _ atoms and the number  @xmath32 of cc - pairs , therefore the probability of pionium ionization in the target",
    "is measured : @xmath36 where @xmath37 takes into account relative efficiencies to detect _ atomic _ and _ coulomb - correlated _ pairs obtained by event simulation using monte carlo method .",
    "finally in inclusive @xmath0  pairs there is a background of _ non - coulomb _ ( nc ) pairs , if either or both of pions emerge from long - lived sources and thus nc - pions do not interact in the final state .",
    "the details of event reconstruction , data selection and analysis have been published in  @xcite , where the first measurement of the pionium lifetime @xmath38  s based on statistics of about 6500  ionized atoms collected by dirac in 2001 on ni target was reported .    in 20012003 dirac",
    "has accumulated more than @xmath39 atomic pairs .",
    "the data was collected on two ni foils , one was @xmath40 m thick and another of @xmath41 m thickness .",
    "momenta of proton beam was either @xmath42 ( 2001 and a part of 2002 ) or @xmath43 ( another part of 2002 and 2003 ) .",
    "here we report preliminary results of analysis , based on a part of the accumulated statistics : signals from only two of vertex detectors ( sfd and ih ) were taken into account and only events with low background conditions were used .",
    "[ fig : inclusiveql],_a _ shows the measured distribution of inclusive @xmath0  pairs on @xmath44 , which is the magnitude of @xmath12-component along the pairs momentum .",
    "while the distribution of nc - pairs on @xmath45 is uniform , the coulomb enhancement below @xmath46 reveals the number @xmath47 of coulomb - correlated pairs in the sample .",

    "the results were obtained from ( @xmath45 , @xmath48 ) 2d - fit .",
    "the data sample was divided into three periods with different target thicknesses and different proton beam momenta , thus these periods are characterized by distinct dependencies @xmath49 of the probability of pionium ionization in the target as a function of its lifetime",

    "thanks to the dedicated measurement of scattering angle in any of scatterers from the target foil towards drift chambers  @xcite the error due to multiple scattering was reduced by a factor of 2 in comparison to the first publication  @xcite . through time - of - flight measurement by vertex detectors and vertical hodoscopes downstream the magnet the amount of @xmath64  @xcite and @xmath63-pairs  @xcite were estimated , thus this uncertainty has been almost removed with respect to the previous publication . for the data analysis we assumed point - like production of coulomb - correlated @xmath0  pairs , but small part of cc - pairs originates from",
