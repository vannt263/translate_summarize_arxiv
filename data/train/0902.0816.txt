    "large photometric and spectroscopic surveys of galaxies [ e.g. sdss@xcite and 2mass@xcite ] continue to provide vast ensembles of galaxy images , but rigorous conclusions about galaxy formation and evolution hypotheses based on the full volume of information present serious computational and algorithmic challenges . for example",
    ", parametric models are widely used to derive galaxy structural parameters : brightness , size , profile shape and ellipticity . a recent study @xcite presented a bulge - disc decomposition for @xmath0 nearby galaxies .",
    "however , an accurate decomposition is stymied by degeneracies in the parameter estimation itself .",
    "a srsic  profile has 8 parameters , and the topology of the likelihood function in this high - dimensional parameter space is too complex to visualize and hard to characterize robustly . in most previous galaxy decomposition analyses ,",
    "the uncertainties of derived model parameters have not been carefully characterized .",
    "the correlations of physical properties and structural parameters of galaxies are usually assessed through _ scatter _ plots of the _ best - fit _  parameters ( e.g. maximum a posteriori estimates with formal inverse hessian variance estimates ) .",
    "these correlations are subject to strong contamination by underlying systematic correlations of each model parameter .    a bayesian approach to parameter inference and hypothesis testing naturally addresses these difficulties .",
    "the probability of model parameters ( @xmath1 ) for a given data set ( @xmath2 ) , @xmath3 , is related to the probability of the data given the model ( the likelihood ) , @xmath4 , and prior probability of the model , @xmath5 , through bayes theorem : @xmath6 in our galaxy decomposition problem , @xmath1 is the vector of parameters describing the model and @xmath2 is the image data . for a high - dimensional model space , direct integration",
    "is infeasible , and one resorts to markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods .",
    "although costly , sampling the posterior using mcmc returns a robust estimate of the model parameters . from this distribution , one may also define a _",
    "best - fit _",
    "parameter value and confidence bounds , but the real power in this approach is the natural description by the posterior distribution of any intrinsic correlation between model parameters .",
    "this power comes at a cost : bayesian mcmc requires much more computation time than @xmath7 minimization . to make this feasible for present - day surveys with large numbers of galaxies , we present a novel image decomposition package galphat  ( galaxy photometric attributes ) which uses a state - of - the - art bayesian computation software package bie ( bayesian inference engine ) for sampling mcmc efficiently and incorporates an optimized image processing algorithm to reduce the likelihood evaluation time .",
    "we will introduce the algorithm , test its performance , and present science using galphat  in the following sections .",
    "given a parameter vector @xmath1 , galphat  produces a likelihood function for an image ( pixel data , mask , psf , background ) and the bie samples the posterior for a prior distribution using an mcmc algorithm .",
    "the bie provides a choice of mcmc algorithm depending on the complexity of the problem . to date",
    ", we have found that a multiple chain algorithm with tempering @xcite is a good compromise between speed and flexibility .",
    "for the tests described here , galphat  models the galaxy surface brightness using multiple 2d srsic  profiles with arbitrary ellipticities and position angles . for computational efficiency ,",
    "galphat  pre - generates two - dimensional cumulative distributions of srsic  profile with many different @xmath8 using a rigorous error tolerance . by assigning pixel values by table interpolation",
    ", galphat  generates a model image with arbitrary axis ratio @xmath9 .",
    "image rotation is done in fourier space using three shear operations ; a rotation matrix is decomposed into three sequential shear matrices in the x , y , and x directions and then each shear operation is carried out using the fourier shift theorem @xcite .",
    "then , the model image is convolved with a given psf and an adjustable flux pedestal with a spatial gradient is added to model the sky background .",
    "galphat  uses a poisson likelihood function to describe the photon counting process .",
    "a more detail description of the algorithm will be published in upcoming method papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for testing , we generate an ensemble of synthetic galaxy images over a wide range of signal - to - noise ratios _ s / n _  and sizes using the idl program by huler@xcite .",
    "galphat  successfully recovers the input parameters with robust statistical confidence intervals ( cl ) .",
    "= 3truein    figure  [ snpar ] compares the galphat  posterior median and 99.7% cl with the true magnitude , effective radius @xmath10 , srsic  index @xmath8 and axis ratio @xmath9 as a function of _ s / n_. we define _ s / n _  as the ratio of the average flux per pixel from the source within @xmath10 to the average flux from noise [ following huler  et al.@xcite ] .",
    "we use 10,000 converged mcmc samples for characterizing the posterior . as _",
    "s / n _  decreases , the 99.7% cl range increases",
    ". however galphat  is robust and encloses true parameter within the 99.7% cl even in the extreme case of _ s / n_@xmath11 .",
    "= 4truein    to assess the performance for bulge - disk decomposition , we use simulated galaxies with a srsic  bulge ( @xmath12 ) and an exponential disk ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "figure  [ fbpar ] compares the galphat  parameter inferences to the exact values with varying bulge - to - total flux ratio _ b / t_. as the bulge fraction increases , the inference of bulge parameters becomes more reliable and the inference of disk parameters becomes less reliable , as expected .",
    "the marginalized posterior distribution for pairs of parameters show that correlations between parameters abound ; the magnitude of the correlations depend on _ b / t_. clearly , a characterization of this parameter correlation is necessary for interpreting the distribution of these parameters for the galaxy population overall and for testing hypotheses of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "galphat  provides the full posterior probability distribution of model parameter and enables us to quote reliable uncertainties for each model parameter by including all the systematic correlations .",
    "furthermore , the posterior distribution enables the computation of higher - order statistics and more general model comparisons .",
    "convergence may be slow in high - dimensional parameter spaces owing to the complexity of the likelihood function .",
    "we have found it productive to iteratively add image information using a hierarchy of successively aggregated images .",
    "beginning with the most aggregated image ( level 0 ) one computes the posterior , @xmath14 .",
    "the posterior for the next level ( level 1 ) is @xmath15 $ ] and so on .",
    "using this hierarchical data structure , galphat  reduces the run time by factors of two , depending on the level of aggregation , by accelerating convergence .",
    "also , the bie checkpoints the full state of the simulation , efficiently enabling the posterior distribution to be augmented at a later date .",
    "galphat  can be run on either a single cpu or in a cluster environment .",
    "table  [ tab ] provides galphat  runtimes for a simple one - component decomposition . of course , in addition to computing hardware , the time for your parameter estimate will depend on image size , characteristics of the model , the mcmc algorithm , the convergence diagnostic method , and the required number of posterior samples .",
    "more detailed results will be shown in the methods paper@xcite .",
    ".wall clock time for galphat [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab ]",
    "we are currently performing a bulge+disk model decomposition of 2mass @xmath16band selected galaxies with @xmath17 to derive luminosity functions for each component in the present day universe .",
    "we will investigate the effect of environment on these distributions . from these",
    ", we can compare to mass assembly histories predicted from hierarchical galaxy formation theories .",
