    "the study of single quantum systems has gained importance over the past four decades .",
    "single quantum systems have been studied using the method of quantum simulation @xcite , an approach of great significance for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "a subject that has received much recent attention in the context of the simulation of single quantum systems is _ zitterbewegung _ , a rapid oscillation of the electron between positive and negative energy states with a frequency of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the energy of the electron , so that the lowest possible zitterbewegung frequency of the electron is of the order of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this very high frequency has been an obstacle to a direct observation of zitterbewegung , but zitterbewegung has been simulated using particles that obey equations mathematically similar to the dirac equation .    the oscillatory motion due to the force exerted on an electron moving in an electric field and the larmor precession of an electron in a magnetic field are both described as zitterbewegung @xcite .",
    "studies on spintronics apply this term to the coupling between the components of the eigenstates of a system , and so this manifestation of zitterbewegung is not necessarily a relativistic effect @xcite .",
    "trapped ions are also candidates for simulating zitterbewegung @xcite .",
    "such particles obey hamiltonians mathematically similar to that of a dirac electron , such as the dresselhaus and the rashba hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "but because all these phenomena are qualitatively distinct from the zitterbewegung of the dirac - schrdinger theory , authors qualify their statements with disclaimers such as `` simulation of the dirac equation''@xcite,``zitterbewegung - like phenomena '' @xcite , `` analogy '' @xcite , `` reminiscent of zitterbewegung '' or `` zitterbewegung effect '' @xcite , etc .",
    "the essential difference between the simulated zitterbewegung observed in spintronics and the zitterbewegung of the dirac electron - henceforth abbreviated as zb - is that the former is encoded in the spin degree of freedom @xcite , whereas the latter involves an oscillation between positive and negative energy states .    with this resurgence of interest in zb",
    "it is appropriate to take a fresh look at the fundamental physics of zb . in this context",
    "a couple of issues have emerged which we will address in this paper .",
    "i. in deriving the equations of zb dirac defined a velocity operator @xmath5 each component of this operator has eigenvalues @xmath6 since the measured velocity of an electron can never equal the speed of light , this result appears to violate the principles of relativity @xcite .",
    "\\ii . because the simulations of zb are quite distinct from the original zb it needs to be determined whether the zb predicted by schrdinger and dirac is a real physical observable for a free electron @xcite .",
    "we will show that the resolution of these issues leads to a deeper insight into zb , and it will become evident that zb is indeed a physical observable .",
    "the electron magnetic moment has been theoretically predicted and experimentally measured to a very high order of precision @xcite , a fact that offers striking proof for the validity of quantum electrodynamics .",
    "we will show that the @xmath0 factor of the electron is a manifestation of zb , and thereby establish the physical reality of zb .",
    "we shall use quantum field theory to provide an insight into the physics of zb .",
    "armed with this insight we shall work within the dirac theory of positive and negative energy electron states , and apply perturbation theory to derive the magnetic moment of the electron up to the schwinger correction .",
    "we will not use feynman graphs , but it will be evident that our result is in agreement with the one obtained by the standard methods  @xcite .    in this article we shall establish these results :    \\1 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the velocity operator of the dirac electron are linear combinations of equal amplitudes of positive and negative energy states , and hence zb states",
    ".    \\2 . a field theoretical analysis of the dirac equation shows that the eigenvalues ( @xmath7 ) of the velocity operator apply to the electromagnetic field , and thus represent the velocity of the electromagnetic field , and not of the real electron .",
    "the application of perturbation theory to the positive and negative energy states offers an alternate method for obtaining the magnetic moment of an electron in a weak magnetic field , and enables us to calculate the electron @xmath0 factor to the first order ( @xmath0 = 2 ) .",
    "the zb of the electron modifies the magnetic field , and incorporating this modification into the perturbation calculation yields the schwinger correction @xmath8 to the @xmath0 factor .",
    "from dirac s equation we may write the hamiltonian for a free electron as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the electron rest energy and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are 4@xmath134 matrices @xmath14 that operate on the @xmath15 dirac spinors . here",
    "the @xmath16 are the familiar @xmath17 pauli matrices and @xmath18 is a @xmath19 identity matrix .",
    "the velocity operator @xmath20 may be defined by the relation @xmath21 $ ] where @xmath22 is given by eq.([diracfreeham ] ) .",
    "it is a straightforward step to show that @xmath23 = c\\alpha_i.\\ ] ] equivalently , @xmath24 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath25 are equal to @xmath26 for all three values of @xmath27 = 1 , 2 , 3 so that each component of the velocity operator has the two eigenvalues @xmath6    at face value it appears that this result violates the principles of special relativity according to which a particle with non - zero rest mass can not be observed traveling at the speed of light .",
    "dirac offered an explanation of this result , but he used a classical definition of velocity , that the velocity is obtained by measuring the position of the particle at two different times :    `` the great accuracy with which the position of the electron is known during the time - interval must give rise , according to the principle of uncertainty , to an almost complete indeterminacy in its momentum .",
    "this means that almost all values of the momentum are equally probable , so that the momentum is almost certain to be infinite .",
    "an infinite value for a component of momentum corresponds to the value of @xmath7 for the corresponding component of velocity ( p 262 ) @xcite . ''",
    "we can add rigor to dirac s explanation by setting up a definition for velocity as a quantum mechanical observable .",
    "the kinematic relation @xmath28 permits us to define the `` velocity squared '' operator as @xmath29 since the momentum is totally indeterminate , all possible values of ( @xmath30 ) can occur with equal probability .",
    "so the expected value of @xmath31 is @xmath32 the ratio of these diverging integrals may be evaluated by taking the limit @xmath33 of @xmath34 using eq.([vsquared ] ) , we obtain @xmath35 so @xmath36    so the expected velocity of any particle , be it luminal or subluminal , equals the speed of light . while this is an interesting result , it does not address our problem .",
    "the above derivation of the expected electron velocity did not use dirac s equation . specifically , the matrix structure of the wave equation and the spinor wave functions did not feature in our calculation .",
    "so the proof we have given above does not offer a physical insight into the dirac electron velocity operators having the eigenvalues @xmath6 we take up this issue below .    upon diagonalizing the @xmath25 matrices ,",
    "the eigenstates corresponding to the positive eigenvalue @xmath37 of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are , in that order : @xmath41 and a similar set for the negative eigenvalue @xmath42 now @xmath43 and @xmath44 are independent within normalization constraints .",
    "so by setting each of them separately to @xmath45 it can be seen that each solution contains equal proportions of positive and negative energy states .",
    "thus they are not eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "conversely , a pure positive or negative state is not an eigenfunction of the velocity operator @xmath46 a superposition of positive and negative energy states in equal proportions describes zitterbewegung ( zb ) , in which the electron oscillates between positive and negative energy states with frequency proportional to the energy difference or @xmath47 we shall next show that zb also involves a spatial oscillation with the same frequency .    the time dependent velocity operator of an electron is given by @xcite : @xmath48 e^{-2ih t/\\hbar } + c^2\\textbf{p } h^{-1 } \\label{alphadot2}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the momentum and @xmath22 the hamiltonian of the electron .",
    "the last term on the right side of the equation is the `` traditional '' velocity of the electron , equal to its momentum divided by its relativistic mass .",
    "the other terms are zb terms , oscillating with frequency @xmath50 the first term within brackets is an operator with eigenvalues @xmath7 .",
    "this term can be resolved into a longitudinal component in the direction of the electron momentum and a transverse component perpendicular to the momentum .",
    "the transverse component @xmath51 may be formally integrated to provide the displacement matrix operator with @xmath52 component @xmath53 where the constant may be set to zero without loss of generality for displacement . defining the operator @xmath54 we obtain @xmath55",
    "a zb state , which is a linear combination of positive and negative energy states , is an eigenstate of the @xmath56 operator , though not of the @xmath22 operator .",
    "so a zb state is also an eigenfunction of the @xmath57 operator .",
    "thus , for an electron executing zb the eigenvalue of the @xmath57 operator is @xmath58 this suggests that the only measurable values of @xmath52 are @xmath59 and @xmath60 . and",
    "since the measured velocity is @xmath7 , the conclusion appears to be that the electron jumps discretely from one value of @xmath52 to the other at the speed of light .",
    "this apparently unphysical result will be interpreted below using quantum field theory .",
    "zb persists when the dirac field is quantized  @xcite , showing that it is not an artifact of the single particle theory . upon quantization @xmath61",
    "is reinterpreted as the field operator @xmath62 in fock space , and the operator property of @xmath62 is borne by the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "now the electron current operator @xmath63 is expandable into corresponding time independent and time dependent terms , and these latter are responsible for the zb .",
    "there are two such terms , and each of them is expressible as a current equation @xcite .",
    "one of them represents the transverse zb current : @xmath64 + h.c . )",
    "\\label{transverse}\\ ] ] the other represents the longitudinal zb current : @xmath65\\exp ( i2et/\\hbar ) + h.c . ) \\label{longitudinal}\\ ] ] here the @xmath66 are unit vectors perpendicular or parallel to the momentum of the electron and @xmath67 stands for hermitian conjugate .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators indicate that virtual electron - positron pairs are continuously created and annihilated around a real electron which may be in a bound or a free state , and the original electron annihilates with the positron , leaving the ( newly created ) electron as the real particle @xcite .",
    "thus sakurai s conjecture has been placed on a rigorous footing , that zb arises from the influence of virtual electron - positron pairs ( or vacuum fluctuations ) on the electron @xcite .",
    "thus quantum field theory offers an intuitive understanding of zb .",
    "these results may now be applied to the conclusions reached in section [ relwaveeqnzb ] .",
    "the displacement from @xmath68 to @xmath69 may be thought of as happening at the speed of light .",
    "an electron is annihilated at the first point and another created at the second point at a later time @xmath70 such that @xmath71 .",
    "this is of course not the same as the electron itself traveling from @xmath72 to @xmath73 at the speed of light .",
    "the velocity jumps from @xmath74 to @xmath75 and back again to @xmath74 ad infinitum .",
    "the particle itself does not travel , only the field does . the dirac velocity operator expresses the speed with which the electron is transported by the electromagnetic field .",
    "the situation is analogous to the classical case of electrons being transported along a wave guide at the speed of light .",
    "here it is the electromagnetic wave that travels at the speed of light , not the individual electrons themselves .",
    "( for a discussion and references , cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    one important effect of zb is to generate a small increase of energy of the electron due to the electrostatic repulsion between the electron and its zb twin .",
    "because the time interval between the annihilation of the electron at a point @xmath76 and the creation of another at @xmath77 is exactly the distance @xmath78 divided by @xmath74 , each electron will experience the electrostatic force of its twin , since this force is mediated at the speed of light .",
    "this is therefore a relativistic effect , and would vanish if the speed of light were infinity .",
    "thus zb will cause an increase in energy of the electron in the amount @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the distance between the electron and its twin @xmath81 .",
    "so the increase of energy @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the fine structure constant ( expressed as @xmath84 in electrostatic cgs units ) .",
    "thus the rest energy of the electron is augmented to @xmath85 and so zb explains the `` electromagnetic mass due to a weak interaction between matter and radiation '' , which requires `` a small correction @xmath86 to the mechanical mass @xmath87 '' @xcite .    in the following section we shall obtain an expression for the magnetic moment of the electron .",
    "in this section we shall use the mathematical formalism of the positive and negative energy states of the dirac theory . we shall not use the results of field theory , but save those for the higher order correction to the magnetic moment that will be discussed in a later section .",
    "we shall consider a free electron at rest in the positive energy state .",
    "we shall introduce a weak magnetic field as a small perturbation .",
    "it will be seen that because of this perturbation the electron will no longer be in a pure positive state , but will be in a mixture of positive and negative states . to obtain the magnetic moment , we calculate the change in energy due to the perturbation , divide this change of energy by the magnetic field strength , and take the limit as the magnetic field goes to zero .",
    "since we are applying stationary perturbation theory , the time dependence of the spinors may be ignored , as it will disappear in the matrix elements .",
    "a free electron at rest is described by the hamiltonian @xmath88 in the absence of external fields the positive and negative energy states can each exist separately as spin up or spin down states of positive or negative energy .",
    "we write four linearly independent eigenstates of @xmath89 as @xmath90 where the first and second states have positive energy and the other two have negative energy .",
    "the eigenvalues of this hamiltonian are @xmath91 and @xmath92 the corresponding eigenstates listed above may also be written as @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 can exist in the pure spin state forms @xmath96 depending on whether the spin is up or down along the @xmath97 axis .",
    "let us consider an electron in the unperturbed state to be in a positive energy state with energy eigenvalue @xmath98 the same energy eigenvalue describes both the spin up and the spin down states in the absence of a field .",
    "likewise there is a two - fold degeneracy for the negative energy ( @xmath99 ) eigenvalue .",
    "all four states are eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath100 let us consider the unperturbed electron to have spin up along the @xmath97 axis .",
    "now we introduce a weak magnetic field @xmath101 which we take to be along the @xmath97 axis , so that the electron has spin parallel to the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "so there is a weak perturbation described by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath102 .",
    "applying perturbation theory of degenerate states @xcite , we obtain the first order perturbation correction to the energy as the eigenvalues of the matrix whose elements are @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 take on the two different values of spin ( up or down ) .",
    "( these @xmath104 indicate the spin direction and should not to be confused with the 4 @xmath13 4 matrix velocity operators . )",
    "thus the matrix whose eigenvalues we seek is @xmath106 now @xmath107 and @xmath108 while @xmath109    now @xmath110 for @xmath111",
    "thus we have the important result that @xmath112 for all @xmath113 . the first order perturbation energy @xmath114 is zero .    the perturbation energy due to second order perturbation of degenerate states",
    "is given by @xmath115 where @xmath104 expresses the spin quantum number of the unperturbed positive state , and @xmath12 the spin quantum numbers of the unperturbed negative energy states .",
    "@xmath116 and @xmath117 the energies of the unperturbed ( zero magnetic field ) negative and positive energy states respectively .",
    "@xmath118 using the result of eq .",
    "( [ firstorder ] ) we may add a vanishing term to the numerator to obtain @xmath119 using the identity @xmath120 we get @xmath121 thus @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the magnitude of the magnetic field , taken to be in the direction of the electron spin ( the @xmath97 axis ) , and we have used the relation @xcite @xmath124 in order to obtain the magnetic moment of the electron , we take the negative of the partial derivative of the energy with respect to the magnetic field strength @xmath123 and take the limit as @xmath125 : @xmath126    an important observation can be made .",
    "@xmath127 couples energy states of opposite sign .",
    "so the magnetic moment of the electron arises from the coupling between positive and negative states .",
    "it is therefore an aspect of electronic zb .",
    "this magnetic moment is identical with the one obtained from the non - relativistic pauli equation which does not explicitly make use of positive and negative energy states @xcite .",
    "however , it must be kept in mind that the expression for the kinetic energy of a non - relativistic particle is nothing but an approximation for the relativistic kinetic energy at small velocities @xmath128 it is evident that the exponent 2 in the numerator of the nonrelativistic kinetic energy expression came from the power of @xmath129 inside the radical , and the factor 2 in the denominator arises from the quadratic nature of the square root , which is the basis for the dirac theory of negative energy states .",
    "we showed above that the denominator @xmath130 in the magnetic moment arises from the energy difference between the positive and negative energy states of a stationary electron ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "we may therefore conclude that the magnetic moment of the electron is an integral feature of the dirac theory of positive and negative energy states of a spin half charged particle .",
    "we shall next show that a higher order correction ( the schwinger correction ) to the magnetic moment shows even more clearly the explicit link between zb and the magnetic moment .",
    "it was shown in section [ relwaveeqnzb ] that the zb frequency of an electron is given by @xmath2 which is @xmath132 for an electron at rest , and that the electron executes a spatial linear zb motion of amplitude @xmath59 .",
    "a linear motion of a charged particle is converted to a circular motion in a plane perpendicular to an imposed magnetic field .",
    "though there is no physical transportation of the zb electron , yet there is a displacement of charge , and so it is a reasonable hypothesis that the effect of a magnetic field on this linear displacement is to convert it into a circular movement with angular velocity @xmath132 and radius @xmath59 .",
    "further support for this hypothesis will be provided through the use of the angular velocity operator , which we define as : @xmath133\\ ] ] it is evident that for the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath134 the angular velocity operator is zero .",
    "but if we were to introduce a uniform magnetic field we may write the total hamiltonian as @xmath135 if the magnetic field is along the @xmath97 direction then the movement of the charge would be entirely in the @xmath136 plane , giving a hamiltonian @xmath137 so @xmath138\\ ] ] for motion in the @xmath136 plane @xmath139 and this yields @xmath140 which is a traceless operator with eigenvalues @xmath141 so the magnitude of the angular velocity equals @xmath142 , which corresponds to a motion along a circle of radius @xmath143 at a linear velocity @xmath144 this angular velocity operator is independent of the magnetic field strength , and so in the limit that the external field goes to zero , we would get the zb of a free electron .",
    "a circular motion of radius @xmath143 and angular velocity @xmath142 can be resolved into two orthogonal harmonic vibrations of amplitude @xmath143 and frequency @xmath145 so letting @xmath146 it follows readily that @xmath147 has the eigenvalues @xmath148 , in agreement with the zb results .",
    "we shall now show that the eigenfunctions of the angular velocity operator are also zb eigenfunctions .",
    "one set of corresponding ( not normalized ) eigenfunctions of the @xmath147 operator :",
    "0.2 in eigenvalue @xmath149 : @xmath150 and@xmath151 eigenvalue @xmath132 : @xmath152 and@xmath153 0.2 in each one of these four linearly independent eigenfunctions is a zb state , having equal proportions of positive and negative energy states .",
    "moreover , each of these eigenstates has an even balance of spin up and spin down .",
    "this indicates that the measured angular velocity is not due to the spin but is entirely due to zb .",
    "we shall next apply a correction due to the rotation of the zb motion of the electron . we introduce a weak magnetic field of strength @xmath123 along the @xmath97 axis . in the absence of the field",
    "the zb current is linear , according to eq .",
    "( [ zbtransverse ] ) .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field on the electronic zb is to generate a rotation of the zb in the @xmath136 plane , as discussed in section [ angvelocity ] .",
    "and its zb twin at @xmath154 revolve along a circle of radius @xmath155,width=288 ]    fig.[fig1 ] shows the rotation of the zb in the @xmath136 plane .",
    "the magnetic field is directed into the page .",
    "the negative electron current has a clockwise flow according to the laws of electrodynamics . as in the case of linear",
    "zb there is no mechanical flow of electrons , and so we may picture the electron leaping from point to point along the circle without mechanical momentum . however , because there is a net circular current flow , there is a momentum due to the electromagnetic field  @xcite : @xmath156\\ ] ]     with respect to its twin @xmath154.,width=384 ]     undergoing a small displacement from @xmath157 to @xmath158,width=384 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the electron @xmath76 and its zb twin @xmath77 navigating a circle of radius @xmath59 in a clockwise direction .",
    "the situation is equivalently depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where the electron orbits around its zb twin along a circle of radius @xmath159 .",
    "the actual electromagnetic effects felt by the electron are better expressed by fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for the purpose of determining the magnetic moment",
    "it is only the magnetic effects that are of interest to us .",
    "we shall now obtain an expression for the magnetic field experienced by the electron at @xmath76 due to its twin at @xmath77 .",
    "consider a small displacement @xmath160 in the path of the electron as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . from the perspective of electron @xmath76 the zb twin @xmath77 would appear to have undergone a displacement @xmath161 ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "its twin @xmath154 undergoes a small displacement from @xmath162 to @xmath163,width=384 ]    one could relate this to macroscopic experience by analogy with a train traveling along a curved track . as the train travels from @xmath157 to @xmath164 the passengers looking out of the window would see a stationary structure at @xmath77 appear to move in the _ forward _ direction from @xmath165 to @xmath166 in our case the infinitesimal angular widths of the arcs in the figures have been exaggerated for clarity .",
    "the isosceles trianges drawn within the figures merely serve to clarify the equivalence of the two figures .",
    "so @xmath167 of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is identical with @xmath168 of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , and @xmath169 of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is identical with @xmath170 of fig .",
    "thus the electron at @xmath76 will see a negative electron current flowing from @xmath165 to @xmath171 , which means that the electron at @xmath76 will experience an additional magnetic field in the same direction as the external field .",
    "let the strength of this additional zb magnetic field be denoted by @xmath172    it must be borne in mind that at any given instant the electron is either at @xmath76 or at @xmath77 .",
    "the situation is symmetrical with respect to @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "so in calculating the change in energy of the electron it suffices to consider the change in energy of the electron at @xmath76 only .    we will now obtain the change in energy due to the effect of the external magnetic field on the zb motion of the electron .",
    "the electron current at @xmath77 will induce a magnetic field at @xmath76 of magnitude @xmath173 where @xmath18 is the current and the distance between the two electrons @xmath174 .",
    "the electron of charge @xmath175 traverses a circle of radius @xmath176 at the speed of light @xmath144 this last sentence may require some clarification . from the results of section [ angvelocity ] the zb electron and its diametrical twin orbit a common center at the speed of light @xmath74 as viewed in the reference frame of the center . by the laws of relativistic kinematics",
    "each particle will see the other traveling at the speed @xmath144 more accurately , each electron will see a charge being transported at speed @xmath144 so the current generated by @xmath154 as seen by @xmath76 is given by @xmath177 so @xmath178    the total energy of the electron due to the sum of the external magnetic field and the field generated by zb is @xmath179 since @xmath180 is independent of @xmath123 , it does not contribute to the magnetic moment of the electron which remains at @xmath181 so we need to consider a higher order correction to the perturbation energy .",
    "we next consider higher order corrections to the perturbation energy due to a weak magnetic field .",
    "we saw that @xmath182 it turns out that all the odd corrections vanish , so @xmath183 the next higher non - vanishing correction to the energy is the fourth order : @xmath184    so @xmath185\\ ] ]    here we replace @xmath186 by the corrected magnetic field @xmath187 .",
    "this yields    @xmath188\\ ] ]    the first term is fourth order in the field strength and the second term is third order .",
    "only the third term makes a non - vanishing contribution to the magnetic moment .",
    "so the correction to the magnetic moment becomes @xmath189 @xmath190    hence the magnetic moment corrected for the zb effect is given by @xmath191    thus the @xmath0 factor of the electron is corrected to @xmath192 the leading terms of the magnetic moment of the electron are therefore @xmath193 the first ( dirac ) term was derived using relativistic quantum theory .",
    "it is a quantum effect since it is proportional to @xmath194 the second ( schwinger ) term is independent of @xmath195 and vanishes as @xmath196 and so it appears as a relativistic correction .",
    "we have established that the zb predicted by schrdinger and dirac does indeed have a valid physical basis and that the magnetic moment of the electron can be understood as an observable manifestation of zb . in this process",
    "we have provided justification for the field theoretic interpretation of zb and offered an interpretation for the anomalous velocity of the dirac electron .",
    "this article is essentially a proof - of - principle study .",
    "it opens the doorway to further investigations on zb related issues , such as higher order corrections to the magnetic moment of the electron , magnetic moments of other particles , the use of feynman graphs in zb calculations , etc .",
    "the close relationship between zb and the vacuum indicated by quantum field theory invites further studies on the relevance of zb theory for the casimir effect and other vacuum related phenomena .",
