    "according to predictions of qed , vacuum can be modified by strong electromagnetic fields if the strength becomes greater than @xmath0 and , in particular , it should behave as a nonlinear media with respect to transmission of such fields .",
    "different aspects of this phenomenon ( including , e.g. , vacuum polarization , elastic photon - photon scattering , vacuum birefringence , photon splitting , pair production , etc . ) had been investigated theoretically very actively , especially after the beginning of sixties . however , at that time the researchers restricted themselves by considerations of the simplest configurations of the electromagnetic field , namely , a constant homogeneous field and a plane wave field .",
    "it was motivated , partially , by simplicity ( the dirac equation in these backgrounds admits exact solutions ) . but",
    "also , it was commonly doubted that the fields with the strength of the order of @xmath1 will be really created in a laboratory in viewable times .",
    "however , it was declared recently that this experimental task could be handled on the basis of the modern level of technology@xcite and moreover , resolution was announced to happen already in the coming decade@xcite .",
    "the high - intensity field , which can be obtained by implementation of the proposals cited above , will be most probably realized in ultrashort ( maybe , subperiod ) tightly focused laser pulses of optical range , though alternative projects based on xfel are also under consideration .",
    "therefore , in order to plan experiments in a near future , one should , firstly , examine whether previous calculations of quantum effects in a strong field can be applied to more realistic fields , and secondly , look for those new effects , which can arise in realistic fields but vanish identically in the homogeneous or the plane wave fields .    in view of this , study of nonlinear qed effects",
    "has being risen essentially .",
    "let us mention here just a few of these recent studies , which are most closely related to consideration of the realistic structure of the electromagnetic fields expected in future experiments ( for a review of other popular experimental proposals see@xcite ) . in the papers  @xcite scattering of relativistic electrons on a focused laser beams and pulses was considered .",
    "in particular , in @xcite the asymmetry of the scattered electrons observed on the experiments was explained .",
    "the papers  @xcite dealt with pair creation from vacuum by a super intense ( @xmath2 ) focused laser pulse or by two colliding pulses . in refs .",
    "@xcite a new effect of odd harmonics generation by a tightly focused laser beam in vacuum was investigated .",
    "particularly , it was shown in  refs.@xcite , that the vacuum quantum effects induced by a tightly focused laser beam or pulse can become observable when the peak strength of the field will reach the values of magnitude of about one order less than the characteristic value @xmath1 .",
    "another message of these papers was that typically these effects are crucially sensitive to the parameters and the particular type of the model of the field .",
    "however , consideration of the studies mentioned above was based on the approximate model of the focused laser field , which was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ( consideration of ref .",
    "@xcite was based on a similar but quite different model which was suggested independently by k. mcdonald though not published ) .",
    "this model can be considered as a generalization of the well - known paraxial approximation for a gaussian beam to the case of a transverse vector field ( note , that in ref .",
    "@xcite  , among the other issues , the classification of polarization types of the focused beam was discussed exhaustively ) . to take into account finiteness of temporal duration of the pulse , one , roughly speaking , multiplies the carrier field by the slowly varying temporal envelop .",
    "it is obvious that this approach is valid only for sufficiently long and weakly focused pulses . in order to check the validity of these approximations ,",
    "it is desirable to have exact focused beam and pulse - like solutions of the maxwell equations in vacuum .",
    "perhaps , the most elegant attempt to construct exact analytical beam or pulse - like field models was made in refs .",
    "@xcite for a scalar field and was recently directly generalized to the case of transverse vector fields in refs .",
    "the main idea of this technique ( now called in the literature `` the complex source method '' ) is to generate the focused fields in vacuum by the pointlike sources whose position is shifted into the complex domain ( this is mathematically equivalent to analytical extension of a retarded potential ) . a first exact analytical model of the focused electromagnetic pulse obtained by this method",
    "was manifested in ref .",
    "being compared with the approximations described above , this model revealed two new qualitative features .",
    "first , the time average of the electric field at any fixed spatial point vanishes identically , which is very reasonable . and",
    "second , it possesses some temporal analog of the gouy phase which provides chirping at the wings of the pulse .",
    "this last effect was called in  @xcite `` the self - induced blueshift '' .    in this paper",
    "we show that the usual considerations of this complex source method suffer from two disadvantages . on the one hand ,",
    "the focused field models presented in the literature thus far@xcite possess algebraic singularity , which can be attributed to some real sources ( unlike the fictional pointlike `` complex sources '' ) located on a ring in the focal plane .",
    "therefore , in a sense , these solutions simulate propagation of the focused field through a circular aperture bounded by the branch cut in the focal plane , rather than the field focused in vacuum . only in the special limiting case of weak focusing ( when the paraxial approximation works well ) this singularity escapes away to infinity and does not affect the field in the focal spot . on the other hand , as we show below , the complex source method provides analytical solutions only in the form of two colliding beams or pulses ( in the limit of weak focusing one of them disappears ) .",
    "we also sketch the method for separating a single pulse solution and discuss the possibility of its representation in a simple analytical form .",
    "the consideration below is arranged as follows . in the sec .",
    "[ sec : nfmodel ] we remind how a certain class of electromagnetic field configurations can be parameterized by an axially symmetric scalar field configuration satisfying the usual wave equation .",
    "this transformation is very close ( in fact , coincides ) to the consideration of ref .",
    ". however , in order to increase the clarity of presentation we use different notations and reasoning .",
    "existence of this mapping between the scalar focused fields and a wide class of transverse vector focused fields with clear polarization type ( say , circularly polarized e- or h - fields ) prevents us from consideration of the more complicated vector version of the `` complex source method''@xcite .",
    "therefore , in sec .",
    "[ sec : c - source ] we restrict ourselves to the more clear scalar version of the complex source method and demonstrate its drawbacks .",
    "the modifications which resolve these problems and the nonsingular beam- and pulse - like solutions of the maxwell equations are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : solutions ] .",
    "our conclusions are collected in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "consider a laser beam or pulse focused along the @xmath3-axis . in the three - dimensional transverse gauge",
    ", the electromagnetic field is expressed through the vector potential @xmath4 , which satisfies equations . ]",
    "@xmath5 let @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath3 be the cylindrical coordinates .",
    "since the pulse is confined in radial direction , the electric and magnetic fields are generally not orthogonal to the direction of propagation of the focused beam or pulse .",
    "however , as usually , an arbitrary field can be represented as a superposition of the e - field ( @xmath8 orthogonal to @xmath3 ) and the h - field ( @xmath9 orthogonal to @xmath3 ) . since an h - field can be always obtained from the e - field by a duality transformation @xmath10 , @xmath11 , it is enough to consider , say , the case of the e - field .",
    "hence , in the following we assume @xmath12 . in the simplest case of circular polarized field , the pulse consists of photons with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the total angular momentum of the photon ( assembled from the orbital momentum @xmath15 and the spin @xmath16 ) .",
    "this means , that @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the unit vector in @xmath3-direction ( compare to discussion of spherical waves in refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the general solution to ( [ j_eigenstate ] ) can be written in the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21  the arbitrary functions ( evidently , the latter equation provides decomposition of a state with @xmath22 onto the states with @xmath23 and with @xmath24 ) . by substitution of the anzatz ( [ j_eigenstate_sol ] ) into the equations ( [ j_eigenstate ] ) one obtains the following equations for the auxiliary functions @xmath21 , @xmath25 the electric and magnetic fields can be expressed in terms of functions @xmath21 by @xmath26 the equations ( [ f1eq ] ) , ( [ f2eq ] ) and ( [ f1f2 ] ) are compatible and @xmath27 can be expressed through @xmath28 by @xmath29 however , it is more suitable to express both functions @xmath21 in terms of a unique auxiliary function @xmath30 through @xmath31 then the equation ( [ f1f2 ] ) is satisfied identically .",
    "the new function @xmath32 obeys just the scalar wave equation @xmath33 and it is easy to check that the vector potential can be expressed in the following compact form @xmath34(\\hat{{\\boldsymbol{{\\bf z}}}}\\times\\nabla u).\\ ] ] for example , by choosing an approximate monochromatic solution ( i.e. , applying a paraxial approximation ) @xmath35 for the wave equation ( [ u - eq ] ) , where @xmath36 is the field strength amplitude , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 the focal radius ( @xmath40 ) , @xmath41 the diffractive length , and @xmath42 the fast phase , one comes to the particular focused beam field model , which was previously proposed by narozhny and fofanov and successfully applied to the problems of electron scattering  @xcite , pair creation  @xcite and harmonics generation  @xcite by a focused laser field .    in this way it follows that in order to construct a realistic , vector model of the field in a focused electromagnetic beam or pulse , it is sufficient to consider a cylindrically symmetric scalar model first , and then apply the mapping ( [ a_u ] ) . in the next section ,",
    "let us consider the original complex source method for derivation of scalar focused beam ( pulse)-like solutions of the eq .",
    "( [ u - eq ] ) .",
    "the idea of the complex source method looks as follows .",
    "first , consider a scalar wave equation with an arbitrary variable pointlike source @xmath43 located at the origin , @xmath44 obviously , the created field is expressed in terms of the usual retarded potential , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a retarded green function for the wave equation .",
    "now , let us shift the location of the source into the complex domain of the @xmath3 axis , @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "it is also suitable to accompany this by a temporal shift @xmath49 .",
    "then , the analytical continuation of the retarded potential ( [ u_sol1 ] ) reads @xmath50 in addition , let us choose the branch of the square root in the definition of @xmath51 so that @xmath52 , then in terms of the standard root we have @xmath53",
    ". then , according to the arguments presented in refs .",
    "@xcite  , the real part of the field ( [ u_sol2 ] ) describes a scalar field focused along the @xmath3 axis and , in particular , satisfies the source free wave equation ( [ u - eq ] ) .",
    "the viewable meaning of this complex shift transformation can be better understood by consideration in the @xmath54-space .",
    "the equation ( [ u_sol1 ] ) can be represented in the form @xmath55 and the shift transformation is reduced to @xmath56u_{{\\boldsymbol{{\\bf k}}}\\omega}$ ] . on the mass shell ,",
    "we have @xmath57 so that @xmath58u_{{\\boldsymbol{{\\bf k}}}\\omega}\\approx \\exp(-b\\omega\\theta^2/2)u_{{\\boldsymbol{{\\bf k}}}\\omega},\\quad b\\gg\\lambda\\ ] ] where @xmath59 denotes the angle between @xmath60 and the @xmath3 axis",
    ".    thus , the complex shift suppresses those wave vectors in fourier decomposition of the radiated field which are highly inclined with respect to @xmath3 , as it is indeed expected for a focused field .",
    "for example , if one chose @xmath61 then , in the limit @xmath62 , @xmath63 by applying the expansion @xmath64 , one can reduce ( [ u_sol2 ] ) to the form ( [ nfmodel ] ) with @xmath65 and @xmath66 . on merely these grounds",
    "it was proposed in the literature to introduce an additional envelop factor in @xmath43 and to consider the equation ( [ u_sol2 ] ) as an exact focused pulse - like solution of the wave equation with the shift parameter @xmath67 identified with the half of the diffractive length .",
    "nevertheless , the above arguments are not convincing enough for the following two reasons .",
    "first of all , an attempt to consider the eq .",
    "( [ u_sol2 ] ) as a solution for the homogeneous wave equation is incorrect and is based on the illusion that the source term in the rhs of the eq .",
    "( [ u_rhs ] ) after the shift , being proportional to @xmath68 , should vanish identically when the vector @xmath69 possess real valued components .",
    "in fact , a @xmath70function of a complex argument behaves in a more complicated way than its real argument analog .",
    "presence of the sources follows already from a simple observation that the transformation ( [ c_shift ] ) does not replace the pole singularities in the expression ( [ u_sol3 ] ) at the mass shell by @xmath71 .",
    "the location of the sources coincides to the ring singularity @xmath72 , @xmath73 of the expression ( [ u_sol2 ] ) , the sources are present in the exterior of this ring at the focal plane , which is the branch cut , as well . ] .",
    "this ring is picked out physically by zero delay time for radiation emitted by the complex source and crossing the physical hypersurface @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , when approaching this singularity along the focal plane @xmath73 we have @xmath75 , so that @xmath76 $ ] , which could be expected if the linear density of sources was finite at the ring . since the focal radius @xmath77 , the singularity becomes safe due to its escape sufficiently far away from the focal region which contains the most part of the field energy only in the weak focusing limit @xmath62 .",
    "however , the paraxial approximation works well exactly in this limit , so that knowledge of the exact solution becomes unnecessary in this case .",
    "another drawback of the eq .",
    "( [ u_sol2 ] ) can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ c_shift ] ) . indeed ,",
    "although due to a complex shift the wave vectors with @xmath78 become suppressed relatively to those with @xmath79 , nevertheless they remain be present .",
    "the factor @xmath80 $ ] just mimics but can not replace the true factor @xmath81 which is expected to enter the fourier decomposition of a single beam or pulse focused along @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the eq .",
    "( [ u_sol2 ] ) actually describes two counterpropagating focused fields of non - commensurable amplitudes . only in the limit @xmath62",
    "the amplitude of a pulse propagating in the direction opposite to @xmath3 becomes exponentially suppressed .",
    "the most obvious and direct way to correct the eq .",
    "( [ u_sol2 ] ) and obtain the true , nonsingular solution for eq .",
    "( [ u - eq ] ) is to take a difference of the retarded and advanced solutions , i.e. to start from @xmath82q(t')\\,dt'= \\frac{q(t - r)-q(t+r)}{r},\\ ] ] instead of ( [ u_sol1 ] ) .",
    "being a difference between two solutions of the same inhomogeneous equation , the field ( [ u_sol1_m ] ) undoubtedly represents a solution for the corresponding homogeneous , i.e. , the wave equation .",
    "in particular , ( [ u_sol1_m ] ) is non - singular at the origin ( if @xmath83 is differentiable , of course ) and its fourier transform @xmath84 q_\\omega=8\\pi^2i\\,{\\rm sgn}(\\omega)\\delta(\\omega^2-k^2)q_\\omega\\ ] ] vanishes everywhere except on the mass shell .    applying the complex shift transformation of the previous section to solution ( [ u_sol1_m ] ) ,",
    "one obtains @xmath85 ( since ( [ u_sol1_m ] ) is even with respect to @xmath86 , an arbitrary branch of the square root defining @xmath51 can be chosen in this case ) .    in order to construct a monochromatic focused beam - like solution ,",

    "consequently , @xmath103 equals to a contribution in @xmath32 proportional to the first exponent , added by an additional contribution given by the first integral taken over a closed contour passing around the branch cut connecting the branch points .",
    "this correction , however , can not be represented in terms of elementary functions .",
    "similarly , in the case @xmath108 the first integrand possesses a pole at @xmath106 and a branch point at @xmath109 , while the second integrand possesses a unique singularity at @xmath110 . in this case",
    ", the branch cuts go from the branch points to imaginary infinity and do not intersect the real axis .",
    "thus , the correction to the contribution in @xmath32 proportional to the first exponent is given by two integrals over the banks of these cuts .",
    "finally , at the ring @xmath72 the second branch point approaches the real axis and @xmath103 becomes singular .",

    "nevertheless , it seems that such expressions are very suitable for numerical calculations of both the motion of the charged particles interacting with the laser field and the quantum effects induced by it , especially in the tight focusing regime . the key point for such applications of our expressions",
