    "it has been widely accepted that a classical nova is a result of thermonuclear runaway on a mass - accreting white dwarf ( wd ) in a close binary system ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",

    "in order to further develop a quantitative study of nova light curves , a new approach is required , from which we can derive the wd mass , ejecta mass , and duration of the nova outburst .    on the other hand , some characteristic features and common properties of nova light curves have been suggested , the reasons for which we do not yet fully understand .",
    "for example , infrared ( ir ) light curves of novae often show a decline law of @xmath16 , i.e. , the flux at the wavelength @xmath17 decays proportionally to a power of time from the outburst .",
    "@xcite suggested that near ir @xmath18 fluxes of v1500 cyg ( nova cygni 1975 ) are proportional to @xmath19 in the early stages of nova explosions , while at later times they decay more steeply as @xmath20 ( see also , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite found that near - infrared light curves of v1974 cyg ( nova cygni 1992 ) showed a power law of @xmath21 in the early 100 days .",
    "recently , @xcite explained these power - law declines as free - free emission from an optically thin plasma outside the photosphere .",
    "here we further extend their approach and develop a light curve model that is widely applicable to optical and ir light curves of various types of novae .",
    "section [ modeling_of_nova ] describes our basic idea and methods as well as our light curve models .",
    "we propose theoretical nova light curves having a universal decline law of @xmath22 , regardless of the wd mass , chemical composition of the envelope , or observational wavelength bands in optical and ir .",
    "then we apply our method to three classical novae , i.e. , v1500 cyg in  [ v1500cyg ] , v1668 cyg ( nova cygni 1978 ) in  [ v1668cyg ] , and v1974 cyg in  [ v1974cyg ] .",
    "discussion follows in  [ discussion ] , and finally we summarize our results in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "after the thermonuclear runaway sets in on a mass - accreting wd , its envelope expands greatly to @xmath23 and a large part of the envelope is ejected as a wind .",

    "in a nova explosion theory , the evolution of a nova depends on four parameters , i.e. , the wd mass , chemical composition of the envelope , mass accretion rate from the companion star , and thermal condition of the wd before the ignition .",
    "our light - curve model basically follows a nova evolution after the nova envelope settles down in a steady state , i.e. , after some time has passed from the optical peak .",
    "therefore , the main parameters that govern the evolution of novae are reduced to two from four , i.e. , the wd mass and chemical composition .",
    "the other two parameters play an important role in the very early phase but do not affect the evolution solution in the steady - state phase .",
    "these two parameters are closely linked with the ignition mass and govern the free - free emission parameter , @xmath331 in equation([free - free - wind - absolute - magnitude ] ) , because it is determined by the optically thin ejecta outside the photosphere .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath331 values are different among novae , and this is a subject of a new project .",
    "the cno abundance is taken as a whole because the individual ratios of c , n , and o do not affect the evolution of novae if the total amount of cno is unchanged .",
    "it is because the energy generation of the cno cycle depends on the total amount of cno but hardly on the individual ratios in the steady - state phase of novae .",
    "the cno cycle changes only the relative ratio of each c , n , and o but keeps the total amount of c@xmath332n@xmath332o unchanged .",
    "moreover , the rosseland mean opacity is hardly changed if we choose another set of c , n , and o keeping the total amount of c@xmath332n@xmath332o constant . therefore , the individual ratios of c , n , and o hardly affect the envelope evolution .",
    "we assume that , after the optical peak , the chemical composition is constant throughout the envelope ( everywhere ) and throughout the nova evolution ( everytime ) .",
    "we expect that c or o ( or ne ) is dredged up from the wd interior in the very early phase of nova outbursts and then mixed into the entire envelope by convection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our assumption means that the convection descends quickly after the optical peak and that the envelope becomes radiative in the decay phase of novae , in which the processed helium concentrates under the hydrogen - burning zone .    from the computational point of view",
    ", we have some restrictions in the chemical compositions of opal opacity .",
    "therefore , we assume the total amount of cno as a whole set in order to reduce our computer time and have selected several sets of chemical compositions as shown in table [ chemical_composition ] .",
    "we propose a light curve model based on free - free emission and on the optically thick wind model , and have successfully applied it to three well observed novae , v1500 cyg , v1668 cyg , and v1974 cyg .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows :    \\(1 ) we have calculated light curves of novae in which free - free emission from optically thin ejecta dominates the continuum flux . the free - free luminosity is obtained from the density structures outside the photosphere , which are calculated using the optically thick wind model .",
    "\\(2 ) the free - free emission light curves are homologous among various white dwarf ( wd ) masses , chemical compositions , and wavelengths ( in optical and infrared ) . therefore , we are able to represent a wide range of nova light curves by a single template light curve on the basis of one - parameter family , i.e. , a time scaling factor .",
    "\\(3 ) the template light curve declines as @xmath0 in the middle part ( from @xmath1 to @xmath2 mag below the optical maximum ) and then as @xmath3 in the later part ( from @xmath2 to @xmath4 mag ) , where @xmath5 is the time from the outburst in units of days .",
    "this break on the light curve is caused by the sharp decrease in the wind mass loss rate .",
    "since the time of the break is proportional to the time scaling factor , we use this time of break to specify the timescale of a nova light curve in the one - parameter family instead of the time scaling factor .",
    "\\(4 ) if we know , from observation , the time of break in the light curve , we can tell when the optically thick winds stop ( supersoft x - ray turn - on time ) and when hydrogen shell - burning ends ( supersoft x - ray turnoff time ) .",
    "we can also tell the duration of the ultraviolet ( uv ) burst phase .",
    "these characteristic timescales are uniquely specified by the time of break .",
    "\\(6 ) our modeled light curves have been applied to three well - observed novae , v1500 cyg ( nova cygni 1975 ) , v1668 cyg ( nova cygni 1978 ) , and v1974 cyg ( nova cygni 1992 ) .",
    "direct fittings with our free - free light curves indicate the wd mass of @xmath13 for v1500 cyg and @xmath14 for v1668 cyg for the chemical compositions suggested . in v1974 cyg , @xmath333 is obtained for the hydrogen content of @xmath66 while @xmath14 is suggested for the different hydrogen content of @xmath71 .",
    "\\(7 ) model light curves of the 1455    band nicely follow the observations both for v1668 cyg and v1974 cyg .",
    "fitting with the uv 1455    light curves , we estimate the distances of v1668 cyg to be @xmath334  kpc for @xmath232 and the distance of v1974 cyg to be @xmath294  kpc for @xmath280 .",
    "\\(8 ) the supersoft x - ray flux was observed in v1974 cyg , which emerged on day @xmath335 and declined on day @xmath274 .",
    "this feature is explained consistently by our model . the photospheric temperature rises high enough to emit supersoft x - rays on day @xmath336 , which corresponds to the end of optically thick winds .",
    "the x - ray flux keeps a constant peak value for @xmath273 days followed by a quick decay on day @xmath274 , which corresponds to the decay of hydrogen shell - burning .",
    "\\(9 ) finally , we strongly recommend observations with the medium band strmgren @xmath9-filter to detect the break of the light curve because the @xmath9-filter cuts the notorious emission lines in the nebular phase and reasonably follow the continuum flux of novae .",

    "<S> we calculate many different nova light curves for a variety of white dwarf masses and chemical compositions , with the assumption that free - free emission from optically thin ejecta dominates the continuum flux . </S>",
    "<S> we show that all these light curves are homologous and a universal law can be derived by introducing a `` time scaling factor . '' </S>",
    "<S> the template light curve for the universal law has a slope of the flux , @xmath0 , in the middle part ( from @xmath1 to @xmath2 mag below the optical maximum ) but it declines more steeply , @xmath3 , in the later part ( from @xmath2 to @xmath4 mag ) , where @xmath5 is the time from the outburst in units of days . </S>",
    "<S> this break on the light curve is due to a quick decrease in the wind mass loss rate . </S>",
    "<S> the nova evolutions are approximately scaled by the time of break . </S>",
    "<S> once the time of break is observationally determined , we can derive the period of a uv burst phase , the duration of optically thick wind phase , and the turnoff date of hydrogen shell - burning . </S>",
    "<S> an empirical observational formula , @xmath6 , is derived from the relation of @xmath0 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the times in days during which a nova decays by 2 and 3 mag from the optical maximum , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied our template light curve model to the three well - observed novae , v1500 cyg , v1668 cyg , and v1974 cyg . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical light curves show excellent agreement with the optical @xmath9 and infrared @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 light curves . </S>",
    "<S> the continuum uv 1455   light curves observed with _ iue _ are well reproduced . the turn - on and turn - off of supersoft x - ray observed with _ </S>",
    "<S> rosat _ are also explained simultaneously by our model . </S>",
    "<S> the wd mass is estimated , from the light curve fitting , to be @xmath13 for v1500 cyg , @xmath14 for v1668 cyg , and @xmath15 for v1974 cyg , together with the appropriate chemical compositions of the ejecta . </S>"
