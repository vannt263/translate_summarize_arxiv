    "to date there are almost 500 extrasolar planets known orbiting other stars than our sun , mostly discovered via the rv method . in spite of this large effort",
    ", current surveys are giving us a biased view of the process of planet formation because less than 10  @xmath0 of these planets orbit host stars with masses  @xmath1  @xmath2  1.3  m@xmath3 .",
    "thus our knowledge about planet formation as a function of the most important stellar parameter ",
    "the mass of the host star  is poorly understood . to make progress , the search for planets over a wider range of stellar masses is essential .",
    "one strategy is to choose massive stars that have evolved off the main sequence ( ms ) .",
    "thus giants have cool temperatures ( more lines ) and slow rotation rates ( narrow lines ) resulting in excellent rv measurement precision .",
    "k giants are a class of variable stars with multi - periodic rv variations with different amplitudes and on two time scales .",
    "the fact that the rv variability in giants has higher amplitudes than that commonly seen in dwarfs suggests that it results from some specific characteristics of these stars such as lower surface gravity .    the short - period ( 210 days ) variations are likely caused by p - mode oscillations .",
    "in contrast the long - period ones occur on times scales of several hundreds of days and can be due to orbiting stellar and sub - stellar companions as well as rotational modulation due to star spots .",
    "doppler shifts caused by low - mass companions are expected to be extremely stable with time .",
    "in addition they should not induce any variations in the spectral line profile or be accompanied by variations in stellar activity indicators .",
    "we thus do not expect any correlation between the radial velocity behaviour and bisector shape or the lines of the chromospheric activity indicators ca h @xmath4 k.    by using the projected rotational velocity of the stars and their radius , we can also check that the orbital period differs substantially from the orbital period which will enable us to exclude rotational modulation . if a large",
    "surface inhomogeneity passes the line - of - sight of the observer as the star rotates , then this causes distortions in the spectral line profiles that will be detected as rv variations with the rotation period of the star .",
    "hatzes @xmath4 cochran ( 1993 ) found first indications of sub - stellar companions around giants .",
    "the first extrasolar planet around the k  giant hd  137759  ( @xmath5  dra ) was discovered by frink et al .",

    "our spectra in the north have been taken since february 2004 by using the high resolution spectrometer plus an iodine absorption cell mounted at the alfred - jensch 2 m  telescope in tautenburg .",
    "this is a grism crossed - dispersed chelle spectrograph that has a resolution of @xmath9 67,000 and a wavelength coverage of 46307370  @xmath10 when using the so - called `` visual '' ( vis ) grism .",
    "the high resolution and the large spectral range were required for the determination of rvs and chemical abundances ( dllinger 2008 ) .",
    "a high resolving power was essential to guarantee a good wavelength separation , which means that wavelengths with a small wavelength separation of @xmath11 can be resolved .",
    "a large wavelength coverage was necessary to achieve more accurate doppler shift measurements by using more spectral lines for radial velocity determinations and to provide enough fe lines for abundance analysis .",
    "both criteria are best achieved by cross - dispersed chelle spectrographs which use two separate dispersing elements .",
    "the spectral resolution is reached with an chelle grating used in high orders . a second low - dispersion element such as a grism with an orthogonal dispersion axis guarantees that the overlapping orders of the main grating do not fall on the same pixels on the detector .",
    "this grating is a cross - disperser which produces a full chellogram on the detector .",
    "the iodine absorption cell used was placed in the optical path in front of the spectrograph slit .",
    "the resulting iodine absorption spectrum is superposed on top of the stellar spectrum , providing a stable wavelength reference against which the stellar rv is measured .",
    "for the data reduction ( bias subtraction , flat - fielding , and extraction ) _ iraf _  routines have been used .",
    "rvs have been calculated by modeling the observed spectra with a high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) template of the star ( without iodine ) and a scan of our iodine cell taken at a very high resolution of 300,000 with the fourier - transform spectrometer ( fts ) of the mcmath - pierce telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "we compute the relative velocity shift between stellar and iodine absorption lines as well as model the temporal and spatial variations of the instrument profile .",
    "the spectrum is split up in typically 125 chunks , where the rv values were determined for each chunk .",
    "the achieved rv accuracy is 35  ms@xmath12 .    to complete our global search",
    "we started in november 2006 a rv survey with the _ harps _ spectrograph mounted on the 3.6 m  telescope at la silla including the best planet candidates from the previous _ feros _ study ( setiawan 2004 ) .",
    "this spectrograph has a very high resolution of 100,000 resulting in a rv accuracy of 1  ms@xmath12 using the simultaneous thar calibration method .",
    "the spectral line shape analysis ( bisector ) is crucial for the confirmation of planet candidates .",
    "the tautenburg star sample consists of 62  giants covering the spectral types k0k5 .",
    "the _ tls _",
    "target stars are well distributed over the sky in right ascension .",
    "most of the sample stars have declinations greater than +  45@xmath13 which are circumpolar at the thringer landessternwarte tautenburg and so visibility over most of the year is guaranteed .",
    "in addition the stars are very bright which ensures short integration times .",
    "their _ hipparcos _ parallaxes have an error of less than 10  @xmath0 which was essential for the determination of precise stellar parameters such as mass , radius and age for each sample star ( dllinger 2008 ) .",
    "previously known binaries were excluded .",
    "the _ harps _ sample contains 300  g  k giants including the _ feros _ sample . about 80  g and k giant stars , with accurate _ hipparcos _",
    "parallaxes , have been systematically observed from october  1999 until february  2002 with _",
    "feros _ attached at the 1.5 m  eso  telescope in la silla .    the new _ harps _ targets were selected from the bright star ( bs ) catalogue .",
    "they are also bright and well distributed over the sky in right ascension",
    ". giants with _ hipparcos _",
    "parallaxes determined to be better than 10 @xmath0 and having an intermediate ( above 1.5 m@xmath3 ) mass have been chosen .",
    "the last criteria is quite important to guarantee an enlarged mass range in order to study planet formation as a function of the mass of the host star .",
    "the first preliminary results of these northern and southern surveys are now available and will be presented in the next two subsections .      *",
    "2 stars ( 3 % ) are constant .",
    "* 15 stars ( 24 % ) exhibit short - period rv variations due to oscillations .",
    "* 12 stars ( 19 % ) belong to binary systems . * 11 stars ( 18 % )",
    "exhibit long - term rv variations which are most likely caused by planetary companions .",
    "a first result , after approximately 6 years of monitoring the giant _ tls _ sample , is the detection of only 2 stars ( 3 @xmath0 ) which show rv variations lower than 10 ms@xmath12 at all time scales analyzed .",
    "it confirms that k  giants are indeed rv variables .",
    "however , the term `` constant '' is relative and very subjective .",
    "it depends on the measurement error and the behaviour of the sample .",
    "looking with enough precision and sampling there are probably no `` constant '' k giant stars .",
    "moreover the statistics of the programme contain 15 stars ( 24 @xmath0 ) which show short - period rv variations possibly due to radial and/or non - radial stellar oscillations .    in the case of stellar companions",
    "the most important discrimination criteria are the comparatively very large rv amplitudes in the range of kms@xmath12 and the long periods of more than several hundreds of days .",
    "this is due to the fact that only the high masses of stellar companions , and not from planets , can cause these high amplitudes .",
    "the large period as the second criterion excludes furthermore short - period rv variations due to stellar oscillations .",
    "the third criterion , the turnaround points of the orbit , is not visible in all rv curves .",
    "this is a consequence of the large periods .",
    "it was only possible to obtain a small part of the corresponding long orbits during our time - restricted observations .",
    "thus the rv curves of a part of the binary candidates show only a snapshot of the whole orbit , expressed by the linear rv changes .",
    "the final proof for a binary system is the calculation of an orbit .",
    "however , to calculate such an orbit successfully , at least one turnaround point should be visible in the rv curve and enough data points should be available . at the moment for all 12  stars  ( 19  @xmath0 ) of the _ tls _ sample the most likely reason for the rv variations is that the stars belong to binary systems .",
    "the percentage of the binaries is in very good agreement with results derived from previous studies ( e.g.  setiawan 2003a ) .",
    "however , the most important result of the _ tls _ survey is the detection of 11  stars  ( 18  @xmath0 ) which show low - amplitude , long - term radial velocity variations on time scales of a few hundreds of days most likely due to planetary companions .",
    "+ figure  1 shows the @xmath14 versus m@xmath15 diagram for the @xmath16 stars . in this plot",
    "the different types of rv variability are marked with different symbols .",
    "in general the distribution of the stars with planets is quite dispersed over the entire diagram which excludes most likely the presence of possible selection effects .     for the @xmath16 stars .",
    "in addition to a main body of stars showing increasing variability with luminosity , about 20 stars stand out of this general trend , showing large rv variations . for most of them",
    "the cause of variability has been identified : planets ( squares ) , brown dwarfs or stellar companions ( triangles ) . ]",
    "* 6 stars ( 8 % ) are constant .",
    "* 7 stars ( 9 % ) exhibit short - period rv variations due to oscillations . *",
    "15 stars ( 19 % ) belong to binary systems . *",
    "5 stars ( 7 % ) show long - term rv variations which are most likely induced by rotational modulation .",
    "* 7 stars ( 10 % ) exhibit long - term rv variations which are most likely caused by planetary companions .    the southern sample has been monitored from october  1999 until february  2002 with the @xmath17 spectrograph attached at the 1.5 m  eso  telescope in la silla .",
    "the first results of this southern survey have been published in setiawan et al .",

    "( 2006 ) , pasquini et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and de medeiros et al .",
    "+ after @xmath17 has been moved to the 2.2 m  mpg / eso  telescope , we have continued to follow - up a subsample of several giants showing clear evidence of long - period rv variations . the procedures adopted to compute the rv are explained in detail in setiawan et al .",
    "( 2003a ) . +",
    "figure  2 shows the @xmath14 versus m@xmath15 diagram for the @xmath17 stars .",
    "the general behavior is similar to what observed in fig .  1 for the @xmath16 sample .",
    "however , a direct comparison with the corresponding @xmath16 plot ( see fig .",
    "1 ) clearly shows that the variability observed in the @xmath17 sample is substantially higher than in the @xmath16 one .",
    "we interpret this shift as due to the different levels of precision which were obtained in both surveys : the @xmath17 survey is less precise than the @xmath16 one .",
    "thanks to these follow - up observations we have detected 15  binary systems ( 19  @xmath0 ) .",
    "+ for 5  target stars the long - period rv variations can be explained with rotational modulation , because the rv periodical variability is related to the bisector and ca  ii variability .",
    "the @xmath17 spectra cover a wavelength region of 360920  nm with a typical signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of @xmath18  100150 .",
    "thus , one can analyze the stellar activity indicators like ca  ii  h and k , which are located at the @xmath19 values 393.4 and 396.7  nm , the ca  ii ir - triplet with the corresponding @xmath19 values of 894.8 , 854.2 and 866.2  nm , as well as the line profile asymmetry ( bisector ) .",
    "it is relevant to note as the majority of the stars showing rotational modulation ( see fig .",
    "2 ) have quite high luminosity , higher than most stars in the @xmath16 sample .",
    "this is the reason why we do not find evidence for these objects in the north .     for the @xmath17 sample .",
    "symbols are as in fig .",
    "crosses indicate stars for which rv variability is most likely induced by rotational modulation . ]      combining the northern and the southern star samples we are able to summarize first results .",
    "* giant planets around giants are fairly common ( about 1015  @xmath0 ) .",
    "this percentage is higher than the frequency of @xmath20 5 @xmath0 for solar - type ms stars .",
    "* planets around giant stars do not favour metal - rich stars ( pasquini et al .  2007 ;",
    "hekker @xmath4 melendez 2007 ; hekker et al .  2008 ;",
    "takeda et al.2008 ) .",
    "a spectral analysis of the tautenburg sample also confirms this behaviour ( dllinger 2008 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to planet - hosting solar - type ms stars which tend to be metal - rich ( e.g.  santos et al .",
    "* planets around giants have periods larger than @xmath18 150  days .",
    "* inner planets with orbital semi - major axes @xmath21  @xmath22  0.7  au are not present ( johnson et al .  2007 ; sato et al .",
    "* planets around giant stars have large masses , in the range of 310  m@xmath23 .",
    "for solar - type ms stars over half of the planets have masses less than 3  m@xmath23 . for giant stars ( intermediate stellar mass )",
    "over half of the planets have masses more than 35  m@xmath23 .",
    "although k giant variability can be complicated and can result from at least three mechanisms , the future aim of our surveys is to distinguish between these mechanisms and to verify the frequency of planets around g and k giants for our samples .",
    "of course some of the above results are caused by observational or physical biases ; the detection of low - mass planets is for instance partially hampered by the high intrinsic variability of giants ( setiawan et al .",
    "2004 , hekker et al .",
    "2008 ) , and the absence of short - period planets is naturally expected because giants have large radii and they thus would have swallowed - up any close - in planets .",
    "this region of the planetary orbital parameter space ( @xmath24  @xmath25  20  days ) is thus inaccessible .",
