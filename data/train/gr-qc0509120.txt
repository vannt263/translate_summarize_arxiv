    "the two great pillars of twentieth century physics are general relativity ( gr ) and quantum theory ( qt ) and both have enjoyed considerable empirical success .",
    "it so happens that the domain where general relativity has been well verified corresponds to situations where quantum effects ( such as superposition ) are negligible .",
    "and similarly , the domain where quantum theory has been verified corresponds to situations where general relativistic effects ( such as matter dependent curvature of space time ) are negligible .",
    "sufficiently sophisticated experiments would be able to probe domains where both quantum and general relativistic effects are significant .",
    "however , each theory is formulated in a way that requires that the particular effects of the other can be ignored and so , in such domains , we would not be able to make predictions .",
    "what is required is a new theory , a theory of quantum gravity ( qg ) , which reduces to gr or to qt in the situation where quantum effects or where general relativistic effects , respectively , are small .",
    "the problem is that we want to proceed from two less fundamental theories ( gr and qt ) to a more fundamental theory ( qg ) .",
    "how can we do this ?",
    "one approach is to try to formulate one theory entirely in the terms of the other .",
    "for example , we might try to quantize general relativity \" .",
    "this is likely to work when one theory is clearly less fundamental than the other .",
    "however , gr and qt each bring fundamental notions to the table that can not easily be accommodated in terms of the structures available in the other theory",
    ". instead a more even handed approach seems favourable .",
    "this is problematic .",
    "it seems unlikely that we can combine two mathematical formulations of two different theories in an even handed way without stepping outside those mathematical formulations .",
    "hence we adopt the following strategy .",
    "we will pick out essential conceptual properties of each theory and try to find a mathematical framework which can accommodate them . a historical example of this approach",
    "is provided by einstein himself in his invention of special relativity which resulted from an attempt to combine newtonian physics with electromagnetism . from newtonian physics",
    "he took the galilean principle of invariance for inertial frames and from electromagnetism he took the fact that the speed of light is independent of the source .",
    "these facts were set apart from their mathematical formulation in their original theories .",
    "thus , einstein stated galileo s principle in words rather than giving it the usual mathematical expression as the galilean transformations .",
    "it was only having done this that he was able to avoid the mess associated with earlier attempts to reconcile newtonian physics with electromagnetism in terms of the properties of an ether .",
    "indeed , these earlier attempts were an attempt to formulate electromagnetism in within the newtonian framework .    with the implementation of this approach in mind , we note the following .    1 .",
    "general relativity is a deterministic theory with dynamic causal structure .",
    "2 .   quantum theory is a probabilistic theory with fixed causal structure .    once the probabilistic cat is out of the bag it is unlikely that we will go back to a fundamentally deterministic theory",
    "likewise , once we have dynamic causal structure it is unlikely that a more fundamental theory will have an underlying fixed causal structure .",
    "hence , we require a mathematical framework for physical theories with the following properties :    1 .",
    "it is probabilistic .",
    "it admits dynamic causal structure .",
    "in this paper we will find such a framework .",
    "we will show how qt can be formulated in this framework .",
    "we also expect to be able to formulate gr in the framework though we do not give an explicit construction .",
    "but , of course , the real point of this exercise is that we should be able to formulate a theory of qg in this framework . and ,",
    "further , this framework should make this job easier .",
    "we will suggest possible approaches to finding a theory of qg within this framework .",
    "in gr we introduce coordinates @xmath0 . we can consider intervals @xmath1 in these coordinates .",
    "we so not say up front which of these intervals ( or which linear combinations of these intervals ) is time - like .",
    "it is only after solving for the metric that we can do this .",
    "the causal structure is dynamic . in quantum theory ,",
    "on the other hand , we must specify the causal structure in advance .",
    "one way to see this is to consider different ways in which we might put two operators , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , together .",
    "if the two regions corresponding to these operators are space - like separated then we use the tensor product @xmath4 .",
    "if the two regions are immediately sequential ( time - like ) then we write @xmath5 . in order to know what type of product to take",
    "we need to know the causal structure in advance .",
    "we seek a new type of product which unifies these two products ( along with any other products in qt ) and puts them on an equal footing .",
    "the approach taken in this paper is operational .",
    "we define an operational notion of space - time consisting of elementary regions @xmath6 .",
    "an arbitrary region @xmath7 may consist of many elementary regions . in region @xmath7 we may perform some action which we denote by @xmath8 ( for example we may set a stern - gerlach apparatus to measure spin along a certain direction ) and observe something @xmath9 ( the outcome of the spin measurement for example ) . consider two disjoint regions @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "our basic objective is to find a formalism which allows us to calculate the probability for something in one region , @xmath7 , conditioned on what happened in another region @xmath10 if this probability is well defined ( we will explain what we mean by a well defined probability \" in sec.[statement ] ) .",
    "namely we want to be able to calculate all probabilities of the form @xmath11 when well defined .",
    "we would like the formalism that does this to put every elementary region @xmath6 on an equal footing .",
    "to this end we introduce vectors @xmath12 for @xmath7 ( these are analogous to operators in qt ) .",
    "such vectors are defined for any region including the elementary regions @xmath6 . given any composite region such as @xmath13",
    "we can find the corresponding @xmath14 vector using the _ causaloid product _ @xmath15",
    "this means that @xmath14 vectors for any region can be built out of @xmath14 vectors for the elementary regions , @xmath6 , comprising this region .",
    "the causaloid product is given by the _",
    "causaloid _ which we will describe briefly in a moment .",
    "the @xmath14 vectors for the elementary regions themselves are also given by the causaloid .",
    "if this formalism is applied to qt then the causaloid product unifies the different products in qt mentioned above .",
    "we find that the probability @xmath16 is well defined if and only if @xmath17 is parallel to @xmath18 ( where the sum is over all possible observations , @xmath19 , in @xmath7 consistent with action @xmath8 ) and this probability is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the length of the vector @xmath22 .",
    "the causaloid is theory specific and is given by providing a means to calculate certain matrices ( called lambda matrices ) .",
    "the lambda matrices quantify the way in which the number of measurements to determine the state is reduced due to correlations implied by the theory .",
    "we have lambda matrices for each elementary region ( called local lambda matrices ) and we have lambda matrices for every subset of elementary regions .",
    "hence , at this general level all elementary regions are put on an equal footing . in any specific theory",
    "we will expect that some lambda matrices will follow from others . in qt , for example , it turns out that we only need local lambda matrices and lambda matrices for pairs of adjacent regions . from these we can calculate all other lambda matrices . in a particular theory we will expect to break the symmetry between elementary regions by virtue of some particular choice of lambda matrices .",
    "for example , in qt the lambda matrix associated with a pair of adjacent elementary region is different to the lambda matrix associated with a pair of non - adjacent elementary regions .",
    "however , the fact that we start with a formalism that does not impose any particular such structure from the very beginning puts us in a strong position to make progress in finding a theory of qg .",
    "the causaloid framework does not have , as a fundamental notion , the idea of a state evolving in time . however , standard physical theories such as qt do .",
    "thus , to help us put the qt in the causaloid framework , we will show how to recover a notion of a state evolving in time in the causaloid framework .",
    "having done this we are able to put classical probability theory and quantum theory into the causaloid framework .",
    "having pulled qt into the causaloid framework we can leave behind the problematic notion of a state at time @xmath23 .    any attempt to find",
    "a theory of qg in this program is likely to start by putting gr into the framework .",
    "we discuss how this might be done before considering issues that arise in qg .",
    "the important new technical results in this paper are contained in sec .",
    "[ meatstarts ] to sec .",
    "[ meatends ] .",
    "these sections are fairly self - contained and the impatient reader can jump straight to those sections on a first reading of this paper ( though perhaps skimming the earlier sections ) .",
    "we are looking for a framework for physical theories . but what is a physical theory and what does it do for us ?",
    "there are many possible answers to these questions .",
    "but we take the following to be true :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * assertion : * a physical theory , whatever else it does , must correlate recorded data . _",

    "it may satisfy our need for explanation by being based on some simple principles .",
    "but for a physical theory to have any empirical content , it must at least correlate recorded data .",
    "this sounds like a rather weak assertion .",
    "but , as we will see , it provides us with a strong starting point for the construction of the framework we seek .",
    "the assertion above leaves unspecified what the word correlate \" means",
    ". this could be deterministic correlation , probabilistic correlation , or conceivably something else . since we will be interested in probabilistic theories",
    ", we will take this to mean probabilistic correlation .",
    "what is data ?",
    "we can compile the following list of properties that data has .    1 .",
    "data is a record of ( i ) actions and ( ii ) observations .",
    "for example it might record statements like ( i ) i lifted the rock and let go ( an action ) , and ( ii ) it fell and hit my toe ( an observation ) .",
    "data is recorded by physical means .",
    "for example it may be written on bits of paper , stored in a computer s memory , or stored in the brain of the experimentalist .",
    "data is robust ( it is unlikely to randomly change ) .",
    "data can be copied so that new physical records exist .",
    "data can be translated ( e.g. english to french or binary to base 10 ) .",
    "data can be moved around ( e.g. in wires or on bits of paper ) .",
    "data can be processed ( e.g. to check that it is correlated according to some physical theory ) .",
    "the physicality of data may concern us a little - especially in those situations where we expect the physical systems which store , transport , and process the data to interfere with the physical experiment we are performing . to deal with this concern",
    "we make the following assumption    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * the indifference to data principle * : it is always possible to find physical devices capable of storing , transporting , and processing data such that ( to within some arbitrarily small error ) the probabilities obtained in an experiment do not depend on the detailed configuration of these devices where this detailed configuration corresponds to the particular data and programming ( for the program which will process the data ) whilst it is being stored , transported , and processed .",
    "such physical devices will be called _ low key_. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    without such a principle the probabilities might depend on whether the experiment is conducted by an englishman or a frenchman ( since the same data in english or french will have a different detailed physical configuration ) . this principle does not imply that the presence of the physical device which stores and processes the data has no effect on the experiment .",
    "but rather that any such effect does not depend on the detail of the data being stored .",
    "for example , a computer being used to record and process data from a nearby gravitationally sensitive experiment has mass and therefore will effect the experiment in question . however",
    ", this effect will not depend on the detailed configuration of the computer which corresponds to the data ( or at least that effect will be arbitrarily small ) .",
    "consequently the principle does not forbid the physical data devices from being part of the experiment .",
    "for example , we could throw a computer from the leaning tower of pisa to gain information about how the computer falls .",
    "it might collect data through a camera about the time it passes successive levels of the building . in this case",
    "the data device is actually part of the experiment and the principle still applies .",
    "this means that we do not need to put the observer ( for observer read physical data devices \" ) outside the system under investigation .",
    "the observer can be a part of the system they are investigating so long as they can store and process data in a low key manner .",
    "in fact , one might even argue that we must always regard the observer as part of the system we are observing .",
    "how could the data end up being collected otherwise ?",
    "of course , there are certain situations where we have reasons to regard the observer as being outside the system under consideration - namely those situations where the probabilities measured do not depend on the bulk properties of the observer . however , the important point is that we can do physics when this is not the case so long as we can have low key data devices .",
    "it is easy to imagine data processing devices which are not low key .",
    "for example , we could use a computer which stores information in the configuration of a number of large rocks rather than a standard electronic computer to store and process data about about a nearby gravitationally sensitive experiment .",
    "then the probabilities would depend on the detail of the data .",
    "the fact that we start with considerations about data where data is a collections of actions and observations puts us in an operational or instrumental mode of thinking .",
    "operationalism played a big role in the discovery of both relativity theory and qt .",
    "there are different ways of thinking about operationalism .",
    "we can either take it to be fundamental and assert that physical theories are about the behaviour of instruments and nothing more .",
    "or we can take it to be a methodology aimed at finding a theory in which the fundamental entities are beyond the operational realm . in the latter case operationalism helps us put in place a scaffolding from which we can attempt to construct the fundamental theory .",
    "once the scaffolding has served its purpose it can be removed leaving the fundamental theory partially or fully constructed .",
    "the physicist operates best as a philosophical opportunist ( and indeed as a mathematical opportunist ) . for this reason we will not commit to either point of view for the time",
    "being noting only that the methodology of operationalism serves our purposes .",
    "indeed , operationalism is an important weapon in our armory when we are faced with trying to reconcile apparently irreconcilable theories .",
    "a likely reason for any such apparent irreconcilability is that we are making some unwarranted assumptions beyond the operational realm .",
    "it was through careful operational reasoning that einstein was able to see that absolute simultaneity is unnecessary ( since it has no operational counterpart ) .",
    "the operational methodology is a way of not making wrong statements .",
    "if we are lucky we can use it to make progress .",
    "when all is said and done , quantum theory provides a way of calculating probabilities .",
    "it is a probability calculus .",
    "hence , its natural predecessor is not newtonian mechanics or any other branch of classical physics , but rather what might be called classical probability theory ( cprobt ) .",
    "thus , in the same way that cprobt can be applied to various physical situations from classical physics ( such as systems of interacting spins , particles in a gas , electromagnetic fields ... ) to calculate probabilities , quantum theory can be applied to various different physical situations ( interacting quantum spins , a quantum particle in a potential well , quantum fields , .... ) to calculate probabilities .",
    "quantum theory is , like classical probability theory , a meta theory with many realizations for different physical situations .",
    "one particular realization of qt is what might be called quantum mechanics ( qm ) .",
    "this is the non - relativistic theory for multi - particle systems in which we introduce a wavefunction @xmath24 and the schrdinger equation @xmath25 to evolve the wavefunction .",
    "qm is an example of qt .",
    "quantum field theory ( qft ) is another example of qt .",
    "the basic framework of quantum theory ( which we will present in detail below ) consisting of an evolving state @xmath26 that acts on a hilbert space @xmath27 is capable of expressing both non - relativistic quantum mechanics and relativistic qft ( see pg .",
    "49 of @xcite ) .",
    "this is clearest in the formulation of qft in which we write down a superwavefunctional @xmath28 which we can regard as a linear superposition of basis states where these basis states correspond to definite configurations of the field @xmath29 .",
    "this addresses a common misconception .",
    "we should regard qft as a special case of qt rather than something like the converse .",
    "thus we should not think of qt as a limiting case of qft - though we might attempt to derive qm as the limit of qft .",
    "it is not the case that qt , thus understood , is necessarily non - relativistic .",
    "the only point that should be added to these remarks is that qft requires an infinite dimensional hilbert space whereas we can do a lot in non - relativistic scenarios with finite dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "however , this is a technical rather than conceptual point and , in any case , there are good reasons to believe that a theory of quantum gravity will have something like a finite dimensional hilbert space . in our discussion of qt",
    "we will stick with finite dimensional hilbert spaces both for technical simplicity and because we are dealing with finite data sets .",
    "issues related to infinities and continuities will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ newcalculus ] .",
    "in going from qt to qft we have to add much additional structure to qt . however , the deep conceptual novelties of qt are evident without going to qft .",
    "for this reason it seems reasonable to look at ways to combine qt ( rather than qft ) with gr .",
    "this way we can hope to import these conceptual novelties into a theory of qg without getting distracted by the additional structure of qft .",
    "ultimately we would require that a theory of qg incorporate qft ( at some appropriate level of approximation ) .",
    "however , we take the attitude that this is not likely to be important in the early days of the construction of qg and it may even be possible to fully construct qg before taking on this consideration .",
    "we want to give a simple operational formulation of cprobt and qt and for this purpose we present a framework which works for probabilistic theories that admit a universal background time .",
    "the basic scenario we consider is that shown in fig .",
    "[ basicscenario ] .",
    "this consists of a sequence of operations on the system .",
    "we can represent these operations by boxes .",
    "each box has a knob on it which can be used to vary the operation implemented . at each operation",
    "we have the possibility of extracting some outcome @xmath30 ( this is data ) .",
    "each operation can be regarded alternatively as ( a ) a preparation ( since it outputs a system ) , ( b ) a transformation ( since it transforms the state of a system ) , and ( c ) a measurement ( since it inputs a system and outputs an outcome @xmath30 ) . the same can be said of any sequence of such operations .",
    "we can , strictly , only regard an operation as a preparation if it outputs the system in a definite state .",
    "we define the state in the following way .    _",

    "we note that we can write @xmath33 where @xmath34 has a 1 in position @xmath32 and 0 s everywhere else .",
    "the object @xmath35 contains a lot of information . in general",
    "we would expect a physical theory to afford some simplification so that some entries in @xmath35 can be calculated from other entries .",
    "in fact we can insist that this be done by a linear formula so we have a state given by @xmath36 such that @xmath37 the @xmath38 s are the probabilities associated with a set of _ fiducial _ measurement outcomes . we take @xmath39 to be the minimum number of entries in @xmath40 that makes it possible to write the state by a linear formula like this .",
    "that this will always be possible is clear since we have ( [ lastresort ] ) as a last resort .",
    "a special measurement is the identity measurement @xmath41 corresponding to the measurement whose result is positive if any result is seen . in the case that the state is normalized we have @xmath42 .",
    "however , for technical reasons , we will not normalize the state after each step .",
    "it follows from the fact that these probabilities are given by a linear formula that the transformation of the state is given by a linear formula .",
    "thus , if we obtain result @xmath30 the new state is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a @xmath45 real matrix .",
    "this is clear since each component of the new state must be given by a linear combination of the components in the initial state .",
    "the probability of outcome @xmath30 is @xmath46 the state can be normalized by dividing by @xmath47 .",
    "however , this introduces unnecessary non - linearities in the evolution of the state .",
    "it is more convenient to allow the state to be unnormalized and use the above formula for calculating probabilities .",
    "we may have more than one system .",
    "we need a way of setting up the framework for such composite systems .",
    "both cprobt and qt turn out to be simple in this respect .",
    "the state of a composite system is given by specifying joint probabilities @xmath48 with @xmath49 to @xmath50 and @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",

    "@xmath57 note that @xmath58 .",

    "the probability of outcome @xmath30 is @xmath73 and the state after outcome @xmath30 is observed is @xmath43    a few notes of clarification are useful here .",
    "we deliberately do not impose the normalization condition @xmath74 ( though we impose the condition @xmath64 to keep these vectors bounded ) .",
    "first it is not necessary to normalize since the denominator on the rhs of ( [ clasprob ] ) ensures that the sum of probabilities over all outcomes adds up to 1 .",
    "second , it is useful to allow the freedom not to normalize since then we can regard @xmath75 as a new state even though this new state is not normalized .",
    "we can , if we wish , normalize a state by dividing it by @xmath76 .",

    "he sets up the mathematics of tensors as objects which have the property that a physical law expressible by setting all the components of a tensor equal to zero is generally covariant . out of these ideas",
    "he is able , by an ingenious chain of reasoning , to obtain field equations for gr which can be expressed as @xmath145 @xmath146 is einstein tensor and is a measure of the local curvature concocted out of derivatives of the metric .",

    "it tells us how to compare local fields at two different points by providing a way to parallel transport such fields .",
    "this it does via the connection @xmath148 and the machinery of covariant differentiation .",
    "this property does depend on the variation of the metric with @xmath0 .",
    "the metric also determines causal structure .",
    "it tells us whether two events are space - like or time - like and thereby determines whether we can send a signal from one to the other .",
    "however , the metric is a dynamical feature of the theory .",
    "it is determined by solving the einstein field equations .",
    "hence the causal structure is dynamical .",
    "we can try to express this in more operational terms . given local events with local labels @xmath0 ( which may be abstract or read off some real physical reference frame ) there is no way in general to say , in advance ( that is without solving the equations ) , whether it is possible to send a signal from one to another . in non - gravitational physics we have fixed causal structure .",
    "for example , in sr the metric is fixed and so we know the causal structure in advance .",
    "gr is a deterministic theory . in classical physics",
    "we can always introduce probabilities simply by applying cprobt",
    ". however , cprobt assumes a fixed causal structure just as qt does .",
    "in particular it assumes a fixed background time .",
    "hence , we would not expect to be able to apply cprobt to gr in a straight forward manner .",
    "indeed , we could consider the program of unifying cprobt and gr to find what we might call probabilistic general relativity ( probgr ) .",
    "this program might be expected share many of the same difficulties we face in the program to find a theory of qg .",
    "we have taken as our goal to find a framework for probabilistic theories which admit dynamic causal structure .",
    "this framework should include probgr as well as qg .",
    "hence , we will need to introduce further principles to get qg rather than probgr .",
    "for such principles we can look to the differences between cprobt and qt .",
    "these differences are especially clear in the formulation of qt in sec .",
    "[ qtrzp ] which looks similar to cprobt and in the postulates introduced in sec .",
    "[ qtpostulates ] ( see @xcite for a discussion of the differences between cprobt and qt ) .",
    "the most obvious issue that arises when attempting to combine qt with gr is that qt has a state on a space - like surface that evolves with respect to an external time whereas in gr time is part of a four dimensional manifold whose behavior is dynamically determined by einstein s field equations .",
    "we can formulate gr in terms of a state evolving in time - namely a canonical formulation @xcite .",
    "such formulations are rather messy ( having to deal with the fact that time is not a non - dynamical external variable ) and break the elegance of einstein s manifestly covariant formulation . given that einstein s chain of reasoning depended crucially on treating all four space - time coordinates on an equal footing it is likely to be at least difficult to construct qg if we make the move of going from a four dimensional manifold @xmath149 to an artificial splitting into a three dimensional spatial manifold @xmath150 and a one dimensional time manifold @xmath151 .",
    "but there is a further reason coming from quantum theory that suggests it may be impossible .",
    "if the causal structure is dynamically determined then what constitutes a space - like surface must also be dynamically determined .",
    "however , in quantum theory we expect any dynamics to be subject to quantum uncertainty .",
    "hence , we would expect the property of whether a surface is space - like or not to be subject to uncertainty .",
    "it is not just that we must treat space and time on an equal footing but also that there may not even be a matter - of - fact as to what is space and what is time even after we have solved the equations ( see @xcite ) . to this end",
    "we will give a framework ( which admits a formulation of quantum theory ) which does not take as fundamental the notion of an evolving state .",
    "the framework will , though , allow us to construct states evolving through a sequence of surfaces .",
    "however , these surfaces need not be space - like ( indeed , there may not even be a useful notion of space - like ) .",
    "another way of thinking about these issues is by considering how we might probe causal structure .",
    "the most obvious way to do this is to use light signals since they probe the light cone structure which underpins causal structure in gr . in gr",
    "we are typically interested in cases where the presence of light represents only a small perturbation and so we freely employ counterfactual reasoning in which we imagine sending or not sending light signals without having to consider the effect this has on the solution to einstein s field equations . on the other hand , in qt , the presence or not of even a single photon can have a dramatic effect on what is seen .",
    "the most clear example of this is provided in @xcite in which an interference effect involving one photon depends on whether the path of another photon is blocked or not . in qt",
    "we have a fixed background causal structure ( which might be implemented for example by bolting apparatuses down to a rigid structure ) and so there is no need to employ such reasoning about the counterfactual transmission of photons for the purposes of understanding causal structure .",
    "however , in qg , we will not assume that there is a fixed background causal structure .",
    "we can not assume that two regions of space - time have a certain causal relationship in the absence of any photon being transmitted between them just because we know that their causal relationship would be fixed if a photon were to be so transmitted .",
    "this line of thinking lends separate support to the possibility mentioned above that there may not even be a matter - of - fact as to what is space and what is time even after the equations have been solved .    a more mathematical handle on this issue",
    "can be gained by considering the various ways in quantum theory we can put together pairs of operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we can form the product @xmath152 .",
    "we can take the tensor product @xmath153 .",
    "a third slightly more subtle example is @xmath154 where @xmath155 stands for an unknown operator .",
    "the first and third of these two examples correspond to a time - like situation whereas the second case corresponds to a space - like situation ( or at least an equal time situation ) .",
    "each of these cases is treated on a different footing in qt . in gr",
    "we initially treat space and time on an equal footing .",
    "thus , we introduce four space - time coordinates @xmath0 ( with @xmath156 ) giving rise to the intervals @xmath157 .",
    "we do this without saying which of these intervals ( or which linear combinations of them ) are time - like .",
    "we then solve einstein s field equations and obtain a metric @xmath144 . from the metric ( which has a lorentzian signature )",
    "we can identify which linear combinations pertain to time - like intervals .",
    "but , at least in principle , we do this after we have solved the field equations .",
    "thus , by analogy , if we are to treat space and time on an equal footing in qg as we do in gr then we would also want to put those objects in the theory of qg which correspond to the three types of product in qt mentioned above on an equal footing . this should already be an issue in special relativistic quantum theory though since the causal structure is fixed in advance it is not essential we attend to it .",
    "but in qg it is likely to be quite essential .",
    "in fact , in qg the issue is likely to be even more serious than it is in gr since it may be , as mentioned above , that even after the equations have been solved , we are unable to identify what intervals are space - like and what are time - like . in order to address this issue we will define a new type of product which unifies all these types of products in quantum theory ( and their counterparts in more general probabilistic frameworks ) putting them on an equal footing",
    ".    we should ultimately be interested in experiments to test a theory of qg . before we get to real experiments",
    "it is interesting to consider gedankenexperiments which illuminate the conceptual structure of a theory .",
    "as we noted in the introduction , a theory of qg would be necessary in a situation in which we could not neglect the particular effects of both gr and qt .",
    "the type of gedankenexperiment in which this is going to be the case will be one where we simultaneously have dynamic causal structure and quantum superposition .",
    "such a situation occurs when we look for quantum interference of a massive object which goes into a superposition of being in two places at once .",
    "gedankenexperiments of this type have been discussed by penrose @xcite and there has been some effort to design a realizable version of this type of experiment @xcite .",

    "[ datumism ] : a physical theory , whatever else it does , must correlate recorded data .",
    "data is a record of actions and observations taken during an experiment .",
    "we will assume that this data is recorded onto cards .",
    "each card will record a small amount of _ proximate _ data .",
    "we will illustrate what we mean by this soon with examples .",
    "thus the cards represent something analogous to einsteinian events .",
    "one piece of data recorded on any given card will be something we will regard as representing or being analogous to space - time location .",
    "of course , it is not necessary to record the data onto cards .",
    "it could be recorded in a computer s memory , or by any other means . but this story with the cards will help us in setting up the mathematical framework we seek .",

    "we can set each stern - gerlach apparatus to measure spin along the direction @xmath159 .",
    "then we record the outcome @xmath163 .",
    "thus we get a card from each stern - gerlach apparatus with @xmath158 written on it",
    ". we would also want to extract a card ( or maybe a set of cards ) from the apparatus which prepares the electrons .",

    "we would collect a stack of five cards .",
    "we could vary the settings @xmath159 on the stern - gerlach apparatuses . to extract probabilities",

    "[ probes ] ) .",
    "each probe has a clock which ticks out times @xmath167 .",
    "each probe has knobs on it which correspond to the settings of some measurement apparatuses on the probe .",
    "we let the different configurations of these knobs be labelled by @xmath159 .",
    "further , each probe has some meters which record the outcomes of those experiments .",
    "we let @xmath160 label these outcomes . on each card",
    "we can record the data @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the retarded time of probe @xmath170 as seen at probe @xmath56 .",
    "we may want to put more information into @xmath129 , such as the observed relative orientations .",
    "and we may want to reduce the amount of information in @xmath129 , for example we could only record the retarded times of three specific probes ( providing something like a gps system ) .",
    "we take one card from each probe for each tick of the probe clock . at the end of each run of the experiment",
    "we will have a stack of @xmath171 cards .",
    "the clocks can be reset and the experiment repeated many times to obtain probabilities .    in these cases",
    "the number of cards in the stack is the same from one run to the next but this need not be the case .",
    "we introduce the important notion of a _ procedure _ , @xmath172 , which tells the experimentalist what actions to implement - that is how to set the knobs . in our examples above ( where we record data @xmath158 onto the cards )",
    "we allow the choice of @xmath159 to depend on @xmath129 by some function @xmath173 . after a procedure",
    "has been implemented we will end up with a stack , @xmath174 , of cards .",
    "this stack contains all the data for the experiment .",
    "we may have more complicated ways of recording data onto cards .",
    "a useful example is where we record @xmath175 onto the cards where @xmath176 represents some observations we do not want to regard as part of @xmath129 which we make immediately before implementing the action @xmath159 . in this case",
    "we can have @xmath177 .",
    "we may wish to condition @xmath172 at @xmath129 on some data collected previously \" at @xmath178 .",
    "for example we might want to have @xmath179 where @xmath180 is data recorded at @xmath178 .",
    "however , since we do not want to assume we have fixed causal structure , it is a matter of the physical dynamics as to whether data recorded at @xmath178 will be available at @xmath129 . therefore it makes no sense to allow this functional dependence .",
    "rather , any such dependence must be implemented physically .",
    "for example , @xmath176 could be equal to the retarded value of @xmath180 seen at @xmath129",
    ". then we can write @xmath177 .",
    "it is possible that some cards in the stack will be repeated .",
    "this could happen for example if the clocks in the second example above were faulty and sometimes ticked out the same value twice . to get round this we replace repeated cards by a new card having the same data plus the multiplicity appended to @xmath160 .",
    "after each run of the experiment we will have a _ stack _ of cards which we denote by @xmath174 .",
    "we can bundle these together and attach a tag to this bundle specifying @xmath172 .",
    "this can be repeated many times for each possible @xmath172 .",
    "we imagine that all these tagged bundles are sent to a man in a sealed room who analyzes them ( see fig.[sealedrm ] ) .",
    "the man can not look outside the sealed room for extra clues .",
    "hence , all concepts must be defined in terms of the cards themselves .",
    "the point of this story is that it enforces a particular kind of honesty .",
    "the man is not able to introduce what einstein called factitious causes \" @xcite such as an unobservable global inertial reference frame since he is forced to work with the cards .",
    "the order of the cards in any particular stack does not , in itself , constitute recorded data and is of no significance . likewise",

    "the best way to see this is as follows . given a causaloid for @xmath151 ( we could consider it for @xmath320 , or @xmath181 instead ) we can imagine that we have collected data @xmath513 in region @xmath514 . we can regard this new data as conditioning , like @xmath198 , for a new causaloid in @xmath515 . let us call this new causaloid @xmath516 .",

    "we can see that this type of reconditionalization will not change the pattern of links .",

    "thus , when we speak of causal structure \" we do not necessarily intend to imply that we have well defined causal structure of the type that allows us to determine whether two nodes are separated by a time - like or a space - like interval .",
    "the causaloid can be thought of as containing all potential causal structures .",
    "the particular causal structure that gets manifested depends on what data is collected and even after data has been collected it may not be useful or even possible to say retrospectively that two regions were time - like or space - like separated .",
    "general relativity is , ultimately an empirical theory concerning data and so it should be possible to put it in the framework here or one very similar to it .",
    "however , as things stand , there are a number of obstacles .",
    "general relativity is based on a space - time continuum whereas the structure we have described , being based on actual data , is discrete .",
    "there are various approaches we could take to dealing with this .",
    "first , we could attempt to find a continuous version of the causaloid formalism .",
    "this would involve taking limits to pass from a discrete to a continuous structure .",
    "alternatively , we could use a discrete version of gr such as the regge calculus @xcite ( for other discrete approaches see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since our ultimate objective is to formulate a theory of qg which is likely to be discrete and then show that gr emerges as a limiting case we might well be satisfied with a discrete version of gr .",
    "we will discuss issues pertaining to the continuum in a the next section .",
    "general relativity is deterministic . if general relativity had an external time we could use cprobt and form probabilistic mixtures of pure states .",
    "cprobt is well defined and so this would be a fairly straight forward matter .",
    "deterministic gr would then simply correspond to the evolution of pure states in this framework .",
    "however , since we do not have external time this option is not open to us .",
    "rather we have to exploit the causaloid structure .",
    "despite the fact that a theory of quantum gravity would require us to address the issue of probabilities in the context of gr , there appears to be very little work in this area .",
    "one issue is that in gr we tend to find a solution for a whole space - time whereas probabilities are often understood in the context of a repeatable situation .",
    "even if we could create many copies of the universe , we have can only have access to data from one copy .",
    "this issue , at least , can be addressed ( see sec .  [ universalc ] ) .",
    "we have introduced the notion of agency .",
    "we allow the possibility of alternative actions - such as the setting of knobs .",
    "agency is actually a very common notion in physics . in newtonian physics",
    "we speak of forces being applied . in quantum theory",
    "we think of performing different measurements . in both classical and quantum physics",
    ", we can remove the need for agency by , for example , including a full description of the agents in the hamiltonian .",
    "even so , we might ask whether we can really understand physical theories without some notion of agency .",
    "an equation in physics tells us what would happen were various counterfactual possibilities realized . in quantum theory",
    "the notion of agency is especially entrenched .",
    "the quantum state is , one might argue , best understood as a list of probabilities pertaining to incompatible measurements - that is pertaining to different possible actions - and is therefore difficult to interpret without agency .",
    "the notion of agency is not naturally incorporated into einstein s field equations .",
    "however , we could attempt to incorporate it by interpreting the eventual effects of tiny differences in @xmath147 well below the experimental resolution we are working to as corresponding to different choices of an agent .",
    "for example , whether a knob is set in one position or another depends on tiny differences in the brain of the experimentalist .",
    "a special case is where there is only ever one choice of action . and",
    "consequently no - agency is a special case of agency .",
    "this means , at least formally , there is no problem of putting gr into an agency based framework .",
    "however , if do not have active agency we lose something potentially quite important .",
    "the notion of causal structure is best understood from an agency point of view .",
    "thus , we can ask whether measurement outcomes in one location depend on what action is implemented in another location . we can not employ this understanding of causality if we do not have an active notion of agency .    in gr coordinates , @xmath0 ,",
    "are usually understood to be abstract .",
    "if follows from the principle of general covariance that , having found a solution @xmath520 on some manifold @xmath149 , the correct description of nature is given by forming the equivalence class over all diffeomorphisms of that manifold ( smooth mappings of the points in @xmath149 onto itself ) .",
    "the abstract coordinates , @xmath0 , themselves have no physical meaning .",
    "however , the @xmath129 which appears on the cards in the causaloid formalism is an actual observation and must be read off an actual physical system . in one sense",
    "this is better .",
    "the cards have actual data on them and , in this sense , must correspond to observables . in some sense",
    "we are ( from the point of view of gr ) already working with diffeomorphism invariant objects .",
    "however , this leaves the problem of how to put gr in the causaloid formalism .",
    "one approach to this problem is to attempt to introduce actual physical coordinates into gr .",
    "einstein , in a semi - popular account of gr @xcite , spoke of a reference - mollusc `` as a way of giving physical meaning to the abstract coordinates .",
    "thus he imagined many small clocks attached to a non - rigid reference body such that infinitesimally displaced clocks have readings that are infinitesimally close ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we could consider many different molluscs .",
    "einstein then states the general principle of relativity requires that all these molluscs can be used as reference - bodies with equal right and equal success in the formulation of the general laws . ''",
    "another physical reference frame is provided by the fact that the universe is , at a fine grained level , highly non - isotropic and inhomogeneous .",
    "therefore the view from each point is different .",
    "this provides a way of physically labelling each space - time point ( or at least each small region ) .",
    "a modern version of a physical reference frame is the gps system .",
    "any space - time point could be labelled with the retarded times received from four appropriately positioned clocks .",
    "rovelli has considered how one might go about measuring the metric using such a gps system @xcite .",
    "general relativity has the property , in common with other pre - quantum physical theories , that it is fairly harmless to consider counterfactuals .",
    "thus , even if there is no reference mollusc , we can consider , counterfactually , what would have happened if there had been one .",
    "rather than having @xmath147 we have @xmath521 .",
    "if @xmath522 is sufficiently small compared to @xmath147 then the two solutions of einstein s field equations will differ very little .",
    "hence , we can draw empirical conclusions about the solution with no mollusc by looking at the solution with a mollusc . in quantum theory",
    "such counterfactuals are notoriously more tricky .",
    "two solutions differing only in a single photon can be quite radically different . a successful attempt to find a theory of qg should embrace rather than shy away from this issue .",
    "newton invented differential calculus for the purpose of understanding the motion of particles .",
    "in doing so he considered a ratio @xmath523 and took the limit as @xmath524 .",
    "there are two ways we might understand this limit .",
    "we might imagine that time is ontologically continuous and so it makes sense to consider smaller and smaller time intervals .",
    "alternatively , we might take an operational approach .",
    "thus , we might imagine that there is no limit to how accurately we can measure @xmath525 and @xmath526 .",
    "if we take an operational approach then we know that there is certainly a practical limit to how accurately we can measure these intervals and , furthermore , there may be limits in principle .    in practice rather than directly measuring @xmath525 and @xmath526 to some incredible precision",
    "we often perform a measurement over a much longer time and extrapolate back to get a value of @xmath523 .",
    "for example , we may deduce the transverse velocity of a particle emerging from a hole in a card from the position , @xmath527 , it hits a screen placed at some distance .",
    "we will have some model of the motion of the particles which will allow this deduction .",
    "tiny differences in this transverse velocity will correspond to big differences in @xmath527 . and",
    "this is really the key point .",
    "the reason we want to imagine that we have a well defined ratio @xmath523 is that , even though it is essentially impossible to measure it as defined , our models predict that tiny differences in the ratio correspond to big differences at later times .",
    "there is a danger that the quantity @xmath528 only derives it meaning from the model and this process of extrapolation and that it does not actually have either the ontological or operational meaning we allot to it .",
    "even though very small differences in @xmath523 may not be measurable , the much bigger differences in @xmath527 at the screen are .",
    "ideally we would like a calculus which is not based on quantities that are not directly measurable ( and may have no meaning ) but is still predictively useful .",
    "how are we to account for the measurable differences in @xmath527 other than in terms of small differences in some quantity @xmath523 we can not measure ?",
    "in fact , in developing the causaloid formalism , we have already given an answer to this .",
    "we developed the notion of fiducial measurements .",
    "thus , though we might be able to measure a large set of quantities , it is only necessary to measure a small fiducial set to deduce all the others .",
    "thus , rather than relating @xmath527 to a quantity that can not actually be measured , we can simply relate it to other quantities like @xmath527 which can actually be measured .",
    "the causaloid formalism gives a consistent way of doing this ( though for probabilities ) .",
    "for example , we might imagine that we can apply various fields to particles emerging from the hole , place the screen at various distances , and so on .",
    "we would like to know the position the particle is detected on the screen for all these various things we might do .",
    "these various positions will be related and the causaloid formalism provides the appropriate mathematical machinery for relating them .",
    "one reason we seek to define quantities like @xmath523 is that we want to know the state at a given time @xmath23 .",
    "the usual notion of state at time @xmath23 \" is that it pertains to some ontological state of affairs at time @xmath23 which can be measured , in principle , at time @xmath23 or at least within some short time @xmath23 to @xmath529 .",
    "but it is not necessary that nature admits such notions at a fundamental level . and",
    ", even if nature does not admit these notions , we will still be able to do empirical science using the causaloid formalism . in the causaloid formalism the basic object , @xmath530 , is built out of lambda matrices .",
    "these matrices pertain to operationally defined elementary regions at the level of experimental apparatuses .",
    "we can use the causaloid to give meaning to the state at time @xmath23 by choosing a foliation as in ( [ foliation ] ) .",
    "the state at time @xmath23 is @xmath531 where @xmath348 contains everything of interest that comes after time @xmath23 . the fiducial measurements @xmath355 are in @xmath348 .",
    "a stronger constraint would be to demand that the fiducial measurements actually fall in @xmath532 .",
    "that is we might demand that it be possible to establish the state at time @xmath23 by measurements carried out during the small time interval @xmath23 to @xmath347 .",
    "this requirement , or something like it , would seem to be a feature of all current physical theories . however , there is no reason to demand it in principle .",
    "if we drop this constraint then move beyond the type of situation envisaged by newton where the state at time @xmath23 is specified by quantities measurable in principle during the time interval @xmath23 to @xmath533 .",
    "thus , we see that the causaloid formalism provides us with a new calculus capable of dealing with situations where newton s differential calculus would be inappropriate .",
    "the advantage of differential calculus and the implied ontology is that , where it works , it affords a simple picture of reality which allows significant symmetries to be applied .",
    "we can hope that increased familiarity with the causaloid approach may achieve something similar .    in classical physics , including gr ,",
    "the distinction between ontological notions of space and time and the operational support for them is not an important one .",
    "there are no fundamental limitations coming from classical theories on how small apparatuses which might measure @xmath525 and @xmath526 can be . in qt",
    "the situation is a little more subtle .",
    "qt as applied to say systems of atoms does predict a scale which suggests a limit on how small apparatuses might be .",
    "however , we can imagine that there are other fields which can probe nature on a smaller scale and there is no limit coming from qt as to how small this scale might be . in these cases",
    "we can always imagine in principle probing on much smaller scales than the characteristic scales of the physics being considered .",
    "it is only when we get to qg that we hit in principle limits to our ability to probe nature directly at smaller and smaller scales .",
    "any instrument used to probe at these small scales will necessarily have mass and energy . as @xmath525 and @xmath526 become smaller the associated energy and momentum will lead to black hole formation .",
    "this happens at the planck scale .",
    "thus in qg we expect for the first time a clear break down in our ability to give operational support for ontological notions of continuous time and space ( see also @xcite )",
    ". we should be wary of introducing ontological notions which are not backed up , at least in principle , by operational procedures since we risk introducing factitious elements into our theory .",
    "hence , in qg we expect that we will have to use a different calculus .",
    "the causaloid calculus provides a way forward here .",
    "the formulation of probgr is likely to be useful in formulating qg .",
    "however , it is worth noting that this likely operational breakdown of the continuum distinguishes qg from probgr and constitutes an extra problem that we must deal with .",
    "it is often stated that experiments to test a theory of qg will involve probing nature at the planck scale .",
    "it is no coincidence that apparatuses we might construct to do this would have to be very big .",
    "as illustrated above , postulated variation at a small scale shows up at a large scale and we might even doubt that there is any ontological meaning to talking about what is happening on this small scale .",
    "the fiducial measurements in the causaloid formulation for such an experiment will , we expect , be at a much larger scale than the planck scale .",
    "in the causaloid framework the lambda matrices that make up the causaloid tell us everything . in a formulation of",
    "gr they must therefore replace both @xmath144 and @xmath147 . in this respect",
    "it is interesting to note that the two roles of @xmath144 pointed out in sec .",
    "[ remarksgr ] have analogues in the causaloid formalism .",
    "thus , the local lambda matrices tell us about local physics as does the value of @xmath144 at a point , and the composite system lambda matrices tell us about how elementary regions become correlated as does the connection @xmath148 ( which depends on the local variation of @xmath144 ) .",
    "there are two approaches we could take to formulating gr in the causaloid framework .",
    "first we could attempt to put a discrete version of gr ( such as the regge calculus ) in the framework .",
    "secondly , we could attempt to rederive gr from scratch in this new framework perhaps by imitating appropriate aspects of einstein s original derivation of gr .",
    "the second approach is likely to be more fundamental though the first approach may help us gain important insights .",
    "data is collected on cards and is typically of the form @xmath158 .",
    "we can think of @xmath129 as playing two roles .",
    "first , it provides a label that differentiates the elementary regions and second , it provides a local orientation in four - dimensional space - time .",
    "the action @xmath159 will typically have some direction associated with it .",
    "thus , we might measure the spin along a certain axis .",
    "if we want think relativistically we should use a four vector @xmath534 to describe this measurement ( this being measured relative to the local orientation provided by @xmath129 ) . similarly the outcome @xmath160 will also have a direction and should be denoted with a four vector @xmath535 .",
    "the measurement @xmath536 would therefore be associated with two four - vectors .",
    "it is reasonable , therefore , to suppose that a fiducial set is given just be taking such measurements associated with the sixteen components ( as happens in tensorial analysis ) .",
    "thus , we can select a subset of all measurements where @xmath159 and @xmath160 are orientated along the @xmath537 and @xmath538 directions respectively .",
    "this will lead to fiducial measurements @xmath539 . for each @xmath540",
    "there will be many such @xmath244 s corresponding to each possible value of @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "the situation may be more complicated since @xmath159 and @xmath160 may have more @xmath537-type labels .",
    "motivated by the discussion in sec.[introdspace ] we could attempt to formalize this by saying that in each elementary region @xmath6 there exist fields @xmath541 where @xmath542 with @xmath543 using suggestive notation we could have fields @xmath144 and @xmath147 .",
    "we would then have local lambda matrices @xmath544 and composite system matrices @xmath545 where we use @xmath546 and @xmath547 to label the precompression elements in the product omega sets .",
    "we can form similar objects for composite systems composed of more than two elementary regions . since we do not have fixed causal structure we do not expect the methods of sec .  [ introdspace ] to work .",
    "if these initial steps are correct then the problem of formulating both gr and qg in this framework is to find the corresponding causaloids .    in general relativity",
    ", the principle of general covariance requires that the form of the laws , expressed as equations between tensorial objects , is invariant under general coordinate transformations . we could attempt to do something similar in the causaloid formalism .",
    "thus , let us imagine that the causaloid is determined by solving some equations .",
    "then there are two levels at which we could demand something like general covariance .",
    "first , at a general level .",
    "we can write down the causaloid with respect to an arbitrary set of omega sets for each region @xmath185 .",
    "we could require that the equations which determine the causaloid take the same form for any choice of omega sets .",
    "second , and less generally , we could just require that these equations are invariant under general transformations of the coordinates @xmath548 which induces a transformation @xmath549 of the local fiducial measurements , which , in turn , induces a transformation @xmath550 in the local omega sets .",
    "at least in the case of gr we should seek a way to implement the principle of equivalence .",
    "as a first stab at this we might require that there always exists a coordinate transformation inducing a transformation to local omega sets @xmath551 such that the local lambda matrices predict special relativistic physics in @xmath6 .",
    "however , since we are in a probabilistic context we have to admit the possibility that we have uncertainty as to what this local frame is .",
    "a sufficiently precise measurement in @xmath6 should be able to establish what the set of local inertial frames is for each field @xmath446 .",
    "we can let this measurement be associated with a set of measurement vectors @xmath552 where @xmath144 labels the local inertial frames which leave @xmath144 in minkowski form .",
    "the equivalence principle requires that the fields are correlated so that , when there is certainty as to what the local inertial frame is for each field , there is agreement .",
    "thus , @xmath553 this should work in gr .",
    "however , in qg we expect to get pure states which are superpositions of other pure states .",
    "thus , if we have @xmath554 and @xmath555 each of which agrees with special relativistic physics but with different @xmath144 , then we expect other pure states corresponding to some sort of superposition of these for which there is no transformation to special relativistic physics .",
    "the implementation of the equivalence principle in qg would therefore seem to require a preferred basis with respect to which it holds .",
    "if we are successful in formulating gr ( actually probgr ) in the causaloid framework we can then attempt to formulate qg .",
    "it is quite likely that some of the differences between probgr and qg mirror the differences between cprobt and qt and this might give us a strong handle on how to obtain qg from probgr .",
    "there are two key differences between cprobt and qt .",
    "first , in cprobt we have @xmath58 whereas in qt we have @xmath120 ( in the sense discussed in sec .",
    "[ qtpostulates ] ) .",
    "thus , if we are to build up a complete set of fiducial measurements in qg it is likely that we will want to add extra measurements to those gr . in fact",
    "the situation is a little more complicated for the causaloid than it was in sec .",
    "[ qtpostulates ] .",
    "since the preparation for the elementary region @xmath6 is both to the future and the past ( and the sides ) of @xmath6 it is the transformation matrices which map linearly to the @xmath14 vectors and hence , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ classcausaloid ] , we have @xmath556 in cprobt and @xmath557 in qt . to get from to qt from cprobt we need to add two new fiducial @xmath14 s for each pair of fiducial measurements in cprobt .",
    "the second key difference is that qt has a continuous set of reversible transformations whereas cprobt has only a discrete set .",
    "this has the effect of filling out the space of pure states in qt . in qt",
    "we have unitary transformations .",
    "this is unlikely to survive in qg since we do not have a fixed background to evolve the state with respect to .",
    "thus , information about the state is likely to leak out into the degrees of freedom which represent our frame of reference .",
    "for a transformation to be reversible on the other hand we require that no information about the state leaks out .",
    "however , we may have something which very well approximates reversible unitary transformation for sufficiently small regions of space time .    in the above discussion we used @xmath144 and @xmath147 .",
    "however , operational quantities would be better than these .",
    "operational quantities would involve the meeting of test particles , the behaviour of rays of light , and so on @xcite .",
    "we have defined a few notions of causaloid : ( i ) the causaloid for a predictively well defined region @xmath151 ; ( ii ) the open causaloid ; and ( iii ) the causaloid for the whole pack @xmath181 ( this may not actually exist ) .",
    "we now wish to introduce a further notion - the universal causaloid .",
    "the motivation for this is to remove the need for repeatability .",
    "we repeat an experiment many times and bundle the cards from each run together forming a stack .",
    "the fact that we are able to bundle the cards separately indicates that , actually , there is some additional marker which could constitute recorded data that distinguishes the cards from one run to the next .",
    "for example , in the case of the probes floating in space illustrated in fig .",
    "[ probes ] we reset the clocks and take note of the fact that we have done this .",
    "all this is rather artificial .",
    "why should we bundle our data into stacks coming from different repetitions of an experiment ?",
    "it would , one might imagine , be more natural simply to collect one big stack of data which might or might not be regarded as coming from repetitions of an experiment .",
    "the problem with this is that it is unclear how we might interpret probabilities .",
    "the following approach seems reasonable .",
    "associated with any proposition @xmath558 concerning the data that might be collected is some vector @xmath559 . in testing the data to see whether @xmath558 is true we will be testing its truth among a complete set of mutually exclusive propositions @xmath560",
    "we define @xmath561 .",
    "we will say that @xmath558 is true if @xmath562 we use the symbol @xmath563 because we can never expect experimental data to give absolute support for a proposition .",
    "we can decide in advance just how exactly equal we require these two vectors to be .    to illustrate how this can apply to the case of probabilities consider the vectors @xmath564 pertaining to in the disjoint regions @xmath565 for @xmath566 to @xmath53 where @xmath53 is big .",
    "further , define @xmath567 we define @xmath568 .",
    "now assume that @xmath569 for all @xmath56 .",
    "we see that @xmath570 is like @xmath310 and @xmath571 is like @xmath311 of sec.[cpredictions ] . in our previous language",
    "we would say that this means that the probability of @xmath572 in @xmath573 given see @xmath574 in @xmath575 and we perform procedure @xmath576 in @xmath577 is @xmath302 .",
    "but we can turn this into a statement in the form of ( [ raapproxrai ] ) .",
    "thus , consider @xmath578 this is the vector corresponding to the property that @xmath579 out of the @xmath53 regions @xmath577 have outcome @xmath580 to within @xmath581 .",
    "we also have @xmath582 using ( [ rpri ] ) we obtain @xmath583 \\right ) { \\bf r}_a^i\\ ] ] from the theory of binomial distributions we have @xmath584 \\approx 1 - o({1}/[\\delta p{\\sqrt{n}]})\\ ] ] hence , if @xmath53 is sufficiently large , condition ( [ raapproxrai ] ) is satisfied and we can say that the proposition is true .",
    "this means that we do not need to make repeatability intrinsic to the definition of the causaloid .",
    "rather , we can simply define a universal causaloid so that we can look for properties that are true ( to within some small error ) .",

    "the approach outlined in this paper aims at finding a framework for a theory of qg . as such",
    ", it is quite possible that other approaches to qg will fit within this framework .",
    "however , there are two key aspects of the causaloid framework which should be compared with other approaches .    1",
    ".   we deal with data that may be collected in actual experiments .",
    "the approach here is top down `` rather than bottom up '' .",
    "all other approaches to qg start with some ideas about the structure of space and time at very small scales ( usually the planck scale ) and then attempt to build up .",
    "the causaloid formalism is more general than quantum theory . we can attempt to treat qt and gr in an even handed way rather than requiring gr to fit fully in the framework of qt .",
    "most other approaches to qg take the basic form of qt unchanged .",
    "the two main approaches to qg are string theory @xcite and quantum loop gravity @xcite though there are other approaches .",
    "string theory assumes a fixed non - dynamical background space - time and attempts to obtain a perturbative version of quantum gravity ( along with the other fundamental forces ) .",
    "it is difficult to see how , when we go beyond the pertubative domain , this approach could have truly dynamic causal structure as it must .",
    "the basic picture appears to be that of unitary evolution in standard quantum theory .",
    "thus , string theory fits in the usual quantum framework .",
    "quantum loop gravity is canonical approach .",
    "a canonical formulation of gr is quantized .",
    "thus , it is fundamentally a @xmath593 approach and this appears to be the conceptual origin of some of the mathematical problems faced by the program . in treating space and time on a different footing we break the elegance of einstein s fundamentally covariant approach ( this seems to be ok for canonical qg if we adopt the newton - cartan approach where @xmath594 and we have natural @xmath593 splitting @xcite ) . rather than forcing gr into a canonical framework it seems more natural to require that qt be put in a manifestly covariant framework .",
    "this appears to be problematic since the notion of a state across space evolving in time is basic to the usual formulation of qt .",
    "however , the causaloid framework allows us to go to a more fundamental formalism in which we do not have a state evolving in time .",
    "a new approach emerging from the theory of quantum loop gravity is the spin - foam approach ( see @xcite for a short review ) . in this approach",
    "spin - foams represent four dimensional histories in space time .",
    "the evolution between two times is represented by an amplitude weighted sum over such spin - foams . in this approach",
    "we see graphs dressed with matrices .",
    "however , the causaloid diagrams are quite different since they are fixed for a given theory .",
    "the notion of a history is clearly better than that of a state at a given time so far as providing a manifestly covariant formulation is concerned .",
    "however , a history is a rather big thing .",
    "it involves all possible events between the two times of interest . the causaloid formalism deals with matrices between elementary regions .",
    "in the case that there exist rules we may only need to specify local lambda matrices and lambda matrices for pairs of regions ( as in qt ) .",
    "this is closer to einstein s original approach than providing an amplitude for an entire history is .",
    "another approach is the causal set approach of sorkin @xcite . in this approach",
    "the fundamental notion is of points with causal relations between them .",
    "causal sets are taken to obey certain axioms so that they form partially ordered sets .",
    "these sets are represented by a graph with nodes joined by links .",
    "the partially ordered sets of the causal set approach are actually very different to the causaloid for various reasons .",
    "first , these partially ordered sets are supposed to provide a picture of space - time at the planck scale .",
    "second , the links are not dressed with matrices and so causal relationship between the points is not as rich as that between elementary regions in the causaloid formalism . and",
    "third , a given causal set is meant to provide one possible history ( rather like a spin - foam ) whereas the causaloid is a fixed object ( though one which contains a way of calculating probabilities for all histories ) .",
    "a more recent approach is due to lloyd @xcite .",
    "he suggests that quantum gravity should be modelled by a quantum computation . in so doing he is able to implement dynamic causal structure .",
    "however , since the whole process is embedded in standard unitary quantum theory , there is still a background time .",
    "another approach is non - commutative geometry pioneered by connes @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that operators like @xmath595 , @xmath596 , and @xmath597 , at a point do not commute .",
    "this appears to fit within the framework of qt as we have defined it ( since we said nothing about commutation relations ) . in standard qt the operators @xmath598 and @xmath599 will commute by virtue of the way the tensor product is defined . in the causaloid formalism",
    "the analogous objects will not , in general , commute if @xmath295 is replaced by @xmath600 . in this sense",
    "there may be a connection between the causaloid formalism and non - commutative geometry .",
    "one problem which is common to most approaches which start with a planck scale picture is that it is difficult to account for the four dimensional appearance of our world at a macroscopic level ( smolin calls this the inverse problem \" @xcite ) .",
    "since the approach in this paper starts at the macroscopic level , it may allow us to circumvent this problem in the same way einstein does in gr .",
    "thus , we would not attempt to prove that space - time is four dimensional at the macroscopic level but put this in by hand .",
    "this is not an option in planck scale approaches to qg because the constraint that a four dimensional world emerges at the macroscopic scale has no obvious expression at the plank scale .",
    "the best approach , however , may be to combine an approach which posits some properties at a planck scale with the causaloid approach . by working in both directions",
    "we might hope to constrain the theory in enough different ways that it becomes unique .",
    "we have developed a framework for probabilistic theories which allow dynamic causal structure .",
    "central to this is an object called the causaloid .",
    "this object is theory specific and we have calculated the causaloid for classical probability theory and quantum theory .",
    "we have not calculated it for gr though we presented some preliminary ideas .",
    "the results in this paper suggest the following program for finding a theory of qg .    1",
    ".   formulate probabilistic general relativity ( probgr ) in the causaloid framework .",
    "this will involve finding rules to calculate the causaloid from a basic set of lambda matrices 2 .",

    "a particular issue we will have to pay attention to is that in probgr we have continuous space - time whereas we do not expect to be able to give operational support to this notion in qg .",
    "this may force us to be more radical in the construction of qg than is suggested by the above three steps .",
    "the causaloid formalism contains some elements in common with the aharonov , bergmann , and lebowitz ( abl ) time - symmetric formulation of qt @xcite .",
    "indeed , it may even be regarded as a radical generalization of the abl formulation .",
    "the abl approach has led to a number of fascinating results where naive reasoning leads to counterintuitive though correct results .",
    "for example , if a particle is tunnelling through a potential barrier then , when it is in the forbidden \" region , one might naively reason that its kinetic energy ( total energy minus potential energy ) is negative ( even though it should always be positive ) .",
    "it turns out @xcite that a certain type of measurement of the kinetic energy ( called a _ weak measurement _ ) will actually give negative readings if the state of the particle is preselected in its half evolved state and postselected in the forbidden region ( using the abl approach ) .",
    "the causaloid formalism might be expected to put such counterintuitive properties in an even more general setting and this may contribute to our understanding of them .",
    "the approach taken here attempts to combine the early operational philosophy of einstein as applied to gr with the operationalism of bohr as applied to qt ( see @xcite for a discussion of how einstein and bohr might have engaged in a more constructive debate ) .",
    "we do this primarily for methodological reasons to obtain a mathematical framework which might be suitable for a theory of qg without committing ourselves to operationalism as a philosophy of physics .",
