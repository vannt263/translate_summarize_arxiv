    "their association with the coupled process of accretion has been obstructed by the long dynamical timescales associated with these objects .",
    "how matter falling at high speed toward a black hole manages to escape to the external universe remains a mystery   that can only be solved by studying the coupled processes of inflow and outflow .",
    "the key to this puzzle seems to lie with binary systems in our own galaxy , which harbor stellar - mass ( 515 m@xmath0 ) black holes that  we are just beginning to appreciate  seem to display the same kind of inflow : outflow coupling as agn but on timescales typically six to eight orders of magnitude shorter in proportion to m. thus ,",
    "although agn are the powerhouses of the universe , it is their nearby cousins , which vary rapidly enough that humans may follow the changes in the disc - jet coupling , to which we turn for an understanding of the relation between accretion and jets around black holes .    with the launch of the _ rossi x - ray timing _",

    "its peculiar x - ray properties , coupled with other characteristics in common with other systems , allow us to study in detail the instabilities of the accreting gas .",
    "these instabilities have been positively associated with the ejection of relativistic jets and to related flaring episodes in the radio band .",
    "this means that the interaction of emitted powerful collimated jets can be studied on different timescales and associated with ( near-)simultaneous events in the accretion flow that provides the gas for them .",
    "the uniqueness of grs 1915 + 105 stimulated us to center a full discussion on the disc - jet coupling on this system .",

    "the radio counterpart of grs 1915 + 105 was observed to be variable in flux and spectrum ( see rodrguez & mirabel 1993 ) , and the radio variability was correlated to the hard x - ray flux ( mirabel et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the major breakthrough took place when mirabel & rodrguez ( 1994 ) used the vla radio to observe components moving away from grs 1915 + 105 with apparent superluminal velocity , at the same time estimating a distance of 12.5 kpc ( see rodrguez et al .",

    "( 1997 ) , who identified two spectral states : a hard one with a strong 0.56.0 hz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) , and a soft one with no qpos ( see also paul et al .",
    "1997 ) . in the same year , belloni et al .",
    "( 1997a ) accumulated pca energy spectra from the high - flux and low - flux intervals seen in figure 3 and fitted them with the `` standard '' simplified model for bhcs , consisting of a disc - blackbody component ( see mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) plus a power - law component to account for the high - energy tail .",
    "the free parameters of this model are the flux @xmath2 and photon index @xmath3 of the power - law and the inner radius of the accretion disc @xmath4 and temperature at the inner radius @xmath5 .",
    "the strong and sudden hardening events seen in the hardness curve in figure 3 can then be understood in terms of a hardening ( from @xmath63.6 to @xmath62.2 ) of the power law and a softening ( @xmath7 2.2 to @xmath80.6 kev ) of the disc component . at the same time , the inner - disc radius @xmath4 , which in many sources had been observed to remain constant at a value of a few dozen kilometers ( interpreted as the innermost stable orbit , see tanaka & lewin 1995 ; see below ) was seen to increase from @xmath820 to @xmath8300 km .",
    "the interpretation of these transitions , which happened on a timescale of a few seconds , was that they were due to the onset of a thermal - viscous instability .",
    "in this framework , the sudden increase in @xmath4 corresponded to the inner portion of the accretion disc becoming unobservable in the x - ray band .",
    "the accreting matter passing through @xmath4 would slowly `` refill '' the unobservable region on a viscous timescale , increasing the surface density of the inner portion of the disc until the reverse transition would take place and go back to a fully observable disc . in this interpretation",
    ", it is not necessary that the inner part of the disc is completely emptied of gas , but simply that the gas makes a transition to a much cooler state , which makes it effectively invisible in x - rays .",
    "this picture was subsequently strengthened by the analysis of more observations ( belloni et al .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy allowed the evolution of the spectral parameters to be followed in detail ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "in particular , belloni et al .",
    "( 1997b ) found that in the soft intervals , @xmath4 was approximately constant around 20 km , independent of the length of the interval , whereas in the hard intervals , the radius showed a time evolution .",
    "the maximum radius reached in each hard interval was strongly correlated with the length of the interval @xmath9 ( see figure 5 ) and anticorrelated with the minimum flux reached . in the framework of the instability picture of belloni et al .",
    "( 1997a ) , this has a direct interpretation : the spectral evolution and the duration of the event are determined by one parameter only , namely , the radius of the missing inner section of the accretion disc , i.e. , @xmath4 . for a large radius ,",
    "the drop in flux will be large and the time needed for refill will be long . associating the refill time with the disc viscous timescale @xmath10 at @xmath4 ,",
    "can be expressed as    @xmath11    where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the radius in units of 10@xmath14 cm , @xmath15 is the black hole mass in solar masses , and @xmath16 is the accretion rate in units of 10@xmath17 g / s ( see belloni et al .",
    "from this , under the reasonable assumption that the external @xmath18 does not vary within a one - hour observation , we expect to observe    @xmath19    the line in figure 5 shows a fit of @xmath9 versus @xmath4 with a @xmath20 relation : only the longest interval deviates from the expected relation .",
    "the two quantities @xmath9 and @xmath4 are determined in a completely different fashion , the first from timing analysis and the second from a spectral decomposition , ensuring that the observed correlation is not spurious .",
    "the relation in figure 5 is a direct measurement of the radial dependence of a fundamental quantity of an accretion disc , obtained through the analysis of the variability from a source that is indeed peculiar , but also shows many properties in common with other systems . owing to the approximations in the disc blackbody model",
    ", the measurement of the inner - disc radius can not be considered precise in its absolute value ( see merloni et al . 2000 ) , although large variations , such as those observed in grs 1915 + 105 , can not be due to these approximations . from this observation ,",
    "a one - to - one correlation between the length of an instability interval and the following high - rate interval was found .",
    "yadav et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that indeed in many observations made with the _ ixae _ satellite , the length of the instability interval correlated with the length of the following high - rate interval and not with that of the preceding one .",
    "therefore , the full observed high - low cycles are caused by the onset of the instability , which is not directly influenced by the duration of the `` stable '' interval .",
    "markwardt et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , analyzing in detail a specific _ rxte_/pca observation from 1997 , identified three separate states on the basis of timing and spectral characteristics .",

    "a complete classification of the light curves observed by _",
    "rxte_/pca from grs 1915 + 105 during the first two years of the mission was presented by belloni et al .",
    "the observed light curves were divided into 12 classes ( shown in figure 7 ) on the basis of their timing and color properties .",

    "( 2000 ) concluded that , as suggested by markwardt et al . ( 1999 ) for a single observation , indeed the flux and spectral variability of grs 1915 + 105 can be interpreted as transitions between three separate states .",
    "they called these states a , b , and c. figure 8 shows a schematic view of the three states in terms of their x - ray colors :    * state a : softer spectrum , dominated by a disc component with @xmath21 1 kev",
    ". mostly little time variability .",
    "* state b : softer spectrum , dominated by a disc component with a larger temperature than state a. substantial red - noise variability on timescales @xmath22 1 s. * state c : hard colors , with the spectrum dominated by a relatively flat power - law ( @xmath3=1.82.5 ) .",
    "white noise variability on timescales @xmath221 s.    the transitions between these three states are so far observed only in the directions indicated by arrows in figure 8 , i.e. , no direct c@xmath23b are seen .",
    "these states connect to the instability picture outlined above in the following way : state c corresponds to the onset of the instability in the inner section of the disc , whereas states a and b correspond to stable periods .",
    "this means that the transitions that involve state a are not interpreted within that picture .",
    "the existence of definite events that can not be interpreted in a thermal - viscous instability framework was already pointed out by taam et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who analyzed a _ rxte_/pca observation of class @xmath24 .",
    "they showed that the difference between state a and state b can be associated to a variation in the inner edge of the accretion disc , although of smaller amplitude than that observed during state c. this picture is confirmed by a more complete analysis by migliari & belloni ( 2003 ) .",
    "an analysis of time - resolved spectra from a large number of _",
    "rxte_/pca observations , together with timing analysis , was made by muno et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who presented a number of correlations between spectral parameters and timing parameters .",
    "vilhu & nevalainen ( 1998 ) analyzed observations of class @xmath25 and interpreted through spectral fitting that the regular `` ring '' in the color - color diagram is due to out - of - phase oscillations of different spectral parameters .",
    "a full spectral analysis on a timescale of 16 s of the instability oscillations in class-@xmath26 observations showed that indeed the inner - disc radius estimated from the disc blackbody component is larger during state a than during state b ( migliari & belloni 2003 ) .",
    "moreover , there is evidence for changes in the local accretion rate through the disc during states c and b but not during state a , where inner - disc temperature and radius change in a way that reflects a constant disc accretion rate ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "these results were followed by a series of theoretical papers aimed at a more thorough exploration of the connection with accretion disc models ( szuszkiewicz & miller 1998 , 2001 ; nayakshin et al .",

    "the complexity of the variability observed in grs 1915 + 105 is unique and difficult to model . clearly , it will not be possible to interpret in detail every aspect of the complex light curves shown in figure 7 , yet the structure of these light curves is not random and contains information about the accretion disc of grs 1915 + 105 . as can be seen from different works ( e.g. , belloni 2001 ) , there are complex light curves that repeat almost identically years apart .",
    "although at first sight the x - ray light curves observed from grs 1915 + 105 seem wildly different , the number of repetition patterns observed by _",

    "all the models listed in the previous paragraph are aimed at explaining the single a ",
    "c event and its appearing on different timescales , but the observed sequence of events is complex and by no means random .",
    "this aspect has not been investigated so far .",
    "for instance , naik et al . (",
    "2002 ) found that certain variability classes are observed preferably before and after long c - state intervals ( plateaux , see below ) , indicating a connection between the observed patterns and the long - term behavior , possibly linked to the mass accretion rate .",
    "the issue of timescales deserves particular attention . as we have shown above ,",
    "the length of c - state intervals observed within one pca light curve can vary from a few seconds to half an hour .",
    "however , there are observations when the source is observed only in state c ( defined as class @xmath27 in belloni et al . 2000 ) .",
    "because each observation lasts typically one hour , it is reasonable to hypothesize that these are one - hour segments of longer state - c intervals . in some cases ,",
    "this can be measured directly . from figure 2 ,",
    "one can see intervals of relatively little variability in the daily asm scans ( for instance , around days 200 and 650 ) , corresponding to a higher value of hardness ratio .",
    "these intervals have been called plateaux . in addition , a longer , lower , extended hard state is also visible in figure 2 , lasting more than a year and centered around day 400 .",
    "the color properties of these plateaux have been analyzed by belloni et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who found that their properties are consistent with being long state - c intervals .",

    "a full spectral analysis of the long plateau was presented by trudolyubov et al .",
    "( 1999a ) , whereas trudolyubov ( 2001 ) compared in detail the properties of these three plateaux and found that both spectral and timing characteristics differ between the short plateaux and the long plateaux ( see also belloni et al .",

    "there is no definite answer as yet , although it is widely assumed that the large value of mass accretion rate ( which , depending on the observation and on the spectral model , has been measured even to exceed the eddington luminosity for a 14@xmath30 object ) plays a fundamental role in setting up these instabilities .      in this section ,",

    "the rise and decay profiles are very similar over a broad range in frequencies ( from the radio through the near - ir ) .",

    "the timescales associated with , for example , state transitions and transient jet formation can vary widely ( by factors of at least @xmath91 ) for black holes of ( probably ) very similar masses , so its not obvious how to scale up to smbh , at least until the coupling with other parameters , most likely accretion rate , is understood . nevertheless , marscher et al .

    "the ratio of masses @xmath93 means that events of timescales @xmath92 year in 3c 120 would correspond to timescales of seconds or minutes in grs 1915 + 105 , close to those observed .",
    "note that the observation of these dips being associated with highly relativistic ejections is consistent with the conclusion drawn earlier that the oscillation events are probably associated with large bulk velocities .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the physics of disc - jet coupling in xrbs and agn are very closely linked , and that by studying the nearby xrbs  and grs 1915 + 105 in particular  we may understand the flow of energy to and away from smbh at the centers of galaxies over timescales of millions , or even billions , of years .",
    "on the basis of our detailed studies of grs 1915 + 105 , we can make some progress with our understanding of the coupled accretion : outflow progress in accreting black hole systems .      as discussed above , protracted spells in hard x - ray states",
    "are associated with steady jet formation and long periods in soft states are not .",
    "such observations , also in the context of similar behavior in other x - ray binaries ( fender 2004 and references therein ) have been considered as strong evidence for the association of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) outflows with large scale - height accretion flows ( e.g. , meier 2001 , meier et al .",
    "the hard x - ray component in such states is generally supposed to arise in some form of comptonization ( e.g. , sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 , mcclintock & remillard 2004 ) , in which case a clear connection between the `` base '' of the outflow and this comptonizing corona is required ( see discussions in muno et al .",
    "2001 , zdziarski et al .",
    "2003 , fender 2004 ) .",
    "alternatively , the hard x - ray emission may arise directly in the jet via comptonization ( see discussion in atoyan & aharonian 1999 ) or , more radically , optically thin synchrotron emission ( markoff et al . 2001 , vadawale et al . 2001 ) . in either case ,",
    "a clear coupling between the hot plasma responsible for the hard x - ray emission , including its associated strong x - ray variability , and the production of a jet requires explanation in future models . however , this is only part of the story .",
    "empirically , we can also suggest that hard - to - soft state transitions are associated with resolvable ejection events , but is there a unique signature in the x - ray emission that tells us precisely when this event occurs ?",

    "however , an overriding problem with seeing clearly the disc - jet coupling in grs 1915 + 105 ( despite the many advantages the source offers ) has been that the rise , decay , and recurrence times of the synchrotron events are all comparable . in general , a synchrotron event begins to rise before the previous event is fully decayed , so observing the beginning of the `` flare '' phase is difficult .    by drawing analogies with other x - ray binaries",

    "possibly most , of the more conventional transients , the spectral evolution of the source around the time of the ejection can be tracked more clearly than in grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "what is generally observed is a peak in the ls ( e.g. , brocksopp et al .",
    "2002 , maccarone & coppi 2003 , yu et al .",
    "2003 ) . at this point",
    "the strongest self - absorbed jet is probably being produced .",
    "subsequently , most sources transit to a softer x - ray peak , which corresponds to the vhs / is , and then later to the canonical hs .",
    "it is at the vhs / is peak that the optically thin radio event occurs ; subsequently , the jet is  off  until the return to a harder x - ray state . applying the knowledge we have gained from these other transients to grs 1915 + 105 , we assert that the optically thin ejection event occurs at the state c @xmath94 state a transition .",
    "the power associated with the strongest steady jets ( those around the ls peak in the x - ray light curve ) and the subsequent optically thin events seems to be remarkably close .",
    "we can demonstrate this in the following .",
    "fender , gallo & jonker ( 2003 ) have presented a simple formula for estimating the power in a jet in the ls of an x - ray binary :    @xmath95    where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the powers in eddington units in the jet / outflow and radiation from the accretion flow ( primarily x - rays ) , respectively .",
    "the value of the constant is estimated as @xmath98 .",
    "note that malzac , merloni & fabian ( 2004 ) have suggested that all low - state sources are jet - dominated , in which the value of the normalization is much larger : @xmath99 .",
    "fender , belloni & gallo ( 2004b ) have further compiled estimates of the power associated with optically thin ejection events as a function of the corresponding peak ( vhs / is ) x - ray luminosity and found a function of the form    @xmath100    where the exponent @xmath101 results from a fit to multiple independent estimates .",
    "these power estimates are made assuming equipartition on the basis of observations of rise times and luminosities of radio events ( see fender et al .",
    "2004b for more details ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the estimates for the steady jets , which are based on broadband spectra and estimates of radiative efficiency ( fender et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) or models for the production of correlated optical and x - ray variability ( malzac et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the normalization for the transients jets , @xmath102 ( with a large uncertainty , probably as much as an order of magnitude larger or smaller ) , is directly comparable to the normalization @xmath103 estimated for the steady jets above ( assuming no significant advection of accretion energy in either case ) . given the completely independent methods used to estimate the jet power in the two regimes , it is remarkable that the exponents of the two functions are the same within uncertainties . in the event that the estimate for @xmath103 of malzac et al .",
    "( 2004 ) is closer to reality than the lower limit given in fender et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , then the normalizations are also very close . from this",
    "we draw the conclusion that the power associated with the strongest self - absorbed jet , and that associated with the subsequent optically thin flare , are comparable ( within an order of magnitude or so ) .",
    "this strongly suggests a rather smooth function in the relation between jet power and x - ray luminosity , and not two completely independent mechanisms for powering the two types of jet .    as noted in gallo et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and hinted at for grs 1915 + 105 ( see above ) , it seems that the velocity of the steady jets is also lower than that associated with the optically thin ejection events .",
    "this is based on the fact that the spread around a common @xmath104 relation for all black hole xrbs in the ls requires @xmath105 ( for a random distribution of viewing angles ) , otherwise doppler boosting would result in a larger scatter .",
    "fender et al .",
    "( 2004b ) have refined this fit and compiled multiple pieces of evidence that the lorentz factor associated with the optically thin ejections of transient xrbs is @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , although we do not know the form of the function ( e.g. , it could be step - like or continuous ) , it seems clear that the transient jets have larger bulk lorentz factors than the steady jets .      in the following ,",
    "we attempt to construct a semi - quantitative model for the radio emission in grs 1915 + 105 that is hopefully relevant to other x - ray binaries and to agn . in order to lay the foundations for this model ,",
    "we summarize some of the key physical indicators :    * prolonged `` hard '' x - ray states ( e.g. , canonical ls , grs 1915 + 105 state c ) are associated with steady production of self - absorbed jets . * prolonged `` soft '' x - ray states ( e.g. , canonical hs , grs 1915 + 105 states a and b ) are associated with a suppression of jet production . * during the transition between hard and soft x - ray states , an optically thin ejection event occurs . in the canonical definitions of states ,",
    "this event occurs at the vhs / is peak , close to the end of a phase of x - ray spectral softening .",
    "this corresponds to a transition from state c to state a in grs 1915 + 105 ( the c to b channel is not observed ; see figure 8) .",
    "* the transient jets associated with these events have significantly larger bulk lorentz factors than those associated with the steady jets .",
    "based on these observational results , we have arrived at the following semi - quantitative picture of the evolution of the disc - jet coupling during x - ray binary outbursts in general , and those of grs 1915 + 105 in particular . the picture is summarized in figure 27 ( see color insert ) , and in the text below .    the upper panel in figure 27 is a hardness - intensity diagram for the x - ray emission from a given source .",
    "the canonical ls and hs correspond to nearly vertical strips at the extreme right ( hard ) and left ( soft ) of the panel , respectively .",
    "practically the entire range in hardness between these two canonical states represents vhs / is of varying hardness .",
    "we suggest that above a certain hardness ( phases i and ii ) a jet is produced whose strength correlates with that of the x - rays in the nonlinear way found by corbel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and gallo , fender & pooley ( 2003 ) .",
    "below that hardness ( phase iv ) a jet is not produced ; these two regimes correspond to the regions right and left of the vertical line in figure 27 , respectively .",
    "we propose that as a source spectrum softens and it approaches the line from the right , the velocity of the jet increases monotonically . at first , this increase is insignificant for the energetics of the outflow , which is not highly relativistic ( bulk lorentz factor @xmath107 ) .",
    "however , around the time that the source crosses the line ( phase iii ) , which generally corresponds to a peak in the soft x - ray flux , the jet velocity increases very rapidly ( @xmath108 ) before the jet is shut off .",
    "such a rapid increase in jet velocity would produce a shock in the preexisting , slower - moving , jet , which would manifest itself in an optically thin flare with large bulk motions .",
    "for most x - ray binaries , an outburst follows a path similar to that indicated by the solid arrows in figure 27 .",
    "the `` quiescent '' state of such sources can be found by extending the ls branch vertically downward .",
    "often , sources will exhibit a few secondary flaring states in the same outburst , associated with further optically thin radio flares ( e.g. , gro j1655 - 40 , xte j1550 - 564 , xte j1859 + 226see , e.g. , brocksopp et al .",
    "2001 , homan et al .",
    "2001 ) , but these are usually of declining strength .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the model of vadawale et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , this declining sequence may be naturally explained by the first event having considerably more material in front of it with which to interact ( because there was a long phase of steady jet production in the `` quiescent '' state and ls ) . in any case , grs 1915 + 105 seems to remain , for most of the time , very close to the dividing line between jet - producing states and states without jets .",
    "the radio  mm  ir  x - ray `` oscillation '' events ( e.g. , figures 3 , 13 , 21 , and 23 ) for which grs 1915 + 105 is so famous may be compared to the encircled region in the upper - left of the diagram , with the direction of a typical oscillation being indicated by the dahsed arrow . in this picture ,",
    "grs 1915 + 105 is repeatedly entering the jet - producing state then crossing the dividing line to jet - free states . each transition from right to left is associated with an optically thin event ; those from left to right are not . sometimes grs 1915 + 105",
    "remains in the hard state ( state c ) for considerably longer and may extend across the upper branch toward the canonical ls .",
    "however , the transition from this state inevitably involves crossing the line from right to left once more , producing a major flare event .",
    "this model should be considered as a synthesis of previous observational results and theoretical interpretations ( although any errors resulting from the synthesis are entirely ours ! ) .",
    "mirabel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) first suggested the idea that the x - ray `` spike '' at the end of hard `` dips '' might correspond to the moment of jet production .",
    "we have expanded on this to show that in other x - ray binaries it is the ( secondary ) vhs / is peak and not the ( initial ) ls peak that corresponds to the optically thin radio flare .",
    "meier ( 1999 ) discussed a dramtically ( discontinuously ) varying jet speed in response to varying conditions in the accretion flow .",
    "the internal - shock model based on varying flow speeds in a semicontinuous jet was originally developed for the jets of the agn m87 ( rees 1978 ) , and later considered for gamma - ray bursts ( rees & meszaros 1994 ) and generically for radio - loud quasars ( spada et al .",
    "kaiser et al . ( 2000 ) considered internal shock models for grs 1915 + 105 and vadawale et al .",
    "( 2003 ) explicitly considered `` post - plateau flares '' as resulting from shocks generated by fast moving ejecta interacting with a slower - moving outflow produced during the plateau .",
    "esimates of the jet power in steady and transient phases are more recent ( corbel et al .",
    "2003 ; gallo et al . 2003 ; fender et al .",
    "2003 , 2004b ) , as is the certainty that the transient jets are considerably more relativistic than the steady jets ( gallo et al .",
    "2003 , fender et al .",
    "2004b ) .",
    "the model as it stands is mainly phenomenological , but there are some clues to the underlying physics .",
    "for example , the jet velocity seems to increase as the optically thin accretion disc moves ever closer to the central accreting object , only becoming significantly relativistic in the very final stages .",
    "this may naturally reflect the escape velocity of matter from the inner edge of the accretion disc , which will remain almost constant until it enters regions of significant spacetime curvature within a few gravitational radii of the black hole ( but see fender et al .",
    "2004a , where a highly relativistic jet from a neutron star is in contradiction with the `` escape velocity '' scenario ) .",
    "this is consistent with the evolution of the x - ray colors , but what exactly happens at this point ?",
    "it could be that the soft state , for some reason ( e.g. , no significant vertical magnetic field or extreme compton cooling of relativistic electrons ) , inhibits jet formation , and that the optically thin flare was a last gasp from the jet before it is suppressed .",
    "on the other hand , it may be that the sudden increase in jet velocity / power is enough to force the accretion flow to settle into a different state , in which case the state change is a result of , not a cause of , the radio ejection event .",
    "the similarity of the formulae for the power associated with the two types of jet may argue for a common underlying mechanism , which is simply the release of gravitational potential in the accretion flow .",
    "alternatively , the boost in the jet velocity , and possibly power , for the very smallest disc radii may be in response to a sudden additional contribution from the black hole spin .    finally , what makes grs 1915 + 105 so special ? as noted above , the evolution of outbursts from other x - ray transients typically follow the path of the solid lines in figure 27 .",
    "although some ( see , e.g. , homan et al . 2001 , brocksopp et al . 2002 ) may make a small number of repeated phase iii transitions , resulting in several ejection events , they have all returned to relative obscurity within a year or so .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 has , on the contrary , been very luminous and active for @xmath109 years .",
    "it seems clear that its unusual behavior is a result of a very high ( at times probably super - eddington ) accretion rate being maintained for a very long time , probably as a consequence of binary evolution ( the orbital period of grs 1915 + 105 is exceptionally long for an x - ray transient ) . in this sense , it is comparable to the brightest quasars among the sample of agn .",
    "in this review , we discuss at length the observational properties of grs 1915 + 105 in the x - ray , ir , and radio bands one decade after the discovery of highly relativistic jets from the source , the first in our galaxy . a connection between the x - rays and the longer - wavelength ( ir and radio ) emission in this source is unambiguous , and as a result it has become one of the key systems for our understanding of the disc - jet coupling . placing the system into context",
    ", we have argued that its properties are not that dissimilar from the x - ray states observed in other black hole binaries . beyond this , the relation of disc - jet coupling in x - ray binaries to that in agn is now finally on a quantitative footing , and we can be confident that insights drawn from grs 1915 + 105 will be relevant for the disc - jet connection around black holes of all masses .",
    "consequently we have proposed a toy model for the disc - jet coupling in grs 1915 + 105heavily inspired by other , earlier works  that requires a minimum ( i.e. , one ) different mode of jet formation and , we hope , is consistent with the picture for other black hole systems .",
