    "recent experiments have demonstrated an impressive level of control over micro- and nanomechanical oscillators .",
    "one key achievement is the engineering of mechanical modes with extremely low dissipation , providing remarkable isolation from the environment @xcite .",
    "a second cornerstone is the detection and manipulation of micro- and nanomechanical motion .",
    "both in solid - state based systems @xcite and cavity optomechanical settings @xcite , techniques have been perfected to monitor position fluctuations with an imprecision down to the standard quantum limit @xcite . moreover ,",
    "sophisticated techniques for cooling and coherent excitation of individual mechanical modes have been developed @xcite , providing access to the quantum ground state @xcite .    in the light of these achievements ,",
    "mechanical oscillators appear as promising systems for the study of quantum physics .",
    "the motivation is manifold .",
    "firstly , manipulations on the quantum level represent the ultimate control over a system .",
    "practically , this would have implications for the achievable sensitivity e.g.  in force sensing @xcite , gravitational wave sensing @xcite , or nuclear spin imaging @xcite .",
    "secondly , quantum control over massive objects could enable new tests of non - standard decoherence theories @xcite and illucidate the crossover from microscopic quantum systems to macroscopic classical systems .",
    "finally , mechanical oscillators coherently coupled to other well - controlled quantum systems are examples of _ hybrid quantum systems _ , which are of interest in the context of quantum engineering , quantum information networking , and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the different systems that are investigated have specific advantages and drawbacks .",
    "optomechanical systems so far mostly realize a linear coupling of mechanical motion to a coherently excited optical cavity mode . in this limit",
    ", the coupling can be very strong , and e.g.  a mechanical analog of the autler - townes splitting in the energy spectrum of a coupled resonator - cavity system was observed @xcite ( similarly in an electromechanical system @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical proposals have shown that the coupled system could generate mechanical squeezing @xcite , entanglement between the light field and the resonator @xcite , or schrdinger cat states of the light field @xcite .",
    "however , the creation of mechanical fock states or more general quantum superpositions is not possible by a linear coupling to a classical field .",
    "different approaches have been developed to overcome this limitation .",
    "for example , dispersive measurements that rely on a quadratic coupling to the light field could permit the observation of quantum jumps between fock states @xcite .",
    "alternatively , non - classical light states such as single photon states could be employed to generate superpositions of position states @xcite . yet",
    ", single photons lead only to a minute coupling , and enhancement of the interaction by additional classical fields is required to achieve strong coupling with current experimental parameters @xcite .",
    "a promising way to achieve full quantum control of a mechanical oscillator is to couple it to another well - controlled quantum system , preferably a two - level system .",
    "solid - state two - level systems are very attractive in this context , and a variety of scenarios has been discussed @xcite .",
    "mechanical systems have already been successfully coupled to a single electron spin in a solid @xcite or to a cooper pair box @xcite , and the recent demonstration of quantum control of a mechanical oscillator coupled to a superconducting qubit @xcite has set the pace in the field .",
    "the latter experiment displays the advantages of entirely solid - state based approaches , being in essence a high coupling rate and a natural compatibility with cryogenic environments . yet , the coherence times of solid - state based two - level systems as used so far reside in the nanosecond to microsecond regime , which leads to the requirement of an exceptionally high coupling rate in the mhz range and consequently also very high mechanical resonance frequencies .",
    "furthermore , the mechanical oscillator is typically integrated into a complex electronic environment and carries electrodes , making it difficult to independently optimize the mechanical quality factor .",
    "coupling ultracold atoms to mechanical oscillators creates a novel , qualitatively different setting .",
    "both optically or magnetically trapped clouds of ultracold atoms as well as trapped ions represent systems where quantum control has been achieved over all degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "one of their outstanding features is the possibility to achieve exceptionally long coherence times .",
    "superpositions of internal states have been demonstrated to preserve coherence for several seconds @xcite .",
    "remarkably , for neutral atoms this is still true in close proximity to chip surfaces @xcite .",
    "in addition , an elaborate toolbox for the quantum manipulation of the atomic state is at hand @xcite , offering control over internal and motional degrees of freedom .",
    "atoms can be regarded as mechanical oscillators themselves .",
    "acting as a dispersive medium inside an optical cavity , an interesting variant of dispersive cavity optomechanics can be realized @xcite .",
    "atoms provide both the continuous degree of freedom of collective atomic motion as well as a discrete set of internal levels that can be reduced to a two - level system .",
    "furthermore , a unique feature of ultracold atoms is that dissipation can be tuned , e.g.  by switching on / off laser cooling @xcite , and that self - interactions can be tuned and used for the generation of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the challenge in the present context is to find a suitable coupling mechanism that provides controlled and sufficiently strong interactions of the atoms with a single mechanical mode of a micro- or nanostructured oscillator .      in this article",
    "we discuss different approaches to engineer a coupling between atomic systems and micro- and nanomechanical oscillators .",
    "we focus initially on the most straightforward approach , the direct mechanical coupling of the oscillator s motion to the motion of trapped atoms .",
    "the coupling results from a force that depends on the distance between the two systems , such that the force gradient converts an oscillation of the position of one system into a modulation of the force experienced by the other .",
    "energy can be coherently exchanged when both systems oscillate with about the same frequency , i.e. for ( near-)resonance conditions .",
    "to realize a direct mechanical coupling , it has been suggested to use electrostatic forces to couple to trapped ions @xcite or polar molecules @xcite . with neutral atoms ,",
    "a first experiment was already performed @xcite , exploiting attractive surface forces between a micromechanical oscillator and a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , see sec .",
    "[ sec : surfacecoupling ] .",
    "a beneficial variant of this approach is to use the mechanical oscillator as an integral part of the trap itself , either as an electrode of an ion trap @xcite , current carrying wire of a magnetic trap @xcite , or as a mirror generating a one - dimensional optical lattice @xcite .",
    "we discuss the direct mechanical coupling in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : directcoupling ] , where we show that the large mass difference between a single atom or ion and a micro- or nanostructured mechanical oscillator results in an impedance mismatch that limits the coupling to rather small values .",
    "we point out that the coupling can not be simply increased beyond a certain level by increasing the strength of the coupling force , because a significant distortion of the atom trap would result .",
    "however , one can think of several promising strategies to enhance the coupling , and we present them in the context of specific implementations in the subsequent chapters .",
    "we first discuss the possibility to compensate the trap deformation in order to achieve stronger coupling in the case of an ion trap ( sec .",
    "[ sec : ioncoupling ] ) .",
    "second , a way to minimize the impedance mismatch is to use molecular - scale oscillators with low mass .",
    "we discuss this perspective for surface - force coupling between a bec and a carbon nanotube ( sec .",
    "[ sec : cntcoupling ] ) .",
    "alternatively , one can increase the effective mass of the atoms by using a large number of them .",
    "such collective enhancement is a promising route to achieve strong coupling mediated by an optical lattice ( sec .",
    "[ sec : latticecoupling ] ) .    for the perspective of creating a coupled quantum system where the mechanical oscillator is `` macroscopic '' ,",
    "it is highly desirable to find coupling mechanisms where the impedance mismatch does not play a role .",
    "indeed this is possible in several schemes : a powerful method is to use a high - finesse optical cavity that incorporates both the mechanical oscillator and the atoms , such that the two systems are coupled via the intracavity light field .",
    "possible schemes rely either on a dispersive optomechanical coupling @xcite or on resonant interaction @xcite .",
    "we discuss one particular scenario of this kind @xcite ( sec .",
    "[ sec : cavitycoupling ] ) , where strong coupling may be achievable even for a single atom and a rather massive membrane oscillator .",
    "coupling the oscillator motion to the internal degrees of freedom of atoms is another way to avoid the impedance mismatch .",
    "this can be achieved by a magnet on the oscillator tip which transduces the mechanical motion into magnetic field oscillations , thereby establishing a coupling to the atomic magnetic moment @xcite .",
    "we discuss this scheme in sec .",
    "[ sec : magneticcoupling ] .",
    "it could be used for quantum state tomography of the mechanical oscillator via an atom @xcite , enable the generation of entanglement between two nanomechanical oscillators @xcite , and it could be scaled up by the use of atoms in an optical lattice coupling to an array of oscillators @xcite .",
    "magnetic coupling was the first mechanism that was studied experimentally , using an atomic gas in a vapor cell @xcite .",
    "we note that magnetic coupling is also considered for the coupling of mechanical oscillators to color centers in diamond @xcite . finally , the mechanical oscillator could also act on the polarization state of light , which then couples to internal states of atoms @xcite .",
    "the remarkable feature of this scheme is that long - distance entanglement between the mechanical oscillator and the atoms can be created by means of a projective measurement even for a thermal oscillator .",
    "let us consider a system of two harmonic oscillators of different mass that are coupled by a spring .",
    "this is a general model for various proposed methods to directly couple the motion of trapped atoms or ions to the vibrations of a mechanical oscillator via a distance - dependent force .",
    "it allows us to make general statements about the achievable coupling strength . for simplicity",

    "there , the question about the mechanical quality factor of the atom arises . since levitated systems such as ultracold atoms have no direct contact with the environment , there are only minute damping mechanisms present ( e.g. the friction caused by collisions with the background gas , by resistive damping of moving mirror charges in an ion trap , or by damping of induced currents from moving paramagnetic atoms ) .",
    "larger effects on the motion come from trap anharmonicity and residual heating due to noise in the structures generating the trap ( fluctuating currents , voltages , magnetization ) . in particular , slow drifts of trap parameters lead to drifts of the resonance frequency and cause dephasing .",
    "while experiments with collective motion of ultracold atoms have achieved quality factors @xmath72 @xcite limited by the atomic trap lifetime and rather low trap frequencies , trapped ions can achieve @xmath73 in cryogenic penning traps @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath74 is in many cases not the relevant parameter , and particularly in the context of quantum engineering , the decoherence rate @xmath75 is the key figure of merit . in ion traps , nonclassical motional states with coherence lifetimes up to @xmath76  ms have been reported @xcite . for neutral atoms , nontrivial motional quantum states have been studied in optical lattices by populating excited lattice bands @xcite , and in magnetic microtraps in the context of trapped atom interferometers @xcite , where decoherence lifetimes up to 200  ms have been demonstrated @xcite .",

    "it is particularly severe in the presence of low coupling rates .",
    "strategies to increase the coupling beyond the values given above are thus highly desired .      a natural way to increase",

    "[ sec : directcoupling ] . to mitigate distortion ,",
    "two compensation magnets can be placed next to the coupling magnet with identical direction of magnetization .",
    "this reduces the static field gradient at the location of the atoms , while the oscillatory field @xmath252 remains unaffected as the compensation magnets do not oscillate .",
    "it was already demonstrated @xcite that preparation of arbitrary quantum states in a harmonic oscillator can be achieved by a switchable , linear coupling to a two - level system with the law - eberly protocol @xcite . in the present scheme ,",
    "a single atom is an effective two - level system if other transitions are sufficiently detuned .",
    "this can be achieved intrinsically via the quadratic zeeman effect , or controllably via state - selective microwave dressing @xcite .",
    "transitions between two states @xmath264 and @xmath265 of the atom can be described by creation and annihilation operators @xmath266 and @xmath267 , and with the linear coupling to the mechanical oscillator , the system is analog to the well - known jaynes - cummings model described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath268 where @xmath269 is the single - atom single - phonon coupling constant for the state pair @xmath270 . in the field of cavity qed , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hjc ] ) usually describes the coupling of an atom to the electromagnetic field of a single mode of an optical or microwave cavity @xcite . here , it describes the coupling to the phonon field of a single mode of mechanical oscillations . in this sense , this is a mechanical cavity qed system . in the case of an ensemble of atoms coupling collectively to the oscillator",
    ", the description is given by the tavis - cummings model @xcite .",
    "this system can achieve the strong coupling regime both for a single atom and for a small cloud of atoms .",
    "a single @xmath247 atom trapped at a distance @xmath271 nm from a cantilever with @xmath272 m and @xmath273mhz carrying a single domain co nanomagnet of dimensions @xmath274 nm achieves a coupling rate @xmath275hz .",
    "the expected decoherence rate of the atoms depends strongly on the involved magnetic levels . for coherence times on the order of seconds , magnetic sublevels with identical ( @xmath276 ) or vanishing ( @xmath277 ) magnetic moment",
    "have to be used @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : magcoupschem ] c. the latter state pair also avoids trap distortion due to the coupling magnet , but it requires an optical or electrodynamical trap to hold the atom @xcite . to connect states in different hyperfine manifolds ,",
    "a two - photon process is required with an additional strong microwave field at @xmath278 .",
    "if the parameters are adjusted properly , the two - photon coupling reduces the effective coupling rate only by a factor of @xmath279 . a sufficiently low decoherence rate of the cantilever to achieve the strong coupling condition @xmath280 again requires a low bath temperature @xmath82mk and a very high quality factor @xmath83 .",
    "similar to the previous discussion for the nanotube in sec .",
    "[ sec : cntcoupling ] , cryogenic ground state cooling of the cantilever is not available .",
    "further cooling could be achieved by a state swap with a bec of @xmath87 atoms collectively coupled to the oscillator .",
    "excitations of the oscillator can be coherently transferred to the atoms prepared in state @xmath281 , such that after an interaction time @xmath282 the oscillator is in a state with reduced mean phonon number . alternatively , by making use of atomic transitions between the two hyperfine manifolds @xmath283 and @xmath284 with a transition frequency @xmath285ghz , one could employ ghz mechanical oscillators , for which cryogenic ground state cooling can be achieved @xcite .",
    "based on the magnetic coupling mechanism described above , a scalable experimental setup was proposed in @xcite , where the atoms are trapped in an optical lattice and each lattice site couples to an individual mechanical oscillator .",
    "this could be used for atomic state manipulation with single lattice site resolution , for the operation of quantum gates , or for the entanglement of distant mechanical oscillators @xcite .",
    "a magnetic interaction was also used in the first experiment that demonstrated a coupling between a mechanical oscillator and an atomic system @xcite . there , a microfabricated cantilever with a magnetic tip was excited to coherent motion and coupled to a gas of rb atoms in a vapor cell .",
    "the oscillating magnetic field of the tip causes spin precession of the atoms , which can be detected as an intensity modulation of a detection laser .",
    "this scheme can serve for magnetic field sensing , and a sensitivity of @xmath286nt@xmath287 was demonstrated .",
    "finally , magnetic interactions can also be used to couple a mechanical oscillator to a solid - state `` artificial atom '' such as a nitrogen - vacancy center ( nv ) in diamond @xcite .",
    "the advantage compared to ultracold trapped atoms is that a large coupling strength @xmath288khz can be achieved because the distance between the magnetic tip and the nv center can be made very small ( @xmath289 nm ) and distortion of trapping potentials is not an issue . to compete with the typically faster decoherence of the nv ground states ,",
    "level dressing was proposed to tune the coupled system to a sweet spot with strongly suppressed magnetic field sensitivity and thus reduced decoherence rate , sufficient to achieve the strong coupling regime @xcite .",
    "ultracold atoms coupled to mechanical oscillators represent a novel type of hybrid mechanical system that can benefit from the exceptional coherence properties and the versatile techniques for quantum manipulation of trapped atoms .",
    "this could enable readout , cooling , and coherent manipulation of mechanical systems via the well - developed tools of atomic physics .",
    "a multifaceted set of theoretical proposals shows that several different approaches have the potential to achieve strong coherent coupling between atoms and micro- or nanostructured oscillators .",
    "the central challenge is that the overall dynamics of the system is relatively slow , so that exceptional coherence properties of the mechanical oscillator are required .",
    "however , in light of the recent experimental progress with high - quality mechanical oscillators at low temperatures it seems feasible that this challenge can be met .    experimental work on coupled atom - oscillator systems is still at an early stage , but first experiments have already demonstrated different coupling mechanisms @xcite . moreover , some of the proposed schemes can be implemented with moderate technical effort @xcite and enable the observation of backaction of the atoms onto the mechanical oscillator already in room temperature setups .",
    "coupling schemes based on high - finesse optical cavities promise access to a regime of strong coherent coupling with state - of - the - art experimental parameters @xcite , and thus offer a realistic perspective for experiments on the quantum physics of massive mechanical objects .",
