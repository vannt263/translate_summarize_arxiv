    "the gluck twisting operation  @xcite has been regarded as a potential method to produce an exotic @xmath5 ( cf .",
    "this is the operation of removing an embedded @xmath6 from a 4-manifold and regluing it via the non - trivial diffeomorphism of @xmath7 . in @xcite by gluck twisting operation , an exotic pair of non - orientable 4-manifolds was constructed . on the other hand ,",
    "many families of knotted @xmath1-spheres do not change @xmath5 by gluck twisting ( e.g.   @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , no exotic pair of orientable 4-manifolds , which are related each other by gluck twist , known to exits .",

    "[ intro : thm ] let @xmath4 be any compact connected smooth @xmath0-manifold , and @xmath2 be a smoothly embedded @xmath1-sphere with trivial normal bundle .",

    "note that this theorem is the best possible result about gluck twisting odd manifolds .",
    "this is because @xcite implies that one can get an example of a @xmath1-sphere in an odd manifold @xmath2 , where gluck twisting @xmath4 along @xmath3 can change its diffeomorphism type ( consequently @xmath13 does not have any odd spherical class ) .",
    "note that the orientibility is not part of the hypothesis of our theorem .",
    "also note that the condition of having a spherical class in @xmath14 with odd self intersection is equivalent to having a class of odd self intersection in the cohomology group @xmath15 with coefficients , where @xmath16 is the group ring @xmath17 $ ] , since @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the universal cover , and @xmath20 cohomology with compact support .",

    "note that this is a plug twist along @xmath33 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this operation in fact describes the gluck twist :     along @xmath3,width=336 ]    [ gluck_diagram ] the resulting @xmath0-manifold is diffeomorphic to the gluck twist @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath4 has boundary , then we may assume that the diffeomorphism is the identity on the boundary .",
    "one can easily see that the above operation is removing @xmath8 and regluing it via a self - diffeomorphism ( say @xmath34 ) of @xmath7 . a theorem of gluck @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) on the diffeotopy group of @xmath7 implies that , we only need to check @xmath34 does not extend to a self - homeomorphism of @xmath6 .",
    "this can be seen by applying the above procedure to the standard handle decomposition of @xmath35 and @xmath36 : the resulting manifold @xmath37 is not homeomorphic to @xmath35 .",

    "we may assume that @xmath45 is an immersion by homotopy .",
    "furthermore , we may assume that the image of @xmath45 is contained in @xmath47 , since the cocore of a 3-handle is codimention 3 .",
    "let @xmath48 be the transverse intersection points of @xmath49 and the cocores of 2-handles of @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath50 @xmath51 be a small 2-disk neighborhoods of @xmath52 in @xmath53 .",
    "we may assume that each @xmath54 is a core of a 2-handle of @xmath40 and that @xmath55 is contained in @xmath46 . for each @xmath56",

    "we can isotope @xmath45 so that each @xmath62 is contained in @xmath63 .",
    "now we obtain a 2-handle of @xmath40 whose attaching circle is @xmath64 , by introducing canceling 2- and 3-handle pairs and sliding 2-handles along the band @xmath65 s .",

    "hence this attaching circle is null - homotopic in @xmath46 .",
    "we next prove the main theorem .",
    "let @xmath68 be the attaching circle of the handle representing the spherical homology class of @xmath12 with odd self intersection . according to the above lemma , we can assume @xmath68 is a null homotopic loop in the codimension zero submanifold @xmath69 of @xmath12 consisting of its @xmath30- and @xmath70-handles .",
    "hence after ( self crossing ) clasp moves @xmath68 can be made to be an unknot . in paricular ,",
    "if there is another handle represented by a small circle @xmath71 linking @xmath68 with zero framing , then by sliding @xmath68 over @xmath71 we can make @xmath68 an unknotted circle as shown in figure  [ figa1 ] .      having this observation in mind , let us perform the gluck twisting operation to @xmath4 along @xmath3 as shown in figure  [ figa2 ] .",
    "now by sliding the middle @xmath70-framed handle over @xmath68 , we get a 2-handle @xmath72 with even framing . by using the above observation",
