    "einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) successfully describes gravitational physics in the solar system .",
    "its predictions have passed a wide variey of precision experimental tests carried out in weak - field and slow - motion regime with natural bodies and artificial satellites @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these tests include the measurement and verification of ( quoted in terms of relative experimental uncertainty ) : mercury s perihelion advance at 10@xmath0 level through planetary radar ranging @xcite ; the redshift of spectral lines of a hydrogen - maser frequency standard at 10@xmath1 level performed with the gravity probe a spacecraft @xcite ; the deflection of light by solar gravity via very - long - baseline ( radio ) interferometry at 10@xmath1 level @xcite ; the time - delay by gravitational potential using the viking spacecrafts at mars @xcite and the cassini mission at saturn ( the latter at 10@xmath2 level @xcite ) ; the equivalence principle at 10@xmath3 level and the geodetic precession at about six parts in 10@xmath0 with lunar laser ranging ( llr ) of the apollo and lunokhod retroreflectors @xcite ; frame dragging with satellite laser ranging ( slr ) of the lageos satellites and with the gravity probe b ( gpb ) mission ( the former at 10@xmath4 level @xcite ) ; the latter is also expected to yield a very accurate measurement of the geodetic precession .",
    "the first three measurements above ( perihelion precession , gravitational redshift and light deflection ) are the three _ classical tests _ originally proposed by einstein to verify his theory .",
    "the geodetic precession is a relativistic three - body effect that was predicted @xcite by de sitter in 1916 and observed in 1988 by i.i .",
    "shapiro et al . with an accuracy of 2%",
    "using llr data @xcite .    in the effort of improving the experimental measurements and of possibly discovering new physics ,",
    "several extensions and modifications of gr have been developed .",
    "one notable attempt is the parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) formalism , whose verification has been the object of continuous and always improving experimental tests .",
    "no deviation from gr has been found so far .",
    "however , in presence of new physics beyond gr , it is natural to expect and try to measure modifications of the solar system observables described above , which historically marked the transition from newtonian physics to relativistic gravity .    in this paper",
    "we treat the modification of gr to include spacetime torsion and motion along autoparallel orbits .",
    "then we use the measured moon geodetic precession and mercury s perihelion advance to test our predictions . in a companion paper @xcite , we show how the constraints on torsion provided by the measurement of the geodetic precession can be used also to constrain spacetime torsion with the frame dragging experiments on lageos satellites .    in the near future , improvements of the limits reported in these two papers may be obtained from the analysis of mercury radar ranging ( mrr ) data taken since 1990 @xcite , from the relentless analysis of more llr data from more ground stations , from the mm - level range precision provided by the new apollo station at apache point , usa @xcite ( operational since 2007 ) and from the release of the geodetic precession measurement by the gpb collaboration . in the mid - term",
    "we expect a substantial advance from llr with the deployment of 2@xmath5 generation laser retroreflector payloads with robotic soft - landings on the moon , like the missions of the international lunar network ( iln ) , or similar geophysical network , and like jaxa s selene-2 .",
    "we also expect that in the long term , more stringent limits can be set with the approved bepicolombo mercury orbiter , an esa cornerstone mission .",
    "an interesting generalization of gr includes a non - vanishing torsion .",
    "a class of theories allowing the presence of torsion is based on the extension of riemann spacetime to riemann - cartan spacetime .",
    "the latter has a richer geometric structure , since it is endowed with a metric @xmath6 and a connection @xmath7 which is not the levi - civita connection .",
    "a compatibility condition between @xmath6 and @xmath7 is required , namely the covariant derivative of the metric tensor must vanish identically . under this assumption",
    "the resulting connection turns out to be non - symmetric , and such a lack of symmetry gives origin to a non - vanishing torsion tensor .",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite for the details .    in most torsion theories of gravity ,",
    "the source of torsion is the intrinsic spin of matter @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a recent review on searches for the role of spin and polarization in gravity can be found in @xcite .",
    "since the spins of elementary particles in macroscopic matter are usually oriented in a random way , such theories predict a negligible amount of torsion generated by massive bodies . as a consequence spacetime torsion",
    "would be observationally negligible in the solar system .",
    "however , in @xcite mao , tegmark , guth and cabi ( mtgc ) argue that , if there are theories giving rise to detectable torsion in the solar system , they should be tested experimentally .",
    "for this reason , in @xcite a theory - independent framework based on symmetry arguments is developed , and it is determined by a set of parameters describing the torsion and the metric . here , by theory - independent framework , we mean the following : the metric and the connection are parametrized , around a massive body , with the help of symmetry arguments , without reference to a torsion model based on a specific lagrangian ( or even on specific field equations ) .",
    "this framework can be used to constrain the above mentioned parameters from solar system experiments . in particular , mtgc suggest that gpb is an appropriate experiment for this task . in @xcite",
    "the authors compute the precession of gyroscopes and find the constraints that gpb is able to place on the torsion parameters",
    ". in hehl and obukhov argue that measuring torsion requires intrinsic spin , and criticize the approach of mtgc , since gpb gyroscopes do not carry uncompensated elementary particle spin .",
    "mtgc address also the question whether there exists a specific gravitational lagrangian which yields a torsion signal detectable by the gpb experiment . as an example they quote the theory by hayashi and shirafuji ( hs ) in @xcite where a massive body generates a torsion field .",
    "in such a theory gravitational forces are due entirely to spacetime torsion and not to curvature .",
    "the same property is shared by teleparallel theories @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "then mtgc propose what they call the einstein - hayashi - shirafuji ( ehs ) lagrangian , which is a linear interpolation of gr and hs lagrangians .",
    "the main feature of the ehs theory is that it admits both curvature and torsion .",
    "the ehs model has been criticized by various authors .",
    "flanagan and rosenthal show in @xcite that the linearized ehs theory becomes consistent only if the parameters in the lagrangian satisfy suitable relations that , in turn , make the predictions coinciding with those of gr . in the paper @xcite , puetzfeld and obukhov derive the equations of motion in the framework of metric - affine gravity theories , which includes the hs theory , and show that only test bodies with microstructure ( such as spin ) can couple to torsion .",
    "the conclusion is that the ehs theory does not yield a torsion signal detectable for gpb .",
    "for this reason , in @xcite the ehs lagrangian is proposed just as a pedagogical toy model . in the present paper",
    "we will not treat the ehs model .",
    "as also remarked by flanagan and rosenthal in @xcite , the failure of constructing the specific ehs lagrangian does not rule out the possibility that there may exist other torsion theories which could be usefully constrained by solar system experiments .",
    "such torsion models should fit in the above mentioned theory - independent framework , similarly to a parametrized post - newtonian framework including torsion .",
    "we remark that the parametrized formalism of mtgc does not take into account the intrinsic spin of matter as a possible source of torsion , and in this sense it can not be a general torsion framework . however , it is adequate for the description of torsion around macroscopic massive bodies in the solar system , such as planets , being the intrinsic spin negligible when averaged over such bodies .    for this reason",
    "we think it is worthwhile to continue the investigation of observable effects in the solar system of nonstandard torsion models within the mtgc parametrized formalism , under suitable working assumptions .",
    "in particular , our aim is to extend the gpb gyroscopes computations made in @xcite to the case of motion of planets and satellites .    in the present paper",
    "we compute , as an effect of spacetime torsion , the corrections both to the precession of the pericenter of a body orbiting around a central mass , and to the orbital geodetic precession .",
    "we describe the torsion by means of three parameters @xmath8 .",
    "our computations show that a complete account of the precessions requires a parametrization of torsion up to an approximation order higher than the one considered in @xcite .",
    "we consider the motion of a test body in a spherically symmetric field , and the motion of a satellite ( either the moon or lageos ) in the gravitational field of the sun and the earth .",
    "since we use a parametrized framework without specifying the coupling of torsion to matter , we can not derive the equations of motion of test bodies from the gravitational field equations .",
    "therefore , in order to compute effects of torsion on the orbits of planets and satellites , we will work out the implications of the assumption that the trajectory of a test body is either an autoparallel curve or a geodesic .",
    "such trajectories do not need to coincide when torsion is present .",
    "the computations will be carried out under the assumption of weak field and slow motion of the test body .",
    "we will assume that the motion of the satellite is obtained by superimposing the fields of the sun and the earth , both computed as if these bodies were at rest .",
    "observe that these assumptions are satisfied to a sufficient order of approximation in classical general relativity .",
    "as in the original paper of de sitter @xcite , we characterize the motion using the orbital elements of the osculating ellipse . in terms of these orbital elements ,",
    "the equations of motion then reduce to the lagrangian planetary equations .",
    "we calculate the secular variations of the longitude @xmath9 of the node and of the longitude @xmath10 of the pericenter of the satellite .",
    "the computed secular variations show how the corrections to the orbital de sitter effect depend on the torsion parameters @xmath8 .",
    "in addition we calculate the secular variation of the longitude of the pericenter of a body orbiting around a central mass , and also in this case we find the corresponding dependence on @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the data from the llr and mrr measurements are then used to constrain the relevant linear combinations of the torsion parameters .    eventually , we consider the geodesic trajectories , and we find that torsion parameters can not be constrained by solar system experiments .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : spator ] we briefly recall the notion of spacetime with torsion .",
    "in section [ sec : parame ] we recall from @xcite how to parametrize the metric and torsion tensors under the assumption of spherical symmetry , and we extend the parametrization up to a higher order of approximation . in section [ sec : linfullconn ] the connection up to the required order is given . in section [ sec : autopa ] we analyze the equations of autoparallel trajectories and we derive the related system of ordinary differential equations to second order .",
    "the expression of the system clearly reveals the perturbation due to torsion with respect to the de sitter equations . in section",
    "[ sec : comput ] we calculate the correction due to torsion to the precession of pericenter . in section",
    "[ sec : cor ] we calculate the correction due to torsion of the third kepler s law . in section [ sec : geo ] we investigate the motion of a satellite in the gravitational field of the sun and the earth and we compute what we can call the perturbative forces due to torsion . in section [ sec : computorb ] we derive the time evolution of the orbital elements of the satellite , using the classical perturbation theory of celestial mechanics , particularly the gauss form of the lagrange planetary equations . in section",
    "[ sec : corredue ] we calculate the secular variations of the orbital elements of the satellite . in section",
    "[ sec : torbia ] we give multiplicative torsion biases relative to the gr predictions . in section [ sec :",
    "limits ] we report the constraints on the parameters of our torsion model from llr and mrr , which is one of the main goals of this paper . in section [ marrazzosifaprete ]",
    "we analyze shortly the geodesic trajectories . in section [ sec : discu ] we summarize the future prospects of the llr and mrr measurements and we discuss the implications of proposed and approved space missions for the search reported in this paper .",
    "eventually , in the appendix we confirm using a different formalism the computation leading to , and we show that , in the autoparallel scheme , torsion produces an effect on the precession of pericenter which was not taken into account in @xcite .",
    "we briefly recall the basic notions of riemann - cartan spacetimes @xcite , @xcite . a spacetime equipped with a lorentzian metric @xmath6 and a connection @xmath14 compatible with the metric",
    "is called a riemann - cartan spacetime .",
    "compatibility means that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the covariant derivative .",
    "we recall in particular that for any vector field @xmath17 @xmath18 the connection is determined uniquely by @xmath6 and by the torsion tensor @xmath19 as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the levi - civita connection , and @xmath22 is the contortion tensor . in the particular case when @xmath23 is symmetric with respect to @xmath24 the torsion tensor vanishes . in the present paper",
    "we will consider the case of nonsymmetric connections @xmath25 .",
    "the riemann tensor of the connection is given by @xmath26 the particular case of vanishing torsion tensor corresponds to riemann spacetime of gr , while the particular case of vanishing riemann tensor corresponds to the weitzenbck space time @xcite .",
    "throughout this paper we use the natural gravitational units where @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in the following we consider a spherically symmetric body of mass @xmath29 . introducing spherical coordinates @xmath30 , we parametrize",
    "the metric and torsion tensors in a region of space ( out of the body ) where the dimensionless quantity @xmath31 ( i.e. , @xmath32 is large in comparison with the schwarzschild radius of the body ) .",
    "as it will be shown in the sequel , such an approximation is accurate enough for the purpose of our computations and the earth and mercury as test bodies at a distance @xmath32 of the order of their orbit semi - major axes , one gets , respectively , @xmath33 and @xmath34 . ] .",
    "we recall that parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) calculations @xcite show that a complete account of the pericenter precession must involve second order parameters in @xmath35 ( for instance the ppn parameter @xmath36 ) . therefore , assuming spherical symmetry , we parametrize the metric tensor @xmath6 to second order . under the assumption of spherical symmetry",
    "the line element has the following general expression in spherical coordinates : @xmath37.\\ ] ] we can choose @xmath38 , and to second order in @xmath39 we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 are dimensionless parameters .",
    "the metric is then expressed in nonisotropic spherical coordinates . in the computations of trajectories that we will make in the following ,",
    "only the function @xmath42 is required to the second order in @xmath35 , while for @xmath43 the first order approximation is sufficient .",
    "we follow the notation of @xcite for the parametrization of the metric tensor : the parametrization reduces to the first order in @xmath35 to the one used in @xcite . in the case of a ppn metric",
    "we have ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.4.1 ) : @xmath44 in the present paper all the others ppn parameters @xcite are assumed to be negligible .",
    "when spacetime torsion is present , our calculations show that a complete account of the precessions must involve a parametrization of the torsion tensor @xmath45 up to second order in @xmath35 .",
    "we now follow the spherical symmetry arguments used by @xcite : to do this , it is convenient to parametrize the nonvanishing components of the torsion tensor in isotropic rectangular coordinates @xmath46 .",
    "we have @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 are arbitrary dimensionless functions , and @xmath50 is the kronecker s symbol .",
    "if we consider such functions as depending on the dimensionless small quantity @xmath51 , for the purposes of our computations ( see section [ sec : linfullconn ] ) it is sufficient to taylor expand them up to the second order , hence we write @xmath52 where @xmath53 are dimensionless constants . in the particular case of first order approximation ,",
    "the above formulas yield the parametrization used in @xcite . in order to transform to nonisotropic",
    "spherical coordinates in which the metric is expressed , it is convenient to first transform to isotropic spherical coordinates @xmath54 .",
    "we have for the non vanishing components of the torsion tensor @xmath55 we now further transform to nonisotropic spherical coordinates . to the required second order of accuracy , the transformation takes the form @xmath56 with @xmath57 . the resulting expression of the components of the torsion tensor in such coordinates is : @xmath58 the constants @xmath59 and @xmath60 are related to @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 as follows : @xmath65 therefore from and it follows that @xmath66 becomes an explicit function of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and the remaining four parameters involved , @xmath67 since the metric and the torsion are constructed so that the compatibility condition @xmath68 is satisfied , then the metric parameters are independent of the torsion parameters .",

    "the second order of approximation is used in section [ sec : autopa ] for @xmath71 , and in the appendix for @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "it follows that the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath60 ( differently from @xmath75 and @xmath13 ) will not appear in the next sections , and consequently they will not be considered in the sequel of the paper .",
    "the precise form of the equations of motion of bodies in the gravitational field depends on the way the matter couples to the metric and the torsion in the lagrangian ( or in the gravitational field equations ) .",
    "here we consider the parametrized framework of section [ sec : parame ] without specifying a coupling of torsion to matter , hence without specifying the field equations .    in a riemann - cartan spacetime",
    "there are two different classes of curves , autoparallel and geodesic curves , respectively , which reduce to the geodesics of riemann spacetime when torsion is zero @xcite .",
    "autoparallels are curves along which the velocity vector is transported parallel to itself by the connection @xmath76 .",
    "geodesics are curves which are extremals of the length functional , and along which the velocity vector is transported parallel to itself by the levi - civita connection . in gr the two types of trajectories coincide while , in general , they may differ in the presence of torsion .",
    "they are identical when the torsion is totally skew - symmetric @xcite , a special condition which is not satisfied within our parametrization .",
    "the equations of motion of bodies in the gravitational field follow from the field equations , as a consequence of the bianchi identities .",
    "the method of papapetrou @xcite can be used to derive the equations of motion of a test body having internal structure , such as for instance a small extended object that may have either rotational angular momentum or net spin . in standard torsion theories",
    "the trajectories of test bodies with internal structure , in general , are neither autoparallels nor geodesics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , while structureless test bodies , such as spinless test particles , follow geodesic trajectories .    in our computations of orbits of either a planet or a satellite ( considered as a test body )",
    ", we will neglect its internal structure . in a theory - independent framework we can not derive the equations of motion from the gravitational field equations .",
    "therefore we need some working assumptions on the trajectories of structureless test bodies : we will investigate the consequences of the assumption that the trajectories are either autoparallels or geodesics .",
    "assuming the trajectory to be a geodesic is natural and consistent with standard torsion theories .",
    "however , we will see in section [ marrazzosifaprete ] that the geodesics are the same as in the ppn framework .",
    "hence new predictions related to torsion may arise only when considering the autoparallel trajectories , which will turn out to explicitely depend on torsion parameters . in the following we give some motivations which make worthwhile the investigation of autoparallel trajectories .    in the paper @xcite ,",
    "kleinert and pelster argue that the closure failure of parallelograms in the presence of torsion adds an additional term to the geodesics which causes structureless test bodies to follow autoparallel trajectories .",
    "kleinert et al . also argue in @xcite , @xcite that autoparallel trajectories are consistent with the principle of inertia .",
    "hehl and obukhov in criticized the approach of kleinert et al .",
    ", since the equations of autoparallel trajectories have not been derived from the energy - momentum conservation laws .",
    "kleinert investigates this issue in @xcite where the autoparallel trajectories are derived from the gravitational field equations via the bianchi identities , in the case when torsion is derived from a scalar potential ( see @xcite for a discussion of such a kind of torsion ) .    in the papers @xcite , @xcite , using a reformulation of the theory of brans - dicke in terms of a connection with torsion @xcite , dereli , tucker et al .",
    "suggest that the autoparallel trajectory of a spinless test particle is a possibility that has to be taken into account . in @xcite",
    "the results of the investigation of autoparallel trajectories are applied to the computation of the orbit of mercury . in @xcite , @xcite the equations of autoparallel trajectories are derived from the gravitational field equations and bianchi identities , in the special case of matter modeled as a pressureless fluid , and torsion expressed solely in terms of the gradient of the brans - dicke scalar field .",
    "the above mentioned results show that there is an interest in the autoparallels in spacetime with torsion , which make worthwhile their investigation in the present paper .",
    "the system of equations of autoparallel trajectories of a test body reads as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the proper time @xcite .",
    "notice that only the symmetric part @xmath79 of the connection enters in ; in addition , the totally antisymmetric part of @xmath80 can not be measured from .",
    "the trajectory of a test body has to be a time - like curve . since the connection is compatible with the metric the quantity @xmath81 is conserved by parallel transport .",
    "the tangent vector @xmath82 to the trajectory undergoes parallel transport by the connection along the autoparallel .",
    "therefore , an autoparallel that is time - like at one point has this same orientation everywhere , so that the trajectory is strictly contained in the light cone determined by @xmath6 , in a neighbourhood of every of its points",
    ". hence the compatibility of the connection with the metric ensures that autoparallels fulfil a necessary requirement for causality .",
    "the equations ( [ eq : autopara ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath83 for @xmath84 . in our units",
    "@xmath85 and @xmath86 are of the order of @xmath35 .",

    "from the second equation in it follows that if @xmath104 and @xmath105 vanish at one time then @xmath104 is identically zero .",

    "the vector @xmath107 can be decomposed in the standard way along two mutually orthogonal axes as @xmath110 here @xmath111 is the component along the instantaneous radius vector , @xmath112 is the component perpendicular to the instantaneous radius vector in the direction of motion , where @xmath113 is the argument of latitude . then , substituting into gives @xmath114    let us now recall @xcite , @xcite that , using the method of variation of constants , @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the semimajor axis of the satellite orbit , @xmath117 is the eccentricity , @xmath118 is the true anomaly , and @xmath119 @xmath120 , @xmath121 the period of revolution .",

    "formula does not reproduce the ppn result when the torsion parameters vanish , though it reproduces the gr result in the particular case @xmath138 and @xmath102 . in the appendix",
    "we compute the precession of pericenter following the method used in @xcite , obtaining again expression .",
    "the precession of the pericenter in a reformulation of the brans - dicke theory in terms of a connection with torsion has also been computed in @xcite by using autoparallel trajectories .",
