    "the kane model for coupled conduction and valence electrons in narrow - gap bulk semiconductors @xcite was first applied to superlattices three decades ago .",
    "@xcite today this model is still used frequently for the study of medium- and narrow - gap nanostructures .",
    "@xcite kane s theory has a notorious pitfall : spurious solutions with large crystal momentum @xmath1 , which arise from small hamiltonian matrix elements of order @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite + @xcite + @xcite spurious propagating waves pose a serious problem , since their presence within the energy gap changes the physical character of the model system from semiconducting to metallic .",
    "many schemes for eliminating the unphysical effects of spurious solutions have been proposed ( e.g. , changing or adding parameters in the hamiltonian , or excising the offending modes numerically or analytically ) , but none has yet found wide acceptance .",
    "the relative merits of the various proposals are not discussed here .",
    "instead , it is merely noted that all of these schemes take the form of patches applied to kane s original @xmath3  theory .",
    "the possibility of reconstructing @xmath3  theory on a different foundation has not been considered .",
    "this paper derives from first principles an @xmath4 @xmath3hamiltonian with no spurious solutions .",
    "the key step is a slight change in the standard choice of basis .",
    "this allows the adjustment - of - parameters method of ref .  , which was proposed only as a useful approximation , to be formulated rigorously .",
    "the present derivation proves that  within the limitations imposed by a second - order differential equation_this method is not an approximation_. that is , all terms of order @xmath2 derived from a clearly defined basis can be included without approximation .",

    "a comparison with density - functional calculations on in@xmath5ga@xmath6as / inp superlattices shows very good agreement .    in conventional @xmath3  perturbation theory , @xcite one uses a unitary transformation to construct a basis in which the @xmath3coupling between the states of interest ( set @xmath7 ) and all other states ( set @xmath8 ) is reduced to zero , while simultaneously renormalizing the masses in @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath7 includes the highest valence and lowest conduction states , the @xmath3  coupling within @xmath7 is either set to zero ( in single - band effective - mass theory @xcite ) or not modified at all ( in the multiband kane theory @xcite ) .",

    "the coupling can be either strengthened or weakened ; its actual value is fixed ( in one of several possible choices ) by setting the partially renormalized conduction - band mass to zero .",
    "this is precisely the method used to eliminate spurious solutions in ref .. however , the interface operator ordering derived here is more subtle than the simple heuristic model of ref .. the present theory also suggests the need for a reinterpretation of the standard data - fitting procedures used in @xmath3models .    the situation encountered here is analogous to a gauge transformation in quantum electrodynamics . although all gauges are equivalent in exact calculations , different gauges may yield different predictions in approximate calculations .",
    "@xcite likewise , the unitary transformation defined here would have no effect in an exact calculation , but in a second - order @xmath3  hamiltonian of finite dimension , varying the parameters of the unitary transformation generates a metal - insulator phase transition in the model system . the remedy proposed here is simply to choose transformation parameters that lie within the physical ( i.e. , insulating ) regime of the phase diagram .",

    ", a traditional bulk - crystal description can be obtained from the present atomistic formulation via a straightforward linear transformation of variables ( bearing in mind that the `` bulk '' compounds for the no - common - atom in@xmath5ga@xmath6as / inp material system must include not just in@xmath5ga@xmath6as and inp but also the interface materials inas and in@xmath5ga@xmath6p ) . nevertheless , there are advantages to becoming familiar with both points of view , since the atomistic perspective is simpler and better suited for the description of complex nanostructures .",
    "most envelope - function models are also expressed in a general form that allows the inclusion of arbitrary nonlinear material dependence in the effective - mass and momentum terms .",
    "however , the ability to include nonlinear terms does not necessarily imply greater accuracy , since the present results show that the operator ordering used in most envelope - function models is not correct even to linear order .",
    "the possibility of applying the present unitary transformation to a more general phenomenological hamiltonian with arbitrary nonlinear material dependence was examined during the development of this paper , but since the interface structure of the resulting theory is much more complicated than the linear theory , it was not considered worthwhile to publish the nonlinear results .",
    "the linear approach has the advantage of providing simple analytical expressions for precisely those terms that are of greatest importance in a multiband envelope - function theory .    for practical problems , a full implementation of the operator ordering derived here would require the knowledge of many parameters that have not been measured experimentally and can not yet be predicted accurately from first principles .",
    "therefore , in the near future , any practical application of the theory based purely on existing empirical data will require the use of some approximations .",
    "this point is underscored by the results obtained in sec .",
    "[ subsec : fit ] , which show that the bulk @xmath3  parameters generated by typical experimental data - fitting procedures already include a unitary transformation  of unknown magnitude  of the type defined here .",
    "the uncertainty would seem to be greatest for the convenient tabulations in review articles @xcite of parameters compiled from many sources .",
    "given such uncertainty in the existing experimental data , it is reasonable to base short - term applications of the present theory on the criterion of simplicity rather than theoretical rigor .",
    "if an unknown bulk unitary transformation is already present in the empirical parameters , the original lk basis can not be defined experimentally , and it is not possible to make any definite statements about operator ordering in heterostructures .",
    "therefore , one might as well choose something simple , such as the conventional bendaniel  duke operator ordering . for simplicity",
    ", one can apply this operator ordering _ after _ a bulk unitary transformation has been used to eliminate real spurious solutions , as in the heuristic model of ref ..    two choices of unitary transformations in heterostructures stand out for their simplicity .",
    "one is to set @xmath85 everywhere , @xcite which has computational advantages @xcite because it allows the conduction - band envelopes to be eliminated from explicit appearance in the envelope - function equations .",
    "@xcite the other is to select a single value of @xmath152 for the entire heterostructure , @xcite which is chosen to yield evanescent spurious solutions in accordance with the guidelines given in sec .",
    "[ subsec : choice ] .",
    "assuming that @xmath423 , this choice simplifies the interface boundary conditions ( for calculations based on the flat - band approximation ) because it ensures continuity of all envelopes . @xcite    the above approach is merely a quick practical fix in which the uncertainty in experimental parameters is openly acknowledged and even turned to advantage by selecting simple operator ordering and a parameter set with no real spurious solutions .",
    "the resulting errors in operator ordering  which are probably systematic  are simply ignored .    however , it is hoped that the present theory will also provide a stimulus for future work in which the sources of ambiguity in our present knowledge are steadily eliminated . with a careful combination of experimental data and empirically - based microscopic theory ( such as empirical pseudopotentials @xcite or empirical tight - binding theory@xcite ) it should be possible to establish for each material whether spurious solutions in the kane hamiltonian are really required by experiment or are merely an artifact of current data - fitting procedures .",
    "application of the same methods to heterostructures will provide more definitive results for the parameters that determine operator ordering . at the same time",
    ", extensions of the present _ ab initio _ techniques to include quasiparticle self - energies and projector - augmented waves should provide more accurate predictions of parameters from first principles .",
    "it is hoped that at some time in the near future these two lines of investigation will converge to yield a practical @xmath3  theory free from ambiguity .",
