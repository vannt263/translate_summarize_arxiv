    "in this paper , we are interested in the numerical approximation of a randomly - perturbed system of reaction - diffusion equations that can be written @xmath0 for @xmath1 , with initial conditions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath4 .",
    "the stochastic perturbation @xmath5 is a space - time white noise and @xmath6 is a small parameter .    in the recent article @xcite",
    ", we have proved that an averaging principle holds for such a system , and we have exhibited an order of convergence - with respect to @xmath7 - in a strong and in a weak sense : the slow component @xmath8 is approximated thanks to the solution of an averaged equation . in this article , we analyse a numerical method of time discretization which reproduces this averaging effect at the discrete time level .",
    "more precisely , our aim is to build a numerical approximation of the slow component @xmath8 , taking care of the stiffness induced by the time scale separation .",
    "the heterogeneous multiscale method - hmm - procedure can be used , as it is done in @xcite for sdes of the same kind .",
    "first we recall the general principle of such a method , which has been developped in various contexts , both deterministic and stochastic - see the review article @xcite and the references therein , as well as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in system ,",
    "the two components evolve at different time scales ; @xmath8 is the slow component of the problem , while the fast component @xmath9 has fast variations in time .",
    "we are indeed interested in evaluating the slow component , which can be thought as the mathematical model for a phenomenon appearing at the natural time scale of the experiment , whereas the fast component can often be interpreted as data for the slow component , taking care of effects at a faster time scale .",
    "instead of using a direct numerical method , which might require a very small time step size because of the fast component , we use a different solver for each time scale : a macrosolver and a microsolver .",
    "the macrosolver leads to the approximation of the slow component ; it takes into account data from the evolution at the fast time scale .",
    "the microsolver is then a procedure for estimating the unknown necessary data , using the evolution at the microtime scale , which also depends on the evolution at the macrotime scale .",
    "we emphasize a difference with the framework of @xcite : instead of analysing various numerical schemes , the infinite dimensional setting implies that we only focus on a semi - implicit euler scheme .    in section [ secttheo ] , we state the two main theorems of this article : we show a strong convergence result - theorem [ cvforte ] - as well as a weak convergence result - theorem [ cvfaible ] - which are similar to the available results for sdes . compared to @xcite , we propose modified and simplified proofs leading to apparently weaker error estimates ; we made this choice for various reasons .",
    "first , even if apparently we get weaker estimates , under an appropriate choice of the parameters the cost of the method remains of the same order .",
    "second , the generalization of the final dimensional results would not yield the same bounds , due to the regularity assumptions we make on the nonlinear coefficients of the equations .",
    "finally , we can extend the weak convergence result to the situation where the fast equation only satisfies a weak dissipativity assumption .    in the case of a linear fast equation - when @xmath10 is equal to @xmath11 - it is well - known that the second equation in is dissipative . in the general case , we make assumptions on @xmath10 so that this property is preserved for @xmath9 - see assumptions [ strictdiss ] and [ weakdiss ] below .",
    "the fast equation with frozen slow component - defined by in the abstract framework - then admits a unique invariant probability measure , which is ergodic and strongly mixing - with exponential convergence to equilibrium . under the strict dissipativity condition [ strictdiss ]",
    ", we can prove that the averaging principle holds in the strong and in the weak sense ; moreover the `` fast '' numerical scheme has the same asymptotic behaviour as the continuous time equation .",
    "if we only assume weak dissipativity of assumption [ weakdiss ] , the averaging principle only holds in the weak sense , and we can not prove uniqueness of the invariant law of the fast numerical scheme .",
    "nevertheless , in the general setting @xcite gives an approximation result of the invariant law of the continuous time equation with the numerical method which is used to prove theorem [ cvfaible ] ; the order of convergence is @xmath12 with respect to the timestep size - the precise result is recalled in theorem [ weakdistance ] .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sectdescri ] ,",
    "we give the definition of the numerical scheme .",
    "we then state the main assumptions made on the system of equations . in section [ secttheo ]",
    "we state the two main theorems proved in this article , while in section [ commsect ] we compare the efficiency of the hmm scheme with a direct one in order to justify the use of a new method . before proving the theorems ,",
    "we give some useful results on the numerical schemes .",
    "finally the last two sections contain the proof of the strong and weak convergence theorems .",
    "instead of working directly with system , we work with abstract stochastic evolution equations in hilbert spaces @xmath13 : @xmath14 with initial conditions @xmath15 , @xmath16 .    to get system from , we take @xmath17 ; the linear operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 are laplace operators with homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions - see example [ exampleab ] - and the nonlinearities @xmath20 and @xmath21 are nemytskii operators - see example [ exfg ] . the process @xmath22 is a cylindrical wiener process on @xmath13 - see section [ sectwiener ] . for precise assumptions on the coefficients ,",
    "we refer to section [ sectassumptions ] .",
    "we recall the idea of the averaging principle - proved in the previous article @xcite : when @xmath7 goes to @xmath11 , @xmath23 can be approximated by @xmath24 defined by the averaged equation @xmath25 the error is controlled in a strong sense by @xmath26 and in a weak sense by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 can be chosen as small as necessary , and where @xmath29 is a constant .",
    "the averaged coefficient @xmath30 - see - satisfies @xmath31,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the unique invariant probability measure of the fast process @xmath33 with frozen slow component - more details are given in section [ known ] .",
    "to apply the hmm strategy , we need to define a macrosolver and a microsolver .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 the macrotime step size , and by @xmath35 the microtime step size .",
    "let also @xmath36 be a given final time .",
    "the construction of the macrosolver is deeply based on the averaging principle : for @xmath37 @xmath38 can be approximated by @xmath39 . if the averaged coefficient @xmath30 was known , one could build an approximation with a deterministic numerical scheme on the averaged equation ; nevertheless in general it is not the case , and the idea is to calculate an approximation of this coefficient on - the - fly , by using the microsolver .",
    "therefore the macrosolver is defined in the following way : for any @xmath40 , @xmath41 with the initial condition @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 has to be defined ; before that , we notice that the above definition leads to a semi - implicit euler scheme - we use implicitness on the linear part , but the nonlinear part is explicit .",
    "if we define a bounded linear operator on @xmath13 by @xmath44 , we rather use the following explicit formula @xmath45    we want @xmath43 to be an approximation of @xmath46 . the role of the microsolver",
    "is to give an approximation of @xmath47 - the fast process with frozen slow component @xmath48 , when @xmath49 is fixed ; moreover we compute a finite number @xmath50 of independent replicas of the process , in order to approximate theoretical expectations by discrete averages over different realizations of the random variables , in a monte - carlo spirit .",
    "therefore the microsolver is defined in the following way : we fix a realization index @xmath51 , and a macrotime step @xmath49 ; then for any @xmath52 @xmath53 as above we can give an explicit formula @xmath54 where for any @xmath55 @xmath56 .",
    "the noises @xmath57 are defined by @xmath58 where @xmath59 are independent cylindrical wiener processes on @xmath13 .",
    "it is essential to use independent noises at each macrotime step .",
    "it is important to remark that this equation is well - posed in the hilbert space @xmath13 - see the conditions required when a cylindrical wiener process is used in section [ sectwiener ] - since @xmath60 is a hilbert - schmidt operator from @xmath13 to @xmath13 , under assumptions given in section [ sectassumptions ] .",
    "the missing definition can now be written : @xmath43 is given by @xmath61 @xmath62 is the number of microtime steps that are not used in the evaluation of the average in @xmath43 , while @xmath63 is the number of microtime steps that are then used for this evaluation .",
    "each macrotime step then requires the computation of @xmath64 values of the microsolver . at each macrotime step @xmath65",
    "must be initialized at time @xmath66 . in our proofs",
    ", this is not as important as in @xcite , but for definiteness we use the same method : we initialize with the last value computed during the previous macrotime step : @xmath67 , while @xmath68 .",
    "the aim of the analysis for hmm schemes is to prove that under an appropriate choice of the parameters @xmath69 of the scheme , we can bound the error by expressions of the following kind , where @xmath28 is chosen as small as necessary : for @xmath70 , we have the strong error estimate @xmath71 and if @xmath72 is a test function of class @xmath73 , bounded and with bounded derivatives , we have the weak error estimate @xmath74 the origin of the three error terms appears clearly in the proofs - see sections [ sectfort ] and [ sectfaible ] : the first one is the averaging error , the second one is the error in a deterministic scheme with the macrotime step , and the third one is the weak error in a scheme for stochastic equations with the microtime step .",
    "we recall that in the spde case the strong order of the semi - implicit euler scheme for the microsolver used here is @xmath75 , while the weak order is @xmath12 , while in the sde situation the respective orders are @xmath12 and @xmath76 .",
    "the macrosolver is deterministic , so that the order is @xmath76 .",
    "precise results for any choice of @xmath69 are given in theorems [ cvforte ] and [ cvfaible ] below , while the choice of these parameters is explained in section [ commsect ] .",
    "as mentioned above , system satisfies an averaging principle , and strong and weak order of convergence can be given .",
    "the hmm method relies on that idea .",
    "the natural assumptions are basically the same as the hypothesis needed to prove those results , but must be strenghtened sometimes . the typical kind of coefficients is specified in examples [ exampleab ] and [ exfg ] .      here ,",
    "we recall the definition of the cylindrical wiener process and of stochastic integral on a separable hilbert space @xmath13 - its norm is denoted by @xmath77 or just @xmath78 . for more details , see @xcite .",
    "we first fix a filtered probability space @xmath79 . a cylindrical wiener process on @xmath13",
    "is defined with two elements :    * a complete orthonormal system of @xmath13 , denoted by @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a subset of @xmath82 ; * a family @xmath83 of independent real wiener processes with respect to the filtration @xmath84 :    @xmath85    when @xmath81 is a finite set , we recover the usual definition of wiener processes in the finite dimensional space @xmath86 .",
    "however the subject here is the study of some stochastic partial differential equations , so that in the sequel the underlying hilbert space @xmath13 is infinite dimensional ; for instance when @xmath87 , an example of complete orthonormal system is @xmath88 - see example [ exampleab ] .",
    "a fundamental remark is that the series in does not converge in @xmath13 ; but if a linear operator @xmath89 is hilbert - schmidt , then @xmath90 converges in @xmath91 for any @xmath92 .",
    "we recall that a linear operator @xmath89 is said to be hilbert - schmidt when @xmath93 where the definition is independent of the choice of the orthonormal basis @xmath94 of @xmath13 .",
    "the space of hilbert - schmidt operators from @xmath13 to @xmath95 is denoted @xmath96 ; endowed with the norm @xmath97 it is an hilbert space .",
    "the stochastic integral @xmath98 is defined in @xmath95 for predictible processes @xmath99 with values in @xmath100 such that @xmath101 a.s ; moreover when @xmath102;\\mathcal{l}_2(h , k))$ ] , the following two properties hold : @xmath103 a generalization of it formula also holds - see @xcite .    for instance ,",
    "if @xmath104 , we can define @xmath105 we then have the following space - time white noise property @xmath106    therefore to be able to integrate a process with respect to @xmath107 requires some strong properties on the integrand ; in our spde setting , the hilbert - schmidt properties follow from the assumptions made on the linear coefficients of the equations .",
    "first , we have to specify some properties of the linear operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 coming into the definition of system ; we assume that the linear parts are of parabolic type , with space variable @xmath108 .",
    "we assume that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are unbounded linear operators , with domains @xmath109 and @xmath110 , which satisfy the following assumptions :    [ hypab ]    1 .   there",

    "if we look at the estimates of theorems [ cvforte ] and [ cvfaible ] at time @xmath227 , the factor @xmath228 is of size @xmath229 .",
    "the proofs rely on the following decomposition , which explains the origin of the different error terms : @xmath230 the numerical process @xmath231 is defined in below : it is the solution of the macrosolver with a known @xmath30 , while @xmath207 is solution of the macrosolver using @xmath43 . the continuous processes @xmath24 and @xmath23 are defined at the beginning of section [ sectdescri ] .",
    "the first term is bounded thanks to the averaging result , using strong and weak order of convergence results - see the article @xcite .",
    "the second term is the error in a deterministic numerical scheme , for which convergence results are classical ; we recall the estimate in proposition [ propoerrdet ] .",
    "the third term is the difference between the two numerical approximations , and the main task is the control of this part : we show that an extension of the averaging effect holds at the discrete time level , where @xmath232 plays the role of an averaged process for @xmath48 .    when we look at the theorems [ cvforte ] and [ cvfaible ] , we first remark that we obtain the same kind of bounds as in the finite dimensional case of @xcite",
    ". however we notice some differences ; they are due both to the infinite dimensional setting and to different proofs .",
    "first , the weak order of the euler scheme for spdes is only @xmath12 - see @xcite - while it is @xmath76 for sdes ; in the estimate , the strong order never appears , and this is one of the main theoretical advantages of the method . for completeness , we recall that the strong order is @xmath75 in the spde case - see @xcite - and @xmath12 for sdes .",
    "in fact , at least in the strictly dissipative case , we are comparing the invariant measures of the continuous fast equation with the invariant measure of its numerical approximation - see theorem [ weakdistance ] and corollary [ weakcor ] . in the weakly dissipative case ,",
    "we use the weak error estimates where the constants do not depend on the final time .",
    "we need some regularity on the initial condition @xmath143 in theorem [ cvfaible ] , since we apply the weak order averaging theorem of @xcite ; nonetheless the parameter @xmath233 does not appear in the different orders of convergence , but only in the constant @xmath29 .    in theorem [ cvfaible ] , we do not exactly obtain the same estimate as in @xcite , since @xmath50 does not appear : as a consequence , the estimate is not improved when @xmath50 is increasing .",
    "since we are looking at some weak error estimate , this can seem natural ; first @xmath50 appeared in the estimate of @xcite only because of some strong error estimate used in the proof , while here to prove theorem [ cvfaible ] we always think with a weak error state of mind .",
    "second , the corresponding term in the weak estimate of @xcite is easily controlled by @xmath34 , which already appears in another part of the error since we use a first order scheme for the macrosolver - and not a general scheme - so that there is no need for getting a better estimate .",
    "the proofs of theorems [ cvforte ] and [ cvfaible ] are inspired by the ones in @xcite , but are different .",
    "the strong error is analysed in a global way , as in the proof of the strong order theorem in @xcite .",
    "moreover we do not need a counterpart of lemma @xmath234 in @xcite , and we thus think that our method is more natural . for the control of the weak error , we introduce a new appropriate auxiliary function .",
    "as explained in the introduction , we present here some simplified results and proofs . in the stricly dissipative case , we could go further in the analysis of the error , thanks to the initialization procedure of the scheme , and to additional exponential convergence results .",
    "but after a very technical work , due to the regularity assumptions made on the nonlinear coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 we would only obtain a factor @xmath235 instead of @xmath34 in the finite dimensional case - where is any @xmath28 , which can be chosen as small as necessary , and @xmath173 is defined in assumption [ hypf ] and depends on the regularity properties of the nonlinearities @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "nevertheless , the cost of the scheme remains of the same order even if we do not use those better estimates .",
    "we consider that @xmath7 is fixed , and then the numerical method depends on several parameters @xmath236 ; we would like to give some explicit choices of the parameters for which we have a simple bound , and for which a direct scheme , where the stiffness of the system is not treated , is less efficient , for the cost defined by @xmath237 this is the total number of microtime steps for @xmath238 .",
    "we take @xmath227 : then @xmath239 .",
    "the time scale separation parameter @xmath7 is supposed to be very small , while we fix some tolerance @xmath240 for the error in the numerical scheme : more precisely , we want the error to be @xmath241 where @xmath242 satisfies either @xmath243 - strong error - or @xmath244 - weak error - if the parameters @xmath245 and @xmath246 are defined by the conditions @xmath247 ( strong error ) and @xmath248 ( weak error ) : the numerical error is dominant with respect to the averaging error .",
    "we want to show that we can choose the parameters of the scheme such that each term of the estimate of the theorem [ cvforte ] are of size @xmath240 , except the first one , and such that the cost of the scheme is lower than the cost of a direct scheme .",
    "* we first notice that the choice for @xmath34 and @xmath249 is easy : @xmath250 where @xmath243 or @xmath244 , and @xmath224 are fixed .",
    "the choice of other parameters @xmath251 changes when we look at the strong or at the weak error . *",
    "we first focus on the strong convergence case .",
    "we consider the case when either @xmath252 or @xmath253 .",
    "we obtain + [ choicestrong ] + [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]    + unlike in the finite dimensional situation , the bound depends on a factor @xmath254 - where @xmath173 is linked to the regularity of the nonlinear coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the charge of this difference could be taken by either @xmath63 or @xmath62 ;",
    "the advantage of choosing @xmath62 is that the difference only involves a logarithmic factor on the final cost . as a consequence",
    ", we can make no difference between the choices @xmath253 and @xmath252 .",
    "+ we can now make a comparison with the cost coming from the use of a direct scheme : since the strong order of euler scheme for spdes is @xmath255 , the error can be bounded by @xmath256 for some constant @xmath29 . therefore to have a bound of size @xmath240 , the time step size @xmath35 much satisfy @xmath257 .",
    "this leads to a cost @xmath258 we conclude that in this situation the hmm numerical method is better , since the ratio of the cost tends to @xmath11 when @xmath259 - under the condition @xmath243 .",
    "* we now focus on the weak error estimate . here",
    "@xmath50 plays no role , so that @xmath252 is the good choice ! the time steps @xmath34 and @xmath35 are still given by .",
