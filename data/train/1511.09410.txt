    "+ it is well known that the squared singular values of a complex rectangular gaussian random matrix form a determinantal point process on @xmath0",
    ". the correlation kernel of this determinantal point process can be expressed in terms of the classical laguerre polynomials , and can be studied in different asymptotic regimes . in particular , the bulk , soft edge , and hard edge scaling limits of the correlation kernel are obtained using known asymptotic expansions of the laguerre polynomials , see , for example , forrester ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch . 7 ) .",
    "the hard edge scaling limit of the kernel can be written in terms of bessel functions , and it is called the bessel - kernel .",
    "the limiting determinantal point process defined by the bessel - kernel was studied by many authors , see , for example , forrester @xcite and tracy and widom @xcite , and we will use the representation of the former .",
    "it enjoys important applications in physics , including the dirac operator spectrum in quantum chromodynamics @xcite .",
    "products of @xmath1 independent complex gaussian random matrices have seen much progress recently , and we refer to @xcite and the thesis @xcite for recent reviews including more general product matrices . in particular one of the authors and his coworkers @xcite obtained a determinantal point process describing the squared singular values of such a product matrix .",
    "it was shown by kuijlaars and zhang @xcite that the kernel of this point process has a remarkable hard edge scaling limit .",
    "the limiting correlation kernel called meijer g - kernel labelled by @xmath1 can be considered as a generalisation of the classical bessel - kernel with @xmath2 .",
    "it is universal as it appears in several other random matrix ensembles , including the cauchy multi - matrix model @xcite , in the muttalib - borodin ensemble @xcite as was pointed out by kuijlaars and stivigny @xcite , and in the product of two coupled matrices as was shown by the authors @xcite .",
    "the question arises whether there is a family of determinantal point process that interpolates between the bessel - kernel point process , and the meijer g - kernel point process for a given @xmath1 .",
    "we note that interpolating ensembles are of great interest in random matrix theory .",
    "a classical example is the ensemble solved by pandey and mehta @xcite that interpolates between the gaussian orthogonal and gaussian unitary ensemble and thus describes the onset of time reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "another example is the ensemble of hermitian matrices introduced by moshe , neuberger , and shapiro @xcite , and studied further by johansson @xcite .",
    "this ensemble gives rise to a family of determinantal processes whose edge behaviour interpolates between the poisson process of uncorrelated eigenvalues and the airy - kernel point process that appears in many applications .",
    "for completeness one could also mention the works of bohigas and coworkers @xcite on deformations of the tracy - widom distribution and their application to thinning processes . also there interpolations between random matrix ensembles and classical statistical ensembles occur .",
    "in this paper we present a new family of determinantal point processes that indeed interpolates between the bessel - kernel of a single gaussian matrix @xmath2 , and the meijer g - kernel responsible for the hard edge scaling limit of the product of @xmath3 independent gaussian complex matrices .",
    "this new family arises from the product of two coupled random matrices .",
    "the squared singular values of the product matrix of such matrices form a family of determinantal point process on @xmath0 , as was shown in @xcite for finite size @xmath4 of the product matrix .",
    "once we assume that the coupling parameter @xmath5 depends on @xmath4 , the asymptotic investigation of this point process leads to several scaling regimes .",
    "in particular , if the coupling parameter depends on @xmath4 as @xmath6 , then the two matrices become strongly coupled . the resulting hard edge scaling limit gives a new family of limiting determinantal processes parameterised by the parameter @xmath7 , that is defined by the correlation kernel @xmath8 .",
    "we show that this family is integrable in the sense of its , izergin , korepin and slavnov @xcite and can be considered as a deformation of the bessel - kernel point process , where @xmath7 plays the role of the deformation parameter .",
    "this means that as @xmath9 , the correlation kernel @xmath8 converges to the bessel - kernel .",
    "moreover , as @xmath10 the correlation kernel @xmath8 ( under a certain rescaling ) converges to the corresponding meijer g - kernel of the product of @xmath3 independent complex gaussian matrices .",
    "thus @xmath8 has the desired interpolation property .",
    "the existence of such a limiting kernel could have been expected for the following reason .",
    "when studying the complex eigenvalues instead of the singular values of two coupled matrices , there exists the so - called weak non - hermiticity limit @xcite , where the two coupled matrices that are multiplied become almost complex conjugates of each other @xcite . in the same sense as above , the limiting kernel of osborn @xcite interpolates between real eigenvalues described by the bessel - kernel , and the corresponding kernel of complex eigenvalues at strong non - hermiticity ( which can also be written in terms of meijer g - functions ) . in our case the singular values remain always real and positive for the entire family of kernels @xmath8 , and the limit of strongly coupled matrices provides a new interpolating process as well .",
    "a further example should be mentioned here .",
    "the family of kernels found by borodin @xcite originally given in terms of wright s generalised bessel functions also depends on a parameter @xmath11 .",
    "it interpolates between the bessel - kernel of the laguerre ensemble at @xmath12 , and the meijer g - kernel at @xmath3 with specific parameter values when choosing @xmath13 or @xmath14 as it was shown by kuijlaars and stivigny @xcite .",
    "initially the muttalib - borodin ensemble @xcite was introduced as an eigenvalue model , but recently upper triangular matrix representations have been constructed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite an alternative double contour representation of borodin s kernel was found for arbitrary real @xmath15 .",
    "it extends an alternative representation derived in @xcite for @xmath14 where the muttalib - borodin ensemble reduces to a random matrix model of disordered bosons . in the complex contour integral form",
    "it is obvious that borodin s kernel is different from our limiting kernel given by a different double contour integral as well .",
    "furthermore , they lead to different meijer g - kernels at @xmath3 .    several open questions would be interesting to address .",
    "it is well known that the fredholm determinant of the bessel - kernel can be related to painlev v @xcite .",
    "it is open if such a relation can be established for the meijer g - kernel , see however @xcite for progress in that directions . and",
    "it is even less clear if a parameter dependent relation to painlev equations exists for our interpolating kernel . from the physical side",
    "it would be very interesting to see if our kernel appears in the singular value spectrum of quantum chromodynamics with iso - spin chemical potential which was studied in @xcite on the level of an effective field theory .",
    "the remainder of this article is organised as follows . in the following subsections we summarise the known results for the joint density ( subsection [ ensembles ] ) and kernel ( subsection [ exactformulae ] ) of the product of two coupled matrices @xcite , two independent matrices @xcite and the well - known laguerre ensemble of a single matrix , respectively",
    "our main results on the new limiting kernel ( subsection [ hardedge ] ) which is integrable ( subsection [ integrable ] ) and interpolating between the latter two ( subsection [ interpolating ] ) are given at the end of this section . before turning to the proofs , in section [ comparison ]",
