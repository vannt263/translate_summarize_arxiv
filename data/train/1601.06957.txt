    "at first glance , the motion of the gas - liquid interface along the solid surface is a purely hydrodynamic problem .",
    "however , it attracted significant attention from the physicists since the work @xcite , which showed an unphysical divergence that appears in the hydrodynamic treatment if a motion of a wedge - shaped liquid slides along the solid surface .",
    "the reason for this divergence lies in the no - slip condition ( i.e. zero liquid velocity ) at the solid surface .",
    "being so common in hydrodynamics , this boundary condition is questionable in the vicinity of the contact line along which the gas - liquid interface joins the solid . in the absence of mass transfer between the gas and the liquid ,",
    "the no - slip condition requires zero velocity for the contact line that is supposed to be formed of the liquid molecules in the contact with the solid .",
    "it means that , for example , an oil drop can not move along the glass because of the no - slip condition ! of course , this contradicts the observations .",
    "the experiment @xcite demonstrated that the velocity on the liquid - gas interface is directed towards the contact line during the contact line advance .",
    "the authors interpreted this result by the rolling ( `` caterpillar '' ) motion of the drop @xcite .",
    "however , later theoretical study @xcite shows that such a motion is compatible with the no - slip condition on the non - deformable solid surface only for the contact angles close to @xmath0 .",
    "the justification of the no - slip condition is well known @xcite : it is the excess of the attractive force between the solid and the liquid molecules over the force between two liquid molecules .",
    "this attraction has a tendency to prevent the motion of the liquid molecules adjacent to the solid .",
    "obviously , the same forces resist when these molecules are forced to move . in other words , some relatively large ( with respect to viscous dissipation ) energy should be spent for this forcing .",
    "numerous microscopic theories ( see e.g. @xcite ) propose different phenomena as to be responsible for the contact line motion .",
    "however , no general theory has been agreed upon .",
    "this situation is partly due to the scarceness of the information that can be extracted from the experiments .",
    "most of them deal with either drops with cylindrical symmetry ( circular contact lines ) or the climbing of the contact line over a solid immersed into a liquid ( straight contact line ) . in these experiments , the contact line velocity @xmath1 measured in the normal direction does not vary along the contact line on a macroscopic scale larger than the size of the surface defects .",
    "the experiments with non - spherical drops where such a variation exists can give additional information .",
    "this information can be used to test microscopic models of the contact line motion . to our knowledge",
    ", there are only two kinds of investigated situations that feature the non - spherical drops .",
    "the first one is the sliding of the drop along an inclined surface @xcite .",
    "the second concerns the relaxation of the sessile drops of complicated shape towards the equilibrium shape of spherical cap .",
    "this latter case was studied experimentally in @xcite for water drops on the silanized silicon wafers at room temperature .",
    "the present article deals with this second case .",
    "the principal results of @xcite can be summarized as follows :    \\(i ) the relaxation of the drop from the elongated shape towards the spherical shape is exponential .",
    "the characteristic relaxation time @xmath2 is proportional to the drop size .",
    "the drop size can be characterized by the contact line radius @xmath3 at equilibrium when the drop eventually relaxes towards a spherical cap .",
    "\\(ii ) the dependence of @xmath2 on the equilibrium contact angle @xmath4 is not monotonous : @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "\\(iii ) the relaxation is extremely slow .",
    "the capillary number @xmath7 is of the order of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the surface tension and @xmath10 is the shear viscosity .",
    "since the motion is not externally forced , a small @xmath11 shows that the energy dissipated in the vicinity of the contact line is much larger than in the bulk of the drop .",
    "the contact line motion is characterized by the normal component @xmath1 of its velocity .",
    "many existing theories result in the following relationship between @xmath1 and the dynamic contact angle @xmath4 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the static contact angle , @xmath14 is a constant characteristic velocity and @xmath15 is a function of two arguments , the form of which depends on the model used . for all existing models ,",
    "the following relation is satisfied @xmath16 which implies the trivial condition @xmath17 .",
    "it means simply that the line is immobile when @xmath18 .",
    "the theories of voinov @xcite and cox @xcite correspond to @xmath19 there are many theories ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) which result in @xmath20 in a recent model by pomeau @xcite , it is proposed that @xmath21 with the coefficient @xmath14 that depends on the direction of motion ( advancing or receding ) but not on the amplitude of @xmath1 .",
    "since the drop evolution is extremely slow , the drop shape can be calculated using the quasi - static argument according to which at each moment the drop surface can be calculated from the constant curvature condition and the known position of the contact line .",
    "the major problem is how to find this position .",
    "independently of the particular contact line motion mechanism , at least two approaches are possible .",
    "the first of them is the ",
    "local \" approach @xcite , which consists in the determination of the position of a given point of the contact line from eq .",
    "( [ vnl ] ) where @xmath4 is assumed to be the _ local _ value of the dynamic contact angle at this point .",
    "another , non - local approach is suggested in sec .",
    "[ nonloc ] .",
    "certainly , both of this approaches should give the same result when @xmath1 does not vary along the contact line .",
    "however , we show that the result is different in the opposite case .",
    "the influence of surface defects on the contact line dynamics is considered in sec .",
    "in this section we generalize another approach , suggested in @xcite , for an arbitrary drop shape .",
    "this approach postulates neither eq .  ( [ vnl ] ) nor a particular line motion mechanism .",
    "it simply assumes that the energy dissipated during the contact line motion is proportional to its length and does not depend on the direction of motion ( advancing or receding ) .",
    "then , at low contact line velocity , the leading contribution to the energy dissipated per unit time ( i.e. the dissipation function ) can be written in the form @xmath22 where the integration is performed over the contact line and @xmath23 is the constant dissipation coefficient . according to the earlier discussed experimental results @xcite , the dissipation in the bulk is assumed to be much smaller than that in the vicinity of the contact line .    since we assume that most dissipation takes place in the region of the drop adjacent to the contact line , our discussion is limited to the case where the prewetting film ( that is observed for zero or very low contact angles ) is absent",
    "this situation corresponds to the conditions of the experiment @xcite where the dropwise ( as opposed to filmwise ) condensation shows the absence of the prewetting liquid film .",
    "the above assumption also limits the description to the partial wetting case .",
    "this assumption is also justified by the experimental conditions under which it is extremely difficult to obtain macroscopic convex drops for the contact angles @xmath24 because of the contact line pinning @xcite .",
    "the main reason is that the potential energy @xmath25 of the drop from eq .",
    "( [ u2 ] ) goes to zero as the contact angle goes to zero . at small contact angles @xmath25 is not large enough to overcome the pinning forces that originate from the surface defects , see sec .",
    "therefore , the macroscopic convex drops under consideration can not be observed at small contact angles .",
    "generally speaking , the behavior of the drop obeys the lagrange equation @xcite @xmath26 where the lagrangian @xmath27 is the function of the generalized coordinates @xmath28 and of their time derivatives which are denoted by a dot .",
    "the current time is denoted by @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the kinetic energy , and @xmath31 is the potential energy . since there is no externally forced liquid motion in this problem and the drop shape change is extremely slow , we can neglect the kinetic energy by putting @xmath32",
    ". then eq .",
    "( [ lagr ] ) reduces to @xmath33 the expression applied first to the contact line motion in @xcite .",
    "the potential energy of a sessile drop is @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath9 is the liquid surface tension , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the areas of the vapor - liquid and liquid - solid interfaces respectively and @xmath37 is the equilibrium value of the contact angle .",
    "we neglect the contribution due to the van der waals forces because we consider macroscopic drops and large contact angles @xmath38 . for such drops the van der waals",
    "forces influence the interface shape only in the very close vicinity of the contact line and this influence can be neglected .    in general",
    "the static contact angle @xmath13 is not equal to @xmath37 because of the presence of the defects , a problem which will be treated in the section [ def ] .",
    "meanwhile , we assume that @xmath39 .",
    "the gravitational contribution is neglected in eq .",
    "( [ uu ] ) because the drops under consideration are supposed to be small , with the radius much smaller than the capillary length",
    ". the volume of a sessile drop is fixed .",
    "its calculation provides us with another equation , which closes the problem provided that the shape of the drop surface is known .",
    "the drop shape is determined from the condition of the quasi - equilibrium which results in the constant curvature of the drop surface .",
    "usually , the wetting dynamics is observed either for the spreading of droplets with the shape of the spherical cap , or for the motion of the liquid meniscus in a cylindrical capillary , or for the extraction of a solid plate from the liquid @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "the contact line velocity @xmath1 does not vary along the contact line and the dissipation function in the form eq .",
    "( [ diss ] ) results in the expression @xcite @xmath40 which is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ vnl ] ) , with the function @xmath15 taking the usual form  ( [ fcos ] ) .",
    "one might think that this equivalence confirms the universal nature of this expression . in the next section",
    "we show that it is not exactly so because the non - local approach results in a different expression when @xmath1 varies along the contact line .",
    "let us now apply the algorithm described above to the problem of drop relaxation .",
    "a shape for a non - spherical drop surface of constant curvature can be found only numerically . in order to treat the problem analytically , we approximate the drop shape by a spheroidal cap that is described in cartesian @xmath41 coordinate system by the equation @xmath42 at @xmath43 , the plane xoy corresponding to the solid surface .",
    "the symmetry of the problem allows only quarter of the drop ( see fig .  [ quarter ] ) to be considered .    .",
    "the local contact angles at the points m and n are shown too.,height=226 ]    since one of the parameters @xmath44 is fixed by the condition of the conservation of the drop volume that can be calculated as @xmath45 there are only two free parameters left .",
    "the time - dependent parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be taken as generalized coordinates .",
    "however , it is more convenient to use another set of parameters , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which are the half - axes of the ellipse that form the base of the drop ( see fig .  [ quarter ] ) , @xmath50 .",

    "the reason is the limitation of the spheroid model for the drop shape .",

    "the last inequality provides us with the limit of the validity for the spheroidal model .    to conclude this section we note that our non - local approach to the dynamics of wetting is not equivalent to the traditional local approach .",

    "additional experiments are needed to reveal which approach is the most suitable . under the assumption that the @xmath95 dependence ( if any ) is weak , we find that the relaxation time decreases with the contact angle .",
    "this result explains the decrease of the relaxation time at large contact angles observed in @xcite .",
    "we think that the opposite tendency observed for the small contact angles is related to the influence of the surface addressed in the next section .",
    "the motion of the contact line in the presence of defects has been frequently studied ( see @xcite for a review ) . however ,",
    "little is understood at the moment because the problem is very sophisticated .",
    "most of its studies deal with the influence of the defects on the static contact line ( see , e. g. @xcite ) when they are responsible for the contact angle hysteresis .",
    "the latter was studied in @xcite and @xcite for the wedge geometry which assumes the external forcing of the contact line .",
    "when the contact line moves under the action of a force @xmath96 , it encounters pinning on the random potential created by surface defects .",
    "thus the motion shows the  stick - slip \" behavior .",
    "it is characteristic for a wide range of physical systems where pinning takes place and is the basis of the theory of dynamical critical phenomena , in which the average contact line velocity is @xmath97 where the exponent @xmath98 is universal and @xmath99 is the pinning threshold .",
    "this expression is often applied ( see @xcite and refs . therein ) to the contact line motion in the systems , where the geometry of the meniscus does not depend on the dragging force .",
    "however , the values of @xmath98 vary widely depending on the experimental conditions and do not correspond to the theoretical predictions .",
    "the motion of the contact line during the coalescence of drops is even more complicated because the geometry of the meniscus is constantly changing .",
    "therefore , application of the expression ( [ v ] ) is even more questionable in this situation .    in this section",
    "we employ the formalism developed in the previous section in order to understand the influence of the surface defects on the relaxation time of the drop where the contact line is _ not forced externally_. the surface defects are modeled by the spatial variation of the local density of the surface energy , which can be related to the local value of the equilibrium contact angle @xmath100 by the young formula as was suggested in @xcite to describe the static contact angles .",

    "these approaches give the same results for very small contact angles or for the normal contact line velocity that does not vary along the contact line , which is the case of a drop that has the shape of a spherical cap .",
    "in other cases ( large contact angle , non - spherical drops ) the results of these two approaches differ .",
    "we carried out calculations assuming that the drop surface is a spheroid . in reality , its surface is not a spheroid and has a constant curvature .",
