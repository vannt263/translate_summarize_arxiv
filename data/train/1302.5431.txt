    "recently , there has been a surge of renewed interest in 5__d _ _ transition metal oxides , such as the iridates .",
    "the electrons in these compounds are more spatially extended than in their 3__d _ _ and 4__d _ _ counterparts , resulting in a smaller coulomb interaction ( u ) and a larger bandwidth ( w ) .",
    "this should make 5__d _ _ transition - metal oxides metallic ; however , it is believed that the large spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in the 5__d _ _ materials drives some of them insulating .",
    "the prototype of this spin - orbit - driven insulating behavior is the single - layered iridate , sr@xmath0ir0@xmath1 .",
    "tunneling spectroscopy is the most direct method for probing a material s density of states , which for mott insulators is not well understood and often has contributions from multiple excitations .",
    "the interesting phenomenon with this material is that the soc parameter is large enough to allow even a modest coulomb interaction to open a mott gap .",
    "we use scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) to directly measure the mott gap .",
    "since tunneling spectroscopy is mostly sensitive to the charge property of electrons , magnon excitations are rarely seen in tunneling experiments .",
    "interestingly , in the present study , the soc in sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 allows an anomalous magnon feature to be seen .",

    "sr@xmath0iro@xmath1 has not been observed , and this system has been shown to be insulating for temperatures up to 600 k. @xcite this material has five valence electrons to fill the 5__d _ _ orbital .",
    "crystal fields split this band into a lower - energy t@xmath5 band and a higher - energy e@xmath6 band .",
    "soc then splits the t@xmath5 band into a j@xmath7 that is filled with four electrons , and the remaining electron half fills the more highly energetic j@xmath8 state .",
    "the effects of band splitting due to crystal fields and soc are shown in fig . [",

    "sriro4 is an insulator that has an energy gap with a full width defined as 2@xmath11 .",
    "measurements of the excitation gap using resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) suggest values of 2@xmath11 = 400 mev @xcite and 2@xmath11 = 580 mev , @xcite respectively .",

    "this local probe of the electronic structure provides a complementary perspective to measurements with other techniques .",
    "our experiments were conducted with a home - built pan - style stm@xcite with a commercial controller . the stm was oriented vertically inside a cryogenic probe , allowing for _ in - situ _ sample cleaving and exchange .",
    "the probe was evacuated to p @xmath13 torr at room temperature , and then the pressure was lowered further by cryogenically cooling the entire experimental probe .",
    "the samples were oriented such that the c - axis was parallel to the stm tip .",
    "the crystals were prepared with the flux method .",
    "the samples were cleaved _ in - situ _ at t = 77 k by breaking off a small rod that was attached to the top of the sample .",
    "the weakest bond is the sr - o bond between an iro@xmath2 octahedra and an sr atom in neighboring atomic layers .",
    "this weak bond leaves the sro layer to be exposed after cleaving .",
    "thus , the iro@xmath0 layer , which is responsible for this material s electrical conduction , lies underneath an insulating layer , and this limits our resolution to single atomic steps .",

    "@xcite bulk magnetometry and muon spin relaxation show a change in magnetic order at low temperature , with an onset at roughly 20 k. the appearance of a new inelastic loss feature in the sts at low temperature is consistent with a change in magnetic order , and suggests that the density of states for magnetic excitations at low temperature has an additional peak at @xmath36 mev compared to the high - temperature density of states for magnetic excitations .",
