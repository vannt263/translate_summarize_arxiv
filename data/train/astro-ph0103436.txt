    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are observed at a rate of about one per day and are in some cases accompanied by optical afterglows that are useful in determining properties of the burst such as its redshift .",
    "current models that attempt to explain the enormous apparent energy release , the multiband spectra and the temporal behavior of afterglow lightcurves typically invoke a highly collimated relativistic jet which is beamed towards the earth .",
    "the lightcurve from a highly collimated jet is expected initially to decay as a low power of @xmath4 ( e.g. flux @xmath5 ) and then break to a steeper slope ( e.g. flux @xmath6 ) at late times @xcite .",
    "a number of grb afterglows show evidence for just this behavior @xcite . this has led @xcite to conclude that the grb emission is collimated into opening angles between 3@xmath7 and 25@xmath7 with @xmath8 as an average",
    ".    one important feature of the jet model of grbs is that the vast majority of grbs are beamed in directions away from the earth and therefore not observed in gamma - rays .",
    "however , the afterglow emission , occurring at much later time and at longer wavelength should be beamed into a larger fraction of the sky due to the decay of the jet lorentz factor with time .",
    "there should therefore be afterglows that are observable when the associated grb is not @xcite .",
    "as first suggested by @xcite , the ratio of the  orphan \" afterglow rate to the grb rate might allow measurement of the grb collimation angle @xmath0 , via the equation @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the solid angle subtended by the jet , @xmath11 is the angle into which the afterglow is beamed , and @xmath12 is the efficiency corrected event rate for optical afterglows .",
    "thus , by counting the rate at which orphan afterglows are detected , we could measure the average grb jet angle , and independently check other methods @xcite of measuring grb collimation .",
    "rhoads method has already been applied several times to extant searches for type ia supernovae and other optical transients .",
    "rhoads argued that the lack of afterglow detections by the supernova cosmology project and the high-@xmath13 supernova search roughly limited @xmath14 , based upon a lack of detections over 2 years exposure .",
    "the continued non - detection of orphans since that time has been used by several groups to set stronger collimation limits . for example , @xcite found @xmath15 , and @xcite quotes a transient search by shaefer et al . to claim @xmath16 .",
    "if optical afterglow emission is only mildly beamed ( e.g. @xmath17 ) , then this is marginally inconsistent with the collimation factors ( @xmath18 ) claimed by @xcite , and could render untenable most solar mass progenitor models , given the inefficiency of converting rest mass into gamma - ray emission @xcite .    in this paper , however , we argue that current supernova searches place no constraints upon grb collimation .",
    "one reason for this is that present surveys are too shallow , narrow , and infrequent to detect significant off - axis emission . using a simplified model of grb afterglow emission and survey detection efficiency",
    ", we show that present supernova surveys are generically expected to detect ( far ) less than one orphan afterglow .",
    "a deeper reason for the impotence of present surveys is the fact that , within the context of the leading grb afterglow model @xcite , the effective afterglow beaming angle scales with the grb jet angle , @xmath19 .",
    "because of this scaling , the ratio @xmath20 is unchanged even as the grb jet angle is varied from moderate angles ( @xmath21 ) to arbitrarily small angles ( @xmath22 ) , and so the ratio of detected orphan afterglows to grbs can not be used to measure @xmath0 .",
    "we derive this scaling below using a simplified model of grb jet emission , however we can understand this result in more general terms . from relativistic kinematics , we know that the jet lorentz factor @xmath23 , beaming angle @xmath24 , and observer time @xmath4 are related by simple power laws , and as mentioned above the observed flux @xmath25 is a simple power law in time . thus , the beaming angle is a ( scale free ) power law in @xmath23 , @xmath4 and @xmath25 . in the limit",
    "@xmath26 the only angular scale in the problem becomes @xmath0 , so we expect the effective beaming angle to scale as the jet angle , @xmath19 .",
    "this should break down in the nonrelativistic limit @xmath27 .",
    "this scaling of @xmath28 with @xmath0 severely hampers the ability of optical orphan searches to measure or constrain grb collimation .",
    "in fact , we argue in this paper that measurement of the grb jet angle may be impossible using either present or future optical supernova surveys .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe our simple model of emission from a grb afterglow . in   3 we estimate the afterglow detection rate using this simple model . in   4 we discuss the results of our calculations , and in ",
    "5 we give our conclusions , along with some discussion and caveats .",
    "grb - alerted afterglows ( `` on - axis afterglows '' ) are now well studied . in most cases ,",
    "their time dependence can be characterized as a broken power - law , @xmath29 , with a power - law break from @xmath30 to @xmath31 occurring at late times when the relativistic beaming angle @xmath32 exceeds the jet opening angle @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath23 is the bulk lorentz factor of the relativistic jet .",
    "this break occurs at a time @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the inferred energy of the ejecta assuming isotropic expansion , in units of @xmath35 ergs , and @xmath36 is the density of the surrounding ism in @xmath37 .",
    "grb optical emission has a wide range in apparent brightness , ranging from 9th magnitude for the prompt optical emission associated with grb 990123 , down to the limiting magnitude @xmath38 of follow - up searches for afterglows . @xcite",
    "have argued that most ( @xmath39 ) afterglows are even fainter than this , and have therefore eluded detection .",
    "observers of orphan afterglows , on the other hand , would see off - axis lightcurves , which differ from on - axis lightcurves .",
    "the behavior of off - axis emission is governed by relativistic effects , as well as the lateral spreading and internal structure of the jet .",
    "we will first consider the effects of relativistic kinematics , and then consider lateral spreading and jet internal structure .",
    "since the internal structure and time evolution of grb jets is quite uncertain we will consider throughout two limiting cases which we hope will bracket reality .    as a simple model ,",
    "consider a radiating plasma moving relativistically along the jet axis , with bulk lorentz factor @xmath23 relative to us , and radiating isotropically in its own frame .",
    "the measured power , as a function of angle @xmath24 with respect to the jet axis in our frame , is @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the ( isotropic ) power per unit solid angle in the plasma frame , and @xmath42 as usual .",
    "let us assume that the lorentz factor @xmath23 and rest frame flux @xmath41 evolve with time to give an observed on - axis ( @xmath43 ) lightcurve @xmath44 matching the lightcurves observed for optical grb afterglows , i.e. @xmath45 . for early times before the break @xmath46 while at late times after the break @xmath47 . since @xmath48 , with @xmath49 before the break and @xmath50 after the break @xcite , this means @xmath51 .",
    "this then requires @xmath52 . with our assumption of rest frame isotropy",
    ", we obtain the flux seen by off - axis observers as a function of angle @xmath24 and lorentz factor @xmath23 , @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the flux seen by an on - axis observer at the break time @xmath55 , and we have generalized the exponent 4 to the parameter @xmath56 for later use . this function with @xmath57 is plotted as a function of @xmath4 for several values of @xmath24 in figure [ reallightcurve ] .",
    "several features follow from equation [ eqn : real ] and figure [ reallightcurve ] .",
    "first , the lightcurve seen at angle @xmath24 peaks at a time @xmath58 which can be estimated by setting @xmath59 .",
    "next , the flux rises to the peak roughly as @xmath60 , and decays after peak as @xmath61 .",
    "also , the flux is nearly independent of angle for @xmath62 ; that is the various lightcurves all match together at late times when the viewing angle becomes small relative to the beaming angle .",
    "finally , when @xmath63 , an off - axis viewer at @xmath64 should see comparable flux to an on - axis observer inside @xmath0 , and the off - axis afterglow lightcurve should decay with roughly the same slope as the on - axis afterglow .",
    "note that off - axis ( @xmath64 ) afterglows do not peak until after the on - axis power - law break , which typically occurs hours to days after the grb @xcite .",
    "this implies that orphan afterglows , even at peak brightness , should be far fainter than their grb - triggered siblings , and thus should be much more difficult to detect .",
    "we can roughly estimate how much fainter as follows .",
    "after the break , the afterglow flux decays as @xmath65 , while the lorentz factor decays as @xmath66 @xcite , so the flux scales as @xmath67 . for a reasonable estimate of the jet angle , we would like to detect orphans at large viewing angles , say @xmath68 .",
    "this means detecting emission at times when the lorentz factor has decayed to @xmath69 .",
    "taking @xmath70 at the break , we see that the flux is 7 or 8 magnitudes fainter by the time @xmath69 than at the break .",
    "this immediately shows why current supernova searches are not expected to detect orphan afterglows .",
    "typical limiting magnitudes for such searches are near @xmath71 , which @xcite claim is too shallow to detect most on - axis afterglows , let alone far fainter off - axis orphan afterglows .",
    "this implies that detectable orphan afterglows are mostly contained in a cone of opening angle not much larger than @xmath0 , so we do not expect many more orphan afterglows to appear in sn surveys than on - axis afterglows .",
    "additionally , we show in the next section that the relatively infrequent monitoring characteristic of current sn surveys ( e.g. @xmath72 days ) causes most bright orphans to be missed .    we shall quantify these broad statements in the next section with a calculation of the detection rates expected in surveys , using this simple model of off - axis afterglow emission . before proceeding",
    ", we pause to note that we have , so far , neglected the effects of finite jet width and jet spreading .",
    "both of these should lead to greater off - axis emission than indicated by equation [ eqn : real ] . to obtain an upper limit to the effects of the uncertain jet evolution ( and",
    "thus bracket the range of possible fluxes seen by off - axis observers ) , we consider the following simple picture .",
    "the effect of finite jet width on the off - axis lightcurve is to point some of the emitting material more closely to the observer s line of sight , and to point other emitting material further from the observer s line of sight .",
    "a proper calculation of this effect would involve specifying the emission profile in the jet and integrating over the jet face @xcite , but in the spirit of setting upper bounds on the detection rate , we can get a sense of the effect by simpler means .",
    "consider the emission from the part of the jet face most closely pointing to a fiducial off - axis observer at @xmath24 .",
    "this material is moving at an angle @xmath73 from the observer s line of sight , so we can approximate the flux from this part of the jet face by replacing @xmath24 with @xmath73 in equation [ eqn : real ] .",
    "we immediately see that the asymptotic scalings remain unchanged ( i.e. @xmath74 and @xmath61 ) , but that the peak time changes , to @xmath75 .",
    "this makes sense , because we roughly expect the flux to beam into an angle @xmath76 .",
    "this of course overestimates the total flux and the true visible angle , because emission from the rest of the jet face is less blueshifted and therefore less bright .",
    "also note that the emission from other regions of the jet face should peak at later times , so that we expect a broader lightcurve peak for off axis viewers than on axis viewers .",
    "this broadening of the peak is seen in numerical simulations of relativistic jet hydrodynamics and emission @xcite .",
    "an upper limit on the effects of lateral spreading of the jet on the off - axis lightcurve may be obtained by noting that if in the jet comoving rest frame the emitting material is expanding laterally at speed @xmath77 , then the apparent angular size of the jet face becomes @xmath78 .",
    "then our previous discussion applies , merely replacing the constant jet angle with this spreading jet size . to bracket possible jet morphologies and evolution , for a lower bound on off - axis emission we use equation [ eqn : real ] , which has all emission coming from the jet center and no lateral spreading , and for an upper bound on off - axis emission we use equation [ eqn : real ] with @xmath24 replaced by @xmath79 , which has all emission coming from the nearest jet edge and lateral jet spreading at the speed of light .",
    "observing programs that aim to measure grb collimation using orphans will measure the rate of orphan afterglow detection and compare this to the rate of grb - triggered ( on - axis ) afterglow occurrence .",
    "optical searches for orphan afterglows naturally piggyback on top of type ia supernova searches , which repeatedly monitor fixed regions of the sky and use differential photometry to detect transient optical sources . ideally one would like to detect every afterglow occurring in the observed region , but some afterglows will be missed either because they are too faint or because the monitoring is not frequent enough to catch them .",
    "note , however , that if one can accurately estimate the efficiency at which afterglows are found , then orphan searches may be useful even if many afterglows are missed .    in this section",
    ", we estimate the number of afterglows that an observing program would detect and the properties ( such as viewing angle from the center of the jet ) of those detected afterglows .",
    "we can estimate these quantities using the simple model of off - axis emission described in the previous section .",
    "first , we give a simple analytic calculation of the detection rate , appropriate in the limit of frequent or continuous monitoring , which captures the effects of jet behavior .",
    "to determine the effects of infrequent monitoring , we then perform a monte carlo simulation of a simplified observing program .      consider a perfect orphan afterglow search capable of detecting any orphan afterglow above limiting flux @xmath80 .",
    "we would like to determine which viewing angles @xmath24 see apparent fluxes above threshold , @xmath81 , as a function of time @xmath4 . using equation [ eqn : real ] and @xmath82 , and taking @xmath83few , we see that @xmath81 for viewing angles @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is given by @xmath86\\ ] ] recall that before the break , @xmath49 and @xmath30 , while after @xmath87 we have @xmath88 and @xmath31 . to compute the effective afterglow beaming angle",
    ", we maximize equation [ eqn : genl ] with respect to time .",
    "let us call @xmath89 the time at which the visible angle is maximized . depending upon whether or not @xmath89 coincides with the break time , the @xmath85 expression becomes @xmath90^{1/2}&\\quad{{t_{\\rm max}}}={{t_{\\rm break}}}\\\\ \\left[\\frac{\\fbreak}{{{f_{\\rm lim}}}}\\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2\\mu m}\\right)^m\\right ] ^{\\mu/\\alpha}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2\\mu m-\\alpha}\\right)^{1/2 } & \\quad{{t_{\\rm max}}}\\ne{{t_{\\rm break}}}\\end{array}\\right .",
    "\\label{eqn : nojetnospread}\\ ] ]    this discussion has neglected both the finite width of the jet and the possibility of lateral spreading of the jet . including these effects as discussed in   2 gives @xmath91 where @xmath92 is defined as in equation [ eqn : nojetnospread ] .",
    "we emphasize that this is an upper limit to the visible angle , and that a more careful treatment would give a @xmath85 somewhere in between that given by equation [ eqn : nojetnospread ] and equation [ eqn : withjetandspreading ] . our previous expression for @xmath92 should underestimate off - axis emission , and so these two cases should bracket all possible jet emission .",
    "in order to proceed , we next need to define the grb properties",
    ". there are large uncertainties here , and we expect these to introduce substantial uncertainties in our estimates of the event rates . however , we argue that this will not affect our main conclusions .",
    "first we follow @xcite and @xcite in hypothesizing that the comoving rate at which grbs occur is proportional to the star formation rate , @xmath93 . for simplicity",
    "we approximate the star formation rate , as measured by @xcite , as @xmath94 with an arbitrary cutoff for @xmath95 . for the @xmath96 km / s / mpc einstein - de sitter universe that @xcite use",
    ", @xmath97 appears adequate , and correcting this to the flat @xmath98 km / s / mpc cosmology that we adopt gives instead @xmath99 .",
    "we absorb the overall normalization of @xmath93 into our total event rate , which we normalize so that the overall rate of grbs is @xmath100yr over the full sky @xcite .",
    "next we must make an assumption concerning the luminosity function of grb afterglows .",
    "for simplicity we will assume that afterglows are standard candles with absolute magnitude @xmath101 at the time of the lightcurve break .",
    "this number is chosen so that @xmath39 of well - followed grbs do not show afterglows because the afterglows are too faint at the time of observation , which we assume to be near the break time .",
    "of course , it is known that the dozen or so afterglows with measured redshifts are widely distributed in absolute magnitude , but @xmath101 is a typical value . since the effective beaming angle depends strongly on the apparent luminosity function ( c.f .",
    "equation [ eqn : nojetnospread ] ) , uncertainty here will lead to substantial uncertainty in the event rate , as we discuss below .",
    "one additional concern is the k - correction . at high frequencies ,",
    "the afterglow spectrum is expected to behave as @xmath102 @xcite , so as a function of redshift @xmath13 , @xmath103^{-\\alpha/2}$ ] .",
    "finally , we assume that all grbs have the same jet opening angle @xmath0 , the same power law indices @xmath104 and @xmath105 specified in   2 , and the same rest - frame break time @xmath106 day .",
    "note that here by rest - frame , we mean as viewed by an observer at the same redshift , so that there is a @xmath107 correction .",
    "we do not mean the plasma rest frame time , for which there is an additional @xmath108 correction relative to observer time .",
    "clearly there is a wide spread in the observed @xmath87 s and power - law indices @xmath104 for previous grbs @xcite , and this will lead to uncertainties of order a few in our final numerical results .",
    "we can now compute the expected rate of orphan afterglow detections .",
    "let us write the effective beaming ( solid ) angle as @xmath109 . with our assumption of standard candle afterglows , we need only specify the redshift distribution to obtain the afterglow luminosity function . assuming as above that the gamma - ray burst  rate is proportional to the star formation rate , we may write the observed afterglow redshift distribution as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the comoving volume element , @xmath13 is the grb redshift , and @xmath112 is a normalization constant .",
    "the k - correction is incorporated as above and we set @xmath112 as above by assuming that all on axis gamma - ray bursts are bright enough to be detected ; that is we set @xmath113 in equation [ eqn : dndz ] and integrate over redshift giving @xmath114 yr@xmath115 over the full sky .    the calculation described above",
    "elucidates the overall behavior , but neglects effects which may affect numerical predictions for the overall detection rate .",
    "for example , we have extrapolated the scaling formulas for @xmath23 to the nonrelativistic regime where the scalings break down ; fortunately we will show that the regions of low @xmath23 make a small contribution to the integral for all but the deepest surveys .",
    "we have also assumed continuous monitoring , which is certainly not the case in current sne searches . in order to take into account the effect of imperfect monitoring and to check the above analytic calculation we ran a monte carlo simulation of a simplified observing program .",
    "we define an observing program by its limiting magnitude @xmath116 ( and corresponding limiting flux @xmath80 ) , by the time between exposures of a given field @xmath117 , and by the total survey exposure ( number of yr ) . in an actual survey additional parameters and various experimental efficiencies would also be taken into account but these are not crucial for our considerations here .",
    "the observing program simulation is run for a given value of @xmath0 by distributing grbs randomly throughout the universe , proportionally to the product of comoving volume and star formation rate , and at a random viewing angle to the observer .",
    "the lightcurve is started at a random time and observed every @xmath117 days .",
    "the afterglow is considered to be detected if any of the observations find a flux above the limiting flux of the observing program . the total event rate and the distribution of detected events as a function of redshift , observing angle , etc .",
    "is thus easily found .",
    "now , all the elements are in place to calculate the detection rate and average beaming factor for a given survey .",
    "let us first consider a type ia supernova search @xcite , with limiting magnitude of @xmath71 and monitoring repeat baseline @xmath118 days .",
    "adopting an opening angle of @xmath119 @xcite our monte carlo calculation gives an expected rate of @xmath120 0.0008 deg@xmath121 yr@xmath115 if the flux is concentrated at the jet center and there is no lateral spreading , and @xmath1200.014 deg@xmath121 yr@xmath115 if lateral spreading is maximal and the flux is concentrated at the jet edge .",
    "so , taking an exposure of 10 deg@xmath122 yr , the we predict between 0.008 and 0.14 detections from previous type ia supernova surveys .",
    "we note that in the limit of very small @xmath117 the monte carlo results are close to the analytic results , which finds 3 - 5 times more events depending on jet morphology .",
    "now , the important point to note is that these numbers , besides being small , are fairly independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the reason for this should be clear . the only dependence of equation [ eqn : dndz ] on @xmath0 is the @xmath123 factor , which was the effective beaming angle as a function of redshift . since @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
    "but since the total grb rate scales like @xmath126 to hold fixed the number of observed grbs , this means that the expected number of detected orphans is also held fixed .",
    "so the non - detection of orphan afterglows is not only consistent with opening angles of @xmath127 , it is consistent with almost _ any _ opening angle .",
    "next we consider a more powerful future observing program with limiting magnitude @xmath128 , and frequent enough monitoring that our analytic estimates are accurate . here",
    "the number of predicted afterglow detections can rise above unity if many tens of square degrees are monitored .",
    "the number of expected events is shown in figure [ thetavariation ] as a function of the opening jet angle @xmath0 . for opening angles ranging from moderate ( @xmath2 ) to arbitrarily small ( @xmath129 )",
    "there is essentially no change in the predicted number of detections .",
    "note , however , that for large jet angles ( @xmath130 ) there can be a significant decrement in the predicted number of detected orphans , in part because the relativistic scalings we have employed break down , and in part because the emission begins to subtend the full sky .",
    "however , it is clear that for the angles being considered in the leading jet models , the ratio of grb detection to afterglow detection will give no information on the grb collimation .",
    "we have shown that within the framework of the leading model for the late time grb jet evolution , current optical surveys can not constrain grb beaming .",
    "part of the problem is that current surveys are too infrequent , narrow and shallow .",
    "a more basic problem is that the effective afterglow beaming angle scales as the jet angle for small ( @xmath131 ) jet angles , and so the ratio of @xmath132 can not be used to measure @xmath0 .",
    "this conclusion depends on the simple scaling laws of flux and lorentz factor that apply during the relativistic phase of the expansion . in order to see emission from large viewing angles",
    ", one must wait until the jet has become only moderately relativistic and therefore dim . in figure [ dndtheta ]",
    "we plot the distribution of viewing angles for several different limiting magnitudes .",
    "only the @xmath133 lightcurve has any sensitivity to large viewing angles , and it is still dominated by small @xmath24 . finding optical afterglows this faint or fainter will be difficult due to , for example , host galaxy domination .    absent the capability to detect emission from viewing angles near unity , measuring the grb jet angle using orphans is all but impossible .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ thetavariation ] , in which we plot the number of expected afterglow detections per year per square degree as a function of jet opening angle , for a limiting magnitude of @xmath134 . as mentioned above , there is essentially no variation in the predicted number of detections as the jet solid angle @xmath135 is varied by orders of magnitude , until nearly isotropic jets ( @xmath136 ) are reached .",
    "now , once the grb afterglow luminosity function is well measured , as should be possible with future missions such as swift or hete - ii , and once grb jet dynamics are better understood , then a prediction can be made for the expected number of afterglows any given survey can detect .",
    "a significant downward departure from this expected rate would be hard to reconcile with small jet angles , within the context of accepted models .",
    "a statistically significant detection of such a deficit would require a very deep survey expected to detect hundreds of orphans over a large region of sky .    to establish our conclusion of the difficulty of using optical afterglow searches to constrain small beaming angles , we have presented two sets of detection rates in an attempt to bracket the effects of uncertain jet morphology and evolution .",
    "we caution that our upper bound is probably not realistic because it assumes that the jet emits all of its flux as near as possible to the direction of the observer .",
    "in addition , for both the upper and lower bounds we have neglected the frequency redshift of photons received by off axis observers relative to on - axis observers .",
    "this should be taken into account for observers interested in the narrow frequency range within the optical band . for a narrow pencil beam moving along the @xmath137 axis",
    "the relative redshift of photons received by an observer at @xmath138 is @xmath139 .",
    "if the afterglow spectrum behaves as @xmath140 @xcite , then the redshift effect drives the exponent in equation 3 , which we previously found to be @xmath57 , to @xmath141 . replacing @xmath57 in our equations with @xmath142 slightly diminishes the expected number of detections by @xmath143 .",
    "were an orphan afterglow search to be performed , these corrections , as well as a detailed study of the jet evolution and emission , would be required to calculate a more accurate estimate of the expected rate .    in our calculations",
    "we have assumed particular values for the parameters describing grb afterglows .",
    "these parameters are the power law exponents @xmath104 and @xmath105 , the absolute magnitude of the on - axis afterglow at break , and the break time @xmath87 .",
    "uncertainties in these parameters will introduce uncertainties in the overall rates .",
    "for example , changing @xmath104 from 2.4 to 1.8 increases the detection rate by a factor of @xmath144 .",
    "similarly , changing the absolute magnitude at break from @xmath101 to @xmath145 ( an increase in luminosity by a factor of 40 ) , increases the overall detection rate by a factor of 4 - 5 , as expected from equation [ eqn : nojetnospread ] .",
    "changing @xmath87 does not affect our calculations for continuous monitoring , but can change the detection efficiency depending upon the monitoring time . in the limit of small efficiency",
    "the rate should scale as @xmath87 .",
    "most importantly , the constancy of the calculated detection rate with respect to the jet opening angle remains valid for @xmath146 .",
    "one caveat to our estimate for the orphan afterglow detection rate and to our constraint on the observed ratio of orphans to grbs is the possibility of processes that lead to weakly beamed optical emission while remaining consistent with the good agreement between the expected and observed power law decay and break of the late time afterglow .",
    "for example the grb central engine might emit , coincident with an ultra - relativistic jet , a moderately relativistic spherical shell that leads to isotropic optical emission .",
    "this might occur in central engine models where rotation leads to small baryon contamination and ultra - relativistic flow along the rotation axis , but also to `` dirtier '' , moderately relativistic flow away from the rotation axis ( e.g. in the collapsar model , * ? ? ?",
    "such an isotropic component , if bright enough to be detected off - axis but faint enough to avoid on - axis detection , would clearly confound our analysis and allow direct measurement of grb collimation .",
    "on the other hand , it seems unlikely that we have underestimated the off axis optical emission from the jet itself , because this estimate derives principally from simple relativistic kinematics .",
    "similarly , the upper limit to the degree of angular spreading in the jet comes from the maximal assumption that the lateral expansion velocity is @xmath147 in the jet comoving rest frame .",
    "recent numerical hydrodynamics simulations @xcite of the relativistic jet dynamics appear to indicate that the afterglow emission is indeed more tightly beamed in the forward direction than we have assumed , suggesting that our calculations neglecting spreading are more realistic than our calculations including lateral spreading .",
    "finally , we note that radio afterglows are not subject to the analysis presented here .",
    "they do not decay as steeply as their higher frequency counterparts and remain visible until the afterglow emission is effectively isotropic . @xcite",
    "have proposed that a full - sky survey sensitive to 0.1 mjy could legitimately test the jet model of grb emission .",
    "it appears that this may be the best way to implement @xcite suggestion of using burst - less afterglows to measure the grb jet angle .",

    "<S> if gamma - ray burst ( grb ) emission is strongly collimated then grbs occur throughout the universe at a rate much higher than is detected . since the emission from the optical afterglow </S>",
    "<S> is thought to be more isotropic than the gamma - ray emission , it has been hypothesized that a search for orphan afterglows ( those without the triggering grb ) would allow strong constraints to be placed on the degree of grb collimation . </S>",
    "<S> we show here that , within the context of leading models of grb jet evolution , measurement of the grb beaming angle @xmath0 using optical orphan searches is extremely difficult , perhaps impossible in practice . </S>",
    "<S> this is because in the leading model of grb jets , the effective afterglow beaming angle scales with the jet angle , @xmath1 for small angles , and so the ratio of detected orphan afterglows to grbs is independent of the jet opening angle . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the number of expected afterglow detections is the same for moderate jet angles ( @xmath2 ) as for arbitrarily small jet angles ( @xmath3 ) . for nearly isotropic grb geometry , or for radio afterglow searches </S>",
    "<S> in which the jet has become non - relativistic , the ratio of afterglows to grbs may give information on collimation . </S>",
    "<S> however , using a simple model we estimate the expected number of orphan detections in current supernova surveys , and find this number to be less than one , for all jet opening angles . even for future supernova surveys , the small detection rate and lack of dependence on collimation angle appear to ruin the prospects of determining grb beaming by this method . </S>",
    "<S> radio searches may provide the best hope to find the missing orphans . </S>"
