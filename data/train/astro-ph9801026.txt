    "in two recent papers we have described results from the first phase of a survey for high - redshift , radio - loud quasars ( hook et al 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "our approach involves the optical identification of flat spectrum radio sources and the spectroscopic follow - up of the red stellar identifications .",
    "this approach exploits the observation that quasars at high redshift have redder optical colours than their low - redshift counterparts due to absorption by intervening hi ( see figure 1 in hook _",
    "1995 ) .",
    "our aim is to study the evolution of the quasar population at high redshift , using a well - defined , statistically complete sample .",
    "whilst radio - loud quasars are only a small subset of the quasar population , the selection of radio - loud quasars is less prone to selection effects than optical samples , since the spectral energy distribution of radio sources is smooth and radio emission is unaffected by either intrinsic or extrinsic absorption due to dust . see fall & pei ( 1995 ) for a discussion of how dust within intervening galaxies may affect the observed evolution in optically selected samples of quasars .",
    "our work complements the numerous investigations into the redshift evolution of the space density of radio quiet quasars ( eg .",
    "hall et al . , 1996 ; hawkins & veron , 1996 ; irwin , mcmahon & hazard , 1991 ; kennefick et al . , 1996 ; schmidt , schneider & gunn , 1995 ; warren , hewett & osmer , 1995 ) .",
    "our earlier work was restricted to sources that were detected on apm scans of poss - i plates and hence was incomplete for optically fainter quasars . since it is our aim to determine the evolution of the space density of high - redshift quasars independent of optical selection effects , we have now begun ccd imaging of sources that were not detected on the poss - i plates .    throughout this paper",
    "we have assumed cosmological constants of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the parent radio sample used in this study consists of @xmath171600 flat - spectrum ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) radio sources with @xmath20 studied with the vla by patnaik _",
    "initial optical identification of the radio sources was carried out using the automated plate measurement ( apm ) facility at cambridge , u.k .",
    "further details of this program and the procedures can be found in hook et al ( 1995,1996 ) .    for the second phase of the survey , we have concentrated on the radio sources with no apm / poss - i identification within a search radius of @xmath21 .",
    "the area studied lies in the region with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , ( @xmath24 for @xmath25 to @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath26 to @xmath28 ) , an area of 1.27sr containing 526 sources .",
    "there were 82 blank fields with @xmath20 in this region , after our earlier work .",
    "of these , 16 had redshifts from other sources prior to the start of this project ( ned , vermeulen et al 1996 , vermeulen , private communication ) .",
    "an unbiased sub - sample of 38 of the remaining 66 sources were imaged during one week ( 29 may to 4 june 1995 ) at the prime focus of 2.5 m isaac newton telescope , la palma .",
    "we used the @xmath29 thinned tek ccd with a projected pixel size of @xmath30 .",
    "mould b and r filters ( the ` kitt - peak ' set at la palma ) were used with 300s exposures in r and 600s exposures in b , and typically reaching limiting magnitudes of @xmath31mag , @xmath32mag .",
    "photometric calibration was carried out using observations of the photometric standard star fields from landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "the data were reduced using standard procedures with the iraf software environment including photometry using the daophot package ( stetson , 1990 ) .",
    "after this int imaging , 10 sources are still blank in the r band , i.e. they had no optical counterpart within a radius of @xmath33 ( k band imaging of these sources is being obtained ) . a colour magnitude diagram for the 28 objects detected in r",
    "is shown in figure  [ colmag ] .    thus after the int imaging the fraction of sources observed",
    "is @xmath34 . to estimate in a fair manner the effective area observed , we include the same fraction ( 9 out of 16 ) of the sources with previously known redshifts .",
    "the effective area is then @xmath35 .",
    "scaling from the original 526 radio sources in 1.27sr , there are 302 radio sources in this sub - area of which all but 10 ( 3% ) are now identified .",
    "we have selected for spectroscopic followup a complete sample of the 12 stellar identifications with @xmath36 .",
    "redshifts became available for 3 of the 12 selected objects prior to the spectroscopic phase of this study ( vermeulen , private communication ) including the @xmath37 quasar gb1239 + 3736 ( vermeulen et al 1996 ) .",
    "7 of the other 9 were observed at either the shane 3 m telescope at lick observatory or the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) , la palma .",
    "the lick spectra were obtained using the kast double spectrograph at lowest resolution covering the range @xmath38 .",
    "the wht spectra were obtained using the red arm of the isis double spectrograph .",
    "a 158 l / mm grating and a thinned tek ccd with 1024x1024 @xmath39 pixels was used , giving a useful wavelength range of 5970 - 8940  at 2.9  per pixel .    of the 7 objects",
    "observed , 1 still has an inconclusive spectrum .",
    "another ( gb1712 + 493 ) has a recently - published redshift of 1.552 ( falco , kochaneck & muoz 1997 ) , consistent with the single emission line seen in our spectrum being identified with mgii .",
    "the spectrum of one other object also shows a single broad emission line ( probably also mgii ) which we can rule out as being ly-@xmath40 at @xmath2 by the lack of other strong emission lines or ly-@xmath40 forest absorption . here",
    "we give details for two objects , gb1428 + 4217 and gb1713 + 2148 , which were identified as high - redshift quasars .",

    "the peak of the blue edge occurs at 6974 .",
    "the correction for instrumental resolution effects is @xmath42 , so assuming a value of 6971  for the ly-@xmath40 edge gives a redshift of 4.734 .",
    "it is quite common to observe velocity shifts between the emission lines in quasars and this redshift difference corresponds to a blue shift of 1420 km / sec of civ with respect to ly-@xmath40 .",

    "gb1428 + 4217 is notable in that it is amongst the lowest equivalent width objects .",
    "this is consistent with a scenario in which the continuum region is beamed .",
    "in addition , in contrast to the other three radio loud @xmath2 quasars , the emission lines are relatively broad .    after our int and wht observations 2 of the 38 poss - apm blank fields are quasars with @xmath2 and 23 are ruled out as being at @xmath2 quasars ( either based on spectroscopic observations , or deduced from their blue @xmath46 colours or extended appearance on the ccd images ) .",
