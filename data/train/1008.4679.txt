    "the resemblance of the two different spectra may be attributed to following reasons . in the monolayer - bilayer junction ,",
    "when a low - energy electron travels from the monolayer to the bilayer , it feels as if @xmath3 sites suddenly disappear at the boundary , because in bilayer , @xmath67 is coupled with @xmath68 to make high - energy states away from @xmath148 .",
    "this effect can be roughly modeled by on - site potential at @xmath3 sites at the boundary . for an electron coming from bilayer side , on the other hand , @xmath67 site which was absent in the low - energy spectrum suddenly resumes at the beginning of the monolayer region , while @xmath66 just smoothly connects to @xmath2 .",
    "this should roughly correspond to some condition for @xmath67 sites , with @xmath66 left intact .",
    "energy gaps opening at crossing points are due to finite hybridization between monolayer and bilayer states .    as another remark",
    ", we observe that energy levels of zz1 pass through every crossing point of terminated bilayer and monolayer levels .",
    "this occurs when an eigenfunction of zz1 happens to have a node on the on - site potential sites , because such a state is also an eigenstate when on - site potential is present .",
    "therefore the wavefunction of zz1 becomes identical with that of the terminated system at each crossing point .",
    "similar analysis is also available in boundary zz2 .",
    "figure [ fig_crossing_zig2 ] compares the energy spectrum of zz2 , and that of separated system with on - site potential on @xmath3 sites illustrated in the top panel .",
    "the boundary condition becomes @xmath146 for monolayer and @xmath149 for bilayer .",
    "since the low - energy spectrum of the bilayer is dominated by @xmath138 and @xmath150 , the second condition @xmath151 should give a weaker effect compared to @xmath152 in zz1 and thus leads to better coupling between the monolayer and bilayer region . in fig .",
    "[ fig_crossing_zig2 ] , indeed , the mixing between terminated levels looks stronger than in zz1 , resulting in the monotonic dependence rather than non - monotonic behavior in zz1 .",

    "[ fig_crossing_zig1 ] .",

    "there , the wavefunction of layer 1 smoothly connects at the boundary as argued in sec .",
    "[ sec_flat ] , while generally not in other cases .",
    "the point ( e ) is exactly at the crossing point of terminated levels .",
    "there , the wave function indeed has a node at the interface for the @xmath3 and @xmath153 components and thus can be an eigenstate of the separate monolayer and bilayer . at the local band minimum ( d ) , the wave function does not have special features in contrast to @xmath121 .    in the energy spectrum , the region between ( a ) and ( b ) and between ( e ) and ( f ) have slope close to that of the terminated bilayer , while the region between ( b ) and ( d ) has slope close to that of the terminated monolayer .",

    "the vertical scale is shared with the corresponding energy spectrum at left .",
