    "theory and observations are merging toward consensus that core - collapse supernova explosions are intrinsically asymmetric , even if the progenitor had an initially symmetric configuration .",
    "recent three - dimensional simulations show that strong dynamical interactions between the various burning shells can lead to large asymmetries in the progenitors , independent of the symmetry of the explosion @xcite . nor is the explosion itself likely to be spherical , with convective instabilities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and instabilities at the accretion shock ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) all possibly acting to create asymmetries .",
    "it is further anticipated that such asymmetries may hold the key to the core - collapse explosion mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they will be manifested not only in the distributions of the ejecta mass and velocity , but also in the recoil of the nascent neutron star , which is observed with measured space velocities of up to 1000 - 1500 km / s @xcite .",
    "simulations show that a neutron star kick that has a purely hydrodynamic origin can balance the total momentum of the anisotropic component , and is expected in the direction opposite the fastest shock expansion @xcite .",
    "observations of core - collapse supernovae indicate a significant degree of explosion asymmetry via measurements such as time - dependent polarization changes or doppler velocities @xcite , but explosion asymmetries are also revealed in sufficiently young supernova remnants ( snrs ) through their shock - heated ejecta .",
    "the most detailed view so far available of the ejecta in a young core - collapse snr is provided by cassiopeia a , which at 330 years is the penultimate of the known galactic supernova remnants .",
    "its reverse shock has already progressed deeply into the explosively produced nucleosynthesis products , aided by the strong presupernova mass loss incurred by its progenitor through the likely action of a binary companion @xcite .",
    "that cas a was produced by an asymmetric explosion is by now well - established , and most recently by light echo observations which sample the explosion hundreds of years after the fact in different directions .",
    "these show variations in the ejecta velocities of @xmath3 km / s ( rest et al .",
    "chandra x - ray observations have also played an important role in revealing the complexity of cas a s x - ray emitting ejecta .",
    "the x - ray emitting si ejecta show a bipolar structure with jet - like features @xcite similar to that seen in optical ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and infrared emission @xcite .",
    "the x - ray ejecta spectra reveal the imprint of roughly a factor of two asymmetries in the deposition of explosion energy around the remnant @xcite , similar to the distribution of kinetic energies and positions of fast moving optical knots @xcite .",
    "early chandra observations identified regions dominated by emission from fe ejecta well outside the projected location of si emission that were proposed to be sites of overturn between the nucleosynthesis layers @xcite . this conclusion is apparently supported by the x - ray doppler measurements showing higher velocities of fe compared to si @xcite . more recently",
    ", the dynamical structure of the ejecta has been inferred in remarkable detail by the multi - wavelength ( x - ray , optical , infrared ) doppler - shift maps compiled by @xcite .",
    "these show the inner ejecta to be unshocked and in a flattened distribution ( [ si ii ] ) , outlying matter to be arranged in rings on a spherical surface ( [ ar ii ] , [ ne ii ] ) , and outflows emerging out of the surface of the remnant ( fe ejecta , jet , and counterjet ) .",
    "their detailed analysis shows that the outflows of x - ray emitting fe ejecta are not material mixed outwards from overturning of the ejecta layers , but rather , material that has pushed through the overlying ejecta and is now encircled by rings of material from outlying nucleosynthesis layers .",
    "large - scale studies of the x - ray emission in cas a have already been undertaken by @xcite and @xcite , but these focus on the properties of the nonthermal emission .",
    "the most comprehensive accounting of the x - ray emitting ejecta in cas a to date was carried out by @xcite , who used xmm - newton ccd observations to examine 225 regions of fixed 20@xmath0 size across cas a @xcite .",
    "they fitted a two - component thermal model throughout to represent hot shocked circumstellar material plus cooler shocked ejecta , and inferred a total ejecta mass of 2.2 m@xmath4 .",
    "they interpret the fe k emission as forming a bipolar double cone that is associated with ejecta bullets that have broken beyond the forward shock .",
    "a detailed accounting of the x - ray emitting ejecta on fine angular scales was one of the primary goals of a 1 ms chandra observation of cassiopeia a that was obtained in 2004 , and is the subject of this paper .",
    "our spectral survey includes over 6000 spectral regions extracted on 2.5 - 10@xmath0 angular scales .",
    "it is distinguished from previous chandra studies of the ejecta in cas a , which have relied either on spectral imaging or the detailed spectral analysis of a relatively small number of regions .",
    "we are able to cover a larger area of the remnant with much higher sensitivity and angular resolution than was available to @xcite .",
    "in particular , we are able to show the distribution of the x - ray emitting fe ejecta in detail .",
    "the fe ejecta , being produced just outside the collapsing core of the supernova , provide valuable clues to understand important details of the explosion , including the recoil of the ejecta with the neutron star .",
    "we interpret the spectra in the context of the hydrodynamical models applied by us previously to cas a @xcite .",
    "cas a particularly lends itself to quantitative analysis by virtue of its well - constrained age @xcite and distance @xcite .",
    "recent one - dimensional hydrodynamical models for the interaction of the remnant with a circumstellar wind medium indicate that the reverse shock in cas a has already interacted with a significant fraction of the ejecta @xcite .",
    "@xcite apply their models directly to chandra x - ray spectra , and also infer that there is very little of the unshocked ejecta remaining .",
    "thus a large fraction of the ejecta in cas a are accessible to x - ray observations .",
    "the exceptions are the small amount of ejecta that have not yet been shocked , ejecta at very low densities ( which we will discuss later ) , any ejecta that might have been subject to rapid cooling by thermal instability , and and ejecta of very high density that have been shocked to lower temperatures and thus emit at longer wavelengths as optical knots ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : section 2 gives an overview of the analysis procedure , with explanations as to the spectral grid and background , and most importantly how the spectra were organized according to the fitting model required .",
    "we then proceed to discuss the results , from maps for the remnant as a whole to a few observations about properties of the forward shock - dominated regions , and then of the ejecta .",
    "section 3 discusses issues concerning the models and the refinements that have been made for this work compared to previous work .",
    "section 4 then presents the results of the mass calculation and issues connected to it , such as the presence of unshocked ejecta and implications for the neutron star kick .",
    "we use the 1 ms advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) observation obtained by the chandra x - ray observatory in february and may 2004 ( one of the first chandra vlp , or very long project , observations ) .",
    "this observation is described by @xcite .",
    "its most salient features are that it was obtained in nine observation segments ( obsids ) and in graded mode , wherein the ccd detection events are characterized onboard the spacecraft before telemetry .",
    "it was necessary to use graded mode to reduce the telemetry load , due to the high source count rate ( the observation accumulated some 280 million photon events in 980 ks ) .",
    "the main disadvantage of using graded mode is that detailed corrections of detector problems such as pulse pile up are not possible .",
    "the data were processed with caldb version 3.2.2 .    in this section ,",
    "we outline the analysis procedure , which includes definition of the spectral grid , considerations for the subtraction of the background , the classification of forward shock and ejecta - dominated spectra , the selection of appropriate spectral models , and the results of the fitting .",
    "to carry out our spectral survey of the ejecta in cas a , we define a grid of 10@xmath0 boxes across the entire supernova remnant ( snr ) , optionally subdividing by factors of two down to 2.5@xmath0 depending on the number of counts .",
    "the regions are thus square or rectangular with sides of length 2.5 , 5 , or 10@xmath0 .",
    "we excluded the regions dominated by the central compact object , and a few other regions with low numbers of counts .",
    "this gave us 6202 spectra for analysis .",
    "although this is a very large number , the data would have readily allowed at least a factor of two finer grid sizes down to nearly the chandra angular resolution in some regions .",
    "this being the first attempt at an analysis of the complex thermal emission on such a fine angular scale , we tried to keep the number of grid regions relatively tractable .    each spectrum",
    "was then extracted individually from all nine obsids comprising the ms observation , and the corresponding individual photon redistribution matrices and effective area files computed .",
    "the individual spectra were then added , and the individual response files weighted and added , to obtain the final spectral and response files for each grid region .",
    "the pulse - height spectra were further binned to yield a minimum of 25 counts per bin to apply gaussian statistics .",
    "the filamentary and knotty characteristics of cas a s x - ray emission , its high surface brightness , and the excellence of the chandra mirrors , result in pulse pile - up at the brightest ejecta knots .",
    "pulse pile - up can produce spurious line features , for example , with energies that correspond roughly to the summed energy of the si and/or s he @xmath2 blends that are so prominent in cas a. pile - up of continuum photons will also skew the spectral shape and result in higher fitted temperatures .",
    "a detailed correction for pulse pile - up can not be performed for these graded mode data , and we made no attempt to account for these effects for the thousands of spectra examined here .",
    "we can , however , estimate qualitatively the number of our spectra for which pile - up is a significant problem . for the _ vpshock _",
    "fits described later ( in section 2.3 ) , we consider the distribution of the fitted temperature against the counts per pixel for each spectrum .",
    "the average fitted temperature shows a clear trend of increasing for spectra with more than about 6000 counts / pixel in 980 ks .",
    "for the 25 regions with the highest count / pixel ratios ( @xmath5 6000 counts / pixel ) , the average fitted temperature is 2.25 kev , compared to an average of 1.7 kev for the remaining spectra .",
    "inspection of these spectra show the problems in fitting the line emission described above ; these problems are not apparent for lower count - rate spectra .",
    "since the pile - up occurs noticeably in only a limited number of regions ( @xmath625 ) , we expect that its uncorrected effect on the total mass is not large .",
    "the off - source regions outside the snr show a line - rich spectrum similar to that of the snr itself . the background is thus dominated by the bright source spectrum due to scattering by intervening dust , the ccd readout , and to a lesser extent , the wings of the mirror point spread function .",
    "dust scattering has been shown to be significant for cas a based on rosat and einstein observations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since the source spectrum , and hence the background , varies both in form and brightness around the remnant , we extract 16 separate background spectra by subdividing a @xmath7 thick , @xmath8 radius circular shell surrounding the remnant so that each segment covers roughly 20 degrees in azimuth .",
    "we then assign a background spectrum for each source spectrum based on the source region s azimuthal position angle . where the source extends beyond the background extraction radius , near the northeast `` jet '' and its southwest counterpart , we use the sum of the two nearest background regions to either side .",
    "we choose to subtract the background from the source spectrum rather than to fit a model to each background spectrum . a model for the background would have to include a thermal component for the scattered source spectrum , whose normalization would inevitably be difficult to constrain .",
    "the normalization for the particle background component is well - constrained by the spectrum at high energies , but the effect of scaling the scattered thermal background in the same way as the particle background is similar to simply subtracting the total background .",
    "simple subtraction of the off - source background means that the background is generally underestimated , and by different amounts depending on the photon energy and the dominant scattering process .",
    "the precise determination of the background is thus a sophisticated problem that is beyond the scope of our study .",
    "the ejecta survey which is the focus of our efforts will be less sensitive to the precise background subtraction because most of the ejecta regions are bright , with strong line emission ; the subtleties of the background subtraction are less important here than for inferences about the origin of weak lines .        to provide a consistent spectral characterization of the entire remnant , we fit to every spectrum in our grid a single - component plane - parallel shock model with variable element abundances ( xspec model _ vpshock _ ; borkowski et al .",
    "2001 ) modified by interstellar absorption ( xspec model _",
    "wabs _ ; morrison & mccammon , 1983 ) .",
    "the _ vpshock _ model incorporates ionization ages from zero up to a fitted maximum value . in previous work @xcite , we had used simple nonequilibrium ionization ( nei ) models characterized by a single temperature and ionization age , but there the extraction regions were generally about 3@xmath0 and the exposure time only 50 ks .",
    "we find that for the much longer exposure time of these data , and the sometimes larger extraction regions , such models are no longer acceptable .",
    "because most of the regions have ejecta - dominated spectra , we have not included any elements lighter than o in the model , taking o to be the primary source of the continuum in the manner of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the abundances of elements heavier than o are generally varied ( with ni linked to fe , ca to ar , and sometimes ar to s ) , while o is held fixed at the solar value , using the solar abundances of @xcite .",
    "the redshift is allowed to vary to either positive or negative values , given that the ejecta in cas a have significant bulk motions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is generally driven by the fe l emission and the strong si blend . given that there may be calibration problems near si ( see the discussion in delaney et al .",
    "2010 ) , we consider the fitting of the redshift more as an aid to achieving good fits rather than a reliable measure of the actual line - of - sight velocity .",
    "the fitted redshift does , however , reproduce the gross features of the bulk motion as measured by other means .",
    "a gaussian smoothing scale for the spectrum was also fitted , given that the observed strong spectral lines are generally broad because of bulk motions .",
    "while we do not present errors for the fitted parameters here , these were computed for key parameters .",
    "we have found that this is a necessary step to optimize finding the true minima : the @xmath9 terrain is generally rather rugged for these fits .",
    "the redshift and ionization age in particular are prone to settle at secondary minima , as might be expected , considering that these parameters both have a strong effect on the energies of the strong line features .",
    "here we note some of the general features of these results based on images shown in figure 1 , where fitted model parameters such as temperature , ionization age , and various element abundances are shown for each spectral region .",
    "histograms and a scatter plot for the fitted temperatures and ionization ages are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the column density increases systematically to the west by about a factor of 2 or more and reaches a maximum at the western extremity of the remnant .",
    "this is entirely consistent with previous work @xcite .",
    "there are also smaller regions in the center with significant localized column density enhancements of about 50% .",
    "the temperature distribution has two peaks , which are seen most clearly in the histogram in figure 2 .",
    "the temperature map shows that the lower peak is associated with ejecta - dominated , line - emitting regions and the higher with the forward shock - dominated regions that were identified in previous work @xcite .",
    "( we will discuss the forward shock in the following section . ) the ionization age , by contrast , is remarkably narrowly distributed overall , though coherent regions with high ionization ages can be identified . in the western half of the remnant , these high ionization regions appear to be associated with the forward shock .",
    "the highest ionization ages are found in the east , however , and there they are clearly associated with fe - enriched ejecta , as is apparent from comparing the ionization age and fe abundance maps shown in figure 1 .    we will focus our attention primarily on the abundance maps for fe and si , although such maps are also shown for all the elements for which we fitted the abundances .",
    "the maps for s and ar are on the whole similar to that of si .",
    "the abundance maps for si and fe are distinctly different , but both feature three main lobes of ejecta located north , east , and west .",
    "the si is also extended to the northeast along the northeast ejecta `` jet '' , while fe is particularly distinct in the eastern region compared to the si , and shows its highest enhancement in the outermost parts of this region . in general",
    ", the abundance maps we obtain are strongly reminiscent of the corresponding line images shown by @xcite and @xcite , and also resemble the less detailed abundance maps obtained by @xcite .",
    "those authors had previously noted that the line emission and element abundance patterns for si , s , ar , and ca in cas a are similar to each other .",
    "the ne and mg maps have a distinct character in that they do not show any prominent morphological characteristics aside from a brightening at the western end of the remnant .",
    "one must be cautious to interpret those results , however , as the line emissions of ne and mg fall in complicated parts of the spectrum , and the fitted abundances of these elements may be correlated with parameters such as the ionization age , which shows similar distribution patterns in the west , and the column density , which is very high in that region .",
    "it is clear , however , that ne and mg both show a strikingly different morphology to si , s , and ar , or to fe , and are much more similar to each other than to any of the other elements .",
    "broadly speaking , the distinctions between ejecta- and fs - dominated regions in cas a are readily apparent , with differences in temperature , ionization age , and element abundances . to carry out a survey of the ejecta mass , however ,",
    "we must either model both the ejecta and csm components for each spectrum or else accurately identify the specific regions where the reverse - shocked ejecta make the dominant contribution to the emission . given the scope of the spectral analysis , we have adopted the latter approach .",
    "multi - component fits can be difficult to constrain reliably , particularly if one of the components is relatively weak , and thus would require more individual attention than is feasible for a sample of thousands .",
    "consequently , our next aim is to identify and eliminate regions whose spectra can be completely associated with the forward shock .",
    "we evaluate the presence of thermal emission associated with the forward shock by fitting a second set of plane - parallel shock models to every spectrum , but this time with element abundances appropriate for the csm .",
    "the optically emitting quasi - stationary flocculi ( qsfs ) in cas a are understood to be circumstellar mass loss from the progenitor .",
    "while abundance measurements for qsfs are limited to a small number of knots , these generally show an order of magnitude enhancement of n and sometimes also of he @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations for the presupernova composition are also given by @xcite , where the models allow the elements h , he , and n , all apparently present in cas a , to exist simultaneously at a narrow temperature range near log t ( 10@xmath10 k ) = -1.5 ( their figure 7.6 ) . at that temperature",
    "the abundance of he is 3 times the solar value relative to h by number , and that of n about 15 times the solar value .",
    "as these abundances for he and n are broadly consistent with the observational measurements , we proceed to adopt them for our fits , along with solar values for the remaining elements , as representative csm element abundances .",
    "about 1209 regions gave reasonably good fitting results ( @xmath11 ) with the @xmath12 model and these qsf element abundances , and are thus assigned to the forward shock .",
    "they are distributed mainly in the remnant s outer rim and southwest interior , as would be expected based on the 4 - 6 kev x - ray continuum image that highlights the forward - shocked regions @xcite .",
    "their average temperature is 2.2 kev , and their ionization ages are rather narrowly distributed with an average value of @xmath13 @xmath14s .",
    "these values can be assessed in the context of the models of @xcite , which give the current density of the csm at the forward shock at about 1.5 - 2 @xmath14 .",
    "considering the @xmath15 dependence of the circumstellar density , the forward shock will have encountered much denser material in the past and the present - day ionization state of the forward shocked material is expected to be relatively advanced .",
    "the models give values of the ionization age in the @xmath16 @xmath14 s range , approaching @xmath17 @xmath14s ; they also indicate that gas is rather hot , with temperatures from 2.5 - 4 kev .",
    "this is reasonably close to the average values of the temperature and ionization age that we find in our region , though the fitted spectra do nt show as broad a range in ionization age as is predicted .",
    "to the forward - shock regions identified solely by the thermal emission model above , we must also add those that have a strong nonthermal contribution .",
    "to identify these , we devise a rough diagnostic for the smoothness of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "we bin each background - subtracted spectrum at each significant line feature and continuum interval ( some of these cover only a narrow energy range ) , compute the ratio of counts for each major line feature relative to counts in an adjacent continuum bin , and take the sum of these ratios for all the line features .",
    "the distribution of this quantity for all the spectra has two overlapping peaks ; we take the spectra associated with the lower peak ( corresponding to weak lines in the spectrum ) and perform further fits with a composite plane - parallel pshock plus power - law model . for a cutoff in @xmath18 for these fits ,",
    "we associate 206 additional regions with the forward shock , giving a total of 1415 regions with spectra that are consistent with emission that can be associated with the forward shock alone .",
    "figure 3 summarizes the distribution and spectral characteristics of the forward shock regions .",
    "their locations echo the 4 - 6 kev continuum maps shown by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as already noted , their temperatures and most especially their ionization ages are rather narrowly distributed , more so than for the sample as a whole . from the figure ,",
    "the peaks in the distributions correspond roughly to kt = 2.2 kev and log ( n@xmath19 t ) = 11.25 , or n@xmath20",
    "t = 1.8e11 @xmath14s .",
    "these regions will not be considered further here as we focus our study on the ejecta hereafter .",
    "we will undertake a detailed consideration of the thermal emission associated with the forward shock in subsequent work .",
    "we associate with ejecta the remaining , more than 4000 , regions that are inconsistent with forward shocked material . for these regions ,",
    "the basic spectral model is the simple one - component plane - parallel shock that has already been presented and discussed .",
    "as noted above , we take the view that , for the ejecta sample as a whole , it is justifiable to assume sufficient ejecta dominance to neglect the forward shock component .",
    "representative examples of all the various types of spectra seen in cas a are shown in figure 5 .",
    "for some ejecta regions , the one - component spectral model is clearly inadequate to describe the ejecta emission in that it fails to account for the fe k blend .",
    "this has already been noted by @xcite .",
    "while there may be significant deficiencies in the atomic data that are used for the thermal emission models , particularly in the nonequilibrium ionization case , these can not explain so large an effect as we see . in some cases , a strong fe k",
    "blend is completely unaccounted for by the model , which otherwise characterizes the spectrum well .",
    "given the strong chemical inhomogeneities seen and expected in core - collapse supernova remnants , it is plausible that fe - rich ejecta could be superposed along a given line of sight with ejecta of more normal composition , and that each could have distinct plasma conditions as well as abundances .",
    "moreover , nucleosynthesis models predict the formation of nearly pure fe ejecta by @xmath2-rich freeze - out during complete si burning ; this is in addition to ejecta composed of a range of elements from si and fe formed by incomplete si - burning .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have reported the presence of highly enriched fe ejecta in the southeastern region of cas a , with one region particularly appearing to be a``pure fe '' cloud .",
    "we take another look at this region using the 1 ms observation .",
    "figure 4 shows a portion of the southeastern region of cas a and the roughly 2.5@xmath0 extraction region that we use for this cloud ; this is smaller than the region used by hwang et al .",
    "the background is taken locally from the vicinity of the source region , and we compared results using three different background spectra . the background was modeled in this case , rather than subtracted , and the model included in the fit to the unbinned , unsubtracted source spectrum .",
    "the results for all three background subtractions gave fitted fe / si abundance ratios that are enhanced over the solar values by factors of 10 - 20 by number , or factors of 20 - 40 by mass .",
    "the right panel of figure 4 shows the fit giving the highest fe / si ratio .",
    "note the absence of recognizable emission from s or ar , and the weakness of the si emission ; the emission lines at energies above 7 kev are of h - like fe .",
    "these results demonstrate that there is emission in cas a that is plausibly associated with pure fe .    for a subset of 700 regions with the strongest fe line emission and the poorest fits in the fe k band , we tested two options for the added component representing either shocked circumstellar medium or pure fe and ni ejecta . for the former ,",
    "we take a plane - parallel shock with csm abundances and the average temperature ( 2.2 kev ) and ionization age ( @xmath21 @xmath14s ) obtained for the forward shock regions , all as described above . for the latter",
    ", we found that a simple nonequilibrium ionization component , with a single value of the ionization age was sufficient , with the temperature fixed at 1.95 kev and the ionization age fixed at @xmath22 @xmath14s .",
    "these values are representative of the most enriched fe ejecta spectra , such as those studied by @xcite ; the fits , however , are not strongly sensitive to the exact values used so long as they are of this approximate magnitude .",
    "we fix the parameters of the second component whenever possible because the limited spectral resolution makes it very difficult , even at these exceptionally high levels of signal - to - noise , to constrain both model components independently .",
    "as before , errors were calculated for key parameters to help ensure finding the true minimum in @xmath9 .",
    "only one of these 700 ejecta+csm fits gave @xmath23 in the 6 - 7 kev fe k region , leading us to conclude that the presence of a forward shock component can not explain the strong fe k emission in these spectra . on the other hand",
    ", a majority of the _ vpshock_+nei fits did give acceptable @xmath9 values in the 6 - 7 band , although the improvement was sometimes due to a better match to the continuum rather than the line emission .",
    "an example is shown in the final two panel rows of figure 5 , where the same spectrum is shown with the original single - component _ vpshock _ fit , a two component _ vpshock _ fit for normal ejecta and shocked csm , and finally a two ejecta - component fit where the added ejecta component is taken to be pure fe ( and ni ) .    on a broader scale , we identify 2982 spectra where a composite ejecta model providing additional fe emission may be needed , based on a fitted fe abundance for the basic single - component model that is above 0.3 solar .",
    "a composite model is implemented in cases where the @xmath9 per degree of freedom @xmath24 for the single - component model is greater than a user defined threshold .",
    "we focus hereafter only on two component models where the second ( nei ) ejecta component corresponds to pure fe .",
    "the three panels of figure 6 show examples of the fe mass distribution in the second , `` pure '' , fe component for values of the threshold for @xmath25 of 1.1 , 1.2 , and 1.3 . in the idealized case that fit errors are normally distributed , the model linear , and variances known such that @xmath26 is well defined @xcite",
    ", these values would correspond to probabilites of 0.1 , 0.01 , and 0.001 , respectively , that the correct model had been fitted . independently of the selected threshold value , the spatial distribution of the added fe distribution is seen to retain its main morphological features .",
    "in this section we provide an overview of our models for the evolution of cas a. these are treated in a manner similar to that in @xcite and @xcite , for a remnant with an ejecta density profile with a constant core and a n=10 power - law envelope ( after matzner & mckee 1999 ) , expanding into a circumstellar wind ( density @xmath27 ) . we discuss modifications here .",
    "we modify the models to accommodate snr expansion into a stellar wind `` bubble '' as presented and discussed in @xcite .",
    "the chief motivation for this involves the interpretation of infra - red light echoes associated with cas a as reprocessed shock breakout radiation @xcite .",
    "this radiation is concentrated in the uv - euv spectral region , and would be strongly absorbed in photoionizing any intervening neutral gas , which presumably would be a relic of the red supergiant presupernova stellar wind .",
    "most of this opacity would lie close to the progenitor , and so a small `` bubble '' in the circumstellar medium could allow the breakout radiation to escape and illuminate the surrounding dust .",
    "this is especially true if the exploding progenitor were compact , and the duration of breakout radiation short , as a longer shock breakout would probably produce sufficient photoionization to burn its way through the surrounding wind .",
    "we note that the iib prototype sn 1993j appears to have had dense wind very close to the progenitor since it was detected in x - rays a few days after explosion @xcite .",
    "while cas a resembles sn 1993j in many other respects , it would appear to differ on this point .",
    "another update corrects the motion of the reverse shock . in previous work",
    "we have used a model of the ejecta where a uniform density core is surrounded by a power law envelope .",
    "the evolution while the reverse shock is in the outer envelope is given by @xcite ; this solution is then coupled to the known asymptotic behavior of the sedov - taylor solution . in this phase",
    ", we have previously held the reverse shock speed constant at its value at the envelope - core transition , although it is known that some small acceleration should occur during the core propagation .",

    "extrapolation to other cases is simple , since element masses are proportional to @xmath86 .",
    "table 2 also gives plane of the sky velocities for each element ( calculated from the position of the center of mass of each element , and assuming homologous expansion ) , and for the snr as a whole , and compares abundance ratios relative to o with solar system values .",
    "we also comment here that cas a is thought to have retained some h at the time of explosion @xcite , and this may contribute to the thermal bremsstrahlung emission here attributed to o. in this case , our ejecta mass estimate would be an underestimate , and if the h ( and presumably also he ) were not uniformly distributed , the recoil velocity we attribute to the o ejecta could be in error .",
    "it is difficult to assess an uncertainty here , but we note that the amount of light elements involved is likely rather small and unlikely to alter our conclusion of an approximately 3 @xmath62 ejecta mass .    in table 3",

    "our analysis of more than 4300 ejecta regions gives a mass of x - ray emitting fe in the cas a ejecta of @xmath91 , depending on the assumed filling factor and threshold value of reduced @xmath9 for acceptance of the `` pure '' fe component .",

    "if , for example the filling factor for fe should be smaller , this would yield a smaller fe mass .",

    "a mass this high is unlikely for cas a , however , given that its highly stripped progenitor underwent a type iib event .",
    "dust will form relatively more efficiently in a normal type ii event because the overlying stellar envelope restricts ejecta expansion and preserves higher densities favorable for dust condensation .",
    "while fe appears to be scarce both in the shocked ejecta and the unshocked infrared emitting ejecta at the center of the snr , fe may yet be present in the unshocked ejecta given that the intrinsic emissivities of the infra - red lines of fe ii are rather weak compared to , say , si ii .",
    "another complication is that there may be a population of low - density fe ejecta , whose composition and distribution are currently unconstrained .",
    "sufficiently large clumps of fe might be expected to reside in low density regions due to inflation by radioactivity .",
    "eriksen ( 2009 ) note that the lack of detectable fe lines in the _ spitzer _ data indicate that any fe material still interior to the reverse shock must indeed be at a low density , though they also suggest that the absence of fe is more likely to be an abundance effect .",
    "while an accurate assessment of infra - red limits must be deferred to another work , strong outward mixing of fe into at least the he layer has been inferred for the type iib prototype sn 1993j based on modelling its light curve @xcite .",
    "cas a resembles sn 1993j , not only in its explosion spectrum ( seen as a light echo , krause et al .",
    "2004 ) , but in having a similar and low pre - explosion main sequence mass , and a binary companion implicated by its strong pre - supernova mass loss .",
    "if our tentative conclusions about the paucity of fe in the unshocked ejecta survive more detailed scrutiny , then almost all of the fe ejected by the supernova is now well outside the reverse shock and visible in x - rays , with very little left in the center of the remnant .",
    "this would be true even for the `` pure '' fe component , which could be the ashes of @xmath2-rich freezeout .",
    "the inference that the cas a neutron star has a carbon atmosphere @xcite would seem to support the notion that the interior ejecta composition is dominated by elements lighter than fe .",
    "along these lines , recent work by @xcite raises the interesting possibility that under the right conditions , a quark nova of the incipient neutron star could produce @xmath98ti by spallation at the expense of @xmath99ni , and also cause c formation consistent with the inferred composition of the compact object in cas a.    closely related to explosive fe nucleosynthesis is the production of @xmath98ti .",

    "this is well outside the ejecta region where the fe was formed , and into the outer layers where the composition would originally have been dominated by o , si , c , and ne .",

    "if the fe is associated with the @xmath98ti , it must be expanding in a direction close to the plane of the sky .",

    "with respect to the distribution of @xmath98ti , sn 1987a presents a stark contrast to cas a , with ejecta containing @xmath98ti located at the center with a characteristic expansion speed of @xmath111 km s@xmath43 @xcite .",
    "g1.9 + 0.3 may represent an intermediate case @xcite .",
    "finally , cas a has a well documented displacement of the neutron star formed in the explosion @xcite , which is close to perpendicular to the ne - sw `` jet''-axis . while contrary to expectations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the fe in cas a does not recoil in the opposite direction to the neutron star , as far as we can tell , but the remnant as a whole does .",
    "we take this as reinforcing the notion that neutron star kicks in core - collapse supernova explosions may derive from purely hydrodynamic mechanisms , as recently suggested ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . together with motion and location of the fe ejecta , and the likelihood that what is observed as a ne - sw `` jet '' really is an artefact of an asymmetric explosion , we speculate that an instability of the standing accretion shock ( sasi ) in a rotating progenitor is the most promising model for understanding the explosion that formed cas a.    we thank roger chevalier , elisabetta micelotta , rob petre , and the referee for helpful comments on the paper .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge support through nasa grants to the chandra guest observer program and nnh04zss001n to the long term space astrophysics program .",
    "jml was also supported by basic research funds of the office of naval research .",
    "we collect here a few minor corrections and modifications to the text in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "equations a1 and a2 should read @xmath112 @xmath113    the expressions for the lead factor and the pressure ratio between forward and reverse shocks following equation a5 are now more accurately given by @xmath114 @xmath115    finally , as pointed out to us by elisabetta micelotta , some of the discussion following equation a8 in @xcite requires clarification .",
    "equation a5 can be derived from the envelope form of equation a8 , i.e. from equations a7 and a8 in @xcite .",
    "this procedure requires @xmath116 going from equation 74 to 75 in @xcite . in their equation 31 , @xcite give @xmath117 , which implies @xmath118 .",
    "however their derivation of equation 31 assumes @xmath119 in their derivation .",
    "a `` cleaner '' route to equation 75 of @xcite is to take their values of @xmath120 and the ejecta mass fraction in the core derived under the condition @xmath119 , and substitute into equation 3 of @xcite .",
    "the condition @xmath121 still gives the time @xmath39 when the reverse shock hits the ejecta core .",
    "the only other change connected with this discussion is that equation a11 for @xmath122 in @xcite should depend on @xmath120 and not @xmath123 .",
    "in actual fact , the difference between the approximations @xmath124 and @xmath125 is not all that large ; @xmath126 in these limits , which coincide for @xmath127 .",
    "the core fraction of the ejecta mass varies between @xmath128 and 1 , and only @xmath123 which goes from @xmath129 to @xmath120 between these two limits is sensitive .",
    "a correction is needed for unresolved density structure in the ejecta .",
    "models of supernova remnants expanding into a stellar wind ( @xmath130 ) density profile generally show a strong density `` spike '' in the radial direction at the contact discontinuity , and if the reverse shock is still propagating through the outer power law portion of the ejecta density profile , the density at the contact discontinuity is formally infinite @xcite .",
    "later in its evolution , the density spike is still present @xcite , with a width corresponding to about 2 arcsec .",
    "this is comparable to or smaller than the size of many of our fit regions , so we expect that ejecta structures will not always be resolved , and a filling factor correction is therefore needed when calculating the plasma electron density ( see subsection 4.1 ) .",
    "we take the volume of each spectral region o be @xmath131 where @xmath77 is the area imaged in arcsec@xmath64 .",
    "this is modified to @xmath132 , where @xmath79 is the `` filling factor '' of the ejecta density profile .",
    "we estimate a quantitative filling factor @xmath79 to be applied to our fit results in terms of the density scale length @xmath133 as @xmath134 in deriving @xmath133 , we follow @xcite , who give a similarity solution for ejecta structure close to the contact discontinuity . treating the expansion of uniform density ejecta , they use a coordinate system with @xmath135 at @xmath136 , the outer limit of the ejecta at time @xmath137 if they were freely expanding without interacting with the reverse shock .",
    "the location of the reverse shock is @xmath138 , giving dimensionless eulerian and lagrangian coordinates @xmath139 and @xmath140 respectively , where @xmath141 is the initial value of @xmath142 in a lagrangian plasma element at the time that the plasma was shocked , i.e. @xmath138 at the time of shock passage . with these definitions , close to the contact discontinuity they find ( their equation 13 ) @xmath143 where @xmath144 for a stellar wind external density profile , @xmath145 is the value of @xmath146 at the contact discontinuity , and @xmath147 is the dimensionless reverse shock velocity .",
    "the pressure is @xmath148 , and @xmath149 is the pressure at the reverse shock .",
    "neglecting the dependence of @xmath148 on @xmath150 in this region , we write @xmath151 so that the density scale length @xmath152 .",
    "we calculate the average of this quantity @xmath153 using @xmath154 the integrals are evaluated using the substitution @xmath155 , with the final result @xmath156    including the variation of @xmath148 , @xmath133 in equation b5 is modified to @xmath157 from table 1 of @xcite , @xmath158 varies from -1 at the reverse shock to about -0.6 at the contact discontinuity , which reduces the value for @xmath133 derived assuming @xmath159 by 5% to 7% . for completeness , if the external density @xmath160 , then @xmath161 and @xmath162 , independent of @xmath163 .",
    "the filling factor is then calculated as @xmath164 , with @xmath133 and @xmath77 here expressed in arcsec and arcsec@xmath64 respectively .",
    "as we discuss in the paper , our data suggest that many secondary shocks reflect from the blast wave and reverse shock as they encounter density inhomogeneities in cas a. we therefore use equation b4 with the tacit assumption of constant pressure near the contact discontinuity . @xcite point out that this approximation is also made by @xcite in their energy equation .",
    "with @xmath165 we find @xmath166 cm , which at a distance of 3.4 kpc subtends an angle of 2.48 arcsec . in this last step",
    "we are extrapolating slightly out of the formal range of validity of the @xcite model .",
    "there , @xmath167 , which requires an expansion velocity of the outermost ejecta greater than 20,000 km s@xmath43 for values of @xmath168 pc and @xmath169 pc appropriate for cas a. it is also worth bearing in mind other caveats to the application of this model .",
    "@xcite assume uniform density ejecta , while we adopt the prescription of @xcite of a core - envelope density profile .",
    "we have also introduced the circumstellar `` bubble '' into which cas a is assumed to have exploded .",

    "<S> we present a survey of the x - ray emitting ejecta in the cassiopeia a supernova remnant based on an extensive analysis of over 6000 spectral regions extracted on 2.5 - 10@xmath0 angular scales using the chandra 1 ms observation . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret these results in the context of hydrodynamical models for the evolution of the remnant . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of fitted temperature and ionization age , and the implied mass coordinates , are highly peaked and suggest that the ejecta were subjected to multiple secondary shocks following reverse shock interaction with ejecta inhomogeneities . based on the fitted emission measure and element abundances , and an estimate of the emitting volume , we derive masses for the x - ray emitting ejecta and also show the distribution of the mass of various elements over the remnant . </S>",
    "<S> an upper limit to the total shocked fe mass visible in x - rays appears to be roughly 0.13 m@xmath1 , which accounts for nearly all of the mass expected in fe ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> we find two populations of fe ejecta , that associated with normal si - burning and that possibly associated with @xmath2-rich freeze - out , with a mass ratio of approximately 2:1 . </S>",
    "<S> essentially all of the observed fe ( both components ) lies well outside the central regions of the snr , possibly having been ejected by hydrodynamic instabilities during the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss this , and its implications for the neutron star kick . </S>"
