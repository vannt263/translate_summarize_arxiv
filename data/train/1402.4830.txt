    "<S> we investigate the interplay of disorder and interactions in the accelerated transport of a bose - einstein condensate through an incommensurate optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we show that interactions can effectively cancel the damping of bloch oscillations due to the disordered potential and we provide a simple model to qualitatively capture this screening effect . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the characteristic interaction energy , above which interactions and disorder cooperate to enhance , rather than reduce , the damping of bloch oscillations , coincides with the average disorder depth . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with results of a mean - field simulation .    </S>",
    "<S> = 1    the combined effects of disorder and interactions in condensed - matter systems can influence their transport properties in profound ways . beyond merely reducing conductivity , </S>",
    "<S> disorder can lead to anderson localization @xcite in the absence of interactions , and repulsive interactions can , in turn , give rise to localized mott phases @xcite without the influence of disorder . while disorder and interaction act cooperatively in the limit of strong interactions by promoting disordered insulating phases @xcite , weak interactions in bosonic systems can counteract the localizing effects of disorder by making accessible higher - energy states , thus screening the disorder potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the often subtle interplay between disorder and interactions is relevant for condensed - matter systems such as superfluid helium in porous media and disordered films @xcite and granular superconductors @xcite , but it can also be studied experimentally with ultracold atoms in optical lattices . while optical lattices are naturally defect free @xcite , it is possible to implement disorder using laser speckle @xcite , localized impurity atoms @xcite , and incommensurate standing waves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments with disordered optical potentials have addressed anderson localization @xcite , delocalization due to repulsive interactions @xcite , as well as the formation of glassy , localized phases in the regime of strong repulsive interactions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> disorder and interactions also fundamentally affect the dynamics of particles in lattice potentials . </S>",
    "<S> static external forcing results in coherent bloch oscillations ( bos ) @xcite that prevent macroscopic transport unless there exist mechanisms for relaxation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while bos are overdamped in conventional solids , they can be observed in superlattice semiconductors @xcite and also with ultracold atoms in optical lattices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when using atomic quantum gases , minimizing the collisional interactions allows for the direct observation of extremely long - lived bos @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> typical mean - field interactions in bose - einstein condensates already result in significant dephasing @xcite due to nonlinearities , dynamical instability , and quantum chaotic dynamics @xcite ( it has recently been observed that in certain parameter regimes , such dephasing can be reversible @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> . a qualitatively similar dephasing of bos in optical lattices was also observed to occur due to the additional presence of disorder , which scrambles the regular phase evolution between lattice sites @xcite .    for the case that both interactions and disorder are present </S>",
    "<S> , it has been predicted that the combined effects can modify the bloch oscillation dynamics , either reducing or enhancing the damping due to disorder , depending on their relative magnitude @xcite . in the present manuscript </S>",
    "<S> , we study the interplay between disorder and interactions in the dynamics of bloch oscillations in an incommensurate lattice . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that for a given disorder - induced damping rate , increased interactions can reduce or enhance the overall damping rate . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we identify a characteristic interaction strength between the regimes of reduction and enhancement , corresponding to a typical disorder energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a simple model to capture the basic features of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> in our experiment we load a bec of a few @xmath0 @xmath1rb atoms in the @xmath2 hyperfine state into a crossed optical dipole trap ( xodt ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a magnetic field gradient levitates the bec in the trap , before a one - dimensional optical lattice @xmath3 is adiabatically ramped up along the vertical direction @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are the lattice depths in units of the main lattice recoil energy @xmath8 , @xmath9 is planck s reduced constant and @xmath10 nm and @xmath11 nm are the wavelengths of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath12 is used as a measure of the lattice commensurability ; for nearly irrational @xmath13 , the lattices will be periodic on length scales exceeding those relevant to the experiment . for all measurements , </S>",
    "<S> the main lattice has a depth of @xmath14 and the second lattice depth is varied from @xmath15 to @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we define the disorder strength @xmath17 as the average energy shift of a lattice site due to the secondary lattice , @xmath18 , which also corresponds to the energy scale @xmath19 of perturbations to the band structure .    ) for @xmath15 and 0.46 respectively . </S>",

    "<S> the lines are linear fits to guide the eye . in ( b - d ) , each data point represents three repetitions of the experiment , error bars represent standard deviations . </S>",
    "<S> , height=240 ]    the chemical potential of the condensate is adjusted in a range @xmath26 prior to loading the lattice by varying the atom number as well as the trapping frequency of the xodt from @xmath27 hz to @xmath28 hz . to induce bos </S>",
    "<S> the levitating gradient is rapidly switched off in @xmath29 @xmath30s , and the atoms are allowed to evolve in the lattice plus xodt potentials for a variable hold time . during this time the atoms undergo bos with period @xmath31 ms where @xmath32 is the gravitational force , and @xmath33 is the main lattice spacing ; for our system @xmath34 @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms are then suddenly released and the atomic momentum distribution is imaged on a ccd camera after 18  ms time of flight , as shown in figure  [ fig : bos ] ( a ) .    after repeating the experiment for different hold times , </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations are recorded as seen in figure  [ fig : bos ] ( b , c ) . </S>",
    "<S> a damping rate @xmath20 is extracted from the data by fitting the mean of the linear momentum with @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the energy dispersion of the first band of the lattice as a function of quasimomuntum @xmath38 which evolves as @xmath39 . the gaussian envelope is chosen because at short times the @xmath40 behaviour best matches dephasing due to two beating frequencies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this also matches previously observed and simulated bo damping behaviour due to both interactions and incommensurate lattices @xcite , while a pure exponential envelope has been suggested in the disorder - free case @xcite .    in the weakly interacting ( @xmath24 ) and disorder - free case ( figure  [ fig : bos ] ( b ) ) we observe several 10 @xmath41 of only weakly damped oscillations , with damping due to the nonzero interaction energy and the harmonic confinement of the xodt . </S>",
    "<S> when adding the second lattice with @xmath42 the damping time is markedly reduced to just a few @xmath41 , as seen in figure  [ fig : bos ] ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> as illustrated in figure  [ fig : bos ] ( d ) , increasing the secondary lattice depth increases the damping rate for a weakly interacting cloud ; however , as shown for two interactions @xmath24 and 0.42 , the effect of the disorder is weaker when stronger interactions are present . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the effect of interactions depends on the depth of the disorder potential : for small @xmath43 , the damping rate is higher for low @xmath44 while the opposite is true for @xmath45 .     and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> our irrational @xmath47 is approximated by @xmath48 , which is still nonperiodic on experimental length scales . </S>",
    "<S> the bold red curve outlines the perturbed lowest band of the @xmath15 lattice while the grey lines represent minibands of the bichromatic potential . </S>",
    "<S> the primary effect of the second lattice is to open minigaps in the lowest band . </S>",

    "<S> , height=240 ]    to elucidate this further , we investigate the damping in the noninteracting and interacting regimes separately . in the noninteracting case , it can be described by considering the single particle band structure of the lattice potential . </S>",
    "<S> starting with all the atoms at @xmath50 in the lowest band , for @xmath15 the atoms experience a continuous , periodic dispersion relation @xmath37 giving rise to long - lived bloch oscillations described by ( [ fitfnt ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the chief effect of the second lattice , seen in figure  [ fig : lz ] ( a ) , is to open minigaps of energy @xmath51 in the band structure at @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the minigaps serve to disrupt the evolution of the momentum distribution by splitting the condensate among the minibands of the lattice through landau - zener tunnelling @xcite , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : lz ] ( b ) . because the minigaps appear at irrational fractions of the original brillouin zone width 2@xmath54 </S>",
    "<S> , the rephasing time for the split condensate is much longer than the oscillation lifetime in our experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of atoms which tunnel to those that pass the minigap adiabatically is approximately @xmath55}. \\label{lzeq}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the unperturbed band s slope at the gap . in absorption images of the momentum distribution , the splitting </S>",
    "<S> is clearly seen after passing through just one half of the brillouin zone , figure  [ fig : lz ] ( c ) . </S>",
    "<S> unlike in figure  [ fig : bos ] ( a ) , where a single colour lattice gives peaks separated by @xmath57 , we observe an extra peak at a momentum separation of @xmath49 . for longer evolution times as in figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lz ] ( d ) , the condensate breaks up into a series of peaks with spacing @xmath49 , spanning a range of momenta between @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a breakdown of collective oscillation and accelerated damping .    </S>",
    "<S> mean - field interactions in the bec modify the damping by changing the miniband shape near the minigap , causing the minibands to develop a swallow - tail structure , corresponding to a discontinuous , multivalued energy spectrum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuity leads to the breakdown of adiabaticity in the strong - interaction limit @xmath59 , resulting in an expected increase in the fraction @xmath60 of atoms that tunnel through the gap and remain on the perturbed original band . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the nonlinearities can also be considered as an effective rescaling of the gap size in ( [ lzeq ] ) according to the interaction energy . </S>",
    "<S> the effective @xmath61 is as much as 50% smaller for @xmath62 .    to estimate the damping of bos due to these mechanisms </S>",
    "<S> , we numerically propagate a wavepacket through the bichromatic dispersion relation . for simplicity , the calculation does not keep track of the accrued phases . additionally , at times when a wavepacket reaches a minigap , it is instantaneously split according to a nonlinear landau - zener calculation in which interactions have the effect of increasing the tunnelling rate without explicitly including the swallow - tail structure in @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the results , shown for @xmath63 in figure  [ fig : lz ] ( e ) , predict a decrease in the damping rate as the interactions are ramped up . we note that this simple calculation does not separately address the damping induced by interactions themselves , which perturb the evenly spaced wannier - stark energy levels of the tilted(forced)-lattice , giving rise to irreversible damping for our lattice parameters in which the energy offset between lattice sites is comparable to the tunnelling matrix element @xcite .    the predicted decrease of the landau - zener induced damping due to interactions as in figure  [ fig : lz ] ( e ) agrees with our experimental data to within a factor of 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy could be due to a number of factors . </S>",
    "<S> for example , our calculation does not take into account the three dimensional nature of the experimental setup nor does it include possible coherence effects for the landau - zener tunnelling , which are difficult to incorporate in the quasiperiodic potential . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption that the tunnelling through a minigap happens all at once could also alter the calculated dynamics as the condensate has a finite momentum width and passes through many minigaps in rapid succession .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally we have selected our parameters to best probe the relationship between interaction - induced damping and landau - zener damping due to the potential s quasi - disorder . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : dip ] ( a ) plots the measured damping rate with varied chemical potential for different disorder depths , as described in figure  [ fig : bos ] ( b , c ) . in the @xmath15 case </S>",
    "<S> we observe , as expected from earlier related work @xcite , a steady increase in the interaction - induced damping . for @xmath64 , </S>",
    "<S> the initial damping in the weakly interacting case is significantly enhanced . however , for increasing interactions , within an experimentally accessible range , we subsequently observe a _ decrease _ in the damping rate , only to be followed later by a small increase . </S>",
    "<S> a heuristic parabolic fit yields a chemical potential @xmath65 for minimum damping .     for different @xmath7 . for the @xmath15 case ( red , solid , triangles ) , the damping rate increases roughly linearly with @xmath44 . for a larger disorder @xmath66 ( blue , dashed , circles ) </S>",
    "<S> a clear decrease in the damping rate is observed as the @xmath44 is increased . </S>",
    "<S> lines are fits to guide the eye . from a parabolic fit to the @xmath66 data a minimum at @xmath67 is obtained . in b ) we plot the same data obtained from a 3dgpe simulation . </S>",
    "<S> a fit finds a minimum damping rate at @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> , height=240 ]    the observed behaviour is consistent with a simple qualitative picture in which the interactions initially screen out the disorder , thus allowing for longer lived oscillations . above @xmath69 </S>",
    "<S> the damping driven by interactions outweighs the screening and the damping rate begins to increase . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath70 , indicating that the crossover from disorder dominated to mean - field dominated behaviour occurs when the interacton strength becomes comparable to the disorder . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with findings for the equilibrium case @xcite , where a weakly interacting condensate with @xmath71 tends to become fragmented , corresponding to a breakdown of global coherence across the cloud , and where the fragmentation becomes less severe leading to increased phase coherence as the potential is `` filled '' by the interaction energy . above @xmath69 , the amount of fragmentation </S>",
    "<S> is limited with only weak dependence @xmath44 and mean - field effects take over as the disorder is of minimal significance to the cloud s coherence .    to confirm our experimental finding that @xmath72 </S>",
    "<S> , we perform a three dimensional gross - pitaevskii equation ( 3dgpe ) simulation with experimental parameters as inputs ( see figure  [ fig : dip ] ( b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> data from the simulation is analysed in a manner identical to the experimental data and a very similar behaviour of the damping rate is observed , with a minimum at @xmath73 in good agreement with our experimental findings . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the factor of @xmath74 absolute discrepancy between the experimental and simulated rates could result from the fact that our full 3dgpe does not account for depletion of the condensate .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that interactions and disorder can compete to determine the transport properties of a lattice trapped superfluid . the competition results in the decrease of the disorder - induced damping rate of bos . </S>",
    "<S> our findings for bloch oscillations are also consistent with other recent transport measurements in disordered potentials , including dipole oscillations in a quasiperiodic potential @xcite and in a 2d speckle potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed effect saturates at a minimum damping rate when the interaction energy becomes comparable to the characteristic energy scale of the disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> the interaction - induced delocalization effects observed here are also relevant for the description of systems ranging from superfluid helium in porous materials to superconductivity in granular or disordered materials @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> the competition between disorder and ineractions ultimately contrasts with cooperative behaviour in the regime of stronger interactions , which can give rise to strongly localized , disordered phases such as the bose glass @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our findings in the crossover between the two regimes give an example of how subtle the parameter dependence can be in a given system .    </S>",
