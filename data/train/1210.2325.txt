    "these claims follow tsuboi @xcite .",
    "let us first show why claims ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are enough to establish the theorem .",
    "let @xmath99 the map @xmath100 is @xmath79 at @xmath101 and @xmath102 looks like @xmath103 to all orders at @xmath104 similarly , @xmath105 is @xmath79 at @xmath106 and @xmath107 looks like @xmath108 to all orders at @xmath109 therefore , when we glue @xmath110 and @xmath111 the result is @xmath112 the fact that @xmath22 follows , since we declared @xmath113 to be a diffeomorphism .",

    "we must show that @xmath92 is @xmath79 .",
    "the only difficulty is that @xmath114 is not differentiable when @xmath115 ( it stretches too strongly there ) .",
    "the first component of @xmath92  the one in @xmath116 , which we may denote @xmath117  is not affected by @xmath114 , so it is automatically @xmath79 .",
    "consider the second component , @xmath118 .",

    "we may replace @xmath32 with @xmath173 in the statement of the theorem .",
    "most of the proof is unchanged .",
    "we must do slightly more for claim ( 1 ) , that is , showing that conjugation of a @xmath12 map by @xmath88 is still @xmath12 .",
    "this is because the map `` @xmath122 '' may be only @xmath174 but it can be seen by an inductive argument that @xmath175 is @xmath176",
    "in this section , we use our main result to construct new examples of smooth actions of the discrete heisenberg group @xmath177 on surfaces .",

    "@xmath177 obviously acts linearly on @xmath189 we may `` projectivize '' this to get an action on @xmath190 which is faithful and real - analytic .",

    "if we also puncture at the other fixed point , we get an action of @xmath177 on the open annulus . in fact , there is a canonical way of compactifying to get a closed disk @xmath196 or closed annulus @xmath197 called `` blowing up , '' which we will describe . by doing a blow up at one or both fixed points , we get an action of @xmath177 on the closed disk and on the closed annulus .    _",
    "blowing up .",
    "_ for reference , see melrose @xcite .",
    "let us first consider blowing up the origin in @xmath198 intuitively , we will remove the origin , and insert an @xmath40-sphere there . define the blow up to be @xmath199 together with the blow - down map @xmath200 given by @xmath201 ( @xmath26 is identified with the unit sphere in @xmath202 ) .",

    "the green points in the action of @xmath183 have the following significance .",
    "let @xmath228 ( for equator ) be the horizontal line through the center of the disk , and @xmath229 the boundary ; @xmath230 has two components , which we may denote @xmath231 and @xmath232 ( upper and lower ) .",

    "the action of @xmath177 on the closed annulus is similar ; we take the action on the closed disk , and blow up at the global fixed point at the center .    since the given actions of @xmath177 on @xmath196 and @xmath238 agree on the boundary components , we may glue them together , or glue the two boundary components of the annulus .",

    "suppose we define an action on @xmath7 to be `` decomposable '' if @xmath7 decomposes into topological ( not necessarily smooth ) manifolds with boundary @xmath246 which meet only on their boundaries , such that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are invariant . then all the given @xmath177 actions are decomposable .",
    "even the original actions on @xmath196 and @xmath238 decompose into invariant upper and lower halves , since the original action of @xmath177 on @xmath190 leaves the northern and southern hemispheres invariant .",
    "do there exist any faithful @xmath79 ( or even @xmath247 ) actions of @xmath177 on @xmath190 which are not , in this sense , decomposable ?",
    "danny calegari @xcite has given an example of a faithful @xmath248 action of @xmath177 on the sphere which is indecomposable .",
    "it is gotten as follows .",
    "first , note that in the linear action of @xmath177 on @xmath249 the plane @xmath250 is invariant .",
    "this yields an affine action of @xmath177 on the plane , generated by @xmath251 @xmath252 with commutator @xmath253    let @xmath254 be irrational , and let @xmath255 denote horizontal translation by @xmath256 we may take the quotient of the plane by @xmath255 ; the result is a cylinder . the action of @xmath177 on the plane descends to this cylinder , since both @xmath209 and @xmath91 commute with @xmath257 this action is smooth .",
    "we may next compactify the two ends of the cylinder with points , so we get a sphere .",
    "the resulting action of @xmath177 on @xmath190 is only @xmath258 and it can not be conjugated to a @xmath247 example .    in this example ,",
    "@xmath209 acts by twisting by an amount dependent on how high up we are . as we move up towards the north pole , or down to the south pole , it twists infinitely many times .",
    "@xmath91 acts by moving every point except the poles upward .",
    "@xmath122 is an irrational rotation of the sphere .",
    "it is easily seen that this example is indecomposable in the sense we have given .",
    "however , it does not satisfy the stronger condition of topological transitivity , namely , that there exist a point @xmath192 whose orbit under @xmath177 is dense .",
    "does there exist a faithful @xmath248 action of @xmath177 on @xmath190 which is topologically transitive ?",
    "there does exist a faithful @xmath79 action of @xmath177 on the torus @xmath259 which is topologically transitive , indeed , which is minimal .",
    "consider the action of @xmath177 on the plane given above .",
    "let @xmath254 be irrational .",
    "let @xmath255 and @xmath260 be irrational horizontal and vertical translations ; if we take the quotient @xmath261 we get a torus .",
    "we claim that the action of @xmath177 on the plane descends to this torus .",
    "since @xmath91 is a translation , it commutes with @xmath255 and @xmath262 the skew map @xmath209 commutes with @xmath257 it fails to commute with @xmath263 but the commutator is @xmath264 = t_{(\\alpha , 0)},$ ] which is trivial on the torus .    if we denote the induced maps on the torus with bars , then @xmath265 and @xmath266 are vertical and horizontal irrational translations of the torus .",
    "thus the orbit of any point is dense under this action of @xmath267",
    "a useful notion from geometric group theory is that of _ distortion_.            it is straightforward to see that the property of being a distortion element is independent of the finite generating set chosen .",
    "if @xmath4 is not finitely generated , we say that @xmath269 is distorted in @xmath4 if it is distorted in some finitely generated subgroup of @xmath4 .",
    "see gromov @xcite for a good discussion with many examples .",
    "one reason why distortion elements are interesting is that well - known groups have them .",
    "it is easy to check that the central elements of the three - dimensional heisenberg group are distortion elements .",
    "lubotzky , mozes , and raghunathan proved that irreducible nonuniform lattices in higher - rank lie groups have distortion elements ( @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath273 be a closed surface .",
    "let @xmath274 denote @xmath247 diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity .",
    "let @xmath275 be distorted .",
    "if @xmath276 assume @xmath209 has at least 3 fixed points ; if @xmath277 assume @xmath209 has at least 1 fixed point",

    "the result can be called the _ double _ of @xmath287    by remark 2 following the theorem , we can choose conjugacies @xmath68 and @xmath69 to make the glued map @xmath288 be @xmath289 in fact , since @xmath0 and @xmath1 are both copies of @xmath290 we can find a single conjugacy @xmath291 and let @xmath292    any fixed point for @xmath209 in the interior @xmath293 yields two fixed points for @xmath222 one on each side . a fixed point for @xmath209 on @xmath294 yields one fixed point for @xmath295 the hypotheses given in the corollary guarantee that @xmath211 has as many fixed points as the theorem of franks and handel requires : one for @xmath259 and three for @xmath296    there will be an invariant probability measure not supported on the fixed point set of @xmath295 namely , @xmath297 preserves the measure @xmath298 whose support is @xmath299 on the other hand , @xmath300 so @xmath301 if we take @xmath302 on both copies of @xmath290 we get an invariant measure for @xmath211 not supported in @xmath303      we can slightly weaken the assumptions : if @xmath306 and a distortion element @xmath209 has at least 2 fixed points anywhere , or has a fixed point on the boundary , then ( * ) holds .",
