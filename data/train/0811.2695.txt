    "recent years have witnessed advances in the heavy baryon spectroscopy , with the discoveries of the heavy baryons involving the @xmath4 and @xmath2 quarks . since the spin of the baryon carries information on the spin of the heavy quark , the study of the heavy baryons might also lead us to study the spin effects at the loop level in the standard model .    to study the meson - baryon couplings , a non - perturbative method is needed . among all non - perturbative approaches , the qcd sum rules approach",
    "@xcite-@xcite has received special attention to study the properties of hadrons . in the case of the light baryons ,",
    "this method has been successfully applied for calculation of the meson - baryon coupling constants .",
    "the pion - nucleon coupling constant has been studied in traditional three - point qcd sum rules @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the kaon - baryon coupling constants have also been calculated in the same framework in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the latter has also been studied in light cone qcd sum rules ( lcqsr ) in @xcite .",
    "the coupling constant for k meson - octet baryons and @xmath5 meson - octet baryons have also been calculated in @xcite in lcqsr .",
    "the qcd sum rules is also applied to the study of the heavy hadron mass spectrum ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the masses are also studied in qcd string model @xcite and using quark model in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "sum rules between the masses of the heavy baryons derived using the quark model has been analyzed and experimental tests of sum rules for heavy baryon masses have been discussed in @xcite . in the present work , using the general form of the current for @xmath6 and @xmath7 baryons , we calculate the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) coupling constants in the framework of the lcqsr approach .",
    "having computed the coupling constants , we also evaluate the total decay widths for strong @xmath3 decays and compare our results with the predictions of the relativistic three - quark model ( rtqm ) @xcite , light - front quark model ( lfqm ) @xcite and existing experimental data .",
    "the paper encompasses three sections : in the next section , we calculate the lcqsr for the coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "section iii is devoted to the numerical analysis of the coupling constant @xmath0 , our prediction for the total decay rates and discussion .",
    "to calculate the coupling constant @xmath0 in lcqsr , one starts with a suitably chosen correlation function . in this work ,",

    ", the hadrons are represented by their interpolating quark currents .",
    "this correlation function can be calculated in two different ways : on the one hand , inserting complete sets of hadronic states into the correlation function , it can be expressed in terms of hadronic parameters such as the masses , residues and the coupling constants . on the other hand , it can be calculated in terms of quark - gluon parameters in the deep euclidean region when @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the coupling constant is determined by matching these two different representations of the correlation function and applying double borel transformation with respect to the momentum of both hadrons to suppress the contributions of the higher states and continuum .",
    "the derivation of the physical ( or phenomenological ) representation of the correlation function follows the same lines as in the case of light hadrons ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for completeness , we repeat the derivation below .",
