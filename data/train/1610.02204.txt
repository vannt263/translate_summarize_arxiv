    "<S> transmission electron microscopy has been a promising candidate for mapping atomic orbitals for a long time . here , we explore its capabilities by a first principles approach . </S>",
    "<S> for the example of defected graphene , exhibiting either an isolated vacancy or a substitutional nitrogen atom , we show that three different kinds of images are to be expected , depending on the orbital character . to judge the feasibility of visualizing orbitals in a real microscope , the effect of the optics aberrations is simulated . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that , by making use of energy - filtering , it should indeed be possible to map atomic orbitals in a state - of - the - art transmission electron microscope .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility to _ see _ atomic orbitals has always attracted great scientific interest . at the same time , however , the real meaning of `` measuring orbitals '' has been a subject that scientists have long and much dwelt upon ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in the past , significant efforts have been devoted to the development of experimental approaches and theoretical models that allow for orbital reconstruction from experimental data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on the generation of higher harmonics by femtoseconds laser pulses , a tomographic reconstruction of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) for simple diatomic molecules in the gas phase was proposed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> direct imaging of the homo and the lowest - occupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of pentacene on a metallic substrate was theoretically predicted and experimentally verified with scanning - tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , real - space reconstruction of molecular orbitals from angle - resolved photoemission data has been demonstrated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this method has been subsequently further developed to retrieve both the spatial distribution @xcite and the phase of electron wavefunctions of pentacene and perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride ( ptcda ) adsorbed on silver @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the reconstruction of charge densities and chemical bonds using transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) has been considered @xcite , but only recently the possibility of probing selected transitions to specific unoccupied orbitals by using energy - filtered tem ( eftem ) was demonstrated theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> a first example for the capability of this approach was provided with the oxygen k - edge of rutile tio@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however the interpretation of experimental tem images for systems like rutile would be complicated because of the multiple elastic scattering of electrons that occurs in thick samples .    in this letter , we suggest defective graphene @xcite as the prototypical two dimensional ( 2d ) material to demonstrate the possibility of mapping atomic orbitals using eftem . </S>",
    "<S> we break the ideal @xmath1 hybridization by introducing two different kinds of defects , namely a single isolated vacancy and a substitutional nitrogen atom . </S>",
    "<S> this lifts the degeneracy of the @xmath2-states , inducing strong modifications to the electronic properties compared to the pristine lattice @xcite . by selecting certain scattering angles , </S>",
    "<S> dipole - allowed transitions dominate the electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) signal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a single - particle description can be safely adopted , since many - body effects do not play a major role in the excitation process . </S>",
    "<S> overall , tem images of these systems can be interpreted in terms of bare @xmath3 transitions .    in an eftem experiment , </S>",
    "<S> an incoming beam of high - energy electrons ( of the order of 100 kev ) is directed to the target where it scatters at the atoms either elastically or inelastically . </S>",
    "<S> the outgoing electron beam is detected and analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> state of the art image simulations generally only include elastic scattering of the electrons using the multi - slice approach @xcite . in the case of eftem for a thin sample , </S>",
    "<S> the influence of elastic scattering becomes negligible , and inelastic scattering gives the dominant contribution to the formation of the images .    the key quantity to describe the inelastic scattering of electrons , which is probed by eels , is the mixed dynamic form factor ( mdff ) . </S>",
    "<S> it can be interpreted as a weighted sum of transition matrix elements between initial and final states @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the target electron @xcite :    @xmath6    with energies @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 is the energy - loss of the fast electron of the incident beam , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the wavevectors of the perturbing and induced density fluctuations , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> if many - body effects can be neglected , this picture can be simplified for dipole - allowed transitions . in this case , using the spherical harmonics as basis for the target states and referring to transitions originating from a single state ( as in @xmath3 excitations ) , the mdff is @xcite    @xmath12    where @xmath13 are spherical harmonics , @xmath14 is an integral of the spherical bessel function @xmath15 weighted over the initial and final radial wavefunctions . @xmath16 and @xmath17 indicate the azimuthal and magnetic quantum number of the final state of the target electron , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the angular momenta transferred during the transition . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 is a quantity that describes crystal - field effects and is proportional to the cross - density of states ( xdos ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the angular part of the final wave function , @xmath23 is the band index , and @xmath24 is a k - point in the first brillouin zone . compared to the density of states ( dos ) , the xdos includes also non - diagonal terms connecting states with different angular momenta . as @xmath25 is a hermitian matrix @xcite , the mdff can be diagonalized . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , assuming that the target s final states of the @xmath3 excitation are not degenerate , the transition matrix elements reflect the azimuthal shape of the final single - particle states and can thus be separated by using energy - filtering .    </S>",
    "<S> ground - state calculations are performed using density - functional theory and the full - potential augmented planewave plus local - orbital method , as implemented in exciting @xcite . introducing a vacancy or a substitutional atom , a 5@xmath265 supercell </S>",
    "<S> is set up , hosting 49 and 50 atoms , respectively ( fig . 1 and 2 in the supplemental material @xcite ) . the space group and thus the number of inequivalent carbon atoms ( 13 ) is the same in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt a lattice parameter of @xmath27=4.648 bohr , corresponding to a bond length of 2.683 bohr , while the cell size perpendicular to the graphene plane is set to c=37.794 bohr in order to prevent interactions between the periodically repeated layers . </S>",
    "<S> exchange - correlation effects are treated by the pbe functional @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the brillouin zone is sampled with an 8@xmath268@xmath261 k - point grid . </S>",
    "<S> the structures are relaxed down to a residual force lower than 0.0005 ha / bohr acting on each atom . </S>",
    "<S> interatomic distances between atoms of the relaxed structures , up to the seventh nearest neighbor , are given in table [ tab1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> upon relaxation , the atoms surrounding the vacancy move slightly away from it , thus shortening the bond lengths with the next nearest neighbors , @xmath28 , compared to the unperturbed system . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the vacancy extends up to the fourth neighbours , whereas it is almost negligible for more distant atoms ( more information about the relaxed structures can be found in the supplemental material @xcite ) . in the case of nitrogen doping , the substitutional atom does not strongly influence the atomic configuration of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this happens because the nitrogen - carbon bond length is just slightly shortened with respect to the carbon - carbon bond length in pristine graphene . for all the systems , we have investigated dipole - allowed transitions at the k - edge of carbon , assuming an incoming electron beam perpendicular to the graphene plane .    </S>",
    "<S> .[tab1 ] bond lengths between atoms up to the seventh nearest neighbor , @xmath29 , @xmath28 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , for graphene doped with nitrogen ( top row ) and with a vacancy ( bottom row ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 are the relative deviations from those of pristine graphene . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 indicates the defect site . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dos ] , the projected density of states ( pdos ) of pristine graphene ( upper panel ) and of the first nearest - neighbor atom for nitrogen - doped graphene ( middle panel ) and graphene with a single vacancy ( bottom ) , respectively , is plotted for empty states up to 12 ev above the fermi energy . here , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 represent the local cartesian coordinates at the individual atomic sites as determined by the point - group symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , @xmath38 is the axis perpendicular to the graphene , i.e. , ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) plane . </S>",
    "<S> all the other atoms of the defective systems exhibit a pdos with very similar character as in pristine graphene , besides the second and third nearest neighbors which are slightly affected by the defect @xcite .     </S>",

    "<S> note that , in the lower panel , the peak close to the fermi energy exceeds the boundary of the box , with a maximum at about 2 states / ev . in the case of pristine graphene , the red line indicates the sum of @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the three colored areas labeled as a , b , and c indicate the energy ranges for which the tem images have been calculated.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in pristine graphene , antibonding @xmath44 and @xmath45 states are clearly recognizable at about 2 ev and 9 ev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> as already reported in literature @xcite , the introduction of a vacancy or a substitutional nitrogen has a significant influence on the electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> a consequence of the doping atom is lifting the degeneracy of @xmath39 and @xmath40 that is significant for the first nearest neighbors ( middle panel in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dos ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is particularly evidenced by the appearance of bands at about 5 ev , which exhibit @xmath40 character . here , </S>",
    "<S> three different regions can be easily identified : a ) from 0 ev to 4 ev , the bands have only @xmath41 character ; energy ranges that present such dos character will be referred to as @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> b ) for energies higher than 6 ev , there are contributions from @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the only difference to ideal graphene is the lifted degeneracy of @xmath39 and @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this defines a new kind of region , named @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> c ) between 4 ev and 6 ev , the @xmath39 character of the first nearest neighbor is much less pronounced than that of @xmath40 , while all the other atoms have only @xmath41 character ; this region will be referred to as @xmath48 . in the case of graphene with a vacancy </S>",
    "<S> , the same kinds of regions can be identified , but corresponding to different energy ranges . here , the @xmath49 type is found between 0.5 ev and 7 ev ; @xmath47 encompasses energies above 7 ev ; @xmath48 is a small energy window , just few tenths of ev close to the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> we find similar kinds of dos characters also for damaged nitrogen - doped graphene , i.e. , graphene with a substitutional nitrogen and a vacancy located near it ; such defects have beed recently reported in tem measurements of nitrogen - doped graphene @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> details of this calculation and the corresponding simulated tem images can be found in the supplemental material @xcite .    to investigate the impact of the local electronic structure ( pdos ) on the eftem images , we first consider the ideal case of a perfect microscope with an acceleration voltage of 300 kev . in this case , the recorded images correspond to the intensity of the exit wavefunction in the multislice simulation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the finite resolution of the spectrometer is taken into account by simulating images every 0.05 ev in 2 ev - broad energy ranges ( regions a , b , and c in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_theo ] ) and then summing them up to get the final images . </S>",
    "<S> each image is shown in contrast - optimized grayscale .     </S>",
    "<S> simulated real - space intensity of the electron s exit wave function after propagation of an incident planewave through a graphene layer in presence of a nitrogen substitutional atom ( upper panels ) and a vacancy ( bottom panels ) . </S>",
    "<S> the colored lines indicate the energy regions highlighted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dos].,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    first , we analyze graphene with nitrogen doping ( fig . [ fig_theo ] , upper panels ) . here , in the region close to the fermi level ( a in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dos ] ) there are only contributions from @xmath41 orbitals . the image is then formed by disk - like features where their arrangement clearly visualizes the missing atoms ( upper left panel in fig . [ fig_theo ] ) . at an energy loss between 4 and 6 ev above the carbon k - edge </S>",
    "<S> ( region b in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dos ] ) , there is a @xmath48-like region . we expect to see contributions from @xmath40 of the atom closest to the nitrogen , but no ( or very little ) signal coming from the other atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this happens because @xmath40 lies on a plane perpendicular to the incoming electron beam and its magnitude is more intense than the one of @xmath41 ; thus its contribution to the final signal overcomes the one from @xmath41 states . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , only the @xmath40 orbitals of the three atoms surrounding the nitrogen are visible , which are pointing towards the defect , as imposed by the local @xmath50 symmetry ( upper middle panel in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_theo ] ) . at an excitation energy between 8 and 10 ev above the k - edge ( region c in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dos ] ) , instead , there are contributions from all the @xmath2 states . since , however , @xmath39 and @xmath40 lie in a plane perpendicular to the beam axis , their contribution to the final signal dominates over the one from @xmath41 states . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the image is composed of ring - like features , stemming solely from @xmath39 and @xmath40 states , arranged in hexagons ( upper right panel in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_theo ] ) . due to symmetry </S>",
    "<S> breaking , the intensity is not uniform , neither along a ring ( since @xmath39 and @xmath40 states are non - degenerate ) nor among different rings ( due to non - equivalent atomic sites ) .    the corresponding images for the system with a vacancy ( bottom panels in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_theo ] ) appear nearly identical to the ones above , but at different energy ranges . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood by comparing the pdos of the two systems . between 0 and 2 ev , </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we have a @xmath49-like region in the case of nitrogen - doped graphene , and both @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the case of graphene with a vacancy . </S>",
    "<S> due to the similarity of the two systems , we will , in the following , focus on doped graphene and show the corresponding analysis for graphene with a single vacancy in the supplemental material @xcite .    in order to predict the outcome of real experiments , we now visualize the effect of the optics aberrations and of a more realistic acceleration voltage on these images . </S>",
    "<S> we have simulated an electron - beam acceleration voltage of 80 kev and the operating parameters of two different kinds of microscopes , the fei tecnai g@xmath51 f20 and fei titan g@xmath51 60 - 300 . </S>",
    "<S> the former has a spherical aberration @xmath52 = 1.2 mm , corresponding to a an extended scherzer defocus of 849 @xmath53 , while the latter is a last - generation aberration - corrected microscope , i.e. , exhibiting no spherical and chromatic aberrations . in view of that </S>",
    "<S> , chromatic aberrations are not included in the calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the images corresponding to the energy regions a , b , and c are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_exp_n ] .     simulated tem image of nitrogen - doped graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the coloured lines indicate the energy regions highlighted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_dos ] . </S>",
    "<S> 80 kev incident beam energy and lenses as in a titan ( upper panels ) and a tecnai microscope ( bottom panels ) were assumed.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    because of the lower resolution of the tecnai microscope , all the features are blurred ( lower panels ) compared to the ideal images . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> neither the atomic positions , nor the orbital shapes can be retrieved from them . on the other hand , images simulated by taking into account the aberration - corrected optics of the titan microscope are very sharp and let us identify all the features already observed for the idealized situation previously described . </S>",
    "<S> this can be easily seen , comparing the upper panels of figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_exp_n ] and [ fig_theo ] . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , at an energy loss of 5 ev ( region b ) , the @xmath40 orbitals are visible , as in the ideal images . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly demonstrates the potential ability of aberration - corrected microscopes to visualize atomic orbitals with eftem , especially in a system like graphene . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion also holds when considering noise caused by the finite electron dose ( see supplemental material @xcite for corresponding images ) .    in summary , we have predicted the possibility of performing orbital mapping in low - dimension systems using eftem and we have demonstrated it with the prototypical example of defective graphene . in particular , we have shown that , as far as the optics is concerned , reasonable image resolution may already nowadays be experimentally achievable with last generation aberration - corrected microscopes like a fei titan g@xmath51 60 - 300 and even more with improved instruments of the next generation . </S>",
    "<S> however , additional work is necessary to reduce artifacts such as noise , drift , instabilities and damage . </S>",
    "<S> the inelastic cross section for the carbon k - edge ionisation is about a factor of 10 smaller than the elastic scattering cross section on a carbon atom @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity collected within an energy window of 2 ev as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_theo ] is @xmath545% of the total k - edge intensity . </S>",
    "<S> so , order - of - magnitude - wise , in order to obtain the same snr as in elastic imaging , we need at least 200 times more incident dose which means a dwell time of the order of several minutes for last generation tems in eftem mode . </S>",
    "<S> there is no fundamental law that would forbid such an experiment with today s equipment ; however , it is hampered by drift ( which must be well below the interatomic distance during the exposure time ) , instabilities , and radiation damage . </S>",
    "<S> a new route to circumvent radiation damage based on an eftem low - dose technique was proposed recently @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this may solve the problem in future .    </S>",
    "<S> we have identified three different kinds of images that are expected to be acquired in an eftem experiment , depending on the character of the dos : when only @xmath41 states are present in the electronic structure , the corresponding images are composed of disk - like features . </S>",
    "<S> when the dos is characterized by contributions from all @xmath2 states , ring - like features are seen that , however , only originate from a convolution of @xmath39 and @xmath40 states , while the @xmath55 character is not visible . </S>",
    "<S> when the @xmath40 character strongly exceeds the one of @xmath39 , only a single orbital is recorded . </S>",
    "<S> we expect this work to trigger new experiments on defective graphene and similar systems . </S>"
