    "the present approach may thus contribute to a semiclassical unterstanding of decoherence effects in regular cavities.@xcite + in the present treatment of diffractive scattering , both internal diffraction at the open lead mouth giving rise to pseudo - paths as well as the coupling between leads and cavity was performed for sharp edges .",

    "this behavior originates from treating the diffraction at the lead as two independent local phenomena of diffraction at two separate wedges .",

    "fig : diff_wedge ] ( a ) ] , because this is in proximity of the shadow boundary , into which the horizontal paths are scattered .",
    "this problem can be overcome by invoking the uniform theory of diffraction ( utd ) .",
    "+ contrary to the gtd , the utd is also valid on the zone boundaries .",
    "the outgoing cylindrical wave is multiplied by a diffraction coefficient which depends not only on the two angles @xmath247 and @xmath248 but also on the distances @xmath249 and @xmath250 , and on the wavenumber @xmath38 , @xmath251 where @xmath252 and @xmath253 is the integer which most closely satisfies @xmath254 .",
