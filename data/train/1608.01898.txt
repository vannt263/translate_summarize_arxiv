    "in this paper we study bifurcation equations and transversality conditions for local bifurcations of @xmath0-periodic points in one - dimensional discrete dynamical systems defined implicitly , with @xmath0 a positive integer .",
    "in particular , we focus our attention on the fold , transcritical , pitchfork and flip , i.e. , the most frequently found in applications .",
    "the main result of the paper is to obtain expressions for the general bifurcation equations and transversality conditions in dynamical systems defined implicitly .",
    "implicitly defined discrete and continuous dynamical systems are not very well studied , only very recently albert luo published _ the first monograph to discuss the implicit mapping dynamics of periodic flows to chaos _ @xcite .",
    "the singularities of some implicit continuous dynamical systems in dimension two have been addressed in @xcite , namely the clairaut system .",
    "nevertheless , it is an interesting and open field of research .",
    "this type of dynamical system appears in applications , namely in the theory of pde in the works of sharkovsky and co - workers @xcite , in mathematical economics directly @xcite or in the context of backward dynamics @xcite .",
    "it appears also in the context of control theory @xcite .",
    "these implicit dynamical systems appear also in numerical methods for ordinary differential equations , v.g . , the backward euler , the trapezoid method @xcite and the runge - kutta implicit method , see the recent article @xcite .",
    "implicit numeric methods are very useful when the original equations exhibit stiffness , see for instance @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the implicit euler method was used in a concrete mechanical problem .",
    "some implicit iterative schemes were transformed in forward dynamical systems using numerical methods , v.g . , newton method , @xcite . in implicit numerical schemes",
    "it is possible to prove the existence of period doubling when the step size parameter increases as we do with a simple example at the end of this article .",
    "it is also interesting to see the existence of chaos when the parameter @xmath1 is big enough , but still relatively small .",
    "the case of @xmath0-periodic points with @xmath2 , is very intricate , the computations increase its complexity extraordinary with the powers of the normal form , as we can see in this paper in the case of the pitchfork .",
    "for that reason , we study codimension @xmath3 cases , the most common in applications .",
    "the study of one - dimensional bifurcations makes sense , since many higher order systems can be reduced @xcite to lower order dimensional dynamics via center manifold and poincar map techniques as in @xcite , using spectral properties and quasi - periodicity @xcite , and in periodic non - autonomous systems using floquet theory @xcite .",
    "it is completely open and would be interesting to investigate the invariance of the bifurcation equations for periodic non - autonomous systems defined implicitly in the line of work of @xcite .",
    "one of the main reasons of this paper is to provide computational tools for the applied researcher dealing with implicitly defined dynamical systems .",
    "it is possible to study the bifurcations that can occur without the knowledge of an explicit difference equation .",
    "all the formulae are programmable using the usual platforms available for mathematicians .",
    "the examples where prepared using wolfram mathematica 10.0 .",
    "we follow the terminology of @xcite .",
    "we organized this paper in four sections . in section [ sectionprelim ]",
    "we introduce basic concepts .    in section 3 ,",
    "the core of this work , we study in detail the equations of bifurcation for @xmath0-periodic orbits of implicitly defined dynamical systems .    in section 4 we present examples , namely on the euler method for numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations . in the implicit difference equations of numerical methods we show the existence of bifurcation depending on the step size parameter @xmath1 , and the existence of chaos even in very simple examples .",
    "we define implicitly a discrete dynamical system using instead of the classic definition@xmath4 the alternative one@xmath5 where @xmath6 is a real interval ( not necessarily compact and maybe @xmath7 ) , where we input @xmath8 and solve for @xmath9 giving an initial condition @xmath10 .",
