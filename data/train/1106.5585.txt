    "in the last two decades , the nonperturbative renormalization group ( nprg ) approach has been successfully applied to many areas of physics,@xcite from high - energy physics to statistical and condensed - matter physics .",
    "it has proven to be a powerful tool to study not only the low - energy long - distance properties in the vicinity of second - order phase transitions but also non - universal quantities .",
    "in particular , the nprg approach has been implemented in lattice models and used to compute the transition temperature and the magnetization in classical spin models ( ising , xy and heisenberg models).@xcite this implementation of the nprg is referred to as the lattice nprg .",
    "the strategy of the nprg is to build a family of models indexed by a momentum scale @xmath2 , such that fluctuations are smoothly taken into account as @xmath2 is lowered from a microscopic scale @xmath3 down to 0 . in practice",
    "this is achieved by adding to the action @xmath4 of the system an infrared regulator term @xmath5 which vanishes for @xmath6 . for a scalar field theory ,",
    "the regulator term is a mass - like term @xmath7=\\half \\sum_\\q \\varphi_{-\\q } r_k(\\q ) \\varphi_\\q$ ] , where the cutoff function @xmath8 is chosen such that @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 , which effectively suppresses the low - energy modes @xmath10 .",
    "one can then define a scale - dependent partition function @xmath13 $ ] and a scale - dependent effective action @xmath14 $ ] defined as a slightly modified legendre transform ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec_ea ] for the precise definition ) of @xmath15 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath16 is an external source which couples linearly to the @xmath17 field and @xmath18/\\delta j(\\r)$ ] . in the standard implementation of the nprg , at the microscopic scale @xmath19 ,",
    "all fluctuations are frozen by the @xmath20 term so that @xmath21=s[\\phi]$ ] as in landau s ( mean - field ) theory of phase transitions .",
    "the effective action of the original model is obtained for @xmath6 ( @xmath22 ) and can be determined by ( approximately ) solving the rg equation satisfied by @xmath23.@xcite    the lattice nprg differs from the standard implementation in the initial condition.@xcite the cutoff function @xmath8 is chosen such that at the microscopic scale @xmath19 the action @xmath24 corresponds to the local limit of decoupled sites .",
    "local fluctuations are therefore included from the very beginning of the rg procedure .",
    "the intersite coupling is then gradually restored as @xmath2 decreases from @xmath3 down to 0 . in the low - energy limit @xmath25 , @xmath8 acts as an infrared regulator suppressing fluctuations with momenta @xmath10 .",
    "the lattice nprg is then equivalent to the standard nprg and yields identical results for the critical properties .",
    "the hallmark of the lattice nprg is thus to take into account both local and critical fluctuations in a nontrivial way .    in this paper",
    ", we present a nprg study of the bose - hubbard model@xcite at zero temperature and in dimension @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "this model has been intensively studied in the last years following the experimental observation of the superfluid  mott - insulator transition of an ultracold bosonic gas in an optical lattice.@xcite phase diagram and thermodynamic quantities are known from the numerically exact lattice quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations.@xcite on the other hand few studies have addressed the critical behavior at the superfluid  mott - insulator transition,@xcite and most of our understanding goes back to the seminal work of fisher _ et al._@xcite    the standard nprg scheme does not capture the superfluid  mott - insulator transition in the bose - hubbard model .",
    "the reason is that near the transition the mean - field solution is too far away from the actual state of the system to provide a reliable initial condition for the nprg procedure .",
    "the two - pole structure of the local ( on - site ) single - particle propagator is crucial for the very existence of the transition ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "it is however impossible to reproduce this structure from a rg approach starting from the mean - field ( bogoliubov ) theory within standard approximations of the rg equation satisfied by the effective action @xmath23 .",
    "this prevents a straightforward generalization of recent nprg studies@xcite of interacting bosons to the bose - hubbard model .",
    "by contrast the lattice nprg , which takes into account local fluctuations , is able to describe the superfluid  mott - insulator transition.@xcite since the starting action @xmath24 is purely local , this approach is to some extent reminiscent of various @xmath28 expansions of the bose - hubbard model.@xcite moreover , the lattice nprg is not restricted to the computation of thermodynamic quantities and allows us to study the critical behavior at the superfluid  mott - insulator transition and compare with the predictions of fisher _ et al._@xcite based on scaling arguments .",
    "in addition to the phase diagram and the critical behavior at the superfluid  mott - insulator transition , the nprg approach can also address the superfluid phase .",
    "deep in the superfluid phase , localization effects are negligible and we expect the bogoliubov theory to provide a good description of the system . however , even in this weak correlation limit , it is known that the bogoliubov approximation breaks down below a characteristic ( ginzburg ) momentum scale @xmath0 . in perturbation theory about the bogoliubov approximation ,",
    "the ginzburg scale manifests itself by the appearance of infrared divergences below three dimensions ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "although these divergences cancel out in local gauge invariant quantities ( condensate density , sound mode velocity , etc.),@xcite they do have a physical origin : they result from the coupling between longitudinal and transverse ( phase ) fluctuations and reflect the divergence of the longitudinal susceptibility@xcite  a general phenomenon in systems with a continuous broken symmetry.@xcite the normal and anomalous self - energies , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are non - analytic functions of @xmath32 and @xmath33 when @xmath34 and @xmath29 ( @xmath35 denotes the velocity of the sound mode ) , while @xmath36 vanishes,@xcite in marked contrast with the bogoliubov approximation where the linear spectrum and the superfluidity rely on a finite value of the anomalous self - energy .",
    "a weakly - correlated superfluid is defined by the condition @xmath37 where the healing scale @xmath1 is the inverse of the healing length @xmath38.@xcite in this case , the bogoliubov theory applies to a large part of the spectrum where the dispersion is linear ( @xmath39 ) and breaks down only at very low momenta @xmath40 .",
    "the goldstone regime @xmath40 , dominated by phase fluctuations , is conveniently described by popov s hydrodynamic theory ( free of infrared divergences ) based on a density - phase representation of the boson field @xmath41.@xcite the nprg approach yields a unified description of superfluidity which includes both bogoliubov theory ( valid for @xmath42 ) and popov s hydrodynamic approach ( valid for @xmath39).@xcite the bose - hubbard model gives us the opportunity to understand the fate of the weakly - correlated superfluid phase as we increase the strength of the interactions and move closer to the mott insulating phase in the phase diagram .",
