    "the rempi process provides very rich spectra containing information on not only the vibrational population distribution of the _ x _ state and the _ a _ state but also on the excited intermediate state via which ionization is performed .",
    "a major focus of the amo community in recent years has been on the production of the absolute ground state of ultracold heteronuclear molecules .",
    "such molecules may well be a stepping stone for the future realization of quantum computation and improved understanding of many - body physics .",
    "researchers all over the world have searched for different transfer pathways for the formation of these ground - state molecules , e.g. photoassociation @xcite and stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap ) . @xcite    our group at the university of connecticut has sought an efficient path for formation of absolute ground - state molecules of @xmath1k@xmath2rb using single - step pa .",
    "@xcite accurate knowledge of the excited electronic states is important to this research since the available _ ab initio _ potentials are not sufficiently accurate .",
    "hence , we have performed high resolution spectroscopy of various electronic states ( both excited and ground ) of krb over the years .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we report both experimental and theoretical investigations of the double - minimum @xmath12 electronic state of @xmath1k@xmath2rb , which may be useful in both the formation and detection of the _ x _ state and the _ a _ state .",

    "the dashed curves in fig . 2 show the resulting case ( a ) potentials . for the @xmath35 component",
    "this procedure is impossible because the required 9(1 ) state has not been calculated , so instead we approximate the case ( a ) potential by directly using the calculated potential curve of the hund s case ( b ) @xmath12 state , which is shown by the dashed curve in panel ( c ) .",
    "this approximation is reasonable because the case ( b ) potential curve represents the weighted average of all spin - orbit components , which should lie close to the middle @xmath35 component .",

    "the much larger molecular fine - structure must gradually converge to this small value as the potentials approach their asymptotes .",
    "this is quantitatively represented in figure 4 , which shows that the spin - orbit splittings are largest ( @xmath1740 @xmath15 ) near the bottom of the well ( @xmath175  ) and decrease rapidly at long range .",

    "the set of three pa spectra with three different detection laser frequencies confirms the reproducibility of the spectral features both for the strong and the weak signals .",

    "the strongest transitions to the @xmath34 and 2 components of the @xmath12 state originate from @xmath67 and 24 of the @xmath68 state , and the strongest transitions to the @xmath43 component of the @xmath12 state originate from @xmath69 and 20 . in figure 6 , we indicate only the transitions which are unambiguously assignable from the vibrational levels @xmath70 of the triplet metastable state to the spin - orbit components of the @xmath12 state .",
    "the spectra are calibrated using atomic two - photon resonances , labeled by @xmath71  , which are visible because the long - time tail of the atomic rb@xmath22 time - of - flight distribution leaks into the time gate used for krb@xmath22 .",
    "the accuracy of the vibrational energies is determined by the rempi laser linewidth , which is 0.5 @xmath15 .",
    "the rempi signal strength is dependent on the combination of the efficiency of _ a_-state molecule formation in various @xmath72 levels by pa via the 5(1 ) , @xmath62 level and the efficiency of the bound - bound transitions between the vibrational levels of the @xmath68 and the @xmath0 states .",
    "0 mm   +     we have successfully assigned the vibrational levels @xmath4 of the @xmath73 and @xmath74 state and @xmath6 of the @xmath75 state . from these observed transitions we obtain the total energy ( e@xmath76 ) for a particular vibrational level @xmath59 which has a spread over its rotational levels ( @xmath60 ) ( these are not resolved due to the laser linewidth ) .",
    "the total energy is given by e@xmath77 t@xmath78b@xmath79 where t@xmath80 is the vibrational term energy and b@xmath79 is the rotational constant .",

    "we also compare the experimental values of @xmath89 and @xmath96g@xmath97 with theoretical predictions ( calculated using level @xcite ) based on the approximate curves described in section iii .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath89 , are higher than the experimental values obtained from experimental data by an average of @xmath17133.6 @xmath15 for the @xmath83 state , @xmath17139.3 @xmath15 for the @xmath84 state and @xmath17138.1 @xmath15 for the @xmath85 state .",
    "however the experimental vibrational spacings , @xmath96g@xmath97 , are within @xmath98 of the theoretical values , as can be seen in figure 7 .",
    "the dip in the plot of @xmath96g@xmath97 vs. energy near 16600 @xmath15 ( figure 7 ) is due to the double - minimum character of the potential , evident in figure 3 .",

    "we have not observed levels above @xmath107 of the @xmath0 states , only because rempi scans were not performed beyond the reported range .",
    "our inability to observe the levels @xmath93 and 1 is probably due to the lack of franck - condon overlap of these two levels with the @xmath108 levels .",
    "this is evident if we focus on the inner turning points ( r@xmath109 ) of the @xmath9 and @xmath12 states . as previously discussed , the @xmath9 state is mainly populated in the range @xmath53 .",
    "the corresponding inner turning points are r@xmath110=4.99  and r@xmath111=4.92  .",
    "however figure 8 indicates that the @xmath112 and 1 levels lie deep in the outer well at a distance larger than 4.99  , yielding a poor franck - condon overlap .",
    "these franck - condon factors ( fcfs ) have been calculated using level @xcite and are shown in figure 9 for transitions from @xmath106 and 24 to @xmath104 .",
    "the fcfs for the @xmath112 and 1 levels are negligible and for the @xmath113 level they are relatively weak , in agreement with our experimental observations and the above argument .",
    "the vibrational wavefunctions of the @xmath84 double - minimum state for @xmath114 , calculated using level @xcite . ]    also , to help characterize this double - well potential , figure 10 shows the vibrational wavefunctions of this state for all the observed vibrational levels .",
    "the outer well is deeper than the inner well as shown in figure 8 .",
    "thus the @xmath115 levels belong entirely to the outer well , while the @xmath86 wavefunction has a small penetration into the inner well , which is apparent from both its level position ( figure 7 ) and wavefunction ( figure 10 ) . above @xmath86 , the amplitude of",
    "the wavefunction gradually increases in the inner well region and from @xmath116 onwards the wavefunctions have a smooth envelope spanning both wells .",
    "the other spin - orbit components ( @xmath43 and 2 ) of the @xmath12 state should follow very similar arguments to those just discussed for @xmath34 .",
    "in conclusion , we have used rempi of ultracold @xmath1k@xmath2rb to observe the double minimum @xmath0 states vibrational levels @xmath4 of the @xmath34 and 2 components and @xmath6 of the @xmath43 spin component .",
    "molecules in the @xmath9 state are formed by use of a pa laser fixed at 12535.13 @xmath15 which corresponds to the @xmath117 level .",
    "we are able to assign the spin - orbit components of the @xmath12 state based on theoretical potentials obtained by modifying the existing _ ab initio _ potentials .",
    "@xcite also , we predict that the @xmath49 and the @xmath0 states may perturb each other at certain vibrational levels which needs further investigation .",
    "this new spectroscopic information for the excited electronic states of krb provides better understanding of this molecule .",
    "it removes the ambiguity in the electronic and vibrational energies of the excited states in this energy region , thus providing new opportunities for different transfer pathways for future experiments on ultracold molecules .",
