    "these numerical computations are expected to lead to a better understanding of ideal knots . in this sense a numerical shape is `` good '' , if it leads to more insight about properties of ideal knots .",

    "does this sequence close to a cycle ? in this article we observe that computations suggest that the ideal trefoil knot has a periodic , and attracting nine - cycle of contact chords , as illustrated in figure [ fig : billiard ] .    a similar construction of periodic cycles , but in each point of the curve , helped to construct the ideal borromean rings @xcite .",
    "the existence of this cycle is significant because it partitions the trefoil in such a way that , using the apparent symmetries , it can be re - constructed from two unknown small pieces of curves mutually in contact .     of the nine - cycle @xmath8 partition the trefoil in 9 curves :",

    "another interesting discovery is that , if we follow the contact chords starting at an arbitrary point on the trefoil , we always end up at the previously mentioned cycle , in other words , it is a global attractor .    in order to present this closed cycle on the trefoil we first review the notions of global radius of curvature @xcite and contact of a curve @xcite in section [ sec : grc ] .",
