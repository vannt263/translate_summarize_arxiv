    "the collective behaviors of systems containing active ( self - propelled ) particles have gained extensive attention in recent years due to its great importance both from a fundamental physics perspective and for understanding many biological systems @xcite . a wealth of new nonequilibrium phenomena",
    "have been reported , such as active swarming , large scale vortex formation@xcite , phase separation@xcite , etc , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "recently , a new trend in this field has been the glassy dynamics and the glass transition in dense assemblies of self - propelled particles and their comparisons to their corresponding phenomena in equilibrium systems@xcite .",
    "experiments demonstrated that active fluids may show dynamic features such as jamming and dynamic arrest that are very similar to those observed in glassy materials .",
    "for instance , migrating cells exhibited glassy dynamics , such as dynamic heterogeneity as the cell density increases@xcite , amorphous solidification process was found in collective motion of a cellular monolayer@xcite , and glassy behaviors could even be found for ant aggregates in large scales@xcite , to list just a few .",
    "computer simulations also demonstrated that nonequilibrium glass transition or dynamic arrest behavior does occur in dense suspensions of self - propelled particles .",
    "so far , mainly two types of self - propulsion particle systems have been studied .",
    "one is the rotation diffusional active brownian ( rab ) particles system , where each particle is subjected to a self - propulsion force with constant amplitude @xmath12 but a randomly changing direction evolving @xmath13 rotational diffusion with diffusion coefficient @xmath14 .",
    "_ et al_. @xcitestudied the glassy behavior of this rab system of hard - sphere particles , finding that the critical density for glass transition shifts to larger density as the active force increases , thus pushing the glass transition point to the limit of random packing .",
    "the other one is the so - called active ornstein - uhlenbeck(aou ) particles system , wherein the self - propulsion force is realized by a colored noise described by the ou process .",
    "in contrast to the rab model , thermal noise is ignored in the aou system , such that the system can never reach the equilibrium state determined by the canonical distribution . for this athermal system",
    ", an effective temperature @xmath7 can be introduced to quantify the strength of the self - propulsion force , and a persistence time @xmath6 controls the duration of the persistent self - propelled motion .",
    "berthier and co - workers@xcite had performed detailed studies about the structural and glassy dynamics of this aou model in two and three dimensions .",
    "similarly , the glass transition shifts to larger densities compared to the equilibrium one when the magnitude or persistence time of cthe self - propulsion force increases .",
    "besides the studies of self - propelled particles , using molecular dynamics simulations of a model glass former , mandal _",
    "et al_.@xcite showed that the incorporation of activity or self - propulsion can induce cage breaking and fluidization , resulting in a disappearance of the glassy phase beyond a critical force . and related to the glassy dynamics , it was shown that particle activity can shift the freezing density to larger values@xcite and particularly , hydrodynamic interactions can further enhance this effect@xcite .",
    "besides experimental and simulation studies mentioned above , on the theoretical side , important progresses have also been achieved in recent years@xcite .",
    "starting from a generalized langevin equation with colored non - thermal noise , berthier and kurchan@xcite predicted that dynamic arrest can occur in systems that are far from equilibrium , showing that non - equilibrium glass transition moves to lower temperature with increasing activity and to higher temperature with increasing dissipation in spin glasses .",
    "farage and brader attempted to extend the mode coupling theory to the limiting case of the rab model@xcite , wherein activity leads to a higher effective particle diffusivity .",
    "they then started from the effective smoluchowski equation governing the many - particle distribution function and obtained a memory function equation for the equilibrium intermediate scattering function , showing that self - propulsion could shift the glass transition to larger density@xcite .",
    "in a recent work , nandi proposed a phenomenological extension of random first order transition theory to study glass transition of the rab model , showing that more active systems are stronger glass formers @xcite .",
    "very recently , szamel _ _ et al.__@xcite presented an elegant theoretical modeling of the structure and glassy dynamics of the athermal aou system . in their approach , they first integrated out the self - propulsion and then used the projection operator method and a mode - coupling - like approximation to derive an approximate equation of motion for the collective intermediate scattering functions , defined upon the nonequilibrium steady state distribution .",
    "in particular , this work highlighted the importance of the steady state correlations of particle velocities , which played a crucial role to understand the relaxation dynamics of the system .",
    "nevertheless , extension of this framework to more general cases with thermal noise included is not present yet .    in the present work ,",
    "we have developed an alternative mode coupling theory for the nonequilibrium glass dynamics of a general system of active particles , wherein the self - propulsion force is described by an ou process , and besides , thermal noise is included . to be specific",
    ", we call this active ou particles system with thermal noise presented as the aou - t system , where t apparently stands for thermal noise .",
    "our starting point is an effective smoluchowski equation(se ) obtained _ via _ fox approximation method , which was recently adopted by farage _",
    "et al_. to study the effective interactions among rab particles@xcite .",
    "this effective se allows us to derive a memory function equation for the nonequilibrium steady state collective intermediate scattering function @xmath15 , as well as that for the self - intermediate scattering function @xmath16 . with the basic assumptions of absence of macroscopic currents and standard mode coupling approximation , we are able to get the expressions for the irreducible memory functions and other relevant variables .",
    "particularly , we find that the dynamics is governed by an averaged diffusion coefficient @xmath0 and a nontrivial steady state structure function @xmath1 , both depending on the effective temperature @xmath7 , the persistence time @xmath6 as well as the number density @xmath8 . with @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the nonequilibrium structure factor @xmath17 as inputs",
    ", we can calculate @xmath15 and @xmath16 for different parameter settings and investigate the glass transition behaviors .",
    "we calculate the critical density @xmath9 for glass transition as a function of the effective temperature @xmath7 , the magnitude of propulsion force @xmath12 and the persistence time @xmath6 , by investigating the debye - waller factor @xmath4 as well as the relaxation time @xmath5 . consequently , @xmath9 shifts to larger values with increasing propulsion force @xmath12 or effective temperature @xmath7 , in good accordance with previous simulation works .",
    "the theory also facilitates us to study the critical temperature @xmath10 for fixed number density @xmath8 , as well as its dependence on @xmath6 .",
    "the remainder of paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present descriptions of the aou - t model and our theory , the latter being the main result of the present work .",
    "section iii includes the numerical results predicted by our theory and conclusions in section iv .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath18 interacting , self - propelled particles in a volume @xmath19 .",

    ", the self - propulsion force is given by a colored noise described by ou process and thermal noises are included .",

    "the thermal noise is absent , the effective temperature is simply given by @xmath49@xcite .",
    "we note here that the aou - t model can be mapped onto the rab model at a coarse - grained level@xcite .",

    "the authors usually used @xmath7 as one of the independent parameters together with the persistence time @xmath6 and number density @xmath60 . in the simulation works of the rab model , however , the authors often used the magnitude of the propulsion force @xmath12 as an independent parameter . note that in the simulation work performed by ran ni _",

    "the number density @xmath8 is set to be large enough such that the phase separation dynamics is not relevant and we mainly focus on the glassy dynamics .",
    "simulations are performed in a cubic box with @xmath74 and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the aou - t model described in eq.([eq : aou - t-1 ] ) is non - markovian due to the colored noise term @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , it is not possible to derive an exact fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) for the time evolution of the probability distribution function @xmath75 , which gives the probability that the system is at a specific configuration @xmath76 at time @xmath77 .",
    "nevertheless , one may obtain an approximate fpe for such a colored noise system by applying the method introduced by fox@xcite , where a perturbative expansion in powers of correlation time is partially resumed using functional calculus .",
    "the resulting fpe thus defines implicitly a markovian process , and is shown to be rather accurate for short correlation time of the colored noise .",
    "very recently , t. farage and co - workers had applied such a method to the rab model and obtained an effective fpe for @xmath75 , and analyzed the effective interaction among active particles in the low density limit .",
    "since the fpe only involves the distribution in the configuration space @xmath78 , it is also known as smoluchowski equation ( se ) .",
    "here we use the same method to obtain the approximate se of the aou - t model .",
    "the procedure is similar to that in ref.@xcite noting that the aou - t model can be mapped to the rab model as discussed in the last subsection . for self - consistency ,",
