    "the study of nonlinear problems is of crucial importance in all areas of physics .",
    "some of the most interesting features of physical systems are hidden in their nonlinear behavior , and can only be studied with appropriate methods designed to tackle nonlinear problems . in general , given the nature of nonlinear phenomena , the approximation methods can only be applied within certain ranges of the physical parameters and or to only certain classes of problems .",
    "it is a challenge to devise nonlinear frameworks that contain both operational ease and flexibility in their application . in this paper",
    "we present a method for the solution of nonlinear problems that attempts to accomplish these features .",
    "there are several methods which have been used to find approximate solutions to nonlinear problems . here",
    "we just review a few .",
    "lindstedt developed a method long time ago  @xcite in which one considers solutions to problems involving conservative oscillatory systems with an unknown period .",
    "the main observation is that by introducing a rescaled time , one can avoid the appearance of terms indefinitely growing with time ( `` secular terms '' ) , that are common in ordinary perturbation theory .",
    "the method is now know as the lindstedt - poincar ( lp ) method or as the distorted time method .",
    "another known technique is the perturbative @xmath0 expansion ( see for example  @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the idea is to modify the exponent of the nonlinear term by introducing a parameter @xmath0 as new exponent .",
    "@xmath0 interpolates between the linear ( @xmath1 ) and the nonlinear ( @xmath2 ) problems .",
    "if one is able to solve the linear problem then the original nonlinear problem becomes , after a power expansion in @xmath0 , an infinite sequence of linear problems which are ( formally ) solvable .",
    "yet another framework is the multiple - scale perturbation theory ( mspt )  @xcite . in this case",
    ", one tackles problems in which a dynamical system has physical behaviors at various length or time scales .",
    "this is usually problematic for ordinary perturbation theory due to the appearance ( again ) of secular terms .",
    "the central idea is to introduce more than one time and to treat them as independent variables . by performing the usual perturbative expansion",
    ", one then imposes conditions on the solutions ( which depend on the different `` times '' ) in order to get rid of secular terms and a linear differential equation is left to solve .    finally , the linear delta expansion ( lde )  @xcite .",
    "this is a method in which an arbitrary ( or several ) parameter @xmath3 is introduced into the problem and calculations are carried out with conventional perturbation theory in an expansion parameter @xmath4 . at each order in @xmath0 ,",
    "the convergence of the approximation can be improved by applying the principal of minimal sensitivity which consists on a minimization of an observable with respect to the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "all of these methods have been applied to a variety of problems . in  @xcite ,",
    "bender et al . showed how one can obtain approximate solutions using the perturbative @xmath0 expansion and the mspt to the duffing equation ( the classical anharmonic oscillator ) .",
    "its success then has motivated their extension of the method into quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "the lde method has extensively been applied in many different settings with varying degrees of success .",
    "for example , in  @xcite it has been used to analyze disordered systems .",
    "pinto and collaborators have applied it to the bose - einstein condensation problem  @xcite , the @xmath5 model  @xcite , to the walecka model  @xcite and to the @xmath6 theory at high temperature  @xcite .",
    "detailed references can be found in these works .",
    "we can see that it is possible to tackle a large number of nonlinear problems with these well known techniques .",
    "however , there is still room for substantial improvement over them . as mentioned before",
    ", it is desirable to have a method that works over a large range of parameters , which is not always the case in the aforementioned methods , and we would like the new method to give a smaller error in the approximations than its competitors .",
    "it is also desirable to devise a framework with operational flexibility and so easy to adapt to many different problems .",
    "we show that the method presented in this paper accomplishes these features in the case of the duffing equation and of the nonlinear pendulum .",
    "the method is based on the application of the lde to the lp method  @xcite .",
    "we find solutions that are better behaved and that converge much faster than in the other methods described .    in section  [ sec : lp ] a brief review of the lp method",
    "is presented followed by a review of the lde method in section  [ sec : lde ] .",
    "we then show the application of both methods to two problems , the anharmonic oscillator in section  [ sec : ao ] , and the nonlinear pendulum in section  [ sec : np ] .",
    "we present our conclusions and current work in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "appendix a contains some of the formulae employed in the computations .",
    "in this section we introduce the lindstedt - poincar distorted time ( lp ) method @xcite .",
    "we consider a nonlinear ode of the form ( t ) + ^2  x(t ) =  f(x(t ) )  , [ lp1 ] which describes a conservative system , oscillating with an unknown period @xmath7 .",
    "the nonlinear term @xmath8 is treated as a perturbation . unfortunately , when the ordinary perturbation is applied to eq .",
    "( [ lp1 ] ) , by writing the solution as a series in @xmath9 , the appearance of secular terms spoils the expansion and any predictive power is lost for sufficiently large time scales .    in order to avoid the appearance of secular terms",

    "the ode now reads : ^2 ( ) + ^2  x ( ) =  f(x ( ) )  .",
    "[ lp2 ]    we notice that the dependence upon @xmath9 in this equation enters both in the solution @xmath11 and in the frequency @xmath12 . by assuming @xmath9 to be a small parameter we write ^2 & = & _ n=0^  ^n  _",

    "the presence of a driving term with the fundamental frequency leads to a resonant behavior of @xmath19 and to the unfortunate occurrence of secular terms , which spoils our expansion .",

    "eventually @xmath0 is set to be @xmath29 .",
    "we notice that the interpolation of the full lagrangian with the solvable one , @xmath25 , brings an artificial dependence upon the arbitrary parameter @xmath3",
    ". such dependence , which would vanish if all perturbative orders were calculated , can be soften to a finite perturbative order , by requiring some physical observable @xmath30 to be locally insensitive to @xmath3 , i.e : = 0 .",
    "this condition is known as principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) and is normally seen to improve the convergence to the exact solution .",
    "in this section we apply the lde to the lp method in order to find approximate solutions to the duffing equation , a problem which has already been considered in @xcite ; here we present the calculation in more detail .",
