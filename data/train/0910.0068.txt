    "the standard model of particle physics have been a successful theory to describe the observed experimental data till date .",
    "however there are theoretical issues such as matter - antimatter asymmetry and experimental issues such as finiteness of electric dipole moment ( edm ) and anomalous magnetic moment which hints for beyond standard model physics in the form of cp violation .",
    "though small in nature , as hinted by the present experimental bounds , it can be probed by proper choice of momentum dependent cp violating observables .",
    "because of small nature of cp violating effects , it it worthwhile to consider processes which could be helpful in measuring these effects directly .",
    "one such possibility to test such direct effects is the study of processes involving tops .",
    "this is because of ( a ) top - pair events are highly abundant at the lhc with a rate of @xmath3 pairs per year , and also , ( b ) top are short lived with a life - time smaller by one order of the qcd scale and hence they decay much before hadronization .",
    "in a model independent approach without having any additional non - standard particle contents , the @xmath1 violation is parametrized by anomalous top - quark couplings affecting both the production and decay vertices @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 production process is modified relative to the sm by the interaction    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the strong coupling constant and @xmath7 is the usual gluon field strength tensor . for the decay process @xmath8",
    ", the most general decay vertex takes the following form  @xcite    @xmath9   u(p_t ) .",
    "\\label{ftilde } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    we use @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 as in the sm , and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 as @xmath1 violating and cp conserving phases respectively . in a similar way @xmath17 decay vertex can also be written .    at the lhc ,",
    "most of the top pair production events are due to gluon - fusion , which amounts to @xmath18 of the total top - pairs .",
    "therefore throughout this talk , we consider only on the subprocess involving gluons as initial state . also since we found that final dimuonic mode is the cleanest at the lhc , we restricted our studies to the process : @xmath2 .",
    "for the aforementioned process , the relevant correlation which does not require intermediate state reconstructions , as obtained in ref  @xcite are    @xmath19    the integrated asymmetries @xmath20 , corresponding to observables @xmath21 integrated counting asymmetries , @xmath20 , can be defined as    @xmath22    it is interesting to note that , from the experimental perspective , @xmath23 is most desirable as it does not require distinction between b and anti - b jets .",
    "when cp - violation occurs due to top decays , the spin and color averaged matrix element squared containing the @xmath0-odd correlations can be written as  @xcite    @xmath24    in this expression , first term contains information due to one decay vertex while the other term due to other .",
    "clearly , we can not compare top and anti - top decays with the use of observables mentioned earlier in this talk .",
    "this means we need to define additional observables which could measure asymmetries corresponding to cp violating phases as well as cp conserving phases .",
    "observables corresponding to cp violating phases are  @xcite    @xmath25    in the later part of this talk i will mention that we need to define a couple of more observables which carry information on strong cp violating phases .",
    "we studied cp violating asymmetries using madgraph  @xcite .",
    "our strategy was as follows : we first generated sm matrix - element squared for the aforementioned process and then add the contributions due to cp violating part as mentioned in ref .",
    "/citegerman .",
    "we noted that the major background for the process under consideration is due to @xmath26 , with minimal acceptance cuts the cross - sections at the lhc are 4.3 pb and 24 pb which after implementing the basic cuts mentioned in the ref .",
    "/citeours and a missing energy cut @xmath27 reduce to 2.3 pb and 0 respectively .    in order to estimate asymmetries , we generated @xmath28 events for each of the four cases : @xmath29 ; @xmath30 ; @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which correspond to @xmath1 violation in the production vertex , @xmath1 violation in the decay vertex , strong phases in the decay vertex and the lowest order sm respectively .",
    "the largest asymmetry for a @xmath33 coupling is @xmath34 but this is helpful only if we could distinguish clearly between b and anti - b jets . in figure",
    "[ f : fig1 ] we show the differential distributions @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 as well as @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "we found that with one year of lhc run ( which corresponds to integrated lumionosity = @xmath41 ) , 5@xmath42 sensitivity requires @xmath43 . using this ,",
    "we obtain @xmath44 strong interaction phases ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in order to isolate true @xmath1 violation from the @xmath0 -odd triple products , we construct two cp - even observables which is based on the most sensitive observable to phases in decay vertex .",
    "these are      proceeding as in the previous section we found that the larger of these two asymmetries we can write @xmath46 from which we conclude that the lhc with @xmath47 will have a @xmath48 sensitivity to @xmath49 summary and conclusion ----------------------                j.  f.  donoghue and g.  valencia , phys .",
