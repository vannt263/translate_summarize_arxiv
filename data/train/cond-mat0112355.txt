    "in polymeric systems one often encounters phase equilibria in mixtures with a large number of components . for instance , polydispersity ( i.e. a continuous distribution of chain lengths ) alters the phase equilibrium between a dense polymer phase and its vapour .",
    "random ab copolymers constitute another example of such mixtures , each sequence of a s and b s represents a different component .",
    "the phase behaviour of random copolymers has attracted abiding interest , because these systems are produced commercially in large amounts and exhibit a rich phase behaviour .",
    "mean field calculations @xcite predict a disordered phase , a macrophase separated phase and a disordered microphase separated phase , as a function of the incompatibility @xmath1 of the constituents a and b and the correlation @xmath0 along the polymers .",
    "we present the first monte carlo study of the phase behaviour of random copolymers melts and compare our results to the mean field predictions . for rather short chain lengths",
    "we observe all three phases predicted by the mean field theory , but the region of stability of the macrophase separation is much smaller than predicted . increasing the chain length ,",
    "we reduce the region of macrophase separation and increase the deviation from the mean field prediction .",
    "our simulation results indicate that random copolymer melts are one of the very few dense polymer systems for which mean field predictions do not become accurate , even if the chains strongly interdigitate and interact with many neighbours .",
    "this finding is corroborated by the ginzburg criterium  @xcite .",
    "the layout of our paper is as follows : in the next section we briefly describe the model and summarise the mean field results pertinent to our computer simulation study .",
    "we give some details about the simulation technique @xcite in the following section .",
    "the dependence of the phase diagram on the chain length and correlation length along the chain are discussed and our findings are rationalised in terms of a ginzburg criterium . the manuscript closes with a discussion and an outlook .",
    "we consider a dense mixture of linear random copolymers .",
    "all chains consist of a random sequence of @xmath2 blocks , each of which comprises either @xmath3 monomers of type a or @xmath3 monomers of type b. the sequence of @xmath2 blocks is characterised by the average composition @xmath4 ( fraction of a  monomers ) and the correlation parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the sequences of the polymers are once built by a random polymerisation process and are then kept fixed .",
    "the probability @xmath5 for an a  block to be followed by a b  block is @xmath6 and similarly @xmath7 ( of course , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) . for @xmath10 ,",
    "blocks are completely correlated and the model describes a binary mixture of homopolymers . for @xmath11 the polymers consist of a strictly alternating sequence of a and b  blocks . in the following ,",
    "we only consider the symmetric case @xmath12 and we denote the polymer length by @xmath13 .",
    "a and b  monomers repel each other , and the strength of the repulsion is parameterised by the flory ",
    "huggins parameter @xmath1 . upon increasing @xmath1 ,",
    "monomers of the same type segregate to lower the energy , and a rich phase behaviour is anticipated : within the mean field approximation , fredrickson , milner , and leibler  @xcite have calculated the free energy as a functional of the local composition @xmath14 . for symmetric composition",
    "@xmath12 it takes the form : @xmath15}{k_{\\rm b}t\\rho}=\\frac{1}{v}\\int { \\rm d}{\\bf r}\\;\\left\\ {   ( \\chi_c-\\chi)m^2+\\frac{4q}{m\\lambda^2}m^4 + \\chi_c \\gamma r_m^2(\\nabla m)^2 \\right\\ } , \\label{eqn : f}\\ ] ] with @xmath16 and @xmath17 $ ] for @xmath18  @xcite . @xmath19 is the radius of gyration of a block .",
    "we assume @xmath20 .",
    "otherwise the coefficient of the square gradient term becomes negative and higher derivatives have to be considered .    at large incompatibility @xmath21 ,",
    "there is macrophase separation .",
    "since the typical excess of a  monomers along a random copolymer is of order @xmath22 the difference of the composition of the two phases also is only proportional to @xmath23 and phase separation reduces the energy of a single molecule by @xmath24 independently of the number @xmath2 of blocks per chain .",
    "if @xmath1 is increased further , mean field theory predicts a second transition at @xmath25 where the two coexisting phases remix and form a microphase with no long ranged order .",
    "the characteristic length scale is set by the size @xmath19 of a block and becomes smaller as we increase @xmath1 .",
    "the stability region of the macrophase separation decreases with the number of blocks ; @xmath26/\\chi_c$ ] is of the order @xmath27 .",
    "it has been suggested that the role of fluctuations on the macrophase transition is similar to that of a binary mixture of homopolymers @xcite . in the homopolymer blend , there is only a very narrow non  classical region about the critical line that is inversely proportional to the chain length . for smaller correlations ,",
    "stronger fluctuation effects are anticipated . in particularly , the isotropic lifshitz point at @xmath28 does not survive fluctuations  @xcite and fluctuations will change the order of the transition towards the microphase separated state from second to first @xcite .",
    "in the monte carlo simulations we employ the bond fluctuation model  @xcite .",
    "monomers are represented by a cube on a 3d lattice and block its 8 corners from further occupancy .",
    "monomers along a polymer are connected via bond vectors of length 2 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , 3 and @xmath31 .",
    "interactions between monomers are modelled by a square well potential , which extends over the nearest 54 lattice sites .",
    "monomers of different types repel each other with an energy @xmath32  @xcite and we define @xmath33 .",
    "this is related to @xmath1 through @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of intermolecular contacts .",
    "this model is an ideal testing bed for comparing simulations to the predictions above .",
    "the phase behaviour  @xcite and interface properties  @xcite of homopolymer mixtures and diblock copolymers  @xcite have been studied in the framework of this coarse grained model , and the simulation results have been compared to mean field predictions of the gaussian chain model without any adjustable parameter .",
    "in fact , swift and olvera de la cruz  @xcite have used this model to investigate the behaviour of random copolymers . using a local hopping algorithm",
    ", they found evidence for microphase separation at @xmath36 and a substantially decrease of the centre of mass diffusion at low temperatures .",
    "the slow relaxation corroborates a frozen  in , glassy structure predicted for low temperatures @xcite . extracting the phase behaviour and",
    "its dependence on the chain length poses a challenge for computer simulations : ( i ) one needs an efficient update of the chain conformations on the lattice to reduce the protracted long time scales associated with the ( almost ) frozen structure .",
    "( ii ) the canonical ensemble is not well suited to investigate macrophase separation , because the two coexisting phases ( and the interfaces separating them ) are simultaneously present in the simulation cell .",
    "accurately extracting the phase boundaries from simulations in the canonical ensemble would require inaccessibly large simulation cells since we expect weak segregation and wide interfaces .",
    "( iii ) due to the finite size of the system , the actual mixture produced by the random polymerisation process deviates from the mean composition defined by @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "one should _ a priori _ average over different realisations of the disorder , considerably increasing the cpu time required . due to these computational difficulties , the way how fluctuations modify the phase behaviour predicted by mean field calculations could not be addressed in computer simulations .    to cope with the freezing of the structure , we employ a recently devised `` wormhole '' algorithm  @xcite , which generalises and improves the slithering snake algorithm for random copolymers .",
    "additionally , we use parallel tempering  @xcite to help the structure equilibrate at low temperatures ( large @xmath1 ) . generally , a grand - canonical simulation of a random copolymer mixture is not straightforward , because the mixture contains a large number of components ( i.e. different sequences ) .",
    "the density of the species is set by the disorder , but their ( temperature dependent ) chemical potentials are unknown . if we restrict ourselves , however , to symmetrical composition @xmath12 , the system is invariant under exchanging @xmath37 monomers .",
    "hence , it is possible to switch the identity of all monomers along one chain ( and accept this monte carlo move according the metropolis criterium ) .",
    "this moves relaxes the composition of the system , which is the order parameter of the macrophase separation . owing to this symmetry ,",
    "the system is either symmetric ( disordered or microphase separated state ) or it coexists with its symmetric in the two phase region .",
    "standard finite size scaling techniques of grand - canonical simulations can be applied to accurately locate the phase boundaries . finally to avoid the average over a large number of realisations of the disorder ( i.e. the sequences of the polymers )",
    ", we devised a method to produce a `` generic '' random copolymer mixture which does not present random fluctuations .",
    "more details on the simulation technique will be published elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we have simulated different sets of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , for a large number of values of @xmath38 and @xmath0 .",
    "we found the following : at small @xmath38 ( i.e. high temperature ) the system is homogeneous .",
    "provided that @xmath0 is large enough , the system phase separates when one increases the incompatibility ( i.e. decrease the temperature ) . finally , at an even larger @xmath38 , the system remixes .",
    "this is determined by looking at the distribution @xmath39 of the composition ( fig .",
    "[ fig_m ] ) .",
    "the macrophase separation is a standard ising - like second order phase transition and we accurately determine the transition temperature by mapping @xmath39 onto the known distribution of the 3d ising universality class . from a numerical point of view , the nature of the remixing transition is unclear , it could be a simple second order phase transition with strong finite size effects or there could be a region where more than two phases coexist .",
    "hence , error bars in the temperature of remixing are much larger than for the unmixing at higher temperature . the snapshot in fig .",
    "[ fig_m ] shows a typical configuration in the low temperature phase .",
    "large domains can be observed which have a typical length scale several times larger than the end - to - end distance of one polymer . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath0 is small , we do not see any phase transition .",
    "the distribution @xmath39 simply broadens and narrows again as the temperature decreases .",
    "we determined the phase boundaries for different values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the topology of the phase diagram we found is similar to the one of a ternary mixture of two homopolymers and a diblock copolymer ( it is actually the special case @xmath40 and large @xmath3 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_mq ] using the scaling of mean field theory . on the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig_mq ] ( varying @xmath2 at constant @xmath3 ) , we see that the phase boundaries do not seem to scale as expected by mean field .",
    "the scaling in @xmath38 does not apply and as one increases @xmath2 the minimal value of @xmath41 for which we observe a phase separation goes to larger values of @xmath0 instead of going to @xmath42 .    in view of the unexpectedly large deviations between our simulations and the mean field predictions , we assess the validity of the latter approach via the ginzburg criterium .",
    "the mean field approximation is accurate , if fluctuations @xmath43 of the composition in a volume of the size of the correlation length @xmath44 are small compared to the difference of composition between the two coexisting phases . using the mean field functional ( equation  [ eqn : f ] ) we calculate the composition of the two coexisting phases : @xmath45 where @xmath46 denote the distance to the onset of macrophase separation .",
    "the correlation length above the critical temperature is given by @xmath47 and the critical amplitude is reduced by a factor @xmath48 below the critical point .",
    "the scale of the correlation length is set by the size of an individual block @xmath19 and does not depend on the number @xmath2 of blocks .",
    "the susceptibility above the critical point takes the form @xmath49 $ ] and the critical amplitude is a factor @xmath50 lower in the macrophase separated state . using these expressions",
    ", we obtain for the ginzburg criterium : @xmath51 the last factor measures the inverse degree of interdigitation of blocks .",
    "this factor resembles the behaviour of binary homopolymer blends , except for the important difference that it is only proportional to the inverse length of a block ( @xmath52 ) and not to that of the whole chain ( @xmath53 ) . in marked contrast to the homopolymer blend , the ginzburg number increases and the region of validity of the mean field theory decreases as we increase the number @xmath2 of blocks .",
    "our finding disagrees with previous estimates which assumed a behaviour similar to a binary mixture of homopolymers .",
    "we expect fluctuations to shift the macrophase separation to larger values of the incompatibility by an amount @xmath54 . for long random copolymers ( i.e. large @xmath2 )",
    "this shift exceeds by far the stability range of the macrophase separated state which is , in the framework of the mean field calculation , of order @xmath55 .",
    "of course , fluctuations also affect the onset of microphase separation and shift it to higher values of @xmath38 .",
    "our simulations , however , indicate that the stability region of the macrophase separation decreases with increasing number of blocks @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , the large @xmath3 behaviour ( at constant @xmath2 ) approaches the mean field predictions as can be seen on the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig_mq ] .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that @xmath56 as @xmath57 which indicates that mean field should be correct in this limit .",
    "this limit is not generic for copolymers built by random polymerisation of blocks because the size @xmath3 of the blocks would have to increase with increasing number of blocks .",
    "nevertheless the case @xmath40 corresponds to a ternary mixture of two homopolymers and a diblock copolymer in which case the @xmath57 is the relevent limit and is known to approach mean field  @xcite .",
    "using extensive monte carlo simulations , we have studied the phase diagram of random copolymer melts .",
    "the region where macrophase separation occurs is much smaller than predicted by mean field , and this region further shrinks as the number @xmath2 of blocks in the polymers increases .",
    "we can then conclude for this system that surprisingly , mean field becomes worse as the size of the polymers increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean field behaviour is recovered in the limit of large blocks ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "both observations are corroborated by the ginzburg criterium .",
    "the unexpected observation , that mean field theory fails to describe the qualitative behaviour in the limit of infinitely long chains , is traced back to the weak segregation and the small correlation length due to the disorder in the polymer sequences .",
    "future work should address three subjects not treated here : ( i ) the nature of the low temperature phase , in particular its spacial structure .",
    "( ii ) the type of the transition between the macrophase separated region and the low temperature phase .",
    "we are currently investigating the possible existence of a 3 phase region , using grand canonical simulations with chemical potentials ( at small @xmath2 to reduce the number of different chemical species ) .",
    "( iii ) the scaling of @xmath38 in the large @xmath2 regime .",
