    "in the past years , considerable effort has gone into the study of the existence of phases of strange matter in neutron stars @xcite .",
    "a macroscopic strangeness content is predicted to be energetically favorable at densities well beyond the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter ( hereafter @xmath0 ) .",
    "conditions with sufficiently high density and low enough electron chemical potential for the formation of a macroscopic content of strange quarks ( charge @xmath1 ) or particles containing such are obtained in the interior of a protoneutronstar ( hereafter pns ) after post - bounce times of several seconds .",
    "the three possible forms for the macroscopic manifestation of strangeness suggested are a @xmath2 condensate @xcite , the formation of hyperons @xcite and deconfined quark matter including strange quarks @xcite .",
    "the equation of state of matter at densities @xmath3 is not well enough known at this point to determine which of these scenarios will actually happen and what the order of the associated phase transition is .",
    "the present study limits itself to a certain class of scenarios which is common to all possible forms of strangeness in high density nuclear matter and which might be subject to experimental verification .",
    "i assume the phase transition to be first order and to result in the formation of a lattice in the coexistence region with different energy and charge densities of the strange and non - strange phases , as was recently predicted by various authors @xcite .",
    "typical results for the parameters of the mixed phase lattice , such as the size and spatial separation and the energy and charge densities are quoted from these authors .",
    "whereas all studies on this lattice to date are limited to cold , deleptonized neutron stars , my focus is on pns s in the kelvin - helmholtz cooling phase , @xmath4 post - bounce , for temperatures up to tens of @xmath5 . in particular",
    ", the present paper presents the mechanical properties of the structured mixed strange / non - strange phase as they are relevant to the further pns evolution and observational verification .",
    "many initial studies predicted phenomena caused by strangeness to be confined to a very small central region of the pns @xcite , which would most likely render their experimental verification impossible .",
    "however , glendenning showed in 1992 @xcite that the previous studies were too simplistic in their assumptions about the thermodynamic model of the pns .",
    "in particular , there are two conserved charges in pns matter , the baryon number and the electric charge and , therefore , two independent chemical potentials , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . during a phase transition ,",
    "their equality between the strange ( subscript @xmath8 ) and non - strange ( subscript @xmath9 ) phases , together with similar conditions for temperature and pressure , comprise the gibbs conditions @xcite : @xmath10 previously , charge neutrality had been enforced in both phases of a first - order phase transition separately , and a maxwell construct had been used for the mixed phase : @xmath11 ( @xmath12 being the volume fraction of the strange phase ) , where the densities of each phase ( @xmath13 ) were kept constant throughout the phase transition .",
    "this additional constraint lead to an overestimate of the required density for a phase transition to deconfined ( three flavor ) quark matter of up to @xmath14 as opposed to a predicted range of @xmath15 @xcite with the correct treatment of the gibbs condition .",
    "the microscopic stability condition for neutron stars @xmath16 @xcite and the constant densities in both phases also lead to a coexistence region consisting of an infinitely thin spherical shell with a pressure discontinuity , as opposed to a spatially extended mixed phase with continous @xmath17-dependence which follows from the gibbs conditions @xcite .",
    "the driving force for a net exchange of charge between the strange and non - strange phases is the isospin restoring force which leaves the strange phase with a net negative charge .",
    "two phases with opposite charges assume a spatial order which is determined by a minimal sum of the surface , curvature and coulomb energies @xcite .",
    "the predicted geometry of the strange phase has been found @xcite to vary from spheres via rods to platelets immersed in the majority non - strange phase , as density increases .",
    "as soon as @xmath18 , the two phases reverse roles .",
    "the spatial extent of the crystalline phases depends sensitively on the neutron star mass @xcite and properties of matter at supernuclear densities which are not well known , but can reach several @xmath19 .",
    "some of these properties have been investigated in recent works , such as the surface energy between the strange and hadronic phases and the effective mit bag constant in the case of a phase transition to deconfined quark matter @xcite and the surface and curvature energies between normal nuclear matter and a phase with a @xmath2-condensate @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the results were shown to be model - dependent without a definitely reliable result .",
    "the above quoted range of @xmath15 @xcite for the transition density is based upon the bulk approximation for both phases , which neglects any screening effects across the interface .",
    "more recent studies of surface effects , such as a transition layer with a finite thickness of @xmath20 due to debye screening effects and the discontinous pressure due to the surface tension between both phases , however , show a net increase in the bulk energy density of the strange phase in the case of a @xmath2 condensate @xcite , making finite - size droplets for radii smaller than @xmath21 energetically less favorable .",
    "debye screening lengths have been reported for @xmath2 condensed matter ( @xmath22 @xcite ) , for deconfined quark matter ( @xmath23 @xcite ) and for hadronic neutron star matter ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite ) . properly taking into account screening to find the minimum energy configuration ,",
    "see @xcite for @xmath2 condensates and @xcite for deconfined quark matter , effectively opens up another degree of freedom , in itself lowering the energies of both phases , which is favorable for the formation of a lattice .",
    "however , screening can also increase the electron fraction in the hadronic phase by pushing the electrons away from the negative charge on the strange droplet surface , leading to a higher negative charge concentration outside the screened region which will push the pressure at which global charge neutrality can be attained to higher values @xcite .",
    "the screened charges have also been shown to increase the effective surface tension @xmath26 by a coulomb contribution , making droplets with radii smaller than the debye screening length energetically less favorable ( see @xcite for deconfined quark matter ) , thus increasing the required pns density for the first - order phase transition .",
    "a final answer is not possible unless the exact equation of state for hadronic pns matter with and without a @xmath2 condensate and deconfined quark matter with strange quarks is known .",
    "this includes hyperon formation , following which a similar structured phase has not been studied to date .",
    "standard pns models predict central densities in the relevant range of a few times @xmath0 after neutrinos have carried away the bulk of the lepton number in the pns .",
    "a mixed strange / non - strange phase which might form then was shown to have a significant impact on the neutrino transport properties , resulting in a neutrino opacity up to two orders of magnitude higher for typical neutrino energies @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "this opens up a window of observation in supernova neutrino detectors through the remaining lepton number which will be carried away by neutrinos . a pure strange phase which might form for",
    "high enough central densities would have a lower neutrino opacity compared to non - strange pns matter @xcite , effectively creating a transparent strange core surrounded by a relatively opaque coexistence layer .    in the following",
    ", i will refer to a structured mixed layer as phase transition lattice , independent upon the specific spatial ordering and solid or liquid state .",
    "the temperature behavior of the phase transition lattice , including the coexistence curve between a solid , crystalline phase transition lattice and a liquid phase of the droplets containing strangeness is derived in section [ temperature ] .",
    "the mechanical stability of the lattice to shear stresses and its possible breakup is investigated in section [ shearstresses ] .",
    "section [ signatures ] concludes the study and gives an outlook on some possible observational signatures of the formation of the phase transition lattice .",
    "because a solid , crystalline phase might have to be taken into account as a new element in hydrodynamical pns evolution studies and since its neutrino transport properties might be different from a liquid mixed phase , it is important to know the solid - liquid coexistence curve of the phase transition lattice . at the onset of the first - order phase transition and on the outermost layers of the mixed phase in the cold neutron star ,",
    "the volume fraction of the strange phase will be small . in that limit",
    ", the minority phase at zero temperature can be approximated as a coulomb lattice of negative point charges immersed in a slightly positively charged background of normal pns matter .",
    "the absolute charge density in the strange phase will be higher because the majority phase can significantly lower its isospin by pushing negative charge into the minority phase @xcite , more than compensating for the opposing effect of a higher repulsive coulomb energy within the latter .",
    "the reverse is true for the deepest layers of the mixed phase , where the normal pns matter is the minority phase and a high positive charge density resides in that phase , whereas the coulomb interaction is compensated by the condensation energy of hadrons .",
    "the droplet charges given are to be understood as effective values , already taking into account screening effects @xcite . given rigid strange droplets with charge densities large compared to the surrounding hadronic pns matter , the lattice can then be regarded as a one - component plasma ( ocp ) .",
    "its treatment in the harmonic approximation is well - established @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion of the @xmath28-component of the displacement @xmath29 on a lattice site l for a bravais lattice ( defined as having one particle per unit cell ) can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the electrostatic potential and the displacement amplitude @xmath32 is @xmath33 with @xmath34 and the usual definitions for creation- and annihilation operators .",
    "the three characteristic polarization modes , two transverse and one longitudinal , of the bravais lattice are denoted by the index @xmath35 .    in this formalism , the mean square displacement relative to the distance between nearest neighbors @xmath36 for a bcc ( body - centered cubic ) lattice is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the degeneracy parameter and the debye integral is defined as @xmath39 the dispersion relation for the transverse modes has the acoustic debye form @xcite @xmath40 with the debye wavenumber @xmath41 , the plasma frequency @xmath42 and @xmath43 . for the longitudinal branch ,",
    "the einstein model has been suggested with a constant frequency of @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "however , for a cubic lattice in the harmonic approximation , the symmetry condition @xmath45 @xcite makes only one branch necessary to calculate the average square displacement amplitude . for typical lattice constants of @xmath46 , we obtain @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "typical values for the strange ( minority ) phase were used here , a charge density of @xmath49 , a mass density of @xmath50 and a droplet radius of @xmath51 .",
    "the plasma frequency is an important quantity characterizing the lattice , because the degeneracy parameter @xmath52 determines the role quantum effects play and , ultimately , the freeze - out of the ocp . in the present case , for `` typical '' protoneutronstar evolution temperatures , @xmath53 , we get for the degeneracy parameter @xmath54 .",
    "the problem at hand can therefore be treated neither in the zero temperature- ( quantum- ) nor in the classical limit .",
    "the lindemann parameter @xmath55 is defined as the value of the quantity @xmath56 at the solid - liquid transition . for an ocp",
    ", it has been determined using monte carlo - simulations in both the classical ( high temperature ) limit @xcite and in the quantum case ( zero temperature ) @xcite , for both fermions and bosons .",
    "energetically , spin pairing effects on the droplets will drive their total spin to zero .",
    "i therefore treat them as bosons . for the intermediate degeneracies given here",
    ", the interpolation formula for the lindemann parameter of a bosonic ocp by chabrier @xcite is used : @xmath57 with @xmath58 being the quantum limit .",
    "the melting curves for different charge densities on the strange droplets are plotted in figure [ meltingcurve1 ] , where the curves represent charge densities from @xmath59 to @xmath60 in steps of @xmath61 for a mass density of @xmath50 and droplet radii @xmath51 . if the droplets are treated as fermions , the result only differs significantly for coexistence curves with transition temperatures below @xmath62 . it can be seen that an initially liquid phase transition lattice crystallizes for pns temperatures of @xmath63 , which lies well within the range obtained during the kelvin - helmholtz cooling timescales in the standard pns paradigm , for a wide range of parameters ( @xmath12 and @xmath64 ) .",
    "there is , for any given charge density , a lower limit on the droplet radius below which there is no crystallization .",
    "for example for @xmath65 , this limit is between @xmath66 , see figure [ meltingcurve2 ] .",
    "hence , lattices with larger droplet radii solidify earlier in the pns evolution , causing the mixed layer to freeze out from its interior outwards .",
    "the ocp assumes negative , inherently rigid , point charges in a sea of positive background .",
    "however , since the surface tension is only @xmath67 , small compared to strong interaction energy scales @xmath68 for the given droplet dimensions , it is clear that the strange phase droplets can not necessarily be considered as rigid .",
    "it is therefore important to know whether deformation modes have to be taken into consideration in the treatment of lattice vibrations .",
    "consider a droplet of strange matter which is slightly elongated along the x - direction to @xmath69 , yielding an ellipsoid : @xmath70 its surface area is @xmath71 which , when expanded to second order in @xmath72 , yields @xmath73 from which the elastic constant @xmath74 for the deformation energy can be deduced : @xmath75 the inertial term @xmath76 can be found via the kinetic energy @xmath77 ) \\nonumber\\\\ = \\frac{1}{30\\pi } \\rho _ m \\omega_s^2r^5 = \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\frac{4\\pi } { 15 } \\rho _ m r^3 ) \\dot{r}^2 = \\frac{1}{2 } m_s \\dot{r}^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the characteristic vibration energy can therefore be estimated as @xmath78 a typical value , for @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , is @xmath82 , which is comparable to the plasma frequency . _ hence , deformation modes freeze out at about the same temperature as lattice vibrations . _",
    "the ocp can therefore be considered as a valid description of the melting curve of the phase transition lattice , since no other modes are relevant once it becomes a crystal . at temperatures above the transition between a liquid and a solid strange droplet phase",
    ", the lattice- and deformation modes will be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "besides thermodynamic criteria for the existence of a crystalline mixed phase , we need to know whether the lattice can withstand typical shear stresses present in convective pns cores .",
    "the shear constant of a cubic coulomb lattice is @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the lattice energy and @xmath85 the angle of distortion .",
    "the coulomb lattice energy can be calculated using ewald s method @xcite :    @xmath86    where the complementary error function @xmath87 , @xmath88 is a unit cell volume and @xmath89 is a parameter to be adjusted for fast numerical convergence of both real ( vectors @xmath90 ) and inverse ( vectors @xmath91 ) lattice sums .",
    "the result for a bcc - lattice is @xcite @xmath92 @xmath93 being the lattice constant .",
    "the critical shear stress is the force per unit area necessary to maintain two planes of the crystal distorted against each other by an angle corresponding to a displacement of @xmath94 perpendicular to a lattice plane @xcite , which is in the linear approximation @xmath95 which , for a set of typical values , a lattice constant @xmath96 , droplet radius @xmath97 and charge density @xmath98 , gives @xmath99 .",
    "stresses in that order of magnitude might be caused by convection or differential rotation of the newly formed pns .",
    "these stresses can either prevent the formation of the solid lattice in the first place or , if they are due to phenomena which are prone to variations , such as convection , break up a solid lattice formed during a transient period of weak convection .",
    "a negative gradient in the lepton concentration has been shown to lead to convection during the kelvin - helmholtz cooling phase of the pns @xcite .",
    "more recently , hydrodynamics simulations including convection indicate that the ledoux criterion for convective instability @xmath100 is true in most of the pns for times of more than @xmath101 after bounce @xcite .",
    "the pure strange phase in the center of the pns , if it exists , is not expected to show strong negative lepton or entropy gradients .",
    "this is due to the relatively opaque mixed phase enclosing it and the fact that the transport of both heat and lepton number in the pns interior is dominated by neutrinos .",
    "the most violent convection will therefore take place in the matter exterior to the phase transition lattice .",
    "although various authors disagree on the extent and strength of convection in pns s , convective velocities of @xmath102 are reported in many studies @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to a kinetic energy density of @xmath103 , which indicates that convection might indeed be able to either break an existing phase transition lattice or prevent its formation .",
    "a strong enough convective cell forming outside the mixed strange / non - strange layer after its crystallization during a transient quiet period might fracture the solid lattice and mix matter from the non - strange envelope into the now liquid phase transition lattice in the region below the convective cell .",
    "for the duration of the convective flow , this would result in a localized hole with a substantially lowered neutrino opacity @xcite compared to the still intact solid lattice in all other directions , hence in anisotropic neutrino transport through the mixed strange / non - strange layer .",
    "the discovery of a number of millisecond pulsars in recent years @xcite indicates that some of the angular momentum residing in the core collapse supernova might remain in the pns .",
    "the resulting rotation is likely to be differential and has been studied by goussard et al .",
    "@xcite who solved the relativistic stellar structure equations for rotating pns s with representative equations of state for the different epochs in the pns evolution .",
    "the rotation period @xmath104 as a function of radius @xmath105 assumed in that study is ( in the newtonian limit ) @xcite @xmath106 with @xmath107 the characteristic scale of variation of @xmath88 , @xmath108 the distance from the rotation axis and @xmath109 the central rotation period .",
    "the rotation period a pns can acquire without additional accretion has been shown to be limited by the increase of the minimum neutron star mass for times up to @xmath110 post - bounce and by the mass shedding limit beyond that , resulting in @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to velocities of @xmath112 , which is comparable in magnitude to convective velocities sufficient to cause critical shear stresses .",
    "it is not likely that regions of a fast rotating pns at several seconds post - bounce go through a transient phase with low rotation period during which the phase transition lattice could crystallize , possibly to be broken up at later times by a larger gradient in the rotation period . rather , for pns s with rotation periods below @xmath110 , the timescale for the stratification of differential rotation might be of significant importance for the melting curve of the phase transition lattice , possibly comparable to the cooling timescale . however , unless the transport of angular momentum in core collapse supernovae and in particular within the pns is finally resolved , the melting curves presented in sec .",
    "[ meltingcurve ] only apply to pns s with low differential rotation .",
    "the present study shows that if the phase transition from hadronic pns matter to strange matter is of first order and if it results in a lattice of separate strange and non - strange phases in the coexistence zone , it will crystallize for temperatures predicted during the kelvin - helmholtz cooling phase of a pns following a core collapse supernova .",
    "the process of crystallization has , however , complex interactions with the hydrodynamical evolution of the pns .",
    "shear stresses due to strong differential rotation with minimum periods in the range observed for millisecond pulsars and convection induced by lepton gradients might , as long as they persist , prevent the formation of a solid lattice .",
    "a final answer can only be given by the full inclusion of a possibly solid mixed strange / non - strange phase in future core collapse supernova simulations .",
    "if the first - order phase transition occurs before the end of the kelvin - helmholtz cooling phase , the remaining neutrinos to be emitted might serve as a possible window on its formation and crystallization . with the predicted increase in the neutrino opacity for a first order phase transition lattice @xcite , expected",
    "to be especially pronounced for intermediate neutrino energies in the range @xmath113 , the timescale for the decay of the neutrino emission will increase , which might be observable as a knee in the neutrino luminosity .",
    "once the lattice becomes solid , the evolution might be accompanied by fractures and rearrangements in the mixed strange / non - strange zone , possibly showing irregularities in the neutrino luminosity .",
    "if a changing lepton number gradient causes a convective cell to form in a formerly non - convective region located outside a previously crystallized phase transition lattice , sufficiently violent convection might break the solid lattice and locally cause it to return to a liquid state .",
    "non - strange pns matter transported from regions outside the phase transition lattice might mix with the liquid , resulting in an anisotropic neutrino - opaque layer with a partial hole and therefore anisotropic neutrino transport .",
    "this will be more pronounced if the central density of the pns is high enough to allow for a pure strange core enclosed by the relatively opaque mixed zone which essentially dams up neutrinos behind it .",
    "the extent to which the phase transition lattice will affect the neutrino luminosity and emission spectrum will be the topic of a detailed transport study with a special focus on anisotropic neutrino transport in conjunction with a hydrodynamical treatment of the non - strange layers above the coexistence zone @xcite .",
    "this will also include the different neutrino transport properties of a solid versus a liquid lattice .",
