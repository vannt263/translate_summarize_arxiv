    "the determination of the qcd phase diagram , even in the absence of magnetic fields , is still a matter of great theoretical and experimental activities . in this case",
    ", powerful lattice simulations have established that at vanishing baryon chemical potential there is no true phase transition from hadronic matter to a quark gluon - plasma but rather a very rapid raise in the energy density signaling a crossover characterized by a pseudocritical temperature , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the situation is less clear for the finite chemical potential region since , so far , there is no reliable information avaliable from lattice qcd evaluations .",
    "nevertheless , most finite @xmath5 lattice extrapolations for the @xmath6 columbia plot indicate that the critical first order surface ( in the @xmath7 space ) will hit the physical current mass values at some finite @xmath5 thereby characterizing a critical end point ( cp ) @xcite which constitutes the most plausible theoretical scenario .",
    "on the other hand , other lattice evaluations @xcite predict that , as @xmath5 increases , this critical first order surface bends in a way which in principle would exclude the appearance of a cp and the whole @xmath3 plane would then be dominated by a crossover representing an `` exotic '' scenario @xcite .",
    "however , even this situation may be reversed , in favor of a critical end point , if a different physics strongly influences the finite density region causing a back bending of the critical surface @xcite .    at the same time , the possibility that strong magnetic fields may be produced in non central heavy ion collisions @xcite as well as being present in magnetars @xcite , and in the early universe @xcite leads to the question of how these fields influence the qcd phase diagram .",
    "so far , most estimates have been carried out at vanishing chemical potential with the aid of effective theories such as the linear sigma model ( lsm ) @xcite and the nambu  jona - lasinio model ( njl ) @xcite within the mean field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "the general outcome is that the pseudocritical temperature , at which the crossover takes place , increases with increasing values of the magnetic field . some of these applications have also considered these effective models with the inclusion of the polyakov loop to take confinement into account .",
    "the results show that the @xmath8 related to deconfinement also increases with @xmath9 but an interesting splitting between this temperature and the one related to chiral symmetry has been observed @xcite . at @xmath6 , the first lattice attempt to solve the problem considered two quark flavors and high values of pion masses ( @xmath10 ) confirming that @xmath8 should increase with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , an improved lattice simulation @xcite which considered 2 + 1 quark flavors at physical pion mass values ( @xmath11 ) , together with an extrapolation to the continuum , predicted that @xmath8 should decrease with @xmath9 . a decrease of @xmath8 , for the deconfinement transition , has also been observed with the mit bag model @xcite and , more recently , with the large-@xmath12 limit of qcd @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a summary of these results ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is suggested that this behavior is due to the entanglement with the polyakov loop that is affected by magnetic screening as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown , within a simplified framework , that the strong electromagnetic fields can play a catalysing role for a deconfinement transition .",
    "however , as referred in ref .",
    "@xcite , if only the chiral sector is considered , an enhancement of the chiral condensate , due to finite @xmath9 , would not be contradictory with the lattice simulations of ref .",
    "nevertheless , although the quantitative discrepancy remains to be fully understood , there is a concensus regarding the crossover character of the chiral transition at vanishing chemical potential . on the other hand",
    ", the effects of strong magnetic fields at the finite @xmath5 regime has not been fully explored to date even within effective theories .",
    "experimentally , the intermediate temperature regime is important regarding current nuclear collisions at the low - energy end of rhic and in the future with fair at gsi and nica at jinr whose aim is to probe the expected critical point region . at the low temperature end one expects to find a rather interesting physics related to the expected first order phase transition which may have astrophysical consequences ( e.g. , regarding the possibility of quark star formation @xcite ) .    in the chiral limit ,",
    "the two flavor version of the njl model subject to a magnetic field was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite with the mfa while the three flavor version , at the physical point , was recently analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite within the same approximation . in the latter reference , which concerns the more realistic case ,",
    "it was observed that @xmath8 , at @xmath6 , always increases with @xmath9 , as in most model applications . in that work ,",
    "one of the main novelties regards the critical end point location , which moves towards higher temperatures and smaller chemical potential values as @xmath9 increases .",
    "another interesting result concerns the size of the first order segment of the transition line , which becomes longer , as stronger magnetic fields are considered .",
    "also , at low temperatures , it has been observed that the chemical potential value at which the first order transition occurs decreases with @xmath9 . the latter result has been previously observed with the two flavor njl , in the chiral limit @xcite , as well as with a holographic one - flavor model @xcite .",
    "the interested reader may find a model - independent physical explanation for this result , which the authors have termed inverse magnetic catalysis ( imc ) , in ref .",
    "@xcite while a recent review with new analytical results for the njl can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . also ,",
    "very recently , the two flavor njl model has been considered to investigate the dynamics of neutron mesons in a hot and magnetized medium @xcite .",
    "another important application regards the generalized three flavor njl model including eight - quark interactions in which the phenomenon of secondary magnetic catalysis sets in @xcite .",
    "the lsm with two flavors has also been employed to determine the @xmath3 phase diagram with the mfa @xcite and , more recently , with the more powerful functional renormalization group ( frg ) @xcite .",
    "this method has been previously used in an application to the polyakov quark model ( pqm ) demonstrating that , at @xmath6 , the increase of @xmath8 with @xmath9 persists even when mesonic fluctuations are considered @xcite .",
    "the mfa results of ref .",
    "@xcite show that , when all fermionic contributions are considered , the whole @xmath3 plane is dominated by the crossover , irrespective of the magnetic field value while the chiral symmetry broken region expands with @xmath9 .",
    "it is interesting to note here that , in this case , the lsm mimics the `` exotic '' theoretical qcd phase diagram scenario mentioned at the beginning of this section .",
    "however , as we show here , this is just an artifact of the parametrization adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite where the authors chose a rather high value for the sigma meson mass ( @xmath13 ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", the occurrence of a critical point and first order transition depends crucially on the mass of the sigma meson that one uses in the computation @xcite",
    ". apart from the parametrization issue one must be very careful when considering the lsm since different approximations may lead to very different results even at the qualitative level ( e.g. , yielding different types of phase transitions @xcite ) .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that within this effective theory one has scalar and pseudoscalar mesons as well as quarks as degrees of freedom .",
    "also , the pure vacuum contributions may be neglected without spoiling the breaking of chiral symmetry , which happens at the classical level .",
    "this allows for different approaches in which one or more contributions are neglected yielding different results . when magnetic fields are present , the phase diagram obtained with the frg applied to the lsm @xcite agrees , qualitatively , with the ones obtained with the njl in the mfa @xcite .",
    "however , sigma masses of the order @xmath14 have been considered so that one may wonder if the qualitative agreement between the lsm - frg and the njl - mfa predictions for the chiral transition phase diagram are due to the use of smaller @xmath15 values or to the use of a more powerful approximation scheme within the lsm . here ,",
    "in order to address this question , we consider the lsm with the mfa using @xmath16 and also @xmath17 showing that the higher value reproduces the `` exotic '' scenario also found in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "using @xmath17 , we observe the appearance of a first order line starting at @xmath18 and terminating at the critical end point .",
    "however , when magnetic fields are turned on , we do not observe the same qualitative features observed with the njl - mfa and the lsm - frg at intermediate to low values of the temperature .",
    "for instance , at @xmath18 , the coexistence chemical potential values does not decrease with @xmath9 as predicted by the inverse magnetic catalysis mechanism @xcite which points out to the fact that the naive mfa application as performed here , and also in ref .",
    "@xcite , may not be adequate to treat the lsm in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "finally , note that despite all the progress made so far in analyzing the influence of @xmath9 over the @xmath3 phase diagram not much effort has been devoted to investigate particular aspects such as the coexistence and spinodal boundaries associated with the first order transition .",
    "also , the analysis of quantities such as the quark number susceptibility , adiabats , interaction measure , latent heat , etc may help in the understanding of the phase diagram structure under strong magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , the main goal of the present work is to improve over the simple @xmath3 phase diagram by investigating its structure and related physical quantities in more detail .",
    "for instance , to the best of our knowledge , the influence of @xmath9 over the coexistence and the critical regions , for example , has not been addressed before .    in this work",
    "we consider the lsm and the njl model with two flavors in the framework of the mfa in an application which could be viewed as an extension of ref @xcite to the @xmath19 case ( the thermdoynamics of both models , at @xmath1 , has been recently discussed with great detail in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . note that , here , our main focus is on the njl which yields the expected phase diagram scenario , even at the mfa level , allowing us to probe the physically rich first order transition region with its associated critical end point . on the other hand , as already mentioned , the mfa treatment of the lsm at @xmath19 does not generate the expected phase diagram in the full @xmath3 plane by excluding the imc phenomenon for example . here , its investigation is justified for allowing us to trace this problem as being generated by the mfa and not only by a parametrization which considers high @xmath15 values .",
    "these two models , extended by the polyakov loop , have recently been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite where quantities like the magnetic susceptibility of the quark condensate as well as the quark polarization have been evaluate at vanishing temperature .    in the next section we investigate the phase structure of the njl paying special attention to the low temperature regime which has been less explored in the literature . in the same section",
    "we evaluate the effect of @xmath9 over the coexistence and spinodal regions , isentropic lines and the quark susceptibility with the aid of the @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath20 planes . in section 3",
    ", we consider the lsm in the mfa framework , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , but extending the analysis so as to consider the effects of @xmath9 in the sigma meson mass .",
    "we also present the @xmath3 phase diagram for this model , at the physical point , for the magnetic field values relevant to rhic and the lhc .",
    "this exercise will allow us to compare the mfa results furnished by both models .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "at vanishing temperature and finite density the njl model , subject to a magnetic field , has been used to address different questions such as the stability of quark droplets @xcite and the eos of magnetars with and without strangeness in refs . @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the influence of @xmath9 and instantons at the two extreme parts of the phase diagram ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) was studied in ref .",
    "the whole @xmath3 plane was first analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite where only the chiral limit , for the two flavor version , was considered . at the physical point , the same version of the model has been recently considered in ref .",
    "@xcite whose results , for the phase diagram , qualitatively agree with the ones found in ref .",
    "@xcite for three flavors . in this section",
    "we will obtain the eos and then analyze different physical quantities in order to characterize the physical situations which are more sensitive to magnetic effects .",
    "the njl model is described by a lagrangian density for fermionic fields given by  @xcite    @xmath23 , \\label{njl2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 ( a sum over flavors and color degrees of freedom is implicit ) represents a flavor iso - doublet ( @xmath25 type of quarks ) @xmath26-plet quark fields , while @xmath27 are isospin pauli matrices . the lagrangian density ( [ njl2 ] ) is invariant under ( global ) @xmath28 and , when @xmath29 , the theory is also invariant under chiral @xmath30 .    due to the quadratic fermionic interaction ,",
    "the theory is nonrenormalizable in 3 + 1 dimensions ( @xmath31 has dimensions of @xmath32 ) , meaning that divergences appearing at successive perturbative orders can not be all eliminated by a consistent redefinition of the original model parameters ( fields , masses , and couplings ) .",
    "the renormalizability issue arises during the evaluation of momentum integrals associated with loop feynman graphs in a perturbative expansion and , in the process , one usually employs regularization prescriptions ( e.g. dimensional regularization , sharp cut - off , etc ) to formally isolate divergences .",
    "however , the procedure introduces _",
    "arbitrary _ parameters with dimensions of energy that do not appear in the _ original _ lagrangian density . within the njl model a sharp cut off ( @xmath33 )",
    "is preferred and since the model is nonrenormalizable , one has to fix @xmath33 to a value related to the physical spectrum under investigation .",
    "this strategy turns the 3 + 1 njl model into an effective model , where @xmath33 is treated as a parameter .",
    "the phenomenological values of quantities such as the pion mass ( @xmath34 ) , the pion decay constant @xmath35 , and the quark condensate ( @xmath36 ) are used to fix @xmath31 , @xmath33 , and @xmath37 . here , we adopt the values @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 which have also been employed in ref .",

    "fig 2 ( left panel ) displays the spinodal lines , also in the @xmath3 plane , for the same values of the magnetic field showing that very high fields increase significantly the size of the metastable regions . in the @xmath0 plane ,",
    "the coexistence boundary is limited by the two distinct , low ( @xmath83 ) and high ( @xmath84 ) , densities with @xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 at @xmath88 .",
    "the boundaries , for different values of @xmath9 , are shown in fig 2 ( right panel ) where we work in terms of the baryon density , @xmath89 , given in units of the nuclear matter density , @xmath90 .",
    "an interesting feature of this figure is the oscillation of the coexistence boundary around its value at @xmath1 , which is more pronounced in the @xmath84 branch .",
    "the decrease in @xmath84 for @xmath91 , at low temperature , shown in the right panel of fig 2 can be understood in terms of the filling of the landau levels and , with this aim , we present fig 3 ( left panel ) which displays the baryonic density and the effective quark mass as functions of the magnetic field at @xmath18 . to analyze the figure",
    "let us recall that , in the limit @xmath92 , the baryonic density can be written instead of @xmath93 . ] as @xcite    @xmath94    where @xmath95 and @xmath96 or the nearest integer .",

    "now , at @xmath18 , @xmath99 corresponds to the value effective quark mass acquires when @xmath18 and @xmath6 ( the vacuum mass ) which corresponds to @xmath103 at @xmath1 , @xmath104 at @xmath80 , and @xmath105 at @xmath106 . on the other hand , at @xmath18",
    "the first order transition happens when @xmath107 for @xmath1 , @xmath108 for @xmath80 and @xmath109 for @xmath106 so that @xmath110 even at the lowest landau level , as required by @xmath111 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_rho_t0 ] ) . then , to understand the oscillations let us concentrate on the @xmath84 branch which is shown , together with @xmath100 ( the in - medium mass ) , in fig .",
    "3 ( left panel ) where it is clear that both quantities have an opposite oscillatory behavior .",
    "the origin of the oscillations in these quantities can be traced back to the fact that @xmath112 ( the upper landau level filled ) decreases as the magnetic field increases .",
    "the first and second peaks , of the @xmath100 curve , correspond to the change from @xmath113 to @xmath114 for the _ up _ and _ down _ quark , respectively .",
    "as we have seen , for very low temperatures the value of @xmath5 at coexistence decreases with @xmath9 ( see fig 1 ) so that , generally , @xmath112 and @xmath42 must vary and when @xmath112 decreases , @xmath42 increases .",
    "it then follows , from eq .",
    "( [ eq_rho_t0 ] ) , that @xmath115 must decrease . when @xmath114 for both quark flavors there are no further changes in the upper landau level and the low temperature oscillations stop at @xmath116 .",
    "the magnetic field seems to cause a big change on the shape of the coexistence region so that the same high density , @xmath117 , may coexist with distinct low densities , @xmath118 , for two different values of the temperature .",
    "for example , @xmath119 coexists with @xmath120 at @xmath121 and with @xmath122 at @xmath123 .",
    "this pattern is also observed , although in a milder way , at the high value @xmath106 .",
    "our results also suggest that the highest density is achieved at temperatures close to @xmath124 , in opposition to the @xmath1 case where this happens at @xmath18 .",
    "another interesting quantity to be investigated in connection with the density oscillation is the latent heat , @xmath125 , which at @xmath18 is simply given by @xmath126 since the the two coexisting densities occur at the same pressure and chemical potential .",
    "figure 3 ( right panel ) shows that the latent heat value also oscillates around its @xmath1 value for @xmath127 .",
    "figure 4 presents the more intuitive @xmath20 phase diagram showing the region of broken symmetry , which corresponds to the `` gas '' phase , and the region of ( partially ) restored chiral symmetry , which corresponds to the `` liquid '' phase in analogy with a liquid - gas transition .",
    "the figure shows that the transition from the `` gas '' ( csb ) phase to the `` liquid '' ( csr ) phase occurs at lower pressures when @xmath9 increases , as expected .",
    "let us now look at some other thermodynamical quantities , such as interaction measure ( or trace anomaly ) , which is defined by @xmath128    the effect of @xmath9 over this quantity is shown in fig . 5 for @xmath6 ( crossover ) and the critical chemical potential value at @xmath1 , @xmath129 ( first order transition ) .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field enhances sharper transitions .",
    "next , in order to verify how the magnetic field affects the critical region of the phase diagram , let us consider the quark number susceptibility , which is defined as @xmath130 figure 6 shows this quantity , in units of @xmath131 , for @xmath1 and @xmath132 . in both cases",
    "one observes that the critical region set by the contour of @xmath133 has an elongated shape due to the enhancement of this quantity along the first order transition line . as discussed by schaefer and wambach @xcite , at @xmath1 , the reason for this behavior",
    "is that along the path asymptotically parallel to the first order line the quark number susceptibility scales with the exponent @xmath134 which , within the mfa , is expected to be @xmath135 while for any other path the divergence scales with @xmath136 , which in the mfa takes the value @xmath137 .",
    "although we do not perform the explicit evaluation of the associated critical exponents here we can , nevertheless , take this explanation as being valid also at @xmath19 since the shape of the critical region remains elongated along the first order transition line when a strong magnetic field is present as shown by our results .",
    "finally , another interesting physical quantity , that is easily obtained from the eos , is the entropy per baryon number @xmath138 at @xmath1 , the quantity @xmath139 was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to check an eventual convergence of the adiabats toward the critical point as claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite did not observe such an effect and the result was explained by recalling that since there is no change in the degrees of freedom of the two phases one should not expect the focusing effect to arise within the lsm and the njl type of models . in this case",
    "the adiabats show the typical behavior of an ordinary liquid - gas phase transition represented , respectively , by the chirally symmetric and broken phases @xcite .",
    "our results , displayed in fig .",
    "7 , show that the magnetic field does not produce any noticeable effect on the behavior of the adiabats which present a similar pattern at vanishing and high @xmath9 .",
    "in this section , we follow ref .",
    "@xcite and consider the lsm in the approximation where the mesonic sector contributes only at the classical ( tree ) level while one loop quantum corrections , including vacuum contributions , are furnished by the quark sector alone .",
    "we will perform our analysis considering two sets of parameter values , which produce a high and a low value for @xmath15 , in order to address the efficiency of the mfa in dealing with this particular model in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "the lagrangian density of the lsm with quarks reads [ lagsl ] _ lsm = |[i - g(+i_5 ) ] + ( _ ^+ _ ^ ) - u ( , ) , where @xmath24 is the flavor isodoublet spinor representing the quarks , and @xmath140 is the classical potential energy density . in the chiral limit",

    ", an arbitrary mass scale @xmath148 also appears in the final results . as discussed in the introduction , for our purposes",

    "the sigma meson mass falls within the range of the broad resonance @xmath160 @xcite .      treating the bosonic degrees of freedom at the tree level",
    "implies that the loop contributions to the free energy come entirely from the fermionic sector .",

    "( [ vacnjl ] ) , is treated in different fashion within both models and in many lsm applications it is discarded on the grounds that it does not give significant contributions at high temperature and/or chemical potential values . however , a considerable number of studies have pointed out to its importance in the characterization of the phase transition @xcite . here , we follow ref",

    "this procedure gives the following finite result @xmath163 \\ , .\\ ] ]    the expectation values , @xmath164 and @xmath165 fields are obtained by extremizing the free energy @xmath166 while the mesonic masses are determined by the curvature of the free energy at the global minimum @xmath167 evaluated at @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "here , we follow the usual procedure @xcite by setting @xmath170 so that @xmath171 .",
    "let us start by mapping the @xmath3 phase diagram , at the physical point , for three relevant values of the magnetic field ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "let us start with the parameter set which gives @xmath173 whose result is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "8 which indicates that the high-@xmath76/low-@xmath5 behavior is similar to the one found in the njl model .",
    "namely , a crossover happens at @xmath8 values which increase with the magnetic field .",
    "note that , qualitatively , this situation does not change even by going beyond the mfa or employing other parametrizations @xcite . here , the results given by the parametrization leading to @xmath173 start to depart from the ones observed in the njl case at intermediate values of @xmath76 and @xmath5 since the crossover does not change into the expected first order transition with its associated cp .",
    "then , the whole @xmath3 plane is dominated by the crossover exactly as the authors of ref . @xcite",
    "have observed using @xmath13 .",
    "the situation changes drastically if one uses the parameter set which yields @xmath159 as the right panel of fig .",
    "8 suggests .",
    "indeed , with this set one observes the crossover / cp / first order transition pattern .",
    "however , when the magnetic field increases one does not observe the characteristic effects observed earlier in the njl model as the decrease of the coexistence chemical potential at low @xmath76 ( imc ) , the increase of @xmath124 and the decrease of @xmath174 for example .",
    "we can further investigate the strength of the transition by analyzing how the order parameter varies with the temperature as shown in fig . 9 for @xmath6 and @xmath175 . in both cases",
    "one sees that the strength , characterized by the peak of @xmath176 decreases with increasing magnetic fields and the figure also suggests that , when @xmath19 and @xmath177 , the crossover becomes smoother as @xmath9 increases .",
    "based on the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite , which show that a magnetic field makes the transition sharper , one would expect the opposite behavior . since the correlation length is governed by @xmath178 @xcite",
    "the sigma meson mass , as a function of @xmath179 and @xmath5 is also an interesting quantity to be analyzed and with this aim we present fig .",
    "10 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , which considers the pqm at @xmath6 , it has been demonstrated that the value of @xmath15 at @xmath8 is almost independent of @xmath9 ( both , in the mfa and frg approaches ) .",
    "contrary to that , within our approximation , we observe that the difference @xmath180 decreases with increasing @xmath9 which is also in opposition to the expectations furnished by the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . within the njl model the behavior of @xmath181",
    "has also been recently addressed @xcite furnishing results which predict that @xmath180 increases with increasing @xmath9 and also that the transition appears to be sharper as @xmath5 increases .",
    "these comparisons suggest that the naive application of the mfa to the lsm at finite @xmath182 and @xmath9 indeed misses some important physics , especially at finite densities .",
    "this conclusion is not only supported by the njl - mfa results of refs .",
    "@xcite but also by the lsm - frg results obtained by andersen and tranberg @xcite .      in the previous subsection",
    "we have pointed out that the mfa does not seem to furnish reliable results for the lsm . however",
    ", this issue seems to be less severe at @xmath6 where at least the predicted type of transition is in agreement with other model applications as well as with lattice simulations .",
    "we can then address the question of how magnetic catalysis @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an updated review ) affects each model by comparing the dimensionless quantities @xmath183 and @xmath184 where , now , @xmath185 is representing the effective quark mass in each case , that is , @xmath42 in the njl model and @xmath186 in the lsm .",
    "the result , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , suggests that within our approximations the effective quark mass of the lsm is more sensitive to the presence of a magnetic field . at @xmath187 the lsm quark mass",
    "has increased by about @xmath188 while the njl quark mass has increased by about @xmath189 .",
    "the increase of @xmath8 is even more dramatic within the lsm and at @xmath187 it increases by about @xmath190 in relation to the @xmath1 value while in the njl the increase is about @xmath191 . at low values of @xmath9",
    "the lsm pseudocritical temperature suffers a sudden increase which again may be an indication of the failure of the approximations we have adopted for this particular model .",
    "we have considered both , the lsm and the njl model , in the description of hot and dense two flavor quark matter subject to strong magnetic fields , such as the ones expected to be created in non central heavy ion collisions . here , the simplest version of these models , which do not consider the polyakov loop , have been treated within the mfa . in this approximation , one loop fermionic contributions",
    "have been considered , allowing for the determination of the phase diagram associated with chiral symmetry breaking / restoration .",
    "so far , most applications @xcite at finite @xmath182 and @xmath9 have mainly focused in the determination of the @xmath3 phase diagram without analyzing the effects of the magnetic fields over important physical quantities such as the coexistence boundaries , the quark number susceptibilities , the interaction measure and the mesonic masses among others .",
    "therefore , our aim was to perform this analysis in order to understand the effects of @xmath9 in more detail , especially at low temperatures , which is the less explored region .",
    "we have started by considering the njl model , with physical quark masses , obtaining a @xmath3 phase diagram which is in qualitative agreement with the one obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for three quark flavors and also with ref .",
    "@xcite for two quark flavors .",
    "one of the most important features of this diagram is related to the position of the critical end point that appears to be located at higher temperatures and smaller chemical potentials when @xmath9 increases .",
    "one also observes that the first order segment of the transition line increases with @xmath9 while the coexistence chemical potential value decreases at low temperatures .",
    "these observations suggest that the magnetic field has a direct effect in the physics associated with the first order transition and may influence the size and shape of the coexistence region for example . in order to check that we have mapped the @xmath3 plane into the @xmath0 plane showing that for @xmath127 the high density branch of the coexistence phase diagram oscillates around its @xmath1 value as a consequence of filling the landau levels which influences the values of quantities such as the latent heat as we have shown .",
    "this finding may also have consequences regarding , e.g. , the physics of phase conversion whose dynamics requires the knowledge of the eos _ inside _ the coexistence region . for example , at a given temperature , the surface tension between the two coexisting bulk phases ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) depends on the value of their difference @xcite which will , possibly , be affected by the oscillations suffered by the coexistence boundary due to the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "this feature of the phase diagram deserves further investigation since it may be important in the description of the eos inside the boundaries .",
    "then , using the quark number susceptibility , we have mapped the critical region observing that its shape , which is elongated along the first order transition line , is not affected by the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we have also investigated the behavior of the adiabats in the presence of @xmath9 observing the same pattern which was observed at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the two latter results indicate that general model characteristics , associated with the shape of the critical region and the isentropic trajectories , are unaffected by the presence of @xmath9 .",
    "for the njl model we conclude that magnetic fields appear to cause a significant effect at the intermediate and low temperature parts of the phase diagram causing the crossing of the transition lines representing different values of @xmath9 .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields also promotes a change on the size and location of the first order line .",
    "our results for the lsm indicate that the mfa treatment as performed here does not seem to be appropriate , especially at higher values of the chemical potential where , as discussed , the magnetic field has a strong influence . in the light of the results furnished by the more powerful frg @xcite and also those obtained with the njl model within the mfa @xcite",
    "we have observed a significant disagreement , which include the absence of imc in the lsm phase diagram , in the low temperature region .",
