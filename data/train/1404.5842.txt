    "the near - earth asteroid ( nea ) ( 25143 )  itokawa ( 1998sf36 ) is one of the best studied asteroids in our solar system .",
    "it was the sample return target of the japanese hayabusa ( muses - c ) mission .",
    "the spacecraft was in close proximity to the asteroid from september through early december 2005 .",
    "as a result of the encounter , the asteroid has been characterised in great detail : ( 25143 )  itokawa is an irregularly formed body consisting of a loose pile of rubble rather than a solid monolithic asteroid ( @xcite ) .",
    "its appearance is boomerang - shaped and composed of two distinct parts with faceted regions and a concave ring structure in - between ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the detection of yorp spin - up revealed that the two distinct parts of itokawa have different densities and are likely to be two merged asteroids ( @xcite ) .",
    "its effective diameter ( of an equal volume sphere ) is 327.5@xmath15.5 m ( volume of ( 1.840@xmath10.092)@xmath510@xmath6m@xmath7 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this compares very well with the pre - encounter size prediction obtained via radiometric techniques by @xcite ( m05 hereafter ) of d@xmath8=320@xmath130 m .",
    "the radar size prediction is about 16% too high ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mass is estimated as ( 3.58@xmath10.18)@xmath510@xmath9 kg , implying a bulk density of ( 1.95@xmath10.14)g @xmath10 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the retrograde pole orientation in ecliptic coordinates is ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) = ( 128.5@xmath13 , -89.66@xmath13 ) , with a 3.9@xmath13 margin of error ( @xcite ) .",
    "itokawa is classified as an siv - type asteroid via ground - based near - infrared ( nir ) spectroscopy ( @xcite ) , a type common in the inner portion of the asteroid belt .",
    "these measurements at mineralogically diagnostic wavelength show similarities to ordinary chondrites and/or primitive achondrite meteorites .",
    "hayabusa confirmed the s - class asteroid characteristics and revealed an olivine rich mineral assemblage of the surface , similar to ll5 or ll6 chondrites ( @xcite ) .",
    "the most recent geometric albedo estimate of @xmath140.29@xmath10.02 comes from ground - based visual photometry combined with hayabusa - derived size information ( @xcite ) .",
    "the surface is dominated by regions with brecciated rocks and regions with a coarse - grain - filled surface with thermal inertias between that of monolithic rocks ( @xmath15jm@xmath2s@xmath3k@xmath4 ) and powdery surface like lunar regolith ( @xmath16jm@xmath2s@xmath3k@xmath4 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "m05 used a sample of remote , disk - integrated thermal measurements to derive the average thermal inertia of itokawa s top surface layer .",
    "they found a thermal inertia value of roughly 750jm@xmath2s@xmath3k@xmath4 .",
    "a study by @xcite found a very similar value of 700jm@xmath2s@xmath3k@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite combined the thermal inertia value with itokawa s known size and low gravitational acceleration on the surface to determine a mean surface particle radius of 21@xmath17 mm which is in nice agreement with in - situ observations presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one aspect of our work here was to test the derived ( pre - hayabusa ) thermal properties ( mainly the object s thermal inertia ) in the light of the in - situ results .",
    "we re - visit the available remote , disk - integrated thermal data , comprising ground - based observations in standard n- and q - band filters with irtf / mirsi and eso / timmi2 , and from akari , the japanese infrared astronomical satellite ( @xcite ) .",
    "the goal of our study is to describe the possibilities and limitations of radiometric methods when using remote , disk - integrated data , as available or easily obtainable for most of the minor bodies .",
    "the derived values are then directly compared to the in - situ results from the hayabusa - mission . by comparing the results from the radiometric techniques with the in - situ results , we validate model techniques and provide observing strategies for future applications to other targets , including potentially hazardous asteroids ( phas ) .",
    "section  [ cha : obs ] gives an overview of the existing thermal observations and describes the so far unpublished observations by akari . in section",
    "[ cha : tpm ] we describe the different tpm applications and optimisation processes which we applied to the full dataset of remote thermal observations and present the derived results : section  [ sec : tpm ] describes briefly the thermophysical model ( tpm ) and the range of possible input parameters . in a first analysis step we use a spherical shape model with a range of pro- and retrograde spin - vectors ( section  [ sec : sphere ] ) . in the second step ( section  [ sec : trishape ] ) we added the shape and spin - vector information derived from light - curve inversion techniques . in the third step ( section  [ sec : insitu ] ) we used the true shape model and spin - vector solution as provided by the hayabusa mission .",
    "the flux predictions from the best tpm solution are then compared with the available observations . in section  [ cha : predictions ] we inter - compare different shape solutions with respect to thermal light - curves and predict the behaviour of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , the thermal light - curve amplitude , shape , and the thermal beaming effect . in section  [ cha : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the potential and the limitation of the radiometric methods , using the various levels of information .",
    "the summary and transfer of applications to other targets is given in section  [ cha : conclusions ] .",

    "this possible range for the thermal inertia can be translated into a mean grain radius of the surface regolith of about 21@xmath17 mm ( @xcite ) which is in excellent agreement with the in - situ findings ( @xcite ) .",

    "therefore it is needed to add an artificial roughness to account for the thermal beaming effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "this effect occurs mainly at centimetre scales , with small contributions coming from surface porosity on smaller scales ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "multiple scattering of radiation increases the total amount of solar radiation absorbed by the surface and rough surface elements oriented towards the sun become significantly hotter than a flat surface ( @xcite ) . without such a `` beaming model '' on top of the gaskell model it was not possible to find a convincing radiometric solution for all observations simultaneously .",
    "here we used ( as before for the spherical and kaasalainen shape models ) the beaming model concept developed by @xcite , with @xmath33 , the r.m.s .  of the surface slopes and @xmath34 , the fraction of the surface covered by craters .",
    "the beaming model produces a non - isotropic heat radiation , which is noticeable at phase angles close to opposition ( see also figure  [ fig : phase ] ) .",
    "but it also influences the shape of the sed in the mid - ir which is very relevant for our data set ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but more thermal data closer to opposition would be needed to fully characterise surface roughness properties of itokawa .",
    "we combined the gaskell shape model ( accepting the gaskell size scale ) now with our derived thermal properties : an intermediate roughness level ( f=0.7 , @xmath33=0.6 : 70% of the surface covered by craters with a surface slope r.m.s .  of 0.6 ) and a thermal inertia of 700jm@xmath2s@xmath3k@xmath4 . in figure",
    "[ fig : obsmod ] we present the ratios between observed fluxes and the corresponding tpm predictions and show this ratios as a function of phase angle , wavelength , and rotational phase .",
    "these kind of plots are very sensitive to changes in the thermal properties ( a full discussion of the influences is given in @xcite ) : a wrong thermal inertia would lead to slopes in the phase - angle picture ( top in figure  [ fig : obsmod ] ) with large deviations from 1.0 at the largest phase angles , while wrong beaming parameters are dominating at the smallest phase angles close to opposition .",
    "the wavelength picture ( bottom in figure  [ fig : obsmod ] ) gives indications about emissivity variations and is strongly reacting to beaming parameter variations , especially at wavelengths shorter than the peak wavelength .",
    "the observation / tpm ratios also change with different aspect angles and the different sets of measurements are not easy to compare .",
    "our optimum tpm solution seems to combine the available observations without any obvious remaining trend in phase angle , wavelength or rotational phase .     +   +     nevertheless , there are individual outliers where observations and model predictions differ significantly .",
    "some of the data at phase angles above 100@xmath13 ( also visible in figure  [ fig : obsmod ] middle and bottom ) are very problematic in the tpm calculations .",
    "according to @xcite the quality of some of the measurements is poor , but it could also well be that the tpm temperature calculations are not correct and that instead of a 1-d heat conduction a 3-d heat conduction would be required for some of the extreme viewing and illumination geometries ( see also discussions by @xcite ) . the 1-d heat conduction seems to work fine in case of simple shape models , but if a shape model has many small - scale features then the lateral heat conduction might influence the true surface temperatures considerably at least at very large phase angles .",
    "another reason for the offset at large phase angles could be related to the approximate treatment of heat conduction inside the craters ( see section  [ sec : tpm ] ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the rough surface thermal emission is enhanced slightly on the night side because of the mutual self - heating of the interfacing rough surface elements .",
    "this could be another explanation why our tpm predictions are lower than the observed fluxes at high phase angles in fig .",
    "[ fig : obsmod ] ( top ) .",
    "the @xmath28-analysis using the gaskell shape model is almost identical to the analysis using the kaasalainen shape model : we obtained very similar @xmath28-values and also the derived thermal properties agree very well .",

    "there are also severe differences in the peak - to - peak variations from both models ( about 10 - 20% , depending on the wavelength ) , but the deviations vary not only with wavelength , but also with aspect angle .",
    "the minima in the thermal light - curve are also broader than for the visual light - curve .",
    "this is an effect of the object s shape at a given rotation angle combined with the high thermal inertia which smoothes out the rapid changes of illuminated surface areas .",

    "is therefore the recommended approach at the short wavelengths . at 15.0@xmath24 m",
    "the situation is different : the light - curves are in general much smoother and their shapes do not change much with thermal inertia , and the peak thermal emission delay times are smaller than at shorter wavelengths .",
    "these measurements usually lead to more robust size - albedo due to the reduced influence of the roughness - thermal inertia degeneracy ( e.g.@xcite ) . accessing the object s thermal inertia",
    "is more difficult : either one has to measure the thermal light - curve amplitude ( which is substantially decreasing with increasing thermal inertia ) or one has to combine the measurements with observations at different phase angles .",
    "it is also worth to note here that the thermal light - curve shapes , amplitudes , delay times for a given object also depend on the phase angle .",
    "the akari measurements were taken at a phase angle of 73@xmath13 where the illuminated ( hot ) part of the surface dominates the short wavelength observations , while at longer wavelengths there are also flux contributions from the warm , non - illuminated parts which have just rotated out of the sun .",
    "the interpretation of the 30 thermal infrared observations by using only a spherical shape model ( sect .",
    "[ sec : sphere ] ) was very successful : the radiometric effective size prediction lies within a few percent of the true , in - situ value , the radiometric albedo prediction agrees within the error - bars with @xcite , the retrograde sense of rotation was clearly favoured in the optimisation process , and thermal inertia values in the range 500 - 1500jm@xmath2s@xmath3k@xmath4 are the most likely ones .",
    "but the calculations benefited from the proximity of the assumed spin axis orientation with the true orientation and from using a realistic rotation period .",

    "overall , the reduced @xmath28-values are relatively high , indicating that the spherical shape is not always allowing to produce model predictions within the given observational errors . the model predictions for the few cases of extreme cross - sections dominate the overall @xmath28-sums . but here the observations are statistically distributed over rotational phases and aspect angles and the @xmath28-values remain sensitive to basic object properties like thermal inertia and sense of rotation .",
    "if only very few thermal observations would be available , even the distinction between pro- and retrograde solutions could fail for cases where shape effects and/or phase angle effects interfere with thermal signatures in the terminator region .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the capabilities and limitations of the `` radiometric method '' to determine the sense of rotation via very spherical shape models .",
    "based on a sample of 9 main - belt asteroids with comparable sets of thermal observations before and after opposition , the thermal data indicated the correct sense of rotation for 8 objects . in one case it failed , very likely",

    "nevertheless , our extremely simplified model approach shows the large potential of the radiometric technique : assuming a spherical shape in combination with a realistic rotation period and a range of spin - axes it is possible to derive the sense of rotation and very accurate values for the effective size .",

    "the very accurate radiometric diameter prediction has to be seen in comparison with the radar techniques : ( @xcite ) used delay - doppler images of ( 25143 )  itokawa obtained at arecibo and goldstone to predict a size of 594@xmath5320@xmath5288 m ( @xmath110% ) , i.e. , an effective diameter of 379.7 m which is 16% higher than the @xcite value of 327.5 m . in addition",
    ", the radar - technique can only be used if the object has a close encounter with earth , while thermal observations are much easier to obtain .",
    "an important element of the thermal analysis is the reliability of the h- and g - values .",
    "@xcite published new values based on extensive light - curve data from phase angles close to opposition out to 115@xmath13 .",
    "the new h - magnitude differs by 0.5mag from the ones used in m05 .",
    "this influences the albedo considerably ( see discussion in m05 ) while the radiometric diameter is less affected .",
    "the difference in albedo ( 0.19@xmath67 in m05 and 0.299@xmath10.043 from sect .",
    "[ sec : insitu ] ) is mainly caused by this 0.5mag change in absolute magnitude .",
    "@xcite , and later @xcite , applied the tpm technique to thermal observations of the hayabusa2 sample return target ( 162173 )  1999ju@xmath75 .",
    "first , by using a spherical shape model , then by a modified shape model which would match the existing visual light - curves in amplitude and in phase . the quality of the resulting radiometric properties ( diameter , albedo , thermal inertia , ... ) suffered from an unknown spin vector orientation at the time of the calculations .",
    "nevertheless , the example of ( 162173 )  1999ju@xmath75 shows nicely the potential and the limitation of applying this method without knowing the precise shape nor the spin vector orientation .      using the shape model ( together with the spin - vector orientation ) from light - curve inversion techniques",
    "led to a radiometric diameter which was within 2% of the true in - situ result ( m05 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the thermal observations put very strong constraints on the radiometric diameter .",
    "if , in addition , the h - g values are reliable , i.e. , representing light - curve - averaged properties , or if simultaneous v - magnitudes are available , then both , the effective diameter and the albedo can be derived with high accuracy .",
    "alternatively , the size information from radar techniques or occultation measurements can be tested with tpm calculations : is it possible to find realistic thermal properties to explain thermal measurements and the independent size values simultaneously ?",
    "m05 tried such an approach with itokawa s radar size , but they could not find any acceptable match with the observed fluxes and they concluded that the radar size must be too large .",
    "our optimisation process clearly has limitations : figure  [ fig : ito_trishape ] demonstrates that the best solutions from using all 30 data points were strongly affected by a few less reliable observations .",
    "thermal observations suffer in some cases from poor absolute calibration ( or badly documented calibration ) , from high humidity weather conditions and/or high air - masses , or from uncertainties in the definition of band - passes with errors in the colour correction terms .",
    "the plots with observations / model ratios as a function of wavelength , phase angle and rotational phase revealed in many cases the outliers , at least if a high quality shape model ( covering many aspect angles ) is available .",
    "another limiting factor is the uncertainty in surface roughness .",
    "an artificial roughness model is needed to explain typical mid - ir asteroid spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but the precise values or the interpretation of roughness is more complex : the thermal infrared observations are disk - integrated observations , averaging over very diverse surface regions .",
    "the resulting disk - integrated thermal properties , especially the roughness , are therefore of limited significance for characterising individual regions on the surface .",
    "our `` default '' roughness model explains the existing observations very well , although it works in certain observing geometries better than in others , but more observations close to opposition ( see figure  [ fig : tlcamp ] ) or at shorter wavelengths ( e.g.  @xcite or @xcite ) would allow to narrow down the range in the possible roughness parameter space or to even to distinguish between hemispheres or large surface regions with different roughness properties .",
    "it should also be noted here that the roughness influences radiometric size and albedo solutions strongly if thermal infrared observations are only taken close to opposition and/or at short wavelengths in the wien - part of the thermal emission .",
    "overall , the step from spherical to kaasalainen shape model changed only slightly the effective diameter , geometric albedo and thermal inertia values , but the reliability improved significantly : the @xmath28-minima shrank from @xmath225 to about 2 .      the availability of the full , high resolution shape model with spin - vector orientation and absolute size information ( @xcite ) allows to obtain confidence in the radiometric technique : using only the shape model and spin - vector orientation in combination with the set of thermal infrared observations we found the best fit to all data at a thermal inertia of 700jm@xmath2s@xmath3k@xmath4 and under the assumption of a `` default roughness '' .",
    "the corresponding radiometric effective diameter agrees then nicely with the true value .",
    "the radiometric diameter itself has a formal uncertainty of @xmath18% when taking the r.m.s .- residuum from the 25 observations or @xmath761.6% when accepting that the observations represent 25 repeated measurements of the same property , i.e. , the effective diameter of a equal volume sphere .",
    "the radiometrically derived albedo has a r.m.s .- value of @xmath115% or a statistical error of the mean of about @xmath13% .",
    "but in case of the albedo the dominating uncertainty is from the h - magnitude .",
    "the @xmath10.09/0.10mag error in h - value of 19.40mag in combination with the true in - situ size value corresponds to a geometric albedo of 0.29@xmath10.03 , i.e. , @xmath110% .",
    "the influences of uncertainties in the thermal properties and the surface roughness only play a minor role in the final solutions which can be seen in figure  [ fig : ito_trishape ] where the different curves have a very small scatter close to the optimum solutions .",
    "on the other hand , even the high resolution shape models require the addition of roughness on the surface to match the measured fluxes .",
    "these high resolution models include rocks , boulders , craters , valleys and mountains , i.e. , the intermediate scales , but the centimetre scale is missing .",
    "the centrimetre - scale roughness plays an important role , because that is where the energy is reflected , absorbed , emitted , or conducted in the regolith .",
    "images from the hayabusa mission with a spatial resolution of 70 cm per pixel ( e.g. , @xcite ) reveal very diverse surface morphology on intermediate scales ( smooth , rough terrains ) and very likely also on micrometre scale ( solid boulders , smooth terrains , cratered rough terrains ) .",
    "the radiometric technique can be considered as a very reliable ( remote ) technique for the determination of the effective size of small bodies . and the size information is needed not only for potentially hazardous objects , but also to investigate densities , size - frequency distributions , binary / multiple systems , formation process , etc .",
    "the technique only depends on the availability of thermal infrared observations and is not limited to close earth encounters ( like the radar - technique ) or to only the very largest main - belt asteroids ( like the adaptive optics technique ) .    the thermal inertia is an important parameter for small bodies in the solar system , but only known for very few targets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is relevant when calculating the main non - gravitational orbit perturbations over time spans of centuries , caused by the yarkovsky effect .",
    "it is a result of the way the asteroid s rotation affects the surface temperature distribution and therefore the anisotropic thermal re - emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "the thermal inertia might also help to distinguish between solid rock surfaces which are expected to have very high thermal inertias well above 1000jm@xmath2s@xmath3k@xmath4 and regolith - covered bodies , like the moon or large main - belt asteroids .",
    "( 25143 )  itokawa has an intermediate thermal inertia , possibly indicating a rubble pile structure where seismic waves reorganise the body s interior and the surface frequently and the formation of a thick regolith ( with thermal inertias below 100jm@xmath2s@xmath3k@xmath4 ) is hampered .",
    "the reason for having very little fine regolith could also be related to the weak gravity on small , low density objects .",
    "small asteroids tend to have in general higher thermal inertias ( @xcite ) , but there are exceptions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "( 25143 )  itokawa is an extremely important test case for the validation process of thermophysical model techniques .",
    "the existing mid - ir observations allowed to evaluate the possibilities and limitations of different levels of complexity within our tpm implementation . even in cases where very little is known about shape and spin behaviour it allows to derive reliable properties , like the effective size , the albedo and thermal properties without using any artificial model fudge factors .",
    "but the outcome is tightly connected to the availability and quality of thermal infrared observations .",
    "ideally , the observations should ( i ) cover a sufficient wavelength range around the emission peak ( several photometric bands or mid - ir spectra ) ; ( ii ) include measurements before and after opposition ; ( iii ) cover a large phase angle range , including measurements close to opposition ; and , ( iv ) include a significant range of rotational phases and/or substantial parts of the thermal light - curve .",
    "it is also important to note here that some of the mid - ir bands might be affected by silicate emission ( e.g.  @xcite ) , but the effect on size - albedo solutions can only be estimated if full thermal spectra are available .",
    "our analysis showed that for ( 25143 )  itokawa the interpretation of surface roughness properties is limited mainly due to the lack observations close to opposition .",
    "nevertheless , itokawa s size , albedo and thermal inertia have been derived with unprecedented accuracy by only using remote , disk - integrated observations : a shape model from standard light - curve inversion technique and thermal infrared observations from ground and from akari .",
    "the optimum radiometric size agreed within 2% with the true value derived from hayabusa measurements .",
    "the tpm predictions using the true in - situ shape model showed : ( i ) that the shape models from light - curve inversion techniques produce artefacts in thermal light - curves and that low thermal inertia object ( e.g. , large main - belt asteroids ) can have light - curve amplitudes exceeding the pure shape - introduced values ; ( ii ) that the seds taken close to opposition are strongly influenced by properties of the surface roughness ( figure  [ fig : tlcamp ] , top ) leading to a strong degeneracy between roughness and thermal inertia effects ; ( iii ) that there exists a thermal opposition effect and how it looks like ( figure  [ fig : phase ] , top ) , ( iv ) how the thermal light - curve amplitude changes with phase angle ( figure  [ fig : phase ] , bottom ) ; ( v ) that the thermal light - curve amplitudes decrease with wavelength and for higher thermal inertias ( figure  [ fig : tlcamp ] , bottom ) ; ( vi ) that thermal light - curve delay times increase with thermal inertia and decrease for longer wavelengths ( figure  [ fig : akari_tlc ] ) ; ( vii ) that the thermal inertia and the sense of rotation play a big role when interpreting thermal infrared observations at large phase angles .",
    "( viii ) that even the high resolution gaskell shape model still require an additional small - scale roughness to explain the observed infrared fluxes .",
    "our findings are supported by tpm analysis of other spacecraft target asteroids . in this context",
    "one should mention some of the recent studies on ( 4 )  vesta ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , ( 21 )  lutetia ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , ( 433 )  eros ( @xcite ) , and ( 2867 )  steins ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in all these cases",
    "the radiometrically derived properties are remarkably consistent with the spacecraft investigations documented by @xcite for ( 4 )  vesta , by @xcite for ( 21 )  lutetia , by @xcite for ( 433 )  eros , and by @xcite for ( 2867 )  steins .",
    "the tpm radiometric technique is very powerful in deriving highly reliable absolute sizes , albedos , and thermal inertias from remote disk - integrated thermal measurements . but each of the available data points has to be considered in its true illumination and observing geometry . in this way",
    "it is also possible to extract information on the object s spin properties as well as on its shape , especially for objects where standard lightcurve inversion techniques have difficulties to determine these parameters .",
    "the validated model techniques can easily be used for other targets , including near - earth and main - belt asteroids , trans - neptunian objects or inactive cometary nuclei .",
    "the plots and figures can also be used to optimize observing strategies to exploit the full tpm capabilities .",
    "the key ingredient for the full exploitation of thermophysical model techniques and for the determination of reliable object properties is the availability of well - selected and well - calibrated thermal infrared observations covering many aspect angles .",
    "s.  hasegawa was supported by space plasma laboratory , isas , jaxa .",
    "we would like to thank johan lagerros for very useful discussions and robert gaskell for providing the necessary documentation for the implementation of itokawa s shape model .",
