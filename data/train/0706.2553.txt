    "in science , there are a considerable number of problems where fluctuations are present in all scales of length , varying from microscopic to macroscopic wavelengths . for instance",
    ", we can mention the problems of fully developed turbulent fluid flow , the growing of polymer chains , critical phenomena and elementary particle physics .",
    "the problem of non - classical reaction rates ( diffusion limited chemical reactions ) turns out also to be in this category .    as was pointed out by wilson@xcite :  in quantum field theory,elementary `` particles like electrons , photons , protons and neutrons turn out to have composite internal structure on all sizes scales down to zero . at least this is the prediction of quantum field theory '' .",
    "the most largely employed strategy for dealing with problems involving many length scales is the  renormalization - group ( rg ) approach \" .",
    "the rg has been applied to treat the critical behavior of a system undergoing second order phase transition and has been shown to be a powerful method to obtain their critical indexes@xcite .    in an alternative way to the rg approach ,",
    "c.j.thompson@xcite used a heuristic method ( of the dimensions ) as a way to obtain the correlation length critical index ( @xmath7),which governs the critical behavior of system in the neighborhood of its critical point .",
    "starting from landau - ginzburg - wilson hamiltonian or free energy , he got a closed form relation for @xmath8 @xcite , where @xmath9 is the spatial dimension .",
    "it is argued that the critical behavior of that @xmath10-field theory is within the same class of universality as that of the ising model .",
    "one of the present authors@xcite applied thompson s method to study diffusion limited chemical reaction @xmath11 ( inert product ) .",
    "the results obtained in that work@xcite agree with the exact results of peliti@xcite who renormalized term by term given by the interaction diagramms in the perturbation theory .",
    "more recently , nassif and silva@xcite proposed an action to describe diffusion limited chemical reactions belonging to various classes of universality .",
    "this action was treated through thompson s approach and can encompass the cases of reactions like @xmath12 and @xmath13 within the same formalism . just at the upper critical dimensions of @xmath12 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath15 ) reactions , the present authors found universal logarithmic corrections for the mean field behavior .",
    "thompson s renormalisation group method has been applied to obtain the correlation length critical exponent of the random field ising model by aharony , imry and ma@xcite and by one of the present authors@xcite .",
    "his method was also used to evaluate the correlation length critical exponent of the n - vector model@xcite .",
    "yang - lee edge singularity critical exponents@xcite has been also studied by this method . in short",
    "we have been exploring the various possibilities of the thompson s method of dimensions@xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite   @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "as we can see , for instance , by considering these various possibilities of the method , we were able to obtain the universal logarithmic behavior for the coupling parameters of various models at their respective upper critical dimensions [ 4,6,8 - 16 ] .",
    "we also have shown how this method behaves when applied to @xmath16@xcite and we have obtained the logarithmic behavior on scale of energy for coupling @xmath17 ( for @xmath18 ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to describe firstly the qcd - vacuum behavior by considering a strong classical analogy of such a vacuum with a paramagnetic material in the presence of an external magnetic field @xcite . to do that",
    ", we will use in section 3 a simple action in the form of that of landau , i.e.,without temperature and phase transition , where the magnetization due to the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath0 is thought of as a color scalar field of virtual gluons .",
    "such a cloud of virtual gluons are induced in vacuum because , in the investigation of the internal structure of nucleons , high energy scales must be also considered . by applying thompson s method ( t.m ) to such an action , it will be possible to extract an  effective electric permissivity \" @xmath4,an  effective magnetic permeability \" @xmath3 and also an  effective susceptibility \" @xmath1,which depends on logarithmic of energy scale @xmath2 used to investigate the hadronic matter . just in order to obey lorentz invariance , we take in account the simple lorentz condition for vacuum , that is,@xmath5 ( @xmath6)@xcite . our investigation provides an analogy between the energy of the qcd - vacuum and the corresponding energy of magnetic dipoles of a paramagnetic material being ligned up by the action of a magnetic field . due to this fact , in section 2 we will verify that qcd - vacuum at high energies behaves",
    "as if it were predominantly a kind of  color paramagnetism \" for gluons with spin 1,that is , the bosonic behavior of qcd - vacuum in such a  paramagnetic regime ( @xmath3 ) \" for higher energies supplants completely the fermionic contribution for vacuum due to  diamagnetic regime ( @xmath19)\",and thus we will get the asymptotic freedom in qcd as a consequence of this antiscreening effect (  vacuum paramagnetism\")@xcite .    in section 4,we",
    "will study the contribution of quantum fluctuations for the field energy density .",
    "this leads to an interaction energy ( @xmath20 ) as an increment in the field energy and with logarithmic behavior on energy scale , allowing us to obtain a @xmath21 function to be compared with the well - known @xmath21 function of qcd at one loop level .",
    "besides this , in contrast to the asymptotic freedom for high energies governed by those quantum fluctuations , in section 5 we will study quark confinement regime for low energies ( large distances),governed by another new quantum contribution , which leads to an new increment in the field energy , associated with the cofinement energy of quarks . the value of the well - known string constant is computed and it is found to be in agreement with experimental results",
    "quantum chromodynamics  ( qcd)@xcite , the modern theory of the strong interactions@xcite  @xcite is a non - abelian field theory . in 1973,gross and wilczek@xcite and independently politzer@xcite have shown that certain classes of non - abelian fields theories exhibit asymptotic freedom , a necessary condition for a theory that could describe strong interactions .",
    "these seminal papers  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite opened the route to the birth of qcd .    in a not very accurate picture ,",
    "qcd can be considered as an expanded version of qed . in qcd",
    "we have six fermionic fields representing the various quark flavors , in contraposition to a single fermionic field of qed . besides the asymptotic freedom exhibited at the ultraviolet limit",
    ", a theory of the strong interactions must also display quark confinement at the infrared limit .",
    "whereas in qed there is just one kind of charge , qcd has three kinds of charge , labeled by  color \" ( red , green and blue)@xcite .",
    "the color charges are conserved in all physical processes .",
    "there are also photon - like massless particles , called color gluons that respond in appropriate ways to the presence of color charge .",
    "this mechanism has some similarity with the ways that photons respond to electric charge in qed , except the non - abelian character of the theory .",
    "let us write the qcd - lagrangian density , namely :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 , and @xmath25@xcite    in ( 1 ) above , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the mass and quantum field of the quark of @xmath28 ",
    "flavor\",and @xmath29 is the gluon field , being @xmath30 and @xmath7 the space - time indexes .",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are color indexes .",
    "the coefficients @xmath34 ( structure constants ) and @xmath35 guarantee @xmath36 color symmetry .",
    "@xmath37 is the coupling constant .",
    "the gluon part of ( 1 ) contains both a kinetic term , @xmath38 , and an interaction term @xmath39 .",
    "the form of the kinetic term is the same form as the photon term of the well - known qed - lagrangian .",
    "thus exchange of gluons gives rise to forces similar to the coulomb interaction , but acting on particles with color instead of charges .",
    "however , gluons carry color themselves ( unlike photons that do nt carry any charge),leading to the interaction term ( @xmath40 ) between gluons themselves , and this is the situation that makes qcd an asymptotically free theory      it is well - known the energy stored in an electric field according to classical theory , mamely @xmath41 , being the integration performed in a @xmath42 space - like volume . in a previous paper ( see ref . [",
    "17 ] ) , where we have considered @xmath43 at high energies , quantum fluctuations due to vacuum polarization affect the energy through a squared quantum contribution of the field ( @xmath44),since the linear quantum contribution term @xmath45 averages out to zero for long time .",
    "so we have obtained @xmath46  @xcite , where the bars means averaging over a sufficiently long time at the scale of fluctuations .",
    "therefore we were interested in the quantum process , namely the absorption and emission of virtual photons , leading to the quantum correction in the field @xmath47,that is,@xmath48^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ]  @xcite , where the index @xmath49 means root mean square .",
    "we have thought that such a correction is different of zero only in the presence of the fermionic field due to its purely quantum origin .",
    "this led us to propose the relation @xmath50",
    "@xcite , where we have considered @xmath51\\right>_r=\\frac{1}{2\\pi^2 r^3}$ ] ( see 11 in ref . [",
    "@xmath52 corresponds to the mean squared fermionic field on the variable of @xmath53 scale , and @xmath54 is a proportionality constant .",
    "such relations allowed us to obtain @xmath55 in qed for quantum contribution of the field@xcite  @xcite  @xcite at high energy .",
    "it must be compared with the inverse square gauss law of the classical contribution , and so we perceive that it leads to a logarithmic correction on @xmath53 scale for energy of the field@xcite  @xcite .",
    "as qcd introduces color charges and color fields since gluons carry color charges ( unlike photons that do nt carry any charge)@xcite , we could extend the reasoning above in order to treat qcd by considering a general  color electric field\",namely :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the classical contribution for the color field with a  mode \" @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath58 is a fermionic contribution for the color field , which is similar to that of qed ( @xmath59^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ]  @xcite),however qed has no color .",
    "@xmath60 is a quantum contribution for the color field , which does not have any analogy with qed .",
    "such a contribution is due to quantum fluctuations of color fields in the presence of bosons ( gluons ) since they carry color themselves , that is , it is a bosonic contribution for the color field .",
    "we will see that such a new quantum contribution comes exclusively from qcd - vacuum behavior , which leads to the antiscreening effect and thus makes qcd an asymptotically free theory    actually , relation ( 2 ) supplies a total energy density @xmath61,being @xmath62 the classical contribution for energy density,@xmath63 and @xmath64 the fermionic and bosonic contributions respectively .",
    "we will see that @xmath64 has a changed signal with respect to @xmath63,which leads to the antiscreening effect and the asymptotic freedom in qcd , in opposition to the screening effect of qed .",
    "now we assume that a heuristic approach used by thompson@xcite to study critical phenomena can be applied to the lagrangian ( 1 ) .",
    "the first prescription of thompson@xcite  @xcite is basically a scale argument with dimensional analysis for average values on scales .",
    "it states that :     when we consider the integral of the lagrangian ( 1 ) in a coherence volume @xmath65 for d - dimensions , the modulus of each integrated term of it is separately of the order of unity \" .",
    "this method by using its three prescriptions was firstly applied by thompson@xcite to the landau - ginzburg - wilson free energy or hamiltonian , obtaining critical exponents within the same universality class of the ising model . as the present model does not have any kind of phase transistion or spontaneous breakdown of symmetry , it is only necessary to use the first prescription of thompson .",
    "so by applying such a prescription to the knetic fermionic term of lagrangian ( 1),we write    @xmath66_r dv_4\\right|\\sim 1,\\ ] ]    where @xmath67    we can observe that the dimension of '  @xmath68 `  ( @xmath69_r$ ] ) which appears in the integral ( 3 ) is the same as @xmath70_r = r^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this is because we are thinking only about a dimensional analysis in ( 3 ) for '  @xmath68 `  .",
    "so for such a case we can naturally neglect the spinorial aspect of the field and just consider the '  first derivative @xmath71 `  , which defines the fermions ( quarks ) regarding to the scaling dimensional analysis , that is,@xmath70_r = r^{-1}$ ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that the integral above leads immediately to a kind of scaling dimensional analysis , where the dimensional value of certain quantity @xmath72 $ ] inside the integral is taken out of its integrand as a mean value in a coherent hyper - volume of scale @xmath73,being @xmath67 .",
    "thus from ( 3 ) we extract the following scaling behavior , namely :    @xmath74\\right>_r \\equiv [ \\overline{\\psi_j}\\psi_j]_r\\sim\\frac{1}{r^3}\\ ] ]    in analogous way to that heuristic reasoning used for qed , by considering the fermionic contribution of condensate @xmath75 over quantum fluctuations of field @xmath47,namely @xmath76\\right>_r\\propto\\frac{1}{r^3}$ ]  @xcite , for qcd we have a fermionic contribution for quark condensate , which also contributes for quantum fluctuations of the color field @xmath77 through @xmath78,namely :    @xmath79\\right>_r\\propto\\frac{1}{r^3}\\ ] ]      let us firstly recapitulate some properties of ordinary polarizable media for classical theory",
    ". in a polarizable medium , the potential energy of two static test charges @xmath80 and @xmath81 is @xmath82,where @xmath53 is the distance between the two charges , being @xmath83 the dieletric constant , which in vacuo takes the value @xmath84 .",
    "ordinarily , the polarizability of the medium causes a screening of the interaction between the test static charges , meaning that @xmath85 . on the other hand",
    ", antiscreening corresponds to @xmath4 .",
    "a relativistic quantum field theory has a vacuum which presents a strong classical analogy with the ordinary polarizable medium , however it just differs from an ordinary polarizable medium on a very important aspect : it is relativistically invariant .",
    "this means that , if we set the velocity of light @xmath86,the magnetic permeability @xmath30 is related to the dieletric constant ( electric permissivity ) @xmath83 by    @xmath87    the implication of lorentz invariance in qcd is very important for theories about confinement of quarks and gluons@xcite .",
    "such a relationship ( 6 ) does not exist for an ordinary or classical polarizable medium .    in order to obey lorentz invariance given in (",
    "6),we can conclude that ordinary screening means @xmath19 ( diamagnetism ) and ordinary antiscreening means @xmath3 ( analogous to paramagnetism of the landau s classical theory ) .",
    "the magnetic permeability @xmath30 is written in the following way : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "qcd - vacuum has classical analogy to the paramagnetic medium@xcite .",
    "we will see that the increasing of energy scale @xmath2 to investigate hadronic matter leads to increasing of  effective susceptibility \" of qcd - vacuum @xmath90 to be determined in the next section .",
    "this leads to an increasing of the  effective magnetic permeability \" of qcd - vacuum , namely @xmath91 .    by considering a paramagnetic medium with a volume @xmath92 and an uniform magnetization @xmath93 in the presence of the field @xmath0,thus we have the following energy :    @xmath94    where @xmath95 .    in spite of",
    "there is not lorentz invariance in ordinary media , a paramagnetic medium still realizes a strong classical analogy to qcd - vacuum in the sense that we could think that such a vacuum is a medium with spin effect of color charges@xcite related to virtual gluons with bosonic spin ( @xmath96 ) like photons . so in this case , we have a direct classical analogy to magnetization @xmath93 due to fermions ( @xmath97),which leads us to think about a kind of  color magnetization @xmath98 \" for qcd - vacuum as being a  color paramagnetic medium \" in the presence of a  color magnetic field @xmath99 \" .",
    "following such an analogy to qcd - vacuum , we can write    @xmath100    where @xmath31 is just a color mode that we select for convenience , being @xmath101 the  effective paramagnetic susceptibility \" for qcd - vacuum , having dependence on the energy scale @xmath2 .    in ( 8),paramagnetism manifests itself through the minus sign in front of the right - hand side .",
    "this has an analogy to qcd , where the vacuum energy is decreased in the presence of a color magnetic field@xcite .",
    "so ( 8) can be written in the following way for representation of the  color paramagnetic energy \" of qcd - vacuum , namely :    @xmath102    where @xmath92 is a kind of coherence volume inside which the color fields are greatly correlated , in analogy to correlated spin effect@xcite .",
    "the behavior of the increasing function @xmath101 will be shown in the next section .",
    "the interesting classical analogy between qcd - vacuum at a certain energy scale @xmath2 of investigation and a paramagnetic medium with magnetization @xmath93 in a magnetic field @xmath0 motivates us to introduce an effective landau s hamiltonian for representation of vacuum inside the hadronic matter as a paramagnetic medium in the presence of a color magnetic field @xmath99 .",
    "this simple model will be presented in this section .",
    "it is well - known that a cloud of virtual gluons emerges in qcd - vacuum at high energies @xmath2,leading to the  color paramagnetism \" ( antiscreening),whereas on the other hand , a cloud of virtual electron - positron pairs appears in qed - vacuum at high energies , leading to vacuum polarization .",
    "we have a  dielectric vacuum \" ( screening ) for qed .",
    "the cloud of virtual gluons in qcd - vacuum are quanta of color field induced by the probe used to investigate the structure of the hadronic matter , which depends on its energy scale @xmath2 .",
    "it depends also on the proper color magnetic field @xmath99 that already exists inside the hadronic matter under investigation .",
    "therefore , such a color field could be thought of as being directly related to the color magnetization @xmath98 and also to the color magnetic field @xmath99 , since we have the relation @xmath103 .",
    "so now let us think about such a color field as being a general scalar field @xmath104,namely :    @xmath105=\\phi_a[\\chi(u),h_a(r)],\\ ] ]    where @xmath106 . as the effective susceptibility @xmath101 and the color magnetic field @xmath99",
    "are independent parameters , let us use for convenience the scalar color field @xmath107 in the form @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "here we think that the color magnetic field @xmath99 and color magnetization @xmath98 have dependence on @xmath53-coordinate inside the  color paramagnetic medium \" represented by the hadronic matter .",
    "due to the classical analogy to paramagnetism , let us introduce now the following  effective landau hamiltonian \" for  color paramagnetism\",namely :    @xmath109d^dr,\\ ] ]    where , in this case , the coefficients @xmath110 and @xmath111 do not depend on temperature since there is no phase transition in such an effective model .",
    "the integration ( 12 ) extends over @xmath9-dimensional volume .",
    "thompson s approach has three assumptions ( see ref.[3 ] ) .",
    "as we are not interested in phase transition , we use only the two first ones , namely :    \\(a ) when the integral in ( 12 ) is taken over the coherence volume @xmath65 in @xmath9-dimensions , the three terms separately in ( 12 ) are all of order unity .",
    "\\(b ) in the specific case of ( 12),we just have to consider the parameter @xmath111 to be finite in the limit @xmath112 .",
    "this leads us to consider a mean field regime above a certain critical dimension @xmath113,where the coefficient @xmath114 remains contant . in landau s theory , we have @xmath14  ( ref.[3 ] ) .    by applying the assumption ( a ) in the first term of ( 12),we",
    "write    @xmath115    where the parameter @xmath116 forms the basis of our dimensional argument and may be thought of as a wavelength cut - off , so that the mean value @xmath117 behaves as    @xmath118    for the second term in ( 12 ) we have    @xmath119    by introducing ( 14 ) into ( 15),we obtain    @xmath120    for the third term in ( 12),we have    @xmath121    such that from ( 14 ) and assumption ( b),from ( 17 ) we obtain    @xmath122    from ( 18),we observe that @xmath18 is a special dimension ( an upper critical dimension ) above which we have a mean field behavior@xcite , that is to say , the coupling parameter @xmath114 does not depend on scale @xmath116,being a constant parameter . in other words , below @xmath18,fluctuations are very important for the problem , deviating from mean field behavior , and above @xmath18,mean field \" description@xcite is a good description for the problem .",
    "so @xmath18 , which coincides with the space - time dimensions , corresponds exactly to a kind of border - line dimension to represent qcd - vacuum as a lorentz invariant theory and also its classical analogy with paramagnetic media .",
    "therefore , we must improve our approximations in order to  see \" the logarithmic dependence on scale @xmath116 ( ref.[17 ] ) of the coupling @xmath111 just at @xmath123,or equivalently at the energy scale @xmath124 .",
    "similar situation has also occurred when we treated diffusion limited chemical reactions through thompson s",
    "approach@xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite , displaying universal logarithmic behavior on  upper critical dimensions \" for  coupling constants \" of those different models .",
    "following that improvement technique to  see \" such a logarithmic behavior , let us improve the calculation of ( 17 ) by taking the quantity @xmath125 inside the integral ( 17 ) and starting from the same scale form as that evaluated in ( 14),but now displaying a dependence on @xmath53-variable of scale .",
    "so by taking inside the integral ( 17 ) the quantity @xmath126_r^4=([\\phi_a]_r^2)^2= r^{4 - 2d}$ ] and also the @xmath9-dimensional volume of integration in the form @xmath127,we have    @xmath128    where just for @xmath18,that is exactly on the boder - line of mean field regime , where @xmath114 is practically constant , we are able to see now the refinement of the logarithmic dependence at length scale for @xmath114,namely @xmath129 , which implies @xmath130^{-1}$ ] .",
    "so now , if we perform such a integration between the limits of scales @xmath116 and @xmath131,by considering here @xmath131 an upper cut - off of length , we write    @xmath132    from where we obtain    @xmath133    where the energy scales are @xmath134 and @xmath135,being @xmath136,since @xmath137 is a lower cut - off in the scale of energy , i.e.,it is a infrared limit .",
    "as we have obtained the logarithmic behavior of the coupling parameter @xmath114 just at @xmath123 for such a paramagnetic medium , we can make an analogy with @xmath138-vacuum by obtaining now the  color scalar field amplitude \" @xmath139 , having a direct analogy to the equilibrium magnetization of the landau picture , namely @xmath140  ( ref.[3 ] ) .",
    "however , since we do not have any spontaneous breakdown of symmetry , we just consider simply the coefficient @xmath141 instead of @xmath142  ( ref.[3 ] ) .",
    "thus we obtain    @xmath143    as we are interested only in the behavior of @xmath139 on the border - line at @xmath123,associated with the space - time , we introduce ( 21 ) into ( 22 ) and so we have    @xmath144    where @xmath145 is a positive proportionality constant .",
    "we can associate the amplitude of scalar field @xmath146 with a negative energy density @xmath147 of a  color paramagnetic medium \" ( @xmath138-vacuum),having analogy to that negative energy density of a paramagnetic medium , namely @xmath148 ( ref.[18 ] ) .",
    "however , we must consider an ",
    "effective susceptibility \" @xmath101 to represent qcd - vacuum , and also consider a  color magnetic field \" @xmath149 .",
    "so such an analogy leads us to write    @xmath150    from where we can firstly extract @xmath151 and @xmath152,and so we can rewrite ( 24 ) as follows :    @xmath153    by comparing the right side of ( 25 ) with the right side of ( 24),we can also extract the  effective susceptibility \" , as follows :    @xmath154    from ( 26),it is interesting to observe that the effective susceptibility of @xmath138-vacuum increases logarithmicaly with energy scale @xmath2 . from ( 21 ) and ( 26),we can also note that the parameter @xmath114 is @xmath155,which allows us to interpret such a parameter as being related to a  strength \" of coupling @xmath156 between quarks .",
    "so we have @xmath157 .",
    "that is because , when @xmath158 in infrared limit , this implies @xmath159 ( very weak ",
    "paramagnetism\"),which leads to @xmath160 ( a much more strong coupling),that is , we have a highly confined regime of quarks for low energies . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath161 for ultraviolet regime , this implies @xmath162 (  color paramagnetism \" becomes much more evident),which leads to @xmath163 ( a very weak coupling between quarks ) , that is to say , we have the well - known asymptotic freedom for high energies .",
    "for sake of simplicity , if we take the color magnetic field @xmath99 practically uniform in ( 25),that is also to say , an uniform energy density @xmath164 or @xmath139,and by considering a coherence volume @xmath92,we simply obtain thecolor paramagnetic energy \" @xmath47 as that given in ( 10),being @xmath165 given now in ( 26 ) .",
    "so we finally write    @xmath166    the  effective magnetic permeability \" @xmath167 can be obtained by considering ( 26),namely :    @xmath168    in order to obtain the  effective electric permissivity \" or the dieletric constant @xmath169 of qcd - vacuum , now we must guarantee the lorentz invariance by considering the relation ( 6 ) ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "so doing that and considering ( 28),we find    @xmath170    being @xmath171 .",
    "we have @xmath172 for @xmath173 .    in qcd",
    ", we have an antiscreening , such that the effective interaction between strong charges for higher energies is @xmath174,with @xmath4,that is,@xmath175 . as the strong interaction is directly related to the strong coupling @xmath156,we",
    "can also write it in the form @xmath176 .",
    "so by considering ( 29),finally we can also write it as follows :    @xmath177    where we fix @xmath178 to be a large value , but finite for low energies .",
    "so ( 30 ) reveals to us the asymptotic freedom behavior for @xmath138 at high energies because , if we fix @xmath137 and consider @xmath161,the ratio @xmath179,which means that the strong coupling decreases when the energy scale increases .",
    "however , actually only the bosonic contribution of gluons for qcd - vacuum was evaluated for dieletric constant . in reality , there is a competition between the effects of bosonic ( antiscreening ) and fermionic ( screening ) contributions , where the first one prevails .",
    "this subject will be treated in the next section .",
    "quantum fluctuations lead to an interaction energy ( @xmath20 ) as an increment in the field energy and with logarithmic behavior on length or energy scale .",
    "we can represent both of fermionic and bosonic contributions of energy density @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( see ( 2 ) ) in the following conpact form :    @xmath180    where @xmath62 represents the classical energy density .",
    "@xmath181 is the total contribution of quantum fluctuations for energy density , such that there is certain superior cut - off wavelength @xmath182,below which ( @xmath183 ) we have quantum behavior of energy density @xmath181 on @xmath53 scale , that is,@xmath184 , and equal or above which ( @xmath185 ) we recover the well - known classical behavior of @xmath181,namely @xmath186 . to be more accurate ,",
    "we rewrite a general form of @xmath181 for two regimes , namely :    @xmath187    where @xmath188 is a sharp cut - off wavelength . as the quantum regime also presents the bosonic contributions @xmath189,which leads to antiscreening in qcd , the mass @xmath190 must be considered as a dynamical variable which exhibits fluctuations depending on the energy scale .",
    "we are interested only in quantum regime for energy density @xmath191 of the field ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "so we want to obtain the interaction energy @xmath193 in a certain coherence volume @xmath92 .",
    "then let us think about a spherical volume @xmath92 and therefore we have the interaction energy in the differential form , namely :    @xmath194    we also can write ( 33 ) in the following way :    @xmath195    where we have considered the energy scale @xmath2,such that @xmath196,being @xmath197 .",
    "so by performing the integration of ( 34),we write    @xmath198    where @xmath199,and @xmath136 .",
    "due to fluctuations , it is natural to think that the coupling @xmath200 and the mass @xmath201 vary rapidly with the energy scale @xmath2,so that we must take them off the integral ( 35 ) as avarage values on scale @xmath2,namely :    @xmath202    where we define @xmath203 .",
    "on the other hand , it is important to perceive that the increment on mass @xmath204 due to interactions in such a quantum regime is directly proportional to the increment on the coupling ( @xmath205 ) , since both of the increments present logarithmic behavior on scale .",
    "such a reasoning was used before for @xmath43 ( see ref.[17]),and so now extending it to our problem , let us write    @xmath206    by introducing ( 36 ) for @xmath207 into ( 37 ) and by performing the calculations , we obtain    @xmath208    being @xmath209 .",
    "now let us write @xmath210 in the following way : @xmath211 where @xmath212 is a certain reference coupling to be duly interpreted .",
    "the equations ( 36),(37 ) and ( 39 ) define the variable parameters @xmath213,@xmath214 and @xmath212 . only the parameters @xmath200,@xmath201,@xmath205 and @xmath207 are always real quantities , since they are physical parameters .    by substituting ( 39 )",
    "in ( 38),we obtain @xmath215    from the general result ( 40),we can observe that the sign of @xmath212 can change by controlling the predominance of antiscreening or screening . in the case of @xmath216,then we have @xmath217",
    "for @xmath161,which leads to the asymptotic freedom behavior of qcd connected to antiscreening . on the other hand , if @xmath218,we have the well - known landau singularity@xcite , namely a finite value of the energy scale @xmath219,such that @xmath220@xcite . for illuminating ideas about the landau pole ,",
    "see refs.@xcite  @xcite .",
    "this is the case of the increasing of the coupling with the increasing of the energy scale , associated with screening for qed .",
    "such opposite case ( @xmath218 ) leads to an imaginary value for @xmath213 ( see ( 39)),which means a non - asymptotically free theory .",
    "the result ( 40 ) also implies the following differential equation :    @xmath221    that is , by performing the integration of ( 41 ) above in the limits @xmath137 and @xmath2 and their respective couplings @xmath222 and @xmath223,we obtain ( 40 ) .",
    "this result ( eq . ( 41 ) ) must be compared with the well - known @xmath224-function for qcd@xcite  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite when evaluated at one loop level , namely :    @xmath225_{qcd}=-(\\frac{33 - 2n_f}{3\\pi})\\alpha_s^2\\ ] ]    it would be worth to make some comparison of the results of the equation ( 41 ) or ( 40 ) with some experimental evaluation of the strong coupling as a function of momentum ( energy ) of the probe . in a plot of reference",
    "[ 20 ] , it is possible to get an estimate for @xmath226,namely :    @xmath227    taking in account ( 43 ) and by comparing ( 41 ) with ( 42),we have    @xmath228    for obtaining @xmath212 in ( 44 ) we also have considered @xmath229 as the number of quark flavors . by using eq.(40 ) and the fact that @xmath230 , then @xmath231 can be determined .",
    "so taking in account the previous results , we get    @xmath232    this value is practically the quark constituent mass of the nucleon if we consider that each valence quark carries out one third of the nucleon mass .",
    "in contrast to the asymptotic freedom , which governs the ultraviolet ( short distances ) behavior of the theory , we also intend to look for its infrared behavior .",
    "we propose that such achievement can be considered taking in account the role of a scalar field in addition to the other quantum contributions for the energy density . whereas @xmath233 and @xmath234 behaves as @xmath235,we have @xmath236 .",
    "so we write the total field energy density as follows :      where @xmath238 is supplied by the scale relation ( 14 ) for @xmath18,namely @xmath239 . for very large distances ( much lower energies )",
    ", @xmath238 prevails whereas the terms @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 go rapidly to zero . that is the reason why that last term in ( 46 ) governs quark confinement .                            since there are 3 quarks inside the nucleon , having each one the constituent mass @xmath256,and also 3 pairs of linked quarks@xcite , so the confinement mean energy per quark pair @xmath257 leads us to consider from ( 51 ) that        we can estimate the value of @xmath260 .",
    "taking in account ( 43 ) and ( 44),we can calculate @xmath261 from ( 40),and so we obtain @xmath262 .",
    "we also obtain @xmath263,where we have considered that each valence quark with constituent mass @xmath250 carries out one third of the nucleon mass . finally , we estimate @xmath264 gev / fm .",
    "this result is in agreement with experiments as can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "we must emphasize here that the non - perturbative treatment for infrared regime in qcd is generally based on lattice gauge theory@xcite , leading to numerical approaches .",
    "therefore , quark confinement can not be treated analytically by perturbative methods . in view of this fact",
