    "for example , if in a cubic sample representing a realistic porous medium with porosity @xmath166 we add chambers with lengths 5% of the sample length , we obtain a computational domain with porosity @xmath167 .",
    "even more dramatically is the case if the sample has a smaller porosity .",
    "if we add chambers with the same length explained above to a cubic sample with porosity @xmath168 , the total porosity would increase by a factor of @xmath169 .",
    "since the efficiency of both @xmath0-implementations scales linearly with the porosity , the use of chambers is expensive in terms of computational cost and should be avoided if possible . for low porosity values , as realistic samples have , the pore - list implementation is more efficient than pore - matrix . on the other hand , for more open domains , as pipes for example ,",
    "the pore - matrix data structure is more efficient since it does not require the connection matrix .",
    "a quantitative comparison of the computation efficiency is not easily possible . even though it is possible to calculate for both implementations the number of floating - point operations necessary to perform a single time step ,",
    "a quantitative analysis of the performance of two idependent codes is not as straightforward : the code performance strongly depends on the actual implementation details , memory access patterns and in particular also on the cache performance of the used architecture .",
    "we presented different alternative setups to estimate the permeability of a porous medium , which utilize an injection channel ( @xmath3 ) , pressure boundary conditions ( @xmath4 ) , or a force density applied in the sample volume ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the setups differ on how the fluid is driven and how the pressure gradient is being estimated .",
    "further , the accuracy of the @xmath1and @xmath2  method together with different setups with variable chamber length , has been investigated .",
    "another point that has been stressed is the efficiency of the @xmath0-implementations comparing the standard implementation using a pore - matrix data structure with a pore - list code to represent the geometry .",
    "our findings show that the use of @xmath5  as an alternative for permeability estimation should not be taken into account due to the need of chambers as fluid reservoir together with the strong dependency of the results on the length of these chambers .",
    "this is an important result since driving the fluid by using a body force applied in the sample volume is probably the most popular approach in the literature on permeability calculations using the @xmath0method .",
    "further , the pore - list implementation allows to reduce the computational effort required to simulate fluid flows in porous media substantially if the porosity of the porous medium is small .    finally , taking into account the extra computational effort added because of the number of required lattice nodes when chambers are used ,",
    "it is highly recommended to completely eliminate them by using @xmath4 .",
    "a resulting compromise in the accuracy can be resolved by using the @xmath2  method .",
    "for this reason in the case of facing the permeability estimation of a realistic media , pore - list , @xmath4 , and @xmath2  is the combination suggested by the authors taking into account the computational domain size , accuracy and required computer time .",
