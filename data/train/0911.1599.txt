    "recently , the author has derived the following formula for the @xmath3-temperature in superfluid helium-4  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the density of liquid helium-4 at zero temperature , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the mass and the hard sphere diameter of a helium atom , respectively . thus , @xmath3-temperature is determined only by the _ three _ physical parameters , @xmath8 and @xmath7 . among these parameters ,",
    "the hard sphere diameter @xmath7 is especially important , because it is a crucial parameter for hard - core repulsive interactions at short distances . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) , one can obtain the theoretical value of @xmath9 , because the experimental values of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are known .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) gives @xmath10 k  @xcite , which is very close to the experimental value of 2.1768 k  @xcite .",
    "the deviation between the theoretical and experimental values is less than 1@xmath11 . in this",
    "meaning , our approach succeeded .",
    "however , in the previous paper  @xcite , we did not study the elementary excitations .",
    "although the roton , which is an elementary excitation with finite energy gap @xmath12 , has been extensively studied in the past , its physical nature still remains unclear  @xcite . in this paper , we calculate the roton energy gap at zero temperature @xmath0 to understand the physical nature of roton .",
    "first , we calculate the roton energy gap using the effective potential of the mean field effective field theory .",
    "second , we introduce the curvature matrix which allows us to calculate the energy gap directly .",
    "the relation that we have derived is very simple , @xmath13 .",
    "this relation gives @xmath14 k , which is very close to the experimental value of 8.712 k. finally , we comment on an open problem about the sound speed of phonon . in the next section ,",
    "we begin with a brief review of ref .",
    "@xcite for self - consistency of this paper .",
    "the superfluid phase of liquid helium-4 is described by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) effective field theory , in which the cooperative state of many interacting helium atoms is represented with a single complex scalar field @xmath15 .",
    "gp theory is defined by @xmath16 where @xmath15 is a one - component complex scalar field with both amplitude and phase , @xmath6 is the mass of a helium atom , @xmath17 is the chemical potential , @xmath18 is the coupling constant for hard - core repulsive interactions at short distances and @xmath7 is the hard sphere diameter of a helium atom , respectively .",
    "thus , gp theory is a nonrelativistic version of the goldstone model in particle physics . gp lagrangian  ( [ eq : gp ] ) is invariant under the _ global _ @xmath19 transformations ; @xmath20 , @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "because @xmath19 symmetry is not gauged , no vector gauge field appears .    in the gp theory ,",
    "the @xmath3-transition is described as the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the @xmath19 symmetry .",
    "one can understand this statement as follows .",
    "the effective potential @xmath23 at the tree - level approximation is given by the third and the fourth terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gp ] ) , which does not contain the derivatives ; @xmath24 as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath3-temperature @xmath9 is determined only by this potential . here",
    "it should be noted that the chemical potential @xmath17 becomes _ positive _ below the @xmath3-temperature  @xcite , and then the ground states become degenerate for @xmath25 .",
    "[ fig : transition ] shows the schematic temperature dependence of the effective potential @xmath23 .",
    "let s consider the ground state of this system below the @xmath3-temperature .",
    "in general , the ground state is given by solving the condition @xmath26 this condition yields two solutions , @xmath27 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transition ] , the trivial solution @xmath28 is not stable for @xmath25 , but another solution @xmath29 is stable .",
    "furthermore , because @xmath30 is equal to the number density @xmath31 of superfluid , the following relation is satisfied below the @xmath3-temperature , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the superfluid density and @xmath6 is the mass of a helium atom . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : varphi ] ) , the chemical potential at zero temperature @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath5 is the total density of liquid helium-4 at zero temperature , and we have used the relation @xmath36 .    before deriving the formula for @xmath9 , we should see the spontaneous symmetry breaking .     the schematic temperature dependence of the effective potential @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath28 is not stable for @xmath25.,width=188 ]    for @xmath37 , the effective potential has only one minimum at @xmath28 , and then the global @xmath19 symmetry is not broken . for @xmath25 , the field @xmath15 rolls down from `` hill - top '' at @xmath28 to the bottom , and then the global @xmath19 symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "this phenomenon is the @xmath3-transition .",
    "the derivation of the formula for @xmath9 is very easy as follows .",
    "when @xmath38 , the scalar field @xmath15 is located at the bottom , and then it takes the nonzero value @xmath39 . hence the global @xmath19 symmetry",
    "is spontaneously broken in this phase .",
    "as the temperature increases above the @xmath3-temperature , the scalar field @xmath15 is located at @xmath28 , and the global @xmath19 symmetry is recovered . therefore , it is enough that we consider how energy is necessary to take the scalar field @xmath15 from the bottom to `` hill - top '' . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) , the depth of the potential @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number density of liquid helium-4 at zero temperature .",
    "the depth of the effective potential represents the required energy density to recover the global @xmath19 symmetry .",
    "because the scalar field @xmath15 has _ two _ degrees of freedom ( its amplitude and phase ) , the @xmath3-temperature is given by @xmath43     the potential per number density at zero temperature .",
    "the depth represents the @xmath3-temperature.,width=188 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : absolute_zero ] shows this situation . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : chemical ] ) , ( [ eq : depth ] ) , ( [ eq : energy - density ] ) and @xmath44 , we obtain the following formula for the @xmath3-temperature , @xmath45    using eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda-2 ] ) , one can calculate the @xmath3-temperature , because the experimental values of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are known . substituting the following values into eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda-2 ] ) , @xmath46 one obtains the theoretical value @xmath47 this is very close to the experimental values of 2.1768 k , and the deviation between the theoretical and experimental values is less than 1 % .",
    "thus , spontaneous symmetry breaking is a key concept to understand the @xmath3-transition .",
    "in this section , we calculate the roton energy gap at zero temperature @xmath0 using the effective potential  ( [ eq : potential ] ) .",
    "+ ( i ) _ linear decomposition _    because we are interested in the excitations near the ground state , it is convenient to define @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are _ real _ scalar fields .",
    "this decomposition is known as _ linear decomposition_. plugging ( [ eq : linear ] ) into ( [ eq : potential ] ) , we obtain the effective potential in terms of @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xmath51    in eq .",

    "( [ eq : varphi ] ) ) , we obtain @xmath54 this is the direct relation between the chemical potential at zero temperature and the @xmath3-temperature .    however , for the present purpose , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential - linear ] ) is more important , because the coefficient of @xmath55 term represents the potential energy of the real scalar field @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the coefficient of @xmath55 should be identified with the energy gap of roton at zero temperature @xmath56 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : chemical_0 ] ) and  ( [ eq : delta_0 ] ) , the roton gap @xmath0 is given by @xmath57 or @xmath58 substituting @xmath59 k into eq .",
    "( [ eq : rotongap ] ) , one obtains @xmath60 thus , our relation ( [ eq : rotongap ] ) is very precise .",
    "the deviation between the theoretical and experimental values is less than 0.1% .",
    "[ fig : roton - temp ] shows the roton energy gap as a function of temperature . from fig .",
    "[ fig : roton - temp ] , one can find that the relation @xmath13 is in good agreement with the experimental values at low temperatures ( @xmath61 k ) .    here",
    "we comment on the energy gap of phonon . because the coefficient of @xmath62 term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential - linear ] ) is zero , the energy gap of the scalar field @xmath50 is exactly zero .",
    "this means that phonon is gapless , and it is a consequence of the nambu - goldstone theorem .",
    "+ ( ii ) _ polar decomposition _",
    "although the linear decomposition is enough to calculate the roton energy gap , we consider another decomposition for completeness @xmath63 where @xmath7 and @xmath64 are _ real _ scalar fields .",
    "this is known as _ polar decomposition_. because the field @xmath64 is divided by @xmath65 , the fields @xmath7 and @xmath64 have the same physical dimensions . in this decomposition , the field @xmath64 is the nambu - goldstone mode and @xmath7 is the higgs mode .    plugging ( [ eq : polar ] ) into ( [ eq : potential ] )",
    ", we obtain the effective potential in terms of @xmath7 @xmath66 thus , we find that the nambu - goldstone mode @xmath64 vanishes in the effective potential .",
    "the field @xmath64 appears only in the kinetic terms in the lagrangian .",
    "therefore , the nambu - goldstone mode or phonon is clearly gapless .",
    "the physical meaning of the 1st and 2nd terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : polarpotential ] ) is the same as that of linear decomposition .",
    "the 1st term determines @xmath9 , and the 2nd term determines @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the linear decomposition and the polar decomposition yield the same physical results ; phonon is gapless and the roton gap is given by @xmath13 .",

    "the theoretical value is in good agreement with data.,width=264 ]",
    "in this section , we introduce the _ curvature matrix _ , which allows us to calculate the energy gap of elementary excitations more directly .",
    "first , let s consider the effective potential at @xmath38 @xmath67 here we introduce the @xmath68 curvature matrix @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the field value at @xmath38 ( see , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ground ] ) ) , @xmath72 because the matrix @xmath69 represents the curvature at the bottom of the effective potential , two eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath69 should be identified with the energy gap of elementary excitations at zero temperature .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential - zero ] ) , the curvature matrix @xmath69 is given by @xmath73 therefore , two eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath69 are @xmath74 these eigenvalues represent the energy gap of elementary excitations ; @xmath75 thus , using the curvature matrix , one can calculate the energy gap of elementary excitations very easily .",
    "finally , we comment on an open problem about the sound speed of phonon .     phonon - roton dispersion curve.,width=264 ]    according to the standard bogoliubov theory  @xcite , it is well known that the sound speed of phonon @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the mass of a helium-4 atom and @xmath34 is the chemical potential at @xmath38 .",
    "although the original bogoliubov theory can not calculate the sound speed _ quantitatively _ , we can calculate it because we have derived the relation ( [ eq : chemical_0 ] ) . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : chemical_0 ] ) and ( [ eq : soundspeed ] ) , one obtains @xmath79 where we have used @xmath80 g. this value is clearly inconsistent with the experimental value of 238 m / s . thus",
    ", although the original bogoliubov theory explains the linear dispersion of phonon ( @xmath81 ) , it fails to explain the sound speed quantitatively .",
    "here we propose a possible expression of sound speed , which is consistent with the experimental value . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : soundspeed ] ) ( of bogoliubov theory ) , if we replace @xmath78 by the effective roton mass @xmath82 , one obtains @xmath83 surprisingly , this is completely consistent with the experimental value as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] , but its physical origin still remains to be solved .",
    "this indicates that the roton effective mass ( or equivalently , the roton kinetic energy ) should be considered in order to calculate the sound speed of phonon .",
