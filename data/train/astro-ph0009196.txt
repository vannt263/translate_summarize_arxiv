    "extended structures resembling young dwarf galaxies are found in tidal debris from galaxy interactions ( mirabel et  al . 1992 ; duc & mirabel 1994 ; hunsberger , charlton , & zaritsky 1996 ) .",
    "star clusters form in abundance in the central regions of interacting galaxy pairs ( schweizer et  al . 1996 ; miller et  al .",
    "1997 ; whitmore et  al . 1999 ; zepf et  al . 1999 ) .",
    "what physical conditions drive the formation of stars and determine the nature of structure that forms in different environments ?",
    "can star clusters also form in tidal debris , how widespread is star formation in the debris , and how similar is it between different tidal environments ?",
    "the image in figure 1 is a 1000 second exposure in the f555w filter obtained on 1999 march 24 .",
    "a f814w image was also obtained .",
    "point sources with @xmath0 are indicated , those in the tail with white circles and those out of the tail with white squares .",
    "although this field is crowded with foreground stars due to its low galactic latitude , it is apparent that the numerous point sources are preferentially in the regions containing tidal debris .",
    "0.38 in    -0.4 in    -0.8 in    the colors , magnitudes , and sizes of these sources allow us to distinguish foreground and background contamination from star clusters in the debris .",
    "figure 2 illustrates that the brighter sources are relatively young star clusters ( i.e. hundreds of millions of years old ) , but some of the fainter ones could be individual stars .",
    "the reddest sources are most certainly foreground stars with @xmath1 apparent mostly from wf4 .",
    "there is an enhancement of point sources with @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the relatively large spread of the @xmath4 colors indicates either a range of ages , or non  uniform extinction by dust .",
    "the central region of ngc 3256 also has a large number of young clusters that contribute 20% of the total b  band luminosity of the galaxy ( zepf et  al .",
    "1999 ) .    in figure 3 , for the western tail",
    ", the @xmath4 color is plotted vs. the concentration index , defined as the difference between @xmath5 magnitudes measured in a 0.5and in a 3aperture .",
    "the solid circles represent sources in the tail regions while the open circles represent sources in regions outside the tail . clearly , the sources in the tail are on average larger , indicating that they are not point sources , and bluer . therefore , we confirm that there are many star clusters in this tail . in the eastern tail of ngc 3256",
    "we also find a significant number of star clusters , but they are not as abundant as in the western tail .",
    "we have also obtained hst / wfpc2 v and i band images of the tidal debris of three other mergers : ngc 4038/9 , `` the antennae '' , ngc 7252 , `` atoms for peace '' , and ngc 3921 .",
    "we detect several cluster candidates in ngc 7252 and ngc 4038/9 , and several super star clusters in the debris of ngc 7252 and ngc 3921 .",
    "however , the debris of the remnant ngc 3256 by far contains the largest number of massive star clusters , both in the eastern and in the western tails .",
    "apparently , the conditions in this remnant are more conducive to formation of these clusters .    clearly , not all tidal debris is equally conducive to the formation of these clusters .",
    "ngc 3256 is not distinguished from the other pairs by age or by total mass . however , its two tidal tails are the only ones of the eight we have studied that _ do not _ contain tidal dwarf galaxies .",
    "ngc 7252 , for example , contains in its western tail a bright dwarf with prominent patches of star formation , and in its eastern tail an extended low surface brightness dwarf . in both dwarfs",
    "there are point sources with @xmath6 , indicating that star formation continues well after the merger @xmath7 million years ago ( hibbard & mihos 1995 ) .",
    "perhaps the formation of small stellar structures ( star clusters ) and large stellar structures ( tidal dwarfs ) are mutually exclusive",
    ". detailed comparisons of cluster positions to high resolution 21  cm maps of content may also suggest factors that influence the formation and/or the packaging of stars .    a detailed report of results on the tidal debris in all four pairs , ngc 3256 , ngc 7252 , ngc 4038/9 , and ngc 3921 , has been submitted to the astronomical journal ( knierman et  al . 2000 ) .",
