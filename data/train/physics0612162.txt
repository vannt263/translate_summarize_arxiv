    "edge effects are usually introduced in electrostatic courses and provide an interesting and nontrivial example of electrostatic effects .",
    "this phenomenon corresponds to the divergence of the electric field and charge accumulation at the edges or corners of a conductor at a fixed potential .",
    "this singular behavior has various consequences and applications such as lightning rods and the field emission effect .",
    "the mathematical description of edge effect involves the solution of the laplace equation for the electric potential with fixed potential boundary conditions on the conductor .",
    "for example , for a corner with an opening angle @xmath0 in a two - dimensional geometry , the electric field @xmath1 and surface charge on the conductor behaves as @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 the distance to the tip.@xcite the electric field thus diverges at the corners when @xmath5 .",
    "alternative examples of edge effects can be found in other domains of physics .",
    "the minimal ingredients are a geometry with sharp edges ; a laplace - like equation for the physical quantity of interest ( for example , the electric potential ) ; and a boundary condition on the given geometry that imposes a fixed value of this quantity at its surface .",
    "evaporation of water vapor is one such example , as we will discuss in the following .",
    "edge effects arise in the context of molecular diffusion of water vapor . a diverging water vapor flux at the edges is predicted .",
    "such effects have been shown to be responsible for the formation of ring stains formed by drying coffee drops.@xcite    we consider another example of an edge effect induced by evaporation : the drying of potato wedges baked in an oven .",
    "the geometry of the potatoes is fixed by the cook : we shall focus here on potatoes cut with sharp edges , as for potato wedges .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] an example of ( home - made ) potato wedges ( after 20 minutes in the oven at @xmath6c ) .",
    "as can be seen the edges are much darker , and exhibit very strong drying .",
    "we will demonstrate that this drying is due to a diverging flux of water vapor at the extremities of the potato wedge in analogy with the edge effect in electrostatics .",
    "this divergence induces a strong dehydration of the potatoes in its wedges and corners .",
    "like most foods , potatoes contain a large amount of water . while increasing the temperature in the oven , the liquid - vapor thermodynamic equilibrium of water is displaced toward the vapor phase , which leads to the evaporation of the liquid water inside the potatoes to the surrounding air .",
    "let us consider the distribution of water vapor in the air around potatoes .",
    "its concentration @xmath7 obeys a diffusion equation : @xmath8 with @xmath9 the diffusion coefficient of the water vapor in air .",
    "we make the further assumption that the oven is in a quasi - stationary state , which implies that @xmath10    on the potato wedge surface , the value of the vapor concentration is fixed by the liquid - vapor thermodynamic equilibrium , and equals the saturation value @xmath11 calculated at the temperature of the oven .",
    "far from the potato , we expect that the air in the oven is not saturated and the concentration of vapor reaches a fixed value @xmath12 lower than saturation .",
    "because we are interested in the diffusion of water in the vicinity of the potato s surface , this far field boundary condition will not be required to characterize edge effects .",
    "the rate of evaporation of water at the potato s surface is given by the flux of water vapor , @xmath13 .",
    "the equation for the vapor concentration with the specified boundary conditions is identical to that of the electrostatic potential around a conductor at fixed potential .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "depends only on the geometry of the conductor / potato s surface.@xcite the vapor flux is analogous to the electric field and is therefore expected to diverge at the edges .",
    "both the edges and extremities of a potato will be considered : these will be modeled respectively in terms of two- and three - dimensional geometries .",
    "we now recall the basic steps in deriving the solution of eq .   in the context of our problem .",
    "a detailed description can be found in ref .  .",
    "first consider a two - dimensional geometry as in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "this geometry corresponds to evaporation at the border of a potato s wedge .",
    "the laplace equation for the vapor concentration is @xmath14 we look for a solution using separation of variables , @xmath15 , and find the equations for @xmath16 and @xmath17 :    @xmath18    with solutions @xmath19 , @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "the constant @xmath25 is fixed by the boundary conditions on the wedge s surface . to avoid a divergence of the concentration at the surface",
    ", we need to impose @xmath26 .",
    "imposing @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) yields @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "this condition also requires that @xmath25 satisfy @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 , with @xmath35 .",
    "we put these results together and write the vapor concentration as @xmath36 the coefficients @xmath37 are determined from the concentration far from the corner , and it is not necessary to determine their value for the discussion of the edge effects ..    the water flux at the surface of the potato can now be determined using @xmath38 .",
    "only the component of the flux perpendicular to the surface is non - vanishing . for @xmath28",
    ", we obtain : @xmath39 the first term in the sum is dominant close to the wedge , and the water flux behaves as @xmath40 as expected , this flux diverges at the edge for @xmath41 , that is , for a sharp wedge .",
    "the exponent of the divergence @xmath42 takes its maximum value , @xmath43 , in the very sharp limit , @xmath44 .",
    "note that the same exponent ( @xmath45 ) is found for the divergence of the surface charge close to the edge of a thin disk at fixed potential .",
    "our derivation can be generalized to the conical shape shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b).@xcite if we use spherical coordinates and assume azimutal symetry , the laplace equation becomes @xmath46 we look for a solution of the form @xmath47 and obtain the following equations for @xmath48 and @xmath49 :    @xmath50    it is convenient to rewrite the unknown constant @xmath51 as @xmath52 .",
    "the solution for @xmath16 can be written as @xmath53 ; the solution for @xmath49 is the legendre function of the first kind of order @xmath54 , @xmath55.@xcite the regularity of the solution at the origin imposes @xmath56 .",
    "the boundary condition at the surface of the potato , @xmath27 , leads to the following condition for the index @xmath54 : @xmath57 there is an infinite number of solutions for eq .  , which we denote as @xmath58 , with @xmath59 .",
    "following the same steps as for the two - dimensional case , we obtain the general solution as a linear combination of solutions : @xmath60 the water flux on the surface thus takes the form : @xmath61 close to the extremity of the cone , the first term in the sum is dominant leading to @xmath62     versus @xmath63 for @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ( from left to right ) .",
    "the arrows indicate the values of @xmath67 corresponding to @xmath68 .",
    "these values correspond to @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 ( from left to right ) .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath72 such that @xmath68 are @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , respectively.,width=321,height=226 ]    the exponent ( @xmath76 ) characterizing the singularity of the behavior at the sharp end is given by the smallest zero of the equation @xmath77 .",
    "in general , there is no analytical solution to this equation , because @xmath78 is expected to be non - integer . for @xmath79 ,",
    "that is , @xmath80 , the smallest solution of this equation is @xmath81 $ ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot @xmath82 versus @xmath67 for various @xmath72 . for example , @xmath83 has a zero at @xmath84 , which corresponds to @xmath85 .",
    "hence the solution of @xmath86 for @xmath87 is @xmath88 .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] also shows that the value of @xmath67 verifying @xmath89 goes to @xmath90 as @xmath72 decreases .",
    "hence for @xmath91 , the value for @xmath78 , which is a solution of the equation @xmath86 , goes to zero : @xmath92 as @xmath93 . this result can be shown more rigorously . in the limit @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96",
    "may be approximated as @xmath97$].@xcite therefore , using @xmath98 as @xmath99 , we deduce that @xmath78 may be approximated by @xmath100^{-1}$ ] .",
    "@xcite the important conclusion of these estimates is that for a very sharp cone , @xmath99 , the exponent of the singularity at the sharp end is @xmath101 and thus the flux divergence at the tip scales like @xmath102 .",
    "edge effects lead to a divergent flux of the water vapor at the edges and corners of potatoes .",
    "this singular behavior induces a strong drying of the potato near its wedges .",
    "this increased dehydration is responsible for the crunchy taste of the potatoes at their wedges .",
    "a few cooking remarks are in order .",
    "we have shown that the water flux divergence , and thus dehydration , is stronger as the angle of the corner or cone becomes smaller .",
    "the singularity of the water flux is stronger for a cone shape than for a edge : the water flux scales at most as @xmath103 for the two - dimensional wedge ( with @xmath104 the distance to the tip ) , and @xmath105 for a sharp cone .",
    "hence the drying of the potatoes is predicted to be much stronger at the sharp extremities of the wedge than at its edges as is observed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "deep fried wedges exhibit a similar behavior with stronger dehydration at the edges .",
    "this similarity may originate in the water vapor bubbles created at the surface of the wedge in hot oil .",
    "the above description may apply within the bubbles , although we expect that non - stationary effects of the diffusion process can not be neglected in such a situation .",
    "our simple calculations provide an interesting application of the diffusion equation .",
    "it has been successful in gaining the interest of the students in a course on the physics of continuum media . before presenting the calculation in a lecture",
    ", students may be asked to perform their own experiment at home and brainstorm on their observations and conclusions .",
    "the results may then be debated during the next lecture .",
