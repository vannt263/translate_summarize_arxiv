    "the galactic x - ray source gx 3394 was discovered by the _",

    "the source has been also observed in the radio ( fender et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) and an extended emission from a jet - like elongated structure was reported ( fender et al .",
    "1997 ) . optical observations ( e.g. , grindlay 1979 ; motch , ilovaisky & chevalier 1982 ; motch et al .",
    "1983 , hereafter m83 ; soria et al .",
    "1999 ) have not been able to identify the donor star ( see also a discussion in z98 ) .",
    "in fact , the observed optical radiation appears to be mostly produced in an accretion flow and/or an outflow .",
    "this is supported by the decline of the optical flux during a transition from a hard to a soft state ( m83 ; makishima et al .  1986 ) .",
    "interestingly , this type of transition is also accompanied by a decline of the radio flux ( corbel et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the presence of an accreting black hole in the system is also suggested by its fourier power spectra having the same characteristics at high frequencies as other black - hole candidates , but not neutron - star systems ( sunyaev & revnivtsev 2000 ) .",
    "also , its broad - band energy spectra are remarkably similar to those of a well established black hole binary , cyg x-1 ( e.g. , gierliski et al .  1997 , 1999 ) . however , no reliable constraints on the mass of the compact object exist ( see a discussion and references in z98 ) .",
    "x - ray and @xmath0-spectra of black holes in their hard states are successfully described by models with thermal comptonization of soft photons in optically thin plasmas of a temperature , @xmath6 k , and reflection of the comptonization spectrum from an optically thick , cold ( @xmath7 k ) medium , presumably an accretion disc ( sunyaev & trmper 1979 , zdziarski et al .",
    "1995 , gierliski et al .",
    "the disc is also likely to serve as the source of soft photons undergoing comptonization .",
    "this view is supported by the correlation between the spectral index of the comptonization spectrum and the amount of reflection observed in gx 3394 ( u94 , r01 ) and in other accreting black holes ( zdziarski , lubiski & smith 1999 ; gilfanov , churazov & revnivtsev 2000 ) .",
    "the role of magnetic fields remains an open question .",
    "they are probably involved in transfer and generation of energy either via viscosity mechanisms or reconnection processes . as a consequence",
    ", synchrotron radiation should be present and it may serve as a source of soft photons undergoing further comptonization .",
    "though for thermal plasmas this process appears to be typically negligible ( wardziski & zdziarski 2000 , hereafter wz00 ) , the presence of a weak non - thermal tail strongly amplifies synchrotron emission ( wardziski & zdziarski 2001 , hereafter wz01 ) .",
    "then , the synchrotron process can become a very effective source of soft photons , comparable to or stronger than the cold disc emission .",
    "consequently , detection of a non - thermal electron tail via a high - energy tail in a comptonization spectrum can put constraints on the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "in particular , observations of cygnus x-1 in its hard state suggest the presence of such a tail ( mcconnell et al",
    ".  2000 , 2002 ) . for this case ,",
    "wz01 obtained an upper limit on the magnetic field strength in the accretion flow and found constraints on the geometry .    here , we study those ( and some other ) issues in the context of gx 3394 .",
    "we analyze five _ ginga _ and _ rxte _ observations of gx 3394 which were simultaneous ( or nearly simultaneous ) with @xmath0-ray observations by the osse detector onboard _ cgro_.",
    "this provides us with data in the useful range from a few kev to a few hundred kev . the data reduction procedures and models we use",
    "are described in sections [ s : data ] and [ s : models ] , respectively .",
    "we present the results of spectral analyses in sections [ hard ] and [ off ] .",
    "consequences of the possible presence of a non - thermal electrons for accretion flow models are discussed in section [ s : nth ] .",
    "we investigate the connection between the x - ray and optical data in the framework of synchrotron self - compton models in section [ s : optical ] , while x - ray variability is examined in section [ s : variability ] .",

    "consequently , we also have fitted the soft excess by a second thermal comptonization component ( in addition to the main comptonization component responsible for the emission at @xmath128 kev ) .",
    "we find the excess can be fitted by emission of either an optically - thick plasma with @xmath129 and @xmath130 kev ( using comptt , titarchuk 1994 ) , or optically - thin one with @xmath131 , @xmath132 kev ( using compps ) . both models yield @xmath133 , and are analogous to the models of the soft excess in cyg x-1 by di salvo et al .",

    "we conclude that the data do not allow us to distinguish between different soft excess models .",
    "as far as the high - energy end of the measured spectrum is concerned , an important issue is the possible presence of a high - energy tail in the electron distribution .",
    "we have found that none of the osse data considered in this work have enough statistics at high energies to constrain the electron power law index , @xmath35 .",
    "we have thus chosen @xmath134 , which is close to the values measured in cyg x-1 , see gierliski et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and mcconnell et al.(2000 , 2002 ) , and it was used in the theoretical study of wz01 .",
    "we find that the _ ginga_-osse data are consistent with the presence of a high - energy electron tail , but they do not constrain its amplitude .",
    "e.g. , the non - thermal fraction , @xmath36 , for the data set 1 is @xmath135 .",
    "the presence of a tail is indicated by the result of z98 , who obtained @xmath136 when allowing for the presence of non - thermal electrons in their fit to the osse data from 1991 september 512 . however , an alternative explanation of the departure of the spectrum for the thermal one can be a distribution of the plasma parameters , in particular @xmath31 , either in time or in space .",
    "since the usable pca data extend down only to 3 kev ( compared to 1.2 kev for the _ ginga _ data ) , the soft excess can not be constrained by them at all .",

    "however , both the osse lightcurve and that from the all - sky monitor on board _ rxte _ ( available on the public database at xte.mit.edu/asm_lc.html ) have shown that the source was significantly variable on timescale of days during the observation . in particular , the osse spectrum underwent a significant softening and brightening during the two - week observation ( smith et al .",
    "the softening implies either @xmath31 or @xmath30 of the plasma decreasing with time , to that during the _ rxte _ observation ( three days after the osse one ) .",

    "we find the best - fit @xmath30 for the osse data of 2.4 , indeed larger than the value for the _ rxte _ data ( table [ t : fits ] ) .",

    "here , we explore some consequences of the possible presence of a non - thermal electron tail , found statistically necessary in our uniform - plasma model for the fourth observation .",
    "a weak non - thermal tail beyond a maxwellian distribution leads to a moderate hardening of the x - ray power law in the comptonization spectrum ( as repeated scattering off thermal electrons still dominates at those energies ) as well as it yields a weak high - energy photon tail at energies @xmath202 ( from scattering off non - thermal electrons ) , see , e.g. , wz01 . on the other hand",
    ", it can amplify the cyclo - synchrotron emission by a very large factor , due to the fact that the unabsorbed synchrotron radiation is emitted just by the high - energy tail of the electron distribution , which itself is strongly amplified by the tail with respect to the maxwellian ( wz01 ) .",
    "this amplified synchrotron emission within the comptonizing plasma provides then a copious source of seed photons . for given magnetic field strength , @xmath203 , and the plasma parameters , @xmath31 and @xmath30 , we can calculate the expected self - compton luminosity , which can exceed the observed @xmath70 in general .",
    "this provides a way to constrain @xmath203 , with the maximum one corresponding to all the seed photons being synchrotron ( see section 5.3 of wz01 ) . since we know that a cold medium is also present in the plasma vicinity , which medium is also a copious source of soft blackbody photons , the actual value of @xmath203 has to be even lower .",
    "first , we consider a hot accretion flow with nearly - virial ions ( e.g. , abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ; narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "following wz00 , we estimate the equipartition field strength within a radius of @xmath204 ( where most of the gravitational energy is dissipated ) as @xmath205 g. then , following the calculations in wz01 and using the hybrid electron distribution fitted to the data set 4 ( @xmath206 , section [ s : xte ] ) , we obtain the synchrotron  self - compton luminosity of @xmath207 erg s@xmath2 , which exceeds the observed one by a factor of @xmath197 . the condition that the predicted luminosity does not exceed the observed @xmath70 leads to @xmath208 g.",
    "although this is a factor of several below the equipartition , various processes dissipating magnetic field can lead to this condition to be satisfied in an actual accretion flow . on the other hand",
    ", the self - compton luminosity from the purely thermal electron distribution fitted to the data set 4 ( section [ s : xte ] ) would be only @xmath209 erg s@xmath2 , i.e. , negligibly small compared to the observed @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the non - thermal tail amplifies thus the synchrotron emission by a rather large factor of @xmath210 .",
    "consequently , most of the seed photons for comptonization have to be emitted by a cold medium if the tail is very weak or absent .",
    "we have also considered the configuration of small , active regions above a cold disc , in which regions dissipation of magnetic field occurs ( see wz00 for details of the assumed model ) . assuming that magnetic field dissipates at 10 per cent of the alfvn speed in 10 active regions of the size @xmath45 cm",
    ", the magnetic field required to dissipate enough energy to reproduce the observed @xmath70 would be @xmath211 g. then , however , the synchrotron  self - compton luminosity from the hybrid plasma would be @xmath212 times the observed @xmath70 .",
    "it would be @xmath213 for @xmath214 g , which field , however , would not be able to dissipate enough energy to power the observed @xmath70 .",
    "we thus conclude that the non - thermal electron tail fitted to the data rules out the active regions model for the hard state of gx 3394 .",
    "the same conclusion was obtained by wz01 for the hard state of cyg x-1 .",
    "also , z98 found the model of active regions for the hard state of gx 3394 to be ruled out based on independent spectral considerations .",

    "an anticorrelation can appear , e.g. , if the cyclo - sychrotron emission is variable ( due to variability of some plasma parameters ) but the total luminosity is approximately constant .",
    "the spectral variability would then show a pivot between the optical and x - ray ranges , which naturally leads to an anticorrelation between the respective emission .",
    "furthermore , m83 found that the optical emission leads the x - rays by @xmath229 s. at @xmath230 kev ( table [ t : fits ] ) , it takes @xmath231 scatterings to upscatter a 2.7 ev photon to 10 kev . at @xmath232 , the source size required for the time lag to be due to the delay during compton upscattering",

    "a somewhat lower qpo period , @xmath8 s , was found in the data set 4 ( r01 ) .",
    "the time scale of flares of 20 ms found by m83 can then correspond to the light travel time across the source .",
    "a remaining unresolved issue would be then the lack of an anticorrelation found by m83 between the optical photons and those in the 1320 kev range .",
    "possibly , that energy range is dominated by compton reflection showing a different timing behaviour than the primary continuum .    on the other hand , fabian et al .",
    "( 1982 ) proposed that the anticorrelation is due to the x - rays below 13 kev being due to emission of colder clouds surrounding the hot plasma ( emitting both the optical emission and x - rays above 13 kev ) .",
    "however , present fits to x - ray spectra of gx 3394 as well as other black - hole binaries in the hard state tend to rule out this possibility , indicating that the entire x - ray emission is dominated by a single power law ( e.g. , u94 ; z98 , gierliski et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we note that similar optical / x - ray behaviour has been observed from the black - hole binary xte j1118 + 480 ( kanbach et al .",

    "also , a similar anti - correlation between optical and x - ray flux was observed , with the optical minimum leading the x - rays maximum by @xmath236 s. furthermore , the optical emission has a narrower auto - correlation function than that of x - rays , which implies that the primary variability is in the optical band .",
    "it is then possible that the optical emission is cyclo - synchrotron , which is then comptonized up to the x - ray range .",
    "the anticorrelation can be explained as in gx 3394 , by spectral pivoting between the optical and x - ray bands .",
    "the site of the hot plasma could be in principle an outflow , possibly a jet , which presence is indicated by radio observations in the hard state ( e.g. , fender et al .",

    "( 1999 ) , whereas they observed broad , single - peaked profiles in the hard state .",
    "they attributed the difference in the line profiles to the origin of the line in the outflow in the hard state and in the disc in the soft state .",

    ", there is no natural interpretation to the frequency of the optical qpo in the outflow model . a way to test the origin of",
    "the optical radiation would be to measure its polarization , which would be non - zero in an outflow with a directed magnetic field .    while the optical spectrum may in principle be either quasi - thermal and produced in an accretion flow or purely non - thermal and produced in a jet , our fits to the @xmath0-ray high - energy cutoff confirm that the distribution of electrons producing the main x/@xmath0-ray continuum in the hard state has a predominantly thermal character ( even if it does originate in an outflow , as , e.g. , in the coronal outflow model of beloborodov 1999a ) .",
    "this represents a strong argument against the model of the x/@xmath0-ray continuum of black - hole binaries as being predominantly non - thermal ( markoff , falcke & fender 2001 ) . in that model ,",
    "the predicted position of the cutoff in the photon spectrum is very sensitive to the magnetic field strength and details of acceleration and cooling .",
    "markoff et al .  ( 2001 ) deal with this problem by fine - tuning the high - energy cutoff in the distribution of the non - thermal electrons .",

    "on the other hand , this uniformity is accounted for in the thermal ( or quasi - thermal ) model , in which the compton cooling ( e.g. , zdziarski 1998 ) and/or @xmath237 pair production ( e.g. , malzac , beloborodov & poutanen 2001 ) naturally constrain the electron temperature to @xmath238100 kev .",

    "it is thus more likely that we observe a change of the variability pattern in the comptonization continuum itself .",
    "we propose that it could take place in a similar scenario to that considered in section [ s : optical ] when analyzing the optical and x - ray variability .",
    "namely , if the total comptonization luminosity remains constant but the flux in seed photons varied , this would result in a pivoting of the spectrum .",
    "the pivot energy would in general depend on the spectral index and the temperatures of the electrons and the seed photons . because a part of the spectrum closer to the pivot energy would be less variable than that further away",

    "the dependence on the upper frequency can be explained if the pivoting occured mostly on long time scales .",
    "we note that a similar pivoting is indeed observed in cyg x-1 on very long time scales ( zdziarski et al .",

    "we note that the pivoting energy required by the above interpretation is different from that needed for explaining the optical / x - ray anticorrelation by varying cyclo - synchrotron seed photons in section [ s : optical ] . for that",

    "thus , the two interpretations are mutually exclusive .",
    "we have also calculated that the pivot at @xmath241 kev implies @xmath248 kev , which rules out the cyclo - synchrotron origin of the seed photons in our data set 4 .",
    "we point out , however , that the two variability patterns were observed in two different observations of gx 3394 ( separated by 15 years ) , during which the state of the source could be different .",
    "also , the cause of the dependence of the rms on @xmath247 shown in fig .  [ f : var ] could be different than due to pivoting .",
    "it can possibly be explained , e.g. , by models of magnetic avalanches ( e.g. , poutanen & fabian 1999 ) , which predict complicated patterns of variability of flares on different time scales .",
    "we have analyzed four broad band x/@xmath0-ray spectra of gx 3394 in the hard state and found that they are well fitted by comptonization being predominantly thermal , compton reflection and fluorescent fe k emission with the strength compatible with that of the reflection .",
    "this provides a further confirmation of the dominance of those physical processes in this object , and black - hole binaries in the hard state in general .",
    "it also argues against the non - thermal model for the origin of the x/@xmath0-ray continuum of black - hole binaries by markoff et al .",
    "we also study time variability in our best x - ray data set , and find a decline of the fractional rms with increasing photon energy , again consistent with previous findings for this source .",

    "our major finding here is that the very strong fe k line present in our data ( as well as in other reported proportional - counter off - state observations of this source ) is _ not _ intrinsic to gx 3394 , but is due to the strong diffuse 6.7 kev emission in the galactic center region .",
    "we also obtain a number of other results , which , however , are less unambiguous and require future further studies .",
    "this is due to either the limitations of the available data or insufficient theoretical understanding at the present time .    in the off state",
    ", we find a spectral hardening at @xmath179 kev , which we find to be incompatible with thermal comptonization but , rather , compatible with the presence of a bremsstrahlung spectral component .",
    "such a component is in agreement with theoretical predictions , but its unambiguous detection is hampered by the low signal - to - noise ratio and lack of sufficient coverage at high energies .    in the hard state , we find a statistically significant departure from the pure thermal comptonization spectrum at high energies in our best spectrum .",
    "we interpret it as due to the presence of a weak high - energy tail in the electron distribution .",
    "however , we can not rule out an alternative explanation of the effect of the plasma parameters varying in space and/or time .",
    "the possible presence of a high - energy electron tail has implications for the strength of the magnetic field in the source , from the consideration of compton scattering of the cyclo - synchrotron emission .",
    "the magnetic field strength is constrained to values somewhat below equipartition ( with hot ions ) in the case of a hot accretion disc .",
    "interestingly , the four hard - state spectra have very similar intrinsic x - ray slope , @xmath165 .",
    "on the other hand , the high - energy cutoff energy decreases with increasing luminosity , and , correspondingly , the fitted thomson optical depth of the plasma increases with luminosity .",
    "the significance of the correlations is strongly increased if we allow for the presence of a high - energy electron tail in our model .",
    "such a correlation is in agreement with theoretical predictions for hot accretion flows .",
    "still , it is based only on the four available spectra , and studies of more broad - band spectra with similar x - ray slope , @xmath37 , are highly desirable .",
    "we also study the origin of the strong optical emission found in the past to be associated with the x - ray bright hard state .",
    "we find the reported optical emission can be due to the cyclo - sychrotron process , and the emission also provides seed photons for comptonization .",
    "the presence of a high - energy electron tail alleviates constraints on the emission region , allowing it to be smaller and with a weaker field .",
    "the reported optical / x - ray anticorrelation can be due to the synchrotron emission being variable at an approximately constant total luminosity , which leads to a spectral pivot between the optical and x - ray bands .    on the other hand , we find the dependence of the rms variability on energy",
    "can be also explained by variable seed photons , but the pivot point is then at @xmath249 kev , i.e. , in conflict with the previous model .",
    "thus , a comprehensive model of both of these variability patterns requires more complications , probably more source components .",
    "this research has been supported in part by the foundation for polish science and kbn grants 5p03d00121 , 5p03d00821 and 2p03d00514 .",
