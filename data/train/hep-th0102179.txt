    "a comprehensive review and a list of references , see the book @xcite ) , the conformal invariance of the massless scalar field with the non - minimal coupling constant @xmath9 was first noted by penrose @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the framework of quantum field theories in curved space - time",
    ", the non - minimal coupling term can also be introduced by the requirement of renormalizability @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) . in cosmology",
    "( see @xcite @xcite and references therein ) , the usage of the non - minimal coupling in the inflation models @xcite and models for the cosmological constant problem @xcite @xcite ( first proposed by dolgov @xcite ) has been widely explored .",
    "in addition , the non - minimal coupling is also involved in an interesting model called `` induced gravity '' which was first proposed by zee in 1979 @xcite and is still explored nowadays ( e.g. a series of work about induced gravity and inflation by kao @xcite ) .    the role of the _ non - minimal coupling _ in ssb and phase transitions in 4d space - time has been widely discussed ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "it has been pointed out that the non - minimal coupling with the ` external ' gravitational field may lead to ssb .",
    "it has also been noted that ssb and phase transitions can be induced by curvature via the non - minimal coupling with the ` external ' gravitational field @xcite .",
    "accompanying the quest of symmetry breaking and vacuum stability in curved space - time , that the curvature can be a symmetry - breaking factor has been shown .",
    "note that , in the papers mentioned above , the effect of the curved space - time is taken into account by introducing an ` external ' gravitational field , which means that the metric tensor of the space - time is treated as a background , and the _ ricci scalar _",
    "@xmath10 in the non - minimal coupling term is regarded as an ` external ' parameter ( like the temperature of a macroscopic system in thermodynamics ) .",
    "this is different from our usage of the gravitational field to be discussed below .    in this paper , we propose an alternative way to achieve ssb in 4d and arbitrary higher ( @xmath2 ) dimensional space - time .",
    "we will show that , by introducing the _ non - minimal coupling _ between the scalar field and gravity and keeping the negative ( mass)@xmath4 @xmath5 term , we can build up a new scenario to implement ssb without using @xmath11 term .",
    "avoiding the usage of @xmath11 term could be a benefit when we consider ssb in the higher dimensional space - time , because @xmath12 term is non - renormalizable in the formalism of quantum field theories in @xmath2 dimensional space - time .",
    "the gravitational field introduced in this paper is not an ` external ' field or a background field , but strongly depends on the scalar field through the einstein equations .",
    "such a strong dependence plays a crucial role in implementing ssb in our scenario .",
    "this is one of the essential differences between the previous work mentioned in last paragraph and our work in this paper .",
    "to illustrate our idea specifically , we consider a simple case in the third part of this paper : a world with an arbitrary space - time dimension which is dominated by the ` cosmological constant ' , the ` vacuum energy ' , and the ` potential energy ' in the classical framework also contributes a energy - momentum tensor which has the same cosmological - constant form when @xmath7 is constant in space - time.[origin of effective lambda ] ] .",

    "we will see that , if we treat the _ ricci scalar _ @xmath10 as a parameter and write the potential as @xmath37 the `` coefficient '' @xmath38 can be negative for small @xmath5 and positive for large @xmath39 in some situation .",
    "and hence the potential @xmath40 behaves similarly to the well - known potential ( eq .  (",
