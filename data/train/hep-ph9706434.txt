    "in this talk i will discuss the possibilities of detecting non - physics thorough virtual effects at a high - energy linear collider . in the description of these effects",
    "i will use the effective lagrangian formalism .",
    "it is a commonly held belief that the standard model is but the low - energy limit of a more fundamental theory .",
    "in fact there is a myriad of models which reduce to the  at low energies ( below , say , @xmath0 ) but which exhibit a plethora of new effects at smaller scales .",
    "i will adopt this paradigm with the added condition that there is a energy gap between the  scale @xmath1 and the scale of new physics @xmath2 .",
    "one important goal of the approach i will follow ( for general references see @xcite and references therein ) is to obtain reliable estimates ( or reliable bounds ) for @xmath2 using current data ; this information can then be used to estimate the energy at which new colliders must operate .",
    "note that there are interesting models which do _ not _ satisfy @xmath3 .",
    "for example , many supersymmetric theories predict light , non-  scalars of masses below @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "one can discuss such theories using the formalism to be developed below , but in order to do so the spectrum at low energies must be modified to include all the light supersymmetric particles .",
    "i will not consider this possibility here ( see  @xcite )",
    ".    given the presence of a gap we can imagine integrating out all the heavy excitations of the theory .",
    "the effective interactions ( for the light particles ) generated in this manner are summarized in an effective lagrangian .",
    "schematically , denoting the heavy fields by @xmath5 , the light fields by @xmath6 , and the action for the theory underlying the  by @xmath7 , then the effective action is @xmath8\\ ; \\exp ( i s ) \\right]\\ ] ] note that @xmath9 will have a dependence on @xmath2 , and that @xmath10 assumed much larger than any of the light physics scales ( including the energy at the available experiments ) .",
    "thus one can do an expansion in powers of @xmath2  @xcite ( up to possible logarithmic factors ) , @xmath11 where @xmath12 can be expanded as a linear combination of _ local _ operators , @xmath13 ( any logarithmic dependence on @xmath2 is contained in the coefficients @xmath14 ) .",
    "the terms @xmath15 correspond to the ; the @xmath10 dependence of these terms is unobservable  @xcite . the contributions @xmath16 summarize the virtual heavy - physics effects",
    "if the action @xmath17 is known then one can calculate the coefficients @xmath14 in terms of the parameters of the heavy theory , but one can also take a complementary approach and parameterize _ all _ possible heavy physics effects using these quantities .",
    "this is the approach taken here .",
    "there are no general statements concerning the _ global _ symmetry properties of the various terms @xmath12 .",
    "it is quite possible for some terms to have a given global symmetry which is absent in others .",
    "a clear example is baryon number violation : the , corresponding to @xmath18 , automatically conserves @xmath19 ( ignoring possible instanton effects  @xcite ) ; on the other hand there are contributions to @xmath20 which violate @xmath19 ( for example , assuming the underlying theory to be the @xmath21 gut there are well - known baryon - violating operators of dimension 6 generated by the exchange of heavy vectors  @xcite ) .    in contrast",
    "local symmetries must permeate all the @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "since the  is assumed to be @xmath23 symmetric , the same will be true for all higher - dimensional operators @xmath24 . since each operator",
    "will then involve several interactions this can result in a reduction in the number of undetermined parameters .",
    "for example , the dominating non - standard contributions to the triple _ and _ quartic gauge - boson vertices ( excluding gluons ) appear in @xmath20 and involve only 4 independent coefficients .",
    "in contrast the most general lorentz invariant expression for the triple gauge - boson ( not including gluons ) vertices involve 13 unknown coefficients   will generate the remaining 9 contributions , but the corresponding coefficients are suppressed by a factor of @xmath25 . ]    the effective approach described above is natural  @xcite , consistent  @xcite and its predictions have been verified repeatedly ( even for strongly coupled theories , see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "one important feature of the effective lagrangian approach is the possibility of estimating the coefficients @xmath14 .",
    "it then becomes possible to isolate those operators whose coefficients are not _ a priori _ suppressed and will potentially generate the strongest deviations from the .",
    "the coefficients estimates strongly depends on the low energy scalar spectrum .",
    "i will consider two possibilities ( for a more complicated scenario see  @xcite ) :    * _ light higgs case : _ the light spectrum is taken to correspond to that of the  with a single light doublet . in this case , assuming naturality  @xcite , the heavy theory should be weakly coupled  @xcite .",
    "the dominating operators will then be those generated at tree level ; the list of such operators appeared in ref .",
    "subdominant operators appear with coefficients suppressed by a factor @xmath26 . * _ chiral case : _ the light spectrum corresponds to that of the  with no physical scalars . in this case",
    "the symmetry breaking sector is strongly coupled  @xcite and the coefficients can be estimated using naive dimensional analysis  @xcite .    with these estimates",
    "@xmath2 has a direct interpretation . for the light higgs case it represents the mass of a heavy excitation ; for the chiral case it represents the scale at which the new interactions become apparent .",
    "in this talk i will consider only the light higgs case .",
    "the above estimates are verified in _ all _ models where calculations and/or data are available . in choosing processes with which to probe the physics underlying the  one",
    "should therefore concentrate on reactions where the dominating operators ( those with the largest coefficients ) contribute .    as an example one can study the @xmath27 and @xmath28 vertices ( cp conserving ) in the case where there are light scalars .",
    "the dominating ( non- ) operators have dimension 6 ; there are two of them : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the @xmath32 and @xmath33 field - strengths respectively , with gauge coupling constants @xmath34 and @xmath35 ; @xmath36 etc . denote @xmath37 indices and @xmath38 the doublet . gauge coupling constants are explicitly included since gauge field couple universally .",
    "incidentally it is worth noting that @xmath39 is the only cp conserving non-  operator generating vertices with @xmath40 ( electroweak ) gauger bosons .",
    "the effective lagrangian contains terms @xmath41 which in terms of the usual notation  @xcite translates into @xmath42 since the operators are loop generated we have @xmath43 and @xmath44 so that a measurement stating @xmath45 corresponds to @xmath46 . in order to obtain non - trivial information about @xmath2 from @xmath47 or @xmath48",
    "we need to measure these coefficients to a precision of @xmath49 .    on the other hand",
    "the effective operator @xmath50 is generated at tree level ( @xmath51 ) and current bounds  @xcite correspond to @xmath52 .",
    "this implies that any new ( weakly - coupled ) physics generating this operator will not be seen directly below this scale .",
    "an example may serve to illustrate the above results .",
    "the effective lagrangian describing neutron @xmath53 decay is @xmath54 , with @xmath55 .",
    "the above arguments suggest @xmath56 with @xmath2 of the order of the mass of a heavy particle ( up to coupling constants ) .",
    "but one could also have written @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the neutron mass , which is certainly fine , one must only remember that @xmath59 .    it is , of course , possible for some coefficients to be suppressed by an unknown symmetry .",
    "in this case one can not distinguish between such a suppression and a large value of @xmath2   does not generate a given operator @xmath60 , it is still possible for some heavier physics with scale @xmath61 to generate @xmath60 ; the bounds obtained then refer to @xmath61 . ] .",
    "in contrast there is no known mechanism for enhancing the above estimates by more than a factor @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "for example , if one imagines that there are @xmath63 particles contributing to a given operator at the one - loop level the coefficient corresponding to this operator will be @xmath64 which can be @xmath65 for @xmath66 . in this case , however , the theory can not be analyzed using perturbation theory , in particular , the higgs mass becomes of order @xmath2 and disappears from the low - energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "in the case where there are light scalars there are three types of operators involving the top quark generated at tree level . all these operators are @xmath67 gauge invariant .    * _ four fermion interactions .",
    "_ examples are , @xmath68 ( where the second is suppressed since it violates chiral symmetry and contributes to the electron mass ) . * _ gauge - boson couplings .",
    "_ for example @xmath69 where @xmath6 denotes the  doublet .",
    "* _ scalar couplings .",
    "_ for example , in the unitary gauge , @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the physical scalar .",
    "in contrast operators such as @xmath72 and @xmath73 are generated at one loop by the underlying theory and their coefficients are suppressed by a factor @xmath74 .    from this one",
    "can infer the types of reactions which involve the top quark and which can best probe the physics underlying the .",
    "it is also possible to determine the _ type _ of new physics which generates the higher - dimensional operators .",
    "for example , the first of the operators in ( [ eq : four.fer ] ) would be generated by a heavy vector , the operators ( [ eq : gauge.coupl ] ) are also generated by virtual heavy vector bosons  @xcite , etc . in many reactions",
    "only one operator dominates the cross section , in these cases one can also specify the type(s ) of new physics which are probed by this process under consideration .",
    "one reaction where new physics effects might be probed is in @xmath77 production through @xmath76 fusion .",
    "this process is interesting among other reasons , because the cross section increases with energy   collider can be found in  @xcite . ] .",
    "the new physics effects which can be probed in this process are those modifying the @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 vertices .",
    "the relevant operators are ( the contributing graphs are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : graphs ] ) .    @xmath82 $ ] = _ operator _ + @xmath83 @xmath84 + @xmath85 @xmath86 , @xmath87 + @xmath88 @xmath86 , @xmath89 , @xmath84 + @xmath90 @xmath86 , @xmath87 + @xmath91 @xmath89 + @xmath82 $ ] @xmath92 +    the existing data only bounds the @xmath93 coupling for which @xmath94 for a left - handed coupling and @xmath95 for a right - handed one .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the @xmath96 coupling can be measured to a 1%  accuracy at both the lhc and the nlc  @xcite    the total cross section proves to be a mediocre probe for new physics ; see for example , fig  [ fig : total.cs ]    a more sensitive probe is the forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath97 which can exhibit deviations of few@xmath98 from the  prediction .",
    "assuming an efficiency of 18%  @xcite we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : afb ] that a @xmath99 nlc will be sensitive to scales @xmath2 up to @xmath100 .",
    "the most important contribution to this process is the @xmath101-channel @xmath102 quark exchange and so this process is most sensitive to the @xmath93 vertex .",
    "the deviations from the  in this interactions come from a heavy @xmath103 , as , for example in fig .",
    "[ fig : wtb ]",
    "* better probe of new physics involving the top quark are the reactions @xmath104",
    "@xcite at the tevatron and @xmath105 at a @xmath106 nlc  @xcite . in the first case",
    "a sensitivity to scales up to @xmath107 can be reached and up to @xmath108 for the second reaction . * as an example of reactions which probe physics not containing the top quark a good example is the process @xmath109",
    "@xcite which is strongly affected by an effective vertex of the form @xmath110 generated by a heavy @xmath111 vector boson .",
    "the reach in @xmath2 of this process is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : eezh ] ; for details see  @xcite",
    "the nlc will provide a very powerful tool for probing virtual non - physics .",
    "the effective lagrangian approach provides a rationale for the choice of processes to study , this method has been tested severally and its predictions and estimates agree with all known calculations and experiments . among the processes involving the top quark",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry is sensitive to new physics both in the direct and the @xmath76-fusion reactions .",
