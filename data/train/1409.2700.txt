    "we use as a metric for convergence the energy shift of the four member hf molecules of the central unit cell .",
    "the energy shifts perform well in this role as these quantities are very sensitive to the surrounding environment .",
    "small deviations due to the addition of more hf molecules to the crystal ( the invariance to adding more molecules to the system being the definition of bulk limit ) become evident on the milli- and microhartree scale , well within the numerical convergence of our calculations .",
    "the initial @xmath154 cube is a largely artificial construct in this bulk limit scaling analysis .",
    "it is included as it illustrates the expected monomer energy shift symmetry between adjacent hf chains .",
    "as is clear for the following small cluster sizes ( 3 - 4 per side ) , the energy shift varies greatly within the central unit cell .",
    "this is expected ; surface effects still drastically affect the central system .",
    "scaling the cluster size past 5 molecules per side demonstrates that the @xmath161 energy shift is essentially converged , with the @xmath123 contribution nearly so .",
    "the accelerated convergence of the @xmath161 energy contributions can be understood from the fact that this term is dominated by dispersion- and induction - type interactions , which drop off as @xmath162 with the intermolecular distance .",
    "thus contributions from anything beyond nearest neighbors are necessarily going to be small .",
    "this is contrasted by the @xmath123 contribution which is dominated by long - range dipole type interactions that do not fully converge until at least 7 molecules per side .",
    "we find the @xmath123 energy shift converges for both the @xmath20 polar and non - polar cube with an energy variance within the unit cell of less than a micro - hartree .    with the perturbed hf molecular wavefunction on hand ,",
    "it is straightforward to compute the first - order response properties . in this work ,",
    "we examine the dipole moment , via using the first term of eq .",
    "[ 1pprop ] . computing",
    "the dipole moment for each hf molecule in the lattice produces an imperceptible change from the gas phase dipole moment of 1.90 debye .",
    "this result is expected as the idea of a local monomer density within a polar crystal is merely a theoretical construct .",
    "the average hf lattice site dipole moment per unit cell can still be assigned by computing the non - local exchange contribution to the electronic density and then assigning a portion of the density to a specific hf molecule domain .",
    "the non - local density is computed using eq .",
    "[ 1pdmexch ] , which uses the scf exchange density between nearby molecule pairs . taking all these effects into account ,",
    "the computed average dipole moments within the central unit cell are found to be 2.51 and 2.49 debye for the polar and non - polar structures respectively .",
    "these are in excellent agreement with the published values @xcite of 2.51 and 2.47 debye using mp2/aug - cc - pvdz .",
    "any quantity directly dependent on the monomer wavefunction ( and energy ) , including environmental effects , is of course obtainable within the mcpt framework .",
    "monomer structures , conformational orderings , and vibrational spectra are some examples that could be examined .",
    "we can further illustrate the utility of the mcpt method by computing the harmonic vibrational ( stretch ) modes of the non - polar polymorph of the hf lattice .",
    "this kind of property is readily computed numerically by displacements of the nuclear coordinates and thus requires no new methodological advancement . with knowledge of the orthorhombic @xmath163 stretch modes @xcite",
    ", we can obtain the requisite single point calculations by performing symmetric displacements about the f - h equilibrium along the four specific stretch modes ( @xmath164 ) within the unit cell . a 5-point grid for the finite - difference second derivative with a displacement step size of @xmath165  ",
    "was used with the approximation that the fluorine atoms remain fixed .",
    "the single point energies used are constructed additively from eqs .",
    "[ em1 ] and [ em2 ] by @xmath166 where the sum is over the four hf molecules in the central unit cell . having",
    "identified that the monomer shift of the central unit cell in the @xmath20 lattice has converged to the bulk limit , we use the same crystal size and lattice constants for the frequency calculation for consistency .",
    "the resulting stretch frequencies are given in table [ freqtable ] as well as a reference lccd harmonic frequency calculation for the gas phase hf molecule .",
    "we recover most of the observed frequency shift relative to the gas phase , with our predicted ordering and relative energies in agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "as also observed in prior periodic wavefunction results @xcite , the further lowering of the @xmath167 and @xmath168 modes relative to the @xmath169 and @xmath170 modes is not achieved .",
    "this comparison with the values from sode _ et al .",
    "_ is relevant as theirs are the only other computational value in the literature .",
    "further improvement to the absolute placement of the predicted spectra can be expected through optimization of the lattice parameters , larger basis sets , and other improved approximations which we leave to future work .",
    ".[freqtable]computed harmonic vibrational frequency for the gas phase hf molecule and the four stretch modes of the non - polar polymorph hf crystal ( 10@xmath17110@xmath17110 lattice ) .",

    "in this work we have focussed on two specific goals : the formulation of a new explicit molecular cluster based perturbation theory , and a program implementation of said perturbation theory that is capable of scaling to the bulk limit .",
    "our first goal has led us to develop the linearly scaling second - order molecular cluster perturbation theory .",
    "mcpt(2 ) contains infinite - order contributions to the monomer electronic correlation energy and is infinite - order in the pairwise dimer interaction ( infinite - order by including all pairwise , and all possible products of pairs ) .",
    "we started with coupled - cluster perturbation theory with the particle excitation rank hamiltonian partitioning , as used by us before @xcite , with the reference wavefunction taken to be a product of monomer hartree - fock wavefunctions . limiting the cluster expansion to only monomer and dimer interactions ,",
    "a similarity transformation is performed to obtain effective hamiltonians that only operate on the monomer , @xmath173 , and dimer , @xmath174 , hilbert spaces .",
    "these effective hamiltonians allow us to directly use the ccpt framework , and help elucidate the pairing between cluster operators of the surrounding cluster on that of a given monomer or dimer .    by working with at most explicit pairwise interactions within a cutoff , the prohibitive @xmath11 computational scaling of a full ccsd explicit calculation",
    "is reduced to @xmath175 ( @xmath133 is the maximum number of monomers possible within the given cutoff radius ) . for the benchmark crystal",
    "studied here ( the @xmath20 hf square crystal ) , the computation savings of going from the full ccsd to the mcpt(2 ) framework is a factor of @xmath176 , with an additional factor of @xmath177 ( @xmath178 ) savings through the inclusion of a cutoff .",
    "independent of the methodological choices that reduce computational cost , the use of innovations in the computer science of the sia model despite the reduction due to pairwise interactions , the necessary arrays remain large . the automatic partitioning and inherent block sparsity capability provided by sia",
    "has allowed us to perform our largest hf crystal calculations on just 256 processors within a standard @xmath157 hour queue length .    by using the mcpt(2 )",
    "framework , we obtain not just monomer energies that include interactions of the surrounding system to infinite - order , but also the specific monomer wavefunction as well .",
    "this opens up future investigations not just in monomer energetic such as vibrational energy shifts or monomer conformer orderings , but also direct computation of first and second - order properties of the monomers .",
