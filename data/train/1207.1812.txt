    "one considers the inverse scattering problem of the retrieval of the shape of perfectly conducting cracks buried within a homogeneous medium .",
    "data are scattered field measured at the search domain boundary .    to our knowledge , inverse scattering with a single , perfectly conducting crack in 2-d satisfying",
    "a dirichlet boundary condition has been studied in @xcite . in this reference ,",
    "the retrieval algorithm was based on a newton - type iterative scheme so that a good initial guess close to the unknown crack was needed to ensure convergence .",
    "but an iterative scheme generally requires a large amount of computational time , and it is hard to extend to the reconstruction of multiple cracks unless strong hypotheses are made beforehand .",
    "so , non - iterative reconstruction algorithms have been developed , e.g. , multiple signal classification ( music)-type ones @xcite , topological - derivative - based ones @xcite .",
    "recently , a multi - frequency algorithm has been proposed ; related works are in @xcite and references .",
    "but in many cases , the analysis is not fully reliable , in particular since phenomena such as the unexpected appearance of ghost replicas can not be explained .    here",
    ", one is proposing an improved imaging algorithm for perfectly conducting cracks from scattered field data measured at the search domain boundary , and one analyzes its structure by designing a multi - frequency imaging functional weighted by each frequency .",
    "this involves that elements of the multi - static response ( msr ) matrix normalized by a test function can be represented in a suitable asymptotic form . via careful analysis",
    ", one can infer a relationship between the proposed imaging functional and bessel functions of integer order and explain why this imaging functional yields location and shape of the cracks .",
    "the discussion goes as follows . in section [ sec:2 ] ,",
    "the direct scattering problem is summarized and the asymptotic expansion formula introduced . in section [ sec:3 ] the multi - frequency - based imaging functional weighted by each frequency is put forth and its properties discussed .",
    "numerical experiments are in section [ sec:4 ] for single and multiple cracks .",
    "conclusion is in section [ sec:5 ] .",
    "in this section , one considers 2-d electromagnetic scattering by a perfectly conducting crack , @xmath0 , fully buried within a homogeneous domain @xmath1 .",
    "one assumes that @xmath0 is a narrow , linear crack represented as follows @xmath2 and that it does not touch the boundary @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath4 .    throughout this contribution",
    ", we remain with the transverse magnetic ( te ) polarization case : at a given frequency @xmath5 , let @xmath6 be the time - harmonic total field that satisfies @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the outward unit normal vector to @xmath3 and @xmath9 are the @xmath10 vectors that describe the directions of incidence , assumed equi - distributed on the unit circle @xmath11 . in the same manner , @xmath12 satisfies ( [ bvp ] ) without @xmath0 .",
    "then , the following asymptotic relationship of @xmath6 and @xmath12 holds uniformly on @xmath13 ( see @xcite for instance ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the neumann function for @xmath17 , @xmath18",
    "one assumes that there exist @xmath19 different small cracks @xmath20 with same length @xmath21 centered at @xmath22 , @xmath23 , in @xmath17 .",
    "we apply the asymptotic formula ( [ asymptoticexpansionformula ] ) to establish an imaging functional of the crack . for this ,",
    "one uses the eigenvalue structure of the msr matrix @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the normalized boundary measurement data : @xmath26 here , one eliminates the residue term of ( [ asymptoticexpansionformula ] ) and chooses a test function @xmath27 .",
    "now , one designs an imaging functional .",
    "first , one performs the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of @xmath28 , so that @xmath29 where @xmath30 are ( non - zero ) singular values and where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are left and right singular vectors .",
    "then , one introduces a weighted imaging functional at several discrete frequencies @xmath33 as @xmath34 where @xmath35 it should be noted that @xmath36 satisfies the following properties ( see @xcite ) @xmath37 if one assumes that numbers @xmath10 and @xmath38 are large enough , applying ( [ similarproperties ] ) to ( [ imagingfunction ] ) yields @xmath39,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 denotes the bessel function of order @xmath41 and of the first kind .",
    "a full derivation is to appear in an extended version of this contribution .",
    "some properties of @xmath42 are as follows :    * @xmath43 reaches its maximum value at @xmath44",
    ". hence , @xmath45 plots are of large and small magnitudes at @xmath46 and at @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "* when @xmath38 is small , @xmath45 plots exhibit replicas at local maxima and minima of @xmath48 .",
    "* @xmath10 must be large enough .",
    "it means that if one applies this algorithm with a small @xmath10 , poor results follow .",
    "moreover , by looking at ( [ elementm ] ) , this analysis can not be applied to the limited - view inverse scattering problem . * using frequencies high enough guarantees successful imaging performance . *",
    "based on the statistical hypothesis testing @xcite , the proposed algorithm is robust vs. random noise when @xmath38 is large enough .",
    "in this section , one introduces numerical examples for imaging small and long arc - like cracks .",
    "the operation frequency is taken of the form @xmath49 ; here @xmath50 , @xmath51 , is the given wavelength .",
    "the @xmath52 are equi - distributed in the interval @xmath53 $ ] with @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "a white gaussian noise with @xmath56db signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is added to the unperturbed data .",
    "figure [ resultplot ] displays maps of @xmath57 for three small cracks ( _ left _ ) , a long single crack ( _ center _ ) , and two long cracks close to one another ( _ right _ ) .",
    "notice that the analysis above is restricted to the small crack case , but it can be applied to extended ( long ) ones .",
    "although some replicas appear since the chosen value of @xmath38 is rather small ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath45 plots exhibit maximum amplitudes at the location of the cracks so that one can recognize their shape . taking them as initial guess could yield more accurate shapes via a newton - type algorithm @xcite or a level - set method @xcite .",
    "based on the structure of the singular vectors of the msr matrix at several discrete frequencies of operation , an improved image function motivated from kirchhoff migration has been proposed to image perfectly conducting cracks . the proposed imaging functional is related to bessel functions of integer order .",
    "numerical experiments with noisy data are discussed and they show the effectiveness of the corresponding imaging algorithm .",
    "the current contribution deals with a full - view inverse scattering problem .",
    "application to a limited - view inverse problem is forthcoming work . along the same line of thought ,",
    "extension to cracks with neumann boundary condition should be an interesting subject .",
