    "ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are point - like , off - nuclear , extra - galactic sources , with observed x - ray luminosities ( @xmath1 ) higher than the eddington luminosity for a stellar - mass black - hole ( @xmath2 ) . the true nature of these objects is still debated @xcite .",
    "although the definition of ulxs encompasses different types of sources , the majority of them are likely to be accreting bhs in binary systems . however , there is still no unambiguous estimate for the mass of the compact object hosted in these systems . assuming an isotropic emission , in order to avoid the violation of the eddington limit",
    ", ulxs might be powered by accretion onto intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) with masses in the range @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it has been also suggested that ulxs appear very luminous because of beaming @xcite , super - eddington emission @xcite , a combination of these effects @xcite or because they contain a moderately high mass bh ( @xcite ) .",
    "an approach to study the nature of ulxs is through time variability .",
    "the analysis of the aperiodic variability in the x - ray flux of x - ray binaries is a powerful tool to study the properties of the inner regions of the accretion disc around compact objects ( for a review see @xcite ) . in particular , quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos )",
    "provide well - defined frequencies , which can be linked to specific time scales in the disc .",
    "qpos in black hole binaries ( bhbs ) can be broadly divided into three classes : ( i ) qpos at very low frequencies ( @xmath4hz ) , probably associated to oscillations and instabilities in the accretion disc ( see @xcite ) ; ( ii ) low - frequency qpos ( lfqpos ) , with typical frequencies between 0.1 and 10hz , probably connected to similar oscillations in neutron star systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) , over whose origin there is no consensus ; in black hole binaries ( bhbs ) 3 main different types of lfqpos have been identified ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ) ; ( iii ) high - frequency qpos ( hfqpos ) , with a typical frequency of @xmath5hz , in a few cases observed to appear in pairs @xcite .",
    "it is currently unclear whether these qpos have constant frequencies and whether they have special ratios @xcite .",
    "however , since they identify the highest frequencies observed in these systems , they are the best candidates for association with , e.g. , the keplerian frequency at the innermost stable orbit . whatever their physical nature , as they originate in the inner regions of accretion discs around black holes , these features are expected to be produced also in ulxs .",
    "however , if ulxs contain imbhs of @xmath6 , the frequencies are correspondingly smaller .    in this paper",
    "we report on the results from a joint spectral and timing analysis of five @xmath7ks _ xmm - newton _ observations of m  82 performed on march - november 2011 .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ observ ] ,  [ analysis ] we present the timing and spectral analysis of the data .",
    "[ results ] reports the detection of qpos in the data , together with a comparison with previous findings .",
    "the results from the spectral analysis and the relationship with the timing properties are also shown . finally , in sec .",
    "[ discuss ] we discuss our results .",
    "m  82 x1 ( also named cxou  j095550.2 + 694047 ) is one of the brightest ulxs in the sky .",
    "its host galaxy is the prototype of starburst galaxy and is located nearby , at a distance of 3.9mpc @xcite , making m  82 x1 , with an average x - ray luminosity @xmath8@xmath9 , an excellent target for performing x - ray studies .",
    "the position of m  82 x1 is within @xmath10 of the position of the infrared source and super star cluster mgg  11 @xcite .",
    "simulations of the dynamical evolution of the cluster mgg  11 show that stellar collisions in its extremely dense core may have led to the formation of an imbh @xcite .",
    "@xcite found qpos in the range 50110  mhz which they identified as arising from m  82 x1 ( and later confirmed by @xcite using _ chandra _ data ) . if the qpo frequency is associated with the orbital frequency around a non - rotating black hole , then it would imply a mass limit of @xmath11 .",
    "the qpos were discovered in _ xmm - newton _ data and confirmed in _",
    "data @xcite .",
    "the qpos are only occasionally detected in the _ rxte _ data and no apparent correlation between qpo detections and the source flux level has been found .",
    "based on a comparison of the spectral and timing properties of stellar - mass black hole x - ray binaries , @xcite estimated a mass of the order of @xmath12 for the compact object producing the qpos .",
    "the method uses the photon index - qpo frequency correlation that has been seen in bhbs @xcite .",
    "the qpos were confirmed in a longer _ xmm - newton _ observation , where their frequency was 113  mhz @xcite .",
    "also @xcite estimated the mass of the bh to be in the range @xmath13 .",
    "their method relies in the location of the ulx in the variability plane of bhs , that relates the mass of the bh with its timing properties .",
    "the x - ray source m  82 x2 ( also named cxou  j095551.4 + 694043 ) was identified as a transient ulx in m  82 from multiple x - ray observations with _",

    "@xcite argued that m  82 x2 is more likely to be an imbh than a stellar - mass object accreting from a massive star according to its transient nature and high outburst - luminosity ( @xmath15@xmath9 ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported significant timing noise near 1mhz from m  82 x2 in one _ chandra _ observation that later @xcite confirmed it in the form of a milli - hertz qpo . identifying the frequency of this qpo to that of a lfqpo and applying a linear mass - frequency scaling relationship",
    "@xcite derived a value of @xmath16 for the mass of the bh .",
    "in this work we analyzed the recently publicly available observations of m  82 x1 collected by the _ xmm - newton _ satellite ( see tab .  [ log_obs ] for details ) .",
    "the epic camera was operating in the _ full frame _ mode and with the _ medium filter _ set .    for the timing analysis , we filtered the epic pn+mos event files , selecting only the best - calibrated events ( pattern@xmath17 for the pn and the mos , respectively ) , and rejecting flagged events ( i.e. keeping only flag@xmath18 events ) from a circular region on the source ( centre at coordinates @xmath19 , @xmath20 ; @xcite ) and radius @xmath21arcsec .",
    "many gaps in the light curves were present .",

    "for the spectral analysis we used only the epic pn camera , in order to avoid issues due to cross - calibration effects . additionally , the epic pn camera has a higher effective area ( i.e. double ) than each one of the mos cameras and has sufficient statistics for the fit .",
    "we applied the standard filtering of removing time periods with high count - rates in the fov in the 10 - 12kev energy range ( epic - pn only ) .",
    "we filtered the event files , selecting only the best - calibrated events ( pattern@xmath22 for the pn ) , and rejecting flagged events ( flag@xmath18 ) .",
    "we extracted the flux from a circular region on the source centred at the coordinates of the source and radius @xmath21arcsec ( the same as the region used for the timing analysis ) .",
    "the background was extracted from a circular region ( with a radius of @xmath23arcsec ) , centred in a position in the same chip , far away from the boundaries and not far from the source .",

    "in this work we report on the finding of two qpos at a mean frequency value of @xmath26mhz in the observations of the ultra - luminous x - ray source m  82 x1 .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ observations have been performed in the time interval of @xmath27days , over which we detected ( at different significance levels ) qpos with different frequencies , i.e. a qpo at 46mhz in obs .  1 ,  3 , and a qpo at 8mhz during obs .  2 .",
    "these three observations have been performed in the time interval of only @xmath28days , indicating the fast variability in this source can change on a scale of only a few weeks . for obs .  4 ,  5",
    "we do not detect any significant qpo ( we obtained @xmath29 upper limits of @xmath30 for the fractional rms of a qpo at @xmath26mhz for these observations ) .",
    "additionally , we find that the qpo frequencies are roughly consistent with being anti - correlated with the flux from the high - energy component . despite its low statistical significance , we refer to the last paragraph of this section for the discussion of the 8 milli - hertz qpo and the possibility that it is coming from the nearby ulx m  82 x2 .    comparing the qpo at @xmath26mhz with previous findings ( @xcite ; see tab .",
    "[ log_qpos ] ) we see that all the detections have been distributed roughly in the 1:2:3 ratio ( see fig .  [ qpos_time ] ) , with exception of the qpos found by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found qpos distributed rather uniformly over the frequency range @xmath31mhz .",
    "this is in contrast from what has been found by @xcite , where these qpos are roughly equally spaced in frequency in a 1:2:3 ratio with the qpo at @xmath28mhz as the fundamental one . as described in sec .",
    "[ results ] we saw that , applying the same significance criteria that we used for our observations , only two qpos from @xcite can be considered as significant ( the second only marginal ) detections , one at @xmath32mhz and the other at @xmath33mhz ( see fig .",
    "[ qpos_time ] ) .",
    "a qpo at a frequency similar to @xmath32mhz has been tentatively identified in a _",
    "chandra _ observation as coming from m  82 x2 .",
    "the qpo at @xmath33mhz is similar to what has been found previously in the case of m  82 x1 .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ qpos_time ] we can see that the frequencies of the qpos cluster at around the frequencies @xmath34mhz , in which @xmath35mhz is the mean value of the frequencies from tab .",
    "[ log_qpos ] in the range @xmath36mhz , that we will refer to as the fundamental qpo frequency hereafter .",
    "the lines in fig .",
    "[ qpos_time ] ( which would correspond to the fundamental qpo , and twice and three times this value ) show that the values for the first and second group of frequencies are closer to the expected harmonic values than the spread of the points around the fundamental . nevertheless , it is difficult to assess for the significance of the clustering of the qpos around the previous frequencies , due to the scarcity of points .",
    "previously , @xcite pointed out to the 1:2 frequency ratio for the qpos at frequencies @xmath37mhz , using all the available data at that time .",
    "we suggest with our analysis ( together with the results from the previous analysis by @xcite and @xcite ) that the qpos from m  82 x1 are in fact roughly distributed harmonically in the 1:2:3 ratio , taking all the available data so far",
    ". the final proof would be to detect all these harmonic qpo simultaneously but , as discussed in the next paragraph , that coincidence is unlikely , given the detection limits from the current instrumentation and/or length of the current observations .",
    "we have found that the frequency of the qpos from m  82 x1 do not appear to be distributed randomly , but seem to prefer special values , although the number of detections is too low to prove it .",
    "in addition to this , these values are also compatible with being simple multiples of each other . both facts lead to the suggestion that the qpos in m  82 x1 could be interpreted as the first identification of hfqpos in a ulx , in analogy to the hfqpos already identified in bhbs .",
    "nevertheless , a major difference with the case of bhbs is that in the latter the fundamental frequency has never been observed .",
    "the characteristics of our qpos ( high values for the coherence and fractional rms ) and their location at the high - frequency break of the low - frequency noise have some similarities with the type - c lfqpos found in bhbs @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these characteristics do not exclude other classifications , since we are only able to detect the brightest signals .",
    "hfqpos in bhbs are signals at frequencies 35450hz observed in a few systems .",
    "these correspond to the time scales expected from the keplerian motion in the innermost regions of the gravitational well of the bh .",
    "there is evidence that in bhbs these oscillations appear at specific frequencies and , in a few cases , pairs of peaks have been observed simultaneously .",
    "these pairs of peaks have been interpreted associating the qpo frequencies to relativistic time scales at a specific radius , where these frequencies are in resonance , resulting therefore in special frequency ratios @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , other models ( see @xcite and references therein ) make predictions about frequencies of the high - frequency peaks , but do not lead to specific ratios . in the case of m  82 x1 ,",
    "as @xcite pointed out , it could be that the presence of one dominant qpo , i.e. 50 or 100 or 150mhz in different observations , is not an unusual occurrence and can be explained as the result of the local driving frequency conditions in the coronal region .",
    "this leads to the fact that a resonance condition is established for one particular eigenmode of the compact coronal region so that this mode is predominantly observed .",
    "if the qpo detected in m  82 x1 is a fundamental hfqpo , then it appears at much lower frequency ( @xmath28mhz ) than those observed in bhbs ( 35450hz ) , by three orders of magnitude . scaling linearly with the mass of a stellar - mass bh ( @xmath38 )",
    "if these qpos have the same origin , the frequencies we have found lead to a mass of @xmath39 ( taking into account the whole range of possible values of the spin of the bh ) for the mass of the bh in m  82 x1 .",
    "other mass estimates , this time based on spectral - timing scaling relationships from systems of different mass @xcite , have provided a mass estimate of @xmath40 @xcite . nevertheless , caution is required in order to apply relationships based solely on the mass of the bh systems . as already pointed out by several authors ( @xcite for agns ; @xcite and @xcite for ulxs )",
    "the accretion rate is an important parameter that , together with the mass of the bh , should be considered as the main drivers in these scaling relationships .",
    "this effect could lead to a much smaller mass for the bh , i.e. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition , it remains to date unclear how timing properties and bh masses are related , and what are the properties of the accretion states in ulxs compared to those of galactic bhbs .",
    "regarding the low - frequency ( @xmath41mhz ) qpo , it is unlikely that it is an analogous to the hfqpos observed in bhbs , since its frequency is much lower than @xmath28mhz . if it was the fundamental harmonic analog to the hfqpos observed in bhbs , many harmonics should have been observed , but none has been detected so far . the low frequency of this qpo would instead indicate an analogy to the low - frequency qpos ( lfqpos ) observed in bhbs .",
    "lfqpos with frequencies ranging from a few mhz to @xmath42hz are a common feature in almost all bhbs . despite lfqpos being known for several decades ,",
    "their origin is still not understood and there is no consensus about their physical nature . nevertheless , any model describing the origin of lfqpos associates them to the inner parts of the flow around bhs .",
    "if this association is correct , scaling the frequency linearly with the possible values for the mass of m  81 x1 ( @xmath43 ) leads to a frequency of 0.08 - 8hz for the lfqpos in stellar - mass ( @xmath38 ) bh .",
    "this range of frequencies is compatible with those observed for lfqpos in bhbs .",
    "milli - hertz qpos in the range of ( 2 - 7)mhz have been previously detected in m  82 x2 @xcite , with a coherence value ( defined as the frequency of the qpo divided by its fwhm ) of @xmath44 .",
    "the low - frequency qpo in our case is much narrower , with a coherence value of @xmath45",
    ". nevertheless , such high values of the coherence ( i.e. narrow qpos ) are typical of the most common qpos observed in almost all sources . in our case , as in @xcite the detection of the milli - hertz occurs only when m  82 x2 is luminous , above @xmath46 .",
    "this suggests the idea that the milli - hertz qpo is from m  82 x2 . in order to test this",
    "further , in a way similar to @xcite , we extracted the flux from two separated halves of a circular region centred in m  82 x1 for all the observations .",
    "we found that the qpos from m  82 x1 fall below the detection threshold in all the separate halves .",
    "but in the case of obs .",
    "2 we detect a qpo at @xmath41mhz only in the half circle which contains m  82 x2 .",
    "this strongly suggests that for this observation the observed signal is associated to m  82 x2 .",
