    "in recent years , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) has proved to be very helpful in obtaining information about the electronic states of strongly correlated systems . while a lot of data is available from experiments , reliable theoretical calculations of the one - particle spectral function  which can often be regarded as being proportional to the arpes spectrum  for popular models of , e.g. , the hubbard or @xmath0-@xmath1 type , are usually very demanding . as a consequence ,",
    "many interesting problems of condensed matter physics have not been investigated systematically regarding their spectral properties in a satisfactory way . among them",
    "is the `` _ bipolaron problem _ '' of two electrons , which can form a bound state even in the presence of strong coulomb repulsion if they are coupled to phonons . despite the long history of this problem ,",
    "bipolaron formation is still subject of ongoing discussion due to its potential role , e.g. , in high - temperature superconductors@xcite and manganites,@xcite two classes of materials studied extensively over the past decade .",
    "most existing results for the holstein - hubbard ( hh ) model considered here have been obtained using exact diagonalization ( ed ) .",
    "apart from a systematic error due to the necessary truncation of the hilbert space , this method gives exact results for the one - electron spectrum , but is restricted to rather small systems , especially for small phonon frequencies and/or strong electron - phonon coupling .",
    "consequently , it is difficult to study the dispersion of the spectral peaks throughout the brillouin zone . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "we employ here cluster perturbation theory ( cpt ) , extending the recent application to the holstein model with one electron.@xcite in contrast to ed , cpt permits to calculate the spectral function for continuous wavevectors .",
    "moreover , finite - size effects are strongly reduced compared to direct diagonalization of small clusters , and results are much more realistic than previous work based on , e.g. , a two - site system.@xcite cpt becomes exact in the weak- and strong - coupling regime , and has been successfully applied also to other problems.@xcite a review of cluster methods for strongly correlated systems is by maier _",
    "et al._@xcite here we would merely like to point out the recent application of the dynamical cluster approximation to the half - filled holstein model by hague.@xcite    in this work , we study in detail the formation of polarons and bipolarons , and its dependence on phonon frequency , electron - phonon and electron - electron interaction . to test the reliability of our results , and to interpret the quasiparticle ( qp ) features in the spectra , comparison is made to ed , as well as to the most accurate approach to the one - dimensional hh bipolaron currently available , namely the variational diagonalization method.@xcite moreover",
    ", we also investigate the form of the bipolaron band dispersion and compare it to that of models with nearest - neighbor- and next - nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin with a review of the hh bipolaron in sec .",
    "[ sec : holstein ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we discuss some details of the application of cpt .",
    "results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] and , finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the hh model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath2 here @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) create ( annihilate ) an electron of spin @xmath7 , and a phonon of energy @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) at site @xmath10 , respectively , and @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "the first two terms correspond to the kinetic energy of the electrons and the kinetic and elastic energy of the phonons , respectively .",
    "the electron - phonon ( el - ph ) and electron - electron ( el - el ) interaction is described by the third and forth term .",
    "we have three model parameters , namely the amplitude for nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath0 , the phonon frequency @xmath8 , the el - ph coupling constant @xmath13 , and the el - el interaction strength @xmath14 . for @xmath15 ,",
    "( [ eq : holstein ] ) is identical to the pure holstein model , while for @xmath16 we recover the hubbard model .",
    "we introduce the commonly used dimensionless coupling constant @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the bare bandwidth in d dimensions .",
    "we further define the dimensionless parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and express all energies in units of @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , the independent parameters of the model are @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 . in the sequel",
    ", we shall also use the polaron binding energy @xmath24 , which emerges as a natural parameter from the lang - firsov transformation.@xcite finally , the lattice constant is taken to be unity .",
    "owing to the complexity of even the two - electron problem , we will not discuss effects of bipolaron - bipolaron interaction here .",
    "an investigation of the latter , which will definitely play an important role in real materials , requires a study of the hh model with many electrons ( see , e.g. , ref .   and references therein ) , which is beyond the scope of our method in its present form .",
    "there exists a considerable amount of work on the hh bipolaron , although it is by far not as well understood as the simpler one - electron case . in the sequel",
    ", we restrict our discussion to new developments in the field .",
    "a very complete review of earlier work has been given by alexandrov and mott.@xcite    while the pairing of electrons in momentum space can be accurately described by migdal - eliashberg theory@xcite for weak - enough coupling , no reliable theory is available for the formation of bipolarons  corresponding to pairing of electrons in real space  at intermediate to strong el - ph interaction . in recent years",
    ", progress was made using either variational approaches@xcite or , more importantly , unbiased numerical studies based on ed,@xcite variational diagonalization,@xcite dmrg,@xcite and qmc.@xcite the ed and dmrg calculations were restricted to rather small systems consisting of two,@xcite four,@xcite six,@xcite eight@xcite or twelve sites,@xcite while the methods of refs .  ,   and   are almost free of finite - size effects .",
    "the larger number of phonon states required to obtain converged results makes numerical studies with ed methods even more challenging than for a single electron , especially for small phonon frequencies .    since the hh model represents a simplified description of the situation in real materials , it is highly desirable to study more complex models . to this end , it is interesting to note that the qmc methods of de raedt and lagendijk@xcite and macridin _",
    "et al._@xcite may be generalized to include dispersive phonons .",
    "furthermore , both approaches can be applied to models with long - range coulomb interaction,@xcite similar to the work of bona and trugman.@xcite finally , bipolaron formation in a model with jahn - teller modes  as present , e.g. , in perovskite manganites  has recently been investigated by shawish _",
    "et al._@xcite    to discuss bipolaron formation in the hh model , we have to distinguish between two cases .",
    "the two electrons can either have the same or opposite spin , which leads to a singlet or triplet state , respectively .",
    "we consider these possibilities separately .      for two electrons in a singlet state",
    ", the formation of a bound bipolaron state in the absence of coulomb interaction originates from the fact that the potential well  arising from a displacement of the oscillators  around an occupied lattice site deepens in the presence of a second electron .",
    "this may easily be seen in the atomic limit @xmath25 , using the lang - firsov transformation.@xcite on different lattice sites , each electron gains an energy @xmath26 by distorting the lattice , whereas the energy shift becomes @xmath27 if both particles occupy the same site ( _ small _ or _ onsite bipolaron _ ) . for @xmath28 ,",
    "the competition between the kinetic energy of the electrons on the one hand and the displacement or lattice energy on the other hand determines the cross over from a state with two weakly bound polarons , sometimes also referred to as a _ large bipolaron _ , for @xmath29 to a small bipolaron for @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the critical value of the el - ph coupling . in sec .",
    "[ sec : holstein ] , @xmath23 has been defined as @xmath32 , i.e. , as the ratio of the energy gain due to polaron formation to the kinetic energy of a free electron . while @xmath33 in the adiabatic regime for the small - polaron cross over in the model with one electron ( see , e.g. , discussion in ref .  ) , here we expect @xmath34 ( for @xmath35 ) due to the energy gain of @xmath36 per electron compared to @xmath26 in the single polaron problem .",
    "this is well confirmed by the calculations of wellein _",
    "et al._,@xcite who find a strong decrease of the kinetic energy near @xmath37 for @xmath38 .    for @xmath39 ,",
    "the lattice energy becomes important since the trapping of the carriers requires a sizable lattice distortion .",
    "this gives rise to the additional condition @xmath40 for a small bipolaron.@xcite similar to the one - electron problem , the cross over is very gradual in the nonadiabatic regime.@xcite the correlation or binding of the two electrons depends crucially on the phonon frequency , since the latter determines the maximum distance across which the two particles feel an attractive interaction due to the phonons .",
    "up to second order in @xmath13 , this coupling is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the phonon propagator .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : veff_pt ] ) reveals that the energy - dependent interaction is attractive for @xmath43 , and becomes instantaneous in the antiadiabatic limit @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "hence , the binding always decreases with increasing phonon frequency.@xcite    for @xmath14 , there is a competition between the retarded , attractive interaction mediated by the phonons and the instantaneous , repulsive hubbard interaction .",
    "consequently , a state with two unbound polarons  stabilized by the onsite repulsion  can exist for sufficiently weak el - ph coupling.@xcite this is in contrast to the extended hh model with long - range interaction , in which a bipolaron state is formed irrespective of the value of @xmath46.@xcite the effective el - el interaction in the hh model determining the nature of the bipolaron state is @xmath47 from this result , which can be obtained either from the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : veff_pt ] ) to @xmath48 in the limit @xmath44 , or in the antiadiabatic strong - coupling limit,@xcite one may be tempted to expect a bipolaron state to exist only for @xmath49 , i.e. , if there is a net attractive interaction between the particles .",
    "while this is true for the effective hubbard model onto which the hh model maps in the antiadiabatic strong - coupling limit , a consideration of virtual hopping processes leads to the less stringent condition @xmath50.@xcite the energy gain due to virtual exchange processes of two electrons on neighboring lattice sites  not suppressed by strong el - ph coupling  permits the formation of a weakly bound _ intersite bipolaron _ with the two electrons most likely to reside on neighboring lattice sites.@xcite a phase diagram for bipolaron formation as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath21 in one dimension has been presented by weie _",
    "et al._@xcite eventually , for sufficiently strong el - ph coupling @xmath51 , the effective onsite potential @xmath52 becomes attractive , and a small bipolaron is formed .",
    "starting from a small bipolaron , a cross over to an intersite bipolaron takes place when the coulomb interaction becomes large enough.@xcite the intersite bipolaron has a much smaller effective mass than the small bipolaron and may therefore also exist as a mobile carrier in real materials.@xcite in the adiabatic limit @xmath53 , the onsite  intersite bipolaron transition has been shown to be of first order,@xcite but for finite phonon frequencies it is expected to happen in a more gradual way because of retardation effects , in agreement with recent calculations.@xcite estimates for the region of existence of the intersite bipolaron state for @xmath54 are @xmath55 for weak coupling , and @xmath50 for strong el - ph coupling,@xcite and phase diagrams in the @xmath56-plane have been reported in one@xcite and two dimensions.@xcite while the above conditions are quite accurate in the nonadiabatic regime @xmath57 , the case @xmath35 remains an open problem .",
    "finally , the physically most interesting regime , which is unfortunately also the most difficult case to treat theoretically , is defined by @xmath35 , and a coulomb repulsion at least as large as the attractive interaction due to the el - ph coupling .      for two electrons of the same spin ,",
    "the pauli principle forbids double occupation of a site . in principle",
    ", a bound state may be formed with the two particles being located on different lattice sites .",
    "while two electrons can lower their energy by sharing a lattice distortion in the large bipolaron regime , especially for small phonon frequencies , the exchange process stabilizing the singlet intersite bipolaron state at intermediate - to - strong el - ph coupling and @xmath14 is not strong enough to bind two polarons in a triplet intersite state.@xcite furthermore , for @xmath58 , the ground - state energy of the triplet state is always larger than for a singlet state because two particles with parallel spin can not occupy the same @xmath59 energy level .",
    "finally , the singlet and triplet states become degenerate in the limit @xmath60 .",
    "as mentioned above , here we use cpt in combination with the lanczos recursion method.@xcite details about the application to el - ph problems have been given in ref .",
    ", henceforth also referred to as i. the major difficulty we are facing in the present case is the larger number of phonon states needed to obtain converged results . from a physical point of view , this is not surprising since each of the two electrons will create a lattice distortion or phonon cloud , whereas there is only one dressed particle ( polaron ) in the case of the holstein polaron considered in i. however , in addition to the simple doubling of the number of particles , it has been shown by previous authors@xcite that multiphonon states play a more important role for the bipolaron as a result of the phonon - mediated binding .",
    "ed ( and also cpt ) for el - ph systems is affected both by finite - size effects and the truncation error due to the restricted number of phonon states kept in calculations .",
    "obviously , if one used very small clusters , good convergence with respect to the phonons could be achieved even for strong el - ph coupling . on the other hand , for small numbers of phonon states ,",
    "rather large clusters can be studied .",
    "the approach which has been widely used in the past is to require the truncation error , e.g. , of the ground - state energy , to be smaller than a certain limit , and to use the maximal cluster size which can be handled for this number of phonons . here",
    ", an additional challenge arises form the fact that the diagonalization of the cluster has to be performed for open boundary conditions.@xcite consequently , one can not exploit translational symmetry to reduce the dimensionality of the hilbert space .",
    "however , this drawback is clearly outweighed by the advantages of cpt outlined below .",
    "we would like to briefly discuss some interesting features of cpt .",
    "the method is based on a breakup of the infinite lattice into clusters of @xmath61 sites , say.@xcite the one - electron cluster green function , denoted here as @xmath62 [ see eq .",
    "( 4 ) in i ] , of the model under consideration is calculated for one of these ( identical ) clusters using open boundary conditions .",
    "this can be done , e.g. , using ed or analytical approaches.@xcite the hopping between adjacent clusters is then treated as a perturbation to obtain the green function of the original system , @xmath63.@xcite a basic limitation of the theory is that the hamiltonian must not contain any nonlocal interactions , except for one - electron terms . additionally , cpt in its present form can only be used to calculate one - particle green functions.@xcite therefore , interesting observables such as , e.g. , el - el correlation functions or transport properties are not yet available .    from the nature of the approximation made ,",
    "it is clear that cpt will work particularly well if the local interactions dominate the physics of the system , i.e. , for the case of the hh model ( [ eq : holstein ] ) , if @xmath64 .",
    "this point will be illustrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "the method becomes exact in the atomic limit @xmath25 , for noninteracting electrons ( @xmath65 ) , as well as for @xmath66.@xcite the quality of the results obtained with cpt has been tested for several models,@xcite and a very good agreement with other work has been found . in i , we pointed out the occurrence of finite - size effects which show up as additional peaks in the corresponding one - electron spectral function . the weight of the latter reduces quickly as @xmath67 , so that the spectrum is not affected significantly .",
    "one of the most important advantages of cpt is that it gives , in principle , results for an infinite system , although the approximate treatment of the intercluster hopping introduces some finite - size effects , which can be systematically reduced by increasing the cluster size . as a consequence",
    ", the one - electron green function can be calculated for any wavevector in the brillouin zone , even for @xmath68 .",
    "this allows one to study the dispersion of the qp peaks , in strong contrast to standard ed methods on finite clusters , for which only a few points in momentum space are accessible , owing to the rather small values of @xmath6920 usually used .",
    "since we only consider the one - dimensional hh model in the sequel , we shall adopt the notation accordingly .",
    "we are interested in the one - electron green function @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the ground state with one electron of spin down , and @xmath72 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : g_lanczos ] ) only contains the inverse photoemission part of the total one - electron green function . in the case of @xmath73 , the second part  corresponding to photoemission ( pe)vanishes , since there is no @xmath74 electron in the ground state .",
    "moreover , for @xmath75 , pe is identical to the spectrum of a single polaron , which has been studied in detail in i. the situation would be different if we started with a two - electron ( singlet or triplet ) ground state .",
    "then , the pe part of the one - electron spectral function also contains valuable information .",
    "however , due to limited computer memory , such computations involving three - electron states are not possible with the code used here .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_lanczos ] ) , we have omitted the energy @xmath76 of the ground state @xmath71 , which usually enters in the form @xmath77 , to permit direct comparison with the singlet bipolaron band dispersion @xmath78 in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "the one - electron spectral function is related to the green function  ( [ eq : g_lanczos ] ) via @xmath79 to calculate the cluster green function by ed , a truncation of the phonon hilbert space is necessary , and we use the same truncation scheme as in i. the number of phonon states @xmath80 will be chosen so as to push the truncation error @xmath81 of the energy @xmath82 of the two - electron ground state @xmath83 below @xmath84 .",
    "the use of @xmath82 to monitor convergence with respect to @xmath80 comes from the observation that  for the same number of phonons ",
    "the truncation error of the latter is always smaller than for the triplet state @xmath85 .",
    "this may be ascribed to the fact that for two electrons of the same spin , no bound onsite or intersite state exists . in particular , there will be no large local lattice distortion surrounding an onsite bipolaron , the description of which requires a significant number of phonons . in previous work on the hh bipolaron , using ed with periodic boundary conditions,@xcite the truncation error was usually smaller than @xmath86 .",
    "however , these methods were restricted to only a few @xmath87 vectors . furthermore",
    ", our calculations show that even a relative error @xmath88 ensures satisfactory convergence of the one - electron spectrum .",
    "the smaller number of phonon states enables us to use larger clusters and thereby significantly diminish finite - size effects since , within the cpt , even an increase @xmath89 noticeably improves the results .",
    "once the cluster size has been fixed , we use the maximal possible number of phonons .",
    "the accuracy @xmath90 varies for the different calculations and will be reported in each figure .    in its present form ,",
    "our method is restricted to the nonadiabatic regime @xmath57 , except for weak el - ph coupling . to study smaller phonon frequencies",
    " relevant to , e.g. , to transition metal oxides  a combination with variational diagonalization techniques , or the use of shared - memory systems would be necessary . as in i , we restrict our calculations to the spectral function , which is the most fundamental quantity that can be obtained from cpt.@xcite",
    "the one - electron spectral function of the problem considered here has been calculated before using ed@xcite and dmrg,@xcite both in one dimension . however , results were only given for @xmath91 , and for very small systems with @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively . with the above methods , and for periodic boundary conditions , the spectral function  ( [ eq : akw ] ) can be evaluated for @xmath61 different wavevectors , of which only @xmath94 are physically nonequivalent .",
    "this makes it difficult or even impossible to study the dispersion of qp features . recently",
    ", a parallelized dmrg code has been developed,@xcite which allows studies of one - dimensional holstein models on very large clusters even at half filling.@xcite however , the calculation of spectral functions within dmrg is very time - consuming , since it has to be done separately for each point on the energy axis .",
    "several authors have also calculated dressed spectral functions,@xcite with the fermion operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g_lanczos ] ) replaced by their lang - firsov transformed ( i.e. , dressed ) counterparts , as well as pair spectral functions.@xcite the corresponding spectra show a simplified structure in certain regimes , indicating that polarons and bipolarons are `` good '' qp s for these parameters .",
    "de mello and ranninger@xcite have pointed out that to study the cross over between polarons and bipolarons it is , in general , necessary to investigate both , photoemission and inverse photoemission .",
    "this can easily be understood by considering electron emission from the two - electron singlet ground state , i.e. , the green function @xmath95 .",
    "depending on the parameters , @xmath83 may either consist of two weakly bound polarons or a bipolaron .",
    "consequently , photoemission spectra will only show a single qp band .",
    "in contrast , the green function  ( [ eq : g_lanczos ] ) with @xmath96 corresponds to adding an @xmath74 electron to the one - electron ground state @xmath71 .",
    "for example , the additional particle can either go into the ground state to form a bipolaron , or into an excited polaron state .",
    "in general , we therefore expect two qp bands in the spectral function , whose weights , positions and widths vary with @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    as we will compare our findings with the variational diagonalization method ( vdm ) of bona _",
    "et al._,@xcite we would like to comment on the accuracy of the latter .",
    "the problem is defined on an infinite system , so that the approach is free of boundary finite - size effects .",
    "however , the method involves a variationally determined hilbert space with two variational parameters , namely the maximal allowed distance between electrons and phonons , and between the two electrons , respectively . for the bipolaron problem under consideration , the limiting parameter in the regime @xmath57 is the maximum distance @xmath97 between the two electrons .",
    "the results presented here have been obtained using @xmath98 . while the method gives very accurate results  with errors smaller than the linewidth in the figures  for the case of a small bipolaron ( @xmath99 ) , it is less reliable ( relative errors @xmath100 ) for strong onsite repulsion @xmath101 favoring two weakly bound polarons , similar to ed and cpt . due to additional towers of phonon excitations that are located in the neighborhood of the electron sites ,",
    "the method achieves good convergence in the small bipolaron regime even for strong coupling .",
    "nevertheless , the adiabatic regime @xmath35 represents a difficult problem , as is the case for other approaches . finally , as in cpt , results may be obtained at any wavevector .",
    "we shall see below that there is a close correspondence of the qp bands in the spectra to the polaron and bipolaron dispersion relations denoted here as @xmath102 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "the notation @xmath102 is convenient , but there is no spin - dependence in the case of a single electron , i.e. , @xmath103 .",
    "results for @xmath78 have been reported by wellein _",
    "et al._@xcite and weie _",
    "et al._@xcite however , in contrast to @xmath104 , @xmath102 and @xmath78 do not reveal the spectral weight of the corresponding qp s .",
    "nevertheless , the comparison with the spectra will yield valuable insight and serve as a test of the cpt results . moreover , a direct calculation of energy bands does not suffer from the restricted energy resolution of cpt due to the use of a smearing parameter [ eq .  ( [ eq : akw ] ) ] .",
    "owing to the limitations regarding the number of phonon states , we shall only show results for @xmath57 . to be more specific , we consider two values of the adiabatic ratio , namely @xmath105 and @xmath54 . for @xmath105 ,",
    "the spectra will turn out to be relatively simple , and we are able to study even strong el - ph coupling .",

    "the situation is similar to the hybridization of the coherent and incoherent parts in the one - electron case occurring for @xmath121 ( see i ) . of course",
    ", such effects are absent in the band dispersion of a system with two independent polarons .",
    "since the residual interaction between two polarons vanishes in the limit @xmath67 , the hybridization visible in the cpt spectrum may be attributed to finite - size effects .",
    "the latter originate from the fact that within cpt , translational symmetry is broken by treating inter- and intracluster hopping differently , and only approximately restored afterward .",
    "the spectral function @xmath111 , also shown in fig .",

    "the spectral weight of the low - energy peak in @xmath111 is small ( @xmath122 ) compared to the polaron peak in @xmath110 ( @xmath123 ) .",

    "both the narrowing and the loss of weight indicate a significant increase of the effective bipolaron mass .    while the polaron band lies relatively close to the bipolaron band at @xmath37 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_k_w4.0_u0.0](a ) ] , the increase of the coupling leads to a clear separation , and to a downward shift of both bands proportional to the polaron binding energy @xmath128 . in the antiadiabatic strong - coupling regime of fig .",

    "interestingly , in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_k_w4.0_u0.0](c ) , there is a mixing of the bipolaron state with one phonon excited , which lies an energy @xmath130 above the lowest band , and the two - polaron excitation .",
    "the polaron band also narrows with increasing el - ph coupling ( see also i ) .",
    "however , the effect is much smaller than for the bipolaron band",
    ". additionally , the spectral weight of the @xmath91 polaron peak in @xmath110 increases from about 0.20 at @xmath37 to about 0.32 at @xmath127 .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that for weak coupling [ fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_k_w4.0_u0.0](a ) ] , some of the weight of the polaron state is contained in the large low - energy feature .",
    "calculations for a single electron and the same parameters show that the spectral weight of the polaron at @xmath91 decreases from about 0.86 ( @xmath37 ) to about 0.52 ( @xmath127 ) .",

    "[ fig : spectrum_k_w4.0_u0.0 ] . finally , we also find a comparable reduction of spectral weight for the two - polaron band in @xmath111 from about 0.08 ( @xmath37 ) to about 0.04 ( @xmath127 ) at @xmath91 .    to conclude the discussion of the case @xmath105",

    "in particular , the weight of the latter is strongly enhanced at large @xmath87 , so that the bands are no longer easy to identify . therefore , and because of the strong mixing of the bands with coherent and incoherent excitations , it becomes difficult to accurately determine the spectral weight by integration over the cpt spectra .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_k_w1.0_u0.0 ] that the bipolaron bandwidth is much smaller for @xmath54 ( @xmath135 ) than for @xmath105 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_k_w4.0_u0.0](a ) ] , despite the fact that the value of @xmath23 is the same in both cases .",
    "hence , the effect of el - ph interaction on the bipolaron mass is much more pronounced in or near the adiabatic regime due to the larger mass of the oscillators .    in principle",
    ", the spectrum also contains coherent excited states which are separated from the lowest - energy band by less than the phonon energy @xmath8 .",

    "[ fig : spectrum_k_w1.0_u0.0](b ) ] .",

    "increasing @xmath23 further to 1.25 , we finally arrive at a bipolaron band with @xmath137 and a spectral weight of less than 0.03 at @xmath91 .",
    "similar to fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_k_w4.0_u0.0](d ) , the spectrum displays several bands equally spaced by @xmath8 , which belong to states with one or more phonons excited .",
    "moreover , the polaron and bipolaron bands are well separated , and the incoherent contributions dominate at large @xmath87 .    the agreement between the bipolaron band dispersion and @xmath78 in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_k_w1.0_u0.0 ] is again very good .",
    "similar to @xmath105 , the condition for a small bipolaron is given by @xmath126 , so that cpt yields very accurate results .",
    "in contrast , the two - polaron energy @xmath120 fits less well to the corresponding bands in the spectral function .",
    "we attribute this difference to the antiadiabatic regime ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_k_w4.0_u0.0 ] ) to the stronger retardation effects for @xmath54 . as a consequence ,",
    "the polaron state is more extended below the small - polaron cross over occurring at @xmath138 ( see , e.g. , i ) , leading to a stronger residual interaction on a finite cluster , which also manifests itself in the cpt results .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath105 , the lattice distortions around the electrons are very localized , and the two polarons are almost independent .",
    "above @xmath138 , i.e. , in the small - polaron regime , the two - polaron dispersion for @xmath54 again follows closely a two - polaron - like feature in the spectrum [ figs .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_k_w1.0_u0.0](c ) and  ( d ) ] .",
    "so far , we have only presented results for @xmath108 , for which a bipolaron state is always favored . however , in materials such as the cuprates or the manganites , strong local correlations hinder the carriers from forming onsite bipolarons even for strong el - ph coupling . to model",
    "such effects , we therefore consider here a finite value of the el - el repulsion @xmath139 .    in the case of two electrons with opposite spin ,",
    "the lanczos results for the cluster green function converge faster as a function of @xmath80 for @xmath140 compared to @xmath108 as a result of the reduced effective el - el interaction .",
    "this is fortunate , since it allows us to use slightly larger clusters , thereby partly compensating for the increased finite - size effects due to the spatially more extended ground state in the weak - coupling regime .    from the general discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : holstein ] , we expect the ground state to consist of two weakly bound polarons for @xmath141 , and a cross over to a bipolaron state at a critical value of the el - ph interaction @xmath23 . in the antiadiabatic limit",
    ", the latter is determined by @xmath142 ( i.e. , @xmath138 for the case considered here ) for weak coupling , and by @xmath143 for strong coupling .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_k_w1.0_u4.0 ] , we present the results for the spectral function , again for @xmath371.25 . for weak coupling @xmath37 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_k_w1.0_u4.0](a ) ] , the most striking difference to the @xmath108 case discussed above is the fact that there appears only one band at low energies . together with the incoherent contributions , and taking into account the doubling of the number of carriers leading to a shift of energies , the spectrum bears a close resemblance to that of a single polaron with the same parameters ( fig .  3 of i ) .",
    "this is also underlined by the polaron and bipolaron band dispersions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_k_w1.0_u4.0](a ) , which are almost identical throughout the brillouin zone , and lie just below the corresponding band in the spectral function .",
    "in particular , the band displays the typical flattening at large @xmath87 , where the low - energy excitations have mostly phononic character .",
    "furthermore , owing to the finite onsite repulsion , the low - energy band in @xmath111 is very similar to that in @xmath110 since , for finite @xmath22 and weak el - ph coupling , the singlet ground state consists of two weakly bound polarons .",
    "consequently , the singlet and triplet state have comparable energies , although the spectral weight in @xmath111 is again very small near @xmath91 .    for @xmath136 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_k_w1.0_u4.0](b ) ] , the ground state of the system is still given by two polarons , and the spectrum is almost indistinguishable from @xmath37 . in the present case , the condition for the existence of an intersite bipolaron is expected to lie between the weak- and strong coupling results @xmath55 and @xmath50.@xcite however , owing to its small binding energy , the intersite state is difficult to distinguish from the two - polaron state in the spectral function .    at @xmath144 [ fig .  [",
    "fig : spectrum_k_w1.0_u4.0](c ) ] , the band in @xmath110 begins to split .",
    "although the energy difference between the polaron and bipolaron band dispersions is still relatively small near @xmath91 , an excitation gap clearly emerges at larger @xmath87 . finally , at @xmath145",
    ", two distinct bands with similar spectral weight have formed , which agree very well with @xmath78 and @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the band in the triplet spectral function @xmath111 lies noticeably higher than the polaron band in @xmath110 .",
    "thus , for the parameters considered here , two polarons of opposite spin can lower their total energy by occupying the same lattice site , which is just the mechanism behind bipolaron formation .",
    "the abovementioned discrepancies between the bipolaron band dispersion @xmath78 obtained by shawish and the band in @xmath110 are a result of finite - size effects in the cpt calculations .",
    "the latter become smaller with increasing coupling @xmath23 together with the size of the bipolaron , and for @xmath145 we find a very good agreement [ fig .",

    "the results reveal that for weak coupling and intermediate @xmath22 , ed is superior to cpt concerning the convergence of the peak positions with respect to system size .",
    "this is not surprising as cpt is based on a strong - coupling expansion in the hopping term.@xcite here , the el - el and el - ph interaction are both of about the same magnitude as the hopping , so that the method does not work as well as for @xmath108 .    for @xmath140 ,",
    "finite - size effects in both , cpt and ed , are larger due to the extended bipolaron state which exists for weak coupling . similar to the one - electron case discussed in i , deviations from the exact results due to the finite cluster size are usually smallest for @xmath91 , while they become larger with increasing @xmath87 .",
    "although in fig .",
    "[ fig : size_u4 ] the positions of the peaks in the cpt spectral function are slightly less accurate than in the case of ed , the weights of the excited states resemble more closely the results in the thermodynamic limit .    finally , for @xmath146 , the cross over to a small bipolaron occurs at even larger values of @xmath23 .",
    "apart from the change of the critical coupling , the physics is not altered significantly .",

    "the intersite bipolaron state which exists for @xmath140 has a very small binding energy , so that the band dispersion is almost the same as that of two polarons .    to identify the origin of the deviations from a free - electron band , we also included in fig .",
