    "<S> we propose a magnetic dual of the coulomb blockade effect for quantum nucleation of flux vortex pairs in high-@xmath0 superconducting ( hts ) films and grain boundaries in zero applied field . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic blockade instability occurs at @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the `` vacuum '' or theta angle . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 term has recently been discussed in the context of several other systems , including charge and spin density waves , topological insulators , the quantum hall effect , and spontaneous cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> our model predicts a sharp pair creation threshold current at @xmath1 , analogous to the coulomb blockade voltage of a tunnel junction , and explains the observed thickness dependence of critical currents in hts coated conductors . </S>",
    "<S> we use the schrdinger equation to compute the evolving macrostate amplitudes , coupled by a generalized tunneling matrix element . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations yield excellent quantitative agreement with measured voltage - current characteristics of bi - crystal and other hts grain boundary junctions . </S>",
    "<S> the model also predicts non - sinusoidal behavior in the voltage oscillations resulting from time - correlated vortex tunneling . </S>"
