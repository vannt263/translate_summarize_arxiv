    "the study of rare gas and metal clusters interacting with intense infrared , optical , and ultraviolet laser pulses has emerged as a new promising research area in strong field physics ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the generation of fast electrons and ions , the production of high charge states , the generation of x - rays and nuclear fusion ( in the case of deuterium - enriched clusters ) was observed using cluster targets in strong laser fields of intensities up to @xmath0w/@xmath1 .",
    "hot and dense nonuniform , nonequilibrium and nonstationary plasmas produced under such conditions and confined on a femto- or picosecond time scale to nanometer sizes  so - called _",
    "nanoplasmas_are new physical objects with unusual properties .",
    "one of the most important features of nanoplasmas is the very efficient energy transfer from light to charged particles , which is much higher ( per particle ) than for an atomic gas of the same average density @xcite . although the particular mechanisms responsible for the laser energy deposition in clusters still remain debated @xcite , the pivotal role of collective plasma dynamics ( in particular the excitation of surface plasmons ) and of nonlinear resonance ( a definition is given below in sec .",
    "[ reoloh ] ) in the energy transfer from laser light to the electrons in the nanoplasma and the subsequent outer ionization was proved in experiments , simulations , and simple analytical models @xcite .",
    "while the energy absorption from intense laser pulses by nanoplasmas has been widely studied both in experiments and theory , much less attention has been paid to harmonic emission from such systems .",
    "naturally the question arises whether laser - driven clusters , being highly nonlinear systems , may be a source of high - order harmonics as efficient as atoms in the gas phase ( or even more efficient ? ) .",
    "there are at least two essentially different physical mechanisms which could be responsible for emission of harmonics from such a system .",
    "first , the mechanism based on recombination of the virtually ionized electron with its parent ion @xcite , well - studied in gaseous atomic targets , may also work in clusters where it can be modified by the fact that the atoms are closer to each other , so that the electron s motion between ionization and recombination can be distorted by the field of the other ions .",
    "moreover , the electron may recombine with an ion different from its parent .",
    "this leads to modifications in the single - electron dynamics and in the phase matching conditions while the physical origin of harmonic generation ( hg ) remains the same as in a gas jet .",
    "modifications of the atomic recombination mechanism in clusters have been considered in @xcite .",
    "however , in high intensity fields where each atom is loosing one or several electrons already during the leading edge of the laser pulse the recombination mechanism can hardly be efficient .",
    "second , as dense electron plasmas is produced inside a cluster , its coherent motion may be an efficient source of radiation . in a collisionless plasma , as it is generated by intense laser fields inside small clusters , individual electron - electron and electron - ion collisions can not destroy the coherency of the collective electron motion .",
    "this coherent , collective electron motion may cause hg if it is nonlinear . recently , several experiments on high harmonic emission from plasma surfaces illuminated by short laser pulses of intensity @xmath2w/@xmath1 and higher were reported ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the physical picture which is behind such _ plasma harmonics _ appears to be more complicated and diverse than the recombination mechanism in atomic hg .    in macroplasmas",
    "the magnetic component of the lorentz force is a typical source of nonlinearity . in this case",
    "the nonlinearity parameter is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the typical velocity related to collective oscillations of the electron plasma and @xmath5 is the speed of light . as a consequence , generation of harmonics from dense macroplsmas may require relativistic intensities @xcite .",
    "as compared to macroplasmas , clusters introduce an extra source of nonlinearity due to their small spacial size , namely @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the cluster radius and @xmath8 is the amplitude with which the electron cloud oscillates under the action of the laser field @xcite .",
    "therefore , one could expect strongly nonlinear electron motion even in the nonrelativistic regime .",
    "it should be noted , however , that although individual collisions may not be important , there are other effects which can spoil the coherency required for efficient radiation . most of these undesirable effects can be attributed to dynamical instabilities induced by the interaction of particles with the mean self - consistent field ( in the presence of the laser field ) .",
    "therefore , the examination of _ plasma harmonics _ usually requires not only the analysis of the collective motion but that of individual electron trajectories as well .    up to now only a few experiments on hg from clusters",
    "are known . in refs .",
    "@xcite hg from rare - gas clusters irradiated by infrared pulses of moderate ( @xmath9w/@xmath1 ) intensity was studied .",
    "it was shown that under such conditions harmonics can be generated up to higher orders and with a higher saturation intensity than in a gas jet .",
    "in addition other interesting properties including different power laws in the intensity - dependent harmonic yield for particular harmonics for clusters and atoms were reported @xcite . however , in refs .",
    "@xcite the applied intensities were rather low to create a dense nanoplasma inside clusters and the main features of the recorded spectra ( like a plateau followed by a cutoff ) were found to be quite similar to the case of a gaseous target .",
    "this allows to attribute the observed effects to hg along the standard atomic recombination mechanism as described above .",
    "recently the experimental observation of the third harmonic ( th ) generation from argon clusters in a strong laser field was reported @xcite .",
    "the laser intensity was varied between @xmath10 and @xmath11w/@xmath1 and was thus sufficiently high for the creation of a dense nanoplasma . at such intensities hg along the atomic recombination mechanism relevant in gases",
    "is essentially suppressed because of saturated single - electron ionization so that the observed th signal can be fully attributed to the nonlinearity of the laser - driven nanoplasma . a resonant enhancement of the th yield ( when the mie frequency of the expanding cluster approaches three times the laser frequency ) has been measured using a pump - probe setup",
    ". the th enhancement of the single - cluster response , as studied in theory before @xcite , is , however , masked in the experiment by phase matching effects whose optimization at high average atomic density necessary to create clusters has been shown to be more intricate than for rare gas jets .",
    "the latter complication makes an experimental study of nanoplasma radiation a difficult task while in computations it can be simplified by first examining the single - cluster response and , second , analyzing propagation effects .    in the recent paper @xcite , we considered the radiation emitted by a single cluster exposed to a strong laser pulse .",
    "we computed harmonic spectra from argon clusters in short 800-nm pulses of intensity @xmath12w/@xmath1 using a 3d particle - in - cell ( pic ) code ( applied before to the study of collisionless energy absorption in laser - driven nanoplasmas @xcite ) .",
    "the most intriguing outcome of our study was the absence of high - order harmonics in the computed spectra , even at high intensities for all cluster sizes we considered .",
    "we attributed this effect to the above - mentioned dynamical instability in motion of individual electrons .    in this paper",
    "we introduce two analytical models which describe the collective and single - electron dynamics of a laser - driven nanoplasma , respectively , and apply them for the explanation of both the numerical results @xcite and the data @xcite .",
    "we show that the numerical results can be well described and understood within the rigid sphere model ( rsm ) but only for low harmonic orders @xmath13 while for higher harmonics the rsm yields qualitatively wrong predictions . using a simple 1d model we describe a stochastic , resonant single - particle electron dynamics which suppresses the emission of high harmonics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ softpapr ] we formulate the statement of the problem and describe the numerical method and the pic results . in sec .",
    "[ reoloh ] the spectra extracted from the pic simulations are compared with the predictions of the rsm . in sec .",
    "[ sohhvsboie ] we introduce a model for the description of the single - electron dynamics and radiation and use it to explain the suppression of the high harmonic yield .",
    "the last section contains the conclusions .",
    "a cluster is converted into a dense electron plasma almost promptly if the laser pulse is intense enough to ionize the cluster constituents .",
    "we refer to this process as inner ionization which should not be confused with outer ionization , when the nanoplasma electrons leave the cluster .",
    "several competitive processes govern the evolution of this plasma during the interaction with the pulse and later , until the cluster becomes dissolved due to coulomb explosion or hydrodynamic expansion . the electron density increases because of further ionization of atoms and ions by the local electric field which may differ essentially from the applied laser field . with increasing plasma density due to inner ionization ,",
    "the oscillating electric field of an infrared laser is screened , so that its amplitude inside the cluster may be a few times or even an order of magnitude less than the amplitude of the incident wave ( see more explanations on screening in sec .",
    "[ sohhvsboie ] below eq.([e0 ] ) ) . simultaneously , as soon as a sizeable fraction of electrons have left the cluster , a quasistatic space charge field is built up which may become strong enough to induce further inner ionization ( `` ionization ignition '' , @xcite ) . on the other hand , both outer ionization and the expansion of the cluster reduce the electron density .",
    "the net result of this competition is very sensitive to all parameters , including laser intensity , pulse duration , cluster size and type of atoms .",
    "however , for the vast majority of parameters a significant part of the electrons remains confined within the expanding ionic core . during this stage of the cluster evolution until the laser pulse is off the nonlinear motion of the laser - driven nanoplasma may cause emission of laser harmonics .",
    "we have observed the above described scenario in pic simulations of laser - cluster interaction , as reported in @xcite .",
    "the dynamics and the radiation of nanoplasmas was studied for @xmath14 clusters ( with the number of atoms @xmath15@xmath16 and radii @xmath17@xmath18 nm ) , irradiated by linearly polarized , 8-cycle sin@xmath19-laser pulses with an electric field @xmath20 and the wavelength @xmath21  nm . here",
    "@xmath22 is the carrier frequency and @xmath23 is the number of optical cycles in the pulse .",
    "the contribution of electrons remaining bound in atoms ( ions ) during the interaction was not taken into account .",
    "results were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite where also more details about the numerical simulation may be found .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to briefly summarize the main results :    * the relative yields of low order harmonics depend on the laser intensity and the cluster size . *",
    "the time - frequency analysis of harmonic spectra shows that low order harmonic enhancements occur when multiples of the laser frequency resonate with the transient mie frequency . * even for the very high intensity @xmath24w/@xmath1 no distinguishable high harmonics ( higher than the 7th ) appear in the spectra ( see fig .  1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . * only a part of the nanoplasma deeply bound inside the ion core contributes to ( low order ) harmonic generation .",
    "the enhancements of particular low - order harmonics predicted in @xcite have been later studied numerically for small clusters using molecular dynamics simulations @xcite and were finally observed in the experiment for the case of the third harmonic @xcite .",
    "it is well established now that the physical origin of enhancements is the resonance between the harmonic frequency and the mie frequency of the expanding nanoplasma .",
    "the time - frequency analysis of the radiation as calculated from the pic results for the total acceleration further confirmed this statement @xcite .",
    "typical tf diagrams , showing which frequencies are emitted when , are reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the same plots we show the scaled time - dependent effective mie frequency @xmath25 .",
    "the standard definition of the mie frequency @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the average ion charge and @xmath28 is the atom density , is only appropriate for the case of an almost homogeneous charge distribution ( in this section atomic units @xmath29 are used ) .",
    "however , because of the ignition effect and the cluster expansion the average ion charge @xmath27 depends on the ion position . as we found in @xcite , the low - order harmonics are emitted mainly by electrons confined within the ion core and with excursion amplitudes comparable to the initial cluster radius @xmath7 or less . in the following",
    "we will refer to these electrons as the _ deeply bound _",
    "electrons , and we define the effective mie frequency as @xmath30 with @xmath31 the total ionic charge inside the sphere of radius @xmath7 within which the cloud of deeply bound electrons oscillates",

    "panel ( c ) shows the tf diagram for an @xmath33 cluster at the intensity @xmath24w/@xmath1 .",
    "the scaled time - dependent mie frequency @xmath25 is included in all plots ( solid lines ) .",
    "[ fig1],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    it is clearly seen from the tf diagrams of fig.[fig1 ] that the enhancements of the third and fifth harmonic must be attributed to the respective high - order nonlinear resonances between the laser frequency and the mie frequency , @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 ) . here",
    "we call the resonance _ nonlinear _ since it appears in a _ nonlinear _ system .",
    "this nonlinearity ( i.e. , anharmonicity in the effective potential of electron - ion interaction ) is a necessary condition for the emission of harmonics .",
    "the physical origin of this nonlinearity may be either the electrons jutting out of the core during their motion , thus sensing the coulomb tail @xcite , or the inhomogeneous charge distribution within the ion core @xcite .",
    "note that the appearance of a significant signal at frequencies different from odd multiples of the laser frequency ( namely , the second harmonic in fig.[fig1](a ) and the forth harmonic in fig.[fig1](c ) ) should be attributed to the excitation of eigenoscillations of the electron cloud with the time - dependent eigenfrequency @xmath36 .",
    "these oscillations are of significance only in short pulses , as used in the pic simulations .    the results of the tf analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite not only explain , at least qualitatively , the resonant enhancement of the th observed in @xcite but also confirm the idea formulated there that with a proper adjustment of parameters harmonics of higher order ( 5th , maybe 7th ) could also be resonantly enhanced .",
    "it was shown in earlier studies @xcite that the resonant enhancements of low - order harmonics may be reasonably described using a very simple rigid sphere model ( rsm ) . here",
    "we show that , while for low - order harmonics the rsm works well , it fails even qualitatively to reproduce the high - energy part of the spectrum . in a rsm",

    "the spread of the electron cloud beyond the ion core reduces the eigenfrequency .",

    "the eigenfrequency of the electron cloud @xmath76 depends upon the amplitude of the oscillations ( the maximum value @xmath77=\\sqrt{a_1}\\omega_{\\rm mie}$ ] corresponds to small harmonic oscillations ) and , therefore , upon the laser intensity . as a result , at fixed cluster parameters the resonant enhancements appear at certain values of the intensity . for the spectra of fig.[fig2](a ,",
    "d ) and ( c , f ) the parameters were chosen such that the maximum value of the eigenfrequency exceeds the integers 3 and 5 , respectively , so that , with increasing intensity resonant enhancements of the third and the fifth harmonic appear .",
    "these enhancements are clearly seen from the comparison of these spectra with the ones calculated for the case shown in fig.[fig2](b , e ) when the maximum eigenfrequency @xmath77\\approx 4.4 $ ] is far from both resonances . in panels",
    "( a - c ) the intensities are chosen such that the sphere s oscillation amplitudes are almost the same in each case so that the relative difference in the strength of the third and the fifth harmonic ( about three orders in magnitude ) shows the efficiency of the resonant enhancement .",
    "for the higher intensities in panels ( d - f ) these enhancements are even more pronounced .",
    "a comparison between the rsm and the pic results shows that for the low - order harmonics the rsm provides a qualitatively correct description of the spectrum , including the effect of resonant enhancement .",
    "this gives an additional justification of the rsm for applications to laser - driven nanoplasmas .",
    "however , for relatively high harmonics ( ninth or higher ) the results predicted by the rsm appear to be qualitatively wrong . indeed , the rsm predicts the appearance of higher harmonics with increasing laser intensity , as it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2](f ) where the spectrum ends up at the 13-th harmonic . by a moderate variation of the parameters inherent to the model , namely @xmath78 and @xmath69",

    "as expected for a classical system , no signature of a plateau emerges in the spectra .",
    "however , the pic simulations reported in @xcite do not show any harmonics above the seventh within the studied domain of parameters , including the very high intensity of @xmath24w/@xmath1 .",
    "the same effect was found in @xcite where no harmonics above the ninth have been observed for intensities up to @xmath2w/@xmath1 . in ref.@xcite",
    "we concluded from the inspection of individual pic electron s trajectories that a dynamical instability induced by the resonant interaction of electrons with the time - dependent self - consistent field is responsible for the suppression of high harmonics .",
    "obviously , such a mechanism is beyond the rsm since the latter accounts for collective electron dynamics only . in the next section",
    "we introduce a single - particle model suited for the analysis of the motion and the radiation of individual electrons so that the instability responsible for the suppression of high harmonics from cluster nanoplasmas under the above - described conditions can be studied .",
    "it is known from numerical studies ( see examples in @xcite ) that in a laser - driven cluster the electron population separates into a dense core with a radius comparable to the initial cluster radius @xmath7 and a rarefied halo with a typical size of several @xmath7 .",
    "this subdivision is equivalent to a separation of quasifree electrons into deeply and weakly bound electrons , correspondingly .",
    "a decrease of the electron density due to outer ionization is compensated by the inner ionization of atoms , provided inner ionization is not yet depleted , so that the cycle - averaged electron density distributions both in the core and the halo evolve rather slowly in time .",
    "the core oscillates with relatively small deformations so that the rsm seems to be applicable to the deeply bound electron s dynamics while electron trajectories in the halo are strongly disturbed by the laser field and can not be captured by the rsm .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the radiation of individual pic electrons has been considered ( see fig .  3 there ) .",
    "it was shown that electrons radiate harmonics as long as they move inside the dense core .",
    "being liberated from the core , electrons leave the cluster vicinity almost promptly , usually within a laser period .",
    "this means , that the halo contains basically no permanent population , but consists almost entirely of electrons on their way out of the cluster .",
    "hence the electron density in the halo determines the rate of outer ionization from the cluster . during the ejection",
    ", each electron emits an intense flash of radiation with an almost continuous spectrum that extends up to significantly higher frequencies than present in the net harmonic spectrum . in ref.@xcite",
    "we argued that these flashes add up incoherently in the total emission amplitude .",
    "here we introduce a simple analytical 1d model which helps to illuminate the physical origin of this incoherency . despite its simplicity our model is able to describe , at least qualitatively , all essential features seen in the simulations .",
    "let us suppose frozen ions and the number of nanoplasma electrons fixed so that in the absence of the laser field each electron moves in the time - independent self - consistent potential @xmath79 .",
    "the laser field excites oscillations of the electron cloud which induce the ac part of the space charge field @xmath80 .",
    "the net oscillating field inside the system can be written as ( t)=e_l(t)+e^(i)_sc(t)_0f(t)(_l t+ ) , [ field ] where @xmath81 is the time - dependent pulse envelope . if the mie frequency notably exceeds the laser frequency , @xmath82 , as it is the case for infrared lasers , the laser field and the ac space - charge field @xmath80 essentially compensate each other . in this case",
    "the amplitude of the net oscillating field inside the cluster @xmath83 is related to the amplitude of the laser field @xmath84 according _ 0e_0 .",

    "we should also take into account the interaction between the electron under consideration and all other electrons in the cloud . within the model",
    "we assume that the electron cloud undergoes small , slightly nonlinear oscillations , so that this extra force is almost homogeneous inside the cluster and oscillates in time with the frequency @xmath22 . within the rsm and under the condition @xmath85 we assume throughout the paper that the electron cloud displacement @xmath86 reads @xmath87 calculating the electric field induced inside the cluster due to this displacement and summing it up with the laser field ( [ field ] ) one obtains the estimate ( [ e0 ] ) for the amplitude of the net oscillating field . this type of screening results from the coherent superposition of the applied and the self - consistent field and has nothing in common with damping of electromagnetic waves in macroplasmas .",
    "the latter occurrs on the spatial scale of the skin - depth , which is in general much bigger than the typical cluster size we consider .",

    "as soon as the separatrices of neighboring resonances intersect , the particle , captured by the first resonance , may jump to the third , etc .",
    "because the volume of the accessible phase space is increasing with energy this inter - resonance motion will have a predominant direction , namely towards higher energies .",
    "this leads to a fast liberation of the electron from the system , known as _",
    "stochastic ionization _ @xcite . for realistic parameters of laser - cluster interaction",
    "this overlap of resonances is realized with almost 100% probability so that cases where the particle remains trapped by a resonance are rare while almost prompt ionization occurs as soon as the first - order resonance is reached .    we visualize the above - described scenario by solving eq.([ne ] ) numerically . in the calculation",
    "we take @xmath120 and @xmath121 so that even the amplitude @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) still corresponds to the weak - field regime , as defined above .",
    "these parameters are not arbitrarily chosen .",
    "indeed , a solution of eq.([ne ] ) with the well ( [ c ] ) and the field ( [ field ] ) with a slowly varying envelope depends on four dimensionless parameters , @xmath119 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , the two last of them defining the initial conditions . to recalculate all the parameters for a real system",
    "we should assume some certain values for the cluster radius and the laser field frequency , which then define all other parameters .",
    "for typical values , say @xmath127 nm and @xmath128ev , and for the dimensionless parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] one may check that the resulting strengths of the quasistatic and the oscillating parts of the self - consistent field indeed correspond to the estimates given below eq.([e0 ] ) .",
    "the positions of the most important first and third - order resonances are @xmath129 and @xmath130 , respectively .",
    "a particle with the initial energy @xmath131 starts its motion at @xmath132 and @xmath133 when the field @xmath134 is negligibly small .",
    "then the field ( with a gaussian envelope ) increases , and the electron propagation under the action of the full force is calculated until @xmath135 . by choosing different phases @xmath126 of the field we model different initial conditions for the particle at the fixed initial energy @xmath136 .",
    "the results are summarized in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig5]a corresponds to the `` perturbative '' regime of interaction .",
    "the initial energy is far enough from the first ( lower ) resonance , so that the trajectory in the energy space does not intersect the respective lower separatrix , or just touches it . as a result ,",
    "the trajectory remains weakly disturbed , its shape is well described as a superposition of oscillations with the frequencies @xmath137 and @xmath22 . by choosing different initial conditions we obtain trajectories simply shifted in time by the value of @xmath126 .",
    "figures  [ fig5](b , c ) correspond to the `` resonant '' regime of interaction where the initial energy is high enough or the field is strong enough to cause penetration of the particle into the vicinity of the first resonance .",
    "the five trajectories plotted in figs.[fig5](b , c ) show that the near - resonant motion is very sensitive both to the initial conditions and to the field amplitude so that a particular trajectory appears to be unpredictable .",
    "usually the particle is emitted from the system while in rare cases it remains in a bound state after the pulse is off , being trapped by a resonance ( see the trajectories in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b , c ) ) . from this observations",
    "we may conclude that at parameters typical for intense laser - nanoplasma interactions the particle behavior in the `` resonant '' regime becomes stochastic , as it is expected to be according to the general theory @xcite .    in classical ionization , a particle has to overcome the potential barrier , i.e. , its total energy must exceed the maximum value of the potential energy suppressed by the field at some time instant .",
    "obviously , the trajectories of fig .",
    "[ fig5](b , c ) satisfy this condition , while both trajectories of fig .",
    "[ fig5]a do not . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the trajectories in energy space evaluated for half the laser frequency , @xmath138 , and all other parameters the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b .",
    "the plots show that with decreasing laser frequency the time - dependent energy gain from the field to the particle decreases down to a perturbative level , the total energy remains always below the maximum of the time - dependent potential energy , and no ionization or excitation occurs . within the resonant picture",
    "we exploit here the qualitative difference between the trajectories of figs .",
    "[ fig5](b , c ) and [ fig6 ] appears because with decreasing frequency the first resonant level is shifted up and no penetration into the resonant area between the separatrices takes place anymore .",
    "it is instructive to show the connection between the single - electron model specified by eqs .",
    "( [ field]),([h]),([ne]),([c ] ) and a model which describes collective motion , as the rsm of sec .",
    "[ reoloh ] does .",
    "the rsm deals with the electron cloud displacement @xmath86 whose fourier - transform is directly related to the spectrum .",
    "this value can also be calculated within a single - electron picture as * x*(t)=d_0d  * r*(_0,,t)f(_0 , ) , [ xt ] where @xmath139 is the individual trajectory with the initial energy @xmath136 and the initial condition @xmath126 , and @xmath140 is the distribution function for electrons before the field is on .",
    "one should note that , contrary to the rsm , the spatial distribution of the electrons in the presence of the field is not known unless one calculates all individual trajectories . calculating a trajectory",
    "@xmath139 analytically is possible only within perturbation theory with respect to the external field where one may easily derive ( [ ne0 ] ) with the linear part of the restoring force only from ( [ xt ] ) .",
    "the derivation of nonlinear corrections , although doable , requires very cumbersome algebra .",
    "the single - particle model is appropriate for a qualitative description of the stochastic resonant behavior but hardly applicable to the study of the slightly unharmonic motion of the deeply bound electrons .",
    "the analysis of the previous subsection gives a direct explanation of the radiation spectra extracted from the pic results in ref .",
    "@xcite both for individual electrons and for whole clusters .",
    "deeply bound electrons with energies below the first resonant separatrix @xmath141 move along slightly perturbed regular trajectories .",
    "this causes hg with rapidly decreasing yield as a function of the harmonic order so that even the seventh harmonic is barely present in the corresponding spectrum of fig .",
    "an individual electron , while passing the resonance and being trapped by it or leaving the cluster potential , emits radiation due to its strong acceleration , seen as a flash in the tf spectrograms of fig .",
    "[ fig7]b , c .",
    "these spectrograms should be compared with the ones extracted from our pic results ( see fig.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "exactly because of the stochastic nature of nonlinear resonance the electrons trajectories are very sensitive to the initial conditions with which the nonlinear resonance is entered , as is clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig5]c where solid black , dashed black and gray trajectories correspond to the same initial energy and the same field amplitude but different phases of the external field . as a result , flashes from different electrons are incoherent ( the corresponding amplitudes have nearly random phases ) , and , being added up , vanish in the total dipole acceleration .",
    "a and both curves of fig .",
    "[ fig5]b ) electron trajectories.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    this shows that exactly the same mechanism behind efficient energy absorption by and outer ionization from clusters , namely nonlinear resonance @xcite , restricts hg from them by breaking the coherent electron motion once it becomes strongly anharmonic .",
    "only well - bound electrons trapped inside the ionic core with energies far from the resonance contribute to the net , coherent radiation of the cluster .",
    "a similar behavior was observed in classical ensemble simulations of atomic hg @xcite .",
    "instabilities induced by the resonant interaction grow in time ( usually with an exponential rate ) .",
    "thus the picture depends also on the pulse duration . with all other parameters fixed , for longer pulses , more and more trajectories from the vicinity of the separatrix experience a stochastic behavior . as a consequence ,",
    "an increase of the pulse duration should lead , in general , to a further loss of coherency .",
    "although laser - irradiated cluster nanoplasmas emit low - order harmonics efficiently , no significant yield of high harmonics can be expected even for very high laser intensities .",
    "this is a consequence of dynamical stochasticity , inherent to nonlinear dynamical systems driven by weak , time - dependent forces such as the screened electric field inside a cluster .",
    "increasing the laser intensity does not help much because the self - consistent field trapping the electrons inside the ion core increases too . as a consequence the electron population always splits into deeply bound electrons and a halo , the mie - frequency and the screening increases , so that the physical picture remains almost insensitive to the intensity of the applied field .",
    "another option we did not consider above is to use relatively long pulses where the first - order resonance with the mie frequency can be reached because of the ion core expansion .",
    "if the mie resonance is met the ac electric field inside the cluster is grossly enhanced and nearly all electron trajectories appear to be strongly disturbed . in this case an analysis of near - resonant stochastic behavior as given above is inappropriate .",
    "it seems that a direct numerical study is the only option under these conditions .",
