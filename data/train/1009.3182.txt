    "the statistical properties of galaxy clusters provide independent cosmological information , complementary to that inferred from other observations such as measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , supernova type ia ( sn ia ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and weak lensing ( wl ) data .",
    "clusters are the largest virialized objects ( dark matter halos ) in the universe , with mass scales corresponding to overdensities that enter the non - linear phase of gravitational collapse between redshifts @xmath3 .",
    "consequently , their abundance and spatial distribution can potentially probe both the cosmic expansion history as well as the growth of cosmic structures .",
    "theoretical considerations such as the prediction of the halo mass function based on semi - analytical approaches @xcite and n - body simulations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have suggested that cluster statistics is particularly sensitive to the normalization of the matter power spectrum @xmath4 ( the root - mean - square of linear fluctuations within a sphere of @xmath5 mpc radius ) and the total cosmic matter density @xmath6 .",
    "these observational aspects have given a strong incentive to the use of clusters as cosmic probes .",
    "over the past decades cluster observations have greatly evolved . after the pioneering studies of the einstein medium sensitivity survey @xcite , the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) and deep rosat pointed observations have provided an invaluable reservoir of clusters out to redshift @xmath7 .",
    "these measurements enabled the first determinations of @xmath8 and @xmath6 based on cluster number counts alone ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and in combination with measurements of the local correlation function from rass @xcite .",
    "similarly the sloan digital sky survey cluster catalogue offered the first determination using an optical dataset ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "quite remarkably these measurements have always consistently pointed out to a low matter density universe , in agreement with results from galaxy survey data @xcite and cmb observations @xcite . with the launch of xmm and chandra",
    "a decade ago , a new era has begun : deep pointed observations of large cluster samples , mainly extracted from the rosat catalogues , have provided detailed insights into the baryonic physics of clusters and their morphology .",
    "this has resulted in a tremendous burst in the modeling of the cluster properties as well as in the determination of their mass .",
    "these advancements have led to improved constraints on @xmath8 and @xmath6 , as obtained for example using the temperature function of local bright clusters @xcite . from the point of view of large area surveys ,",
    "the xmm - lss survey @xcite covering some 11 deg@xmath0  performed pioneering cluster detection work , assembling a complete sample of xmm clusters at a sensitivity of @xmath9  in the [ 0.5 - 2 ] kev band . moreover , it provided detailed insights about the impact of selection effects on cluster evolutionary studies @xcite .",
    "the discovery of dark energy has generated a revived interest in the use of cluster statistics as an alternative test for probing the nature of this exotic component .",
    "dark energy can directly affect the cluster number counts by modifying the growth rate of structures as well as the size of the cosmological volume probed at a given redshift @xcite .",
    "several works have attempted to measure the dark energy equation of state using cluster data in combination with other probes @xcite .",
    "however statistical and systematic uncertainties , as well as the presence of degeneracy between cosmological parameters , remain the major limitations to accurately test dark energy with current data .    from an observational point of view ,",
    "the main quantities that are useful to constrain cosmology are : the redshift evolution of the cluster number counts ( @xmath10 ) or ideally the evolution of the cluster mass function ( @xmath11 ) , the spatial distribution of clusters ( e.g. the two - point correlation function , @xmath12 ) , the cluster temperature function , the gas mass fraction in clusters as well as various scaling laws describing the evolution of cluster structural properties .",
    "there are two key practical issues that such studies have to face : firstly the ability to assemble well characterized cluster samples , and secondly the need for well understood mass - observable relations , since for a given cosmology the cluster mass is the only independent variable entering the theory .",
    "mass estimates can be inferred from a variety of methods : optical richness , galaxy velocity dispersion , x - ray luminosity or temperature , s - z decrement , weak lensing signal or from more elaborated proxies such as @xmath13 described in @xcite ; if x - ray temperature and gas density profiles are available , masses can be calculated under the hypothesis of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "depending on the number of cosmological parameters that one aims at constraining and the required accuracy , the minimum size of useful cluster samples ranges from 50 - 100 objects for constraining @xmath8 and @xmath6 only , to several hundreds or even several thousands ( if little information is available on masses ) for constraining the dark energy parameters .    since clusters constrain regions of the cosmological parameter space which are complementary to that probed by other tests such as sn ia , cmb , bao and wl data ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , considerable efforts have been devoted , both theoretically and observationally , to characterize the use of clusters in the near future .",
    "forecasts of the dark energy parameter uncertainties from future optical , x - ray and s - z surveys have been the subject of several analyses @xcite .",
    "these studies , generally focusing on surveys covering a few 1 000 deg@xmath0 , have shown that precision cosmology in the context of cluster surveys is certainly possible in the near future .",
    "subsequently , there has been a growing interest in evaluating the impact of systematic uncertainties of such cluster surveys .",
    "for instance , one can mention the sensitivity of the dark energy constraints to halo modeling uncertainties @xcite or to the mass accuracy of given cluster sub - samples ; the latter is of special relevance when designing the follow - up observations to increase the cluster mass accuracy : given that telescope time is limited , it is necessary to optimise the targeting of specific mass and redshift ranges @xcite .",
    "while these prospective dark energy studies pertain to upcoming or future instrumentation , we examine here the potential of xmm , whose characteristics and capabilities are now very well established .",
    "in fact , with its outstanding collecting area ( @xmath14 on axis at 1 kev ) , wide spectral range ( [ 0.1 - 10 ] kev ) , good spatial ( @xmath15 arcsec on axis ) and spectral ( 5 - 10% at 1 kev ) resolution , xmm appears to be the best suited , currently available , x - ray observatory to undertake a large cluster survey . as an example , with 10 ks exposures , xmm reaches a sensitivity which is about 1000 times greater than rass , i.e. @xmath16 in [ 0.5 - 2 ] kev for point sources . basically , xmm has the power to unambiguously resolve any cluster , to be compared to the xmm on - axis psf of 6 arcsec ] provided that at least some @xmath17 photons are collected .    in this paper",
    ", we forecast the dark energy parameter errors for an xmm cluster survey with an area of the order of 100 deg@xmath0 . using results from accurate survey simulations and precise model predictions",
    ", we estimate the dark energy parameter errors for different survey configurations .",
    "we find that the expected parameter constraints are not only complementary to those of other cosmological probes , but competitive with respect to forecasted errors for the next generation of dark energy dedicated experiments .    compared with other cluster surveys ,",
    "x - ray observations have an indisputable advantage , since cluster x - ray properties can be predicted _ ab initio _ for a given cosmological model , with _ observational input _ ( e.g. , mass - observable relations ) being easily implementable .",
    "in contrast , ground - based large optical cluster surveys ( e.g. , sdss max bcg catalogue , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though may appear much more attractive because of their lower cost , still require _ ad hoc _ prescriptions to evaluate the cluster selection function with cosmological numerical simulations .",
    "such procedures usually rely on the optical richness as defined by the galaxy distribution .",
    "we want to stress that computing a cluster survey selection function in the era of precision cosmology requires a self - consistent modeling of the selection function itself .",
    "we will show here that this plays a critical role in the interpretation of the cluster number counts .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that , after 40 years of experience , x - ray cluster surveys are still much ahead of s - z surveys both in terms of detection rates and for the evaluation of the selection function . in the following",
    "we shall refer to the discussed survey as the xxl survey . + the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ clustobs ]",
    "we introduce the basic equations for the cluster survey observables , namely the cluster number counts and the @xmath1-point correlation function . in section  [ xxlsurvey ]",
    "we describe the survey configurations and selection functions , while in section  [ surveyerr ] using numerical simulations we estimate the expected experimental survey uncertainties . in section  [ fisher - analysis ] we describe the fisher matrix calculation performed to infer the expected cosmological parameter constraints , and discuss the results in section  [ constraints ] .",
    "finally we present our summary and conclusions in section  [ conclusion ] . throughout the paper , we consider the @xmath18cdm cosmology with the parameters determined by wmap-5 @xcite as our fiducial cosmological model .",
    "the number of clusters as function of redshift is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the survey solid angle , @xmath21 is the cosmological volume factor , @xmath22 is the redshift dependent survey selection function and @xmath23 is the comoving density of halos of mass @xmath24 .",
    "the volume factor in a friedmann - robertson - walker space - time reads as @xmath25 with @xmath26 the speed of light , @xmath27 the hubble constant today , and @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the present matter , radiation , dark energy , and curvature densities , in units of the critical density respectively , and @xmath30 is the angular diameter distance .",
    "the function @xmath31 depends on the model of dark energy .",
    "we consider three scenarios : 1 ) cosmological constant @xmath18 , with @xmath32 ; 2 ) dark energy fluid characterized by a constant equation of state @xmath33 for which @xmath34 ; 3 ) time evolving dark energy equation of state parametrized in the form @xmath35 @xcite for which @xmath36}$ ] .",
    "cluster de studies make various assumptions as to the selection function .",
    "it can be defined by a simple mass limit , depending or not on redshift and cosmology ; the limit is supposed to be step - like or to allow for a possible dispersion and for some smooth function across the threshold ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for an x - ray survey , @xmath37 is determined using a mass - observable relation , for instance the mass - luminosity relation .",
    "because of this , the limiting mass depends on empirically determined parameters ( parametrizing the physics of the hot gas in clusters ) , and the luminosity distance , i.e. on the underlying cosmological model .",
    "this is an important point , since it implies that to properly infer cosmological constraints from cluster data one must take into account the cosmological dependence of the mass threshold @xmath37 .",
    "another relevant aspect concerns the fact that survey design , instrumental characteristics and imaging technique analysis , cause the cluster selection function not to behave as a step function .",
    "this can affect the predicted number counts and 2-point correlation statistics for a given cosmological model .",
    "the effect of a non step - like function has been studied in the literature for s - z surveys @xcite and x - ray surveys @xcite .",
    "here we use realistic selection functions derived from accurate simulations of the xmm - lss survey that will be discussed in section  [ xxlsurvey ] .",

    "our fixed value of @xmath63 is only exact for an einstein - de sitter universe - although it hardly varies with the cosmology .",
    "nevertheless , we preferred to follow the convention of @xcite and fix it .",
    "cluster surveys are , similarly to galaxy surveys , defined by a number of parameters such as sky coverage and geometry , depth , selection function , and redshift accuracy . on the other hand , compared to galaxies , clusters are rare objects , a characteristic that has a significant impact on the determination of the correlation function . moreover ,",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , cluster mass accuracy plays an important role in the determination of the cosmological parameters . in this section",
    ", we present the generic characteristics of the xxl survey , while a quantitative examination of the various sources of uncertainty will be presented in section  [ surveyerr ] .      in this case study",
    ", we examine the merits of two possible xmm survey concepts : _ survey - a _ covers a total sky area of 50 deg@xmath0  with 40 ks xmm pointings , this configuration is assumed to allow mass measurements at the 10 - 50% level for the selected cluster samples ; _ survey - b _ covers 200 deg@xmath0  with 10 ks xmm pointings and provides a cluster mass accuracy of 50 - 80% .",

    "we need to specify how the two basic observable quantities , the x - ray count rate in a given band and the apparent size of the cluster sources , relate to the cluster mass as a function of redshift .",
    "+ in the following , we assume the usual [ 0.5 - 2 ] kev range as the working detection band , since it presents the optimal s / n , given the cluster spectra , the background spectrum and the xmm spectral response @xcite . furthermore we assume the observed cluster scaling laws between luminosity ( @xmath65 ) , temperature ( @xmath66 ) and the mass within a radius containing an overdensity of 200 times the critical density ( @xmath67 ) as determined in the local universe @xcite , and use the self - similar prescription for their evolution . to account for",

    ", we use @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the slope of their @xmath70 relation . to assign the x - ray luminosity we assume a log - normal distribution .",
    "these prescriptions allow us to compute the flux , and finally the count rate as function of the cluster mass and redshift .",
    "the impact of these hypotheses will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ constraints ] and [ conclusion ] .",
    "fluxes are estimated using the apec thermal plasma model , assuming a fixed hydrogen column density of @xmath74  @xmath75 and setting the heavy element abundance to 0.3 solar .",
    "fluxes are subsequently folded with the telescope and detector response ( epic response matrices ) assuming the thin optical blocking filter .",
    "this allows us to predict the observed count - rates .",
    "we further assume a @xmath76-profile for the gas distribution , with @xmath76=2/3 and a constant physical core radius of @xmath77  kpc , unless otherwise specified .",
    "this finally yields the spatial distribution of the cluster counts on the detectors .",
    "we now turn to the description of the selection function .",
    "the ability to select clusters upon well - defined x - ray criteria is a key issue : as shown in section  [ clustobs ] , the selection function directly enters into the modeling of the cluster number counts and spatial correlation function .",
    "+ in this prospective study , we adopt the c1/c2 selection functions specifically determined for the xmm - lss survey .",
    "these have been extensively tested on the basis of xmm image simulations @xcite and applied to the xmm - lss sample @xcite .",
    "the selection basically operates in the _ [ extent , extent likelihood ] _ x - ray pipeline parameter space , where _ extent _ is taken to be the core radius of the @xmath76-model .",
    "the procedure allows us to assemble samples of extended x - ray sources that have a well - defined degree of contamination by miss - classified point - source ; these can be easily discarded a posteriori by examining the x - ray / optical overlays .",
    "we define two samples , c1 and c2 , for which the contamination is @xmath64 0 and @xmath64 50% respectively @xcite .",
    "this procedure , which operates in a two - dimensional parameter space , enables the construction of uncontaminated cluster samples significantly larger than those obtained by a simple flux limit .",
    "the selection criteria are subsequently converted into the probability of detecting a source characterized by a given core radius and flux .",
    "the c1 selection probability function is displayed in fig .",
    "[ c1sel ] . using the cluster model described in the previous paragraph ,",
    "we derive the limiting cluster mass detectable as a function of redshift for c1 and c2 respectively .",
    "since the current c1/c2 selection criteria have been defined for 10 ks xmm exposures , the resulting selection corresponds to clusters having @xmath78 , thus relatively massive objects as can be seen in fig .",

    "( i ) in a first step , we consider the same cluster selection functions independently of the survey configuration ( a or b ) .",
    "this means that for configuration a , the sample is defined from sub - exposures of 10 ks .",
    "the main goal of the total 40 ks integration time is to reach the x - ray spectral accuracy enabling accurate mass measurements .",
    "further , at the full depth of 40 ks , _ survey - a _ enables the detection of deeper cluster samples . consequently ( ii ) in a second step , we investigate the added cosmological value from clusters only detected in the 40 ks observations of _ survey - a_. we thus define a c20 class , a scaled - down version of the c2 population detected in 10 ks . since the c2 selection function is well depicted by a detection probability as a function of s / n , we simply derived the c20 detection efficiency by extrapolating the results of pacaud et al .",
