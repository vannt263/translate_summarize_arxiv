    "* ) . nevertheless , both approaches used to constraining progenitor masses have their uncertainties and caveats . for the direct progenitor detection method , the main problems are : 1 ) uncertainties in the stellar evolutionary models ( e.g.  treatment of mixing processes , rotation and mass - loss ) used to infer the mass ; 2 ) uncertainties in the extinction estimates @xcite , although @xcite substantially reduce the relevance of this problem ; and 3 ) possible selection effects because the method can be applied only to relatively close ( within @xmath10 30 mpc ) ll sne iip . for hydrodynamical modelling ,",

    "it is well known that almost identical light curves can be obtained for more than one set of the parameters describing the sn progenitor s physical properties at the time of the explosion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". this problem can , in turn , affect the search for possible correlations among the parameters , as correlations can be induced by covariance rather than by true physical effects @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we try to reduce the `` degeneracy '' in the best - fitting model parameters by fitting simultaneously the evolution of the line velocity , the continuum temperature and the light curve .",
    "two codes are employed for computing the models .",
    "the first is a semi - analytic code that solves the energy balance equation for ejecta of constant density in homologous expansion ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "the second is a general - relativistic , radiation - hydrodynamics lagrangian code that is specifically designed to simulate the behavior of the main sn observables and the evolution of the physical properties of the ejected material at the time of the explosion from the breakout of the shock wave at the stellar surface up to the radioactive - decay phase ( see @xcite and @xcite , for details ) .",
    "the distinctive features of this code are ( cf .  also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : a ) a fully general relativistic approach ; b ) an accurate treatment of radiative transfer coupled to hydrodynamics at all optical depth regimes ; c ) the coupling of the radiation moment equations with the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics during all the post - explosive evolution , adopting a fully implicit lagrangian finite difference scheme ; and d ) a description of the evolution of the ejected material which takes into account both the gravitational effects of the compact remnant and the heating effects linked to the decays of the radioactive isotopes synthesized during the sn explosion .",
    "the semi - analytic code is employed to carry out a preparatory analysis aimed at determining the parameter space describing the sn progenitor at the explosion .",
    "this guides the simulations performed with the general - relativistic , radiation - hydrodynamics code that are more realistic but time consuming .",
    "we point out that the models are appropriate when the sn emission is dominated by the expanding ejecta with no significant contamination from interaction . in performing the @xmath28 fit , the observational data taken at the earliest phases ( i.e.  within the first @xmath10 20 days after explosion ) are not included .",
    "this choice is made because the models could not accurately reproduce the early evolution of the main observables since the initial conditions used in the simulations are not able to precisely mimic the outermost high - velocity shell of the ejecta that forms after the shock breakout at the stellar surface ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .    as for the comparison between the observations and the simulated sn observables , we remind the reader that the observed bolometric light curve is reconstructed from multi - color photometry and reddening measurements , whereas the photospheric velocity and temperature are estimated from the observed spectra ( see sections 2.6 , 3.4 , and 5.1 of * ? ? ? * for details on these procedures ) .",
    "in particular , to estimate the photospheric velocity from the spectra , we use the minima of the profile of the sc lines or , when they are not available , the fe lines .    in the radiation - hydrodynamical modelling procedure the @xmath11 mass initially present in the ejecta of the models is held fixed and its value is set so as to reproduce the observed bolometric luminosity during the radioactive decay phase . to this end",
    ", the initial @xmath11 mass of the semi - analytic models is held fixed to that inferred from the observed late - time light curve .",
    "in the models computed with the general - relativistic , radiation - hydrodynamics code , the initial amount of @xmath11 is in general larger , since the code accounts also for the material ( including @xmath11 ) which falls back onto the compact remnant during the post - explosive evolution ( see @xcite and the results of the modelling of sn 2009e in @xcite ) .",
    "however , in all the models presented here , the fall - back is negligible ( a few hundredths of a solar mass ) and , consequently , the initial @xmath11 mass essentially coincides ( within the errors ) with that inferred from the observations . other quantities held fixed in the radiation - hydrodynamical modelling procedure are the explosion epoch and the distance modulus .",
    "they are both used for determining the observed bolometric light curve and the evolution of the observed photospheric velocity and temperature as a function of phase .",
    "the free model parameters of the fit are the ejected mass @xmath24 , the progenitor radius at the time of the explosion @xmath25 and the total explosion energy @xmath26 .",
    "although the evaluation of their uncertainties is not straightforward ( see also * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we estimate that the typical error due to the @xmath28 fitting procedure is @xmath10 10 - 15% for @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath10 20 - 30% for @xmath26 .",
    "these errors are the 2-@xmath29 confidence intervals for one parameter based on the @xmath28 distributions produced by the semi - analytical models .",
    "we used these models to determine the confidence intervals because it is needed a sufficiently high coverage of the parameter space , which is obtained through the calculation of thousands of models .",
    "the computation of such an extensive grid of models with the general - relativistic , radiation - hydrodynamics code is too expensive in terms of cpu time ( e.g. , running a single general - relativistic , radiation - hydrodynamics model takes up to @xmath10 4 - 6 days )",
    ".    the inferred uncertainties on the best - fitting model parameters do not include possible systematic errors related to the input physics ( e.g.  opacity treatment , degree of @xmath11 mixing and he / h ratio in the ejecta of the models ) nor uncertainties on the assumptions made in evaluating the observational quantities ( e.g.  the adopted reddening , explosion epoch and distance modulus ) .",
    "a discussion of the approximations on the input physics and the ensuing systematic errors can be found in @xcite , while a detailed study of the effects of different opacity treatments on our radiation - hydrodynamical modelling will be presented in pumo et al .",
    "( in prep . ) . here , we recall that variations of the degree of @xmath11 mixing and the he / h ratio mainly affect the plateau length of the models and not the simulated plateau luminosity or expansion velocity ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . as a consequence , uncertainties related to these quantities should lead mainly to errors in the value of @xmath24 as the plateau length depends mostly on it .",
    "similar conclusions are also valid for uncertainties on quantities ( e.g.  the adopted explosion epoch ) that mainly affect the observed plateau length and , only to a secondary extent , the behaviour of the observed photospheric velocity and temperature .",
    "uncertainties related to the distance modulus or the adopted reddening basically produce a systematic variation in the brightness of the observed bolometric light curve at all phases and affect all three best - fitting model parameters .",
    "for example , the uncertainties on the reddening adopted for sn 2012aw modify the best - fitting model parameters obtained with our radiation - hydrodynamical modelling procedure by @xmath10 15 - 30% ( specifically @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 vary up to @xmath10 20% , 30% and 15% , respectively ; see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "somewhat larger changes in the best - fitting model parameters ( specifically @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 vary up to @xmath10 25% , 30% and 35% , respectively ) are found after modifying the distance modulus of sn 2005cs from the value of 29.26 assumed by @xcite to the one of 29.46 adopted in @xcite .",
    "although in these two test cases the variations of the best - fitting model parameters are significant , they do not have a dramatic impact on the overall results and the progenitor scenario .",
    "we model the well - studied ll sne iip 2003z , 2008bk and 2009md .",

    "[ modelling ] ) , which are reported for the sake of comparison .    as it can be seen in the top panel of table [ tab_systematics ] , all the model parameters ( with the only exception of @xmath25 ) as well as the ratio @xmath26/@xmath24 and the @xmath11 mass of the faint sne iip are systematically lower than those for the intermediate - luminosity objects , showing that the progenitors of the faint sne iip are slightly less massive and experience less energetic explosions than the progenitors of the intermediate - luminosity objects .",
    "moreover , our radiation - hydrodynamical models suggests that the present sample of faint sne iip and intermediate - luminosity objects originate from stars of low - to - intermediate mass , in agreement with the results found for some of them by modelling their progenitors .",
    "in particular we find that the best - fit model parameters of all the modelled ll sne iip are consistent with low - energy explosions of red ( or yellow ) supergiant stars and , for some faint objects ( sne 2009md and 2008bk as well as sn 2005cs , whose model is presented in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they can also be consistent with explosions of massive , super - asymptotic giant branch stars as electron - capture sne .",
    "the data reported in table [ tab_systematics ] and figures [ fig : bol ] to [ fig : correl2 ] also confirm that ll sne iip form the underluminous tail of the family of sne iip ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "with the warning that our sample could be still too small to draw final conclusions , the main parameter `` guiding '' the distribution seems to be the ratio of @xmath26 to @xmath24 , not just the explosion energy @xmath26 .",
    "indeed , figures [ fig : correl1 ] and [ fig : correl2 ] reveal a relationship between the observed quantities such as the plateau luminosity and the @xmath11 mass and the ratio @xmath36 , which monotonously increases from @xmath10 0.015 - 0.02 to @xmath10 0.04 up to values @xmath20 0.05 , when passing from faint to intermediate - luminosity up to `` standard - luminosity '' events , respectively .",
    "it is also clear that the data , in particular the correlation of @xmath11 with @xmath36 in figure [ fig : correl2 ] , show significant scatter . indeed , although the explosion energy as well as the other model parameters and the @xmath11 mass tend to increase when moving from ll sne iip to sne iip of standard luminosity , there are several exceptions ( see table [ tab_systematics ] ) .",
    "for example , sn 2013ab , a sn iip with standard luminosity , is characterized by an explosion energy of 0.35 foe , significantly lower than the explosion energies of standard sne iip and between those of faint sne and the ones of intermediate - luminosity objects . also the ejected mass is small and has the lowest value of the sample of sne iip reported in table [ tab_systematics ] .",
    "on the other hand , the ratio @xmath36 , the radius at the explosion and the @xmath11 mass are similar to those of standard sne iip , explaining the normal luminosity of this object .",
    "another exception is sn 2009ib ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an intermediate - luminosity object with @xmath11 mass closer to that of normal sne iip , explosion energy slightly higher than the one of the other intermediate - luminosity objects and ejected mass among the highest of the sample of sne iip reported in table [ tab_systematics ] .",
    "however the ratio @xmath36 is very close to that of the other intermediate - luminosity objects , explaining the intermediate luminosity of this sn .",
    "other minor outliers are : sn 2008bk with its relatively large radius at explosion and sn 2013ej with a value of @xmath11 mass closer to that of intermediate - luminosity objects and an ejected mass similar to that of faint sne .",
    "in order to improve our knowledge of the real nature of the progenitors of ll sne iip , we made radiation - hydrodynamical models of the well - studied sne 2003z , 2008bk and 2009md members of this sub - group of explosive events .",
    "we used the same well - tested approach applied to several other observed sne ( e.g.  2007od , 2009bw , 2009e , 2009n , 2009ib , 2012a , 2012aw , 2012ec and 2013ab ; see @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite , respectively ) . in this approach , the sn progenitor s physical properties at explosion ( namely the ejected mass @xmath24 ,",
    "the progenitor radius at the time of the explosion @xmath25 and the total explosion energy @xmath26 ) are constrained by modelling the bolometric light curve , the evolution of line velocities and the temperature of the photosphere , and performing a simultaneous @xmath27 fit of the model calculations to these observables .",
    "the inferred parameters describing the sn progenitors and their ejecta for sne 2003z , 2008bk and 2009md are fully consistent with low - energy explosions of red supergiant stars with relatively low mass , although the value of @xmath25 could also suggest yellow supergiant stars as the progenitors of sne 2003z and 2009md .",
    "the best - fitting model parameters inferred for sne 2008bk and 2009md may also be consistent with the explosion of super - asymptotic giant branch stars with initial masses close to the upper limit of the mass range typical of this class of stars .    assuming a mass of @xmath10 1.3 - 2 for the compact remnant and a `` standard '' ( i.e.  not enhanced by rotation ) mass loss during the pre - sn evolution",
    ", we estimate that the progenitor masses on the zams are in the range @xmath6-@xmath7 for sn 2003z and in the range @xmath8-@xmath9 for sne 2008bk and 2009md .",
    "the latter two estimates agree with those based on direct observation of the progenitors .",
    "since these results were obtained in the same way as those for sne 2005cs , 2008 in , 2009n , 2009ib and 2012a , we can conduct a comparative study on this sub - group of sne iip .",
    "the main findings of this comparative analysis can be summarized as follows :    * the progenitors of faint sne iip are slightly less massive and experience less energetic explosions than the progenitors of the intermediate - luminosity objects , even though both faint sne iip and intermediate - luminosity objects originate from low - energy explosions of red ( or yellow ) supergiant stars of low - to - intermediate mass ; * some faint sne iip may also be explained as electron - capture sne involving massive super - asymptotic giant branch stars , although the existence of such explosive events is still not completely proven ; * ll sne iip form the underluminous tail of the family of sne iip where the main parameter `` guiding '' the distribution seems to be the ratio @xmath36 .",
    "admittedly , our sample is still too small to draw final conclusions .",
    "for this reason , other studies based on a larger sample of ll sne iip , including also more extreme events as sne 1999br - like , are needed to confirm these findings .",
    "moreover it should be useful to further check the results performing the radiation - hydrodynamical modelling in a `` self - consistent '' way , that is to say using numerical calculations which include the sn explosion and the explosive nucleosynthesis , and that start from pre - sn models evaluated by means of stellar evolution codes ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for further details ) .",
    "although none of the ll sn iip in our sample appears to be well modelled with massive ejecta and/or explained in terms of a fall - back sn , at present we can not rule out that a minor fraction of their progenitors may be more massive than @xmath10 15 and/or undergo significant fall - back . while a larger sample of ll sne iip is necessary to draw any firm conclusion ,",
    "recent one - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of neutrino - driven sne @xcite indicate that there is no monotonic progenitor mass dependence of the properties of core - collapse sne . more specifically , for certain progenitor structures at explosion , not even particularly massive stars ( 15@xmath21 initial mass @xmath21 40 ) could lead to direct collapse and the formation of a black hole ( see * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , it is possible that extreme and comparatively rarer events with very low ejected @xmath11 and explosion energy may hide among ll sne iip perhaps with more somewhat different observational properties and be explained in terms of almost failed explosions of not - particularly - massive stars undergoing significant fall - back , as suggested earlier by @xcite .",
    "for example , in the simulations of @xcite and @xcite , fall - back sne occur in only a few cases for progenitor stars with initial masses in the range @xmath10 25 - 40 and , in these cases , the explosion properties ( i.e.  explosion energy , ejected mass , and amount of @xmath11 ) seem to be qualitatively similar to those of observed ll sne iip , albeit somewhat more extreme .",
    "however , as observed by the same authors ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the results of such simulations must be used with caution for a direct comparison with the observed properties of ll sne iip , because 1 ) they are based on sets of progenitor models which , even for similar initial masses , exhibit large structural variations that may not be completely realistic , and 2 ) the simulations do not consider multidimensional effects that can play a critical role in the core - collapse sn mechanism ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "so additional multidimensional hydrodynamical studies focused on the progenitor - explosion and progenitor - remnant connections should be performed and compared to a sufficiently extended sample of ll sne iip before drawing any final conclusion on the possible occurrence of fall - back in some ll sne iip .",
    "observationally , a statistically sound test on the existence of progenitors having significant fall - back will come by searching for failed sne ( see e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and from larger numbers of direct progenitor detections .",
    "if a stringent mass progenitor upper limit of @xmath10 15 will be established , then this would severely limit the occurrence of such a process .",
    "in such a case , either successful and completely failed explosions form two `` final states '' separated by a sharp transition , the outcome of which depending on fine details of the internal structure of their progenitors , or almost failed explosions are not seen because they are typically too weak to be detected in present surveys .",
