    "the type ia supernova ( sn ia ) observations indicate that the expansion of the universe is speeding up rather than slowing down @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the measurement of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) favors a flat universe @xcite .",
    "the observation of type ia supernova sn 1997ff at @xmath12 also provides the evidence that the universe is in the acceleration phase and was in the deceleration phase in the past @xcite .",
    "the transition from the deceleration phase to the acceleration phase happened around the redshift @xmath13 @xcite . in this paper , we use the notation @xmath3 for the transition redshift . a new component with negative pressure widely referred as dark energy is usually introduced to explain the accelerating expansion .",
    "the simplest form of dark energy is the cosmological constant with the equation of state parameter @xmath14 .",
    "one easily generalizes the cosmological constant model to dynamical cosmological constant models such as the dark energy model with negative constant equation of state parameter @xmath15 and the holographic dark energy models @xcite .",
    "if we remove the null energy condition restriction @xmath16 to allow supernegative @xmath17 , then we have the phantom energy models @xcite .",
    "more exotic equation of state is also possible , such as the chaplygin gas model with the equation of state @xmath18 and the generalized chaplygin gas model with the equation of state @xmath19 @xcite . in general , a scalar field @xmath20 that slowly evolves down its potential @xmath21 takes the role of a dynamical cosmological constant .",
    "the scalar field @xmath20 is also called the quintessence field @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the energy density of the quintessence field must remain very small compared with that of radiation or matter at early epoches and evolves in a way that it started to dominate the universe around the redshift @xmath22 . instead of the quintessence field with the usual kinetic term @xmath23 , tachyon field as dark energy",
    "was also proposed @xcite .",
    "the tachyon models have the accelerated phase followed by the decelerated phase .    although most dark energy models are consistent with current observations , the nature of dark energy is still mysterious .",
    "therefore it is also possible that the observations show a sign of the breakdown of the standard cosmology .",
    "some alternative models to dark energy models were proposed along this line of reasoning .",
    "these models are motivated by extra dimensions . in these models , the usual friedmann equation @xmath24 is modified to a general form @xmath25 and the universe is composed of the ordinary matter only @xcite-@xcite . in other words ,",
    "the dark energy component is unnecessary .    in this paper",
    ", i first use the 58 sn ia data in ref .  , the 186 sn ia data in ref .   and wmap data @xcite to constrain the parameter space of a general class of quintessence models discussed in ref .  .",
    "in that model , a general relation between the potential energy and the kinetic energy of the quintessence field was proposed . as we know",
    ", the average kinetic energy is the same as the average potential energy for a point mass in a harmonic oscillator . for a stable , self - gravitating , spherical distribution of equal mass objects , the total kinetic energy of the objects is equal to minus 1/2 times the total gravitational potential energy .",
    "therefore , the physics of dark energy may be determined if the relationship between the potential energy and the kinetic energy is known .",
    "then i consider three different model independent parameterizations of @xmath26 to find out some properties of dark energy .",
    "after we determine the parameters in these models , the transition redshift @xmath3 is obtained .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after a brief introduction in section 1 ,",
    "the general class of models is reviewed in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "i discuss the methodology used in this paper . in section 4 ,",
    "i give the main fitting results . in section 5 ,",
    "i conclude the paper by using a model independent analysis and compare the results with those in the literature .",
    "for a spatially flat , isotropic and homogeneous universe with both an ordinary pressureless dust matter and a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath20 source , the friedmann equations are @xmath27 where dot means derivative with respect to time , @xmath28 is the matter energy density , a subscript 0 means the value of the variable at present time , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath21 is the potential of the quintessence field . in ref .  , a general relationship @xmath32 was proposed instead of assuming a particular potential for the quintessence field or a particular form of the scale factor , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constants .",
    "note that the above equation ( [ assm1 ] ) is a constraint equation , one should not just substitute the above equation into the lagrangian and thinks that the model is equivalent to a @xmath35 kinetic term plus a cosmological constant term @xmath34 .",
    "the above general potential includes the hyperbolic potential and the double exponential potential . in terms of @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    ", we have @xmath38\\rho_{\\rm q0},\\\\ \\label{eng1 } \\rho_{\\rm q}&=&(1/2+\\beta)(1+\\omega_{\\rm q0})\\rho_{\\rm q0}\\left({a_0\\over a}\\right)^{6/(2\\beta+1 ) } + \\left[{1\\over 2}-\\beta-\\left({1\\over 2}+\\beta\\right)\\omega_{\\rm q0}\\right]\\rho_{\\rm q0},\\\\ \\label{qup1 } p_{\\rm q}&=&(1/2-\\beta)(1+\\omega_{\\rm q0})\\rho_{\\rm q0}\\left({a_0\\over a}\\right)^{6/(2\\beta+1 ) } -\\left[{1\\over 2}-\\beta-\\left({1\\over 2}+\\beta\\right)\\omega_{\\rm q0}\\right]\\rho_{\\rm q0},\\\\ \\label{hub } h^2&=&{8\\pi g\\over 3}\\left\\{\\rho_{\\rm m0}\\left(a_0\\over a\\right)^3+(1/2+\\beta)(1+\\omega_{\\rm q0})\\rho_{\\rm q0}\\left({a_0\\over a}\\right)^{6/(2\\beta+1 ) } + c\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to make the quintessence field sub - dominated during early times , we require that @xmath39 . the transition from deceleration to acceleration happens when the deceleration parameter @xmath40 . from equations ( [ cos2 ] ) , ( [ eng1 ] ) and ( [ qup1 ] ) , in terms of the redshift parameter @xmath41",
    ", we have @xmath42{\\rho_{\\rm q0}\\over \\rho_{\\rm m0}}=0.\\ ] ] this equation gives a relationship between @xmath37 and @xmath43 .",
    "now let us turn our attention to two special cases .",

    "case 2 : @xmath51 , the pressure of the scalar field becomes a constant @xmath52 and the potential is the double exponential potential @xcite @xmath53+{\\alpha^2a^2\\over 6\\pi g}-{a^2\\over 4}.\\ ] ] the constant pressure model is equivalent to an ordinary matter with effective matter content @xmath54 plus a cosmological constant @xmath55 .",
    "in order to use the wmap result , one usually parameterizes the location of the @xmath56-th peak of cmb power spectrum as @xcite @xmath57 where the acoustic scale @xmath58 is @xmath59 the conformal time at the last scattering @xmath60 and at today @xmath61 are @xmath62\\omega_{\\rm q0},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath63 is the current radiation component and @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the difficulty of this method is that there are several undetermined parameters , such as @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "instead , we use the cmb shift parameter @xmath67 @xcite to constrain the model .",

    "@xmath74 can be determined from the low redshift limit at where @xmath75 .",
    "we use the 54 sne ia data with both the stretch correction and the host - galaxy extinction correction , i.e. , the fit 3 supernova data in ref .",
    "( we refer the data as knop sample ) , and the 186 sne ia data in ref .",
    "( we refer the data as riess sample ) to constrain the model .",
    "the parameters in the model are determined using a @xmath76-minimization procedure based on minuit code .",
    "there are four parameters in the fit : the current mass density @xmath77 , the current dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath37 , the constant @xmath33 as well as the nuisance parameter @xmath74 .",
