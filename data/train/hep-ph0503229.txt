    "@xmath0 violation ( cpv ) was discovered@xcite in @xmath6-@xmath7 mixing in 1964 . with it",
    "we came to realize , in terms of the sakharov conditions,@xcite that cpv is a prerequisite for understanding the baryon asymmetry of our universe .",
    "however , it took another 35 years , until the measurement@xcite of @xmath8 , or  direct \" cpv ( dcpv ) , for us to put the superweak@xcite ( cpv in @xmath6 mixing only , but not in @xmath9 decay ) model to rest .",
    "thus was the paucity of cpv in the last century .",
    "the 21st century began with a roaring start in observations of cpv in the @xmath10 meson system .",
    "indirect cpv , or cpv in @xmath2-@xmath11 mixing , was firmly established@xcite in 2001 . by 2004 , dcpv was established@xcite in @xmath12 decay .",
    "the history of the kaon system was repeated , in not quite the same way , in just 3 years .",
    "the @xmath10 system also opens up a host of cpv and other observables .",
    "the precursor to the modern view of cpv came a year before 1964 , with the cabibbo angle ( @xmath13 ) proposal@xcite that unified strange and nonstrange weak decays . by 1970 ,",
    "the gim mechanism called for two generations of quarks and leptons , making @xmath13 a genuine rotation angle of a @xmath14 matrix .",
    "the two generation picture was completed with the @xmath15 discovery of november 1974 .",
    "but in 1973 , kobayashi and maskawa ( km ) realized@xcite that , upon generalizing quark mixing to 3 generations , i.e. from @xmath14 to @xmath16 matrix , one has a _",
    "unique _ cpv phase .",
    "together with the establishment of the gauge theory of strong and electorweak interactions , by the mid-1970 s the ckm quark mixing picture became an integral part of the standard model ( sm ) , which has withstood test upon test for the past 30 years .",
    "the @xmath17 parameter suffers from hadronic uncertainties that make the extraction of fundamental parameters difficult . in 1979",
    "it was realized@xcite that the @xmath10 system offers much better prospects .",
    "in the so - called mixing - decay cpv mechanism in @xmath18 , not only one expects the effect to be large , but because the decay amplitude is free from cpv phases , one can make a clean measure of the cpv phase @xmath19 ( also called @xmath20 ) in the ckm  unitarity triangle \" .",
    "several developments were pivotal to the realization of such measurements . in 1983",
    ", the @xmath10 hadron lifetime was found to be much prolonged,@xcite and @xmath21 transitions dominated over @xmath22 transitions .",
    "this stimulated the application of silicon based vertex detectors , while we now know that , taking @xmath23 as real , we have @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath260.4 .",
    "it is remarkable that the progressive smallness of off - diagonal ckm matrix elements explains why cpv effect is so small in sm , as one needs the participation of all 3 generations .",
    "second , in 1987 the argus experiment discovered@xcite large @xmath2-@xmath3 oscillations , i.e. @xmath27 .",
    "this was not only the harbinger for the heaviness of the top quark , it provided an almost ideal setting for the mixing - decay cpv mechanism to be realized .",
    "finally , as the cleo experiment was making upgrades , and when discussions were ongoing at psi for a new @xmath10 facility , oddone suggested in 1988 to make the @xmath28 and @xmath29 beams _ asymmetric _ in energy .",
    "the boosted @xmath10 mesons made time - dependent measurements possible .",
    "serious studies soon followed at kek and slac , and by 1994 both places embarked on the construction of asymmetric @xmath30  b factories \" , the very successful kekb and pep - ii colliders , as well as the belle and babar detectors . after commissioning in 1999 , by 2004",
    "each experiment had accumulated more than 200 m @xmath31 events , more than a factor of 20 over what cleo collected throughout the 1990 s .",
    "the aim of this brief review is to give an account of the competitive history , the major milestones , as well as the ongoing debates if not controversies .",
    "the physics of cpv in mixing - decay interference is rather close to the classic double slit experiment . consider a @xmath0 eigenstate @xmath33 that both @xmath3 and @xmath2 can decay to .",
    "besides the @xmath34 decay amplitude , an initial @xmath3 meson can oscillate into a @xmath2 meson and then decay to @xmath33 .",
    "the interference pattern is measured to determine cpv in both the mixing and decay amplitudes .",
    "we note that cpv is measurable only when the two interfering amplitudes , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , have both @xmath0 violating as well as @xmath0 conserving relative phase differences .",
    "that is , @xmath37 which vanishes if either the @xmath0 violating or @xmath0 conserving phase differences @xmath38 , @xmath39 vanish . here",
    ", the oscillation phase @xmath40 provides the latter .    for the  golden mode \" of @xmath41 ,",
    "the @xmath42 decay is dominated by the tree level @xmath43 hence @xmath44 in amplitude .",
    "thus , to a very good approximation , the decay amplitude is real , and the mixing - decay mechanism measures the cpv phase in the @xmath45 mixing amplitude , which is @xmath46 in sm .",
    "the ckm quark mixing matrix @xmath47 governs the strength of @xmath48 weak transitions . with eq .",
    "( [ eqn : vcbvub ] ) , it can be put in the form @xmath49 to order @xmath50 .",
    "the matrix @xmath47 is unitary , and the relation we probe is @xmath51 which is visualized as the unitarity triangle ( ut ) shown in fig .",
    "1 . it is remarkable that the fundamental phenomena of cpv can have such simple geometric representation .",
    "the cpv phase of @xmath52 probed by @xmath53 is @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) .      at b factories ,",
    "the time - dependent cpv ( tcpv ) asymmetry for @xmath54 decay is @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the @xmath0 eigenvalue of @xmath33 , @xmath58 denotes the state at time @xmath59 starting from @xmath2 at @xmath60 , and ( babar uses @xmath61 ) @xmath62 where @xmath63 measures dcpv , and @xmath64 is defined as @xmath65 which depends on both @xmath2 mixing , i.e. @xmath66 , and decay to state @xmath33 .",
    "the lifetime difference between the two neutral @xmath10 mesons have been ignored ( a very good approximation for @xmath67 ) , so @xmath68 ( so @xmath69 ) . for the golden @xmath70 mode ,",
    "the decay amplitude is real in the standard phase convention , hence @xmath71 to very good accuracy .",
    "many other @xmath72 modes are also collected and , correcting for @xmath57 , adds to the statistics .",
    "the @xmath70 events are collected by detecting @xmath73 ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 ( and @xmath77 ) .",
    "two cms variables that utilize the special kinematics of @xmath78 decay greatly enhances signal over background events .",
    "one is the beam - constrained mass @xmath79 , and the other is the energy difference @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the measured momentum and energy in cms .",
    "knowing that @xmath78 only , and substituting the much better known cms beam energy @xmath83 for @xmath84 greatly improves resolution .    two special requirements in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : acpt ] ) make construction of the b factories necessary .",
    "since the @xmath70 final state can not tell between @xmath2 or @xmath3 decay , we need to  tag \" its flavor . at b factories",
    "one utilizes the quantum phenomenon that , after @xmath85 decay , the @xmath31 system remains coherent until one of the @xmath10 mesons decays .",
    "assuming that this  tagging \" side is a @xmath10 decay at @xmath86 , then the other side evolves as a @xmath3 meson until it decays to the @xmath0 eigenmode @xmath70 at time @xmath87 .",
    "thus , @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : acpt ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath59 can be of either sign .",
    "since @xmath10 momentum in @xmath85 frame is very small , to observe the decay points of the two @xmath10 mesons , one boosts the @xmath85 frame at an asymmetric b factory . to a very good approximation @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the boost of @xmath85 in lab frame , and @xmath91 and 0.425 , respectively , for pep - ii and kekb .",
    "one also needs a vertex detector ( svt at babar and svd at belle ) of sufficient accuracy . for flavor tagging ,",
    "one utilizes primary @xmath92 and secondary @xmath93 leptons , secondary @xmath94 and @xmath95 s from @xmath96 sequence , low energy @xmath97 from @xmath98 , and high energy tracks such as @xmath99 s from @xmath100 .",
    "the results are combined into a multidimensional likelihood function to determine a tag - side charge @xmath101 .",
    "reconstructed self - tagged modes ( such as @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 etc . ) from actual data are used to measure the wrong - tag fraction @xmath105 ( leading to a dilution factor of @xmath106 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : acpt ] ) ) for each tagging or purity category @xmath107 .",
    "the total effective tagging efficiency is around 0.270.28 .",
    "one final technicality is  blind \" analysis . since the @xmath0 asymmetry",
    "@xmath108 can be of either sign , the analysis is performed ",
    "blind \" to avoid bias .",
    "that is , the value of @xmath19 ( and the @xmath0 asymmetry in the @xmath59 distribution ) from the fit remains hidden until the analysis is completed .",
    "the statistical error is largely unaffected , but all systematic uncertainties can be studied without knowing the value of @xmath19 .      after approval in 1993 and 1994 , respectively , both the slac and kek b factories were commissioned successfully and reported engineering results in 1999 . based on 9 and 6.2 fb@xmath109 of data , respectively , the first measurements for @xmath20 and @xmath19 were reported at the ichep 2000 meeting in osaka,@xcite @xmath110 which , being consistent with zero , gave physicists the impression that @xmath20 might deviate@xcite from sm expectations !",
    "this continued to be the case , especially for babar , with the first published results,@xcite @xmath111    compared to the summer 2004 average of@xcite @xmath112 ( b factory average is 0.725 ) babar s result is low by @xmath113 . just before lepton - photon 2001 , however , babar reported@xcite @xmath114 only 9 m @xmath31 events were added , but with significant improvement in svt alignment .",
    "also , analysis method was improved . when applied to previous data of 23 m @xmath31 events , the result was @xmath115 .",
    "but for the 2001 data of 9 m , the result was @xmath116 , which deviated by 1.8@xmath117 from 1999 - 2000 result .",
    "on the other hand , belle reported at lp01 the stunning result of@xcite @xmath118 although at some variance , the combined result of 0.79 not only established cpv in @xmath10 system beyond doubt .",
    "it is also quite consistent with the 2004 hfag average , showing the power of having two b factories .",
    "both belle and babar published details of their 2001 analysis , while another round of analyses in 2002 gave @xmath119 which are in rather good agreement .",
    "the case is fully settled .",
    "we plot the measurements of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : phi1osaka])([eqn : phi102 ] ) in fig .  2 .",
    "direct @xmath0 asymmetry @xmath120 has also been searched for and is found to be consistent with zero , confirming the expectation in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : jpsiks ] ) . polarization and triple",
    "product correlations have also been studied in @xmath121 decays , where 3 partial waves are present . although evidence is found for final state interactions , no indication was found for deviations from sm .",
    "the current average @xmath19 value of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : phi104 ] ) is in good agreement with a global fit@xcite to @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 data and limit on @xmath125 mixing .",
    "up to a four fold ambiguity , the preferred value for @xmath126 in fig .  1 is @xmath127 .",
    "the _ raison dtre _ of the b factories was already completed within two years of turning on , and @xmath19 is now a precision measurement .",
    "no indication is found for deviation from the km picture of cpv .",
    "in early times , it was thought that @xmath129 decay would proceed by the @xmath130 tree diagram , hence the decay amplitude ratio @xmath131 ( or @xmath132 ) , so @xmath133 .",
    "one could thus measure @xmath134 via the @xmath135 mode .",
    "if @xmath130 tree dominance were true , one would also expect @xmath136 to vanish .",
    "this picture was already shattered by the cleo observation@xcite of @xmath137 before @xmath138 .",
    "the @xmath139 tree process should be suppressed by @xmath140 in rate w.r.t . the @xmath130 tree process .",
    "the cleo observation clearly demonstrates that the loop - induced ",
    "penguin \" @xmath141 process dominates @xmath142 . with a @xmath137 rate 4 times that of @xmath135 mode , we now expect the penguin amplitude to be of order 30% of the tree for @xmath129 decay .",
    "the penguin amplitude not only brings in weak phases , it could introduce strong phases relative to the tree amplitude as well .",
    "it is common practice to write@xcite @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the magnitudes of the tree and penguin amplitudes , and @xmath146 is their strong phase difference .",
    "one can see that , if @xmath147 , then @xmath148 , but for @xmath149 , the extraction of @xmath150 becomes rather complicated . the presence of @xmath145 and @xmath146 also bring in hadronic uncertainties that are hard to deal with theoretically .",
    "as there are more parameters than measurables , an isospin analysis@xcite involving @xmath151 and @xmath77 modes is necessary to fit for @xmath152 and @xmath146 , in addition to @xmath150 and @xmath126 .      as if theoretical difficulties were not enough , belle and babar have not yet reached mutual agreement on their measurements of @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the first measurement was reported by babar in 2001 based on 33 m @xmath31 pairs,@xcite @xmath155 which is a null measurement serving the purpose of establishing technique .",
    "then came the astonishing result@xcite from belle in 2002 , based on @xmath156 m @xmath31 pairs , @xmath157 which is in strong contrast ( note that @xmath158 ; see eq .",

    "( [ eqn : acpt ] ) , it is possible for measured @xmath153 , @xmath154 values to lie outside the  physical \" region , especially if the cpv effect is large .    the next round came summer 2002 from babar with more than twice the data,@xcite @xmath161 which confirmed their earlier result",
    "this was followed by belle in early 2003,@xcite @xmath162 which also confirmed their earlier result .",

    "belle has just updated@xcite with full 2004 dataset of 275 m @xmath31 pairs , giving @xmath174 where @xmath153 shifted downwards by more than 1@xmath117 , and now the central value satisfies @xmath160 .",
    "however , the conflict between belle and babar remains at @xmath175 .",
    "the results of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : alpha01])([eqn : phi205 ] ) are plotted in fig .",
    "it is not clear whether the deviation between belle and babar on @xmath135 results is due to background , analysis method , or statistical fluctuation",

    "the latest analysis ( 227 m ) of babar , making a multivariate , maximum likelihood and simultaneous fit for @xmath135 and @xmath185 ( and @xmath186 ) , is less transparent : out of 68030 fitted events , @xmath187 events are extracted , together with @xmath188 events . compared to the @xmath70 signal purity of over 97% and a larger effective rate , background is certainly much more significant in the @xmath189 analysis . from fig .  3",
    ", however , it is clear that there is some tendency of convergence between belle and babar as more data is added . but combining the results may not yet be a good idea .      to extract @xmath128 from @xmath189 modes , an isospin analysis@xcite involving also the @xmath151 and @xmath77 modes is needed .",
    "the @xmath151 rate is relatively well measured.@xcite with 124 m @xmath31 pairs , babar found strong evidence@xcite for the @xmath77 mode with rate at @xmath191 , roughly half the @xmath135 rate .",
    "this is much larger than factorization expectations , but it is good for isospin analysis .",
    "using 275 m @xmath31 pairs , belle observed@xcite the @xmath77 mode at @xmath192 with 5.8@xmath117 significance .",
    "however , with 227 m @xmath31 pairs , the babar number went down to@xcite @xmath193 with 5.0@xmath117 significance . a @xmath113 conflict exists , while the errors are still too large for performing the @xmath150 program . and",
    "in any case , there is an 8-fold ambiguity for @xmath150 determined this way .",
    "the path to @xmath150 seems long and tortuous .",
    "the @xmath194 and @xmath195 systems are the @xmath196 and @xmath197 counterparts of the @xmath189 system , but clearly more complicated .",
    "the @xmath194 system can not be a @xmath0 eigenstate .",
    "in fact , @xmath198 and @xmath199 are both possible .",
    "it has been suggested@xcite that , together with @xmath200 , a @xmath201-dependent dalitz plot analysis of @xmath202 can in principle determine @xmath203 or @xmath150 without discrete ambiguities , the latter resolved by the interference regions . even with the simplifying assumption of @xmath204 dominance of the dalitz plot ,",
    "this is a very difficult program .",

    "there seems to be strong phase difference between tree and penguin amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath197 modes have 3 helicity amplitudes .",
    "babar has found the @xmath210 mode to be predominantly longitudinal , hence is largely a @xmath0 eigenstate .",

    "their current measurements of @xmath212 and @xmath213 are consistent with zero . using isospin relations and their results for @xmath214 and @xmath211 modes , babar gives@xcite @xmath215 , where the last error is due to penguin uncertainties .",
    "belle , however , has yet to give their results .",
    "given that the @xmath195 analysis is more complicated than the @xmath189 case , and babar and belle are in dispute on the latter , we feel it is premature to conclude .",
    "we note , however , that @xmath216 is in good agreement with the  ckm fit\"@xcite result not utilizing cpv @xmath10 measurements .",
    "as we have seen , penguin @xmath141 processes dominate over the tree @xmath139 process , enhancing e.g. the @xmath217 mode over the @xmath138 mode by a factor of 4 in rate .",
    "the @xmath5 penguins are induced by virtual loops involving @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 quarks , which are governed by the ut relation @xmath221 unlike the ut relation of eq .",

    "we conclude that one has to wait further to see whether there is deviation from sm in tcpv in the @xmath263 and @xmath231 modes . the results for @xmath264 and @xmath241 in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : etapksbelle02])([eqn : sqq04_phiks ] ) are plotted in fig .",
    "a host of other penguin dominant @xmath5 modes have also been studied .",
    "the first such study@xcite is @xmath265 ( excluding @xmath237 ) by belle , which has a large rate and was found to be predominantly @xmath0 even . by now",
    "one has measurements@xcite in @xmath266 , @xmath267 ( @xmath0 eigenstate by angular momentum ) , @xmath268 , @xmath269 , and @xmath270 modes .",
    "the latter is studied by belle only , disagreement exist in @xmath267 and @xmath268 modes , but the effective @xmath32 value in @xmath266 and @xmath269 modes are 1@xmath117 or more below 0.726 .",
    "although the scatter among modes differ , the effective @xmath19 measured in @xmath5 penguins measured by belle and babar are both significantly below the charmonium result . the b factory average is@xcite @xmath271 which is 3.8@xmath117 below @xmath272 .",
    "there seems to be some real effect in penguin dominant @xmath5 modes .    besides the conflicts between eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : etapksbabar04 ] ) , ( [ eqn : phiksbabar04 ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : sqq04_etapks ] ) , ( [ eqn : sqq04_phiks ] ) , we remark that there are limitations for what one can interpret from deviations in penguin dominant @xmath228 hadronic modes .",
    "while a large , definite effect in a single mode such as @xmath237 would clearly indicate np , these modes suffer from large hadronic uncertainties , such that the np effect would vary from mode to mode .",
    "so , whether @xmath237 or @xmath273 , or the combined effect in @xmath141 , one does not gain much more information by accumulating modes .",
    "it is difficult to extract fundamental information of the underlying np .",
    "what may be more useful in the long run is @xmath274 decay .",
    "the left - handedness of weak interactions imply @xmath275 , where @xmath276 is a left - helicity photon ; the @xmath277 component is suppressed by @xmath278 in amplitude .",
    "this implies that , for @xmath279 , tcpv in @xmath280 @xmath0 eigenstate is suppressed by @xmath278 hence close to zero , because one needs the interference between @xmath3 and @xmath281 amplitudes with same photon helicity , but one of which is always suppressed in sm .",
    "this is therefore@xcite an excellent probe of np that generates the  wrong \" helicity amplitude , whether the np involves new cpv phases or not .",
    "this program seemed difficult because of poor vertex resolution for the @xmath282 final state .",
    "but in summer 2003 , babar showed@xcite that tcpv could be measured in the aforementioned @xmath269 mode , utilizing a unique feature for the b factories , viz . that the @xmath10 direction is very close to the high energy beam ( @xmath28 at present ) direction . this ",
    "@xmath283 vertexing \" technique can be applied to @xmath282 , and has now been pursued by both babar and belle .",
    "the beauty of studying tcpv in @xmath284 mode is that hadronic effects are largely in the @xmath285 form factor , which cancels in the tcpv measurement .",
    "thus , tcpv in @xmath284 mode provides a fundamental measure of possible np at a future high luminosity b factory .",
    "the measurement of @xmath286 is known to be difficult .",
    "we have now over @xmath288 @xmath10s , but we still have not extracted @xmath289 convincingly with the so - called @xmath290 method .",
    "the idea of the @xmath290 method is that @xmath291 decay can proceed via two paths : @xmath292 via @xmath293 , and @xmath294 via @xmath295 .",
    "while the former is cabibbo suppressed and proportional to @xmath296 , the latter is both doubly cabibbo suppressed and color suppressed , and proportional to @xmath297 . if @xmath298 and @xmath299 decay to a common final state , the two amplitudes can interfere and probe the relative cpv phase @xmath289 between @xmath300 and @xmath301 .",
    "the trouble is that one has to measure very small branching ratios , controlled by the product @xmath302 , where @xmath303 is the poorly known color suppression factor .    in the so - called glw ( or @xmath304 ) method,@xcite one studies @xmath305 decay to a @xmath0 eigenstate , such as @xmath135 .",
    "the interference effect is between a large and a small amplitude , hence the effect is also small . in the so - called ads method,@xcite one studies @xmath305 decay to a flavor specific final state such as @xmath137 . in this way",
    ", one brings down the @xmath21 amplitude by selecting cabibbo suppressed @xmath306 decay , thereby enhancing the interference effect .",
    "both methods have been studied by belle and babar , but so far they amount to limits on @xmath307 and are not yet fruitful .",
    "one interesting method was developed@xcite recently involving three - body decays common to @xmath299 and @xmath298 , such as @xmath308 .",
    "since this method uses information from the dalitz plot ( including resonance phases ) , it is called the @xmath290 dalitz plot analysis .",
    "denote the @xmath309 amplitude as @xmath310 , where @xmath311 are the dalitz variables .",
    "the corresponding amplitude for @xmath312 is therefore @xmath313 .",
    "thus , for @xmath314 decay , the amplitude is @xmath315 where @xmath146 is the relative strong phase between the @xmath21 and @xmath22 amplitudes .",
    "belle made the first study by modelling @xmath310 with known resonances , which was followed by babar .",
    "the extracted results are@xcite @xmath316 where the last error is from @xmath310 modelling .",
    "although the @xmath286 values are consistent , belle finds a larger @xmath307 than babar , which is partially reflected in the statistical error .",
    "belle has updated with 275 m @xmath31 pairs , finding@xcite @xmath317 these results are consistent with ckm fit results.@xcite note that , with a much larger dataset , the model dependence can be removed by using a binned fit@xcite over the dalitz plot .",
    "search for dcpv in @xmath10 system is important , since a variant of the superweak model could be operative .",
    "it is remarkable that dcpv in @xmath318 was observed already in 2004 , just 3 years after observation of mixing - dependent cpv .    unlike mixing - dependent cpv where one needs",
    "decay time information and tagging , the experimental study of dcpv is much simpler .",
    "they are just counting experiments , and in the self - tagging modes such as @xmath319 , one simply counts the difference between the number of events in @xmath137 vs. @xmath320 .",
    "indications for a negative dcpv in @xmath318 mode , defined as @xmath321 ( basically the same definition as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sfaf ] ) ) have been around for a couple of years .",
    "babar announced a value@xcite with 4.2@xmath117 significance just before ichep 2004 , followed by belle measurement@xcite with 3.9@xmath117 significance .",
    "the results are , @xmath322 combining to @xmath323 with 5.7@xmath117 significance .",
    "this establishes dcpv in @xmath10 system .",
    "the qcd factorization approach predicted the opposite sign,@xcite while the pqcd factorization approach@xcite predicted the correct sign and magnitude .",
    "thus , the measurement has implications for the theory of hadronic @xmath10 decays .",
    "a tantalizing hint for new physics was uncovered by belle,@xcite and supported@xcite by babar . by isospin one",
    "expects @xmath324 in the @xmath325 mode and @xmath326 in the @xmath327 mode to be very similar",
    ". however , belle and babar find @xmath328 combining to @xmath329 , which deviates from @xmath330 by 3.6@xmath117 .",
    "if this result persists , it would imply np in electroweak penguins ( mediated by @xmath331 boson ) , which break isospin .",
    "however , the previous babar measurement@xcite with 88 m @xmath332 mesons gave @xmath333 . while consistent with zero , the sign is opposite eq .",
    "( [ eqn : akpi0babar04 ] ) .",
    "note further that , for @xmath334 mode , we have@xcite @xmath335 though averaging@xcite to @xmath336 , belle and babar do not agree in sign .",
    "thus , it is not yet clear whether @xmath326 and @xmath337 have settled , although the @xmath338 deviation should certainly be watched closely in the near future .",
    "we have left out many other highlights from the b factories , such as the @xmath339 polarization puzzle , observation of @xmath340 and @xmath341 , new hadron states , etc .",
    "we chose to focus on significant cpv results from the b factories .",
    "it is clear that tcpv in @xmath229 modes are now firmly established , with good agreement between belle and babar .",
    "what is surprising is that , while belle and babar have each made impressive tcpv measurements in @xmath135 , @xmath237 and @xmath231 modes , agreement has not been reached in any of these modes ! just compare figs . 3 and 4 with fig .",
    "2 . the statistics may be still insufficient , and perhaps some algorithmic improvements need to be made , since the charmless modes are not background free .",
    "we expect the @xmath135 study to converge in a year or two , but an isospin analysis may need a couple more years for @xmath77 measurement to become more precise . alternatively , if belle completes the @xmath195 and/or @xmath194 studies and concur with the babar findings , then the b factories could claim the measurement of @xmath342 in a year or so",
    ". however , at this point one can not rule out further conflicts to develop .",
    "the current 3.8@xmath117 deviation between @xmath19 measured from penguin @xmath5 modes vs. @xmath229 is significant , and possibly hints at new physics .",
    "but belle and babar disagree on the key @xmath237 and @xmath231 modes .",
    "these two modes ( as well as the higher statistics @xmath266 mode ) may take several years to clear up as one needs a few times more data . other modes would have to wait even longer , and modes like @xmath282 would probably have to await the super b factory with an order of magnitude or more increase in luminosity .",
    "the @xmath286 measurement using @xmath290 dalitz analysis looks promising . in a few years it would become systematics limited , and at the super b factory",
    "one can use the model independent binned fitting approach .",
    "direct cpv has been established in @xmath318 mode .",
    "we expect a few more measurements to appear in next few years , such as in @xmath135 , @xmath207 , and maybe @xmath343 , @xmath344 and @xmath345 .",
    "if the @xmath338 difference persists , which may be known within a year , then we may have new physics in electroweak penguins .",
    "we conclude that , before lhc starts to produce physics , we expect @xmath342 and @xmath286 to be measured , and ckm unitarity can be checked by direct measurement to some accuracy .",
    "if new physics effect is at the 20% level or more for tcpv in penguin @xmath5 modes , it would be discovered .",
    "however , we may know in a year or two whether we have new physics in the electroweak penguin .",
