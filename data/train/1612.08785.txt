    "are many works for designing spreading sequences to improve ds - cdma systems @xcite , which is one of the multiple access systems @xcite . in communication systems , it is important to increase their capacity @xcite to send information with high - rate .",
    "it is necessary and sufficient for achieving the spectral efficiency to increase the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) @xcite",
    ". bit error rate ( ber ) is also important index and it shows the quality of communication systems .",
    "it is known that ber becomes smaller when snr becomes higher @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to increase snr for communication systems .",
    "the current spreading sequences are the gold codes @xcite . as the works for designing ones , we refer the reader to @xcite-@xcite . their approaches to obtain spreading sequences are to design the system which generates sequences .",
    "however , it is not known what is necessary for systems to generate spreading sequences whose snr is high .",
    "therefore , it is not straightforward to design the desired systems .    our approach to design spreading sequences is to derive directly them as the solutions of optimizing problems : maximize snr .",
    "thus , our method has the advantage that our spreading sequences are guaranteed to have high snr since they are the solutions of the problems .",
    "in particular , our optimization problems belong to non - linear programming problems @xcite .",
    "non - linear programming has been developed and used for solving different problems .",
    "the necessary conditions for the global solution of a non - linear programming problem is known as the karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) condition @xcite .",
    "there are many methods to solve numerically non - linear programming problems , for example @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our optimization problems have parameters @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 which are corresponding to autocorrelation and crosscorrelation , that is , faded signal and interference noise , respectively .",
    "thus , we can design flexibly spreading sequences with changing the parameters .",
    "the spreading sequences which are the solutions of the problems have resistance to fading effects when @xmath2 becomes large and ones have resistance to interference noise when @xmath0 @xmath1 becomes large .",
    "this result is shown as the numerical result .    in part",
    "i @xcite , we have derived the new expression of snr . with this expression ,",
    "we construct two types of optimization problems : maximize the lower bound of the average of snr and maximize minimum snr in all the users . with our expression",
    ", we can numerically solve the problems and obtain the solutions .",
    "in general , there are relations between snr and mean - square correlation @xcite @xcite .",
    "thus , we evaluate the solutions with two factors , mean - square correlations and maximum mean - square correlations and discuss the relation between our two types optimization problems and the factors .",
    "in part i @xcite , we have shown how to decompose spreading sequences and derived the new expression of snr .",
    "let @xmath3 be the spreading sequence of the user @xmath4 which is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the length of spreading sequences and @xmath7 is the transpose of @xmath8 .",
    "we decompose the spreading sequence @xmath3 as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the basis vector whose @xmath11-th component is expressed as @xmath12 @xmath13 is an unit imaginary number , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the complex coefficients . note that the each of vectors @xmath16 and @xmath17 is orthogonal with respect to different @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 are obtained from @xmath3 .",
    "then , the lower bound of snr is written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the coefficients of faded signal term and interference noise term , respectively , @xmath23 is the number of users , @xmath24 is the common power of the carrier signals , @xmath25 is the duration of one symbol and @xmath26 is the power of additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) .",
    "the equality is attained if the covariance function of the fading random process , @xmath27 is the rectangular function , which is the worst case that the variance of the faded signal term is maximized .",
    "in this section , our goal is to derive necessary conditions for the optimal spreading sequence which maximizes snr for the case where the @xmath27 is the worst . here , the parameters @xmath6 , @xmath23 , @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 are fixed .",
    "we treat @xmath0 as the weights among all the users .",
    "we ignore the gaussian noise term since it has no relation to spreading sequences . to maximize the lower bound of snr of the user @xmath28",
    ", we should minimize the first term of the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : snr ] ) .",

    "the last constraint term is a signal power constraint .",
    "as can be seen in @xcite , this constraint is obtained from the condition that @xmath38 in the problem @xmath29 , we take into account only the user @xmath28 .",
