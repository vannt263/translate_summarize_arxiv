    "<S> the origin of the hidden - order phase transition has been a long - standing mystery in condensed matter physics . here , based on a first - principles theoretical approach , we examine the complete set of multipole correlations allowed in this material . </S>",
    "<S> the results uncover that the hidden - order parameter is a rank-5 multipole ( dotriacontapole ) order with ` nematic ' @xmath4 symmetry , which exhibits staggered pseudospin moments along the [ 110 ] direction . </S>",
    "<S> this naturally provides comprehensive explanations of all key features in the hidden - order phase including anisotropic magnetic excitations , nearly degenerate antiferromagnetic - ordered state , and spontaneous rotational - symmetry breaking . *    = 10000    in the rare - earth and actinide compounds , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5-electrons behave like well - localized moments at high temperatures . as the temperature </S>",
    "<S> is lowered , @xmath5-electrons begin to delocalize due to the hybridization with conduction electron wavefunctions . at yet lower temperatures the @xmath5-electrons become itinerant , forming a narrow conduction band with heavy effective electron mass , which is largely enhanced from the free - electron mass . </S>",
    "<S> notable many - body effects within the narrow band lead to a plethora of fascinating physical phenomena including multipole order , quantum phase transition and unconventional superconductivity . among them , perhaps the appearance of a ` hidden - order ' ( ho ) state in uru@xmath1si@xmath1 is one of the most mysterious phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> identification of the microscopic order parameter and mechanism that derives the ho transition continue to be a central question in the strongly correlated @xmath5-electron systems .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several unique features that appear to be clues for understanding the ho in uru@xmath1si@xmath1 . in the paramagnetic state above @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> , the magnetic susceptibility exhibits the ising - like anisotropy @xcite . in the ho state below @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> , an electronic excitation gap is formed on a large portion of the fermi surface ( fs ) @xcite and most of the carriers disappear @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> closely related to this , the gap formation also occurs in the magnetic excitation spectra at commensurate and incommensurate wave numbers , @xmath7 = ( 0 0 1 ) and @xmath8 = ( 0.6 0 0 ) , respectively , as revealed by the neutron inelastic scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ho ground state changes to the large - moment antiferromagnetic ( afm ) state with the ordering vector @xmath7 upon applying hydrostatic pressure @xcite , but the fs has a striking similarity between these different phases @xcite , implying that the ho is nearly degenerate with the afm order . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic torque measurements reveal the ` nematicity ' , which breaks the in - plane rotational ( tetragonal ) symmetry in the ho @xcite . the challenge for the theory has been to identify the order parameter which explains all the above key features .    </S>",
    "<S> the theories that have been proposed to describe the ho state can be divided into two prevailing approaches ; one is based on the localized 5@xmath5-electron model and the other the itinerant one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent angle - resolved - photoemission - spectroscopy results clearly demonstrate that all 5@xmath5 electrons are itinerant @xcite and the crystalline electric field , which is a signature of the localized nature , has never been observed . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements @xcite show a formation of the coherent heavy - electron state well above @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is natural to discuss the electronic structure based on the itinerant picture . </S>",
    "<S> however , reliable calculation of the physical quantities by taking into account the complicated band structure is a difficult task . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we use a state - of - the - art _ ab initio _ downfolding @xcite and dissect the electronic structure obtained from the density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained tight - binding hamiltonian is constructed from 56 orbitals of u 5@xmath5 , u @xmath9 , ru @xmath10 and si @xmath11 . introducing the on - site coulomb interactions between 5@xmath5-electrons , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a realistic itinerant model , i.e. 56-band anderson - lattice model including the spin - orbit interaction . </S>",
    "<S> based on this realistic model hamiltonian , magnetic and multipole correlations are analyzed by the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) and beyond . to account for the mass renormalization effect in the fermi - liquid theory , the energy and temperature scale is reduced by a factor of 10 @xcite throughout this study , which makes comparisons to the experiments straightforward .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  1 displays the paramagnetic fs and the band structure near the fermi level , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the energy bands crossing the fermi level have mainly the total angular momentum @xmath12 multiplet of u @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> each @xmath14 component of @xmath12 multiplet is weighed by color . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that each separated fs is mainly composed of a rather specific @xmath14 component without large mixing , except for the outer fs around @xmath15 point ( fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a @xmath14 component map is quite useful in that we are able to capture valuable information such as which parts of the fs play an essential role for the ho formation . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the disentanglement of fs orbital characters has also been an important theoretical advance to understand the electronic properties in iron - pnictide superconductors @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> first we discuss the rpa analysis of rank-1 ( dipole ) correlation , which is the conventional static magnetic correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the regime with @xmath16 shown by red in outer fs around @xmath15 point is well nested with outer fs around @xmath17 point by the vector @xmath7 as indicated by the arrow in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this nesting gives rise to a sharp peak of the correlation parallel to the @xmath18 axis ( dipole @xmath19 ) at @xmath15 ( 0 0 1 ) shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2*a*. another salient feature is the hump structure at around ( 0.6 0 0 ) and the equivalent points , whose @xmath20-vectors coincide with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that these peak and hump structures in the paramagnetic phase are directly related to the magnetic excitation gap at @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the ho phase @xcite because the gap opening occurs at the nested parts of the fs . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the in - plane magnetic correlations , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , are not enhanced in contrast to @xmath19 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2*b * ) , which is also consistent with the ising - like magnetic susceptibility @xcite and polarized - neutron measurements @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> next we examine the higher - rank multipole correlations . according to the group theory , there are 36 multipole moments up to the fifth rank in @xmath12 subspace ( table s1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> figures  2 * c*-*f * depict the correlations between the basis functions belonging to rank-2 ( quadrupole ) , 3 ( octupole ) , 4 ( hexadecapole ) and 5 ( dotriacontapole ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> what is remarkable is that similar to the dipole @xmath19 , the @xmath7 correlation at @xmath15-point is strongly enhanced in some cases such as @xmath23 ( rank-2 ) , @xmath24 ( rank-4 ) , @xmath25 ( rank-5 ) , etc . </S>",
    "<S> generally , these bases are mixed in the tetragonal symmetry , as shown by finite off - diagonal terms ( red lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> the multipole correlations obtained by the diagonalization is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2*g * , in which each correlation at @xmath7 is classified by the irreducible representations and the dominant component is denoted in parentheses . at low temperatures , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 symmetries </S>",
    "<S> exhibit the first , second and third strongest enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> the former and the latter two correspond to the afm and dotriacontapole states , respectively . within the rpa </S>",
    "<S> , the afm state always overcomes the dotriacontapole states . to go beyond the rpa , </S>",
    "<S> we take into account the mode - mode coupling by including the maki - thompson type vertex corrections . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the maximum eigenvalue @xmath29 of the bethe - salpeter equation for a staggered particle - hole pairing with use of the rpa result as the kernel . at @xmath30 , </S>",
    "<S> a phase transition occurs from the paramagnetic to the corresponding eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> temperature dependence of @xmath29 of each symmetry is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3*a*. as the temperature is lowered , @xmath29 of @xmath27 is most strongly enhanced and the condition @xmath30 is fulfilled at finite temperature , indicating a phase transition to the @xmath27 state . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that @xmath27 symmetry breaks the in - plane fourfold symmetry , which naturally accounts for the ` nematicity ' observed in the magnetic torque results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath27 state breaks the time reversal symmetry , which is consistent with the nmr measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these lead us to conclude that the ho is @xmath27 dotriacontapole order .    </S>",
    "<S> the present calculations also reproduce well other key features of the ho , i.e. near degeneracy of the ho and afm states and the anisotropic temperature dependence of the uniform susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3*a * demonstrates that @xmath29 of @xmath27 is very close to that of @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that both states are nearly degenerate and small perturbation can change the ho to afm state . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we can construct a phase diagram by tuning the interactions @xcite , which is consistent with the pressure - temperature phase diagram ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3*b * ) . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the uniform susceptibility @xmath31 parallel to the @xmath18 axis exhibits a broad maximum at around 40k , whilst @xmath32 perpendicular to the @xmath18 axis is smaller and nearly temperature independent ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3*c * ) , in good agreement with experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the low - temperature decrease of @xmath31 arises from the deep dip structure in the density of states ( dos ) near the fermi level ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s1*b * ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ising - like susceptibility including its temperature dependence has been discussed in terms of the crystalline electric field excitations of the localized 5@xmath5-electrons so far . </S>",
    "<S> however , the present results demonstrate that the susceptibility can be well accounted for by the itinerant scenario .      </S>",
    "<S> figure  4*a * displays the fs in the ho state , which is calculated by applying the effective multipole field so as to open the gap of 4  mev observed by the scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice doubling in the afm phase with @xmath7 also occurs in the ho phase . </S>",
    "<S> most part of the fs having @xmath16 components disappears as a result of the gap opening at the nested parts of the paramagnetic fs . around the @xmath17-point , a small electron and a large hole ( @xmath50 ) pockets , </S>",
    "<S> the fs with a cage - like structure and four electron pockets ( @xmath52 ) exist . </S>",
    "<S> the fs in the ho phase bears a striking resemblance to that in the afm state , consistent with the quantum oscillation measurements . </S>",
    "<S> however , the broken fourfold symmetry in the ho state can be seen clearly in the fs with cage - like structure ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4*b * ) , in sharp contrast to the afm state @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the present approach based on the first - principles calculation is able to give a comprehensive explanation to the problem of ho , which has been a quarter century mystery . why has the ho been hidden for a long time ? </S>",
    "<S> the reason appears to be that the order parameter of the present high - rank multipole state is extremely difficult to detect directly by the conventional experimental techniques , such as resonant x - ray and neutron measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the _ itinerant _ multipole ordering with ` nematicity ' revealed in the present study is a new type of electron ordering , which is expected to be ubiquitously present in the strongly correlated electron systems@xcite when spin and orbital degrees of freedom are entangled .    </S>",
