    "interstellar li was first detected in the early 1970 s ( traub & carleton 1973 ) . since then",
    "there have been relatively few reported observations of interstellar li  i. the early detections ( traub & carleton 1973 ; vanden bout et al . 1978 ; snell & vanden bout 1981 ; hobbs 1984 ; white 1986 ) showed weak interstellar li  i absorption , barely discernible from the noise , with equivalent widths ( @xmath10s ) on the order of at most a few m@xmath11 .",
    "these early observations showed that the interstellar li  i abundance was similar along different lines of sight .",
    "however , large uncertainties remained due to low signal - to - noise ratios and uncertain corrections for ionization and depletion onto grains . with the advent of modern detectors and more sophisticated observing techniques , reliable observations of @xmath0li , and the much weaker @xmath1li line , were possible ( ferlet & dennefeld 1984 ; lemoine et al .",

    "the result is a blend of the @xmath0li and @xmath1li lines ( ferlet & dennefeld 1984 ; sansonetti et al .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the existence of several interstellar clouds along the line of sight ( typically 6 clouds per kpc ) .",
    "for this reason , uhr surveys [ resolving power ( r ) @xmath2 600,000 ] of k  i ( hobbs 1974a , 1974b ; welty & hobbs 2001 ) were used to find lines of sight with simple velocity structure ( that is , one or two components ) with significant amounts ( @xmath24(k  i )  @xmath2  10@xmath8 @xmath25 ) of absorption . assuming a constant k / li ratio ( white 1986 ; welty & hobbs 2001 ) , these surveys yielded lines of sight to pursue in the quest for interstellar li  i absorption .",

    "the oscillator strengths for the li  i hyperfine transitions were extracted from the fine structure oscillator strengths ( e.g. , welty , hobbs , & kulkarni 1994 ) .",

    "this combination of procedures enabled the detection of 1% ccd defects and minimized their effect on the data .",

    "each stellar spectrum was carefully examined for flat field artifacts or cosmic rays before the final spectrum was created .",

    "when the cosmic rays coincided with the interstellar features in a spectrum , as was the case with 3 exposures of @xmath12  oph , 2 exposures of 20  aql and 1 exposure of @xmath3  per , the affected spectra were not included in the final sum .",
    "the standard reduction process was successful in extracting the data for most of the observing runs . while examining the spectra for cosmic rays , the presence of two 1% features ( ccd defects ) that were not removed during the flat fielding process were detected .",
    "an improved flat fielding technique using stellar spectra was applied before the remaining steps in the extraction process .",
    "the defects were seen in all spectra , but for @xmath2 60% of the observing runs the defects were far ( @xmath2 200 pixels ) from where the interstellar line(s ) appeared .",
    "the defects were a problem for the mcdonald observing runs of august 1998 , december 1999 , and december 2000 .",
    "the basic solution followed the prescription for removal of fixed pattern noise in spectra acquired with the goddard high - resolution spectrograph ( cardelli & ebbets 1994 ) .",
    "the spectrum of an unreddened star was used as a template ; removal of the defect was accomplished by dividing the affected spectrum by the template in pixel space , since defects remain fixed in pixel space .",
    "multiple observing runs of the interstellar species toward the same star gave an additional check that proved useful in minimizing the effect of the 1% defects .",

    "2000 ) from lower resolution observations .    if a value of about 12 was the starting condition for the gas toward @xmath3  per , the decrease in the ratio to its present value requires an increase in the li abundance by an order of magnitude .",
    "however , an enhancement in the total li abundance is not seen .",
    "the elemental k / li ratio for this gas is not unusual either , although k and li are produced via different nucleosynthetic pathways .",
    "the most likely scenario for the ism toward @xmath3  per is that the initial li was enhanced through gcr spallation reactions occurring as a result of recent supernovae grouped in a superbubble .",
    "the cloud containing a low isotope ratio contains about 20% of the total li content of the clouds .",
    "therefore , determination of a total li abundance may mask the true li abundance for each interstellar cloud .",
    "although the supernova scenario explains many of the observations , this hypothesis does not address the similarity of the k / li ratio with results for other sight lines .",
    "fractionation can not account for the low @xmath0li/@xmath1li ratio because the abundance of lih is too small .",
    "there is also evidence for enhanced x - ray activity in the cluster ic  348 caused by stellar flares in t tauri stars ( preibisch et al .",
    "1996 ) . while @xmath1li can be produced during stellar flares ( e.g. , deliyannis & malaney 1995 ; ramaty et al .",
    "2000b ) , the enhanced flaring activity in ob associations was found to play a negligible role .",
    "more typical @xmath0li/@xmath1li ratios can be obtained through the inclusion of extra velocity components that are detected in na  i absorption at 5895   but not seen in k  i absorption at 7699 @xmath11 , although this comes at the expense of highly disparate na  i / li  i and k  i / li  i ratios . therefore , the exceptional isotopic ratio toward @xmath3  per remains a puzzle .",
    "further observations of other stars in or near ic  348 are needed to probe the extent of the region containing a low @xmath0li/@xmath1li ratio .",
    "observations were made of x  per , a nearby x - ray binary .",
    "it is believed that x  per and other x - ray binary systems are formed after a supernova explosion ( e.g. , delgado - mart et al .",
    "the direction toward x  per shows almost an order of magnitude smaller li and k abundances than toward other sight lines .",
    "these smaller abundances suggest enhanced depletion along the los .",
    "unfortunately , the snr of the x  per spectrum was too low to allow a useful probe of the region containing the low isotope ratio .    the stars in sco ob2 were studied since they closely matched the situation present toward @xmath3  per .",
    "these stars are in an ob association where star formation is occurring in the @xmath17 oph molecular cloud .",
    "there is evidence of a past supernova because @xmath12 oph is a runaway star ( hoogerwerf et al .",
    "why is there no evidence for enhanced @xmath1li production in the presence of active star formation ( @xmath17  oph molecular cloud ) and past sn  ii explosions ? is the los toward @xmath3  per really that rare ?",
    "more observations are necessary to determine if we are experiencing a selection effect ; to date , only three sight lines in each ob association have been studied with sufficient precision .",
    "an additional result of our study involves the los toward 20  aql , which resides far from active star - forming regions .",
    "the @xmath0li/@xmath1li ratio is similar to the solar system value , but the k / li ratio is almost double the expected value . the k / h abundance is similar to the abundance found for other sight lines , indicating that there is less li .",
    "the los toward 20  aql lies on the edge of radio loop i ( hayakawa et al .",
    "1979 ; sembach , savage , tripp 1997 ) , a superbubble",
    ". however , the timescale needed to destroy li through proton burning is significantly longer than the age of bubble .",
    "another explanation is required to account for the low li / h abundance .",
    "the low li abundance toward 20  aql could be evidence for li dilution in an old superbubble ( parizot & drury 1999 ; knauth et al .",
    "observations of li  i and k  i toward other stars in the vicinity of 20  aql are necessary to gain further insight .",
    "we place additional interstellar constraints on the @xmath0li produced by a stellar source .",
    "our results indicate that there is essentially a constant production of @xmath0li in stars in the solar neighborhood , suggesting one or two processes dominate .",
    "observations of interstellar and stellar @xmath0li , s - process , and r - process elements can be of great value in constraining the li production by the various stellar sources .    for future studies of interstellar li , knowledge of the k  i abundance in conjunction with the molecular content",
    "can be used to find sight lines that contain observable amounts of li .",
    "for instance , the results of this survey suggest other targets in sco ob2 .",
    "these stars , which are fainter than x  per , can be observed at lower resolving power ( r @xmath2 180,000 ) because their interstellar spectra reveal simple velocity structure .",
    "preliminary results for these stars indicate that the @xmath0li/@xmath1li ratios are similar to the solar system value .",
    "thus , lines of sight with low @xmath0li/@xmath1li ratios appear to be rare . observations of stars in the vicinity of ic  348 ( in per ob2 ) are planned to help clarify the picture for gas toward @xmath3  per .",
    "in addition , data from the @xmath99 on the interstellar @xmath8b/@xmath7b ratio toward stars in per ob2 are being analyzed .",
    "the interstellar abundance of @xmath6be and the @xmath8b/@xmath7b ratio ( hebrard et al . 1997 ; lambert et al .",
    "1998 ) are crucial to our understanding of li evolution .",
    "knowledge of @xmath6be and @xmath7b further constrain the amount of gcr spallation occurring along the line of sight , since gcr spallation is the only production route for these light elements .",
    "observations of interstellar @xmath6be are not yet feasible because its gas phase abundance is extremely low ( @xmath6be / h @xmath100 7 @xmath43 10@xmath101 ; hebrard et al .",
    "the amount of @xmath8b also yields constraints on sn  ii explosions because about 50% of @xmath8b is thought to arise from neutrino - induced spallation reactions ( woosley et al .",
    "1990 ; woosley & weaver 1995 ) . only through a more complete study of the abundances for a variety of atomic species will the light element puzzle be resolved .",
    "the mcdonald observatory data presented here formed the basis for david knauth s ph.d .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the excellent staff at mcdonald observatory , especially david doss , for assistance with the instrumental setup .",
    "we also thank jnos zsarg for the use of his code .",
