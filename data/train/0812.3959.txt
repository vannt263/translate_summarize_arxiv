    "quantum entanglement is an important physical resource in quantum information and computation tasks such as quantum teleportation [ 1 ] , quantum key distribution [ 2 ] , quantum computation [ 3 ] and so on . in realistic quantum information processing",
    ", entanglement has to be prepared or distributed beforehand by two distant parties in which one or more physical systems have to be transmitted by a quantum channel .",
    "however , unlike classical systems , quantum systems are usually fragile .",
    "it is inevitable that environment ( channel ) will influence the systems of interest more or less and induce decoherence because of the interaction with the systems , so that entanglement is destroyed to some extent before use [ 4 - 6 ] .",
    "it is a key task to evaluate the shared entanglement after the influence of environment .",
    "in usual one has to deduce the time evolution of entanglement of the composite system from the time evolution of the quantum state under consideration [ 7 ] , when the subsystems of the composite quantum system undergo a physical process .",
    "that is to say , for the different potential initial states one has to repeat the same procedure every time .",
    "quite recently , an important step has been taken by konrad et al [ 8 ] who provided an explicit evolution equation of quantum entanglement quantified by the remarkable concurrence [ 9 ] for bipartite quantum state of qubits .",
    "it has been shown that given any one - sided quantum channel , the concurrence of output state corresponding to any initial pure input state of interests can always be equivalently obtained by the product of the concurrence of input state and that of the output state with the maximally entangled state as an input state . however , for two - sided quantum channel or the initial mixed states , the product of the two concurrences only provides an upper bound for the concurrence of interests .",
    "it is obviously important to find a lower bound of the concurrence in order to well grasp the entanglement of output states .",
    "in fact , quantum mechanics and quantum information processing ( qip ) are not constrained to pure states as well as @xmath0 dimensional quantum systems .",
    "because of imperfect experiments and inevitable disturbance of environments , mixed ( entangled ) states are ubiquitous , which is inevitable for qip to cope with .",
    "furthermore , on the one hand , when we face the quantum features , especially entanglement , of meso- even macroscopic quantum systems , such as bose - einstein condensates [ 10 ] .",
    "we have to deal with high dimensional density matrices .",
    "on the other hand , it has been shown that some qip tasks based on high dimensional entangled states are more efficient than those of qubits .",
    "for example , cryptographic protocols are more secure based on quantum channel of qutrits [ 11 - 13 ] .",
    "teleportation can be implemented in faith even though a non - maximally entangled quantum channel is shared [ 14 ] .",
    "therefore , for these large systems , it is necessary to investigate the entanglement of high dimensional quantum systems ( multi - parties included ) .",
    "however , quantification of entanglement , as a precondition of studying entanglement , is generally a hard problem which does not only lie in the poor practicability for high dimensional quantum systems [ 15,16 ] but also the nonlinearity on density matrices for usual entanglement measures [ 17,18 ] .",
    "therefore , it is often suggested to derive a lower bound to evaluate the entanglement ( entanglement can be better evaluated , if both upper and lower bounds are given ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider the evolution of entanglement with either ( or both ) subsystem undergoing an arbitrary quantum channel . _ with concurrence as entanglement measure",
    ", we find a lower bound of the concurrence of any output states for a given quantum channel based on the evolution of a probe state as input states_. it is shown that our lower bound is not restricted to the bipartite systems of qubits . in particular , for one - sided quantum channel , our lower bound has a concise form . furthermore , we also show that it is not necessary to choose the maximally entangled state as the probe states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give a lower bound for the concurrence of bipartite quantum systems ; in sec .",
    "iii , we show that the lower bound can be obtained in terms of the initial input state and the output state with the probe state as initial states ; the conclusion is drawn finally .",
