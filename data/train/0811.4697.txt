    "in data hiding , a very old field named steganography is used since the antiquity . as defined by cox  _ et al . _",

    "cox  @xcite defines the warden as active when  _ she intentionally modifies the content sent by alice prior to receipt by bob _ \" .",
    "these modifications can slightly modify the content and degrade the hidden information . in this work ,",
    "we consider that all modifications performed by wendy are modeled by an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) and we propose to study the limits of such systems . since our specific active warden context is similar to the case of watermarking with awgn channel , we propose to study the capacity according to the shannon definition  @xcite as the maximum information bits that can be embedded in one sample subject to certain level of the active warden attack ( an awgn attack in this case ) . in sequel , we evaluate the statistical undetectability by the kullback - leibler distance ( kld ) between the probability density functions ( p.d.f . ) of the stego - signal and the cover - signal , since the warden detects the message by comparing the stego - document probability density function with that of the cover - document . in  @xcite , author used kld to evaluate the security of stego - systems in the context of the passive warden . in this work , cachin s security criterion",

    "proposed to make it undetectable is the use of a specific compressor on the signal leads to a less flexible scheme .",
    "le  guelvouit  @xcite proposed to use trellis - coded quantization ( tcq ) in order to hide the message : the author shows experimentally that the p.d.f . of the stego - signal",

    "we fully complete this study and also theoretically demonstrate this result .",
    "moreover , we propose in this work an evaluation of steganographic performance in an active warden context of the spread transform scalar costa scheme ( st - scs )  @xcite , which is often use for robust watermarking .",

    "the second one is based on the combination of scs with spread transform ( the st - scs ) , which allows a good statistical undetectability and a best compromise between capacity and undetectability . in future work , we shall study an improvement of the undetectability with combination of st and tcq when the projection parameter is public .",
