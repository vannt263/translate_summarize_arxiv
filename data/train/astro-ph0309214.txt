    "understanding the properties and evolution of the gas and dust content in nearby ir luminous galaxies is essential for understanding the cause and temporal evolution of starburst activity and its role in the cosmic evolution of galaxies .",
    "therefore , there is a need to investigate large statistical samples of ir luminous galaxies using a multitude of different types of data , including co , h i , and continuum in the submillimeter ( sub - mm ) , fir and radio , in order to constrain theories of how the interstellar medium ( ism ) evolves . millimeter and submillimeter",
    "co rotational lines are often used as tracers of molecular hydrogen .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0co(3 - 2 ) to ( 1 - 0 ) line emission provides more sensitive measure of gas temperature and density than the ratio of @xmath0co(2 - 1 ) to ( 1 - 0 ) lines .",
    "recently , we have presented the largest statistical co survey ( yao et al .",
    "2003 ) for the nearby universe by investigating the properties of co molecular gas in a nearly complete subsample of 60 ir luminous galaxies selected from the slugs survey ( dunne et al .",
    "the slugs survey containing 104 galaxies is based on the revised bright galaxy sample of _ iras _ galaxies ( soifer et al .",
    "1987 ) within -10@xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath16 + 50@xmath15 and with @xmath18 @xmath2 1900 km s@xmath19 , a flux limit of @xmath20 @xmath2 5.24 jy , and the fir luminosity @xmath3 @xmath2 10@xmath5 l@xmath6 .",
    "a study of molecular gas of a complete flux - limited subsample is important to complement the study of the dust . the angular resolution of the @xmath0co(1 - 0 ) and ( 3 - 2 )",
    "point observations presented in our co survey are nearly identical ( @xmath7 15@xmath21@xmath21 ) . a complete discussion of the observations , the co line spectra , and the data analysis is contained in yao et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and references therein . together with the sub - mm fluxes ( dunne et al .",
    "2000 ) , plus existing data on h i ( thomas et al . 2002 ) , radio continuum ( condon et al . 1990 ) , and fir ( dunne et al . 2000 ; ned ) , we are able to search for a relationship between the degree of excitation of the co in this sample and the star forming properties .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows a comparison between the co and fir luminosities for two different fir color regimes .",
    "a linear fit to the 1 - 0 data in the log - log plane yields log@xmath22 = ( 0.2 @xmath23 0.7 ) + ( 0.57 @xmath23 0.07 ) log@xmath24 . the nonlinear variation of @xmath10 with @xmath3 implies a decrease in the ratio @xmath10/@xmath3 with increasing @xmath3 , so that more ir luminous galaxies have higher dust temperatures and star formation efficiency . no correlation with the projected beam size on the galaxies is evident .",
    "the ratio depends intrinsically on the total fir luminosity .",
    "this implies that for high-@xmath25 objects where @xmath3 is exceedingly high , the corresponding @xmath10 will be seriously overestimated if a linear relation between @xmath10 and @xmath3 is assumed .",
    "we examined the excitation of co and its relation with the properties of gas / dust and star formation in the the central starburst regions in the slugs sample .",
    "there are no significant correlations between the @xmath0co(3 - 2 ) to ( 1 - 0 ) line ratio @xmath9 and the distance of galaxies , star formation rate , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , h@xmath11 gas mass , and the color indices .",
    "this might reflect a range of localized conditions in the molecular clouds .",
    "but the degree of co excitation measured by @xmath9 varies greatly from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "there is a trend for the @xmath9 to increase with increasing concentration and efficiency of star - forming activity ( see figure 1 ( b ) ) .",
    "the saturation of @xmath9 seen at higher sfe implies that the gas is denser and warmer in regions of higher sfe , which is consistent with the nonlinearity between @xmath10 and @xmath3 .      our co line measurements , together with dust and co isotope data taken from the literature ( dunne et al . 2000",

    "1999 ) , are modeled using the lvg approximation yielding @xmath12 = @xmath28 ( see figure 1 ( c ) and ( d ) ) to estimate that the controversial @xmath12 lies between 1.3@xmath2910@xmath30 and 6.7@xmath2910@xmath30 cm@xmath14(k km s@xmath19)@xmath19 for slugs galaxies , which is about 4 - 20 times lower than the conventional @xmath12 factor derived from the galaxy .",
    "the mean value 2.7@xmath2910@xmath30 is comparable to that estimated from diffuse clouds in the galaxy and with that found for extreme starbursts in nearby galaxies .      using virial analysis",
    ", we show that the molecular clouds in starburst regions are not gravitationally bound , confirming the suggestion recently made by zhu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the antennae galaxies , unless one is willing to accept a 9 - 90 times lower [ co / h@xmath11 ] abundance ratio .",
    "the cause could be the destruction by the stellar winds and expanding shells of newborn massive stars .",
    "most of the co line emission originates from the nonvirialized warm and diffuse gas clouds .",
    "our @xmath0co(3 - 2 ) observations provide an important database for correcting the scuba 850 @xmath33 m data in the slugs sample ( see figure 1 ( e ) and ( f ) ) , thus permitting a revised characterization of the masses of dust and gas ( see seaquist et al .",
    "the average downward correction of dust mass is 25 - 38% , which has no bearing on earlier conclusions concerning the shapes of the dust mass - luminosity function derived from slugs survey . using the @xmath0co(3 - 2)/(1 - 0 ) ratios in yao et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we estimate that it is unlikely that any correction is required for the contribution by @xmath0co(6 - 5 ) to 450 @xmath33 m fluxes of the slugs galaxies measured with scuba .",
    "the revised mean gas - to - dust ratio ( g / d ) is reduced from 310 to 100 , which is significantly lower than those reported for the global g / d ratios for ir luminous galaxies .",
