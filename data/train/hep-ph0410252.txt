    "there exists a great variety of structures for the superstring / m theory vacua , the ensemble of which is called the stringy `` landscape ''  @xcite . with the `` weak anthropic principle ''  @xcite , this proposal may not only give the first concrete explanation of the very tiny value of the cosmological constant which can only take discrete values , but also solve the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "in particular , the supersymmetry breaking scale can be high if there exist many supersymmetry breaking parameters or many hidden sectors  @xcite .",
    "although there is no definite conclusion that the string landscape predicts high - scale or tev - scale supersymmetry breaking  @xcite , it is interesting to study models with high - scale supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "if supersymmetry is indeed broken at a high scale , the breaking scale can range from 1 tev to the string scale . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider three representative cases : ( 1 )  string - scale supersymmetry breaking , ( 2 )  intermediate - scale supersymmetry breaking , and ( 3 )  tev - scale supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the tev - scale supersymmetry has been studied extensively during the last two decades , so we do not discuss it here .",
    "although the original motivation for the new minimal standard model ( nmsm )  @xcite is different from the above string landscape argument , the nmsm provides a concrete model with string - scale supersymmetry breaking . with only six extra degrees of freedom beyond the minimal standard model ( sm ) , the nmsm incorporates the new discoveries of physics beyond the minimal standard model : dark energy , non - baryonic dark matter , neutrino masses , as well as baryon asymmetry and cosmic inflation , by adopting the principle of minimal particle content and the most general renormalizable lagrangian .",
    "the nmsm is free from excessive flavor - changing effects , cp violation , too - rapid proton decay , problems with electroweak precision data , and unwanted cosmological relics  @xcite .",
    "moreover , gauge coupling unification can be achieved by considering threshold corrections  @xcite , or by introducing suitable additional particles , similar to the axion models with string - scale supersymmetry breaking that will be discussed in section  v. the unitarity constraints on couplings are weaker than the stability and triviality constraints  @xcite .    for high - scale supersymmetry breaking , arkani - hamed and dimopoulos proposed the split supersymmetry scenario where the scalars ( squarks , sleptons and one combination of the scalar higgs doublets ) have masses at an intermediate scale , while the fermions ( gauginos and higgsinos ) and the other combination of the scalar higgs doublets are still at the tev scale  @xcite .",
    "gauge coupling unification is preserved and the lightest neutralino can still be a dark matter candidate .",
    "in addition , most of the problems with supersymmetric models , for example , flavor and cp violations , dimension-5 fast proton decay and the stringent constraints on the lightest higgs mass , are solved .",
    "the consequences of split supersymmetry have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand , unlike the cosmological constant problem and the gauge hierarchy problem , the strong cp problem is still a concern in the string landscape  @xcite . in the standard model ,",
    "the @xmath3 parameter is a dimensionless coupling constant which is infinitely renormalized by radiative corrections .",
    "there is no theoretical reason for @xmath3 to be smaller than @xmath4 as required by the experimental bound on the electric dipole moment of the neutron  @xcite .",
    "there is also no known anthropic constraint on the value of @xmath3 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath3 may be a random variable with a roughly uniform distribution in the string landscape  @xcite .",
    "an elegant and popular solution to the strong cp problem is provided by the peccei ",
    "quinn ( pq ) mechanism  @xcite , in which a global axial symmetry @xmath5 is introduced and broken spontaneously at some high energy scale .",
    "then @xmath6 is promoted to a dynamical field , @xmath7 , with an effective potential for this field induced by non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "the axion @xmath8 is a pseudo - goldstone boson from the spontaneous @xmath5 symmetry breaking , with a decay constant @xmath9 ( of similar scale as the @xmath5 symmetry breaking scale ) .",
    "minimization of the axion potential fixes the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath8 , equivalently forces @xmath6 to be zero , thus naturally solving the strong cp problem .",
    "the original weinberg  wilczek axion  @xcite is excluded by experiment , in particular by the non - observation of the rare decay @xmath10",
    "there are two viable `` invisible '' axion models in which the experimental bounds can be evaded : ( 1 )  the kim ",

    " zakharov ( ksvz ) axion model , which introduces a sm singlet and a pair of extra vector - like quarks that carry @xmath5 charges while the sm fermions and higgs fields are neutral under @xmath5 symmetry  @xcite ; ( 2 )  the dine  fischler ",
    "srednicki  zhitnitskii ( dfsz ) axion model , in which a sm singlet and one pair of higgs doublets are introduced , and the sm fermions and higgs fields are charged under @xmath5 symmetry  @xcite .    from laboratory , astrophysics , and cosmology constraints ,",
    "the @xmath5 symmetry breaking scale @xmath9 is limited to the range @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "light axions can be produced in stars , and part of the star energy can be carried away by these axions . to avoid an unacceptable star energy loss , a lower bound",
    "is obtained on the axion decay constant , @xmath12  gev .",
    "during the course of cosmological evolution of the universe , the axions decouple early and begin to oscillate coherently . if @xmath9 is larger than about @xmath13  gev , at some point in the evolution the energy density in the coherent axion oscillations could exceed the critical energy density and over - close the universe .",
    "the invisible axion can be a good cold dark matter candidate  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the axion models with high - scale supersymmetry breaking .",
    "unlike split supersymmetry , we consider an approximately universal supersymmetry breaking , _",
    "i.e. _ , the mass differences among the squarks , sleptons , gauginos , higgsinos and the @xmath14-terms are within one order of magnitude ( within one - loop suppressions ) , which seems to be quite natural from flux - induced supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "we construct a supersymmetric ksvz axion model where we introduce a sm singlet @xmath15 and two pairs of sm vector - like particles ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) and ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) .",
    "the supersymmetry breaking scale and the peccei ",
    "quinn symmetry breaking scale are both around @xmath20  gev , and the axion can be a cold dark matter candidate .",
    "we give the higgs potential and the sm yukawa couplings below the intermediate scale , the superpotential above the intermediate scale , and the matching conditions for the couplings .",
    "in addition , we consider the discrete @xmath1 peccei ",
    "quinn symmetry , which can be embedded into an anomalous @xmath21 gauge symmetry in string constructions where the anomalies can be cancelled by the green  schwarz mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath1 discrete symmetry can not be violated by the quantum gravitational interaction . in order that the contributions to the @xmath6 term from the non - renormalizable operators can be less than @xmath4",
    ", we must require @xmath22 .",
    "we also show that a suitable quartic coupling for the singlet @xmath15 can be obtained at one - loop due to its large yukawa couplings to the extra vector - like particles .",
    "thus , the intermediate supersymmetry breaking scale is directly connected to the peccei ",
    "quinn symmetry breaking scale .",
    "moreover , using two - loop renormalization group equation runnings for the gauge couplings and one - loop renormalization group equation runnings for the yukawa couplings , we find that gauge coupling unification can be achieved at about @xmath2  gev and the higgs mass range is from 130  gev to 160  gev . also , we calculate the yukawa couplings for the third family of the sm fermions at the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale and comment on how to achieve yukawa coupling unification . in our model ,",
    "similar to the nmsm and split supersymmetry , most of the usual problems in the supersymmetric models are solved .",
    "if the @xmath23-parity is an exact symmetry , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) neutralinos can be produced only non - thermally in a suitable amount , and their annihilations may have cosmological consequences . if @xmath23-parity is broken , the tiny masses and bilarge mixings for active neutrinos can be realized naturally at one - loop although we have to suppress the contributions to neutrino masses from the tree - level @xmath24 terms in the superpotential .",
    "we also briefly discuss other axion models : the dfsz axion model with intermediate - scale supersymmetry breaking where the stabilization of the axion solution and the peccei  quinn symmetry breaking are similar , the axion models with string - scale supersymmetry breaking , and the axion models with split supersymmetry .",
    "we first specify our conventions . we denote the left - handed quark doublets , the right - handed up - type quarks , the right - handed down - type quarks , the left - handed lepton doublets , the right - handed leptons , and the higgs doublet in the standard model as @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , where @xmath31 is the family index . for the supersymmetric standard model ,",
    "the sm fermions and higgs fields are superfields belonging to chiral multiplets .",

    "the sm fermions and higgs fields are assumed to be neutral under the @xmath1 pq symmetry .",

    "their quantum numbers under the sm @xmath41 gauge symmetry and the @xmath1 symmetry are specified in table  [ qnep ] .",
    "the axion potential from the qcd anomaly is generated when we couple the singlet @xmath15 to these extra vector - like particles .",
    "in addition , the charges of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath15 under the @xmath1 symmetry satisfy the relations @xmath42 @xmath43    .",

    "however , after a gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken , there may exist a remnant discrete gauge symmetry which will not be violated by quantum gravity  @xcite .",

    "the most dangerous term is the following hard supersymmetry breaking term in the potential : @xmath122 where @xmath123 can be complex .",
    "this term would induce a non - zero contribution to @xmath6  @xcite of @xmath124 here we assumed that cp violation is of order 1 so that there is no extra fine - tuning in our discussion .    for numerical calculations , we first evaluate @xmath9 .",

    "the above stabilization discussion is generic for supersymmetric axion models because the hard supersymmetry breaking terms can be induced from the non - renormalizable operators in the khler potential after supersymmetry breaking .",
    "for example , in our model we can have the following non - renormalizable operator in the khler potential @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a coupling constant , and @xmath135 is a spurion superfield which parametrizes the supersymmetry breaking via @xmath136 .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the mass scale @xmath137 is equal to the planck scale @xmath77 and @xmath138 is about @xmath20 gev .",

    "thus , how to explain the @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 yukawa couplings at the gut scale remains an interesting problem . this may be solved via flavor symmetry breaking or via particle mixings by introducing additional sm vector - like particles with similar sm quantum numbers .      in our models ,",
    "the gauge coupling unification scale is about @xmath201  gev ; therefore , there is no dimension-6 proton decay problem . due to intermediate - scale supersymmetry breaking , we do not have the dimension-5 proton decay problem , the moduli problem , and the excessive supersymmetry flavor violation and cp violation , etc .",
    "in addition , if we want to explain neutrino masses via the see - saw mechanism  @xcite and baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis  @xcite , we just need to introduce three right - handed neutrinos .",
    "also , the sm fermion masses and mixings can be generated naturally via the froggatt ",
    "nielsen mechanism  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath23-parity is conserved in our model , the lightest supersymmetric particle , for example the neutralino , can not be produced thermally , otherwise the universe will be over - closed .",
    "so we have to require that the reheating temperature be below @xmath39  gev .",
    "however , there is the interesting possibility that the lsp neutralino is produced non - thermally in suitable amount , and may still be a dark matter candidate .",
    "then neutralino annihilation may have cosmological consequences .",
    "if @xmath23-parity is violated , tiny neutrino masses can be generated naturally at one - loop .",
    "however , for naturalness , we have to suppress the tree - level contributions to the neutrino masses from the @xmath24 terms in the superpotential , where @xmath202 must be smaller than 10  gev  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino masses and bilarge mixings deserve further detailed studies .",
    "we now briefly discuss the other axion models with high - scale supersymmetry breaking , where the axion can be the dark matter candidate and the axion solution to the strong cp problem may be stabilized similarly to the discussions in section  [ sec : stab ] .",
    "however , the peccei - quinn symmetry can be broken naturally at about @xmath20 gev if and only if the supersymmetry breaking scale is intermediate .      since we consider approximate universal supersymmetry breaking , _",
    "i.e. _ , the mass differences among the squarks , sleptons , gauginos , higgsinos and the @xmath14-terms are within one order of magnitude ( within one - loop suppressions ) , we must introduce additional particles to achieve gauge coupling unification .",
    "similar to the discussions in section iii , we can introduce two pairs of sm vector - like particles with sm quantum numbers ( ( @xmath101 ) , ( @xmath108 , @xmath103 , @xmath203 ) ) and ( ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath204 ) , ( @xmath108 , @xmath106 , @xmath109 ) ) .",
    "alternatively , we can introduce two chiral multiplets @xmath205 and @xmath206 with quantum numbers ( @xmath207 ) and ( @xmath208 ) , and one pair of the sm vector - like fields with quantum numbers ( ( @xmath106 , @xmath103 , @xmath112 ) , ( @xmath106 , @xmath103 , @xmath113 ) ) .",
    "the masses for these extra particles are around the intermediate scale @xmath20 gev , and gauge coupling unification can be achieved around @xmath209 gev .",
    "the stabilization of the axion solution is similar to that in section iii for the ksvz axion model by introducing a discrete @xmath1 peccei - quinn symmetry and embedding it into the anomalous @xmath21 gauge symmetry , whose anomalies are cancelled by the green  schwarz mechanism . as in section iii , in order to generate the quartic coupling for the singlet @xmath15 , we need to couple @xmath15 to the extra particles .",
    "for example , the superpotential for the additional particles in the second set of fields is @xmath210 where the yukawa couplings @xmath211 and @xmath212 are of order 1 . here",
    "@xmath206 are charged under the @xmath1 or @xmath21 symmetry .",
    "we emphasize that in this model the intermediate supersymmetry breaking scale is still directly related to the peccei  quinn symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the axion models with string - scale supersymmetry breaking are the standard model plus the ksvz or dfsz axion .",
    "there are many ways to achieve gauge coupling unification by introducing various sets of particles with masses from the tev scale to the gut scale . for simplicity",
    ", we only consider the axion model with tev - scale extra fermions whose masses can be protected by the chiral symmetry .",
    "we can introduce two pairs of sm vector - like fermions with quantum numbers ( ( @xmath101 ) , ( @xmath108 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 ) ) and ( ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath204 ) , ( @xmath102 , @xmath106 , @xmath109 ) ) , similar to the extra particle content in ref .  @xcite .",
    "gauge coupling unification can be achieved around @xmath114 gev  @xcite . for the ksvz axion model with the second set of fields",
    ", we need to introduce sm vector - like particles which form complete @xmath71 multiplets and couple to the sm singlet @xmath15 so that we can have the qcd anomalous peccei  quinn symmetry and preserve gauge coupling unification .",
    "the stabilization of the axion solution is similar to that in section iii .",
    "however , we need extra fine - tuning to keep the vev of @xmath15 around @xmath20 gev .      for axion models with split supersymmetry , the stabilization of the axion solution and the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking are similar to those in section iii",
    "if the supersymmetry breaking scale is intermediate , _",
    "i.e. _ , from @xmath39 gev to @xmath13 gev . however , for axion models where the supersymmetry breaking scale is higher than @xmath13 gev or lower than @xmath39 gev , the stabilization of the axion solution is similar to that in section  iii , while how to naturally break the peccei - quinn symmetry deserves further study .    for the ksvz axion model with intermediate - scale supersymmetry breaking",
    ", we can introduce one pair of vector - like fields with @xmath71 quantum numbers @xmath213 and @xmath214 , respectively , that can couple to the singlet @xmath15 via the superpotential @xmath119 . as a result , gauge coupling unification is still preserved , and the stabilization of the axion solution and the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking are the same as those in section iii . for the dfsz axion model with intermediate - scale supersymmetry breaking , we still need to introduce some adjoint or sm vector - like particles which form complete @xmath71 multiplets that couple to the singlet @xmath15 to generate its quartic coupling at one - loop .",
    "there are again two possibilities for the axion models with split supersymmetry : ( 1 )  @xmath23-parity is violated because the lsp neutralino need not be a dark matter candidate at all ; ( 2 )  @xmath23-parity is preserved , and both the lsp neutralino and the axion or dominantly one of them contributes to the dark matter density .",
    "there exists the possibility of high - scale supersymmetry breaking in string compactifications where the cosmological constant problem and the gauge hierarchy problem can be solved .",
    "however , the strong cp problem may still be a serious complication for naturalness in the string landscape .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we constructed a supersymmetric ksvz axion model where the supersymmetry breaking scale and the peccei ",
    "quinn symmetry breaking scale were both around @xmath20 gev and the axion could be a viable cold dark matter candidate .",
    "we considered the discrete @xmath1 peccei - quinn symmetry that could be embedded into an anomalous @xmath21 gauge symmetry in string constructions where the anomalies were cancelled by the green  schwarz mechanism .",
    "this @xmath1 discrete symmetry could not be violated by quantum gravitational corrections .",
    "we found @xmath215 is necessary to ensure that the contributions to the @xmath6 term from the non - renormalizable operators are under control .",
    "we also showed that a reasonable quartic coupling for the singlet @xmath15 could be generated from the one - loop corrections of extra vector - like particles .",
    "thus , the intermediate supersymmetry breaking scale was directly connected to the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking scale .",
    "in addition , using two - loop renormalization group equation runnings for the gauge couplings and one - loop renormalization group equation runnings for the yukawa couplings , we showed that gauge coupling unification was achieved at about @xmath2 gev and that the higgs mass was in the range 130 gev to 160 gev .",
    "we also calculated the yukawa couplings for the third family of the sm fermions at the gut scale and commented on the possibility of yukawa coupling unification . in our model , due to intermediate - scale supersymmetry breaking",
    ", we did not have the dimension-5 operator induced proton decay problem , the moduli problem , and the problematic supersymmetry flavor and cp violations , etc .",
    "we also pointed out that if the @xmath23-parity was an exact symmetry , the lsp neutralino could be produced only non - thermally and might have cosmological consequences . if the @xmath23-parity was broken , the tiny masses and bilarge mixings for the left - handed neutrinos could be realized naturally at one - loop , although we had to suppress the tree - level contributions to the neutrino masses from the @xmath24 terms in the superpotential .",
    "furthermore , we briefly discussed the other axion models : the dfsz axion model with intermediate - scale supersymmetry breaking where the stabilization of the axion solution and the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking were similar , the axion models with string - scale supersymmetry breaking , and the axion models with split supersymmetry .    t. li would like to thank i. gogoladze for helpful discussions .",
