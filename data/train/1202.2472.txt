    "the density matrix @xmath0 is interpreted statistically by the concept of measurement @xcite .",
    "the role of the latter is that it assigns classical variables @xmath7 to the quantum density matrix @xmath0 : @xmath8 without such assignment , the quantum theory would be incomplete because the matrix @xmath0 itself can not be identified as classical variables . a matrix element ,",
    "say @xmath9 , of @xmath0 does not behave like true classical variables should .",
    "how should true classical variables behave ?",
    "the answer is a new ` free will test ' to distinguish the formal classical variables from the true ones which we call _",
    "suppose we have assigned a classical variable @xmath7 to the quantum state @xmath0 at a given time .",
    "we expect of a tangible classical @xmath7 that we can use it at our free will to control the future dynamics of our system .",
    "we expect in particular that we can make the future unitary evolution depend on @xmath7 .",
    "if the resulting theory remains consistent then @xmath7 is tangible classical variable and the given assignment @xmath10 passes the free will test .",
    "fwt is satisfied within standard quantum theory . as we said , the assignment @xmath10 is given by a von neumann measurement .",
    "the mathematical ingredient is a complete orthogonal set of projectors @xmath11 where the labels @xmath7 , also called measurement outcomes , are the possible classical values that will be assigned to @xmath0 at random with probability @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the emergence of the classical variable @xmath7 is accompanied by the instantaneous ` collapse ' of the state : @xmath13 now , according to fwt , we assume a @xmath7-dependent unitary dynamics @xmath14 , evolve each @xmath15 and average them over the statistics @xmath16 of the classical variable @xmath7 , yielding : @xmath17 we find that the map @xmath18 is linear .",
    "this linearity is necessary @xcite for the statistical interpretation @xcite of @xmath19 , it maintains consistency of the theory .",
    "hence we see the measurement outcomes @xmath7 are tangible classical variables , fwt has been passed by standard quantum mechanics .",
    "fwt is powerful . in standard quantum mechanics",
    "it singles out quantum measurement theory as the only way to assign tangible classical variables to the quantum state .",
    "measurement outcomes are the only tangible classical variables .",
    "this also implies that a deterministic assignment @xmath10 will never pass fwt , will never yield a tangible @xmath7 .",
    "had we assigned @xmath7 to the upper - left matrix element of @xmath0 the resulting dynamics @xmath18 would be non - linear which is a typical inconsistency indicating that @xmath7 is not tangible .",
    "a frequently used non - tangible classical variable is the quantum mean , e.g. , of the coordinate @xmath20 : @xmath21 for this deterministic way of assignment the @xmath7-dependent dynamics @xmath22 is non - linear and invalidates the statistical interpretation of @xmath19 .",
    "tangible classical variable is the husimi assignment of phase - space coordinates @xmath23 of a quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "it can be underlied by the measurement of the overcomplete set of coherent state projectors @xmath24 .",
    "the probability of the assignment is @xmath12 .",
    "the consistency ( linearity ) of the @xmath7-dependent dynamics follows from the same structure ( [ coll]-[vnz_meas ] ) as in case of standard projective measurements .",
    "we experience quantum and classical phenomena in our surrounding .",
    "classical ones are apparent , they emerge from the quantum ones according to quantum theory .",
    "this explanation can be extended for all phenomena except for quantum gravity where the emergence of classical continuum is still waiting for a consistent theory . for this failure ,",
    "different things within standard theory can be blamed . even the standard approach itself",
    "can be wrong if classical phenomena are the basic ones and quantum ones only emerge from it @xcite . in any case , a minimum lesson exists .",
    "we should extend our investigations for all possible mathematical models of the mere coexistence of the quantum and classical phenomena .",
    "i avoid talking about their interaction because this term is reserved for something which is dynamical .",
    "instead , i talk about their mutual influence .",
    "quantum and classical phenomena coexist where coexistence includes their mutual dependence : @xmath25 mathematically this means that i allow for any coupling between the equation governing @xmath26 of the quantum sector and the equation governing @xmath27 of the classical sector , respectively .    the mathematical form of the influence of the classical on the quantum looks trivial .",
    "the hamiltonian will be made @xmath7-dependent : @xmath28\\;.\\ ] ] this dependence may be time - local or time - non - local , it must respect causality anyway : @xmath1 at time @xmath29 should not depend on @xmath30 at @xmath31 .",
    "the influence of quantum on classical , called back - reaction , is the problem . in sec .",
    "[ introduction ] we mentioned that the measurement theory can assign a certain @xmath7 to the current state @xmath0 .",
    "it is also reassuring that the influence ( [ coll ] ) of @xmath7 on @xmath0 is part of von neumann theory .",
    "there is a major defect : the von neumann assignment of @xmath7 is instantaneous , it can not assign the continuum @xmath27 to @xmath26 .",
    "the von neumann theory of measurement has been generalized for time - continuous measurements so that in principle we possess a model of quantum - classical coexistence .",
    "the realistic non - markovian continuous measurement theory is in its infancy , faces particular issues .",
    "parallel to the measurement approach , many different  though necessarily interrelated  proposals have targeted the quantum - classical coexistence and the implicit back - reaction .",
    "some of them are very popular , some of them are less so .",
    "this time we ask the same question : do they pass fwt ?      robust quantum fields in quantum cosmology ( also in nuclear , molecular , laser physics , e.t.c .",
    ") may look like classical fields . they can be replaced by classical fields in mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "this is a very successful method to identify the classical continuum @xmath7 by the quantum mean value of the robust quantum field @xmath20 in question : @xmath32 the mean - field @xmath27 is smooth and causal . to apply fwt",
    ", we make @xmath33 depend on @xmath27 : @xmath28\\;.\\ ] ] this means a non - linear evolution for @xmath0 , it denies the statistical interpretation of @xmath26 .",
    "the mean - field @xmath7 is not tangible .",
    "hence the corresponding assignment @xmath10 may be a good approximation but it is flawed fundamentally ( as it has already been known independently of fwt ) .",
    "this is the oldest theory @xcite of assigning classical continuum to the quantum state .",
    "the assignment of the classical variable @xmath27 concerns the coordinate operator @xmath20 , the theory is restricted for pure state density matrices @xmath34 .",

    "the trajectory @xmath27 is smooth and causal .",
    "does fwt pass ?",
    "if we causally control @xmath1 by @xmath7 , e.g. : we add a deliberate potential @xmath39 , the theory remains consistent with quantum mechanics .",
    "if , however , we apply a more general casual control and add a potential @xmath40 at time @xmath29 , controlled by @xmath30 at an earlier time @xmath41 , then the theory wo nt be consistent with standard quantum mechanics .",
    "the de - broglie ",
    "bohm trajectory @xmath7 is useful , e.g. , in quantum chemistry calculations @xcite but it may prove not to be tangible , not to be fundamental assignment of classical continuum to the quantum system unless we confirm or ignore fwt .",
    "this is the key mechanism @xcite of how quantum systems may , without measurement , express classical features . at certain specific circumstances ,",
    "the assignment @xmath42 can be introduced even to closed , unitarily evolving , quantum systems .",
    "a rigorous mathematical model @xcite can be based on the class ( history- ) operator @xmath43 the time - ordered product of @xmath44 hermitian projectors chosen from @xmath44 independent complete orthogonal sets .",
    "the candidate classical variable is the time - series @xmath45 of the labels .",
    "the assignment is random , with the probability @xmath46 .",
    "the consistency of the assignment requires the decoherence condition : @xmath47    whether fwt passes or does nt ?",
    "we conjecture it does , at least under largely general circumstances .",
    "the correct answer needs future investigations , see the proofs @xcite of a related simple test of dynamic robustness .",
    "if the classical variable @xmath7 turns out to be tangible still it needs a refinement since the construction ( [ cz ] ) is discrete , the time - series of classical variables @xmath48 is discrete , not a continuum yet . to yield the tangible classical continuum @xmath27",
    "one has to take a certain time - continuous limit of the theory .",
    "this limit is non - trivial , it may just coincide @xcite with theories of time - continuous measurement .",
    "we learned in sec .",
    "[ free ] that a quantum measurement assigns a tangible classical variable @xmath7 to the quantum state @xmath0 .",
    "we can use sequential measurements to assign the time - series @xmath48 .",
    "the problem is the same as with the decoherence theory . to assign a tangible classical continuum @xmath27 one has to take the time - continuous limit .",
    "the fundamental need of the continual assignment @xmath10 led to the theory of time - continuous quantum measurement @xcite ; the theory was invented and fully developed independently in other important contexts @xcite .",
    "let s restrict ourselves for presenting the structure of assignment itself : @xmath49 this variable is the time - continuous outcome of the time - continuous measurement .",
    "as such , it inherits the tangibility of single measurement outcomes : @xmath27 can safely be used to control the hamiltonian at any later time . in other words ,",
    "the assignment passes fwt .",
    "it is remarkable that the white - noise contribution turns the non - tangible mean - field ( [ z_meanf ] ) into the tangible classical variable .",
    "the mathematics of time - continuous measurement theory re - appears in dynamical collapse theories @xcite . despite vast research on their ontological status ,",
    "the tangible variable @xmath7 has traditionally been abandoned , with rare exceptions @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we face a novel issue with the assignment ( [ z_whitenoise ] ) .",
    "the white - noise function is everywhere singular hence the classical variable @xmath27 becomes singular everywhere .",
    "the white - noise is an artefact rooted in the simple memoryless ( markovian ) model of time - continuous measurement",
    ". we could get smooth colored noise and smooth tangible @xmath27 in a non - markovian theory @xcite : @xmath50 this brings causality issues in .",
    "recent discussions predicts that the tangible non - markovian assignments @xmath10 are restricted by time - delay / retrodiction @xcite . at the current time",
    "@xmath29 the assignment ( [ z_colourednoise ] ) is tangible for earlier times @xmath41 and @xmath30 is not ( yet ) tangible at the current time @xmath29 if @xmath51 gets closer to @xmath29 than the non - markovian memory of the measurement .",
    "when a classical continuum @xmath7 and a quantum system coexist we can assume dynamical coupling for them .",
    "we could just use an interaction hamailtonian @xmath52 which is a hermitian operator as well as a function of the classical dynamical variable . for longtime",
    "it has been known that such purely canonical hybrid dynamics does not work .",
    "nonetheless , there are various phenomenological constructions of hybrid dynamics and they describe the coexistence between classical continuum and quantum variables , see salcedo s summary @xcite and references therein .",
    "suppose a quantum system described by the density matrix @xmath0 coexists with a classical system described by the density @xmath53 over variables @xmath7 which may be the canonical coordinates @xmath54 .",
    "if the quantum and classical systems have not yet influenced each other , i.e. , they are independent , then their composite state can be described by the hybrid density @xmath55 .",
    "if we let them influence each other , the product structure is no longer valid . the evolution @xmath56 preserves positivity and normalization .",
    "the evolution must be linear for the sake of statistical interpretation of @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "this is the formal criterion of the statistical consistency discussed by @xcite in details . in proposals of hybrid dynamics of ensemble coupling @xcite or coupling the mean - field to the classical sector ,",
    "the hybrid state @xmath58 would not follow a linear evolution , in accordance with the analysis in @xcite .",
    "this does not necessarily mean the failure of fwt .",
    "fwt is a different and more powerful test w.r.t . the statistical test in @xcite .",
    "some hybrid theories intend to replace or modify the standard statistical interpretation of the density matrix . in all these cases",
    "fwt requests that the given non - standard theory remain self - consistent under the @xmath7-dependent causal control of the dynamics , no matter if @xmath57 evolves linearly or not , no matter if the hybrid dynamics is a sort of canonical one or something radically different .",
    "however , the theories with non - linear evolution of the hybrid density will easily loose their self - consistence under the @xmath7-dependent causal control .",
    "there are many versions of hybrid dynamics @xcite which are still to be checked against fwt .",
    "some are likely to pass , especially those which couple certain measurement outcomes  tangible variables  to the classical sector , see @xcite coupling the markovian outcome ( [ z_whitenoise ] ) , @xcite coupling the non - markovian continuum of husimi - variables .",
    "the whole diversity of foundational theories of quantum - classical relationship , from measurement theory to hybrid dynamics , distills to the mathematical issue of coexistence of classical continuum and quantum variables .",
    "this coexistence must respect certain basic constraints on one hand and might be radically different from standard quantum theory on the other . only we have to formulate our basic constraints mathematically .",
    "this concept was raised in @xcite . and further explained in @xcite : ` in our longstanding struggles with the problem of classical vs. quantum , the main issue to overcome has always been the painful lack of a consistent model that `` couples '' the coexisting classical and quantum entities . are nt quantum dynamics and measurement too restrictive ? are there any other consistent mechanisms ? ' .",
    "one of the non - trivial mathematical constraints is the free will test .",
    "it has nothing direct to do with the free will theorem @xcite .",
    "a traditional definition of ` free will ' in quantum theory is our freedom to choose the measurement setup , see e.g. in @xcite .",
    "my definition is our free choice ( control ) of future dynamics ( and measurement setups , if you like ) in function of our knowledge obtained earlier .",
    "the deliberate @xmath7-dependent causal control of the dynamics will possess its mathematical representation within all plausible theory of classical - quantum coexistence .",
    "the condition that the theory remains self - consistent must be decidable in all theories .",
    "if not , it means that the theory should first be concretized .",
    "that fwt may not be satisfied by a number of popular theories of coexistence was also recognized in @xcite .",
    "( tangible and non tangible classical variables were called just _ true _ and _ not true _ ones , respectively . )",
    "i havent considered the status of my proposal among current competing metaphyical concepts @xcite .",
    "it may become part of them or contribute to them in some form .",
    "we should not overemphasize the metaphysical aspect at the expense of physics proper .",
    "the proposal is objective and mathematical , i could well replace the anthropic term fwt by fct : free control test .",
    "it calls for direct checks ( i.e. : calculations ) in a number of theories , it shows the mathematical barriers against tangible classical variables other than measurement outcomes in whatever sophisticated formalisms .",
