    "the exact theory of coulomb distortions of the spectrum of ultrarelativistic lepton pairs photoproduced in the coulomb field of the nucleus has been developed by bethe and maximon @xcite .",
    "it is based on the description of leptons by exact solutions of the dirac equation in the coulomb field ( see e.g. , the textbook @xcite ) . in the feynman diagram language one has to sum multiphoton exchanges between produced electrons and positrons and the target nucleus . for ultrarelativistic leptons",
    "this reduces to the eikonal factors in the impact parameter representation . in the momentum space",
    "the same eikonal form leads to simple recurrence relations between the @xmath4 and @xmath5photon exchange amplitudes @xcite , the incoming photon can be either real or virtual .",
    "there are two fundamental points behind these simple results :    * the lightcone momenta of ultrarelativistic leptons are conserved in multiple scattering process ( i.e. , if the nucleus moves along the @xmath6 lightcone and the produced leptons move along the @xmath7 lightcone , then the @xmath8 components of the lepton momenta are conserved ) . *",
    "the s  channel helicity of leptons is conserved in high energy qed ( see the textbook @xcite ) .",
    "it is the last property by which distortions reduce to a simple eikonal factor .",
    "the same properties allow one to cast the pair production cross section in the dipole representation @xcite .",
    "they have also been behind the color dipole pqcd analysis of nuclear distortions and the derivation of nonlinear @xmath9factorization for multijet hard processes in dis off nuclei @xcite .    as was shown in @xcite , in certain cases of practical interest the so  called abelianization takes place . specifically , the hard dijet production in hadron ",
    "nucleus collision is dominated by a hard collision of an isolated parton from the beam hadron simultaneously with many gluons from the nucleus which belong to different nucleons of a target nucleus .",
    "none the less , at least for the single  particle spectra , the interaction with a large number of nuclear gluons can be reduced to that with a single gluon from the collective gluon field of a nucleus , i.  e. , the nonlinear @xmath9factorization reduces to the linear one and in terms of the collective glue one only needs to evaluate the familiar born cross sections .",
    "the extension of nonlinear @xmath9factorization for hard processes from hadron  nucleus collisions to collisions of ultrarelativistic nuclei is a formidable task which has not been properly addressed so far .",
    "the lightcone qed and qcd share many properties , and here we address a much simpler , abelian , problem of coulomb distortions of lepton pairs produced in peripheral collisions of relativistic nuclei .",
    "the process of lepton pair production in the coulomb fields of two colliding ultrarelativistic heavy ions was intensively investigated in the past years @xcite .",
    "such activity is mainly connected with new possibilities opened with operation of such facilities as rhic and lhc . despite the high activity in this area the issue of correct allowance for final state interaction of produced leptons with the colliding ion coulomb fields is lacking yet .",
    "the main results obtained so far in this direction are the following :    * the produced lepton pair interacts with the coulomb fields of the ion and the corresponding corrections have a noticeable impact on the cross section of the process under consideration at finite energies @xcite . *",
    "the perturbation series corresponding to multiple interaction of a produced pair with coulomb fields can be summed and the result can be cast in the eikonal  like form @xcite , if one restricts ourself to terms growing with energy in the cross section @xcite . in qed",
    "such an approximation can be considered as satisfactory one , but it does not work in qcd and the problem of higher order corrections in pair production demands further investigation .    in our paper @xcite , we cited the amplitude @xmath10 which is irrelevant in leading and next - to leading logarithmic approximations in qed .",
    "nevertheless , the knowledge of such a kind contributions becomes important for similar processes in qcd with multigluon exchanges between the color constituents of each of the colliding hadrons and the created quark ",
    "antiquark pair .",
    "thus , the main motivation of the present paper is a further investigation of multiple exchanges and their impact on the lepton pair yield in the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , an issue which is useful not only in understanding the electromagnetic processes , but has a wide application in qcd .",
    "we did not consider the case when one of the ions radiates a single photon and other one radiates an arbitrary number of photons absorbed by a created pair @xcite .",
    "the photon exchanges between the ions also were not taken into account @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec:22 ] , we consider the case when each of the colliding ions radiated two photons which created the lepton pair .",
    "we derived the relevant amplitude @xmath11 using the powerful sudakov technique well suited for calculations of the processes at high energies .    in sec.[sec : wa ] , we studied the wide  angle limit in pair production kinematics corresponding to the case of large transverse momenta of pair components . in these limits",
    "the results are much more transparent than in the general case , as can be seen from the form of the differential cross section which is also presented .    in sec.[sec :",

    "the denominators of virtual photon green functions in the considered kinematics depend only on transverse components of the corresponding 4-vectors , thus @xmath39 there are 24 fd contributing to @xmath10 .",
