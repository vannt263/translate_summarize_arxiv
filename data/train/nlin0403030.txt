    "while the study of synchronization of coupled dynamic systems has a long history  @xcite , it is still an extremely active research topic  @xcite . in two recent papers  @xcite , we proposed a new theoretical analysis tool , which we called _ partial contraction theory _ , which is based on _ contraction",
    "_ concept  @xcite .",
    "we used partial contraction theory to analyze the collective behaviors of dynamic networks with arbitrary size and general connectivity .",
    "synchronization conditions were derived for networks with diffusion - like couplings , which essentially require the network to be connected , the maximum eigenvalue of the uncoupled jacobian matrix to be upper bounded , and the coupling strengths to exceed a threshold .    in this paper , we extend the results in  @xcite to coupled networks with adaptation .",
    "we show that synchronization still occurs under very similar conditions if adaptation is added to one or more than one elements in a network .",
    "estimated parameters will converge to real values if the stable system behaviors are sufficiently rich or persistently exciting , which is the case when the individual elements are oscillators , for instance .",
    "this result is conceptually new as it differs with most existing adaptation models , in the sense that the adaptation here only adds to a small part of the network , and the target behavior is synchronization rather than an explicit desired trajectory .",
    "imagine for instance that some elements in a network lose the normal values of some parameters .",
    "they can recover the losing information from the rest of the network , as long as there are still elements holding this information .",
    "the nodes holding the real parameters can be considered `` knowledge - based leaders '' .",
    "they differ with the usual `` power - based '' leaders or virtual leaders such as those in e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite , which specify desired trajectories for the network by unidirectionally coupling to it . with adaptation",
    ", we can also add new nodes into a network without knowing the dynamic properties of the nodes already in the network .",
    "section  [ sec : review ] briefly reviews contraction and partial contraction theories , and the main results we derived for synchronization .",
    "adaptation for two coupled systems is studied in section  [ sec : adaptation - two ] , and the results are extended to general coupled networks in section  [ sec : adaptation - network ] .",
    "brief concluding remarks are offered in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "let us first introduce some basic graph theory concepts  @xcite which will be used in the rest of the paper .",

    "the first eigenvalue is always zero , corresponding to the eigenvector @xmath11^t$ ] .",
    "assign an arbitrary orientation @xmath12 to an undirected graph @xmath0 .",

    "all the other entries of @xmath15 are equal to @xmath16 . moreover , @xmath17    if the graph is weighted , we have the weighted laplacian matrix @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a diagonal matrix with the @xmath20 diagonal entry @xmath21_k = { \\bf k}_{ij}\\ $ ] corresponding to the weight of the @xmath20 link . if @xmath22 is a matrix , @xmath23 is block diagonal .",
    "similarly @xmath15 has block entries @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "if @xmath31 is uniformly strictly negative , any infinitesimal length @xmath33 converges exponentially to zero . by path integration at fixed time , this implies in turn that all the solutions converge exponentially to a single trajectory , independently of the initial conditions .",
