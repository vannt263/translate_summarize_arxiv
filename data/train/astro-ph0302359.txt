    "the extragalactic background of lyman continuum photons plays an important role in ionizing the many absorption line systems seen shortward of ly@xmath1 emission in quasar spectra , including those seen at low redshifts using the ultraviolet capabilities of the hubble space telescope ( bahcall et al .",
    "the ionizing background intensity determines the neutral gas fraction in ly@xmath1 forest absorbers and the ion ratios seen in metal absorption line systems .",
    "furthermore , understanding the ionizing background is important for developing theories for the formation and evolution of galaxies and the ly@xmath1 forest and possibly for finding the baryonic mass contained within galaxies and the intergalactic medium .",
    "interesting questions remain as to how much of this background is contributed by galaxies and what role galaxies play in ionizing gas around and between them that is detected as ly@xmath1 absorption .",
    "the only largely neutral ly@xmath1 absorbers are the damped systems which have neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "ionized absorbers include some lyman limit systems ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) and ly@xmath1 forest absorbers which have lower neutral column densities .",
    "lyman limit systems are thought to arise around galaxies ( bergeron & boiss 1991 ; steidel 1995 ) , while ly@xmath1 forest absorbers have been detected which are as weak as @xmath6 @xmath3 .",
    "although many of these may be associated with the smallest amounts of intergalactic gas , including that in void regions ( dav et al .",

    "bowen , pettini , & blades ( 2002 ) have shown recently that while nearby ly@xmath1 absorbers are difficult to match with particular observed galaxies , @xmath8 is correlated with the local density of detected luminous galaxies .    in carefully observed spiral galaxy discs the neutral column density falls off slowly with radius over most of the extents as seen with 21 cm hi observations , but then a rapid truncation is seen .",
    "bochkarev & sunyaev ( 1977 ) first suggested that a truncation would occur in a spiral disc at a sufficient radius where the hi column becomes ionized by an extragalactic background .",
    "disk edges have been modelled also by maloney ( 1993 ) , dove & shull ( 1994a ) , and corbelli & salpeter ( 1993 ) .",
    "more recently ionized gas has been detected in h@xmath1 emission using a fabry - perot ` staring technique ' ( bland - hawthorn et al .",
    "1994 ) beyond the hi edges of several nearby galaxies ( bland - hawthorn , freeman & quinn 1997 ; bland - hawthorn 1998 ) .",

    "other methods for estimating this intensity give generally consistent results typically within the lower end of their uncertainty range , including limits on h@xmath1 emission from high - latitude galactic clouds ( vogel 1995 ; tufte , reynolds , & haffner 1998 ; vogel et al .",

    "their values are approximately consistent with the measurements above , so that quasars make an important and possibly dominant contribution to the ionizing background even at low redshifts .",
    "while the number density of quasars is low at low redshifts , the universe becomes optically thin to ultraviolet photons at redshifts @xmath14 ( haardt & madau 1996 ) such that ultraviolet photons emitted at @xmath15 are likely to survive without reprocessing until @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast , the ionizing spectrum at higher redshifts is modified by absorption and reemission ( fardal , giroux , & shull 1998 )",
    ".    what contribution might galaxies make to the ionizing background at low redshifts ?",
    "some suggestions have been made that insufficient numbers of ionizing photons ( less than one percent ) escape from galaxies for an important contribution to the ionizing background ( deharveng et al .",
    "1997 ; henry 2002 ) , though others measure ( bland - hawthorn & maloney 1999 ; leitherer et al .",
    "1995 ; goldader et al .  2002 ; hurwitz , jelinsky , & van dyke dixon 1997 ) and model ( dove & shull 1994b ; dove , shull & ferrara 2000 ) higher escape fractions between three and ten percent .",
    "giallongo , fontana , & madau ( 1997 ) , shull et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and bianchi , cristiani , & kim ( 2001 ) find that star - forming galaxies could even dominate the ionizing background if at least a few percent of the ultraviolet photons escape .",
    "some ionizing photons are likely to escape from most galaxies .",
    "bland - hawthorn ( 1998 ) suggests that the gas detected beyond the hi disc edge in several spiral galaxies is ionized by stellar populations within the galaxies , as the emission measures are stronger than those predicted ( maloney 1993 ; dove & shull 1994a ) for an extragalactic background .    given that many stronger ly@xmath1 absorbers are found close to galaxies , it is possible that stellar populations within galaxies make some contribution to the ultraviolet photons that ionize any nearby absorbers . thus what is measured as ionizing background radiation may vary in intensity with location , depending upon the galaxy clustering environment or the properties , such as brightness and extinction behaviour , of any nearby galaxies .",
    "the method for simulating a fluctuating ionizing background is described in section 2 , while the resulting fluctuations are discussed in section 3 .",
    "results of varying model parameters are discussed in section 4 , and section 5 describes the relationship of the ionization rate fluctuations to the properties and locations of galaxies .",
    "the value of @xmath17 is assumed to be 100 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "the simulation used here is an updated version of that first described in linder ( 1998 ) , where in each case here 12590 clustered galaxies are placed in a cube with an edge of 28.9 mpc ( except where this edge is adjusted at redshift one ) .",
    "ly@xmath1 absorbers arise in gas within and extending from galaxy discs , which are modelled as in charlton , salpeter , & hogan ( 1993 ) and charlton , salpeter & linder ( 1994 ) .",
    "each galaxy has an exponential inner disc and an outer extension where the column density declines as a power law with radius , assumed as galaxy discs are generally found to be exponential while absorbers roughly obey a power - law column density distribution at lower column densities ( see appendix  [ appendixa ] ) . in reality",
    "a smoother transition probably occurs , and some evidence for such a transition has been seen by hoffman et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . the radius at which each hi disc changes from exponential to power law decline was defined previously ( linder 1998 ) in terms of the disc ionization edge , as little is known about this switching radius . since the ionizing background varies here",
    ", however , it makes more sense to define this switching radius in terms of the galaxy disc scale length . assuming the switch from exponential to power law occurs in each galaxy at a radius of four hi disc scale lengths , similar results are seen in the absorber counts arising as compared to absorber counts simulated using the previously defined switching radius .",
    "the galaxies are chosen to have visible properties based upon observed distributions of galaxy parameters , such as a schechter luminosity function and a flat surface brightness distribution ( mcgaugh 1996 ) .",
    "the hi disc scale lengths ( @xmath18 ) are assumed to be proportional to the @xmath19 scale lengths ( @xmath20 ) , where @xmath21 to start , as this was previously found to give rise to reasonable absorber counts in linder ( 1998 ) .",
    "the gaseous properties of the galaxies can thus be related to the visible properties .",
    "this makes sense as galaxy discs are generally somewhat larger in hi than in optical images , although the hi sizes of galaxy discs also vary depending upon the location within a cluster ( cayatte et al .",
    "1994 ) so that the average ratio of @xmath22 is uncertain .",
    "each galaxy is placed in a cube of space , where the positions are chosen to be clustered as described in linder ( 2000 ) using a fractal type method based upon soneira & peebles ( 1978 ) .",
    "random lines of sight through the box can then be simulated , and an absorption line is assumed to arise when these lines of sight intersect any disc or outer extension .",
    "neutral column densities for absorbers are found by integrating the hi density along the line of sight .",
    "each galaxy disc has an ionization edge , or radius beyond which no layer of neutral gas remains .",
    "the vertical ionization structure of the gas is modelled as in linder ( 1998 ) which is similar to the model in maloney ( 1993 ) . inside of this ionization radius",

    "the gas above height ( @xmath23 ) and beyond the ionization radius is assumed to be in ionization equilibrium where @xmath24 , for a highly ionized hydrogen gas with total ( neutral plus ionized ) density @xmath25 and neutral density @xmath26 .",
    "the recombination coefficient is @xmath27 @xmath28 s@xmath29 and the gas temperature @xmath30 is assumed to be 20,000 k. the frequency- and direction - averaged ionization rate @xmath31 is determined at each point in space while converging numerically upon the ionization edge ( the minimum disc radius where ( @xmath32 ) ) in a self - consistent manner , and @xmath31 is calculated as described below .",
    "the intensity of ionizing radiation is allowed to vary at each point in space within the box .",
    "the ionization rate @xmath31 , which was previously assumed to be constant in linder ( 1998 ; 2000 ) , is recalculated here at each point in space , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the contribution from quasars .",
    "the value of @xmath35 can be recalculated at any point within the box based upon the flux from the surrounding galaxies .",

    "( 1999 ) at @xmath37 based upon spectra from haardt & madau ( 1996 ) .",
    "bland - hawthorn & maloney ( 1999 ) modelled the escape of ionizing photons from our galaxy by extrapolating from a calculation of the ionizing photon surface density at the solar circle using nearby o stars by vacca , garmany , & shull ( 1996 ) .",
    "bland - hawthorn ( 1998 ) gives a simple estimate of the number of ionizing photons escaping from the galaxy , where @xmath38 phot @xmath3 s@xmath11 as in the first equation of their appendix , at some point with distance @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the angle from the galactic pole , and @xmath41 is the lyman limit optical depth . in order to add such a radiation field to @xmath31 in the units above ,",
    "we need a frequency - averaged quantity which also considers the ionization cross section for hydrogen , where @xmath42 at frequency @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the lyman limit frequency .",
    "thus , for example , the contribution from our galaxy to @xmath31 at some point at a distance @xmath45 from its center would be @xmath46 where @xmath47 . the mean value for @xmath48 is weighted by assuming that @xmath49 so that @xmath50 we assume @xmath51 , which gives @xmath52 , while sutherland & shull ( 1999 ) prefer a similar @xmath53 to @xmath54 for starburst galaxies , which would result in @xmath55 .",
    "bland - hawthorn & maloney ( 1999 ) assumed that our galaxy has an axisymmetric exponential disc where the ionizing photon surface density @xmath56 for disc scale length @xmath57 and central ionizing photon surface density @xmath58 .",
    "integrating @xmath59 over the disc area out to an infinite radius gives a number of ionizing photons which is proportional to @xmath60 , while the ionizing photon surface density can also be expressed as an ionizing surface brightness ( @xmath61 ) where @xmath62 .",
    "thus we extrapolate the formula above to other galaxies by correcting for variations in central surface brightness ( @xmath63 ) and disc scale length for galaxy @xmath64 as compared to galactic ( mw ) values , by assuming that the ionizing scale lengths and central surface brightnesses are proportional to the b values . the galaxy contribution to @xmath31 for some galaxy @xmath64",

    "when calculating the ionizing intensity seen by the outer part of a galaxy , extinction from gas and dust is important in shielding absorbing gas from being ionized by the inner parts of the galaxy .",
    "although some neutral gas must remain around galaxies which is often seen to give rise to absorption , the galaxy itself still may be the most important contributor to ionizing the gas in its outer parts .",
    "to start we assume that each galaxy disc is flat within two hi scale lengths and then warped by ten degrees beyond that value ( briggs 1990 ) , so that the outer parts of the disc are exposed to some ionizing radiation which escapes from the inner regions .",
    "a value of @xmath68 is preferred by bland - hawthorn ( 1998 ) when modelling our galaxy , although the preferred value could be different as a result of an error ( bland - hawthorn & maloney 2001 ) . on the other hand it has been difficult to detect any dust extinction in low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies ( for example oneil , bothun & impey 1997 ) .",
    "little is known about the gas - to - dust ratio in lsb galaxies , although the total extinction is likely to be higher in high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxies .",
    "thus it might make sense to assume that @xmath69 is related to central surface brightness for the simulated galaxies .",
    "thus a linear relationship was assumed where @xmath68 for a galaxy with a freeman surface brightness value of @xmath70 , and @xmath71 for @xmath72 , so that @xmath73 .    shadowing , or extinction from gas between an absorber and a given ionizing source , is not taken into account as this would require substantially more computing time .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation in the sense that the universe is optically thin at redshifts @xmath74 ( haardt & madau 1996 ) shadowing could make the calculated @xmath31 values slightly lower in some cases , although typically the second closest galaxy to an absorber contributes only a few percent of the ultraviolet flux that the closest galaxy contributes .",
    "starburst galaxies are not treated as emitting differently from other galaxies within the simulation , although the galaxy population is chosen within the simulation to be consistent with the observed optical galaxy luminosity function and thus does not exclude the existence of such objects .",
    "some of the more luminous galaxies may have a clumpy distribution of dust , which might allow for a larger fraction of their ionizing photons to escape as compared to other galaxies .",
    "there could be an additional population of infrared selected galaxies that would not be included within the luminosity function simulated here .",
    "although these galaxies also might make some contribution to the ionizing background , a fairly small fraction of ultraviolet photons are thought to escape from them ( goldader et al . 2002 ) .",

    "however most ly@xmath1 absorbers , including even the weakest ones , are found to trace the large scale galaxy distribution , so that they are likely to arise in gas which is about as close to galaxies as that in the first simulation .",
