    "it has been known that time delays between multiple images of strong gravitational lens systems offer an interesting method to measure the hubble constant @xmath2 , the most fundamental cosmological parameter that governs the length and time scale of our universe @xcite .",
    "a huge advantage of this method is that it does not rely on so - called distance ladder and can measure the global hubble constant independently of any local measurements .",
    "motivated by this time delays have been measured in more than 10 lensed quasar systems ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the situation as it presents is , however , somewhat confusing and controversial .",
    "@xcite claimed from the analysis of several lens systems that the hubble constant should be relatively low , @xmath3 .",
    "the time delay of sdss j1650 + 4251 also prefers the low hubble constant @xcite . on the other hand , @xcite performed systematic mass modeling of b1608 + 656 using all available data from radio to optical and found constrained the value of the hubble constant to be @xmath4 .",
    "the analysis of the smallest separation lens b0218 + 357 yields @xmath5 @xcite . by combining time delays in 10 lensed quasar systems @xcite obtained @xmath6 .",
    "the large variation of derived values of the hubble constant from time delays reflects the fact that time delays are quite sensitive to mass distributions of lens objects , which leads to strong degeneracies between lens mass profiles and the hubble constant .",
    "the most fundamental , mathematically rigorous degeneracy is the mass - sheet degeneracy @xcite ; inserting an uniform sheet instead of decreasing the mass normalization of lenses changes estimated values of the hubble constant while leaving unchanged the image observables .",
    "this degeneracy implies that the derived values of the hubble constant also degenerates with radial density profiles of of lens galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition , it may degenerate with the angular structure of lenses as well @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of time delays on mass profiles suggests that by assuming the hubble constant , which can be determined by other methods @xcite , we can put constraints on mass distributions of lenses , in particular radial density profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one way to overcome the degeneracies is to adopt lens systems whose lens potentials can well be constrained by many observational constraints .",
    "an example of such constraints comes from lensed images of quasar host galaxies .",
    "the lensed host galaxies often form einstein rings , which accurately and independently determines the structure of the lens potential as well as the shape of the lensed host galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the small - scale structure of lensed quasars , such as radio jets and sub - components , determine lens potentials in a similar way as einstein rings ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , the measurement of velocity dispersions of lens galaxies serves as useful constraints on mass distributions , helping to break degeneracies between mass models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "lens systems for which these strong additional constraints are available , sometime referred as `` golden lenses '' , have been thought to be an effective probe of the hubble constant .    another potentially powerful , but less studied , method to measure",
    "the hubble constant is a statistical approach . even if each individual lens lacks strong constraints that allow detailed investigations of the mass distribution , by combining many lens systems one can put tight constraints on the hubble constant . as mentioned above , this approach was in some sense demonstrated recently by @xcite who combined 10 lensed quasar systems to constrain the hubble constant .",
    "a caveat is that lensed quasars sometimes suffer from selection effects .",
    "for instance , brighter lensed quasars with larger image separations are more likely to lie in dense environments such as groups and clusters @xcite , thus the hubble constant from those lensed quasars may be systematically higher than the true value without any correction of the effect of dark matter along the line of sight .",
    "this indicates the importance of well - defined statistical sample of lensed quasars for which we can quantitatively estimate and correct the selection effect .",
    "while the statistical sample has been very limited so far , containing @xmath7 lenses even for the largest lens sample @xcite , larger lens surveys will be soon available by ongoing / future lens surveys such as done by the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) , and the supernova / acceleration probe ( snap ) .",
    "future lens surveys will also find strong lensing of distant supernovae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for which time delays can easily be measured ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore the statistical approach is growing its importance .    in this paper",
    ", we study how time delays depend on various properties of the lens potential and image configurations , which is essential for the determination of the hubble constant from time delays . using both analytic and numerical methods ,",
    "we show how time delays are affected by several complexity of the lens potential , such as radial mass profiles , external perturbations , higher order multipoles , and substructures .",
    "we then derive the expected distributions of time delays by adopting realistic lens potentials .",
    "the distribution , in turn , can be used to derive statistically the value of the hubble constant from observed time delays .",
    "this approach differs from the statistical argument by @xcite in the sense that they fit image positions of individual lens systems to constrain the hubble constant and then combined results of all the lens systems : our new approach does not even require modeling of each lens system .",
    "this has an advantage that we can include lens systems that have too few constraints to determine the lens potential . in this sense",
    "the approach is extension of study by @xcite in which only spherical halos are considered to compute time delay distributions .",
    "we note that the methodology is similar to that adopted by @xcite who derived distributions of flux ratios of image pairs to identify small - scale structure in lens galaxies .",
    "in addition to the measurement of the hubble constant , the sensitivity of time delays on mass models , which we explore in this paper , offers guidance on the usefulness of each time delay measurement as a cosmological or astrophysical probe : if time delays at some image configuration is quite sensitive to detailed structure of the lens such as higher - order multipole terms with small amplitudes or substructures , which are difficult to be constrained even for best - studied lens systems , it is almost hopeless to use these time delays to extract either radial mass profiles or the hubble constant .",
    "our result can be used to assess quantitatively which lens systems are more suitable for detailed studies , i.e. , less sensitive to the complexity of the lens potential",
    ". there has been several insightful analytic work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but here we perform more systematic and comprehensive survey of model dependences of time delays by parameterizing image configurations of lensed quasar systems using dimensionless quantities .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : model ] we introduce several dimensionless quantities that are used to explore the model dependence of time delays .",
    "we study the sensitivity of time delays on the various lens potentials analytically in ",
    "[ sec : ana ] .",
    "section [ sec : pot ] is devoted to construct the conditional distribution of time delays from realistic monte - carlo simulations .",
    "we compare it with observed time delays in  [ sec : obs ] , and constrain the hubble constant in  [ sec : hub ] .",
    "finally discussion of our results and conclusion are given in ",
    "[ sec : dis ] . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt a flat universe with the matter density @xmath8 and the cosmological constant @xmath9 @xcite , although our results are only weakly dependent on the specific choice of the cosmological parameters .",
    "the hubble constant is sometimes described by the dimensionless form @xmath10 .",
    "let us consider a lens system in which a source at @xmath11 is multiply imaged at the image positions @xmath12 .",
    "we also use the polar coordinates for the image positions , @xmath13 .",
    "we always choose the center of the lens object as the origin of the coordinates .",
    "time delays between these multiply images are given by ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath14 , \\label{eq : td}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the redshift of the lens , @xmath16 is the speed of light , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are angular diameter distances from the observer to the lens , from the observer to the source , and from the lens to the source , respectively .",
    "the lens potential @xmath20 is related to the surface mass density of the lens @xmath21 by the poisson equation : @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the critical surface mass density ( @xmath24 is the gravitational constant ) .",
    "note that image positions and source positions are related by the lens equation @xmath25    equation ( [ eq : td ] ) involves unobservable quantities such as @xmath26 and @xmath20 , indicating that time delays in general depend on details of mass models .",
    "however , @xcite has shown that for generalized isothermal potential @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an arbitrary function of @xmath29 , time delays can be expressed in a very simple form involving only the observed image positions : @xmath30 where @xmath31 denote the distance of image @xmath32 from the center of the lens galaxy .",
    "motivated by this analytic result , in this paper we consider the _ reduced time delay _ that is defined by : @xmath33 in this definition , the reduced time delay @xmath34 is always unity if the lens potential can be expressed by equation ( [ eq : iso ] ) , but can deviate from unity if the lens potential has more complicated structures .",
    "in particular , from the analysis of @xcite we obtain @xmath35 at the lowest order of expansion , where @xmath36 is the average surface density in the annulus bounded by the images .",
    "this indicates that the deviation from the isothermal mass distribution has a direct impact on the reduced time delay .",
    "but as we will see later it is affected to some extent by other factors such as external perturbations or small - scale structures as well .",
    "thus we can regard the reduced time delay as a measure of the complexity of the lens .",
    "in addition , equation ( [ eq : xi_def ] ) indicates that we can compute reduced time delays for observed lensed quasar systems with measured time delays by assuming the value of the hubble constant . in this sense , the reduced time delay @xmath34 is a key quantity that represents a link between measured time delays of lens systems and theoretical lens models .",
    "we point out that @xmath34 is dimensionless because time delays are proportional to the square of the size of a lens ( the einstein radius ) .",
    "this allows us to directly compare values of reduced time delays for different lens systems that have different sizes .",
    "we note that @xcite adopted similar but different dimensionless quantity to explore the dependence of time delays on mass models . in the paper ,",
    "the parameter essentially same as equation ( [ eq : xi_def ] ) was also considered , but it was discarded because of the correlation with time delays .",
    "however , the correlation just reflects the effect of surrounding dark matter that is larger for wider separation lenses @xcite .",
    "put another way , such correlation is naturally expected from very different mass distributions and environments between small ( @xmath37 ) and large ( @xmath38 ) separation lenses .",
    "indeed the apparent lack of the correlation between time delays and the scaled time delays in @xcite comes mostly from the large scatter among different image configurations : the effect of external mass is hindered by the large scatter his parametrization involves . therefore in this paper",
    "we propose equation ( [ eq : xi_def ] ) as useful quantity to extract the mass dependences on time delays .",
    "previous analytic calculations of time delays suggest that the model dependence of time delays is a strong function of image configurations @xcite . in this paper",
    "we characterize image configurations by the following two parameters .",
    "one is the _ asymmetry _ of the images define by @xmath39 again , @xmath40 is dimensionless and does not depend on the size of the lens : @xmath41 means the images are roughly at the same distance from the lens galaxy , while @xmath42 indicates very asymmetric configurations that one image lies very close to the lens center and the other image is far apart from the lens .",
    "the other parameter we use is the opening angle of images : @xmath43 in this definition , if the images are directly opposite each other , @xmath44 . on the other hand , close image pairs such as merging images near cusp and fold catastrophe have @xmath45 .",
    "note that both @xmath40 and @xmath46 are observables in the sense that they can be derived without ambiguity for each observed lens system as long as the lens galaxy is identified : we do not have to perform mass modeling to compute these quantity from observations . in summary ,",
    "our task of this paper is to explore model dependences of reduced time delay @xmath34 as a function of image configurations parameterized by @xmath40 and @xmath46 .",
    "in this section , we analytically examine the behavior of the reduced time delay @xmath34 ( eq . [ [ eq : xi_def ] ] ) for various lens potentials , before showing the distribution of @xmath34 for realistic complicated mass distributions . for this purpose ,",
    "it is convenient to study in terms of multipole expansion : we consider the lens potential of the following from @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the dimensionless amplitude and @xmath49 is the position angle .",
    "the coefficients are chosen such that @xmath50 becomes the einstein radius of the system if the amplitude of the monopole term is @xmath51 .",
    "note that an external shear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be described by this expression as @xmath52 and @xmath53 . for this potential",
    "the reduced time delay is given by @xcite : @xmath54 this can be rewritten as @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are defined by @xmath58 @xmath59^{1/2}. \\label{eq : def_x}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we assumed @xmath60 without loss of generality .",
    "note that @xmath40 and @xmath46 were defined in equations ( [ eq : def_rij ] ) and ( [ eq : def_tij ] ) , respectively .",
    "the above expression of @xmath34 ( eq . [ [ eq : def_xi ] ] ) has several important implications .",
    "first , @xmath49 comes only in the last cosine term , thus assuming @xmath61 and @xmath48 is small @xmath62 and @xmath63 occurs equally if @xmath49 is uncorrelated with the image configuration ( as we will see later , however , this is not necessarily the case ) .",
    "this indicates that we can reduce the effect of multipole terms by averaging many lens systems , suggesting the usefulness of our statistical approach .",
    "second , since @xmath64 in most cases , the dependence of the potential ( @xmath65 ) and image configurations ( @xmath40 and @xmath46 ) on the deviation from @xmath66 is encapsulated in @xmath57 , aside from the overall amplitude @xmath48 . in what follows , we use @xmath57 to study the behavior of @xmath34 .",
    "first , we consider quite symmetric cases ( @xmath67 ) for which images are nearly the same distance from the lens center .",
    "depending on the opening angles , limiting behaviors are given by @xmath68 therefore , @xmath57 diverges unless @xmath69 .",
    "more rigorously , we should take the limit of @xmath67 and @xmath70 : @xmath71^{1/2},\\ ] ] indicating that the divergence at the symmetric limit can be avoided if @xmath72 , or more appropriately @xmath73 .",
    "since close image pairs are always near the circumference of the critical curve that has a nearly circular shape centered on the lens galaxy , such pairs in general have @xmath74 , indicating the divergence can not be avoided for two close images .",
    "on the other hand , the divergence may not occur for opposite images ( @xmath44 ) , but only if @xmath75 is even number .",
    "inversely , if images are very asymmetric ( @xmath76 ) , @xmath57 reduces to the following simple form @xmath77 this does not depends on @xmath46 , thus the opening angle is no longer important in this situation .",
    "however it shows stronger dependence on the radial slope @xmath65 .",
    "finally we plot @xmath57 for various parameter values in figures [ fig : x_ana_r ] and [ fig : x_ana_t ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : x_ana_r ] , @xmath57 is plotted as a function of the asymmetry @xmath40 .",
    "it grows quite rapidly as @xmath40 approaches to zero for @xmath78 .",
    "it also shows stronger sensitivity on the slope @xmath65 at larger @xmath40 .",
    "as is clear in figure [ fig : x_ana_t ] , the opening angle @xmath46 becomes more important for more symmetric lenses .",
    "all these behaviors are consistent with analytical arguments presented above .",
    "in this section , we consider more realistic situations to in order to study expected spread of the reduced time delay @xmath34 as a function of image configurations .",
    "specifically we adopt theoretically and observationally determined distributions of lens potentials such as ellipticities , external shear , substructures , and multipole components to make predictions on realistic probability distributions of @xmath34 .",
    "the methodology is similar to that in @xcite who studied cusp and fold relations to identify lenses with small - scale structure .      as primary lens galaxies we only consider elliptical galaxies because most ( @xmath79% ) of quasar lenses are caused by massive elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we model the lens galaxy as a power - law elliptical mass distribution .",
    "the surface mass distribution is given by @xmath80^{2-\\alpha},\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the einstein ring radius and @xmath81 is the position angle of ellipse .",
    "the case @xmath82 corresponds to the standard singular isothermal mass distribution .",
    "the ellipticity @xmath83 , which is defined by @xmath84 with @xmath85 being the axis ratio of the ellipse , is related to @xmath86 by @xmath87 the corresponding lens potential can be described by @xmath88 with @xmath89 being the complex function of @xmath29 , but notice that @xmath90 if @xmath91 .",
    "many previous work has shown that lens galaxies indeed have nearly isothermal mass distribution .",
    "@xcite obtained @xmath92 by combining the einstein radii of many lensed quasars with the fundamental plane relation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the slope of the galaxy density profile @xmath93 constrained from the faint third image of pmn j1632@xmath940033 is consistent with the nearly isothermal density profile @xcite .",
    "detailed mass modeling of b1933 + 503 also indicates nearly isothermal profile of the lens galaxy @xcite . by using measured velocity dispersions of lens galaxies of several lensed quasars , (",
    "* see also @xcite ) derived @xmath95 .",
    "@xcite put tighter constrains @xmath96 , but the results are derived from a sample of much lower redshift lens systems than typical time delay quasars . from these results , in this paper we adopt the gaussian distribution @xmath97 as a conservative input distribution of the slope . uncertainty .",
    "however , we note that the result of @xcite were drawn from only five lensed quasar systems and therefore scatter should be large . moreover , many of lens systems used by @xcite appear to reside in dense environments , which may explain their large value of @xmath98 .",
    "indeed , @xcite used a larger sample of 22 lenses to derive the slope that is more consistent with our input distribution . ] for the ellipticity , we use the gaussian distribution with median @xmath99 and dispersion @xmath100 that is consistent with observed distributions of isodensity contour shapes of elliptical galaxies @xcite .    to allow more complex mass distribution of the galaxy ,",
    "we add higher order multipole terms to the potential : @xmath101 the factor @xmath102 is inserted such that @xmath103 denotes the standard parametrization for the deviation of the mass density from an ellipsoid .",
    "we include only @xmath104 and @xmath105 terms , because @xmath106 perturbations have generally not been reported . for",
    "both @xmath107 and @xmath108 , the amplitudes are distributed by the gaussian with mean zero and dispersion @xmath109 that is roughly consistent with reported distributions @xcite .",
    "it is also compatible with the level of the deviation inferred from individual modeling of lensed quasar systems @xcite .",
    "we assume that position angles of these multipole perturbations and that of an ellipsoid are uncorrelated with each other .",
    "in addition , we neglect the correlation of @xmath83 and @xmath108 @xcite for simplicity .",
    "note that these multipole perturbations do not affect @xmath34 if the lens galaxy is isothermal , @xmath82 , but can change quantitative results when combined with non - isothermal profiles and/or other small - scale structures .",
    "since the effect of @xmath108 itself is small , we expect the effect of the correlation between @xmath83 and @xmath108 , which we have neglected here , is also small .",
    "we also include external perturbations that are known to be important for individual mass modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the potential of lowest order external shear is given by @xmath110 we adopt a log - normal distribution with median @xmath111 and dispersion 0.2 dex for the distribution of shear amplitude .",
    "it is consistent with expected shear distribution from @xmath112-body simulations @xcite . in addition to external shear , we consider third order external perturbation @xcite @xmath113 .",
    "\\label{eq : pot_e3}\\ ] ] here we assumed the external perturber is a singular isothermal object to relate the amplitudes and position angles of @xmath114 and @xmath115 terms . in general we have @xmath116 @xcite , thus for the amplitude we adopt a log - normal distribution with median @xmath117 and dispersion 0.2 dex .",
    "the adopted amplitude is roughly consistent with values obtained from mass modeling of individual lens systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we allow small mis - alignment of the position angle @xmath118 , which could happen when the external perturber is not spherical , by adopting the gaussian distribution around @xmath119 with dispersion @xmath120 .",
    "finally we consider substructures in the lens galaxy .",
    "a significant fraction of substructures ( subhalos ) in galaxies have been predicted as a natural consequence of cold dark matter cosmology @xcite .",
    "anomalous flux ratios observed in many gravitational lens systems indicate that substructures are indeed present @xcite .",
    "note that small perturbations may also come from small halos along the line - of - sight @xcite .",
    "although time delays are thought to be less sensitive to small - scale structure than flux ratios that are determined by the second derivative of the time delay surface , they might be affected to some extent particularly when two images are close to each other .",
    "we model each subhalo by pseudo - jaffe ( truncated singular isothermal ) profile .",
    "the lens potential of this profile is @xmath121,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath122 is a truncation radius and @xmath123 is a mass normalization that coincides the einstein radius for sufficiently large @xmath122 .",
    "we adopt @xmath124 assuming the truncation radius of the tidal radius of the subhalo ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the velocity distribution we assume @xmath125 inside three times the einstein radius of the lens galaxy , where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are velocity dispersions of the subhalo and halo , respectively .",
    "the velocities can be converted to @xmath123 through @xmath128 .",
    "we distribute subhalos randomly with an uniform spatial density in the projected two - dimensional plane in order to take account of the suggested anti - bias of the subhalo spatial distribution @xcite .",
    "the resulting mass fraction of subhalos at around the einstein radius is @xmath129% , being consistent with the expectation from @xmath112-body simulations and analytic calculation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the effect of subhalos is described by the sum of the lens potential of each subhalo : @xmath130 here we subtracted the convergence averaged over all subhalos , @xmath131 , to conserve the total mass and radial profile of the lens galaxy .",
    "we include only 100 most massive subhalos mainly for computational reason , but small subhalos are expected to have only very small effect on time delays .",
    "using the model described above , we perform a large monte - carlo simulation containing @xmath132 lensed image pairs .",
    "the simulation is done by first generating a lens potential according to the distributions summarized in ",
    "[ sec : pot_input ] .",
    "all lengths are scaled by the einstein ring radius @xmath133 : since our results do not depend on adopted length scales , we fix @xmath133 to unity in the simulations .",
    "we generate 10000 different lens potentials in total . for each lens potential",
    ", we place random sources with an uniform density of @xmath134 in the source plane .",
    "we use a public software _ lensmodel _",
    "@xcite to solve the lens equation and compute time delays between multiple images .",
    "the uniform sampling in the source plane indicates that each lens potential is automatically weighted by the lensing cross section ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to account for magnification bias as well ,",
    "for each source we compute the total magnification factor @xmath135 , and when constructing probability distributions of reduced time delays ( see below ) we include a weight of @xmath136 , where @xmath85 is a power - law slope of the luminosity function of source quasars .",
    "we adopt @xmath137 that is relevant for lenses identified by the class @xcite .    from the ensemble of image pairs , we compute conditional probability distribution functions of the reduced time delay @xmath34 for given values of the asymmetry @xmath40 and/or opening angle @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 . the probability distributions are computed separately for double and quadruple lenses to see how different distributions they exhibit . in what",
    "follow we ignore central faint images that are unobserved in most cases .      before presenting results that include all potentials , it is useful to see how each potential affects the distribution of @xmath34 . to see this we adopt isothermal elliptical lens potential plus multipole terms ( @xmath141 , @xmath82 ) , and add each lens potential : since the isothermal galaxy always yields @xmath66 ( see  [ sec : model ] ) the effect of each potential term",
    "can be estimated by the deviation from @xmath66 .",
    "we also study the effect of non - isothermality ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "the results are summarized in figure [ fig : xi_model ] .",
    "first , the effect of external shear appears as a scatter around @xmath66 , which is consistent with discussion above (  [ sec : ana ] ) as well as that of @xcite .",
    "both the diverging scatter at @xmath67 and the modest increase of the scatter at smaller @xmath46 are expected from our analytic examination . the scatter introduced by the third order",
    "external perturbation and subhalos is smaller than that of external shear , but it is still noticeable particularly for symmetric configurations .",
    "this means that even if we can estimate external shear and its orientation accurately for individual lens system by detailed mass modeling , these third order perturbations or subhalos can shift time delays , although these small perturbations mainly affect image pairs with small opening angles and only increase the scatter rather than shift the mean .",
    "we comment that the use of image pairs with small opening angles is also limited by the larger uncertainties of their time delay measurements .",
    "as expected , non - isothermality has a large impact on @xmath34 , but the size of its scatter is less dependent on image configurations compared with other potentials .",
    "it is worth noting that there are systematic deviations from @xmath66 for a few specific image configurations .",
    "for instance , at small @xmath46 external shear preferentially produces image pairs with time delays smaller than the isothermal case .",
    "in addition , very asymmetric image pairs ( @xmath42 ) tend to have larger time delays when we consider non - isothermal lens galaxies .",
    "such systematic shifts were not predicted in our analytic arguments in  [ sec : ana ] , thus invite careful consideration .",
    "we find that the selection effect can explain these systematic shifts .",
    "for very asymmetric pairs , such configurations are possible only when the lens galaxy has a profile steeper than isothermal for which inner critical curve is degenerated at the center . if the density profile is shallower than isothermal , any images ( expect central faint images that we ignore in this paper ) are outside the inner critical curve .",
    "this means that very asymmetric configuration , in which one image lies very close to the center of the lens potential , never occurs for the profile shallower than isothermal .",
    "since shallower profiles correspond to smaller @xmath34 , this increases the mean @xmath34 at @xmath42 .",
    "the effect of external shear is more complicated , but can be explained as follows . consider a close pair of two images .",
    "if we add external shear whose position angle direction is perpendicular to the segment that connects the two images , it separates two images . on the other hand ,",
    "external shear that is parallel to the segment makes the two images closer .",
    "therefore , combined with the steep dependence of the frequency of close image pairs on the opening angle , this results in the situation that at fixed small opening angle the direction of external shear is more likely to be parallel to the segment than perpendicular .",
    "the discussion in ",
    "[ sec : ana ] indicates that the parallel shear yields smaller time delays @xmath63 for fixed image positions , thus we can conclude that close image pairs have statistically smaller time delays than those expected without external shear .",
    "we are now ready to compute conditional probability distributions of the reduced time delay @xmath34 with all lens potentials presented in  [ sec : pot_input ] .",
    "figure [ fig : dist ] shows contours of constant conditional probability projected to one - dimensional surface , @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the behaviors of contours can well be understood from discussions in  [ sec : ana ] and  [ sec : pot_pot ] .",
    "in particular , systematically small @xmath34 at small opening angles and large @xmath34 for very asymmetric image pairs , which we discussed in  [ sec : pot_pot ] , are clearly seen .",
    "it appears quadruple lenses have larger scatter on average : this is because strong perturbations ( external shear , third order perturbation and subhalos ) , which cause the scatter around @xmath66 , also enhance the lensing cross section for quadruple images .    to study the conditional probability distribution as a function of both @xmath40 and @xmath46 , @xmath143 , in figure [ fig : cont ] we plot contours of median and 68% confidence interval of the probability distribution in the @xmath40-@xmath46 plane .",
    "the features we have discussed , such as the divergence of scatter at @xmath67 , smaller median time delays for small opening angle pairs , larger median time delays for asymmetric pairs , can be seen in this figure as well .",
    "in addition , the scatter presented here is useful to check which lens systems are less dependent on lens potentials : our result indicates that asymmetric image pairs that are collinear with their lens galaxies ( @xmath44 ) have the least scatter and therefore are more suitable for the determination of the hubble constant .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the statistical sense double lenses are more valuable than quadruple lenses because it shows a smaller sensitivity to various lens potentials .",
    "in addition , double lenses have advantages of easier measurements of time delays in observations and smaller fractional errors ( because double lenses have longer time delays than quads ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus our input strength of external shear might be somewhat smaller than the true one ( see also discussion in  [ sec : dis ] ) .",

    "we perform the same analysis excluding these two systems and find the hubble constant to be @xmath329 at 68% confidence from the effective chi - square .",
    "therefore our result is not biased significantly by these systems .",
    "] we note that in our method we can in principle include non - gaussianity by just replacing @xmath330 in equation ( [ eq : like ] ) with any appropriate probability distributions , as long as we know such distributions .",
    "in this paper , we have studied time delays between multiply imaged quasars . adopting the reduced time delay , which is a measure of how the lens potential is complicated compared with the simple isothermal form",
    ", we have explored the dependence of time delays on various complex structure of lens potentials such as external perturbations , non - isothermality , and substructures .",
    "the distribution of time delays has been studied as a function of image configuration which we characterize using two dimensionless quantities , the asymmetry and opening angle of an image pair .",
    "we have pointed out that the sensitivity on lens potentials is quite dependent on the image configuration .",
    "for instance , more symmetric image pairs are more affected by a small change of the lens potential .",
    "image pairs with smaller opening angles are also more sensitive to lens potentials . in particular time delays of close image pairs",
    "are very sensitive to higher - order external perturbations and substructures that are very hard to be constrained from mass modeling even for best studied lens systems .",
    "in addition , those pairs usually have the largest relative uncertainties of time delay measurements .",
    "therefore we conclude that it is quite difficult to extract any information on the hubble constant or the mass distribution from close image pairs .",
    "it is interesting to note that perturbations on lens potential not only introduce scatter around the mean but also can systematically shift the distribution of time delays .",
    "one such example is smaller time delays for smaller opening angle image pairs , which is caused by external shear .",
    "we have performed monte - carlo simulations to derive a probability distribution of reduced time delays for each image configuration .",
    "input distributions are determined from observational and theoretical constraints .",
    "the distribution is weighted by the lensing cross section and magnification bias , allowing a realistic estimate of time delay distributions .",
    "the probability distribution was then compared with observed time delays .",
    "we have shown that the distribution of time delays computed from our simulations is in good agreement with observed time delays .",
    "in particular , distributions of observed time delays also exhibit strong dependence of image configuration in a consistent manner with our theoretical expectations . the probability distribution can be used to constrain the hubble constant .",
    "we have found that 16 published time delay quasars constrain it to be @xmath326 at 68% confidence using the effective chi - square or @xmath328 estimated using jackknife resampling , consistent with other estimates .",
    "an important caveat is that our lensed quasar sample is quite heterogeneous .",
    "in particular , it should be noted that current time delay quasars ( see table [ tab : xi ] ) have significantly larger image separations on average compared with the other quasar lenses : the median image separation of time delay quasars listed in table [ tab : xi ] is @xmath331 ( image separations before and after the median are @xmath332 and @xmath333 ) , whereas that of all lensed quasars is @xmath334 .",
    "quasar lenses with larger image separations are more likely to lie in dense environments because both the image separation and biased cross section are boosted by surrounding dark matter @xcite , thus the hubble constant inferred from those lenses are more affected by the environmental convergence .",
    "indeed , the association of group / cluster has been reported for more than half of the time delay quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , our input distributions of external perturbations may be underestimated for these large separation lenses . to estimate this systematic effect ,",
    "we exclude four lensed quasars with image separation larger than @xmath335 and repeat the analysis done in  [ sec : hub ] .",
    "the resulting hubble constant @xmath336 at 68% confidence from the effective chi - square is consistent with our full result , thus we conclude that the effect of lens galaxy environments is not so drastic here . however , to minimize the systematic effect , in the future we should apply our statistical method to well - defined samples of lensed quasars such as the class @xcite , sqls @xcite , and those obtained in future lens surveys .",
    "another source of the systematic effect is the uncertainty of our input distribution of lens potentials . among others ,",
    "the most important systematic error comes from the uncertainty of the mean value of the slope of the radial profile , @xmath98 . while @xmath82 ( isothermal ) for the mean appears to be a reasonable choice , direct studies of lens galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that the error on the mean @xmath98 could be as large as 0.1 .",
    "the derived hubble constant depends on the slope as @xmath337 , therefore the change of the mean @xmath98 systematically shifts the best - fit value .",
    "the scaling relation suggests that the 0.1 error of the mean results in 10% error on @xmath318 , indicating that the systematic error may be even larger than the statistical error .",
    "another important systematic effect is caused by external convergence from lens galaxy environments . since its effect on the hubble constant",
    "is straightforward ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one can estimate the effect of external convergence rather easily even without including the distribution in the simulation . from the result of @xcite",
    ", we expect that the posterior distribution of external convergence with lensing bias taken into account is roughly @xmath338 unless the image separation is too large .",
    "this , combined with the fact that the hubble constant scales as @xmath339 , suggest that the effect of external convergence is not so dominant here ( note that external convergence was already taken into account for two extreme lenses , q0957 + 561 and rxj0911 + 0551 ) . by including rough estimates of these two systematic errors , we obtain @xmath340 , indicating the importance of reducing the systematic error .    since the hubble constant",
    "is now determined fairly well by other methods , time delays are sometimes used to study mass distributions of lens objects .",
    "our statistical technique offers a new method to study the lens mass distribution . by comparing the probability distributions for different input distributions of lens potentials ( e.g. , different median slopes of the primary lens galaxy ) ,",
    "one can infer which input model is most plausible .",
    "unlike previous statistical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this new method allows us to include various complexity of lens potentials relatively easily , particularly the non - spherically symmetric nature of lens potentials .",
    "we note that our input distribution of lens potentials was designed for galaxies , but it is straightforward to modify it to that of lensing by other populations , e.g. , lensing by a cluster of galaxies .    in summary ,",
    "our new statistical approach is invaluable for the study of both cosmological parameters and structure of lens potentials .",
    "we believe its importance grows more and more in the era of large - scale synoptic surveys such as lsst and snap : quasar lens candidates are easily recognized in these synoptic surveys by making use of strong time variability of quasars @xcite .",
